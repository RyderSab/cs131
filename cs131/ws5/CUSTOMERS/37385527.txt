I also wrote a paper for MacIntosh College in my Art History course.  It is about 20 pages+ long, and reflects my knowledge of the Passaconaway area of the National Forest, where I attended the last UNH Forestry Camp in 1964, and first learned of this legend and lore from Dr. Clark Stevens.  Now, there is a resurgence of interest in this old art form of seeing the creator in these works of nature--for which this beautiful area is so famous.<br /><br />Congrats to Dartmouth's Bob McGrath for producing such a painstaking piece of work on this school.  Also look for Catherine Crawford's book on indexing all the available paintings she could note in her book for the Forest Society.  John Henderson has a great web page on them, too.<br /><br />I produced an article for the MountainEar newspaper after this course, in time for the annual sales of these historic paintings by enthusiastic collectors.  There will also soon be an exhibition and interpretative display in a newly constructed Intervale Overlook building in North Conway, where this scene attracted many of the old artists in its time.	2005-05-14

I love the White Mountain School of art as an offshoot of the Hudson River School, and this is a must-have for those enthusiasts of this great American school of landscape painting.  Here in North Conway, we are seeing a resugence from those collectors who are now searching down paintings from that era, and we will soon have an exhibit at the new state building at the Intervale Overlook--where many of the old artists painted this scene of the pastoral views towards Mt. Washington.<br /><br />I wrote an Art History paper using this book and others as references, and it is available at the Conway, NH library. Albert Bierstadt's famous painting of North Moat Mountain was painted from this locale.  It is on the cover of Bob McGrath's book, GODS IN GRANITE, and is available as a print from the Currier Gallery in Manchester, NH.	2005-05-14

He also flashes backwards and forwards with his life before Vietnam and then returning on rice business much later.  In so doing, he develops the very story we all went through as young men in college in the early to mid-sixties, who did not mind a military obligation or the hardships of deployment to SE Asia, and served well.  (This is three books in one.)<br /><br />I was a helicopter pilot with the 175th Outlaws and know the Vi Thanh area well.  IT was a very hostile province, and the VC owned it and all the territory to Rach Gia and the U Minh Forest.  Tom Hargrove describes life with the MACV teams very specifically, and superbly addresses their thoughts and intentions while living so sparsely.  The dangers of interactions with the local VN are so typical; it is a wonder we all survived our valiant attempts at pacification.<br /><br />This necessary book covers the Advisor side of the war, which was much more commonplace than the conventional war, being waged \\"Up North\\" with the American divisions.  For those of you who want to read about this realistic Vietnam conflict in the hinterlands, read this book of outpost living and agrarian assistance to these poor rice paddy farmers.  Way to go, Tom!! It was always nice to climb back into our Huey and return to Vinh Long after resupplying you guys!  A lot of truth here, and maybe it has taken all these years to get it out--the way we lived our war in the Delta...	2005-04-14

I flew a Jet Ranger helicopter on the North Slope in 1969, and came down through the Anatuvik Pass, after refueling on the Eskimo village's landing strip there.  The adventures these two have in their old Cessna Skyhawk (which I took my first flying lessons in) are so reminiscent of any bush pilots perplexities.  And, I remembered I endured them!  One of my buddies in VN was from Miles City, and another had me Mule deer hunting out near the Big Bend where Vose has his strip and homestead. But, I don't need to fly like this anymore!!<br /><br />What I did like about the book is how much Alan knows about the American West, almost on a Lewis and Clark experience, and more of the USA public should be aware of this landscape's history.  He has a clever way of sharing ecological knowledge, and I wish more authors did.  My only complaint so far about the book, is that Knopf really needed to supply a better copy-editor than it did.  I need a few commas now and then!  Many times I was into a paragraph, and tried to go back and see what was being said!<br /><br />But, that is where the publishing world is today....

By defining the VN war solely within its own borders, we not only lost this conflict, but left behind many Americans who we would not recognize that were somewhere else than Vietnam.  Then, the Paris \\"Peace\\" Accords  really sealed their fate.  Nixon and Kissinger should have been shown with their pants down to their ankles for their miserable \\"accomplishments\\" to end the war.  The North Vietnamese let us bring our remaining troops home, then attacked; Thieu knew it was going to happen.<br /><br />Nigel Cawthorne shows what happened to South Vietnam and our POW's once they got rid of the pesky Americans, who had been an intrusion for 25 years, after they demolished the French.  We have yet to respect this enemy, and also all our vets who worked so hard in this hopeless fracas.  The most amazing part of the book to was about the 3.25 billion dollars of reparations that Nixon agreed to, on White House stationary; that was the bargaining chip to bring these poor souls home.  We violated them as well as ourselves by the bozo's we had in the Nixon Administration, and are still paying the price, both at home and overseas in IndoChina.  I am glad that I never got shot down and suffered the fate of our military men who were sadly betrayed by this country and continue to be so.  More and more, the experiences I portray in OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM were thankfully the only ones I still have to report...!	2005-03-13

This is my Master's \\"professional paper\\" of approximately 237 pages+ on the excessing of the property belonging to the Sand Point Naval Air Station in Lake Washington, Seattle.  As a graduate student at UW's College of Forest Resources, I interviewed many of the players who all desired this promontory extending into this prominent urban lake, and it was an interesting process in 1973-74.  All had valid reasons for needing this landscape, and were in great contention for the federally released property.  I presented each of their views fairly, and they all commented I had represented their cases well.  After successfully obtaining my Master's degree, I went back to the various offices, and Xeroxed the bulky document for their keeping.  It remains in an unbound condition.  I do appreciate its continued existence, and also the eventual condition of Sand Point for all to enjoy in its present form.  What an ecological contest to cover!!	2005-02-13

It certainly was, and I devoured it for quite a few nights on end.  It has some brutal horror to it, and makes me glad I am not a cop nor continued in the service.  The physical Vietnam Broker returns to is probably just as described, and I have never had any wish to revisit.  Trin is accurately described as a Vietnamese, and I can picture the life these former VC veterans and ARVNS had after 1975.  The only complaint I would venture about the novel is that it is hard for me to believe some really tight vets would have this much intrigue between each other at all.  Much too evil.  I would assume their relationships would be more like Trin's and Broker's.  However, the book is a real page-turner and I look forward to many works from author Chuck Logan.  In the meantime, we former helicopter pilots should produce more on our Huey flying experiences! OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM is my contribution and can be found here on Amazon, too.	2004-12-25

It is a good historical account all the way through the Vietnam war, in various corps, which I always enjoy reading from those who had numerous tours there, military or journalistic.  The sweep of reality in various minds as the war progresses over time and place is always an interesting insight for me.  I served in the Mekong Delta during 1966-67, with the 175th Outlaws as a helicopter pilot.  There we witnessed much of what John Laurence describes throughout this lengthy book--in that he is trying to record the pilots' and grunts' memories and emotions while he visits with them.  He always admits the shortcomings of not being able to stay in the field with them, and that is a very interesting aspect of this well-written book.  My book, OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM, covers the life of we helicopter pilots at Vinh Long, but this descriptive work  by Laurence is exacting over time with his experiences, and those of newsmen and military personnel around him.  As a voyage through time in RVN, I see it as a valuable addition to my personal library of books written on the Vietnam Conflict.  This  is a keeper, and will last.	2003-08-15

However, my delight in reading it was its constant education on the Army life, and I find this book along with Hackworth's \\"ABOUT FACE\\" worth recommending--if one is interested in this service.  Norman Schwarzkopf's \\"IT DOESN'T TAKE A HERO\\" could be added to these two.  My own veteran experience was in flying Hueys in the Mekong Delta, and I have documented several episodes in my book \\"OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM\\" similar to these stories. We are losing knowledge of the military life, as many are not required to enter the service today, as was previously true.

We both flew helicopters about the same time in Vietnam.  Luckily I flew in the Mekong Delta, and did not have to deal much with the jungles and trees as described in this book.  Only once or twice did the Outlaws of the 175th have to go \\"up-North\\" and risk the hazards these pilots commonly underwent northwest of Saigon. Lotsa teak trees and agent Orange!<br />As a result, I feel I have to comment on the amount of contact with tropical vegetation as expressed within this book! We would have lost our aircraft commander orders with the blade strikes this pilot reveals!

His writing in this book is richer and more descriptive than I was prepared for, and I went through his entire captivity with him, while reading it.  This sorrowful horror could have happened to any of us in the Delta, and this expereince should be required reading for anyone interested in that war.

Halberstam portrays these people who have somehow risen to the top after their civilian days bureaucraticaly involved with the Vietnam War.  Mostly it scarred them instead of educating them. As a former helicopter pilot of that conflict, I hold them in as high a disdain as I did then.  David Halberstam shows how these types proliferate around administrations such as Clinton's and cannot get off the dime making a decision.  The book for me showed that even the news media sees no point in having war correspondents any more, and so the American public is kept in a high state of ambivalence while these post cold-war events play out.  I have recommended reading this illlustrative book to any who are pondering our forthcoming possible war with Iraq.  We cannot get \\"out of the box\\" following the Vietnam days.  I am glad to be a veteran Army aviator instead--it has given me a much healthier stance upon life. Read my book OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM, and talk to a chopper pilot sometime....	2002-11-02

We flew a lot of single ship missions in support of MACV and USAID; thank God our seriousness was about flying the Huey.<br />Read further about our side of the war with OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM; my book on flying UH-1D's out of Vinh Long in the Delta.

We young men went to Vietnam, with our ROTC commissions and degrees delivered, to go through an experience which only our generation (that before the flower-power war protesters 3 years later) could know about.  John Irving's works seem to express the exasperating knowledge that we acquired as young college students of the 1961-1965 time period.  His pain is ours and this novel expresses the moments before everyone knew what could only come with time.  My book, OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM, tells of the helicopter flying we performed in the Delta in 1966-67, and during our exploits we realized a great deal of what he writes about in this book.  It will continue to be a favorite of mine.	2002-08-24

This is a great book by Gen. Brandt typifying the events and life-style experienced at this early moment in Vietnam. The H-21's are graphically described in all their quirks and needs, as well as the skillful men who had to fly them. I find the earliest years of VN helicopter warfare fascinating to read, as these men not only laid down the tracks for we later aviators to utilize in mid-sixties on, but they quickly found out the political reality of Vietnam--which never changed.  As Halberstam has stated, \\"the war was lost in 1964, not at the end of its duration.\\" Our aviator job was tremendously enjoyed by all of us, but the Washington administrations never totally got it what a fluky scenario Vietnam was.  We helicopter pilots surely got it, though.	2002-07-16

She represents the NOW, the reality we would experience if we were in his shoes on a clandestine operation.  Imagine travelling with a woman of her age, who never, ever experienced the Vietnam war as so many did in their present 45-55 year-old age brackets.<br />I would not want to revisit RVN as so many veterans seem to, because I believe it is now this place just as described by the author.  He is very smart creating this mystery, but it is all too real for one who has known this strange, tropical nation.<br />My only question is, after reading 200 pages so far, in one sitting, is what is the reason he misspells Tan Son Nhut??  (Nhat)  Or Beer 33, Ba-Muoi-Ba?? (Ba ba ba)??  How come?<br />I don't get it, when everything is so in place.  But, I think all vets will feel the creeps reading this novel--it just takes you on a trip that seems so accurate, so why go back??! UP COUNTRY will serve very well instead. I will leave my flying memories of a '65 D-model Huey in my mind, and in my book, thank you.  I would not want to traverse this communist country today.

Hopefully, more of these excellent aviators will be profiled in the future.<br />My librarian finally purchased the book after these initial notes, and I have been reading it nonstop.  This should really shed some light on the horror of the Americal Division higher-ups who authorized this bloodletting by Lt. Calley and others of Charlie Company that day.  They had been ordered to commit the atrocities we all know about today, and as I continue the book, it is interesting to me to experience the angst that Hugh Thompson and his crew felt that terrible day at My Lai.  He is most human, and painfully so. The author discloses all this helicopter crew went through then and since; well done!!	2002-03-01

It seems that a new generation of writers that often publish in the outdoors magazines like Backpacker or Outside are discovering the WW II eccentrics who are well known to us, their sons and nephews, as being the aviators and mechanics of the past who won the air war over Japan and Germany.  As a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War, these men were our former mentors and role models.  We went where we were sent and didn't question the duty or the reality of it all.  Later, after finishing my tour in the Army, I flew the bush in Alaska, and this book reminded me of my early days on the North Slope, flying a Bell Jet Ranger with a seismic crew in the Colville River Delta.  I was the furthest west chopper pilot during those spring months of 1969, and about the third youngest Army pilot to arrive on this edge of the Arctic Ocean.  We flew around Prudhoe Bay and astonished many of the old bush pilots with our know-how and amount of flight time at such a young age.  The B-29 story made me reminisce about those months up there, when anything could happen and did.  Lot of fun and a lot of misery!  Somehow, one has to go through these extremes in a swashbuckling manner to relate to these early aviation stories before GPS and much safe devices came about today.

I must say the book is presented in a dispassionate way, but chronicles the movement of our involvement in this far Asian country over the years, as young people need to know about.  I was a helicopter pilot in the Mekong Delta, stationed at Vinh Long with the 175th Outlaws, one of the most affectionate helicopter units in-country.  I am very familiar with many of the episodes and locales featured in the book.  I would recommend PORTRAIT OF A TRAGEDY as an historical overview of the conflict, but it lacks the passion of the years describing all that went on--there and in the USA.  It is well constructed, and for those people who cannot figure why we ever got involved in this entanglement, it could present the situation in a rational dialogue for them to think about.  My book centers on the experiences of flying helicopters and the camaraderie experienced by the Army aviators in this war.	2002-02-15

Norman Schwarzkopf	Books	5	3	4	N	N	IT DOESN'T TAKE A HERO	I received this book as a Christmas present from a fellow Vietnam veteran a few years back, at the conclusion of Desert Storm.  It is interesting to see the difference between Norman Schwarzkopf's two tours in Vietnam.  During the first tour, he is avidly impressed with the Vietnamese Airborne troops he is advising, and has a comfortable time back at West Point recounting his experiences.  The second time is with the Americal Division, and there is all the contrast in the world between these two assignments.  Such works have been helpful to me as a Vietnam vet, and I relish my time as a helicopter pilot in the Mekong Delta in 1966-67 all the more, especially because I had neither of these experiences.  I was lucky.  This book is a keeper, and a wonderful portrayal of conducting the war in the desert of Iraq.	2002-02-15

My experiences were in the Delta, where I think we had a greater variety of tasks and episodes to discuss and carry out.  My time with the Outlaws of the 175th Avn. Company were far more enjoyable that being \\"up-north\\" with these American units described. I know what I missed. Still, it is good that some of us helicopter pilots have recorded our flying deeds in this once-in-a-lifetime experience, one we treasure now that we survived it!! Chuck salutes many of his fellow pilots at the end of the book and shows that many Vietnam vets are now successful men of stature and success in their communities.	2002-02-15

It is because several truths were combined from several people's real exploits to write this vivid book. Jerold Greenfield's hand is very much evident in constructing this book because many of the helicopter pilots who flew in Vietnam can't adequately express themselves in the print media. (There are few writers from this group.) They do tell war stories very well--and loudly!! Marvicsin obviously got a lot of help from this professional writer in helping to express how the guys felt and talked, and he has taken some heat for this.  This style is a difficult thing to accomplish, and is the book's major feat. Another accomplishment is showing the difference many experienced between their two tours; later was almost always bad.<br />I have written a book myself on the Outlaws, which were the most affectionate aviation group in all of Vietnam, and many remain close to his day. \\"Once an Outlaw, always an Outlaw--but once a Knight is enough!\\"<br />Anyone stationed at Vinh Long remains long in its grip; it was the best year of our lives, no matter when the tour occurred or other aviation experiences later.  Now, that is something highly unusual for any Vietnam vet to say!!<br />Fort Wolters is gone, Vinh Long is gone, and we only have these attempts at recapturing those long ago days in the books we write.	2002-02-15

He was with the Marines \\"up north,\\" and I was in the Delta--as an Army aviator with the 175th Outlaws.  Vinh Long was a great place to be stationed, and I missed out on many of the experiences Bruce writes about because of that.  We were in considerable high contrast to many of the Army aviators' tours from my flight school class of 66-14, too. Bruce tells what it was like to fly the CH 46, the standard tandem rotorcraft of the Marines in this war, as we flew Huey slicks and gunships in our branch of service.  I highly recommend this book by my friend, who self-published as I did, and has now nearly sold out all he printed.  Keep-a-going, Bruce!	2002-02-15

It seems that the WW II vets who went through the horrors described have needed a writer of a younger generation to adequately express their combat heroics.  The older men were too close-lipped.  When John Bradley says, \\"The real heroes didn't come back,\\" what he means is that they were doing something heroic right up to the time they got blown up.  Imagine seeing someone you devoutly esteem completely destroyed by a direct hit from an artillery shell--right in front of your very eyes, a man you have been following for some time and depend upon.  No one in this country today will ever have such an experience.  If these men's times were not chronicled in the apt descriptions this book portrays, we would not know what American males went through during intense moments of fighting the Japanese, in these times.  Read and hold onto \\"Flags of our Fathers\\"--it may be the closest you'll ever come to knowing what live combat is about. We never, ever, went through something this bad in the Vietnam war, except for some moments at Khe Sanh of Hamburger Hill.  But as the sons and nephews of these men, we knew the job we had to do following their example.  Thank God I was a helicopter pilot instead of an infantry platoon leader.	2002-02-15

The accounts are vivid and help to portray Marine combat infantrymen experiences in I-Corps.  The book did help me to format my story of flying UH-1D helicopters in the Mekong Delta; I liked the set-up  of the chapters and untilized this aspect.  I wasn't  too interested in the Christianity thing North gets into on his return trip; it certainly is true that this is what has anchored his life--but this is not much of a Vietnam vet story. It still is on my bookshelf, however, for the reasons expressed below by the other reviewers.	2002-02-15

I thought it a little errorneous over time, as Vietnam has healed up surprisingly well after all the B-52 strikes cratering the countryside.  As a helicopter pilot with the Outlaws in the Mekong Delta in 1966-67, I too wondered how long our artillery and airstrikes' destruction would affect this small tropical country, so dependent on its rice crop.  However, the real value of this book is about looking deeper at the ethnic conflicts between various groups--that was the root of the problem--far more than we know, and the author produced some information not found somewhere else.  I deeply appreciate the book, and it is a keeper.	2002-02-15

David Halberstam was one of the first outstanding journalists stationed in Saigon, who came down and covered operations in the Delta in the first years of the war. His writing is intense, and always unfailingly accurate. This story here was one of the early books written about the war, and was a \\"bible\\" for those of us who were there in the mid-sixties.  I flew helicopters out of Vinh Long, just up the river from My Tho, and worked with the 7th ARVN Division quite a bit.  I write up my exploits in the book OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM, which is also listed on these Amazon.com pages.  I was stationed with the 13th Aviation Battalion during the years of 1966-67; nothing had changed much from the accounts Halberstam writes of in ONE VERY HOT DAY.

I think the only assiumption a vet like myself can arrive at at this book's conclusion, is BOY, DID WE LOSE THAT WAR!!!  There is no other way to perceive this ending.  They really did us beat us, in every way possible.  Many who do not know much about the Vietnam War (in depth) think--to this day--there is still is something we could have done to win the thing.  My experience as a UH-1D helicopter pilot with the Outlaws in the Mekong Delta in 1966-67 educated me for a year that could not have been accomplished in any other way.

These photographs show the risks these capable photographers took to achieve their results.  It shows who they were and all the circumstances they underwent to portray this war.

It is often a book a caring wife buys for her husband who was over there.  Neil Sheehan obviously went through agony remembering all he could when others wouldn't do anything but forget the subject for years. For me, flying helicopters out of Vinh Long in 1966-67, just up the Mekong River from My Tho where Jon Paul Vann, Halberstam, Arnett, and the rest of the Saigon journalists found out early what the war was about, was embracing a legacy these remarkable men laid down.  We had all the boys and toys then, but found out later in the Tet Offensive of 1968 how misplaced our ideologies really were.  Neil Sheehan stives to paint the picture how all that came about, and has been a healing factor in many VN veteran's lives for this ambiguous information.  Once learned, however, it is easily seen what we could not see at the time.  A fine piece of work--it'll stand the test of time.	2002-02-12

An excerpt had preceded publication and was seen in LOOK Magazine late in 1968.  Many of us in the Outlaws and other units of the Delta Aviation Battalion are proud to still have both copies.  We are still reuniting after all these years, and often refer to this particular book as a cherished keepsake.

Unfortunately, it was one of the worst experiences to have, if you got over there with the Cav during the opening years of the war.  Gen. Moore did a superb job saving the day, but it is obvious the North Vietnamese were learning about our military tactics as well as we were learning about theirs.  As Harold Moore insists at the end of the battle, nothing happened here at this moment, that didn't happen over and over again.  The NVA just hopped over into their Cambodian sanctuaries to regroup and fight us all over again.  The stories of the young officers reminded me of the many young infantry lieutenants and captains that wanted so much to get into the thick of this tropical war back in 1965; the pictures of them with their wives and children show that so much.  Who would believe it today??<br />I'm looking forward to the movie, and recommend Larry Gwin's book BAPTISM on the following days of the Ia Drang massacre which he experienced.  For me, I was glad to be a helicopter pilot in the Delta a few years later with the Outlaws, and miss all this jungle warfare with the Cav; my flight school buddies of the class of 66-14 sure didn't however.  We fleshed out the Cav with our class rather completely!	2002-02-12

The Seven Mountains area is aptly described, as well as the old French minefield at Chi Lang that blew up a Knight aircraft as he depicted.  Phillip Chinnery hung out with some of the VHPA aviators a few years back to garner up these stories, and they are well presented.
