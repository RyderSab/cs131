The usual snappy prose, an intriguing mystery involving a school shooting by two young men who appear to have no discernible motive.  Spenser quickly comes the conclusion that his client is guilty, but feels that extenuating circumstances might to some extent ameliorate his guilt.  How he tracks down those circumstances makes for a very satisfying entry in this long running series.	2005-10-09

The trouble with this series is that there is no one main character, none at least, that we can care about.  Tanaros comes the closest, but he's dismayingly static, obsessing for 1000 years over the wife and king who betrayed him, displaying a sad sense of duty but little growth.  In the end, there was too much prophecy, too much inevitability in this story.  It ends just as it had to, the tagline \\"All things are as they must be,\\" repeated over the course of the book by too many of the characters. The book ends with the hint of more to come, but if there really is a third, I'll skim through it at the bookstore, just to see how it ends. By now, I don't much care.	2005-08-17

Unfortunately, the resolution was simply not believable.  All battered children do not turn into psychopathic monsters, and Dexter's seemingly mystical ability to \\"see\\" what was going on the killer's mind was much too pat.

Unexpectedly, the mystery is solved well before the end of the book, and I found the transition to be a bit jarring.  Previous to this, the protagonist's insights and point of view added depth and resonance to the search for the perpetrator.  Once the mystery was solved, however, the book's focus became entirely the problems of autism, which required that this depiction be accurate.  Since I'm not entirely certain that it is, I found the latter part of the book to be a bit weaker and just a bit of a letdown.	2005-07-25

This book is a transparent attempt to cash in.  First of all, it's short--288 pages filled with very large print. Second, there are some strange mistakes.  For instance, on page 65, the Ant says she found out she was pregnant in 1965 and gave birth in 1966.  I wondered when these books were supposedly taking place.  On page 125, 1966 has turned into 1986.  Oops... I mean, who's editing this? But the biggest problem is that nothing much happens.  Betsy meets a long lost sister who happens to be the Devil's daughter.  It's interesting, but there's not much conflict.  The dialogue is amusing, the characters fun, but this already slim book should have been about half the length, and the other half should have been packed with real events, real issues and real conflict.  Oh, well, maybe the next will be better, but I'll wait for the paperback, or maybe check it out of the library.	2005-07-12
US	52836875	R3BYGIE8H4JZQR	0765309408	219777348	Old Man's War	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Vintage Heinlein	Many of the reviews have taken note of the similarities between this book and Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  The comparison is apt.  The author's style is reminiscent of Heinlein's, as well as both the tone of the book and the plot.  I like this book a lot, but it does have a few weaknesses.  For one, humanity is depicted as weaker than many of the races that we confront, yet our first impulse seems to shoot first and negotiate after, if at all.  Not a smart strategy in a Universe where we have few friends.  This idea is noted in the book but quickly glossed over.  Secondly, the bodies of people who sign up but die before induction into the military are used as clone soldiers, but only one clone per body.  What's the point?  If they want to clone people, why only dead people?  And what are the economics of this project?  Is it really cheaper to clone a body, then raise it, equip it and educate it?  I wonder.  And the ending, quite simply, is just a little too pat, assuming that everything is going to turn out just fine in a universe where the death rate from combat is 75%.  Nevertheless, the books characterization, dialogue and generally engrossing plot make this book much better than the average sci-fi potboiler.  Recommended.	2005-06-06

I cannot understand why she is not better known.  Perhaps part of the reason is the more than ten years between this book and her last, the excellent Queen's Squadron.  A whole generation or readers has grown up never having seen one of her books on the shelf.  The Myriad is a terrific book, with finely drawn, compelling characters and a riveting plot set upon a galactic stage.  I don't want to reveal too much, but the ending left a sour taste in my mouth, negating much of what had gone on before and setting the next books in the series upon an entirely different and unexpected trajectory.  Nevertheless, I will most certainly be looking forward to the next adventure of the crew of the Merrimack.	2005-03-26

Hamilton first gained fame as the author of the Anita Blake, Vampire-Hunter series, the first few of which were tightly plotted fantasy/mysteries, seething with repressed sexuality, highly charged and erotic.  Her last few books in the Anita Blake series, and all three in the Merry Gentry series, are pornography.  This is an observation, not a criticism.  I have nothing against pornography.  I do wonder, however, if all this was deliberate.  Did Laurell Hamilton consciously decide to build an audience before she could be pigeonholed as merely a purveyor of erotica?  Is she only now writing what she had wanted to write all along? <br /> <br />No matter, a purveyor of erotica she is, and a good one, too.  Seduced by Moonlight is the third book in the adventures of Merry Gentry, the only native born Elven American Princess.  The heroine has fled the home of faerie, which lies somewhere in the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri, in order to escape an unending series of assassination attempts by the followers of Merry's very unloving cousin, Prince Cel, who is the only child of the Queen of Air and Darkness.   <br /> <br />Faerie is dying.  The Sidhe have few children, and their magic has faded over the years.  Through a combination of luck and pluck, Merry has rubbed her Aunt's face in the facts of her son's iniquity.  Queen Andais has decreed that whoever first begets a child, Merry or Prince Cel, will inherit the throne of the Unseelie Court.  Since Prince Cel is in prison, Merry would seem to have the inside track, but despite constant and imaginative sex with a horde of guardian lovers, she is not yet pregnant. <br /> <br />As Seduced by Moonlight opens, Merry and her men are temporarily living on the estate of Maeve Reed, a Sidhe exiled from faerie because of her dangerous knowledge regarding Merry's uncle, Taranis, the King of the Seelie Court.  Merry has a dream of power, and when she awakens, an ancient chalice that had been thought lost from faerie is lying next to her in bed.  Merry proceeds to have sex with a number of people, one of them Maeve Reed, all of whom regain godlike powers they had lost many ages before, or gain godlike powers that they had never had.  Merry, as if we had ever doubted it, is special.   <br /> <br />The action of Seduced by Moonlight takes place over a very few days, and the overall arc of the series advances little.  Merry has been invited, first to a feast in her honor at the Unseelie Court, and then to a similar event at the Seelie Court.  The current books ends at the Unseelie Court, with many volumes, presumably, to follow. <br /> <br />Seduced by Moonlight certainly has its weak points.  For one thing, the Sidhe, both the Seelie and Unseelie, are depicted as beautiful, powerful, racist, violent and untrustworthy.  Their problems are, to a large extent, of their own making, and it is difficult to feel much sympathy for their society as a whole.  Europe had exiled the Sidhe  generations before, tired of the internecine warfare that they had caused, and President Thomas Jefferson had offered them sanctuary in America.  One cannot help but feel that Jefferson made a mistake.   <br />Merry, alone among the Sidhe, is \\"mortal.\\"  At one point, a Sidhe noble protests against Merry's possible ascension to the throne, since a mortal Sidhe would, presumably, hasten the demise of their magic.  It is stated that all the Sidhe with whom Merry has \\"shared blood\\" have become mortal.  Doubt is cast upon this point, but it is not refuted.  Merry and her accuser fight a duel, in the course of which they share blood.  The accuser does not become mortal, and Queen Andais offers this, not as proof that Merry's mortality will not contaminate the Sidhe's powers, but rather as proof that Merry is now immortal.  Merry wonders if this is so.  How does it feel to be immortal?  Would she know?  Well, I certainly don't.  How did she know she was mortal in the first place, if she can't tell the difference now?<br /> <br />Do not think from the above that I do not like Seduced by Moonlight.  I like it just fine.  Laurell K. Hamilton's books move along at a breakneck pace, even when they don't go very far.  It's one thing after another and the reader is taken for a wild ride.  Merry is an attractive, sympathetic and very sexy heroine.  The dialogue is hip and snappy, the characterizations, well done.  The overall dilemma is compelling.  Laurell Hamilton has gotten into a nasty habit of having her heroines escape from (and usually kill) the bad guys by suddenly developing a brand new power, just in the nick of time.  This book, thankfully, does not succumb to such an obvious device.  Seduced by Moonlight is a creampuff.  It's light and delicious and mostly air.  It's certainly not \\"high art,\\" but it's never boring and the reader looking for escapist fiction of the more outrageous variety, and who chooses to overlook its obvious flaws, will find it, I think, quite filling enough.   <br />	2004-12-21

Any cookbook can give a list of recipes, and one can almost always find a few good ones, whether the book is from a celebrity chef or whether it's put out by the local lady's club in an effort to raise some money for charity.  What sets the really great cookbooks apart is that they give a method, a set of techniques, which if followed, allow the reader to understand the recipes, to play with them, to embellish them, and to invent his own.  Books like Julia Child's The Way to Cook and Madeline Kamman's In Madeline's Kitchen come to mind.  They make you a better cook.  Paul Kirk's Championship Barbecue is definitely in this company.  He gives the theory and technique of barbecue--the essence of which is slow, low temperature cooking with smoke.  The book is divided into sections, talking about marinades, sops, mops and bastes, rubs, sauces.  In each section he tells why a particular ingredient should be used, always encouraging the reader to use the information and invent his own.  Following are absolutely terrific sections on the barbecing of pork, beef, fowl, seafood and side dishes.  The idea (perhaps conceit would be a better word) that this book is a guide to turning the reader into a barbecue champion is not meant to be taken literally.  Paul Kirk states early on that what sets him (and other champions) apart, is not just the recipe and not just the technique, it is the consummate care with which the technique is applied.  Still, by inviting the reader to reach for the stars, he encourages us to be the best that we can be.  While not many of us will ever have the talent to be barbecue champions, I have no doubt than anybody who loves food and who wants to try, can make absolutely wonderful meals with the help of Paul Kirk's Championship Barbecue.	2004-12-11

By the time I had finished the first 50 pages, I had ordered the next two in the series.  By the time I finished the book, I was regretting it.  Where shall I start?  Eve finally gets around to interviewing the parents of the first victim by page 130, and even then, it's an afterthought.  Ridiculous.  The majority of murders are committed by friends or family.  Even if the parents aren't suspects, they might well have valuable information.  Second, the killer slips videos of the first two murders into Eve's apartment.  Does she increase security? Change the locks? Ask for a police guard?  No.  She goes to sleep.  Baloney.  Third, the Chief of Police, who is obviously crooked, makes Eve deny any link between the two murders. This is patently absurd, and the media immediately picks up on it.  Fourth, Roarke is an arrogant ass, and Eve, a woman who is depicted as not letting herself be pushed around, constantly lets him get away with it.  At one point, he breaks into her apartment and calmly lights up a cigarette.  This  may seem trivial, but non-smokers really, really hate it when they can't get away from cigarettes, and a non-smoker would never allow somebody to smoke in their apartment. It's not \\"strong.\\"  It's not \\"masculine.\\"  It's obnoxious.  Eve and Roarke's entire relationship seems unreal.  He's a cardboard cutout of the Irish rogue who can only be reformed by the love of a good woman and she winds up looking like an idiot for putting up with his garbage for more than an instant.	2004-10-30

Her \\"parents\\" insist that they are, indeed, her biological parents, but Sarah has good reason to suspect that they are not.  She hires Sunny Randall to find out the truth.  The resolution is fairly obvious but reasonable.  What makes this book so interesting is the way that Sarah's emotional problems interact with Sunny's.  One damaged child to another, so to speak.  The fact that Sunny seeks the help of Susan Silverman, ace detective Spencer's significant other, is a nice bonus.  Presumably, Parker is building Sunny up to some future interaction with the man himself.  I'm looking forward to it.	2004-10-08

Stephanie still has her moments of madcap zaniness, but Evanovich seems to have decided to clean up her protagonist's act.  Stephanie, it is still made clear, is not the best bounty hunter around (that would be Ranger), but she isn't the worst either.  She actually seems like she knows what she's doing.  She witnesses a crime, takes appropriate action and can accurately describe the get away vehicle and perpetrator to the cops.  She knows how to handle herself in a tight spot. She's no longer a joke, and personally, I like her a lot better this way.  The relationships still vacillate between Ranger and Morelli, and I suppose the author will milk this for as long as she can, but the series is taking a new, and far more entertaining direction.	2004-07-09

Their characters had become boring.  They fought a villain and went back to their static, unchanging lives.  People like heroes they can relate to, who share at least some of the same problems and concerns as themselves.  Finally, DC started over again, reduced Superman's powers and gave him a life that resembled yours and mine.  A few years ago, on the late lamented tv program, Lois and Clark, Clark said to Lois, &quot;Superman is what I do.  Clark is who I am.&quot;  Superman, unfortunately, is who Jack Reacher is, as well as what he does.  Reminds me of James Bond, Hercule Poirot...even Sherlock Holmes.  Brilliant, superficial.  Jack Reacher has no fear, therefore, we do not fear for him.  He wanders from place to place, righting wrongs, then leaves.  In the end, the reader wants a protagonist to get something out of his adventures--chance, moral growth, something.  The book works pretty well on the plot level, thought even here, it's pretty over the top.  But in the end, it's boring.  If Jack Reacher doesn't care about Jack Reacher, how can I?	2004-06-30

It is well known that he once worked for Christopher Tolkien, but I seem to recall reading that he once worked for Dorothy Dunnett as well, though my memory may have played me false in this.  I know, however, that Kay has stated his admiration for her works and has dedicated a poem to her.  Dorothy Dunnett, author of The Lymond Chronicles and the House of Niccolo series, has been described as the greatest living historical novelist (though she is now deceased).  Her strengths mirror Kay's, as does her most greates weakness: a penchant for melodrama.  In Kay, this was more conspicuous in the Lions of A-Rassan and the Fionovar Tapestry.  The Last Light of the Sun is a bit less lyrical than his previous works, the language more direct, but the writing is still excellent, and the melodrama is kept to a minimum.  The plot moves along with hardly a wasted word.  I disagree strongly with the comments of other reviewers that the numerous side-stories of minor characters were boring.  They added considerably to the feel of the age, the long, dark, muted climb of the Middle Ages back up toward civilization. Guy Gavriel Kay is our greatest living historical fantasist.  All of his books have been excellent.  This is one of his best.	2004-06-21

The plot is also a bit predictable, sort of like Lucas Davenport's life.  In the end, most series turn into a lovefest between the reader and the characters.  Lucas is no longer the wild man of earlier volumes.  He's settled, middle-aged and happy, but the dialogue still crackles and the characters are like old friends, no longer full of surprises but still pretty interesting.  I give it four stars and look forward to the next in this consistently excellent series.	2004-05-24

Real life has no discernible ebb and flow.  Things just happen, and these things rarely make sense.  Fiction has to make sense, and plot is inherently unrealistic.  But let us not forget that the real is usually boring, and boring books do not rise to the top of the best seller lists.  Cassie Claiborne is an intriguing heroine, but this book is boring.  Too real?  Maybe, but certainly there are too many words wrapped around too few incidents, and long drawn descriptions of people, places and things, descriptions that have little to do with the story.  The story is interesting enough, but it could have been told in no more than half of this already thin volume.	2004-02-16

I've read most of the jokes in earlier books, and I found myself skipping ahead, just to get to something new.  So ok, her relationship with Ranger is finally getting somewhere, but as Ranger himself says, there's not much future in a relationship with Ranger.  I suspect we're just marking time here.  And what's with Stephanie and Morelli?  Stephanie says that she just can't be what Morelli wants...oh, really?  At one point Grandma Mazur says that Stephanie (and her young niece who thinks she's a horse) are \\"like her,\\" meaning they have imagination, they don't fit in with mundane humanity.  Now let's see...Stephanie is a bounty hunter, but she makes no effort to become a really good bounty hunter.  She was in the bottom 2% of her college class and has no academic ambitions.  She's not trying to become a businesswoman or learn a trade or open a restaurant.  I have a pretty good idea of what Stephanie isn't, but no idea at all of what she wants out of her life.  I suspect that in the end, when the series has been milked for all it has left, that she'll want Morelli, and that seems just fine to me.	2003-08-08

Anne Rice, Laurell K. Hamilton, even Karen Taylor.  Now Charlaine Harris.  What is it about vampires?  Lestat is a compelling character...tragic grandeur, moral ambiguity, the restless soul striving for the light and falling back into evil.  At its best, truly great stuff.  Anita Blake is the attraction in the Hamilton books.  Tough as nails, deadly, doing her best to do good.  I used to root for Richard over Jean-Claude, not only because Jean-Claude was an arrogant cuss, but because I personally like the idea of happy ever after, and to me this has always meant a family, kids, the whole American dream schtick.  The family options are pretty limited when your significant other is a vampire.  Richard, of course, has turned into a jerk, and Jean-Claude seems like a nicer guy than he used to be.  Now we have Sookie Stackhouse.  Beautiful, spunky, feminine, loyal, an attractive heroine.  You can't help rooting for Sookie, but where are these books going?  Sookie, though telepathic, does not possess the supernatural abilities of Anita Blake, nor her basically bloodthirsty nature.  Sookie is no match for a vampire, except perhaps, at the game of love, which she does not wish to play.  Bill doesn't deserve her, not after the way he treats her in Club Dead.  Eric is a hunk, but so what?  No future with Eric, that's for sure.  I vote for Alcide, a nice, nearly normal werewolf.  I do like this series, though, and I'm looking forward to the next one.	2003-07-15

Darker, deeper, more disturbing, nary a joke nor a one-liner in the entire novel.  I can't say I'm altogether pleased.  This book, quite frankly, is not as much fun as the first few in the series, but still, it works very well.  Lucy says to Elvis that, &quot;These things don't happen to normal people.&quot;  Of course, she's right.  The reader has the option of accepting that Elvis and Joe are entirely not normal, or else concluding that the plots are contrived and unrealistic.  I'm willing to go with the former.  A writer as good as Crais deserves some poetic license, and I'm looking forward to many more volumes of Elvis and Joe in the not too distant future.	2003-03-09

It has it's weaknesses--the section on technical analysis is inadequate, and the numerous signs by which one can supposedly tell when a stock is topping out are simply too vague to be be followed.  Nevertheless, the system does work. Though retrospective (and therefore subject to the charge of data mining), O'Neil's 40 year database has identified numerous factors associated with stocks that are likely to go up.  James O'Shaughnessy, in What Works on Wall Street, has performed a similar study, and has found roughly similar results, the main difference between the two being that O'Shaugnessy's data supports the idea that a low p/e stock is more likely to be successful, while O'Neil discounts the influence of p/e.  No matter.  Both have confirmed that a stock that has been going up is likely to continue going up.  Relative strength counts.  In addition, O'Neil's insistence on cutting your losses while they are still small is perhaps the single most important lesson an aspiring millionaire can learn.  About two years ago, I was telling a colleague of mine that I felt lucky to have sold Cisco, Juniper and Sun for small losses.  His comment was an amazed, \\"You mean you locked in a loss?\\"  A few days ago, I made a similar comment to him, figuring that he had probably forgotten our earlier discussion.  This time, he listened attentively, smiled sadly, and nodded.  The many Amazon reviews which regard the book as an advertisement for Investor's Business Daily do have a point.  However, there are many free search engines (stockpoint.com, marketguide.com) with which one can identify stocks satisfying the CANSLIM criteria.  Similarly, there are a number of free online charting sites (clearstation.com, bigcharts.com) which give much of the same information as O'Neil's proprietary charting service.  I've lost money the past few years, but I haven't lost much, thanks to the fact that I've beenmostly in cash, which puts me way ahead of most professionals.  William O'Neil gives very, very good advice.	2003-02-17

I used to love this series, but in the past few books, it's grown more outlandish, improbable and repetitive.  The plot is absolutely predictable, and the author has seemingly decided that he has to keep good old Doc Ford the same from book to book.  A lot of writers have made the same mistake (Jeremiah Healy, Sue Grafton...).  Contrast this with the way John Sandford or Robert Crais keep their characters fresh--by having them grow, change and develop.  What this means for Doc Ford is that anybody who might represent a love interest has to either leave him, be revealed as a lesbian, or die.  In addition, the dialogue in this one is so sappy and overly sentimental that I winced when reading it.  I hope that Randy Wayne White gets back to the tight plotting of the first few books of the series.	2002-07-05

Clara Rinker is a terrific adversary, screwed up, deadly, but with enough human sensitivity to make the reader feel a lot of sympathy.  For most of the book, I was rooting for her to get away with it.  The plot is clever and generally makes sense, though I don't think the real FBI would allow themselves to be shown up so consistently by a bunch of ex-cops roaming around their former beat.  Sandford has, with a few exceptions, held the reader's interest in the series, by having Davenport grow older and grow up.  In this one, Davenport is about to get married, his fiancee is pregnant, and he's on the verge of starting a new job.  So many other series start out with a bang but quickly descend into formula and routine.  John Sandford shows them how them all how it ought to be done.	2002-06-19

She's still sleeping with all her men and still not pregnant.  I may be wrong, but this series does seem to have an inescapable inevitability about it.  There will be high drama, daring escapes, passionate love scenes, delayed redemption, and finally, Merry will be pregnant, have babies and become Queen.  Prince Cel will either be dead or bound to an eternity of damnation.  All the other issues pale: will the Seelie and Unseelie Court become one?  Will Faerie rule the Earth?

Her last few have certainly lacked the wild originality and imagination of her earlier novels.  Violin and Servant of the Bones were awful,  Memnoch the Devil, Lasher and Taltos, ridiculous, Armand, repetitive and boring.  Merrick is a good book, probably because it's a smaller book.  Less time to play around with the grand IDEAS.  It has characters instead of caricatures, themes that speak for themselves.  It's a novel, not a diatribe.  Merrick Mayfair is an attractive character, David Talbott, an attractive hero.  His fears and regrets are reasonable.  The plot is solid. I had determined quite a while ago that I would stop buying Anne Rice in hardcover, and I haven't yet picked up Blood and Gold, but after this, I'm hopeful...	2002-04-26

He found a formula and he's sticking to it.  It's a pretty good formula, but by now, the reader knows how it's supposed to go.  Not a lot of suspense but the mystery is a reasonable one, hinging on the stupidity of the defendent in the case, Mary Smith, and it's a little less predictable than Parker's last few. Hawk is there, so is Martin Quirk, displaying some blatant police brutality, which I don't think we've seen before.  Susan, of course.  Pearl, the wonder dog...my biggest problem with this one is the dialogue.  Parker used to write snappy, dead on prose.  Here, the conversations are stilted, the observations trite.  Real people don't talk like this...but I've stuck with Parker for a lot of years, and it's going to take more than this one to make me stop reading him.  I think from now on, however, I'm going to wait for the paperback.	2002-04-10
US	52836875	R1607AD4RLZRKG	0743421914	549137614	Look to Windward	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Tentative	I get the feeling that Banks is beginning to doubt himself, which is too bad.  I was at the WorldCon in Philadelphia last year and attended a panel discussion where Banks and his works figured prominently.  Much of the discussion centered around the (supposedly) left-wing nature of Bank's utopian Culture.  One of the panelists stated that in Look to Windward, Banks was attempting to respond to his critics.  Maybe so.  It seems to me, however, that left-wing/right-wing is missing the mark.  The Marxist/Capitalist debate centers around the best way to divide the pie, but when the pie is infinite and everybody has absolutely everything (in a material sense, at least) that they can possibly want, then such questions become moot. In any case, this book does give a darker picture of the Culture.  Major Quilan, a canine like alien, has accepted a suicide mission to destroy the Masaq Orbital, in revenge for the Culture's interference in his own civilization's brutal civil wars.  Quilan doesn't really care about the issues.  He's just depressed and the idea of a suicide mission appeals to him.  The Culture, in this book, is not quite the all-powerful political entity that has been pictured in past books.  It appears, in fact, to hang somewhere between youthful exuberance and jaded middle age.  Other civilizations have reached the same point and \\"Sublimed,\\" or somehow vanished into a higher (or at least different) dimension of existence.  The Culture makes mistakes, no doubt about it.  The Culture has a lot to feel guilty about.  But the Culture is what it is, a deliberate attempt to provide the ultimate in material well being and personal freedom to the maximum number of people, and I, along with (I am fairly certain) virtually every other reader, would sure like to live there.	2002-02-05

They need blood but generally take only a pint or so.  They seem to rarely kill their victims and aside from having to avoid daylight and not aging, lead pretty normal lives.  This is not a bad book. It's well-written and the lead character, Vivienne Courbet, is beautiful, spunky and impulsive (almost, but not quite, to the point of being stupid).  The plot is thin.  We follow Vivienne from her work (which she apparently loves) as a high priced prostitute in 18th Century Paris, to her conversion by Max, through the French Revolution, to modern day New York.  Not a lot of surprises in this one.  The villain is pretty obvious, the resolution pat.  Moderately entertaining fluff, but I've read worse.	2002-02-05
US	52836875	RPAYGDXJMQ7I3	0312861028	613572052	Psychohistorical Crisis	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Distinctive	Some years ago, the Foundation Trilogy won an honorary Hugo as the best science fiction series ever.  I've always doubted that it deserved that singular honor, but I cannot deny the billiance of Asimov's concept nor the wide-ranging impact of his work.  Where Asimov fell down was on characterization, and his style, while adequate, was hardly beautiful.  I have often thought that Asimov, one of the most prolific writers in history, would have been a better writer if he had written a little less and polished a little more.  Kingsbury's style is better than Asimov's, and has written a book that is (for me, at any rate) far more engrossing in the same Psychohistorical Universe.  Kingsbury's books (sadly, all too few of them, only 3 original novels plus 2 short knockoffs in Larry Niven's War Against the Kzin series) almost burst with creative, marvelous asides.  This is a wonderful story, and if it occasionally lags a bit, or gets bogged down in complex descriptions of mathematics that do not, in fact, exist, these are minor quibbles.  And frankly, such sections can be skimmed over without harming the reader's appreciation of the story.  Eron Osa is an attractive, sympathetic protagonist.  His situation, &quot;execution&quot; for publishing secrets that the Psychohistorical bureaucracy does not wish revealed, might seem too esoteric in the hands of a less talented author than Kingsbury, but here resonates perfectly.  All in all, highly recommended.	2002-01-14

Burke is a fully realized character, but he's a static character.  There has never been a lot of change, and certainly not a lot of growth in Burke.  Each book is much like the last: a mystery, almost always involving violent child abuse, driven by a really horrifying villain.  This one is a weaker than most.  The villain isn't much of a villain, his only real &quot;crimes&quot; being stupidity, arrogance, and the betrayal of his friends many years before.  I have to admit, I'm getting tired of Burke.  He's brilliant, but he's so sanctimonious.  He pretends to himself that he doesn't have a lot of morals, but in a lot of ways he's a prude.  He looks down on damn near everybody and his jaded, cynical opinions of just about everything are becoming a real turn-off.  Don't get me wrong.  Second rate Vachss is still worth reading, but you'd be better off with Blossom, or maybe Footsteps of the Hawk.	2001-11-24

There is, so far as I can see, only one thing to quibble about.  In the land of Terre d'Ange, the ruling commandment is to &quot;love as thou wilt.&quot;  The principal deity of this land, Naamah, sold herself to any who wanted her.  The heroine of the book, Phedre, was brought up, first in the Night Court, then by aristocratic Anafiel Delaunay, to be a cultured and highly skilled courtesan.  Such courtesans are highly prized, acting as both servants and incarnations of the deity.  Yet every now and then, a disparaging comment is made about &quot;whores.&quot;  Yet this is, in the end, only a quibble, and hardly detracts from what is, all-in-all, a superb first novel.	2001-11-14

What more could one ask for? Well, just a little more than this. I, for one (and I've said this in previous reviews of Parker's books) am totally tired of heros who love their women so much that they drive the women into the arms of other men. Let's see...Love and Glory, All my Yesterdays, Spencer (of course), the Sunny Randall novels, and now Jesse Stone. The same damn, dumb thing. Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. Oh, well...it's still a good book, but I really wish Parker would figure out a new schtick for his protagonists' love lives. This one is a bore.	2001-10-20

Much of the action in this one is internal, concerning Anita and her numerous relationships.  But that's just fine with me.  Hamilton has made a habit of delaying emotional (and sexual) resolutions, drawing out the suspense from book to book.  This one finally delivers.  I have two quibbles.  First, despite the awful difficulties that Anita perpetually encounters, she usually winds up (and this book is no exception) in solving her problems through a certain amount of serendipity.  In book after book, she's caught in the bad guy's lair, seemingly at his mercy, when a new power suddenly wells up within her and she carves out the bad guy's heart.  Way to go, Anita.  But in the end, it seems contrived and just a little too easy.  My other quibble concerns Anita's lack of internal struggle.  For at least five books now, she's been wrestling with her needs, desires and compulsions.  At one point in this book, Anita tells Jean-Claude that she doesn't want to turn into &quot;slut-girl.&quot;  But the definition of slut-girl has changed considerably.  In earlier books, the basically uptight Anita would have regarded having sex with a man to whom she was not engaged--or at least in love--as beyond the pale.  In this one, slut-girl means participating in a gang-bang with strangers.  Gang bangs with friends bother her only a little, and are pretty much okay.  While the compulsions of her magic might make the  sex inevitable, I think a bit more soul-searching and hand-wringing would have been more in character.  Nevertheless, this book has the typical Hamilton energy.  It's one damn thing after another, and the reader is taken for a wild ride.  Like most of her fans, I'm already looking forward to the next one.	2001-10-20

This particular book has a lot of pre-story, but the reviewers who feel that it needs a prequel are wrong.  The author works in the background in such a way that the salient points are obvious, and while they might indeed have made an entertaining story on their own, such a story is by no means necessary to understand and appreciate this one.  The only real problem here is that the action is repetitive, therefore tedious.  Fewer fights (or shorter fights) and more characterization would have been appreciated.  Nevertheless, I liked this story very much.  It doesn't need a prequel, but it sure could use a sequel!	2001-06-28

Hannibal Lecter has been transformed into Armand, with his small size, small, even teeth, enormous strength, air of attentive stillness and unnaturally acute senses.   Even his age.  He acts like--and seems to be depicted as--a young man, but  he was born in 1938 and this makes him just a little long in the tooth for  this sort of stuff.  Harris confirms this impression when he states that  cannibals are nomadic but vampires are territorial.  Hannibal Lecter is  territorial.  The book, therefore, is in part a fantasy, and presumably  this was the author's intent.  While entertaining, it doesn't really work.   In a fantasy, magic prevails and anything can happen.  Most of the other  reviewers do not like the ending.  I share their opinion.  Clarice is  (magically) mesmerized by the vampire and comes to share his world.  I  don't buy it.  In addition, the FBI segments are ridiculous.  It has become  a convention that government bureaucracies are inherently stupid but these  people are too stupid for belief.  Everybody who is pure in soul (and some  who aren't) knows that Paul Krendler is vicious, venal and stupid.  It  seems more than unlikely that he would have risen as high as he has in any  organization resembling a meritocracy.  In addition, the way that the  organization was willing to throw Starling to the dogs, for reasons that  make little sense, was a convenient plot device but a total cop-out.  That  being said, it's still one of the more entertaining books that I've  recently read.  Too bad it wasn't better.	1999-07-22

Their preoccupations, particularly those of the narrator, are superficial and narcissistic.  These are people who not only cannot relate to other people, they are  people to whom other people barely exist.  Each of them wanders through his  solipsistic world, seeing, never connecting.  Bateman can only exist  emotionally when he is torturing, but the isolation of the city and the  times is such that his crimes sink without a splash.  The book is, in a  sense, a satire, and satire is a form with inherent limitations.  Satire  does not take its people seriously.  How then, can we?	1999-03-10

Both have a similar, brooding intensity.  Both are well-written, with realistic, engaging dialogue and characters that sweep  the reader up in their problems.  This book, however, seemed a bit sketchy.   For instance, the degeneration of Rachel's relationship with Mitchell  Geary was told rather than shown.  We never quite see what the problem is,  other than Rachel's having difficulty with the fact that people are rarely  so perfect as their dreams would have them.  Galilee was sketchily drawn.   It is stated near the end that his only obligation to the Geary's was to be  the solacing (and servicing) of their women.  Why then, does he kill  Mitchell's father?  It is implied that he is somehow compelled by a promise  to Cadmus' ancestor, but why should such a promise induce him to do what he  finds to be revoltingly wrong?  There is no reason to think that he is  bound, as Pie-Oh-Pah was bound in Imajica, to the service of an unwise  master.  And what of the fact that he has been released from the promise by  the first Geary woman that he has loved?  And why the sado-masochistic  nature of his further relationships with the Geary women?  All-in-all, I  found the narrator, Maddox, and his sisters to be the most engrossing  characters in the book, far more complex than the eponymous Galilee.  I do  look forward to the sequel, and I hope that the loose ends are tied up.	1998-12-28

I've been a fan of Randy Wayne White since I read Sanibel Flats and have eagerly anticipated every new book.  The only unsuccessful book in the series was The Man Who Invented Florida, written in a Carl Hiaassen,  Laurence Shames comedic style that never quite rang true.  Mr. White has a  superb prose style, both elegant and evocative.  The characters are well  rounded and sympathetic, the dialogue riveting.  The references of other  reviewers that Doc Ford is a sort of poor-man's Travis McGee, in my  opinion, misses the mark.  Ford is a far more complex character than Travis  McGee, and the plots of the Doc Ford novels are far less formulaic.  Every  Travis McGee novel seemed to pit the hero against a man who, basically, was  both tougher and smarter than McGee.  Travis McGee always seemed to win out  with a large helping of serendipity.  The Mangrove Coast immediately grabs  the reader and doesn't let go until the very end.  Highly recommended.	1998-11-25

To wit, a protagonist, for whom the reader feels sympathy, has a problem.  The protagonist's attempts to solve the problem come to nothing, usually making the problem even worse.  Finally, when all seems lost, the protagonist solves his problem.  <br />Ed McBain has been doing it for forty years, and very few have done it as well.  Ed McBain knows all about the plot skeleton.  In this book, he deliberately ignores the convention.  There is no protagonist, instead, a lonely group of people, tied together by nothing except proximity, must attempt to stop a plot designed to involve the U.S. in a major war.  Every time you think you've identified a character who might turn into a protagonist, he or she gets killed, and the bad guys wander on their merry way, unimpeded.  Finally, when all seems lost, the bad guys lose-- by pure serendipity.  McBain is playing with his readers here, and the readers have the right to resent it.  The book is a political commentary, not a novel, and as such, it's overdone and heavy handed.  By far the most disappointing McBain that I've read (and I've read most of them).	1998-07-05

All-in-all, an excellent book, well-written, snappy dialogue, well-rounded characters whose motivations make sense.  This is the first book in the series that I've read, so I came to it with no preconceptions.  A number of other reviewers seem to feel disappointed that so much time was spent on the relationships, but a book whose people aren't people is always a bore in the end.  The relationships are what made the book work.  I will admit to some disappointment at Anita's choice of Jean-Claude over Richard.  For one thing, Jean-Claude has gotten every woman he ever wanted for over two hundred years, and he's obviously wanted plenty.  He doesn't deserve this one.  Richard is not a wimp because he prefers peace, light and harmony to bloodlust and murder.  He loses Anita (if he's lost her) because he did exactly what she wanted him to do.  He faced his enemy, killed him and then dealt with the consequences of that decision.  Anita is the one who couldn't face those consequences.  In this context, her choice of Jean-Claude was an act of cowardice.  She wasn't running to Jean-Claude, she was running from herself.  Nevertheless, a very good book.  Considering what happened here, I'm not going to read the earlier ones, since I know how it all turns out, but I will certainly tune in for the next one.	1998-04-15

Dorothy Dunnett has been described as the greatest living historical novelist.  Maybe she used to be.  The author has always had a penchant for melodrama, a penchant which marred her earlier series, the Lymond Chronicles...but this book has gone seriously around the bend.  Ms. Dunnett has a forceful prose style, a sure ear for dialogue, a keen descriptive eye and a masterly handle on her characterizations.  Her plots are another matter.  In To Lie with Lions, the hero, Nicholas de Fleury, survives (purely by luck) at least three separate attempts on his life.  His wife and toddler son survive similar attacks, and, again purely by fortuity, Gelis barely escapes seduction by the King of Scotland in a medieval hot-tub (but hey, what's a little serendipity among friends).  If all this weren't enough, it seems that Gelis, after having slept with Nicholas' father, after having claimed that Nicholas' son was not his, after having become an agent for his enemies and having conspired for his total financial ruin, was not doing all of this (as had earlier been claimed) for retribution in the belief that Nicholas had seduced and betrayed her sister.  No...now it is revealed that Gelis actually felt inferior to her sister and did not think that she could keep Nicholas' love and interest unless she showed him that she was smarter than he was (a real genius, this girl).  And then, after betraying the poor lovestruck lunatic in every way possible, she decides that Nicholas is the one who's gone too far (!) because he bankrupt the treasury of Scotland (and incidentally won their little game).  She then goes off in a huff to cherish her moral superiority (I bet that'll show him).  I've got to admit, I'll probably read the next one, but after this, I don't much care.	1998-01-20
