In her book and in her speech, she does a wonderful job of explaining how it feels to have Bipolar Disorder.  Her descriptions and guidance make it much easier to understand why this disorder generates such wonders and tragedies.  I highly recommend her work to people who have Bipolar Disorder and their family members.   <br /> <br />Sheryl Gurrentz, author <br />If Your Child is Bipolar	2005-03-19

This book gave me ideas about how to promote my books, how to help organizations promote internal change by using the right people to spread the word, and even how to better understand the social pressures my teenager faces.  This well-written book constantly encourages the reader to think, but don't let the extensive endnotes and index fool you--it also is easy, fun and enjoyable to read.  I am going to recommend it to lots of different groups--a Temple that after 38 years is about to transition to a new rabbi, a financial services company that is making a major internal and external transition, and a small publishing company that has to rely heavily on word-of-mouth.  This book has certainly already reaching its tipping point in the market, and I wouldn't consider myself a connector, maven,or salesperson, but I certainly want to help spread the word about this great book. <br /> <br />Sheryl Gurrentz, author <br />\\"If Your Child is Bipolar\\" <br />\\"The Guilt-Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom\\"	2005-03-11

It helped me understand the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of my family member who is an addict and who has been in an in-patient rehab center in a way that I never thought would be possible. It also helped me understand how those in rehab can perceive and react to loving family members who want to visit, help, and make things better.  I'm sure that family members of addicts and addicts will not be the only ones to appreciate this great book.  Book clubs and the general reader will also love this book because it is so well-written, creatively formatted to match the tone, brutal in its honesty, and written by someone with incredible strength of character.  <br /> <br />Sheryl Gurrentz, Author <br />\\"If Your Child is Bipolar\\" <br />\\"The Guilt Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom\\"	2004-12-29

This wonderfully written story of Chicago before and during the World's Fair reads like a novel, even though it's a well-researched historical account.  Even those with no connection to the city of Chicago will enjoy reading about how the city represented the American energy, idealism, entrepreneurialism, and enthusiasm during a time in American history that our history courses tend to overlook.  I highly recommend this book to casual readers, lovers of historical novels, and bookclubs who want an interesting discussion about how society, invention, economics and psychology combine to make an incredible story that represents so much about America during the late 1800's and early 1900's!  <br /> <br />Sheryl Gurrentz, author of \\"If Your Child is Bipolar\\" and \\"The Guilt Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom\\"	2004-12-27

Unfortunately, while it is interesting to read one person's perspective, this book doesn't provide any guidance or information that can help other parents handle similar situations without alienating their children, getting divorced, or feeling totally powerless against the medical community.  The author, who researches and writes articles for a national news magazine, doesn't even mention--maybe he didn't take the time to do research regarding his children's disorders--that as a biologically-based mental illness, Bipolar Disorder receives the same level of insurance coverage as any other medical condition.  That one piece of information alone could have helped him and other readers have an easier time finding appropriate treatment.  If parents want to wallow in the disturbing experiences of other parents of mentally ill children, this is a good book.  If they want a resource that can help them use appropriate parenting techniques for mentally ill children. take care of themselves and their marriages, and obtain successful treatment, there are other, better books. <br /> <br />Sheryl Gurrentz, author <br />\\"If Your Child is Bipolar:  A Parent-to-Parent Guide to Living With and Loving a Bipolar Child\\" <br />\\"The Guilt-Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom\\"	2004-11-28

Child: 50 Ways Improve your Child's Behavior attn Span w/o Drugs Labels or Coercion	Books	1	31	101	N	N	The Reality of Intolerance	No parent wants their child to have a brain disorder of any kind.  No parent wants to label their child.  To think that ADD is a myth is ridiculous.  Parents with raging, violent, inattentive, and difficult children deserve support.  Yes, there are cases when ADD is misdiagnosed, but that doesn't make ADD a myth.  In fact, more and more research is showing that ADD might actually be an early sign of something else, such as Bipolar Disorder, which this author probably doesn't believe in either!  Parents--if you think your child needs help, find supportive guidance.  If you choose not to put your child on medication, that's fine, but use resources that don't criticize parents who do. <br /> <br />Sheryl Gurrentz, Co-author of \\"If Your Child is Bipolar: A Parent-to-Parent Guide to Living With and Loving a Bipolar Child\\"	2004-09-24
