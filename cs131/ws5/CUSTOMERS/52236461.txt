Another nice touch is the fact that Narramore never mentions a single minister by name; instead, he concentrates on the subject matter. He doesn't attack his fellow christian.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, you will recognize who is teaching some of the errors covered in this book because the author accurately covers the topic but he does so with love, accuracy, and succinctness. The book is available for free at the publisher's web site but you'll want to get a print version for off line use.<br /><br />Highly recommended--I even ordered two copies!	2005-09-25

However, the steps outlined seem to coincide with Hagin's experience at times rather than the Word. Not to say that it isn't Word-based but there are some things that seem to be based more on his ministry experience.<br /><br />For instance, Hagin states that if you pray for the infilling and do not \\"sense\\" anything moving upon you, you have a lack of faith. And if you do \\"sense\\" something but do not yield, it is a lack of yielding.<br /><br />First, the Holy Spirit is received by faith not by a \\"sensing\\". The book of Acts makes no statement that proves the veracity of Hagin's claim. Second, if a person doesn't speak forth, it doesn't necessarily mean that they did not receive; it only means that they did not cooperate due to fear or lack of instruction.<br /><br />I know many readers hold to the \\"initial evidence\\" to such an extent that they feel that unless you speak in tongues, you weren't filled. But I would suggest a little thought and meditation along this line to my friends.<br /><br />Since we receive by faith, and since it is our job to speak (the Holy Spirit will not do it for us) it is possible for God to do His part and for us to fail to do our part. Don't get me wrong, tongues were the evidence in Acts to prove to the Apostles one had received but they used this as a gauge since they couldn't see nor hear the Spirit without some manifestation. And it was also the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy--\\"This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.\\"<br /><br />However, it is possible for one to be filled and yet not speak in tongues for a variety of reasons. Some of the Bible teachers who believe this are: Jay Snell, Kenneth Copeland, Andrew Wommack, and Dave Roberson, among others.<br /><br />Otherwise, a good book for outlining the basic steps.	2004-08-27

Hagin has written a much-needed corrective for those of us who believe in God wanting us to prosper.<br /><br />For years, \\"prosperity\\" has been a revolution to some and a revulsion to others. And though it is God's will for His children to be taken care of, too many contemporary teachers have taken the subject to unbiblical extremes.<br /><br />Hagin leaves no stone unturned as he scripturally lays a foundation and corrects a lot of the current teaching that has become extreme such as:<br /><br />* Giving to get<br /><br />* The 100 fold return<br /><br />* Giving to the poor<br /><br />* Sowing and Reaping<br /><br />* Firstfruit giving<br /><br />And more...<br /><br />The reality is that Hagin wrote this book to his sons in the faith trying to bring them back into balance in this area. Unfortunately, according to some reports that I have heard, Hagin's sons in the faith have largely rejected his timely message.<br /><br />It's kind of ironic that the very ministers who got their start with this man of faith have now rejected his corrective in the area of finances--determined to carry on with unscriptural practices and gimmicks.<br /><br />I am glad that I took the time to read this book. And though I have never \\"gone overboard\\" with prosperity, Hagin's book was a confirmation of some of the conclusions that I have come to in recent years.<br /><br />I just wish Hagin's spiritual sons would follow his lead and come back into balance. But when you start to touch the money, the fur begins to fly, I guess.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-08-23

Creflo Dollar has written a book praising the importance of the tithe; however, I believe that the level to which he raises the tithe is biblically inaccurate.<br /><br />Ministers have taught about the tithe for years and its importance for the spiritual well-being of the church at large. Dollar takes this one step further and makes the tithe, which is one of many subjects in the Bible, THE subject.<br /><br />Problematic is the title itself. Tithing couldn't be the \\"covenant connector\\" when it was FAITH that justified Abraham--not tithing.<br /><br />Secondly, we who are Gentile believers were never under the Law to begin with so how can a New testament, Blood-bought child of the Living God, filled with His Spirit and righteousness be cursed for failing to do something that wasn't even written to them --at least directly?<br /><br />Finally, Creflo states that we won't even be healed if we don't tithe. This isn't surprising seeing that he makes tithing the doorway into all of the promises of God. Tithing may be a principle but we must never make it THE vehicle through which God blesses us. It is always through faith in what He has already done that brings the fulfillment of the promise--NOT the giving of a certain percentage of money into the local church.<br /><br />Creflo makes a distinction by saying that tithing is not a money issue but a covenant issue. But Abraham was blessed and had the promise of God BEFORE he ever tithed. And the tithe that is recorded is the only one Abraham ever gave according to the Biblical record. And even then, Abraham tithed off of the spoils of war and not off of his personal income.<br /><br />I believe that Dollar has a faulty major premise in making tithing the central focus when Jesus didn't even make it a central focus.<br /><br />When Jesus told the scribes and pharisees that they should tithe and do what the Law commanded, He made an interesting statement to them. Jesus said that these Jewish men had focused on tithing even of their spices yet they where omitting thw WEIGHTIER matters of the Law: Justice, Mercy, etc. By implication, Jesus Himself was saying that tithing was not as weighty as some of the other demands that the Law had placed on them. So how can we make tithing \\"The Covenant Connector\\" when Jesus never considered it so?<br /><br />The first time I heard this preached by Creflo, a red flag went up in my spirit as to the incorrectness of the teaching.<br /><br />Tithing has a place in principle--but not in a legalistic way and certainly not as THE thing that connects us to the Covenant. Only faith is the Connector--NOT tithing.<br /><br />To make the promises hinge on what I do or don't do with my money is to make the biblical promises subject to Mammon which they are not.<br /><br />In the end, Creflo is probably sincere but is wrong when examined in light of the rest of the Word of God. Hence, a low rating.of their spices yet they where omitting thw WEIGHTIER matters of the Law: Justice, Mercy, etc. By implication, Jesus Himself was saying that tithing was not as weighty as some of the other demands that the Law had placed on them.

The author really hit on some of the ideas and viewpoints that I came to some time ago about the subject of tithing.<br />The book demonstrates that there are several passages in scripture that are seldom, if ever, dealt with in the modern church. For instance, scriptures dealing with \\"redeeming\\" the tithe, eating the tithe and having a party with the tithe (never hear that taught today), where the tithes were brought, for whom,  and for what reason the tithes were collected.<br />The author discusses the scriptures which deal with the tithing ritual and command and shows how using them and applying them to a New Testament believer presents all kinds of problems because it is a misapplication to do so.<br />The author appears to be a former \\"Word of faith\\" individual and although he has friends and knows pastors that are still devoted to word/faith teachings, he takes a strident tone with word/faith teachers accusing them of \\"begging\\" for money and tithes.<br />I would not go so far as to say that the ministers whom he mentions \\"beg\\" for money per se, but he does make his point about the emphasis on tithing which is prevelant in the church--both brick and mortar and electronic.<br />A good solid book on a major issue in the body of Christ today and highly recommended.	2004-01-22

This is important. The Calvinist makes his claims and bases his theology on a deductive reasoning of the scriptures instead of letting the scriptures speak for themselves within their context.<br /><br />Olson lays out his thesis chapter by chapter and builds upon a strong foundation which is buttressed by each additional chapter.<br /><br />His tone is informative--not vitriolic.

It's good to know that you can never lose your salvation once you get it. The contention of Mr. Wilkin is that one momentary expression of belief in Christ is all that is necessary for salvation regardless of future works or the lack thereof.<br />While I do not believe in a maintenance-based salvation model, Wilkin's \\"acquisition\\" of salvation is a little shy of evangelical thought in this area.<br />Wilkin makes no distinction between those who merely assent to the facts of the Gospel and those who take it to heart and believe it because of a heart change. Wilkin just lumps all believing into one pot as it were and concludes that no matter what, if a person just believes the Gospel, they will be saved.<br />Like all books, this has some truth and some partial truth.<br />Believing is much more than a head-knowledge faith. There are many people who know Christ lived and even believe that He died but it makes no difference in their lives--which leads me to my next point.<br />While Jesus said that believing in Him would result in salvation, the scripture also declares that a true believer will bear fruit. If just a mere intellectual belief in Christ were necessary, a lot more people would be saved according to  Wilkin--and I disagree with his exposition of what it means to believe. While one can be fully persuaded as Abraham was, one can also willfully refuse to believe no  matter how many facts are placed in front of them.<br />One other area that was misguided was the use of the Parable of the Sower to prove his point that those who believe for a little while are still saved. The focus of the parable was the Word of God and its ability to produce in the believer's life--not necessarily salvation. I don't think that Wilkin himself believes that some receive 30-fold salvation while others get 60- and 100-fold respectively.<br />He does bring out some good points but in the end, this appears to be a pet doctrine for him and his writing reflects this.	2003-10-30

The author makes his point that tithing is no longer binding upon Christians. But the way he does it is confusing.<br /><br />First, the sum of his position can be put into 50 pages or less. His thesis is relatively small in scope and the book's size is misleading.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is enumerated with small Roman numerals and one thinks they are reading a preface when in actuality, they are reading the \\"meat\\" of his thesis. When the pagination starts with arabic numerals--leading the reader to assume the start of the book proper--the author has finished the bulk of his thesis and adds a bunch of addendums. Needless to say, the way the book was put together is very confusing.<br /><br />And though the author is a very educated man, the grammar used in the book is very poor in syntax and structure--and I am talking basic grammar here. Misprints abound and even whole scripture passages are incorrect because an editor (or grammar checker program) misspelled words and deleted words causing some scripture quotations  to say something completely different than the actual Bible text.<br /><br />Consider the following \\"gem\\"found on page xxxiv in the middle of the page:<br />(Brackets are my emphasis of the most egregious errors; otherwise, all punctuation is exactly as found in the book)<br /><br />(And I quote)<br /><br />\\"For as many as are works of the Law are under the curse for it is written [cured] is everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do, them, but that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God; it is evident for the just shall live by faith, but the man that doeth them shall live by faith. Christ hath redeemed us [for] the curse of the Law; being made a curse for us, for it is written [cursed is everyone through Jesus Christ], that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. Wherefore [who] then serveth the Law?\\"<br /><br />This is enough to warrant a recall. This book should have never gone to press! The mistakes alone detract from the author's credibility and are an affront to any education he may have.<br /><br />I can tolerate a few errors as long as the flow of thought and the main message get through but these grammatical blunders are not only ridiculous, they are serious errors which result in misquotations of the Word of God and should be corrected.<br /><br />The odd order of presentation as well as the grammatical and syntactical errors make this book of low value to most readers.<br /><br />Definitely not recommended.the author's credibility and are an affront to any education he may have.

For this he is to be commended. However, as is the case many times with those who &quot;major&quot; on a narrow topic, Capps seems to misconstrue certain scriptures out of their context in order to make a point.<br />For instance, in Romans 3, Paul asked a question: &quot;Do we then make the law void through faith? God forbid! Rather we establish the law.&quot; Capps had been talking about the Law of Faith which is the &quot;law&quot; of the New Testament and he quotes this verse above. But instead of reading as it is in context, Capps explained that when Paul said we establish the law, Paul was referring to the law of faith. And from the context, anyone can tell that Paul was referring to the OT law. He was stating that through faith, we actually uphold the requirements of the law, not through works.<br />Capps many times is right in what he says but uses the wrong verses to support his thesis and this weakens an otherwise good book.<br />As I said: many times, those who major on a very narrow line of discussion or one topic tend to &quot;see&quot; that topic in every verse and as a result, tend to use verses out of their context to support their premise when the verse in view does not support it at all.<br />All this is not to say that Capps doesn't make valid points. Again, he makes many strong, scriptural points, but the verses he uses to make them sometimes do not support his conclusion and occasionally are bent out of context to get his point across.<br />Hence, three stars.	2003-10-17

Charles Capps has touched upon a very important truth in this book and should be taken to heart by every Christian. Unfortunately, there are always those who do not believe that Jesus said what He meant in MK 11:23.<br />It always amazes me how someone can look you in the eye and tell you flat out that Jesus did not mean what He said in MK 11:23. Another reviewer stated that Jesus was only showing the power of faith in prayer. I agree that Jesus was certainly using an object lesson when referring to speaking to a mountain but if MK 11:23 did not mean exactly what it states, then Jesus' whole argument for faith in prayer falls apart in MK 11:24! It is precisely because of  the truth Jesus expounded upon in MK 11:23  that makes MK 11:24 work! But then again, the pharisees always resented what Jesus said and we still have modern-day &quot;pharisees&quot; who will call you on the carpet any time your brand of theology differs from  their own--which many times is simpy wrong.<br />As far as &quot;name it and claim it&quot; I will be the first to state that  there have been abuses, but as long as what you &quot;name&quot; and &quot;claim&quot; is bounded by the scriptures, you can have it! Jesus promised that! But then again, maybe He didn't say what He meant  like in MK 11:23...right?<br />Also, Jesus Himself stated that we are not to pray to Him: &quot;...in that day, ye shall ask me NOTHING.&quot; So the other reviewer who brings up this aspect of Capp's teaching is either ignorant of scripture or has a doctrinal ax to grind.<br />Lastly,  we do &quot;create&quot; with our words. And God can be bound--not because we are greater than He is but because He has bound Himself to His Word and only operates within the scope and parameters of His Word. This fact gives us the basis for faith for if we never know what God will do in a situation, we would never pray in faith and never get any answers to prayer. How  in the world can you pray in faith (which is confidence) for something when you do not know whether or not God will give you what you asked for? YOU CAN'T!

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Excellent book on the reality of New Testament Giving	Ron Knott has written an excellent book dealing with the question of tithing for New Testament believers. The issue has become somewhat of a sacred cow for many in the church and Knott masterfully lays out his thesis and delves into much scripture to prove his points.<br />if you are committed to tithing and believe it is New testament in its application, you should read this book anyway as there are many more scriptures dealing with tithing than Malachi 3:8-10. In fact, Knott shows that the tithe was NEVER money and further that the tithe was sometimes consumed by the individual.<br />Knott's book does have one peeve with me: he takes Jesus' teaching above giving to the poor and misapplies it to the Born Again believer. Jesus stated in the Gospels that those who do not give to the poor would not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Knott is correct in that this is in the Bible but he fails to apply it in light of the rest of scripture. The ONLY requirement for one to go to heaven is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Period. To make giving to the poor a requisite would violate salvation by grace through faith.<br />Other than this theological oversight, the book is remarkably balanced and tempered in its presentation as Knott does not have an axe to grind. He does make his points however.<br />Good book on christians and tithing and a must-read!	2003-10-09

What most Christians do not know is that if you depend upon the Gospels to give a complete treatise on what happened when Christ died, you will miss out on what happened behind the scenes, so to speak. Because the Pauline revelation was just that: a revelation of what Christ did for us and what He accomplished at the Cross, in the tomb and in His resurrection.<br />It is only through a knowledge of what happened From the Cross to the Throne that the true majesty and glory of Christ can be seen and His substitutional work appreciated.<br />Since this type of teaching is lost on many areas of the institutional Church, it is no wonder that many have assailed the truths contained in this book. People simply do not know what Christ did in total, and to hear something that has been missing from their brand of christianity for so long sounds to them like another &quot;revelation&quot;.<br />In reality, it is Paul's revelation and it is scriptural and the Church needs to be taught in this area for when we know what Christ accomplished, we know what we are capable of doing through HIM.<br />Highly recommended...	2003-08-07

Most Christians fail to receive from God because they do not know that they are in covenant with Him through Jesus Christ.<br />A lack of knowledge has seen people begging and pleading with God to do things for them that He has already promised through the covenant to do and yearns to do for us.<br />This little booklet goes into detail about the covenant: its background, how it was carried out in days of old and its significance today.<br />Highly recommended reading because if you do not know your covenant with God--or even what a covenant is--it can cost you your blessings and in some cases, where healing is concerned, your life.	2003-08-07

His book on healing has been my favorite for it goes into detail about how healing was provided, how it is obtained and obstacles that prevent people from receiving what is rightfully theirs.<br />T.L. Osborn motivates the reader to act on what Jesus already did for us--not sit passively by and wait on God. God has doneHis part. It's up to us to receive and Osborn brings this truth out with much scripture.<br />A &quot;meaty&quot; book, the details give you something to chew on instead of milk to drink.<br />Should be recommended reading for every Christian--especially those who are in need of healing.	2003-08-07

Kenyon's book &quot;Jesus the Healer&quot; has long been a favorite of those who believe in divine healing.<br />He lays out the case for healing simply but in a majestic way. He proves that healing belongs to all of God's children.<br />The only areas where I disagree with Kenyon are his statements that all are sick in spirit before they are sick in body, and that the spirit gets healed first and then the spirit heals the body. Our spirits are &quot;vacuum-packed&quot; and cannot be touched with disease or sin for that matter. So, healing doesn't apply to our spirits for there is no such thing as &quot;spirtual healing&quot; per se. If anything, it is our minds that need to be renewed in order to receive healing.<br />But this is a small point out of all of the good points Kenyon makes and it should be read by all Crhistians--especially those in need of healing.<br />Highly recommended...	2003-08-07

While I do not agree with all Charles Capps has to say, I do believe that he shares some important truths that have long been neglected by the Church.<br />Though any truth may be taken to an extreme, to deny it all together is just as bad if not  detrimental. Is Charles a &quot;name-it-and-claim-it teacher? If by this you mean that we have the authority to name a scriptural promise and &quot;claim&quot; it then yes, Capps is definately in this camp. And we all should be as the scriptures teach that whatever God has provided by his Grace, we can claim by faith. All of the promises are &quot;Yes and A-men&quot; so where specific promises are concerned, you do NOT have to pray and see if God wants you to have what He has already died to give you!<br />Also, a major complaint made in other reviews is that Capps teaches that we are not to pray to Jesus. This is scriptural! Jesus Himself declared that &quot;in that day ye shall ask me nothing...&quot; We are to go directly to God and ask for He is our Father and we are His children. We are to go to the Throne in His name--not pray to Jesus. This is Bible. This is teaching straight from the Master and yet because Capps said it, it's now heresy? Get your theological thumb out of your mouth and grow up!<br />Some of Capp's detractors seem to have a very shallow understanding of what the Bible teaches in  regard to faith and prayer. Some believe in a &quot;No-Fault&quot; religion.<br />They simply pray and if God says yes on that particular day, then fine--the prayer is answered. And if not, Cay sera sera. Either way, it is not the fault of the person praying. NO, this is wrong. Whether or not your prayers are answered depend a whole lot more on you than on God.<br />Lastly, no, we are not God but there are plenty of scriptures that talk about the power of the tongue. To say that Capps is into &quot;heresy&quot; is simply theological pride, ignorance or a combination of both.<br />Critics of this type of message had better be careful to call what God has said &quot;heresy.&quot; I believe most of those who do not understand this type of teaching are better off keeping their mouths and their pens shut until they get a little light on the subject. Otherwise, it is to contribute to your own folly.<br />Finally, while I agree that there can be misuse and abuse of ANY doctrine, to reject a teaching without understanding it is foolish.<br />I highly recommend this book. Read it with your spiritual eyes open and with your Bible.be careful to call what God has said &quot;heresy.&quot; I believe most of those who do not understand this type of teaching are better off keeping their mouths and their pens shut until they get a little light on the subject.

Faith is not believing God can but that He will.<br /><br />This book has helped many receive their healing by acting on the truth found within its pages. One of the biggest truths that I took away was the fact that you cannot have faith for something if you do not know God's will on the matter. Without a knowledge of God's will concerning healing or any other matter, you cannot have confidence. Remember, faith is confidence and trust. These two things will never be found where you are ignorant of God's will!<br /><br />Bosworth goes into great lengths to get this point across and for good reason: it makes the difference as to whether you receive or not.<br /><br />Bosworth goes into lengthy detail about the Old Testament types and shadows showing conclusively that God provided for our bodily healing through His death, burial and resurrection, and that it is His will for us.<br /><br />Some believe in a what I'll call a \\"No-Fault\\" religion.<br /><br />They simply pray for healing and if God says \\"yes\\" on that particular day, then fine--the prayer is answered. And if not, Que Sera, Sera. Either way, it is not the fault of the person praying. No, this is wrong. Whether or not your prayers are answered depend a whole lot more on you than on God. And Bosworth goes into detail about this subject as well.<br /><br />If you or a loved one is in need of healing and you need to know whether or not God wants you well, then get this book!<br /><br />It could make a difference--between your being healed or your continuing in suffering.	2003-07-26

I'm not one who likes to use labels for different segments of Christianity but the so-called Faith Message/Movement has gotten a lot of press over the years. To some it's a revelation; to others, its repulsive. I, for one, agree with a lot of what this teaching says but as with all teaching, sometimes, things get a little extreme or at the very least \\"lop-sided\\" in its presentation.<br />Andrew Wommack has done a masterful job of walking the fine line between Grace and Faith. These represent two big \\"camps\\" in the Body of Christ. To put it simply, either God does whatever He wants without our doing anything or God only does something when we use our faith like a crowbar.<br />Neither is correct by itself. Andrew points out that our faith is very important in receiving from God--it is not a matter of waiting on God. By the same token, Andrew shows that grace is important as well because it is the basis for God's provision.<br />IN summary form, Wommack shows that it's neither totally grace nor totally faith. It is using your faith to appropriate what God has already provided by His grace. And this book brings wonderful balance to this topic.<br />You can't make God do anything. Unfortunately, for many in the faith movement, this seems to be the idea. That God only moves when we use our faith. Truth of the matter is God has already done His part (grace). We must now do our part and receive what He has already provided (faith)<br />A wonderfully balanced presentation, the book can be read from cover to cover in less than an hour. But you'll want to take yout time and absorb all of it!<br />Highly recommended!	2003-07-22

In today's world of business, change is the only constant. Many businesses seem to rely on the tried and true methods of yester-year hoping that the things which worked yesterday will work tomorrow. Those who think this way are in for a rude awakening.<br />A changing marketplace demands business innovation that puts value on serving the customer better than the competition, and delivers shareholder return.<br />The authors of this work contend that the &quot;ultimate competitive advantage&quot; is an ever-evolving business model.<br />By &quot;business model&quot; the authors mean the &quot;who, what, where, when, and how&quot; of how a company goes about satisfying consumer needs. Those who do this better than their competitors will ultimately win, while those who merely fix what was broken yesterday so that it runs today will find themselves out of business.<br />The book delves into what exactly is a business model and how it relates to the customer and the competition. One important fact stood out in the book: to merely change a part of your business practice without adapting to a changing market place and increasing customer satisfaction, will lead to disaster.<br />In other words, it isn't so much a fixing of a problem area as it is constantly observing the market and making those little adjustments to your business model--the way you do things, the overall picture--so that you reduce costs, increase customer service, and provide increasing value to both customer and shareholder.<br />The book abounds with profiles of scores of companies and what they did to adapt their business model to changing times. The book is also replete with many recommendations as to how a bisiness--large or small-- can implement these same strategies to improve their profit picture.<br />In the foreward, it is recommended that if you read only one business book in the next five years, make it this one. And I believe that the writer is right on track. The book has hit the nail on the head in recognizing that the business which makes continual surveys and adjustments to their business model are the ones who are going to survive in this age of the ever-changing marketplace.e head in recognizing that the business which makes continual surveys and adjustments to their business model are the ones who are going to survive in this age of the ever-changing marketplace.	2003-05-08

They are there to add clarity to the passages you are reading by referring you to other scriptures covering the same or a related topic.<br />However, only so much can &quot;squeeze&quot;  into this narrow space--limiting the amount of references.<br />But what if there where a book that specialized, yea verily focused only on scripture references? You'd have a book like The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge.<br />It contains over 500,000 references! And since a basic hermeneutical principle is &quot;scripture interprets scripture,&quot; this is one of the handiest volumes one could own.<br />In fact, it would not be an understatement to say that it is a one-volume library in and of itself. OK, maybe a little over the top, but it is a valuable tool that can and should be used in all study.<br />Also, there is an updated version available by Jerome Smith. If you can spare the extra cash, this updated version contains a lot of good commentary. I heartily recommend this volume.	2002-11-16

For many years, Charismatics have been found wanting with respect to an authoritative systematic theology written from a Charismatic perspective. We have had to \\"borrow\\" the systematic theologies of others like Grudem, Schafer, et al. And this isn't bad in and of itself. But in areas such as pneumology, the current evangelical theology has always differed with the charismatic viewpoint, and has left the charismaric wanting in this and other areas.<br />But not any more.<br />Williams covers each important theological subject in a thorough fashion and provides a complete systematic theology for the Charismatically-inclined as well as for the body of Christ at large.<br />It is nice to see a sound theology advanced by an eminently capable scholar who embraces the charismatic world view.<br />I could not give the book five stars because for all its worth, Williams does not believe that healing is in the atonement--a staple for the charismatic community. But William's viewpoint in this area may be due to his Presbyterian roots.<br />Good book if you want a theology from a charismatic viewpoint.	2002-11-08

This update to the original 1990 NIVEC makes it even better!<br />Better typesetting in the dictionaries are a real boost to the productivity of this volume. Originally, the concordance used the &quot;index lexicon&quot; format where the Greek or Hebrew word was listed followed by the various ways the original word was translated--without any formal definition of the original word. The editors felt that to include a formal &quot;definition&quot; would be misleading since various contexts can change the meaning of a word.<br />According to the editors of the 1990 edition, this lexicon/dictionary format was in and of itself a dictionary since it showed all of the ways in which the word could be translated into English.<br />However, as stated in the introduction to this latest edition, there was an outcry from the public for the Greek/Hebrew dictionaries to mirror more closely the Strong's dictionary in terms of layout and features.<br />In response to this, the dictionaries now have &quot;beefed&quot; up definitions as well as the original index of English words used to translate the original word (along with their frequency count).<br />Now, we users of this concordance have the best of both worlds: the familiarity of Strong's layout with the power of Young's analytical layout. Although the concordance followed Young's layout more closely in the 1990 edition, this 1999 edition gives us the best of both worlds (Strong's and Young's) and makes it a real must-have for your Bible reference book shelf!<br />Cheers!	2002-10-24

It is \\"exhaustive\\" in the sense that it indexes every important word but leaves out the articles, modifiers, pronouns and such that usually are not theologically significant for finding a passage in the Bible.<br />One area of disagreement is centered in the book's introduction. The editors state that the Greek-English index is not a dictionary.<br />I beg to differ.<br />The NIVEC (NIV Exhaustive Concordance) was based upon this same indexing method (should be since John R. Kohlenberger III was one of the editors). According to the editors of the NIVEC, the indexes do indeed constitute a lexicon in that the range of meaning is given by the different words used to translate the original Greek.<br />So, this index does, in fact, constitute a dictionary and the general meaning of the Greek word can easily be found by simply looking at the words which were used to translate the Greek word in the NRSV.<br />Good buy and a good reference tool.

Michel webb et al, have done a masterful job of proving once and for all that tithing is NOT a New Testament command.<br />It has been taught by many ministers and TV preachers that tithing is THE key to prosperity for the believer. Some preachers and teachers even go so far as to state that unless you tithe (work of the law, mind you) you don't even qualify for blessing.<br />Excuse me, but the New Testament example for prosperity and any gift we receive from God is based on 2 Corinthians 8:9. By His poverty, we become rich...not through the work of tithing. Giving should be from the heart as we have purposed; not by compulsion to a law. We are under Grace NOT the Law. We give because we are already blessed NOT to get blessed.<br />**The authors have covered this masterfully in their book.**<br />In addition, tithing was under the OT Law to which Christ did several things:<br />* Fulfilled it<br />* Abolished it<br />* Nailed it to His cross<br />* Slew the enmity (through his cross)<br />* Blotted out the handwriting of ordinances which were against us<br />All of these references deal with the Law. Consequently, as a one Dr. Jay Snell has noted, we obey the Law not as an external document which damns; but as an inward impulse. And further, if you are a Gentile by birth, you were NEVER under the Law to begin with. Only the Jew was given the Law.<br />Under the New Testament, the Christian was never and is never told to give a certain percentage by compulsion; on the contrary, we have the freedom to give freely as we have purposed in our hearts. Not a legalistic 10%, but an amount that we have chosen from the heart because we give out of love. This also means that giving beyond 10% is both possible and probable.<br />**The authors cover this in their book as well.**<br />Ask yourself reader: \\"Have I ever been blessed so much that I have not had room to receive it?\\" This is an oft-quoted promise based upon Malachi 3. But as you drive down the streets of anywhere, USA, you cannot tell the tithers on one side of the street from the non-tithers on the other side. Something is wrong somewhere.<br />And consider this: the very ministers who teach tithing as binding upon a New Testament Believer as THE way of prosperity are actually placing the very people they are trying to get blessed UNDER A CURSE!<br />How? Simple: by placing you under the Law in this one area of tithing, they are actually placing the burden to obey the ENTIRE Law upon you. Ministers cannot say, \\"Yes, we were redeemed from the Law but in this one area of tithing, it is still binding.\\" These ministers even quote Malachi 3--an Old Testament passage written to those under the Law--as proof that we are blessed by tithing. However, you cannot pick and choose which parts of the Law to keep. As Paul said in Galatians, \\"he that chooses to obey the law in one point is a debtor to the WHOLE entire Law.\\" In other words, if you take it upon yourself to obey one part of the Law, you are OBLIGATED to keep the entire thing! And with 613 different commands and ordinances to keep, it'll keep you busy. But this kind of teaching frustrates the very Grace teaching of the New Testament.<br />Either Christ<br />* Fulfilled the Law<br />* Abolished the Law<br />* Nailed the Law to His cross<br />* Slew the enmity (the Law)<br />* Blotted out the handwriting of ordinances (The Law) which were against us<br />or He didn't.<br />The Bible says He did. Therefore, tithing is no longer binding upon today's Christian.<br />Many who teach tithing agree that it was under the Law and then go back to the period before the Law to substantiate tithing as a principle. In other words, if tithing or the giving of ten percent occurred before the Law, then it is binding today.<br />But that is no argument. All of those who tithed before the Law were spiritually dead and there is no record of Adam and Eve tithing. Any appeal to the period of time before the law as proof of tithing being binding today inprinciple,  is on shaky ground at best.<br />**This book covers this as well as other objections.**<br />I recommend that if you purchase this book, also get other books such as NO More Tithing,\\" and \\"Did the Apostle Paul Teach Tithing to the Church?\\" These will prove once and for all that you are free to give...not obligated to give.is on shaky ground at best. <br />**This book covers this as well as other objections.**<br />I recommend that if you purchase this book, also get other books such as NO More Tithing,\\" and \\"Did the Apostle Paul Teach Tithing to the Church?\\" These will prove once and for all that you are free to give...not obligated to give.	2002-10-22

Young shows this by analyzing the English word showing all of the Greek or Hebrew words it translates and then lists the verses  containing each occurrence of the various Greek or Hebrew words.

George Green has done a service to the Body of Christ by dealing with a subject that is often taken for granted as preached. What's more, most Christians are taught not to dare question this doctrine for fear of being a &quot;God-robber.&quot;<br />I understand those who support tithing; I tithed for many years. Did I ever receive a blessing so big that I could not receive it (as those who teach tithing usually teach is a promised blessing)? Hardly.<br />And this was not due to lack of faith, &quot;tithing the tithe&quot; incorrectly, or failing to claim the promise. Truth is, this was a promise made under OT Law that was applicable for those who were the servants of Christ. Those who were under the Law. And if you are a Gentile by birth, you were NEVER under the Law to begin with. Only the Jews were.<br />We are Sons and we are also heirs. We give because we are already blessed NOT to get blessed. What is the basis for a NT Christian to be blessed? Tithing? NO! We are blessed through the same vehicle we are saved: the Cross of Christ. We through His poverty become rich...not through our tithing. This isn't to suggest that sowing and reaping do not work. It is a Biblical law. It always works. But it is not through a legalistic tithe but through what we have purposed in our hearts to give.<br />Ask yourself the question: &quot;Why can't I tell the difference between those who tithe on my street and those on the other street who don't?&quot; Something is seriously wrong with the way tithing is taught today.<br />This book is highly recommended--should be required reading for every Christian.	2002-10-15

Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Good overview of the subject	Kithcart has done the Body of Christ a service by providing this easily-read tome. Scholarly yet readable, Kithcart tackles the issue head on demonstrating what more and more Christians are discovering: tithing is not binding on today's believer.<br />Kithcart is strong on his assertions. And he should be. After all, he masterfully backs up what he states with scripture. Especially informative are the chapters where he shares the responses of several well-known ministries when asked about how to tithe and whether it was even for today.<br />As expected, most of the responses were based on Old Testament law instead of New Testament doctrine, proving once again the weak basis for teaching that tithing is applicable today.<br />The most powerful fact that Kithcart brings out pertains to Malachi 3.  Most advocates of tithing teach that a Christian is under a curse for not tithing--that we are &quot;God-robbers.&quot;<br />Again Kithcart responds to this by forcefully stating that a Blood-bought child of God under a better covenant is NOT under ANY curse! And I heartily agree.<br />Also, Christian, ask yourself: &quot;Have I been blessed so much that there is no room to receive it?&quot; I defy anyone to answer &quot;yes&quot; to this question. Most tithers who live on one side of the street can't be distinguished from the person on the other side who does not tithe. This alone should be a powerful reminder that something is very wrong with this teaching--especially the promise in Malachi 3 that most ministers are very quick to point out. And excuses that ministers give such as &quot;Well, you did not give it in faith&quot;, or &quot;You've gotta' claim the blessing&quot; etc., are excuses not reasons.<br />Buy it for its simple presentation but reread it for strength when the judaizers start spouting the Law instead of New Testament Grace!<br />Highly recommended!	2002-10-09

It is not scholarly due to this fact.

Some no doubt are valid. But what some have done is hold up the visions that one man has had to substantiate  theology or certain teaching. This is dangerous.<br />For instance, for many years I held to a certain belief even though scripture seemed to teach the opposite; but because Hagin had the vision, I assumed that Hagin was right and who am I to argue with that? Thank God, since then I have changed.<br />Hagin no doubt has been influenced by these visions and has used them to authenticate some of what he teaches. There is no problem with this perse,  but no matter if an angel from heaven appeared to him, the final teaching that Hagin puts out has to be judged by scripture NOT by the visions that Hagin had. (After all, we have a more sure word of prophecy and we did not have the visions. Hagin did.)<br />In summation, good book but be aware that these are one man's visions which must be judged by scripture.	2002-09-04

But, I challenge those who think this to go back and read the verse in context. Yes, Jew and Gentile were redeemed through Christ, but according to scripture, those who are under the curse of the Law are the same folks who are under the Law.  Now follow me: A Gentile was NEVER under the Law to begin with therefore, a Gentile is not redeemed from the curse of the Law for he was never under the Law to begin with. I challenge you to search the scriptures. Gentiles were never under the Law therefore, not under the curse of the Law.<br />But, a Gentile is under the curse that was brought through Adam and is redeemed from this curse through being grafted into the same blessing stream once only enjoyed by the Jews.<br />So, Hagin is correct to say that we are redeemed. I just believe that the way it is taught in modern charismatic christianity falls short of accuracy.	2002-09-03

Although it wasn't constantly  spoken about, the belief lurked in the theological background as a sort of  warning to luke-warm believers. Interesting thing that I have noticed is  that not one preacher who believes this can state exactly at what point and  what degree of sin will cause this precious loss. Interesting. I had had  nagging doubts about &quot;conditional security&quot; for many years and  the theological contradiction that goes with it. Then I found Dr. Stanley's  book.<br />Charles Stanley has done a masterful job of tackling tough  scriptures and dealing with the issue from both sides - exploring every  nuance. Although I differ slightly on his handling of Heb 6:4-6, I am in  agreement that it does not refer to losing one's salvation (but that is  splitting hairs and being bald, I don't have many to split with!)<br />In  general, if you believe in the unconditional eternal security of the  believer, you will find this book a refreshing and vibrant polemic against  &quot;maintenance-based&quot; salvation. If you do not believe in eternal  security, still this book provides a foundation as to why those of us who  are fear-free in regards to our security believe this way.	2000-04-08

Kirkwood has written a much needed corrective for those who have extended their theology to a point where suffering is no longer in their vocabulary. The author divides testing and trials into three areas: S.I.T.'s, D.I.T.'s  and M.I.T.'s. These are satan/suffering intended trials, discipline  intended trials and Maturation intended trials respectively.<br />In the book,  we are taken through several Biblical examples of suffering, observing the  who, how, what and why behind it and where God is in the trial.<br />David  kirkwood readily admits that he does not have all of the answers at the  outset but he does try to bring balance into areas where some in the Church  have erred in their &quot;suffering&quot; theology.<br />The book is not  without its faults however. In many cases, he raises more questions than he  answers. For instance, in dealing with the topic of weather and the  christian's ability to pray a storm away, Kirkwood gives the impression  that weather-related phenomena is less under the believer's jurisdiction  than many in the Church may think. Also, as far as christians getting hurt  in a weather-related accident, Kirkwood shrugs his shoulders and says that  it comes with the territory of living on planet earth even though the  Scriptures beare witness against this position by promising protection to  those who fear God.<br />This is just one example of the conundrums that are  presented in the book. Again, if you want a corrective to your thinking  about God's sovereignty, buy this book but do not look to it as a  substantive theology on the subject of suffering. Leave that to the Bible.	2000-04-08

McConnell's book has negatively influenced many readers concerning the word of faith, or simply, faith message.<br /><br />In it, he puts forth a thesis that Kenyon was cultic and that Hagin, by including extensive amounts of Kenyon's words in his teachings, is cultic as well--thus making the whole of the word of faith one big aberrant camp.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, researchers Joe Mcintyre and Paul King did extensive research and they have proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that Kenyon could not have been influenced by metaphysics or such like. The reason is because the timeline put forth by McConnell has been shown to be in error. Kenyon attended Emerson school of oratory but left before it became a hotbed of metaphysical teaching. McConnell's dates do not add up and contradict Kenyon's own testimony as to when he attended and when he left.<br /><br />The other problem is that when we, as the church, look to the cults to decide what we do and do not believe to be orthodox, we have already fallen into satan's trap. He always has counterfeits, and if you drop a teaching simply because it \\"sounds like\\" something the cults teach, you are doing your theology wrong.<br /><br />The Bible is the sole source of faith and practice. And regardless of what the cults teach, if we see something in the scriptures and it is right, then it is right regardless of how much or how little it resembles something in the cults.	2000-04-07

Most of the reviewers who gave the book low marks are, no doubt, Calvinists themselves (or have Calvinistic leanings) so it is no wonder that they rated it as such.<br />But any theological system must be consistent and when Calvinism is taking to its \\"logical\\" ends, it ends up contradicting itself and Scripture at the same time. Vance demonstrates this masterfully.<br />In fairness however, Vance has his share of problems when explaining some of the topics in the book. And sometimes his arguments shed more heat than light.<br />Overall, it is a good read and goes into the Calvinistic system, showing it for what it is: a man-made philosophical and logical system. A system that attempts to view the \\"mountain\\" of theology from its base at only one \\"Calvinistic\\" angle,  while authoritatively decreeing what the summit looks like based upon this limited view.<br />It may not convince an ardent Calvinist to change their mind (only the Holy Spirit can do that) but it does contribute to the debate in a scholarly way.	1999-08-30

In this series of books, the author attempts to point out pitfalls of various groups and sects. Ankerberg takes aim at the Word of Faith and &quot;parrots&quot; all of the old verbage heretofore stated without any  other insight. The book quotes various teachers but  the size of the book  does not allow a fair and accurate treatment of the Faith message as a  whole. If people would judge the Faith message or any message by the Word  instead of by their favorite preacher, they would be a lot better off.	1999-08-23
