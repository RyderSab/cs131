Some facilities--due to financial restraints--may not attain such detail.

I pulled many ideas from it to create my long/range plan.  I use it everyday for starter ideas.  Herr/Libby-Larson represent my biggest influences (other than my student teaching teacher) on my current practice.<br /><br />From the wonderful, interactive bulletin boards to the tons of hands-on activities to the graphic organizers, this book will meet all of your needs if you just needed one book.<br /><br />Along with Bredekamp/Copple's DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD and Steffen Saifer's THE EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHER'S MANUAL: PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO PRACTICALLY EVERY PROBLEM, this book should represent your first three members of your professional teaching library.	2004-12-18

Planning makes a teacher...period.  This curriculum teaches you to plan everything from the room arrangement to the assessment scheduling.  Active learning incorporates itself into all aspects.

One of the best early childhood books I have ever read, not mainly due to innovative solutions that really work.

After reading it, I realized how much curriculum knowledge I learned without getting the theory stuck in my way.<br /><br />I love theoretically based information-injecting, but I relished this book due to my past familiarity with the early childhood fathers.  I knew of Piaget, Vygotsky, Montessori, Kamii, Froebel, and the like. I needed some practical information, not those basics.  This book hit the spot. Please try it.	2004-07-29
