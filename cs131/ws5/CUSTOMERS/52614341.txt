US	52614341	RRS6NG9TP89VB	0071446494	493412732	The Ultimate New York Body Plan: Just 2 weeks to a total transformation	Books	5	57	60	N	N	VERY tough, VERY effective	After 2 weeks I lost 4 lbs, 2\\" from my waist, 2\\" from my hips, 1.5\\" around each upper arm.  I'm 5'5\\" and 128 lbs.  At first I was disappointed that I only lost 4 lbs, but then I saw the sleek muscles that I developed and my clothes fit better than ever before, I realized that it's not the weight that matters, but how your body looks and feels.  I got on this plan to lose those last 5 lbs and I felt I was in a rut in terms of my exercise routine ( I did Body for Life 2 years ago and lost 15 lbs which I've managed to keep off).  The New York Body plan was really tough, I broke up the hour and a half exercise a day into two parts: cardio-weights in the morning, and the 45 mins of cardio in the afternoon.  I also bought the New York Body Plan DVD and I found that to be key.  There is no way I'd finish the cardio weights session in 45 mins if I didn't have the DVD to follow.  The first two days, I had to pause the DVD during a few exercises to complete the reps because they were too hard to do at the speed that David was doing them.  It really helps to see someone doing the exerices because it shows you how it should look and the speed at which you should do them, so I highly recommend getting the DVD.  As other reviewers mentioned, the recipes in the back are really delicious.  I don't eat red meat, so I stuck mostly with the omelettes and fish recipes.  For some recipes, such as the turkey lasagna, I substituted tofu for the turkey and it tasted great, my husband loved it too.  The recipes are really keepers and I've worked them into my weekly menus.  They're so easy, healthy and delicious.  The plan was very tough, I was ready to quit after Day 2 (I was sore, hungry, and tired), but it gets exponentially easier on Day 3 and by Day 4 I began to see results and felt much more energized.  It is really worth it, get this book and DVD to jumpstart your goal and maintain the results.  David has a whole maintenance section in the back that tells you how to ease off the two weeks and keep the results.  After following the plan for 2 weeks, I find that I look forward to doing the cardio-weights, they're very effective and David is highly motivational.  In the book, there is a section that counts down the two weeks day by day, with a sample menu for the day, the exercise routin to follow for the day, a success story of one of David's clients, and an inspirational message from David.  And there is space for you to chart your progress, what you ate, what exercises you did and how you felt.  David is really with you every step of the way.  You can do anything for 2 weeks.  It's really worth it.	2005-07-17

I related very much to Anne's trials and tribulations.  Avonlea and the people who inhabited the town came alive for me with the turn of every page.  The characters were vivid and the places were described memorably.  Recently, I found this book on sale at a bookstore and I couldn't help buying it.  I thought I'd revisit my favorite childhood book and see if anything has changed.  It certainly has, but it has made it for the better.  I finally related to the adults of the book and I found them to be fascinating characters as well, previously overlooked when I was a child.  The children of Avonlea were still as interesting as ever and their imagination as wild as ever, none rivaling Anne's of course.  It was a wonderful stress reliever to be transported to a simpler time and wholesome place.  It's a great book for children, but with enough complexity in the characters and town events to keep an adult interested.  If you've never read Anne of Green Gables as a kid, you might not relate to what I'm saying, but I'd recommend this book to anyone who was a fan when they were young.	2003-08-18

In 12 weeks, I lost 15 lbs. (from 145 to 130, I went from a size 10 to a size 6) and I have managed to keep it off for over a year.  It has completely changed my way of eating and it helped make exercise a regular part of my life.  In the first 12 weeks, I was very strict and followed the plan almost to the tee (I had to fiddle with it a bit because I'm vegetarian).  Now that I've reached my goal, I find that I don't have to be as strict to maintain my weight.  I feel healthier than ever and I eat mostly whatever I want (that's because following the plan makes you want to eat healthy things that make you look and feel good).  Bill Phillips puts everything in VERY simple terms and the plan is very easy to follow.  What could be easier than doing 20 mins of cardio every other day and 45 mins of weights every other day?  You get a free day where you don't work out and eat whatever you want (literally whatever - pizza, pasta, chocolate, ice-cream).  Like I said, I'm not that strict now, so I'll have a little bit of those things on other days too, and now I tend to work out 4-5 days a week instead of 6.  But still, it's a much healthier lifestyle than the one I had before and it's all thanks to this book.  The photos inside the cover jacket shows all these people with great results.  Some people are distrustful of those photos, I am not.  Regardless, the most striking difference to me isn't even in their bodies, but in the genuine happiness and pride that shows on their faces in the after-photos.  Older people look younger and not-so-pretty people are great-looking, mainly because of the confidence that exudes from their bright faces.  Try it - What's the harm?  The book is [not expensive] and it's 12 weeks.  If it doesn't work for you, it wasn't a great loss.  But if it works for you, like it did for me, then it'd be the best [money] you ever spent.	2003-08-12

The author did a lot of research on the 9th century and it was worth reading just for that because that period is rarely mentioned in books nowadays (I guess the dark ages is not what most people would call an interesting era).  Some of the details in the book get repetitive after a while, like the medicines used to treat certain diseases in those days, the clothing style, and other everyday details.  I found the book to be too rushed in the end.  The author spent a long time on Joan's childhood and adolescent years and then rushed through her career in the church, so not enough time was spent to convince the reader of the key events that made it possible for Joan to become Pope.  In the end, I felt that the sequence of events was a little too incredible, but then again, if this story is true, it would have to be one crazy story.  I'm still not convinced that there was ever a Pope Joan, but I'm glad to have made acquaintance with Joan, the fictional character.	2001-11-26

There were a lot of literary allusions to Woolfe's writing which I did not get.  I think that if you didn't read Woolfe and or if you don't like her style, then you won't like this book much.  I would save it for the future after you've come to appreciate Virginia Woolfe.  I myself am not a Woolfe fan, I've tried to read Orlando twice now, and each time I'm bogged down by the language, and Orlando is supposed to be Woolfe's most accessible book.  You could still follow The Hours  because it does have a plot of its own.  The three women in the book eventually all tie together in the end.  Clever people will figure out the ending 1/2 way or 3/4 of the way through the book though.	2001-08-17

I also like it that she writes Teddy's experiences from Teddy's point of view, in his voice.  You can relate to Teddy much better and understand his frustration in what he's done.  The only thing is, I don't think I would respond the same way as Giselle, and it made the story a little less believable for me.  In the story, she is relatively calm after her daughter dies and she pretty much goes back to her life.  She even has the energy to put on makeup for her daughter's funeral.  I find that a little unbelievable, but then again, I'm not a mother and everyone deals with death differently.  It's a good story, but not everyone will relate to the characters because death is such a personal thing and in my opinion, Swick hasn't done enough to make us relate to each of her central characters.  It looks like it'll make a good made-for-TV-movie, but as a book, it's lacking in deep analysis and full character development.	2001-08-17
US	52614341	R1T1BVIY31XHBP	0452280621	675572194	Beloved	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Indelible footprint in American literature	I understand some people's frustrations in reading this book.  It's not a straight-forward &quot;here's the plot and here's how it ends&quot; kind of book.  The plot or central theme of the book is simple enough, a slave-woman escapes to the free north and the aftermath of her supposed freedom.  As in Song of Solomon, Toni Morrison uses magical realism to drive her story, it's reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende.  I think it adds an element to the book that heightens its emotions.  Slavery is a difficult subject to write about, and to write about it from a personal viewpoint, rather than a historical viewpoint is even harder.  I think Morrison has successfully done that in Beloved.<br />To those who didn't understand the book or wanted to force it into something commonplace so it's more palatable to their pop-culture minds, I say to them, you're missing out on a great piece of American culture and literature.  Those who didn't like it are probably young, undergraduate or high school kids who simply don't have the patience for a story that requires a lot of thinking and feeling.  Also, I believe you have to know suffering or have the capacity to understand and relate to other people's suffering to fully appreciate this book.  A young person or a person who has lived a life of privilege, be it financially or emotionally, will have trouble sharing the meaning of this book.<br />It's true that the style of the book is different and combines elements of different writing formats.  Morrison uses poetry and stream-of-consciousness style writing in parts of the book.  You just have to take it for what it is and not fight it too much.  It's a personal voice, a personal story, a personal pain.  You don't have to get everything everyone writes.  Focus on the beautiful story-telling and the emotions it stirs in you.  American writing needs this willingness to experiment to create a different and distinct voice.	2001-08-15

Besides the Meat Market, the Beast Market and doing laundry by hand, I didn't see anything remarkable about the Delft that the author created.  It might as well have been any rich household in any country outside of the US.  I've never been to Holland and I could have made up the same details.  The story itself was too simple: a maid gets painted by Vermeer and his wife doesn't like it.  First of all, I personally find it unlikely that Vermeer needed a maid to clean his studio every day.  I found the drama in the story to be oversized, simple things are made into a big deal.  Everytime Griet cries or feels an injustice done to her, I just didn't see what the big deal was.  Since the story is done in Griet's voice, you don't get to know the other characters as well and you know almost nothing of Vermeer.  Throughout the book, he's simply known as &quot;he&quot;.  I think it was an unwise decision to write the book in Griet's voice especially because we keep hearing how she's smarter than she lets on and how she's so wise she can see through people's words.  It would have been more effective and believable if the compliments were coming from an observer rather than herself.  It made her story less believable in a sense by writing it in first person.	2001-06-27

In terms of giving me insights into a geisha's life, I think it delivered.  But the plot development was lacking and I could not relate to the main character.  The main character falls in love with a chairman after a brief (and I mean, very brief) encounter with him, he doesn't even remember her.  She becomes obsessed with him and the plot is driven by her quest for his love.  Then there was there was this other plot line where there was a bidding war for her virginity.  I just couldn't care less.  Basically, I don't like it that she was made into this Cinderella character where everyone around her was either ugly, mean, or vengeful and she was all pure and beautiful.  Give me a break.  I can't relate to characters like that.  They should be flawed like real people, not all self-congratulative, the best in dance, the best in wine pouring, the best this and that.  It gets boring after a while.  The only thing I liked were the geisha details, but I'm sure I could have gotten that from another book.  It was not worth reading over 500 pages for that in this disappointing book.	2001-06-23

I fell asleep each time I tried to read it and I eventually had to give up.  I am a scientist and I am very interested in the history of science and the people behind the discoveries, but this book was not at all what I expected.  It was not personal at all, the first few chapters were like a long history lecture full of uninteresting details.  Dave Sobel's writing didn't help either.  She writes as if she's still writing for the NY Times, very removed and impersonal.  Her writing did not draw me into the story at all.  I couldn't wait to hear more about Galileo's daughter, as this book had promised, but I'm more 1/4 of the way through and she was reluctantly mentioned in several places.  I know two people who really liked it and they were both 60 years old, I think this book is definitely for an older audience who has more patience.  I give it two stars instead of one b/c Ms. Sobel did a lot of research for the book and she deserves some credit.	2001-06-22

As a passive observer, he followed them from the crime scene to the emergency rooms, to the medical examiner's office, to the victims' homes and the courtroom.  He has a real eye for details and he has an incredible knack for picking up dialogue and personality of individuals.  I didn't notice till almost the end of the book that he wrote the entire book in present tense.  This well-thought out move made the book that much more real and intense.<br />I had real misconceptions about this book before I read it.  I thought it was all about killing and the gore of killing.  As a female in my 20's, this was not a book I would have reached for on my own.  Had my husband not insisted, I would not have read it and now I can't praise it enough and I would recommend it to everyone who cares about their society, everyone who wants to experience the amazing lives of people they would otherwise never know.  <br />Read it for the writing, the superb organization, the accessible language, the incredible details.  David Simon is an excellent writer and journalist.  This book was long, but it was never boring because David Simon experimented with it.  Sometimes he wrote from the detectives' point of perspective, sometimes the victims', sometimes the criminals themselves and sometimes from his own.  He really captured Baltimore in the late 80s with his keen observation and perception of what is relevant.  Some of the stories he covered are crazy, if it didn't say in large print that this was all true, I would not believe it.  Some of the stories are funny, some are incredibly sad, but they are all interesting and are all a part of the regular lives of the Baltimore detectives and for that matter, probably detectives in every major city in the country.  I cannot praise this book enough.  After reading this book, I cannot ever watch CSI or Law and Order again with the same enthusiasm.  You realize how much more complex real crimes are and you just end up laughing at those TV shows.  You begin to understand police work and you have a new respect for those who have devoted their lives to solving crimes.  David Simon was very fair in his book, he kept it real by telling you the good and the bad.  You begin to see everyone involved as real people, the police, the criminals, and the victims.	2001-06-17

I wished I had read this book earlier so I could have seen how trivial people's everyday problems were compared to what Shackleton and his crew faced.  It is an incredible story of survival and leadership.  Even though this book was written so many years ago, it is in accessible language and it draws from the diaries of the men in the crew.  It doesn't have pictures but I thought it was better that way because I could focus on the story itself.  Alfred Lansing's language is very accessible and although some of my friends mentioned that the navigation/boating language was sometimes too much for them to follow, they appreciated it nonetheless because it made everything more real.  It immersed them into the story.  The book does rush through the last part of the rescue process a bit, but there are other books out there that can fill in the gaps.  This book is a classic, if you are looking for a book to begin to get to know Shackleon, his crew and their incredible voyage, this is it.	2001-06-15

Beautifully illustrated in a classic style, the book brings out the best about the love shared by dogs everywhere and their owners.  It's a book about a little dog whose bravery and loyalty to his owner brings them together again.  I have chihuahuas and I am involved in chihuahua rescue, so this book is especially meaningful to me.  It's the only book I know of with a chihuahua as a character.  But the story is universal and simple enough to be shared with a child.  They don't make books like this any more.	2001-06-15

I related to it tremendously because I was the oldest child in my family and I had to take care of my sisters often because my parents worked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Of course, this is nothing compared to what Dicey had to go through, but I remember thinking what an incredible story this was and it was first time that responsibility was presented to me so clearly in a book.  For the first time, I read about someone who cared more about her family than herself, this is very different from the usual young adult books you read out there.  I also learned for the first time what resourcefulness means.  Dicey had to do a lot of &quot;resourceful&quot; things to keep her family together.  All in all, I learned many important lessons from this book.  It's definitely more serious than the Harry Potter books that all the kids are reading today.  This book dealt with a lot of serious issues, I can imagine that kids nowadays might not relate to it because it seems to me that kids nowadays have no worries and no responsibilites.	2001-06-13

The characters in this book are each so fully developed, you feel like you know them personally and you understand their motives for their actions.  There is no one-dimensional character in this book and the plot is totally driven by the characters' flaws and aspirations.  I learned so much about early 20th century Black history from reading this book.  I really think it should be assigned reading for any student of American history and/or literature. I especially enjoyed the dialogue of the book, it's written in such a real and lively way that I could actually &quot;hear&quot; the different voices of the characters.  The style of the book, in that it has elements of magic realism, reminds of the books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude.  It's a book you have to think through, it's not what I would call light, summer reading.  But if you are willing to put in a little more time and energy, you will be rewarded with a well-crafted story that spans several generations.	2001-06-06

I got it as a gift from a friend and at first I thought, &quot;Great, not another Asian novel about immigration, respect or growing up displaced.&quot;  It wasn't anything like I thought.  It's a modern, quirky novel about the evil meat industry, with wonderful, quirky Japanese and American characters.  The two main characters of the book, one a Japanese-American woman from NYC and the other a traditional Japanese housewife play off each other really well and are each very well developed.  Ozeki uses &quot;actual&quot; faxes, letters, memos to move the plot along, which I thought was really creative (in a good way).  I learned a lot about the meat industry from reading this book, she did extensive research on the topic and she weaves the facts in cleverly into the novel so it doesn't feel like a big lecture.  All in all, the book was really entertaining, and I hope Ozeki will write more books in the future, I really enjoyed her fresh voice.	2001-06-06

I was a chemical engineering major in college and after a few years out of school, I decided to go to graduate school for a PhD in molecular biology.  Being that I had no formal education in biology whatsoever, I decided to take the biology test rather than the biochemistry because I think it's a much easier test to study for from ground zero (and I was right).  I had no idea what to expect from the test, so this book helped a lot to demystify it.  I knew what type of questions were asked and whatever I didn't understand, I would look it up in a textbook or on the web (you'd be surprised how much biology one can learn on the web, so many colleges put up study guides and reviews for their students and everyone can have access to them).  What's the point of studying for the test, if you don't practice on the official version?  On the real test, I actually saw some of the same questions.  They actually recycle questions, just posed in slightly different ways.  I only study using this guide and the Princeton Review guide (and supplemented with textbooks here and there), and I got a decent enough score to get me into three graudate schools in NYC, including Columbia, NYU and Albert Einstein.  I couldn't have done it without this book.  This is NOT an endorsement of ETS, by the way, I think ETS is one of the most evil empires ever created on earth and I think the government should shut them down because they are an unfair monopoly with no real consumer or educational value.  ETS is the biggest scam that was ever invented.  I'm endorsing this book because you have to learn the system to beat the system.	2001-06-05

It was interesting to see how people in the same household can react so differently to the same tragedy.  I especially enjoyed the part from Teddy, the 10 year old boy's perspective.  His was the most tender because he was not yet even old enough to comprehend the magnitude of what he did, although there was no doubt in his mind that it would change his life forever.  I appreciated that this was not a sappy story.  It wasn't written to draw tears from the reader.  It was a real character-study on how different people can react to extreme tragedy and how each is able to move on from that point.  Each character had his/her own flaws and you can relate better to them because of that.  I thought the set-up of the story was really well-thought out: brother kills half-sister, stepfather harbors hatred for stepson, mother caught in the middle, real father wanting to take away the boy to protect him.  It's a very real situation and a very difficult one to write about in so many voices and Marly Swick did a good job at it.	2001-06-05

All I can think of is how so short and simple a book can pack so much human drama in it.  To this day, it still gives me materials to think about.  I didn't know that the story was semi-autobiographical until later, but I thought so just from reading it because it so intimately describes the young girl's feelings that it would be impossible to make it all up.  The description of the crossing of the Mekong River in the beginning will always remain in my mind.  So simple, so elegant, and so strong an image.  The book was like a beautiful, impressionist painting.  There is also a movie by the same title that comes close to capturing the beauty of the book, but of course, nothing can compare to the actual words of Marguerite Duras, a beautiful and mysterious woman shaped by the events of this book.  To get to the truth of her life, one must read and interpret this book on their own.	2001-05-23

I came to my senses eventually and I ended up applying to PhD programs in biology.  I thought I wasted money on this book, but then I gave it a chance and it actually gives great overall advice on writing effective personal statements for ANY purpose.  Graduate schools all look for the same thing ultimately, they want to know what you are about and they want to know why you chose your career path.  This book is great because it gives you examples of people coming from all sorts of background and you can draw on all their experiences to put together your own essay.  I even stole a line from one of the essays because it applied to my own life and I wouldn't have found a better way to say it.  I'm going to Columbia University starting this fall, so I guess my personal statement wasn't half bad.  This book made the job a lot easier, especially if you have writer's block like I did.  It really gives you a starting point.	2001-05-23
US	52614341	R1UVVJYPL6I3CN	068484267X	698161422	Angela's Ashes: A Memoir	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A truly great memoir	It took Frank McCourt 20 years to write it, but it only took me two days to read it, and I'll never forget it.  I'm not one of those people who give out 5 stars easily but this was truly one of the best books I've ever read.  I feel like I really know Mr. McCourt and the Ireland that he knew.  I cried with him and I laughed with him.  It's a story about family, love, poverty, religion, human nature.  I learned so much from reading this book.  My husband and I agree that we are going to share this book with our children as soon as they are old enough just so they can see how lucky they are to live in a prosperous time (not that we are rich people - but I know our children have never experienced hunger the way Mr. McCourt and his family have).  It's not how much you have, but what you make of it.  <br />I have also learned about writing from reading this book.  His organization is superb and his writing style is very engaging.  Even the saddest parts are written with wit and a sharpness that transcends beyond the emotions to get to the human truth.  I cannot praise this book enough.  If nothing else, read it and step into a great person's shoes for a while.	2001-05-22
US	52614341	R2AGJEEEGW3WQ	0375706410	663303744	Waiting: A Novel	Books	4	1	6	N	N	Great story about modern China	At first I was very disappointed by the book's ending, which I will not disclose.  I think I always expect to like the main character of the book and I didn't like this one, Lin.  I felt that he was a weak person and I couldn't sympathize with him.  Then I realized that the author might not have necessarily wanted us to like Lin.  Maybe he was only using Lin and his story that spans over 18 years to tell us about China and the culture of the communist party.  In that context, Lin's story isn't really important.  The &quot;waiting&quot; was not the main theme of the book, the main theme was the life of an average Chinese man or woman in communist China in the 70s and early 80s.  In other words, I was too focused on the plot of the book, but I think that wasn't what the book was about, it was just an instrument for the author to describe modern China and the Chinese mind-set.<br />I felt that the book was definitely written for a Western audience.  I mean, if you're writing a book for the Chinese audience, you wouldn't be describing the food at every meal, which was what the author did.  He didn't say Lin and his family sat down for dinner, he described every dish they were having.  I don't know if that was good or not.  I found it a bit annoying, but others may appreciate the details because it showed them a different culture.  <br />Read this book if you're interested in how the average person lives in China and what it's like to live in a communist country.  It's hard to imagine but very well captured by Ha Jin.	2001-05-17
US	52614341	R1AC6J4TUX8VEA	039592720X	658159771	Interpreter of Maladies	Books	3	7	12	N	N	Good, but not Pulitzer-worthy	I think the only reason this book won a Pulitzer is because its topic is exotic to westerners.  Had the same kind of book been written about Western Texas, there would have been no Pulitzer.  I thought the stories were entertaining and I appreciated the history and cultural elements, but I thought the stories themselves were not particularly creative or interesting.  Take for example, &quot;Sexy&quot;, it's about an American woman having an affair with a married man originally from Bangladesh.  There's nothing special about the story other than the fact that it involves someone of another ethnicity and even then, the difference between the two cultures didn't play that big a part in the story.  <br />A lot of her stories leave me hanging at the end.  Especially with short stories, I expect a sort of revelation and satisfying ending, like my friend telling me a story.  Usually the ending is the best part, you listen carefully so you can get the punch line.  It's not like a novel where you have the time and luxury to meander, put the book down and ponder.  A lot of her stories end abrubtly, as if she ran out of things to say and that's where she decided to end it.  I felt this way about her story about Boori-Ma.  That's why I say it only won a Pulitzer because it's about a foreigh culture.  You would not tolerate such a story about &quot;boring&quot; Americans.	2001-05-17
US	52614341	R5TOTTUZXG7F5	0809232529	7706063	How To Get Into Harvard Law School	Books	2	47	52	N	N	Save your money	You're going to be attracted to this book no matter what I tell  you.  You'll buy it because you want to see what your competition is, you want to know if you're &quot;up there&quot; with the rest of them.  This book will do nothing but introduce doubt for you.  This book is filled with people who got 4.5 and above GPAs and LSAT scores of 170 and better.  You already know from looking at Harvard's statistics that these are the scores you need to get in, so why do you need this book to reinforce the idea?  The experiences of the people in this book are so varied that it really doesn't help to read them. All it really tells you is that Harvard looks for a diverse group of students who all scored well on the LSAT and did very well in college.  This is nothing that you don't already know.  Personally, I think most people in the book were annoying.  They are the type who are so proud of themselves that they decided to broadcast their scores and experiences to the public in a book.  It's an advertisement for egomaniacs.  If you're applying to law school right now, you can't go back in time and change your GPA or college activities.  You can only concentrate on you LSAT scores. Save your money and buy some LSAT review books or take a Kaplan course.  (I give it two stars instead of one b/c it might help someone who is still in college.  You can read this and see that you have to work damn hard in school and get good grades to get into Harvard law school).	2001-02-05
US	52614341	RKL1PNW2MMP66	0375705198	314955975	Amy and Isabelle: A novel	Books	2	10	15	N	N	reads like a supermarket novel	Originally, when I read this book, I thought it was going to be a deep exploration of mother/daughter relationship and a &quot;literary gem&quot;.   It turns out to read like a little paperback, it's certainly not literary.   I found the small town setting to be too stereotypical.  I thought a lot  of the side stories were undeveloped and the characters were  one-dimensional.  It was almost like the author needed some filling to keep  the story from becoming just about mom and daughter.  It felt like I was  &quot;reading&quot; a soap opera and not a very good one.  Because of its  soap opera quality, the story line was totally predictable.  Also, I found  Isabelle and Amy to be very annoying people, especially Isabelle.  It was  hard to sympathize with her.	2000-08-30
US	52614341	RFIK4L4XT2W4H	0440220602	233513923	The Chamber	Books	1	10	14	N	N	How did this get published?	This was one of the worst books I've read in my life.  The dialog was terrible in the book and there were many loose ends and undeveloped subplots in the book.  I can't go into details because it would give away  the ending, but basically at the end of the book, you end up thinking to  yourself, &quot;Wait a minute, whatever happened to this person and this  subplot?  What did that event have anything to do with anything else in the  book?&quot;  It was an example of sloppy thinking and poor editing on the  editor's part.  If you buy this book against my advice, I suggest that you  read the dialog to yourself and see how phony it sounds.  Nobody talks like  that.  Basically, Grisham is writing as he always has, he thinks he's  writing a movie.  It's not literature, it's Hollywood scenes on paper.   It's really poor writing.	2000-06-20
