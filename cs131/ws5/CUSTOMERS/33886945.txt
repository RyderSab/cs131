Yes there is more violence now than 20 years ago but that's not just in America, 'it's all over the world'.<br />And 'weather changes' are occuring 'globally' - so obviously it's not just America that's under God's wrath - if you assume that weather changes are God's judgment.<br />Our 'ozone layer' is fragmenting due to 'pollution' - man is wrecking the earth. Scientists and Environmentalists warned us 30 years ago this was going to happen if we didn't make serious changes then.<br />It's easy to put everything in a 'God's judgment basket' and just say 'God is mad so He's going to destroy the earth'. He is 'longsuffering' not 'wanting anyone to perish' - we on the otherhand are like John (apostle) when he said to Jesus 'call down fire from heaven and destroy them'.<br />I have difficulty with people who believe they are prophets, even one so well known and respected as David Wilkerson. &quot;For all the law and the prophets prophesied until John&quot;. (Matt. 11:13) This is speaking about John the Baptist. 'The law' and 'the prophets' (Old Testament writings) prophesied 'until' meaning 'up to' John, meaning John was 'the last' prophet. It was John who 'introduced Jesus' to the world and after the Lord was revealed there was 'no need for any more prophets'. If we say we need more prophets we are actually saying that Jesus was not 'the fulfillment' of 'the law and the prophets' and we need 'more prophets' to show us the way.<br />If people go looking for prophets then anti-Christ will find a willing audience because he's going to be the best prophet ever because he will be able to explain the secrets of the ages, and the false prophet who introduces him will be able to perform amazing miracles. Be careful that you are not watching for the wrong things!!!	2003-10-08

The author says and I quote 'flesh refers to the old ways or patterns by which you have attempted to get all your needs supplied instead of seeking Christ first and trusting Him to meet your needs'.<br />The word 'flesh' in Greek means just that, flesh as in 'flesh and bones'.<br />The new person in Christ has 'old habits' and 'patterns of behaviour and thinking' which need to be crucified. This is a process. Though they have come to Christ, a person can still struggle with sin 'in their soul life' (human or earthly self, flesh, body) their spirit on the otherhand is brand new.<br />Only the 'spirit' is immediately regenerated, the soul is not, the soul must be purified, saved;(&quot;...to the saving of the soul&quot;) which comes with time. The reason many of us struggle is because our soul is not yet purified.<br />This book and others like it, though I give them points for trying to help others, merely end up redirecting the soul to other things rather than the necessity of transformation. That was God's purpose for giving us 'a spirit' in the first place, so that it (our circumcised spirit) could then influence and purify our souls, making them fit for heaven.<br />The reason many souls are not being purified, and the honest ones will despair, is because they are being instructed by the wrong 'Word', and so they cannot have victory.	2003-08-29

Perhaps I'm just getting tired of reading the same information, repeated by different people. The temptation with three points of view of the rapture is to be complacent (there's no need to worry, we'll be safe), or scared (because we don't have the facts). But then, what if I'm wrong in my choice of one of three? What if all three of those viewpoints are wrong? <br />The point I'm trying to make is there cannot be 'three' viewpoints on the rapture. Sometimes I wonder if authors raise more questions to mask the fact that they cannot answer the question directly. But somewhere in the Bible there is only 'one' answer to this question.	2003-07-29

Firstly he's not just 'repeating' what everybody else has said on this subject,  he's shed a lot of new light on the mysterious subject of anti-Christ. It's so refreshing to read his insights.<br />I would like to contest some ideas because this book is based on two important themes: (1)the idea that Tim seems to share is that the anti-Christ (one person) has two horns because of the verse; \\"he had two horns like a lamb but spoke like a dragon.\\" <br />The Book of Daniel speaks of a Ram with one 'horn' between it's eyes and later says 'the horn is the first king', so therefore, a 'horn' is 'a king'. There are two 'horns' comprising (a lamb)and anti-Christ is referred to as the 'little horn' in Daniel. Therefore, 'two' notable people who will arise to prominence in the end times. Their deception is not apparent in their demeanor but in their words, 'spoke like a dragon'. These two are 'anti-Christ' and 'the false prophet' who ride to power on the scarlet beast with 'seven heads and ten horns' (powerful ruling spiritual/government body in the end times). Daniel says the ten 'horns' are ten 'kings'!<br />2)The author sites the Bilical criteria for a possible anti-Christ and names Charles, but I have trouble with this, again, because of the book of Daniel. Not that Charles could not be, in future, this person, but presently he has none of the criteria of anti-Christ. <br />Daniel says that anti-Christ will know 'secrets' (parables), he will be able to explain 'mysteries' (referred to as dark secrets). He will 'not initially be a person of influence and wealth' but will gain that through 'trading' because of the 'great wisdom' he will come to have. He will possess wisdom greater than Solomon's. The Queen of Sheba travelled half way around the world to hear Solomon's wisdom and said, 'I was not told the half of it'. <br />Some reviews are too strong! To express an opinion is a basic human right - whether we agree with someone ornot. If you take that away you take away freedom itself.	2003-07-15

The authors make a very good point that Biblical prophecy must be interpreted 'literally' as is all the Bible. <br />With that in mind I had hoped to read a book that would actually 'explain' the Revelation. However, reading further I discovered the authors merely reiterate the same old information; although they did it very well and at a level which is easily understood, I think that is commendable. <br />I know God did not give the Revelation to John as a cruel joke to humanity, something we could never possibly hope to understand correctly. The authors do explain that God is perfect and so His word is perfect, therefore, if there are inconsistencies in teaching it must be human beings who make the errors because God does not make mistakes. It was refreshing to hear it from that perspective because then at least I have hope there is an answer to this current enigma in God's word.	2003-07-01

The book is very easy reading which I prefer to the more text-book-like writing of some authors. <br />I do have a few problems with this and all other books on prophecy. Max Anders, as other authors, say prophecy is extremely important but cannot 'explain' the Revelation. Max Anders is not alone, it very much appears to me that writers are all 'repeating' basically the same information. <br />I believe a benevolent God would not leave such important matter without an explanation. However, since all authors I've read can't seem to give that, I guess I have to be content with that and Max Anders writes that information as well as anyone.	2003-06-22

Gary Demar certainly makes a point that people have been predicting the end of the world for a long time now and all of those predictions have failed. However, the Bible does not say that will be the end-time message. The actual message of the end times is really the reverse; people will be saying (I paraphrase)'where is this return you've been predicting all these generations?' Therefore, if I read correctly that Gary says Christ has already come then he makes himself a type of anti-Christ who mocks the return of Christ. The sky (universe - veil) 'recedes as a scroll' when Christ returns, that has obviously not happened yet because we're still here. In the beginning of Acts when Jesus is 'taken to heaven in a cloud' the angel says 'He will so come in like manner as you saw Him go'. Therefore, the blessed event of Christ's return is yet to come but Jesus said; &quot;will I find faith on the earth when I return.&quot; <br />There is too much in the Bible that points to the 'return' of Christ but people 'who do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God' either predict it prematurely or say it has already occured.	2003-06-21

Very well researched and written. If you like well documented historical Christian works this is a good book. <br />I would differ with the author on this one important point though! Had the book been written with this point in mind I would have given it a five. The author says in his opening statements, 'the central doctrine of the Bible is the message of salvation'. I believe that is wrong. The central message of the Bible is 'Christ'. When we find Jesus we find salvation and all the other benefits of 'knowing Him'. If we focus stricly on salvation then our focus is off. Jesus Christ must be the center from which everything else flows.	2003-06-10

It's probably a little above the heads of many new Christians, but a very good theological work nontheless. <br />The author makes the case that Christianity should leave some very 'positive' evidences on those who profess to have it, and so it should. <br />The author blames a diluted gospel for the lack of 'spiritual evidences' in the lives of many who profess Christ, yet there are many serious Christians who struggle. <br />The author propagates 'works' (mostly difficulties) as the way to attain spiritual maturity, which is just as bad as 'too much grace'. <br />People are 'saved by grace through faith', the initial work (grace) is accomplished by God. Obviously whatever God does is good so it has to be whatever is coming afterwards (the teachings of  men) that is causing all the problems.	2003-06-02

The author reminds us that people all over the world, both Christian and non, have known for some time there is a part of human beings that goes on 'after death'. It is good to be reminded of this because we all too easily become so attached to this life.<br />It is the Christian hope that even though our body dies we have the resurrection from the dead to look forward to. This is not just Catholic theology but an evangelical teaching as well.<br />Bavinck gives evidence for the immortality of the 'soul'. Although he is correct that we are immortal in some part, the soul is not that part. The Bible says human beings are made in three parts; spirit, soul and body (1 Thess.). &quot;God is a Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.&quot; If God is a 'spirit' and we must worship Him 'in spirit' meaning 'in our spirit', then it has to be 'our spirit' that is is 'made in His image' and therefore, immortal. <br />Body and soul were created 'on the earth', they are 'earthly' therefore, they are 'mortal'. A 'mortal' entity cannot contain an 'immortal' one. The mortal soul cannot contain God's immortal Spirit! <br />Body and soul are used synonymously in Scripture but the 'spirit' is different. Upon spiritual regeneration it is the 'spirit' of human beings that is circumcised (&quot;circumcise the foreskin of your heart&quot;). 'Heart' translated means 'spirit'!  It is the 'spirit' that immediately goes either to paradise or hell after a person dies, the body remains in the grave until the resurrection from the dead.<br />Bavinck has researched his historical information well and he is correct in many of his theories. However, I found the book read like a textbook and was a little hard to follow.	2003-05-28

However, Paul wrote in the gospels and I paraphrase,'God has rejected them but at some time a remnant of Jacob will be grafted back into the good olive tree'. We love Israel because we love Christ and the Scriptures but that can blind us to the realism that the doctrine of 'the scribes and the teachers of the law' is alive and well today.

One implies 'a process of learning' the other 'work hard or else you're going to be rejected'. What is it about Christians that they are not happy unless they are beating themselves up over some failure to please God?

It is an honest and good question, however, Paul the apostle was constantly admonishing disciples to move on to spiritual maturity so as not to remain babes in Christ.

The author says that Jesus didn't clarify what he meant exactly by the 'the kingdom of God', Jesus just assumed we should know what it means. The author then gives scripture verses to explain what he, the author, 'thinks' Jesus meant. I somehow don't think the Lord would be so vague about such an important issue. Stranger still is the Lord's words in the gospels. Speaking to the Pharisees, He says &quot;the kingdom of heaven is within you&quot;. Jesus told the Pharisees the kingdom of heaven was 'within' them. What's with that??? I believe the author also mis-read the intent of many of the scripture verses.

This is definitely new age type thinking. The message of the book is 'you've been programmed all wrong' and the author is going to show you how to get better in his condescending type way. He says that many subconcious motivations are wrong and we need to change them. I would remind the author at this point that 'subconcious' motivations are just that, 'sub' concious, which means 'hidden', not something we can control. Jesus must 'heal' wrong subconcious motivations and that takes many years and that can only happen as people become 'aware' of certain 'negative' behaviour patterns in their lives. However, that doesn't make the 'entire' person a complete right-off, nor does having 'healthy emotions' make people freaks in God's eyes. 'Healthy' emotions is enjoying family, friends and the beauty of life in general. 'Times for celebrating' were common in the Old Testament writings. This books encourages people to stop being 'human', having 'healthy' human drives, ambitions and motivations. The writer of wisdom, Solomon, tells us that everything is vanity which means it'll all end, but he says to 'enjoy' our lives for the time we have under the sun.	2003-04-16

The so-called prophet office seems to be alive and doing well according to his observations and he defends that honestly. A few things to consider though when reading this book. John the Baptist (Elijah) was 'the last prophet' &quot;for all the prophets and the law prophesied until (up to) John.&quot; (parentheses mine - Matt. 11:13) As the author says in the beginning of his book - 'I thought the Bible was enough'! According to the verse I quoted, John was the 'last' prophet and even if there are signs present -we should not look for, what is fast becoming in Christianity - soothsayers. Prophecy is 'revelation' as the beginning of the Book of Revelation states &quot;the revelation of Jesus Christ&quot;. Revelation is simply 'something revealed by God'and true prophecy always points to 'Jesus'(The Bible), not to ourselves. However, the new prophecy today is something entirely different and not prophecy at all but words of knowledge. Jesus 'reveals' Himself to us and gives us understanding of 'the Bible' so we can know prophecy concerning the end times. We shouldn't be looking for 'special information' or we just might conjure up the same spirit Saul did.	2003-04-06

Books	2	17	30	N	N	'Grace' and 'truth' came through Jesus Christ	The author raises some very good questions, however, he is only restating what others have said. In a nutshell he believes the problems in the church of Christ exists because there is a lack of 'grace' being practised. If there is a problem in the church we look for some place to put the blame so we can explain the discrepencies between Christian teaching and Christian behaviour. This, however, puts people on guilt trips as they try, once again, to catch that elusive life of grace. Could it be there is a lack of grace because there is a lack of Christ? Scripture says 'grace' and 'truth' came through Jesus Christ. The two go together, you cannot have grace unless you have truth and visa versa. If there is a lack of 'grace' in the church of Christ, it must be that there is a lack of 'truth'. People's behaviour is based on what they believe is right.

Speaking of 'the end of the world' the author says 'God reserves the right to change His mind'. There are things written in the Bible, specifically concerning the end times of the Revelation to John, that will 'not change'. They are written in stone! Those events will come to pass without fail. No amount of praying or contemplating will change prophetic events spoken of in the Bible. The end of time will come just as foretold in the Scriptures. Christians must be careful, the Bible must be the'only' authority which speaks for God. If we get away from that then we are merely following after what Jesus referred to in the gospels as 'the doctrines of men'.	2003-03-24

If the book follows the exerpts then I would have to say it's not very intellectually stimulating with new ideas. In trying to describe the indescribable, the author equates heaven with things we know of this life and makes it appear very boring. The Bible says that 'we cannot even conceive what heaven will be like'. Heaven is a 'spirit' world of 'immortal beings' - nothing like we've ever seen. Give me a sci-fi book any day that portrays supposedly impossible themes and then you get my interest.	2003-03-19

Eschatology (the main theme of this book) means the study of end times, if you were wondering. And yes, I agree with the author, the entire Bible is eschatologically related. The Book of Revelation is itself a condensed version of the Old Testament writings of the prophets, specifically that wonderful prophet, Isaiah. The author writes a little above the heads of the average person, nevertheless if you want to have your vocabulary on end-times issues enlarged, this appears to be interesting.	2003-03-19

The author appears to be saying that we shouldn't be obsessed about the end-times because people have been predicting the end of the world for some time now. However, something as important as the 'end of time' is bound to cause interest and yes, even hysteria. The interest is 'natural', the hysteria exists because we have no real answers. The Bible has a great deal to say about the end-times, for that reason we should have a good deal of interest in it. I didn't find anything fresh in this author's insights about end-times, he just reiterated (according to the exerpts)what others have already said.	2003-03-19

It's no surprise then that his audience will be other intellectuals. While the author talks over my head, there are many who can appreciate his writing.

The author says 'agree with God even when you're not sure what He's saying'. When you read such you should proceed with caution because that's exactly what a cult would say. As a Christian, Jesus wants us to know everything - how can we follow something vague? God gave human beings a wonderful gift that seems to be dormant in much Christian teaching these days -it's called 'common sense'.	2003-03-16

He seems to say 'seek Godly knowledge but don't dig too deep lest you become conceited'.  All Christians need to 'know' for certain the entire gospel of Christ, how can anyone follow God unless they 'know' exactly what He's saying to us? The Corinthians had a 'wrong' knowledge of God and that's why Paul was admonishing them because they were following 'after men' (wrong knowledge) rather than Christ. The 'knowledge of God' is good and brings humility but the 'commandments of men'corrupts.	2003-03-16

I only read the exerpt but if the entire book follows the message that Christian men are being taught to be just 'nice' but that should not be the 'limit' of his self.  Free expression of being the man God created him to be should be the goal. We are losing the dreams of our childhood 'who we want to be when we grow up' and it's turning Christians into automatons. God is a wonderful 'Creator' - making us all unique but Christianity seems to be propagating the notion that we should all be the same, lose our dreams and become a part of the one. Careful what you are believing people. If this book propogates being true to your true 'self' and believing in God at the same time then read on.	2003-03-16

The author suggests that it's not important that we know 'correct prophetic' information of the Bible but rather it's more important to act 'Christian'. Prophecy is as much a part of the Bible as any other part of the Bible - if we cannot learn the meanings of prophecy then we cannot know the Bible.	2003-03-03

If people and their dreams are not important then God is a poor creator because He made us so 'self' driven. If the purpose of Christianity is to become less ourselves and more God, then God didn't love humanity, he just loves Himself. But we know that's not true, God loves us and has a purpose for everyone's life if we dare reach out and believe Him for greater things. Cults teach people to become 'less themselves' and to embrance a 'higher self'. Christianity is preaching this same thing if I read these pages correctly. I disagree, God loves humanity, even our humanness - that's what He came to perfect.	2003-03-03

He merely puts todays interpretations on yesterdays message. As those living in past Bible times could not understand our times, likewise we cannot understand theirs. For us to try and imagine what it must have been like for early Christians is a poor guess at best. God left us His word to instruct us 'for today' just as He left His word for those Christains living in that day. The Bible speaks just as clearly today as it did yesterday but the message never changes.	2003-03-03
