Each one was like a little gem I could hold in my hand. Orringer's characters are well thought out and each story reads like it could be turned into a novel. Some I thought ended at the perfect point, while others left me begging for more. Highly recommended for fans of short stories, but also recommended to someone who hasn't liked story collections in the past. I think this book could change your mind.	2005-04-29
US	45634801	RLYN8FD0L53RA	0439286034	932563878	Tangerine	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Good pick for reluctant readers	This is shelved in the children's department at my local Barnes & Noble, but I think it leans more towards a teen novel. Some of the situations are pretty violent, though there's nothing too terribly graphic. I would say 11 or 12 and up. This novel tells the story of Paul Fisher, a seventh grade kid who moves with his family to Tangerine County, Florida. It's kind of a creepy place. The development where he lives used to be covered with tangerine groves that slowly went out of business and were cut down. As a result, termites attack the houses, and Paul's school falls into a sinkhole. When he's placed at an alternate school in the lower-class downtown area of Tangerine, he gets placed on the soccer team and makes friends with a bunch of people he never would have met otherwise. It's a fast-paced sports action story with some elements of mystery- just why is Paul's brother Erik so frightening? What happened to Paul to damage his eyes when he was five and why can't he remember it?<br /><br />I really liked this book... a lot more than I thought I would, actually. I think most YA books can be recommended to kids and adults alike, and this novel is no exception. Especially recommended to fans of the book &lt;u>Holes&lt;/u> by Louis Sachar or &lt;u>The Chocolate War&lt;/u> by Robert Cormier.	2005-04-23

It's more of a love story than her other novels, more sappy. I think the image of the moths finding each other by scent in order to mate is one of the most striking images of love that I've ever read, though. Kingsolver's signature style does make its appearances, even in this different kind of book.	2003-04-20

I've found out that they're shelving these books in the adult science fiction section as well as the children's section, which at first seemed wrong, but they are fairly dark and a little graphic with the violence. Nevertheless I have thourougly enjoyed these books. This is the continuing story of Lyra who travels to another world and meets a boy named Will who is looking for his father. It follows their adventures and I personally enjoy this series because of what their war is about. But anyhoo. Go read them.	2002-02-28

It was good. I just finished it a few minutes ago and I almost feel like I need a little while to contemplate it and figure out what it all means. Tyler makes a statement about family life in this story of the Tull family. Beck Tull leaves his wife and three children when his oldest child is 14, I think, and the story takes us through a large portion of each of their lives, switching off perspectives between each of the children and the mother with each chapter. There's so much to the book that it's hard to sum it up in a short paragraph. It makes me want to read more of Anne Tyler's books.	2002-02-28

This book stars Minty Malone, an all-too-nice radio journalist who gets jilted in front of 280 people and must deal with the fact that she let her ex-fiance walk all over her. With laugh-out-loud moments and serious romanticism that all works out in the end (of course) this rather mindless read is a lot of fun.	2002-02-28

I didn't go out last night because I didn't feel well and ended up readign 2/3 of the book in one sitting. It's another one of those British 20-something's autobiographical novel, this time dictating the woes of Rebecca Bloomwood, a financial journalist whose own finances have gone down the garbage chute. She finds herself horribly in debt and tries and tries to remedy the situation, but nothing seems to work. I was afraid when I picked this one up that I wouldn't have sympathy for the main character, but that wasn't a problem. Though Rebecca makes quite a few mistakes and gets herself into quite a few laugh-out-loud funny situations because she's afraid to face her debt, I found myself rooting for her all the way through.	2002-02-28

It seems kind of autobiographical because the author used her own name for the main character, but I'm not sure if it's actually based on her real life or not. This book chronicles Shannon's life and therapy dealing with her lackadaisical approach to life and relationships. She's not happy, but has trouble letting go (hmm... been there, done that). Shannon was for me an immensely likeable heroine and I identified with her relationship struggles (with a man named Michael, coincidentally). This book was excellent, written in a fresh, unusual style. I really enjoyed it.	2002-02-28

It is wonderful. I have read<br />a few Chinese (and other Asian) memoirs and this is one of the (if not THE) best ones I've read. This poignant memoir details<br />Adeline's life from when she was born and her mother died to when her tyrannical step-mother Niang dies. This book moved me<br />to tears on more than one occasion. Adeline went through such hardship, but she managed to triumph over adversity and make<br />her life a success despite the horrible treatment she received from her family. Despite all the abuse and abandonment she felt<br />Adeline still knows how to love and how to transform that love into written words. This is an excellent memoir and a must-read,<br />especially if you are into the memoir genre.	2002-02-28

It was wonderful. It tells the story of Ruby Lee, a Chinese-American girl who moves back in with her parents in Queens after graduating from college in order to save up enough money to get her own place. Ruby struggles with her parents' loveless marriage and trying to &quot;save&quot; her mother from what she sees as an impossible situation, while at the same time trying to deal with a boyfriend she doesn't love, and finding the motivation to go to work each day.	2002-02-28

How's the for some &quot;p&quot; words? I enjoyed it and Chaudhuri does have an eloquent turn of phrase, but I'm still kind of wondering what the point was. It seemed more like snapshots of the lives of Indian families than actual novellas. Freedom Song is a collection of three novellas: A Strange and Sublime Address, An Afternoon Raag, and Freedom Song. I dunno... maybe they're all just too smart for me (that is entirely possible).	2002-02-28

Nash was awarded the Nobel prize in economics in 1994 for his contributions to game theory. He also suffered from schizophrenia. Of course as a psych major I am intrigued by the stigma associated with mental disorder that is prevalent in this book. Nash did most of his work in the 50s and 60s. We still don't know very much about mental disorders and people knew even less when Nash was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Although this book is occasionally dry with talk about specific mathematic equations and technical theories, you don't need to understand all that stuff to really enjoy the book. I loved it. I saw the movie first, which was definitely a good thing because the book and the movie are a lot different. Although the movie strays quite a bit from the actual facts and events of Nash's life, I think it still captures the essence of his experiences and portrays him as the &quot;crazy&quot; genius that he was.	2002-02-28

I first heard of her in the Best American Short Stories where she had a story published. I really liked it, so I decided to check out more of her works. All of the stories are beautifully written, if a little depressing. I especially liked the series of Jessie stories that she included. This book won the Iowa Short Fiction Award in 1999, which is really prestigious (though I didn't know it before.. I mean, c'mon.. IOWA?? What are you going to write about?! Cows?

I first read Jin in a volume of Best American short stories. Three of the stories in The Bridegroom have been chosen for editions of that wonderful series. The stories are well written, but tend to have kinda chopped-off ends. They each read like they could be the beginning of a novel, which might be why I think they all end too soon. It's amazing to see the differences between Communist China and capitalist America presented in these stories by a man who has lived in both places.	2002-02-28

I think they're all excellent ways of tasting some of the best writing that comes out of America each year. Short stories have long been a favourite of mine and I find every year the Best American Short Stories are a joy to read. Not only are short stories perfect for modern American society where one rarely has time to sit down and finish a novel in a decent enough amount of time to remember the beginning when one reaches the end (as guest editor Kingsolver points out in her introduction), but these are the creme de la creme. Kingsolver did a wonderful job at picking them. I enjoyed every single one of them, some more than others of course, and I always come away with a list of books to check out (each author represented in the collection has a short bio and listing of works in the back of the book)... I definitely recommend this and the other Best American Short Stories books to everyone.	2002-02-28

If I'd have known how good it was going to be, I certainly would have read it sooner!! It's a children's fantasy book and somewhat reminded me of Harry Potter, though it's not about the same thing. I would definitely recommend this series (there are two other books in the 'His Dark Materials' series that I haven't read yet, but will soon) for the Harry Potter lover in your life. It's a bit darker than Harry Potter, but draws you in just the same. It's a magical world of daemons and armored bears, of gyptians and witches. I'd describe it to you, but I really can't do it justice. Just trust me and read it. Five out of five stars. Oh.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by reading Pullman's other (wonderful, amazing) trilogy first, but it was alright. Definitely nowhere near the His Dark Materials trilogy, but we'll read the other books before we judge the trilogy, eh? This is the story of Sally Lockhart, a very capable young woman in Victorian England. Her father dies and Sally finds herself wrapped up in a mystery she knows it's up to her to solve. Sally's a likeable character and she has likeable sidekick people like Frederick the photographer and Jim the errand boy guy. Eh, it was alright.	2002-02-28

This collection of short stories is excellent... most of them were really, really good. And they were pretty short. To qualify for the contest your story had to be under 7500 words, so that makes it easy to read one or two in between classes or whenever you have a spare moment (definitely appealing to me). I really enjoyed this book... I want to read the first one, but I'm not allowing myself to buy any more books. I have plenty on my &quot;to-read&quot; list here. My favourite of the bunch was probably &quot;Sushi&quot; by Heather Swain, but it's hard to pick a favourite because so many were good.	2002-02-28

Maybe after the last one it was just too exciting to have a book with a plot... It's set in a small Missouri town in 1960-61 and told from the point of view of Charlie, the youngest child in a family of three children. The children, especially the middle child Graceanne, endure horrible abuse at the hands of their mother (who was abused by their father before she divorced him and got kicked out of the Catholic church... Hmmm...) but their courage and humour in dealing with it is really amazing. The characters were touching, the imagery is magnifique, the book played out like it was a movie. I loved the characters and rooted for them all the way through the book. It's great.	2002-02-28

I get bored with the same old characters and the sometimes amazing twists and turns the author takes to keep the story going for another book or two. His Dark Materials blew my mind, frankly. The first book was wonderful and they actually kept getting better. I seriously can't recommend these books enough. They're imaginative and I adore all the characters...I'm pretty sure that there's a deep philosophical truth underneath it all if only I could spare the time to ponder it. Five out of five stars for the whole series. Buy this one for your family and friends.	2002-02-28

This is a true story, a documented case of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder). It's the actual manuscript that Truddi and her 90+ personalities composed during months of therapy. It is excellent. I thought Sybil was good (and it is, you should read that, too), but I liked WRH even more. I admit, I read it for my psych class. We have to do a book report type thing on a psychology book of our choice. But I felt like I was cheating when I read it and said that I was studying because it really didn't feel like work. Go read this book. It's good, I promise.	2002-02-28
