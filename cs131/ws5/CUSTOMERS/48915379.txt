First, I have been to Alaska so I know what it is like up there, and for that reason alone I find the book captivating. But also, I know what it is like to not be able to forget about a former lover. I can understand that. I can feel that. I know that love is real for the power that is consumptive is love in the finest degree. Mostly I think back to what obsessions are and the obsession of one for another is not in and of itself bad, but for all intents and purposes an obsession can be bad if it makes another person uncomfortable. I hope that this is never the case.	2002-02-23
