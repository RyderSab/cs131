I was dismayed. How was it possible that this book was on display - in paperback, mind you - when I'd been scanning New York bookshops for months in the desperate hope that Wurts' latest piece of art might be on display? I'm much enlightened by another reviewer's comments that some artwork discrepancy is holding off publication in the US; hence the discrepancy. I was worried that perhaps the popularity of Ms. Wurts' books are declining. Or maybe they are?<br /><br />Many of my feelings about Traitor's Knot mirror that of other reviewers. The writing itself was the biggest obstacle. The language throughout the book is so complex and the sentence structure so archaic that it takes away from depth of the plot and intrigue of the story. I often had to re-read passages not just twice but three or four times to figure out what exactly had just happened. I will admit that perhaps the fault lies partly with me for not concentrating hard enough on the reading, but it appears I wasn't alone in this battle.<br /><br />Yet, this installment of the series had some very strong plus points. It's not merely a reworking of the same plot that leads to warfare and mass murder, with Arithon feeling profoundly saddened and guilty and Lysaer feeling only rage through misguided judgment. Rather, this version has a true forward momentum in character development and plot. The characters grow, and twist. Arithon re-awakens to his gift and learns to manipulate his skills more finely and control the curse that affect him and his half-brother. Lysaer awakens to the reality of necromancers, but remains unable to shake the Mistwraith Curse. Arithon merrily evades Koriani traps by learning to control iyats that he later uses for his own amusement.<br /><br />And perhaps most widely anticipated: Arithon and Elaira are finally encounter each other in an-almost-sex-scene. The latter, in all honesty, is quite painful and embarrassing but also, in my mind, the most brilliantly written part of the book.<br /><br />Not only that, but we learn a bit more about the worlds of sorcerers, Davien the Betrayer and the deeper mysteries of Athera. Still, many loose ends remain: the roles of the clans, Fionn Areth, Elaira, the twins and Sulfin Evend are left open for future volumes.<br /><br />Wurts teeters on the dangerous edge of losing her audience amongst the sheer number of plots and characters, and overly verbose writing. I felt like I was blundering through the book with a blindfold on, that occasionally slipped off and lent me a peek of current events. Instead of wrapping her audience in shadow, Ms. Wurts might better lead us with an elegantly crisp melody. For it would be a shame to lose a dedicated audience when, after all, Wurts has a talent for both plot and character development strengthened with a strong sense of comedic timing. And, judging from her other books, a palpable gift for writing.are finally encounter each other in an-almost-sex-scene.

US	49464433	R3O6CZQW7VEC3L	1400063833	97937991	Until I Find You: A Novel	Books	5	6	10	N	N	A Monet amongst garbage	The brilliance of Irvin's books has always been his talent for entertaining interjections (not too many John - never that) within what is, upon reflection, a tale of a pathetic central character. Irvin's characters are inevitably full of flaws, embedded in their pasts, with a knack of getting into desperate situations they are powerless to control. They live surreal lives - far more interesting than they themselves are. And it's not until they learn that their environment does not control them, that they can take their psychological hick-ups in hand and begin life as normal human beings.<br /><br />This latest Irvin book, then, is no different. Fans of Irvin will hear the echo of familiar themes: molestation, infatuation with older (or heavier) women, single-parenthood, wrestling, penile obsession ... And familiar places: Amsterdam (the red light district), Toronto, New England ... But also some new ones. This book features Alice, a tattoo artist, William, an organist, and their son Jack Burns, an actor; LA, Oslo, Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen ...<br /><br />Irvin is an artist. In a world full of modern and frivolous canvasses, he paints a Monet. The painstakingly dotted detail paints a masterpiece whole. He can't help it. Neither can Jack Burns. Jack is defined by the oddities, the blobs, the layers of paint that don't appear to make much sense close up. But when viewed from a distance, it is clear that each little blob connects to the others and make up his life. And how do you go about changing a Monet once it's been painted? Could you do without the pink, orange and green in a yellow flower? Of course not. It wouldn't be a Monet anymore!<br /><br />Irvin has his own distinctive voice in modern literature; one that is somewhat reminiscent of Dickens - or so I've been told by those who know about these things. Personally, I associate Irvin's work much more with the magic realism found in Latin American literature. The things that obsess Irvin are the themes so often revisited. But in each book, the themes are seen from a different angle, a different depth. I do not find it at all disturbing; in fact, it's something that I've come to *expect*. If it were missing, it would not be an Irvin book.<br /><br />Make no mistake. The story of Jack Burns is highly original. His mother Alice traipses him around Europe when he's only four years old in what he's been told is a last ditch attempt to find his father William. Alice pays for their journey by tattooing people all over Scandinavia and northern Europe (or so we believe), much in the way that she colors Jack's world. Upon their return to Canada, Jack is raised in a school full of girls believing his father doesn't want him. Older girls and women are unnecessarily cruel to him, giving them a false power over him. The lack of male influence in his life leaves a lasting impression as he grows up to become an actor.<br /><br />Jack's view of the world has been heavily tainted by his mother's influence. As he grows away from her when he gets older, he never thinks to question it. But when he becomes aware that his mother has kept her breast cancer secret from him for years, he begins to wonder what else she hasn't told him. Once he opens the door to that question, Jack's world changes drastically.<br /><br />I find this book carries a much more melancholy undertone than any of Irvin's other work. Perhaps it is because the main theme is so personal to Irvin. This book lacks some of the truly funny action seen in Irvin's other novels. I quite like the fact that this one's different; sadder. Maybe it's because I've matured that I see this work in a more pessimistic light. We all carry some amount of baggage - or garbage as I like to call it.

With this book, Penrose founded what's known as the resource-based view. Essentially, she determined that there must be something inside the firm that drives its growth (i.e. success).<br /><br />The author explores the reasons for such growth. Penrose moves away from the neoclassical economics model of the firm towards a definition of the firm as one that has administrative responsibilities (strategic planning or management) and a view of the firm as a collection of resources (human resources, technologies and other capabilities a firm has). She argues that choice of how those resources are put to use is central to a firms \\"entrepreneurial\\" activity.<br /><br />Penrose goes on to say that change and growth of firms must be driven from inside the  firm because the economy as a whole does not constrain firms. Managers, she says, know that they can alter their environment, and that the environment is not independent of their activities.<br /><br />The resources that are available within firms are ever changing, of course, and often come together in bundles. This means that there are always some resources that are not being used, or being used inefficiently. Managers who realise this can develop those resources and grow their companies as a result. Thus, it is knowledge in combination with resources that drives growth. This is also what makes each firm unique: there are hundreds of ways to combine those resources, and each firm does it differently.<br /><br />The book then talks about how growth takes place - sometimes as part of a diversification process or through an acquisition or merger. Penrose also discusses the role of time, and the difference between a small or a larger company growing. Growth, she concludes is possible for all firms - size does not necessarily mean that a firm is more efficient (which is the typical economic argument). The only thing that constrains growth, really, is the limited capacity we humans have for managing a lot of change at once.<br /><br />The style of writing is conversational, if somewhat dated. The only slight drawback is that Penrose often returns to hammer on the same point. But that's not unusual for this type of book. The most astonishing aspect by far is that Edith Penrose was a woman, in a world of business and academia that then, and still now, consists largely of men.pical economic argument).

As Harry gets older, and Voldemort gets stronger, each book in the series has become a bit more dark. We are no closer to solving the mystery, but we get a few more clues and a bit more insight into the things Harry Potter just couldn't possibly know. Harry's growth through his teens is linked to his growing understanding of the issues at hand, and its serious implications for both the Wizard and Muggle worlds.<br /><br />Rowling paints a complex picture. In each book, more elements come into play and this one is no exception. Some characters seem to be getting what they want most out of life - Professor Snape finally gets to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts. We ask ourselves why Dumbledore would allow this after resisting Snape's request to teach this class for so many years. What has changed Dumbledore's mind?<br /><br />And Harry does not learn most of his new tricks and magic in the DADA class this year. Instead, the new Potions professor unwittingly hands him a precious treasure and a deadly weapon. The question is, does Harry really know what he's getting into?<br /><br />Even Draco is not entirely himself this year. Always up to no good, he seems to have lost his enthusiasm for school and is moving towards bigger (but perhaps not better) things. It's to be expected that Draco would be a bit weird - after all, his father is in Azkaban.<br /><br />Of course, some things never change. The Weasley twins have made an enterprise out of their passion for sick jokes. Ron and Hermione still pretend they don't care for each other. And Harry's responsibilities towards Quidditch are now tremendous. With all that's going on around them, it's surprising the teenagers have time to live a normal life.<br /><br />Rowling's talent for writing, and her skill at combining a multi-layered mystery with fantasy are more evident than ever in this book. It would be difficult not to finish *The Half Blood Prince* in one sitting.It would be difficult not to finish *The Half Blood Prince* in one sitting.	2005-07-25

Feist tells the story of a mountain boy, Kieli, who has become the man Talon of the Silver Hawk. As he makes his way down the mountain to celebrate this feat with his family, he finds that his village is being slaughtered by outsiders. Determined to stand and fight like a man, Talon's boyish attempt are futile against those on horseback with crossbows. He is shot down and left for dead.<br /><br />As fate would have it, Talon is picked up by some men who bring him to an inn. He owes these men his life and vows that he will avenge his family and race who've been obliterated. But Talon has much to learn. He does not know who has attacked his family, though he clearly remembers their faces. He doesn't even really know much about his new friends. He is only a mountain boy, but his friends provide him with the skills he needs to survive in civilized Midkemia. Not only will he need to learn about the Games of Men, he also has to learn about the games of men and women, politics, music, sword skills, and even a bit about magic.<br /><br />Left without a race and little to live for except vengeance, Talon is shaped and molded by the Shadow of the Conclave - a tool to be used for their own purposes. But Talon's ambitions and the Conclave's have similar ends. Talon takes on the role of a minor noble and becomes the best swordsman in the kingdom. Only then can he put his skills to the test and hunt down those that destroyed his kind.<br /><br />In this book, Feist has once again captured the trials of childhood and coming of age. Shaped by external events, Talon becomes a character with a thirst for vengeance, but who does not yet fully understand the consequences of his actions - something he will need to learn in order to finally enter manhood. The turmoil and confusion of a teenager that has faced traumatic experiences leave their scars on Talon. As a result, he is more malleable and shaped into a weapon. His vision is narrow, yet, he becomes more and more aware of the world around him. Will vengeance always be his fuel? What will Talon do once his goals are achieved? What will he live for then. These questions are beyond the boy; issues to be fleshed out when he grows to maturity in the second book of the series.<br /><br />I've once again fallen in love with Feist and his natural talent. The book is fast-paced, with plenty of action and adventure and natural dialogue. Integrated into it are some of my favorite Midkemian characters. The plot is a page-turner. Feist's skill for character development shines through, for who could not sympathize with Talon of the Silver Hawk?<br /><br />It was Magician that first captured my love for Feist.

The city is the center of commerce and trade, open to all. It is a young clans man, Temrai, who comes up with the clever idea of entering the city as a sword-maker. He spends several months there, working his trade, while at the same time gathering information of every aspect of the city's defense system - he is even invited to read about ancient techniques on how the city might be defeated, forgotten by most, in the city library. When his father dies, Temrai becomes the new clan chief. He leads his clan in a crazy attack on the city in the name of a personal vendetta. His target is one Bardas Loredan.<br /><br />Loredan, a fencer, a defender of the law, with a military past, is beginning to realize he might be getting too old for the dangerous profession. Without much enthusiasm he begins a fencing school but before his first students can graduate, he is commanded by the city council to take command of what passes for an army, and check out what is going on in the plains - reports have been coming in that the clans are starting to build heavy artillery, an unexpected turn for a group of people who have never cared for engineering. Loredan is caught between defending the city and the politics of the place, one day a hero, the next a villain. In a bizarre turn of events he finds himself alternately running the place or being in jail.<br /><br />At the same time, the Patriarch who claims that magic does not exist begins to have bad headaches and ill health after implementing a curse against Loredan without really knowing what he is doing. And he keeps bumping into other people that seem to be naturals in the ways of the Principle (but not magical) forces without knowing what they're doing.<br /><br />The story of the fall of Permadeia is a strange one, with many tendrils sticking out here and there. Much of the plot is unfinished, except for a simple though bizarre story of revenge. At the end of the book, we are left with too many loose ends, and an out-of-the way ending.<br /><br />It is clear that Parker indeed practices what he preaches when he says that character is more important than story, for the characters are thoroughly developed while the story leaves something to be desired. The result is that believable characters move through the story with unbelievable motives. All in all, the book could do with some plot development. Further, much of the boring details on how trebuchets are constructed and how swords are made could be edited out. Perhaps Parker has missed his calling - he might very ably complete a PhD specialising in medieval weaponry and artillery.<br /><br />Certain not the \\"action-packed adventure\\" promised by the Starburst review on the back.

If I had to name one awe-inspiring book that I've read in the past year, it would without doubt be *Speed of Dark*. I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Moon's writing and this book has shown me how truly impressive it is. She has managed to tackle an extremely difficult, complex topic in a light and readable way without compromising the heavy-hearted subject matter of autism that affects the main character Lou.<br /><br />Moon's work enlightened me to the world of autism; how it can vary from person to person; how autistic people might see the world; how \\"my\\" way of seeing the world doesn't necessarily make all that much sense. It brought home to me that we make so many assumptions about our everyday life that get us through basic things, without ever realizing that these assumptions might be so very difficult for others to comprehend. In  way, I've come to see autism as another \\"culture\\". I see it a bit as going to a different country, where you might feel lost because you've missed some social cues and you cannot understand the language so there is no way to know what's going on unless someone spells it out for you. It's been so delightful to read a book about this culture of autistics.<br /><br />And not just any book. Of course, you can always pick up some dry medical manual or \\"about\\" book if you want to know about something like autism. But such books do not give you the true feel, the real insight, the everyday life. In *Speed of Dark*, Moon has created not only a new world, but also realistic characters with whom a reader can empathize. Readers see the world in a wholly new way. And in parts of it, we recognize ourselves. Do you, for example, cut out all your shirt labels because they irritate? Do you always sit in the same seat in a restaurant or other familiar place?<br /><br />The most stunning aspect of this book is how \\"right\\" Lou is about everything. In a world that is different, Lou underpins the silliness of humanity and society. Lou gains those things he values in life by not saying what he means, but saying what others want to hear. Lou decides that when he can't think of anything to say in the circumstances, but people are waiting, he just says \\"thank you\\". It works. He is told that he is not normal, but from his point of view, \\"normal\\" people appear to be very much insane. How often do we mold ourselves to social graces, when what we really want to do is shut out the rest of the world? I don't that there is much difference at all between a \\"normal\\" person and an autistic person. In fact, I'm beginning to think that autistic people may have a more accurate view of the world.<br /><br />Lou's very organized life becomes disrupted by some unusual things - someone slashes his car tires, he enters a fencing competition, and a new experimental treatment is developed to cure autism. Lou faces the biggest decision of his life with the latter option. He's always dreamed of working in space, something that was never possible because he is autistic. This is one of the main draws to the new treatment. But the way his company goes about things is hardly ethical. Lou and his other autistic coworkers eventually begin to figure this out. They become a force to be reckoned with, and finally are able to face a free choice of whether or not to go ahead with the treatment.<br /><br />This story is full of heart and soul. It is, above all, a beautifully written story and a delight to read. It has enlightened my life. It's worthy of some big award. But really, it should become one of those classic required literature readings for everybody.he values in life by not saying what he means, but saying what others want to hear.

But as time progressed, something appeared not quite right. There are dark forces in Erna that react to human's fears and desires which can be banished only by sunlight, or by the force of powerful will. One man appears to have the answer, but political forces will not allow him to gain control. He does the unthinkable ... sacrificing his humanity for eternal life and power.<br /><br />Ten thousand years have passed and, still, humans battle against these dark forces. The teachings of the Prophet remain in the Church which traditionally rejects the notion that the fae can be manipulated through sorcery. No one walks the streets at night, and during true night because when darkness is complete and none of Erna's three moons are present, the dark fae dominate the world. As does the Hunter.<br /><br />Some branches of the Church have trained their own sorcerers based on faith and healing powers. One man, Damien, epitomizes this faith. Natural adepts walk the world freely, but are often insane. One woman, Ciani, is the unbiased loremaster manipulates the fae effortlessly. Her assistant Senzei hungers for this power. So do others.<br /><br />When fate throws Damien, Ciani and Senzei together and Ciani's memories are leeched from her, priest, adept and apprentice have no choice but to take back what belongs to Ciani. They pursue their quest beyond human lands into unknown territory. But their quest reaches deeper than they can imagine and is adopted by another: one that is no longer human. Can the priest accept the aid of pure evil to accomplish the task? Can Senzei resist the hunger for power? Will Ciani be able to retrieve her memory?<br /><br />Friedman's story reaches the darkest places of a human soul and balances on the edge of uncomfortable heroes. Exquisite.	2005-02-21
US	49464433	R150HKZHN7ME5H	006057528X	457745649	The Magicians' Guild (The Black Magician Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Raw and Needs Editing	I agree with the opinion of other reviewers that \\"The Magician's Guild\\" lacks enough material to make for a book (and the rest of the story is not enough to make a trilogy). This work is, and reads like, a first-time novel for a debuting author. Canavan has restricted herself to staying within the generally accepted and widely used boundaries of fantasy work: medievalism, magicians and thieves.<br /><br />The story is a coming-of-age of Sonea, a slum girl who accidentally unleashes her magical powers when she and a group of friends try to obstruct the work of the Magician's Guild who are purging all the poor from the city. They throw rocks that bounce off the invisible barrier held up by the magicians. Except that Sonea's rock gets through when she wills it to, and strikes the temple of Lord Fergun.<br /><br />Mass confusion ensues among the magicians, and they end up accidentally killing a boy standing near Sonea. Sonea herself is confused by what's happened to her. She runs and hides from the magicians who have identified her magical potential. The problem is, the longer she hides, the less controllable her magic becomes and the more destruction she creates to those around her. Even the Thieves are unable to protect her. Inevitably, Sonea ends up at the Magician's Guild.<br /><br />The book tells the tale of how Sonea ends up at the Guild, and her apprenticeship. The plot focuses around the High Lord (the one that rules the Guild), whom Sonea accidentally observes practicing black magic. She and a few others who know about this, lie in wait but know that eventually they must do something about the High Lord. Meanwhile, Sonea is often troubled by Regis, a school bully, since she is the only slum girl in a school full of upper class students.<br /><br />The details of Sonea's tough existence, frankly, are boring. This book comes in two parts, but in my opinion, they needed to be edited down to a quarter of a book. Books two and three could have formed the rest of the book. As one piece, the work would have been snazzy, snappy and sweet.

Or is it a different one? Kylara finally makes her way to Lastway, the originally scheduled final stop for her commercial carrier when she receives disturbing news of attacks on her homeland and on Vatta Transport and the family. But unfortunately, the communication ansibles have been knocked out and she is playing in the dark. Her military training is what spurts her to take the offensive, and even though she does not yet know who the enemy is, she begins to prepare her commercial ship for war time defense. Yet, she struggles to balance her financial and is constantly interrupted by attempts made on her life.<br /><br />And then, totally unexpectedly, her cousin, Stella shows up. The \\"bimbo blonde\\" who gave the family codes to her first lover and is generally viewed as useless by the family. Except that Kylara realizes that Stella, much like herself, has been pigeonholed by the family and underneath the bubblehead, there is a sophisticated spy who has been working for the Vatta family business for years. Stella has brought along partners, Rafe and the young Vatta cousin, Toby; and the terrible news that both of Kylara's parents and Stella's parents have perished in the attacks.<br /><br />Kylara quickly makes use of her new resources and launches a serious mission that entails survival of her ship and crew, saving Vatta family members, and identifying and removing the enemy. Except that they still have no idea who the enemy is. Rafe, whose background is as obscure as Stella's, provides some clues. And Kylara gains an unexpected ally when a mercenary force offers its services to her ... for a small fee: trade and profit.<br /><br />All her allies have secrets, but so does Kylara herself. Someone she knew at the academy sends her an unusual package, the contents of which could help, but also hinder, Kylara's mission. And she has yet to divulge to her friends how she feels about killing people.<br /><br />In all, this second book in the series matches the first for characterization and plot. It's slow moving at the beginning, but the second half of the book picks up pace quickly, like its predecessor. Circumstances twist so that the heroine is forced in a direction that leaves few choices. Kylara is a likeable, yet not perfect, heroine. She makes mistakes, some of them deadly, but lands on her feet in the end, earning respect from her peers and readers alike.<br /><br />As with all of Moon's books, this work makes for an enjoyable read.ends how she feels about killing people.  <br /> <br />In all, this second book in the series matches the first for characterization and plot.

He accompanies Shigeru back to his home, meeting some interesting people along the way, whose importance Takeo only realizes later on. Once at Shigeru's home, Takeo learns the ways of the Otori household, is trained in reading and writing and sword fighting skills, and eventually adopted as a son by Shigeru.<br /><br />Meanwhile, far away, a young girl, Kaede, is held hostage and treated like a servant by the enemy, even though her own family is rich and powerful. That way, alliances and cooperation of the family are ensured. Kaede becomes too much of a handful, however, when she is the cause of the death of a man, and then almost immediately, a second. It is decided she will be sent away to marry to further alliances for Iida. Her marriage is to be to Shigeru Otori. But her reputation precedes her.<br /><br />Shigeru, although agreeing to the marriage, sees this as an opportunity to force his enemy's hand, and the story follows the twists and turns of plotting and counterplotting between the Otori Clan and its enemies.<br /><br />And, as Takeo grows up, it becomes clear that his talents lie in another direction altogether.<br /><br />\\"Nightingale\\" is simply astonishing. It is skillful in its simplicity of prose, and intrigue of plot. It captures the feeling of feudal Japan exquisitely, through the creation of realistic characters and beautiful settings. The tone of the book is somewhat similar to that of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" in its Japanese-ness. This work stands out from both fiction and fantasy, and deserves every credit it has been given.out from both fiction and fantasy, and deserves every credit it has been given.	2004-10-14

Nevertheless, this book manages to do just that.<br /><br />Schumacker and Lomax have successfully put together a guide that explains to beginners (like myself) in simple terms how the whole thing works. As with most books that treat complex models, some basic knowledge of statistics is preferable before you begin to read it. But if your statistics is rusty and you have only vague impressions of probability sketches in your memory, fear not! Schumacker and Lomax are kind to us poor souls, and begin by introducing some basics in chapter 1 to prod your memory: terminology, variable scales, how to treat missing data, outliers and normality. And in chapter 2, they discuss correlation and covariance.<br /><br />Before talking about structural equation models, Schumacker and Lomax dedicate chapter 3 to a number of statistical methods on which SEM is built. This chapter gives a basic overview of regression, path analysis and factor analysis. The review of these methods helps you to understand SEM better later on. They also provide an excellent understanding of the methods, in case you have not used them before or it's been a while ...<br /><br />The rest of the guide covers SEM: how to develop and measure a model (chapters 4 and 5), how the model parameters are estimated and how you can check for reliability and validity (chapter 6), and checking for goodness of fit of your model (chapter 7).<br /><br />In chapter 8, you are shown some examples of computer outputs by two software packages that can conduct SEM, EQS5 and LISREL8-SIMPLIS.<br /><br />Chapter 9 goes into more detail on models and diagrams (regression, analysis of covariance, path, measurement and structural models). For those that feel by this point that they've gained enough experience, advanced topics such as cross validation, simulation, bootstrap and jacknife methods as well as multiple same and interaction models are covered in chapter 10. And for the super-keen, the technical bits are covered in chapter 11 (health warning: you better be up to speed on matrix algebra).<br /><br />The great thing about this book is that you most likely will be able to run models and interpret results by chapter 7, and you don't need to go into the nitty-gritty if you don't want to. On the other hand, the details are there if you need them. In essence, the authors start at the beginning, building up slowly until you are able to handle a basic model, before going into more complex issues.<br /><br />One drawback, I have found, is that this book was published in 1996. That's nearly a decade ago, and (fortunately) computer power and statistical modeling has come a long way since then. The authors, for example, are convinced that WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing and that at some point in the future it would be possible to copy and paste diagrams into a word processing program. We've come a long way since then. Today, many SEM packages exist that are much more user friendly than some of the older stodgy packages that require you to enter data in a very specific way and interpret results by going through reams of data output. As such, the authors (or publishers) probably ought to update it with a second edition.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the strength of the book lies in its guidance and explanatory power. And even if you use a different package, you can skim through the data outputs they use, and focus on your model, how to construct it, and of what pitfalls to beware.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone starting on SEM - your modeling days will be much happier with this guide.methods as well as multiple same and interaction models are covered in chapter 10.

Jacqueline Cary matches Robert Jordan and Tad Williams in sheer number of pages and characters, and a political by-play to equal Melanie Rawn's Exile's series (who also has a lot of pages). She also isn't the first to jazz up fantasy with erotic episodes (for that, read Jean M. Auel who also writes lots of pages).<br /><br />And on top of it all, Carey displays tremendous originality - a world loosely based on old age France, the Roman empire and the barbaric northern races, but layered with its own history, philosophy, mysticism and love of ... well, love.<br /><br />Our heroine, Phedre no Delaunay, is a high class courtesan, trained to be a spy by Terre D'Ange's most respected \\"spider\\" (spy master), Anafiel. Phedre and her counterpart, Alcuin, are played by Anafiel as pawns. Using their skills as \\"entertainers\\" they accept assignations from patrons influential among elite society to uncover elements of a plot unknown to anyone but the spy master.<br /><br />Whereas Alcuin is every woman's (or man's) dream come true of sweet, pure, innocent love, Phedre is cursed to be a masochist who can only find pleasure in pain. Her patrons are somewhat more obscure than Alcuins, but between them they unwittingly uncover elements of a plot that fit together neatly as a game of chess - all the more dangerous to the spies, as one of Anafiel's counterparts, Melisande, begins to move her pieces.<br /><br />All of these elements set the stage for what could be a truly stunning piece of fantasy writing. Nevertheless, something is lacking. The elements are there, but the sum does not equal to all of the parts. And it is difficult to pinpoint just exactly what the problem is.<br /><br />Perhaps the lack is due to the somewhat limiting perspective of the heroine's first person point of view and her lackadaisical story telling. Readers follow Phedre's story, and it takes some time for all pieces of the puzzle to fall into place. And yet, even when they do, the revelations do not appear that original or extraordinary. They don't even seem to be so unusual to Phedre, judging from her tone of voice.<br /><br />Phedre's life and world are undoubtedly different, and have a certain mystic appeal. Yet, the elements don't seem to flow. The reality of Phedre's life jars with the reality of her surrounding world, giving the book something of the surreal. The reader cannot quite dispense belief properly.<br /><br />It appears to me that in searching for the holy grail of fantasy books Carey has tried to implement too many unusuals, and the outcome is a court jester's apparel rather than a magic carpet..

US	49464433	RXN26EUPGKD73	0886778964	579829556	Valor's Choice (Valor Novel)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Action filled and past-paced	I must say that I have become very taken with Tanya Huff's novels, and her first sci-fi series, beginning with \\"Valor's Choice\\" is delivered with strength, skill and humour.<br /><br />The book opens with Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr waking up in an unfamiliar room, having had a little too much pheromone from one of the ever-willing di'Taykan. In a hangover-like state, Torin is requested to meet her captain an hour earlier than expected and finds a two-star general waiting in the captain's office. She is commissioned to put together an honour-guard for what seems to be an easy and nonsense diplomatic mission, which will be led by a newly graduated Second Lieutenant di'Ka Jarret. Not only is Jarret the mystery person she woke up next to that morning, she will also be responsible for training him whilst pulling together Marines from a well-deserved break so that they can travel to the world of Silviss in an attempt to get the world to join the Confederation in the battle against the Others.<br /><br />As most of the Confederation worlds consist of non-aggressive species, it is up to Humans, di'Taykans and Krai who make up the Marines, to put their best foot forward. But the Silviss are strange; their culture is to test the mettle of others through fighting skills. It soon turns out that drills and standing guard lead to boredom within the troops and a not-so-unexpected bar fight leads to more serious consequences. The Marines find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere, facing thousands of adolescent Silviss.<br /><br />The book has a good pace, following the main character, Staff Sergeant Kerr, who is likeable but tough, and popular with the troops. She takes no nonsense from superiors and is firm with her training of the new Second Lieutenant, keeping her relationship strictly professional, of course. But when things get heavy, will the Lieutenant be able to pull it off? And how do you hold off a thousand aggressive species with only 30 or so Marines and a couple of civilians who refuse to fight?<br /><br />Huff has a talent for writing fun, intriguing novels with strong main characters. Her imaginations goes deep, as evidenced by the development of the species' characteristics, and the action is plentiful. The only drawback is that some of the characters are not properly built up, so it is difficult to emphasize with the peripheral characters, and they are tricky to keep apart.<br /><br />All in all, thoroughly enjoyable for just what it is: an action filled military sci-fi novel.a couple of civilians who refuse to fight? <br /> <br />Huff has a talent for writing fun, intriguing novels with strong main characters.

It is full of scientific, political and economic consequences of human settlement on Mars, and arguments from both sides are presented in detail through the opposing perspectives of different characters within the book. In addition, the book is full of symbolism, such as the &quot;elevator&quot; that is built, only to be pulled down by the hands of the revolution destroying much of the Martian surface and dispersing humans in a manner that made me think of the Tower of Babel.<br />The story begins on a spaceship of the &quot;first hundred&quot; people that are off to begin life on Mars. All of them are scientists, which of course makes for a less than complete representation of human kind, although full of intellectualism and nutty personalities. The mission is meant to be representative of the world's nationalities, dominated by American and Russian teams. Each group of scientists have their own tasks, whether it is flying the space craft, cultivating food, construction once on Mars, ecologists to study Mars, terraformers, biologists, physicists, and even a psychologist.<br />The 8 month journey to Mars is enough to drive some people crazy, and Maya, the Russian leader thinks that she is hallucinating when she unwittingly spots a man whom she does not know onboard the spacecraft. People develop relationships and hatreds, and their true personalities start to come out after hiding most of their peculiarities from the selection committee to be able to go to Mars.<br />Robinson follows different characters for each part of the book, and this makes it a more interesting and in-depth read, as we get different viewpoints on how the people see Mars and what they want from the planet. Some, like Ann, oppose its terraforming, whilst others, such as Sax, can think of nothing but. Hiroko suddenly disappears with a small group of the first hundred and no-one can find them. John and Frank hit heads about how the planet should be run, and one day John is murdered - a shock to everyone.<br />Politics starts to play an important role as the first hundred decide they will do whatever they want on Mars rather than be controlled by Earth. They are free. Only, they really aren't. Before they know it, waves of immigrants from Earth, sponsored by transnational corporations begin to live on the planet. But Mars is not its own nation and does not have a cohesive political or police structure. Problems quickly rise to a peak and the first hundred realise they are no longer in control.<br />A revolution begins and is chaotic and uncontrollable. Infrastructure collapses as it is sabotaged. Finally, Nadia the engineer, after finding out that her lover Arkady who began the revolution has been killed by it, decides that enough is enough and she blows up Phobos in an attempt to stop Earth and transnational control and interference. The first hundred realise that they will be seen as ringleaders of the revolution and that they must escape - will they be rescued by Hiroko's detachment?<br />The book is so complete and full of facts that it is a must for anyone with a passion for Mars and science. It is also a must for those that would think to colonize Mars in the future - as a guide of how not to do it.<br />A very realistic perspective, well thought out, and a foresight of consequences that gives me goose bumps.n and Frank hit heads about how the planet should be run, and one day John is murdered - a shock to everyone.<br />Politics starts to play an important role as the first hundred decide they will do whatever they want on Mars rather than be controlled by Earth.

Nowhere is this more true than in books about writing. The danger in reading a book about &quot;how to&quot; write, is that it kills any of the writer's own voice, creative spirit, and instinctual sense of rhythm and timing, by focusing only on the technical aspect of writing. I've stayed clear of those types of books, because I fear that they will only make things worse and not better. And yet, I've hungered for something that could potentially give me some good points without cramping my style.<br />Fortunately, Betsy Lerners &quot;The Forest for the Trees&quot; does just that. She indicates early on that this is not a book about style. She obviously believes, that in spite of technical faults, an author may still produce very good work. So if this book is not about style, then what is it about? We're so used to reading &quot;how to&quot; books that I think we've forgotten &quot;how to&quot; do.<br />This book is about what motivates writers (and editors) and gives you some insight on how the system works. Lerner talks about different kinds of writers - some rely on instinct or &quot;natural talent&quot;, others are driven by anger, hope, or any other emotion. She encourages writers to be brave, to take a chance, but to recognize likewise if you've gone too far over the edge (it's a cliff, after all!). Lerner encourages writers to do their thing. She oozes confidence between the lines that a reader can't help but be caught up in.<br />Don't expect any advice on &quot;how to&quot; write in this book. You CAN expect a bunch of interesting anecdotes and thoughtful insights. You will understand more of the process involved in producing a manuscript and what will happen after the signing of a contract (if you're that lucky).<br />Informative, entertaining, succinct and beautifully written prose. I highly recommend this book to anyone who knows they want to write, but are uncertain about it. This book will give you the confidence TO DO.commend this book to anyone who knows they want to write, but are uncertain about it. This book will give you the confidence TO DO.	2004-02-21

Personally, I found the book fascinating. It has me looking up the true origin of any old term of phrase or symbol that I come across nowadays. It makes me think more deeply about all those symbols which we use so matter of factly that they are no longer truly symbolic. Sure, everyone has a sense of what the Nike swoosh stands for, but what about Leonardo Da Vinci's &quot;Last Supper&quot;? Nobody really studies those things any more, and they have become a  lost history among our society.<br />It is with skill, then, that Dan Brown manages to interest his readers into a topic that is almost a millenium old.  He appears to have done a bunch of research for this book. Not only that, but he also put a lot of effort into making that research come to life without seeming overwhelmingly heavy or detailed in the prose. That's not an easy thing to do, and it's what I most admire about the book. You only need to pick up a bunch of academic papers to realise that &quot;english&quot; is not a first language when it comes to scientific debate. We rely on journalists, movie directors and authors like Dan Brown to make such laden themes with their secretive and prohibitive language digestible for the general public's enjoyment.<br />Rather than taking the easy route by writing a simple, straight lined story about some art historian's discovery of the symbology of the Holy Grail, Brown created a mixture of interesting characters that each play a definitive role in his murder mystery. It's a combination of an Agatha Christie novel and a fictional history book. The skill of combining those diverse elements cannot have been easy, yet Brown manages to bring it off with a simplistic flair.<br />In truth, his story is captivating. It starts off with a bang - a murder of a curator. The audience is carried along with the main characters, and for a good part of the book we are shrouded by the truth. If you love solving puzzles, you will be able to &quot;beat&quot; the character to identifying the next clue or uncovering critical bits of information  by looking closely at the text (mirrors recommended).<br />Of course, no one is expecting a work of fiction to be entirely based on truth, but Brown has a different treatment of the age old topic of the Holy Grail and his take on it I found to be interesting.<br />Moreover, it has all the things a good book should have: it's engaging, easy to read in bite size chunks that should appeal to the general public, it's full of action and mystery, and it's well researched, thus has a ring of truth to it. I feel I must &quot;defend&quot; this book because I enjoyed every minute of reading it even though that opinion is probably not in vogue with &quot;serious&quot; readers..

I would not be surprised if he hasn't, as it would explain a lot about the length of this book, and the entire series.<br />It seems to me that Jordan himself knows no end to the story. If he's bored his readers then surely he's bored himself nearly to death.<br />Don't waste your time.<br />.	2004-02-07

Daly and J. Farley. The former is a well-known academic in the field of ecological economics. Although it is tempting to state that the book would make an excellent textbook for undergraduate students, or even high school students with an interest in economics and the environment, the authors note that the it is not really a textbook because it is not \\"a presentation of accepted concepts and propositions of a well-defined academic discipline\\". Indeed, the authors do not claim that ecological economics is a discipline in its own right, but rather a transdiscipline. In other words, ecological economics is a move away from the traditional concepts that have become enshrined in neoclassical economics, but still \\"under construction\\". This means that the contents of the book remain under debate in current economic thought, and any follow up texts may differ significantly from this all-encompassing attempt to introduce us to the transdisciplinary field of ecological economics.<br />The text may thus be inappropriate for readers who do not already possess an understanding of the history of economic thought and knowledge of the problems with the underlying assumptions and failures of existing economic models. Nevertheless, the text is simple enough to be understood by newcomers to the field as it contains the principles on which neoclassical economics is based, covering microeconomics, macroeconomics, international trade and policy. What is different in this book is that all aspects of economics are viewed from the point of our natural environment. In fact, an extensive section on \\"the containing and sustaining ecosystem\\" precedes the more traditional topics mentioned above.<br />The last portion of the book outlines that the text focuses on three issues: the allocation of resources, the distribution of income and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystem. In particular, the latter is emphasized. In part six, the book comes to the conclusion that three policy actions are required. They include that a quantitative limit be set to reflect sustainable scale, deciding on ownership of scarce resources, and finally, after political decisions have been made, trading and efficient market allocation.<br />The guiding viewpoint of the authors is heavily focused on policy. The book does cover some of the new thinking and models of ecological economics, such as the laws of thermodynamics, Pigouvian taxes, stock-flow and fund-service resources by Georgescu-Roegen, and other established theories in ecological economics. What is lacking is an attempt to remodel some of the neoclassical work, but we can forgive the authors this gap since the book is a not meant to be a theoretical academic paper. However, academics in this field may consequently find that they disagree with large portions of the text.<br />A strength of the book is its inclusion of references to well-known papers in the field, which makes it a very useful text for graduate students in the field. In addition, the layout is handy. It contains excellent tables and excerpts that summarize important concepts and complex issues. The text is interspersed with \\"Think about it!\\" questions, that force the students to apply the recently reviewed concept to an alternative situation, and helps them to develop a deeper understanding of the implications. At the end of each chapter, there is a \\"Big Ideas to Remember\\" section, which outlines key phrases and concepts that students need to know. Each section of the book, furthermore, contains a brief summary. This is not so much a review of the section as a reminder of what is really being said and what the author's viewpoints are. Some of the chapters that contain more complex ideas also have brief summaries.<br />In general, this book should be applauded for an excellent effort to cover the key ideas current in ecological economics. However, there are gaps and weaknesses in the text, such as the fact that only a few ecological economics theories are covered. In a way, the book attempts to dictate what we should do or think, rather than presenting students with a more overall, open-minded presentation of ideas in the field. I would have preferred the book to encourage more thought-provoking alternatives to some of the solutions presented.xt, such as the fact that only a few ecological economics theories are covered.

For starters, more than half the content of this book was part of Ellen's stand-up routine in her new Ellen DeGeneres show.<br />Unfortunately.<br />Or maybe fortunately.<br />I don't know which.<br />When Ellen did the stand up, the material was hilarious. When I read the book, it was anything but funny. In fact, it was rather annoying, not only because the material wasn't fresh anymore, but also because I continued to read the book thinking that at some point it was going to be funny ... At least it goes to show that stand-up is more than just words, it's about the delivery, and that Ellen is a great comedienne.<br />As can be expected of any comedian/nne, the material covered has some poignant insights. Such as, when you see someone you haven't seen for a long time, should you hug, kiss or shake hands with them?  Or, how the dentist receptionist tries to book your next appointment six months in advance, and asking whether the time will work for you. And the consistent theme about flossing that comes up here and there is quite funny, but not enough to make me laugh out loud.<br />Less interesting were \\"the serious chapter\\", \\"the controversial chapter\\" and \\"the last chapter\\" and \\"the bonus chapter\\" where you get free words, apparently (well, no, they're not free - I had to pay for the book and some poor tree had to be chopped for you to print words on it). It feels like Ellen and her editor sat down and said, you know, what you really need is a serious chapter, and that Ellen failed to come up with anything good (it's less than a page, not funny and not serious either).<br />And, apparently, Ellen thinks living in prison would be great. I don't follow her line of thinking and don't think she's really thought it through herself.<br />All in all, this book cost me less than 2 hours to read, and I'm not sorry for it. Anything longer would have felt like a waste of time. And although Ellen obviously has lots of talent for stand-up comedy, she also has no talent for writing.<br />Distinctly average.dy, she also has no talent for writing. <br />Distinctly average.	2004-01-18

Each topic is covered in about 2 pages, yet they contain enough detail and handy advice for the new dog owner to feel confident about his or her new relationship. Building that confidence leads to a well-behaved, confident pet, and the tremendous pleasure of ownership of another being.<br />The guide is divided into several useful sections as follows:<br />1. Getting acquainted - what kind of dog should you get? Coverage on the top 50 breeds in the US (although unfortunately my lovely puppy wasn't in it). How to deal with new puppy, how to read your dog's body language.<br />2. Training - everything from house-training your puppy, through to basic and advanced training. It also has a very useful section on correcting unwanted behavior such as chasing cares, digging, anxiety and much more.<br />3. Essential care - what you need to do to keep your dog fit and healthy. What kinds of toys to buy, whether to leave your pet in or out, and traveling with your dog.<br />4. Food - Nutrition, water, eating problems, snacks and special diets.<br />5. Health watch - preventing sickness and common problems, choosing a vet, neutering, breeding/birthing and caring for older dogs.<br />6. Easing common complaints - what to do about bad breath, bloating, sunburn and ticks, and many other quirks like flatulence and drooling.<br />7. First aid - in case your dog (I hope it never happens to you) needs emergency care.<br />8. Looking good - grooming and washing your dog.<br />These useful and crucial topics are interspersed with dialog boxes (Paws for Thought) that address questions you've thought about but never expected to get an answer on, such as \\"do dogs fake being hurt?\\" (p.300), or \\"why do dogs stick their heads out of car windows?\\" (p.202),<br />The book, not surprisingly, boasts contributors ranging from veterinarians, trainers, groomers and other animal experts.<br />So far, everything I have needed to know, or any questions I had about my dog, has been in this book. It's the first place I look to for answers. In short, this amazing book has been like a bible for me to raise my new puppy (and how to deal with all that long shaggy hair!).

In fact, I would almost say that it is over simplified - almost all of these analyses can be done in Excel - except that it's not as easy to do it in Excel as it is in SPSS. Although SPSS itself may be somewhat simple compared to other stats software, the guide itself is marvelous.<br />The guide not only takes you through the steps of \\"how to\\" use the software package SPPS, but it also explains why you would want to run a particular analysis and how to interpret the results. It then goes on to explain how to modify those results or analysis according to your preferences.<br />For those people wishing to run more complex models, such as multiple regression, it is probably recommended that you know the statistical theory behind it, or are taking a class on it, rather than try to do this simply by using the guide, in order to make sure that you achieve a full understanding of the results. Because SPSS is so easy to use, it's easy to fall into the trap of having it run an analysis that is not so easy to interpret.<br />However, for people who are using SPSS as part of a course, this guide is absolutely great and I highly recommend it for any SPSS users, since the help function in SPSS itself is virtually useless.	2004-01-18

This book brought home to me that the supposed be-all and end-all, seemingly untouchable subject of statistics is actually not as powerful as statisticians would have us ignorant innocents believe.<br />Thanks to the age of the computer, statistics has undergone a major revolution in recent decades, and new theories have continued to be developed on how to read and interpret data, and make inferences and conclusions about significant differences.<br />The book, thankfully, is easy to read and understand, unlike some uncomprehensible texts that I've plowed through in the past, which only served to confuse me further. \\"Fundamentals\\", on the other hand, provides the reader with a sound revising of the basic underlying principles of statistics, the assumptions people have been making for centuries and step-by-step addresses why those assumptions can be flawed in certain circumstances.<br />The text takes you through easy to understand examples of each applied statistical method and, in addition, offers a basic overview at the end of each chapter of the key points raised (for a quick review just before class, or in case you forgot some previous points).<br />The book covers a whole host of different statistical methods and in part 2, some alternative strategies of dealing with traditional problems.<br />All in all, enlightening and fills you with the smug satisfactory feeling of having \\"one-up\\" on the statisticians by understanding what it's really all about.	2004-01-18

The older he gets, the harder it becomes for author Lois McMaster Bujold to spin blow-away yet believable tales of the daring character she created so long ago. And yet, even without Admiral Naismith, his orgininal body parts and a fully functioning brain, Miles remains Miles - just a little more grown up and mature, with a little less reckless action. The man even checks with HQ on one or two of his drastic actions in this book.<br />The book begins with Miles' and Ekaterin's honeymoon (see previous two books on the bizarre and hilarious development between the two), and we find out that they are about to have twins - in replicators, of course, Barrayar no longer being barbaric since Miles' mother set foot on the planet. It is not long, however, before Miles gets a direct order from Emperor Gregor to deal with a &quot;situation&quot; that has developed in Quaddiespace, concerning Barrayaran soldiers and a Komarran merchant fleet.<br />Miles, as Lord Auditor, begins investigating into the strange events of a missing soldier, and a subsequent jailing of a bunch of Barrayarans and the Quaddie space committee's decision to freeze all port activity on Graf Station. Miles arrives in his usual style: arrogant, self-assuming and nosey - all the characteristics that have (sort of) kept him alive so far.<br />Unexpectedly, he meets up with Bel Thorne, Miles' previous right-hand man/woman of the Dendarii Mercenaries who has taken up a position as Port Master to be with her lover Nicol. Strange events begin to take place when they meet another Betan hermaphrodite and an odd genetic mutation from, where else, Jackson's Whole. But both Bel and Miles feel that there is something odd about the Betan, and when Miles, quite by accident, discovers he's really dealing with a ba from Rho Ceta's haut ... well, then things really start to become interesting.<br />McMaster Bujold creates some interesting new characters in this book, and a believable new society, the Quaddies, whilst hitting on some old themes about prejudism against race and genetic mutations.<br />Her writing, of course, is superb, as always. What is missing, however, is the obnoxious little Admiral Naismith and some of the best of his crew. Even Bel appears darn-right tamed compared to earlier books. And with Ekaterin at his side, a presence of strength and Vor traditions, it is difficult for Miles to deviate into the split personality we have come to love.<br />An excellent follow-up novel on the story of Miles, that lacks the punch of earlier books.then things really start to become interesting.<br />McMaster Bujold creates some interesting new characters in this book, and a believable new society, the Quaddies, whilst hitting on some old themes about prejudism against race and genetic mutations. <br />Her writing, of course, is superb, as always.

Bujold builds a complex but believable character in Caz, a down-and-out lord, whose luck in life seems to have expired. He finds himself homeless, horseless and physically in a bad condition, having to beg his way into employment with a lady he knows from his former life. We learn that Caz was a slave, pulling oars on a ship for many years, but don't know the details of what happened.<br />Caz is asked to become the personal secretary of Royesse Iselle, a 19-year old half-sister to the Roya (or king) of Chalion. She and her lady-in-waiting, Betriz are taken with Caz's teaching style, somewhat different to prior governesses that could not control the two wildcats. Iselle's younger brother is heir to the throne, but only 14 and sulky and impressionable.<br />As the story proceeds, we learn tidbits of Caz, the central character, and begin to piece him together. He is content to be away from court, for example, having fallen out of favour with the two most influential brothers who act as advisers to the king. Unfortunately, Iselle and her brother are asked to join their half-sibling at court.<br />It is then that the story starts to spin a bizarre tale. Caz meets a mysterious keeper of the menagerie of animals, tries to avoid confrontation with the two evil brothers, and generally gives good advice to Iselle, training her in court politics. Until, one day, Iselle is forced by the king to marry the evilist of the brothers.<br />In an insane act of selfishless, Caz uses death magic to save the day for Iselle. He doesn't expect to survive it, but somehow he does ... and as a result, he has changed. He can never go back; and learns about the curse that oppresses Chalion. Caz eventually finds out how to destroy the curse without destroying Iselle who also suffers from it, but not before some surprising turns of events.<br />A marvelous book, extremely well written and very entertaining. Bujold builds a world full of mystery and wonder. I could only have hoped for even more characters to fall in love with.g. Bujold builds a world full of mystery and wonder.

Her style is rapid, full of dialogue, and you hardly notice that you're reading - it's so smooth.<br />This book is a collection of stories about Miles, who recounts them to Simon, his boss in the imperial secret services. Miles himself is in hospital and cornered by Simon to cough up some details on the somewhat ambiguous reports Miles has been sending in. Like a rat caught in the corner, Miles has no choice but to spill the details.<br />The first is a story of Miles' younger years when his father sends him off to judge on an issue that happened among his own people. Barrayar, unfortunately, still murders babies that are deformed. It's a short murder mystery.<br />The second story revolves around Jackson's whole and the dubious activities that go on there. Miles' mission is to &quot;collect&quot; a person; but it's never as easy as it seems.<br />The third is the strangest yet. Miles ends up in an enemy prison camp. At first it's not obvious how he got there, but Miles being Miles, he soon gets people moving.<br />Bujold's writing certainly deserves five stars, as do the stories about Miles. The reason I give this only four stars is that two out of the three stories featured in previous &quot;collections&quot;. It's very confusing to the buyer: which novel comes before which? And although Bujold has a lovely table in the back of each book to help you with the chronology, it's almost impossible to buy books that only feature the stories you want. I now own three versions of the same story, and I resent having spent money on the same thing (not to mention the waste of trees that produced the paper for this).	2003-11-03

After all, what harm could there possibly be in hiding out on this old, forgotten planet?<br />Well, for one, Earth has a Barrayaran embassy. And, lo and behold, Miles' handsome cousin Ivan just happens to be there. Miles reports into the chief of staff,  Captain Galeni, who just happens to be from Komarr and whose family was butchered during the Komarr revolution. Walking on eggshells is something Miles was born to do, and he has ample opportunity to do just that.<br />Soon, there are complications. The promised payment from the Imperial headquarters does not arrive. Is it Galeni's fault or is something else going on.<br />On top of it all, Miles has fallen head over heals for Elli Quinn.  She's one of the few who know the truth behind Naismith and Miles Vorkosigan. But Miles feels his grasp of his dual character is slipping, and even starts to see and feel like a double.<br />A bit of an unexpected twist in this story makes it feel like McMaster Bujold is reaching somewhat. Of course we'd all have liked a bit more of her view of what Earth has become, but there's precious little of that. Still, her writing is as skillful as ever, and the characterisation and dialogue, as always, are superb. A move forward in Miles' private life is long awaited and a welcome read.	2003-11-03

Dee is trying to save money to rescue her sister from the hands of the Lords when one of her clients suddenly dies after taking some of Dee's drug concoctions. Dee does the only thing she can - she runs ... straight into the arms of a stranger from another planet, Ari, who says he can save her. But, there is something a little odd about Ari, the Poison Master.<br />Despite it all, Dee agrees to help him destroy the Lords and travels to Ari's planet, when his household help tells Dee that Ari is actually planning to poison her after they achieve their goal. The question is, whom should Dee believe, since she really knows neither party very well.<br />Liz Williams demonstrates sophisticated story telling skills. The dialogue runs smoothly and the story is captivating. In addition, she has some imagination! One of the reasons it took me so long to get into this book was due to all the strange references and situations/creatures that Dee runs into to. There is a small parallel story, running back to Earth's 16th century which adds interest, and though it was probably not really necessary, it completes the story.<br />Four stars for imagination, writing and characters.

It pains me to review Naked Empire, the 8th book in the Sword of Truth series, since I am an avid fan both of Goodkind and the adorable central characters he created in Wizard's First Rule, Richard and Kahlan.<br />Firstly, fantasy fans beware. This book is not packed with the usual action and world buidling of fantasy sagas. Now, Goodkind was never one to conform to the rules of typical fantasy books, but this book is a rule all onto itself. More than two thirds of it consists of tedious preaching on behalf of Richard to less enlightened souls about the value of life ... and consequently the justification for murder! Not only do I have trouble swallowing the mind-numbingly tripe &quot;philosophies&quot; of Richard, I find his conclusions incredulous.<br />I would have been able to forgive dubious values and even a speech or two by Richard if the plot were more forgiving. Unfortunately, and it is highly unfortunate, it seems like Goodkind has lost the plot.  Where is the action?  The plot is so thin that it can be related in two short sentences: Richard converts a bunch of non-magical misfits to his beliefs by saving them from evil occupation. And, oh yeah, he also finds out how to control his gift. There you go.<br />Harldy an effort worthy of Goodkind. And my question to Goodkind is: do YOU deserve victory?<br />The plots and characters just aren't explored. Nicholas the Slide is too obvious - you know from the start that Betsy the goat is going to be a pain in the behind (literally), and Jenssen, Richard's half sister, is frankly too annoying.<br />Goodkind spends the first 150 pages bringing readers up to speed on the plot thus far. This should tell you something of the value of Naked Empire as a book in its own right ... Life is too valuable to spend time reading this book.<br />The read was painful, my review is painful. I'm sure that Goodkind is feeling the pain too. By no means deserving of victory (nor my money).	2003-08-13

The book brings together seven pilgrims, who make the journey to the planet Hyperion in order to come face to face with the notorious and god-like Shrike. Each of the pilgrims has his/her own reason for being on the trip, and Simmons allows each pilgrim to tell his tale in his/her own style. It is the diversity of this story telling that makes it clear Simmons is a master of literature.<br />Slowly but surely, the reader begins to tie elements of the stories together, neatly woven to give you pieces of the puzzle, without giving away the answer. It is part of the beauty, and part of my sheer frustration, that the story really does not have an ending - rather the book finishes when the pilgrims reach their initial goal, which is to find the Shrike and the Tombs.<br />Once there, the question is, now what? Each pilgrim had a reason for coming, but how will they solve their individual dilemnas; what do they think the Shrike can (if he will) do about it; and most of all, why is Hyperion of such pertinent interest to the CEO of the entire Galaxy - or at least the planets that are connected to the web of technology.<br />The answers, like the book and its sequel, are complex. You have to read Fall of Hyperion for a satisfying conclusion. Nevertheless, the sheer beauty of this literature is astounding and deserves more than five stars.	2003-07-08

When her crew and equipment are destroyed, she quickly realises that there is danger and she and an ensign escape. Until, they are attacked by Barrayarans. Cordelia falls of a cliff and is knocked unconscious - upon awakening, she realises she has become the captive of an enemy of hers who's also known as the Butcher of Komarr.<br />Whilst in his company, Cordelia learns that he's not a butcher at all, but a rather sensitive man in his forties who has enemies among Cordelia's enemies. Cordelia begins to learn of the political intricacies that surround Barrayara, and also realises that she has fallen in love with her captor, a Lord Vorkosigan - next in line to the emperor.<br />In the first part of the book, Cordelia still feels a tug of returning &quot;home&quot; to her own planet, and sets herself free of Vorkosigan whilst eliminating a large part of his enemies. The second book starst with Cordelia's home-coming - a terrifying ordeal which requires her to undergo severe psychological counseling. Unfortunately, her actions and thoughts are misinterpreted, and she realises that &quot;home&quot; is no longer that for her.<br />Cordelia decides to join her love and runs away to the enemy planet. There, she becomes Lady Vorkosigan, and eventually a very powerful figure within the political intricacies of the world.<br />A stunning book, with powerful emotion and beautifully written. In her afterwrod, the author says she had trouble putting this prequel to the Vorkosigan series together. At times, we feel her struggle, but the book is never boring, and sets the stage for the story of Miles - the handicapped son of the Vorkosigans.	2003-07-08

In past books, they and their relationship has always been a fascinating one: a male chauvinist meets girl power and because he falls in love with her, has to learn to deal with it. Certainly, over the span of the series, Tiger's attitude changes and his character becomes more likeable (to women at least).<br />What does not change (much) is Tiger's thinking, his internal comments and arguments are along the same lines as in early books, but the reader,as well as Tiger himself, recognises that he becomes more hypocritical as result. His chauvinistic tendencies no longer fit. Del has changed him; and he has changed himself. Tiger has become an unlikely hero, messiah and mage. But deep down, Tiger is just Tiger: the best Sword-dancer in the Southern lands.<br />And in this final epic episode, Tiger proves that he is just that. Despite ordeals Tiger has had to survive and resultant loss of fingers, Tiger can still dance.<br />I felt that this book started slow. Perhaps this was done with reason - Tiger himself does not really know where he is going (or where he needs to go) until well past half way in. But I felt a bit of strain and struggle by the author here. We dilly-dally and some of the plot development seems stretched. We expect a set-back or two, of course since a hero never reaches his goal without them, but I'm unsure that Del's fate with the sandtiger constitutes a serious obstacle in terms of Tiger's path of growth and discovery. Nor am I entirely convinced that Tiger's exploration of magical abilities is entirely meaningful.<br />I also felt that, sadly, Del's role in this book was almost redundant. She has become a mere hanger-on, a character with no goals, no purpose, whereas in earlier books, Tiger was Tiger because of Del. Del helped Tiger on his path, helped shape him, made him who he is. We almost forget that in this book, because this story is about Tiger. I found it lacking, since so much of the strength of earlier books was due to the role Del plays in Tiger's life. Here she plays no role, other than to settle Tiger down (and in an almost disappointing way, taking away any kind of adventure to their future lives).<br />Further, some important developments, such as Tiger's son and daughter, Abbu and the building of a new teaching facility, could have been developed more deeply instead of skimming over them at the end of the book. This might possibly be because of the first person POV, which has its limitations. I can't help but think it could have been handled more meaningfully since although this ties up some loose ends neatly for the author, we know that (psychologically and internally) life does not tend to be as neat.<br />As an avid fan of the series, I enjoyed this book and am glad that it was written. Personally, I believe the series might have ended 2 books earlier, and let the remaining stories of Tiger and Del live in the readers' imaginations.<br />.since so much of the strength of earlier books was due to the role Del plays in Tiger's life.

US	49464433	RCRSD9CQ276ZU	0312965788	546505387	All Creatures Great and Small	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Passionate storytelling	&quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; is a passionate and autobiographical account by James Herriot of his early years as a vet. Recently qualified, the young Scottish James finds work in the 1930s in a remote area of the Yorkshire Dales, during a time when jobs, let alone paying jobs, are scarce. In possession of only a small suitcase, he makes his way to the middle of nowhere in Northern England, waits around for an interview with his new boss, which he lands despite having fallen asleep in the garden when his boss finally returns.<br />The eccentric Siegfried Farnon hires young James, and together they run a practice that mainly deals with cattle and farmers. Of course, being a stranger in this community is not easy, nor is it easy being a vet. Farmers have their own conclusions about cow diseases and some bizarre (non-scientific) treatments for them. It is up to James to convince them of his new found skills and to prove his worth in what is a reticent but deep down, a kind-hearted and generous community. In his job James runs across a bunch of interesting characters: his boss, Tristan who is the boss' carefree and accident-prone younger brother, farmers, a rich lady with a fat dog to whom James becomes and adopted &quot;uncle&quot;, as well as a girl or two.<br />The story is warm, funny and heartwarming. The story is not only an interesting personal story, but also fascinating from a historical and scientific point of view. And let's not forget James' relationship with all the animals. Herriot demonstrates a rare talent for telling an engrossing story.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended to audiences of all ages.<br />.	2003-06-01

In the third book of the predicted series of 6, Martin has managed to pick up the story and slam it home to readers that he knows how to write. Unlike book two, this book focuses on the key characters rather more precisely and concisely. Some of the detail is dropped, which makes it less devilish to tackle. There are rather fewer people to remember, which made it less hard on my brain and helped to deliver a focused, and overwhelmingly drawing story.<br />It is in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" that readers come to know the characters more closely and become drawn into their dilemnas, their choices and in some instances, their helplessness. Most of all, their temptations. It is these human aspects that brings the characters to life. And it's not stagnant - as in real life, the characters of this book change over time. We find an unlikely hero in the Hound, a sympathetic trait in Jaime Lannister, a demon in the Imp's whore. Arya, despite all her best efforts, never gets closer to home, and decides a new fate for herself. Jon Snow also meets with destiny, as does his half brother Robb. And there is sacrifice.<br />On the other side of the world, Martin demonstrates impressive writing skills in telling the story of Dany and the Unsullied (the short version was published independently, and I was attracted to it even then). Yet, she too, meets a limit to her power and exploits and learns that she needs to learn how to rule, not only to plunder and conquer.<br />It is the realism that Martin so successfully brings out in his characters that I particularly like. Each individual has hopes, desires, hates, loves, strategies that succeed and fail. They are, above all, human.<br />An outstanding effort from Martin and the most brilliant book in the series yet. Against my expectations, it was not tiring but invigorating, and has whetted my appetite for more to come in the series. I didn't even mind spending all the money on a hard-cover version!<br />An absolute \\"must\\".<br />*	2003-05-15

One of the main reasons I picked this book up was because it is dialogue driven. I later came to realise that each chapter, in fact, revolves around one of the many central characters to the book. The plot evolves from the point of view of each character, and the reader gets a nice, solid, all-round overview of what's going on.<br />If only it were that easy. The plot, in fact, becomes almost over-developed, with so many little twists and turns, backing up on itself with the unexpected, that it almost leads to nowhere and leaves the reader insanely frustrated, reminding me distinctly of the Wheel of Time series. Is this yet another marketing ploy, where readers are held in jest, never getting anywhere, and forced to buy more and more books? I hope not.<br />The details in this book are quite phenomenal, and vastly beyond my capacity. There are more \\"sers\\" and \\"houses\\" than I have cousins in real life - and if I can't even remember who all my cousins are, how on earth will I keep track of all the characters in this book? What holds the book together, thankfully, is the focus and development of a number of key characters that are particularly appealing, mostly the members of the Stark family, and let's not forget the parallel story of Dany, who's in another world entirely (for which we, sadly, have no map). Her world is stranger still, but there is a fate yet, for this blood-of-the-dragon girl.<br />The first book focuses mostly on setting a background for following books, along with an entire history for the older characters. There is little magic, a lot of fighting and cruelty and killing, but also some love making which helps alleviate some of the darker tones of the plot. You know that the children of Stark will be important in all this, but after all, they are still just children, and limited by adults and their plots. The personalities are more than just a little appealing, and Martin seems to get the characters exactly right, with flaws and human limitations and all.<br />For those that have a stomach for (physically) heavy books and the patience to read them and their details, I would strongly recommend this book. A Game of Thrones is a pleasure to read and a true fantasy masterpiece, right up there with the best of them.<br />Why only 4 stars - well, I just wish Martin had held off on some of those devilish details and created a somewhat more angelic book to read.<br />.more than just a little appealing, and Martin seems to get the characters exactly right, with flaws and human limitations and all. <br />For those that have a stomach for (physically) heavy books and the patience to read them and their details, I would strongly recommend this book.

In the end, one is rewarded with some focused development of plots.<br />The plot thickens, deepens, twists and turns, and takes on new shapes. Many, many people die in this book, but the reader is also introduced to what must seem like a thousand new names. The pinnacle of this for me was the battle in the bay at King's Landing, when we are suddenly required to remember the names of the ships of two entire fleets in order to make sense of the battle (I skimmed this section, needless to say). The battle was confusing - I suppose battles always are, but the story doesn't have to be. A bit more editing ... perhaps?<br />In similar construct to the first book, Martin dedicates each chapter to a character. Some new ones come about, and some more interesting than others. I personally felt that Dany contributed nothing to this second book, and her role could have been reduced greatly (or her plot should have advanced more quickly). But on the other hand, the book has some extremely interesting developments: Tyrion the Imp, for one. And some of the Stark children, such as Jon, Arya and Bran also find new twists of fate.<br />Largely, the book is overwhelmed by names of \\"sers\\" and \\"houses\\" (as was the last book), and an overdevelopment of the plot. Readers certainly need to be awake to plow their way through this one - no bedtime reading here.<br />What saves the book is that the pace and interest picks up again towards the end, and we can only hope that this will continue in the third book. For avid fantasy readers, and those that like extended sagas and series, this will be a fantastic read.<br />.	2003-05-02

And it's also the best put together of all books. The result is a work with character and the grit of real life war; a true page turner.<br />Moon focuses on young heros, Esmay Suiza, spoiled rich brat Brun, and a youngster of the famous Serrano family, Barin. At first, a usual misunderstanding of first love by Esmay and Barin - Esmay is convinced Brun is after her man, which leads to a blow up between the two young women. Unfortunately, the argument wasn't as private as Esmay thought ... the Fleet had a scan on Brun for security reasons.<br />Out of favour with her seniors, Esmay is in disgrace. Brun decides to leave her course with the Fleet as a result -- and unfortunately, is caught by a malicious bunch of religious fanatics who decide she will make a good breeding woman. Brun faces imprisonment, the embarrassment and humiliation of rape, and is forced to live mute among her captors.<br />Barin is harrassed by another young, beautiful officer, and Esmay hardly knows what to do with herself as Brun's father doesn't want her anywhere near the rescue operation. But she happens to understand what Brun's going through and even has a good idea on how to free her ... Brun has her own ideas, of course; and Barin, a Serrano, refuses to be left out of the action.<br />This work is truly compelling. Moon tells an entwined and captivating story of love, hate and the reality of warfare and how heros become heros. The story is complete, the characters are captivating and the scenario believable.<br />Five stars for this book which outshines all the others in the series.	2002-12-09

Ofelia knows this, and does not look forward to the move in cryopreservation, which is likely to kill her. As an elderly woman, she is no longer appreciated by her fellow colony, rather - she is a liability.<br />But Ofelia has her own plans. If she can only convince the colony to leave her behind ... all she wants to do is tend to her garden and be left in peace. No one to tell her what to do. No one to tell her what to wear. No one to chide her. She decides to hide herself when the colony moves out. She knows that they won't look long for an old woman ... and she's right.<br />Soon, Ofelia learns to set herself free. As the only one remaining on the planet, she can do whatever she wants. There is enough infrastructure left behind by the colony that she can survive for years. So she plants everyones gardens and finally gets to walk around barefoot and hatless.<br />But then, something unusual happens. One day, as she is at the center, monitoring for storms and writing \\"real\\" stories behind the notes on people who dies in the colony, she hears an interchange of humans attempting to land on the planet --- and something goes horribly wrong. Against all Ofelia's expectations and knowledge, the humans are attacked by aliens. Shortly after, strange things start to happen where she is. Doors left open that she was sure she'd closed. Or maybe she was just a crazy old woman after all?<br />The story of this 70 year old helps to remind us all that older people have lives and thoughts and feelings and are capable of things that younger ones are. Too often, our society disregards and disrespects those with experience who have the potential to live so much more. Life doesn't end at 70. Ofelia learns, in spite of herself, that she is capable of much more than she ever dreamed of. Her new self is the first to among humans to have alien contact. At 70, she has all the skills necessary to deal with this strange encounter and build good relationships with the aliens.

Just as the House is forced by circumstance to move to the planet Arrakis (Dune) and take it over from the Harkonnens, Paul enters adulthood. He is different; mature for his age through his noble upbringing and aware beyond the norm thanks to his mother's 'special' training.<br />Through his father's intelligence network, Paul comes to realise that moving to Arrakis is not as straightforward as it seems. There are sublte undertones of byplays and \\"tricks within tricks within tricks\\". The Emperor, the House Harkonnen, and the Fremen who cultivate the precious but deadly addictive spice on Arrakis all have a hand in the game.<br />No sooner have the Atreides arrived, in fact, and an attempt is made on Paul's life; and a little later, his father is murdered by a traitor. Circumstance would have it that Paul and his mother make a lucky escape from the hands of the Harkonnens who are behind his father's murder. Or is it the Harkonnens?<br />Paul and Jessica are thrown into the desert, an environment so harsh and unforgiving that survival appears impossible. It is Paul's determination, training, but mostly, his unquestioned willingness to accept the new environment for what it is, that eventually help them to hook up with the Fremen who have been a thorn in the Harkonnen's side. From there, Paul and his mother can build a base that will allow them to challenge the Harkonnens and seek revenge for the Duke's death and regain control of Arrakis. But, unbeknownst to his mother, Paul aims higher ...<br />The entire novel is stunning. It is rich and intriguing without being overly complex.

The only thing that made me finish this book is that I was in the middle of nowhere with no alternative fiction available.<br />Drake truly stunned me with his ability to write an entire book of which I have yet to figure out the plot. The story lacks depth and complexity; very little actually happens in this book, although there are many adventures. Unlike some of the critics, I did not think there was much orginality here; not even in the writing. It felt, and read, more like a children's adventure story than a true fantasy novel.<br />In addition, the characters are sadly lacking in depth, although I grudgingly have to admit I liked Cashel as the very normal country boy with unusual wizard talent (Nellie the sidekick sprite, on the other hand, got up my nose). Cashel begs to be explored more deeply, and perhaps this is done in the sequels. He is kind, thinks clearly (albeit slowly) and the reader can sympathise with his dispositions.<br />&quot;Lord of the Isles&quot;, however, is missing an irresistable hero (or heroine) that the reader can commit to regardless of character flaws. In fact, characters with personalities is something that Drake omitted altogether.<br />I finished the book, which is about as much as I can say about it. I have no idea why the rest of the trilogy was written, let alone why anyone would want to read it. In truth, I don't even know why this book was printed. Perhaps Drake has a better reputation for his other books; unfortunately for him, this is the only one I've read.	2002-09-20

As in the past, she impresses those around her in a short period of time through her strange accent, firestones, healing skills and her control over Whinney, Racer and Wolf.<br />The book unfolds slowly, feeling at times more like a lecture in paleoanthropology (both in tone and detail) rather than telling the intriguing story of the girl of the Others who was raised by the Clan. Though fascinating in its own right, the data on the Ice Age and its people are overbearing. Judging by the number of people thanked in the foreword, Auel has obviously done her homework, but it felt like I was doing mine. The pace is such that even at hundreds of pages in, we have but begun to meet the Zelandonii.<br />During the first half, the story is predictable and repetitive containing scenarios seen in previous books - even the love scenes lack the steam of earlier books. Ayla remains on centre stage and plays the role of saviour and role model for the weak and spiteful and, not to forget, spokesperson of the Clan. The Zelandonii, including Jondalar's old flame, seem unusually open and accepting of Ayla's background, unlike previous Others, and are (almost too) quick to adopt her. Ayla herself remains nervous of meeting new people - perhaps with good reason, as she also creates some enemies for herself.<br />The second half delightfully picks up, and it is almost a sigh of relief to see the story begin to flow again. Auel demonstrates a talent for captivating Story-Telling as she paces through events that take place during the Summer Meeting and the following winter.<br />There is a certain maturity in the writing that didn't seem apparent before. Auel takes us through a more comprehensive understanding of the spiritual beliefs of the Zelandonii (though I'm not convinced that she needed to repeat the Mother's Song so often). Spirituality also becomes more pertinent for Ayla, as can be expected, and Zelandoni needs to convince her to put aside her fears of the spirit world. Ayla has tremendous potential to influence the community, but will it be as the zelandonia see fit?<br />Three stars since Auel shows her true talent in the latter part of the book, and for sheer determination to see the project through.

It is the strength of the writing, but not necessarily the plot or characters, that enables me to give 4 stars to \\"Hunting Party\\".<br />The plot, if nothing else, is weak. Captain Serrano, recently evicted from the RSS, has taken on a job as captain of a private vessel for a rich old lady, Cecilia. She considers the role well beneath her proud ability as captain, but seems to have no other choice in her career path.<br />Lady Cecilia has onboard a (lazy and unwelcome) retinue: her young nephew and his friends. Neither she nor the Captain have much respect for the youngsters, and a prank set up by her nephew, brings the lady and the captain closer.<br />Soon after take-off, things start to go wrong. The normally fastidious Captain Serrano suffers a backlash from a lip-service she gave the vessel before take off. A death and machine problems on ship force an early landing and a bet with the lady who loves horseriding and fox hunting.<br />Once at their destination planet, the youngsters slip away from the eagle eyes of elders, and get themselves into a heap of trouble on a small island. Coincidentally, here is relation to Captain Serrano, and the reader finally become privy to her past.<br />The book's plot is something that might be expected of a children's story, although some of the characters are more mature than that. The young nephew and his friends are more of an annoyance than a contribution, and have confusingly similar names.<br />Nevertheless, \\"Hunting Party\\" makes for a fascinating read, and Moon has a way of expression and an eye for detail that draws the reader in. It has left me with the excited anticipation for the rest of the series, which I will definitely read.	2002-04-02

The story is about a new set of characters: Jennsen, daughter to Darken Rahl and therefore Richard's half-sister; and also Sebastian who is Emperor Jagang's strategist. Together, they make for an interesting mix to the Sword of Truth series.<br />As Goodkind is wont to do, the book addresses shadows that Darken Rahl's legacy has left behind. Now that Richard and Kahlan have each reached positions of power, it is only natural that Goodkind would begin to tell the story of those left out of the limelight. In fact, focusing on such characters adds enormous depth to the series.<br />After the heavily political but beautifully written \\"Faith of the Fallen\\", Goodkind brings us back to the main story: the war between D'Hara and those of the Old World. Except that this time, the perspective is from the \\"enemy\\".<br />The trials that Jennsen has faced in her life as a result of D'Haran rule brings to light the remaining ugly aspects of what has become Richard's empire. As readers, we can sympathise with Jennsen's point of view - it's hard for people to let go of perceptions once formed, even though the situation might now be different. Jennsen's determination to confront the new Lord Rahl about her hardship leads the story.<br />At her side is Sebastian, Richard's enemy, who makes for a natural ally to Jennsen. Sebastian becomes her rock, he supports Jennsen in the decisions she makes and helps her through the difficult journey to find Richard ... so that she can kill him. But as Jennsen comes closer to facing her brother, she starts to discover some disturbing things. Her mind is a battlefield in its own right.<br />Goodkind has done an excellent job in the portrayal of Richard's half-sister. Although Jenssen acts the \\"victim\\" at first, she develops into a determined and focused character - sharing some traits that Richard has.<br />On the sideline, there is Oba, also Darken Rahl's offspring. Like Jennsen, he is a \\"hole in the world\\" - immune to magic. But Oba is a much darker character and scary. I'm not convinced, in fact, that Oba's role was necessary: he seemed neither developed nor explored. It is Oba who inadvertently brings Richard and Jennsen together, but I feel that Goodkind might have conceived a better way.<br />The new characters will add to later books. It is a shame that some of them were terminated towards the end ... their development as a result of a final twist in the book could have made for interesting material next time.Oba, also Darken Rahl's offspring.

Attracted by this accreditation, I bought and read the first book. I was not disappointed.<br />Douglas has a great talent. In &quot;BattleAxe&quot; (The Wayfarer Redemption), she successfully introduces a new world with a multitude of characters and a complex storyline to the reader. She does so in a manner that drags the reader into her world, where characters are emphatetic and sympathetic. It becomes a pleasure to learn this new society and the reader gains familiarity with the 4 races through gentle introduction.<br />Skillfully, we begin to feel comfortable about Ichtar, getting to know its ins and outs through the developing roles of the characters and their relationships. Incredibly, Douglas holds the strings of around 20 key characters with ease, each with their own purpose, feelings, thoughts, developments and decisions.<br />Even better, the plot is strong. Characters and pieces of the puzzle start to fit together towards the end of the book when (we think that) the roles of individuals become clearer. Why has Axis always been able to sing? Why GoldFeather lives with the Incarii? Who are Ogden and Veremund really? And Faraday -- our heroine sheds her naivety and innocence, and is forced by circumstance to grow up all at once.<br />Some questions remain, of course, for following books in the series: Will Axis' love for Faraday negatively impact him as suggested by the prophecy? And exactly what or who *is* Azhure - the mystery lady without a home?<br />Lots of characters, lots of development, intrigue and plot lines that could divert into any number of branches. Douglas obviously worked hard at this book (and series) and the effort has paid off. I've given it only 4 stars just because Douglas is still a small step away from a brilliant masterpiece. I have no doubt this is in the pipeline ...	2002-01-09

The Truthsayer's Apprentice begins with the apprentice, Dalin, who is sent out on a mission by his master. But his travels are interrupted early on when he spots an evil looking gang. The unlikely travellers in this remote corner of the world are unusual and Dalin follows them to consequently witnesses the murder of his master. Unsure what to do, Dalin follows the group. However, the runemaster and leader of the group discovers him and leaves him (nearly) for dead.<br />Dalin is saved by a second group of travelers to this remote area, and joins them in their search of the magical Robe that was stolen during the murder. The rest of the book follows the story of Dalin's pursuit to avenge his master's death and retrieve the Robe. We also learn the reasons why the different groups of people all seek possession of the magical Robe.<br />Christian's writing is simple to understand although the plot and storyline are not as clear. The development of characters is jolted and my personal opinion is that too many were introduced at once, making it difficult to keep track of who is who and what their backgrounds are. It was even difficult to remember which elves, dwarves and humans belonged to which group as Christian introduces a great many tribes and peoples. In the end, it made for tedious reading - although the book definitely picked up towards the end, when readers get more insight into the situation.<br />Reading the book, I felt like I had maybe somehow skipped a prequel to it; such is the assumption by the author that you understand the background and peoples. The characters are underdeveloped and it is therefore difficult to be sympathetic to their causes, with the exception perhaps of Dalin. The setting is both imaginative and interesting, but unfortunately, we are not provided with any details of this magical world.<br />It is not the story, setting or characters in themselves that I find lacking, but probably the structure and development of the book itself. I feel that Christian ought to think more carefully about how she introduces characters, histories, and plots to the reader. Christian obviously put a lot of thought into this world, judging by the detail of the appendix at the end - if she had applied the same sort of dedication to the writing, this book would have been a lot better (and a lot fatter).<br />The book deserves three stars for the amount of effort that seems to have gone into it and because Christian has plenty of imagination, although it borders on a 2-star construction for me.el that Christian ought to think more carefully about how she introduces characters, histories, and plots to the reader.

Even if you've never worked in finance in your life, you will still think it's funny and entertaining. Besides which, you will get a thorough education on the bond market and its growth in the mid eighties.<br />Since this was one of the books often referred to by MBA programmes, I was hesitant at first to read it (one of my pet hates is all those silly books about &quot;how to&quot; from supposed &quot;experts&quot; who have since lost all their money or credibility because they were too greedy or didn't see change coming - which is why they had to write the book). Yet, I found myself in need of literature one day and spotted the distinctive yellow cover (in Singapore at least). I was attracted immediately by the title and then proceeded to read the first paragraph. I almost sat down promptly on the floor to keep reading it - a good sign that this was good reading.<br />Lewis has a talent for story telling. He combines this talent with an uncanny ability to be able to explain a very complex market in a very simple way. The &quot;pull&quot; of this story is that you KNOW it really happened. It is easy to cast your mind in the author's shoes, and BE on the trading floor with him. You can feel the excitement when the market turns, taste the sweat of other traders, hear the noise of the commotion on the 42nd floor, and sense the tense environment created by several hundred people in one area all trying to make a quick buck.<br />The story begins by an explanation of the game &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; itself. From then on, the gambling begins and the dice continue to roll ... the very bizarre way in which Michael gets a much sought after position at a prestigious investment bank ... to an intriguing story about the movers and shakers at Salomon Brothers, and the company's inevitable downfall.<br />Pseudonyms, of course, are used. But we can all imagine what &quot;the Human Piranha&quot; looks like and certainly know what type of person this is. Women can despise the competitiveness and prejudice that reaches its ultimate point in this type of environment, and is practised only by men, for men.<br />The book tails off a little at the end. The author (rightly) describes how his career takes off with the company and his inevitable resignation from the firm (Michael, I'm totally with you -- it takes a certain type of person, without scrupples or morals to be able to sustain themselves in this type of workplace).<br />The only slight weakness is that the author tries to justify his choice at the end (there's no need to, because we understand why early on), by saying &quot;money isn't everything&quot;.

I launched straight into this book (the first of the series was not available at my store), but did not find myself lacking intimate details on the characters. Drake neatly links in both Mundy as well as Lt Leary's backgrounds.<br />The story had intrigue, although it could perhaps have been developed a little beyond what was essentially a basic plot. I had trouble, however, with some of the connotations of flying in outer space and visiting new planets, pirate astrogators and what not. For a newcomer to this genre, I found I quickly lost myself in Drake's descriptions of what was going on with the (command) of the ship and the meaning of the Matrix. I believe that somehow this experience was supposed to be profound, yet I could not help but find it slightly boring.<br />The characters are fun and it's easy to understand what they represent, although perhaps they needed some further fleshing out. Officer Mundy seems completely nerveless, a librarian, data/information freak who is shoots a mean gun; almost inhuman - though not quite as inhuman as her servant is suggested to be. I find it extremely difficult to believe that her consistent (information) hacking never, ever seems to fail. It's too good to be true, and certainly not representative of real life (let's consider all the viruses that have been affecting our internet).<br />All in all, not a bad book, but I found something was lacking. I'll probably try another few authors in sci-fi before I dismiss the genre, however, since Drake touches the edges of what could be a really good book.	2001-09-26

It lacks depth of character and atmosphere; the conversation is stilted, the achievements superhuman. The plot is formulaic, and obviously leads from fact finding to consequential action. If you played the game (which I haven't) you probably get to &quot;practice&quot; killing the bad guys -  if you fail, you can always start again from where you last saved. The game, no doubt, has some level of challenge to it. The book doesn't.<br />I can see what Feist was trying to do here - continue a line of books with what must be one of my favourite characters, Jimmy the Hand. Put James in a tight spot and he'll invariably get out. Tragically, the squire totally lacks any hint of personality in this book and the two sequels. Mr Feist, as a WRITER, could have used a little more imagination to pull the reader into a fantastic story. Instead he follows the rather basic plot line of a simple computer game.<br />Sadly, this sub-series does not improve with time. It gets worse. I'm currently reading book three: Krondor, Tear of the Gods. It's so bad, I'm considering not finishing it at all (which would be the first for a Feist book for me ... I love the guy).<br />The first book and even the second at least deal with elements roughly defined within Feist's series on Midkemia: the Oracle, the stone at Sethanon, dark elves, etc. The third borders on the ludricous - vampires in Midkemia? ... honestly!... Obviously, the game developers took over and Mr. Feist took a back seat in his own world.<br />I'm actually quite outraged that this series was published at all. They should have left it as a game and not bothered with this half-hearted attempt at a book. I've never quite felt so cheated of my money before --- and that is probably Mr Feist's greatest accomplishment in this trilogy.	2001-08-10

Feist, in showing the commercial side of Midkemia, portrays a maturity rarely found in the fantasy world. It completes Midkemia like no other adventure story could have. Roo's financial exploitives are realistic and believable, and Barnett's is more than another name to the reader - although I still don't pretend to understand options and futures, despite Feist's portrayal.<br />Erik also continues to mature (in the military world) in this book and we are reacquainted with members of the Royal family and other favourites from Feist's first series.<br />Strategically speaking, this book is brilliant: it definitely sets the stage for more: you just know that something (bad) has to happen to Roo's wealth, or at least to his marriage ... Roo's mistress, Sylvia (daughter of the other richest person in Krondor), has him completely wrapped around his finger. If all else fails, there's always the impending war by the Saaur or the mysterious third dark player ...	2001-06-15

Although I am inclined to agree with previous critics that this book contains a strong political message, it does not seem out of place with Richard and Kahlan's tale. The fight for Truth and the fight for freedom continues. More unforgivable is the lack of editing in this text. Many passages containing thoughts of the characters are repeated several times over. Richard's arguments with common people in the Order become repetitive and uninteresting to read.<br />Nonetheless, this book has strength. We finally see Richard and Kahlan spending a little time together - their perfect happiness in each others company is something yearned for by readers in earlier books. Cara demonstrates her soft side in company of the happy couple. Richard's &quot;fish-in-a-jar&quot; are but one of the little points of humour woven into the story. It makes Nicci's capture of Richard and his subsequent separation to Kahlan all the more painful to the reader. Nicci's conversion at the end makes for a nice change to the traditional gruesome finish for the baddy in fantasy books.<br />Richard's carving talent plays an enormous role in the book - something only hinted at previously. Having read &quot;The Agony and the Ecstacy&quot;, it is easy to see that Goodkind either has artistic tendencies himself or is simply very good at doing his research on carving. Kahlan also shows her talents and lives up to her military training and takes on the Order's enormous forces. She proves herself as a capable leader and general; yet smart enough to know when time is running out.<br />Many issues have been hinted at in this book, and many remain outstanding: the Order has invaded the Midlands, Ann has not found Nathan the Prophet but managed to get her journey book &quot;healed&quot; by some strange magical beings, Zedd has gone off with Adie to protect the Keep. All these are lined up for future books in the series. I hope this time, Goodkind can find it in his heart to keep Richard and Kahlan fighting side by side..

Furthermore, he presents his detailed knowledge in an readable format that is relatively easy to follow. He gives excellent insight into the workings of Asian businesses, their unwillingness to disclose information and the dangers associated with hidden transactions, creative accounting and inefficient (family) management. The research Backman has gathered in this book is priceless and thorough.<br />Though I would never claim to be an expert on Asia myself, having lived more than 10 years in the region, I found that I was often grinning to myself in agreement with Backman's observations. Backman further managed to fill in many blanks I have in my Asian business knowledge, having grown up to realise only the social aspects of the various cultures here.<br />This book is an excellent read and a good reference guide for non-Asians doing business in Asia. I also suspect it's useful for Asians doing business outside their own countries, since often these sort of cross-border, cross-cultural relationships can be tricky in the region.	2001-03-27
US	49464433	R25000DOB5B64L	0553564943	930626996	Magician: Apprentice	Books	4	6	7	N	N	More than just a fantasy book	I have come back to this book (&quot;Magician&quot; - both Apprentice and Master in one edition), nearly 10 years after first reading it and recalling only the scene where Pug is standing on the top of the Assembly's tallest spire about to become a Black Robe.<br />I was astounded by the sheer depth of characters, cultures, plot and human aspects of this book. The story builds up slowly and the reader grows up with two boys, as good as brothers, whose fates are slowly uncovered. Swept along by circumstance, each boy finds himself in a situation at the very edge of his imagination. They, as well as others in the book, become the impetus for change in a world invaded by the alien Tsurani -- or so they believe. Until Marcos, a magician, enters the scene.<br />Raymond Feist obviously thought this book out well, despite this being his first professional effort and, by his own admission, &quot;not really knowing what he was doing&quot;. The characters and events are carefully placed, tying in neatly not only with later developments, but also with the strange world of Kelewan and the Tsuranuanni (and the &quot;Daughter of the Empire&quot; series).<br />Imaginative, creative, entertaining and captivating. My only criticism would be that its characters are missing a bit of raw emotion and passion. Hence, the four stars.	2001-03-10

In a world where life has no meaning, so long as it is forfeited via subtle political strokes through great Game, Mara needs every scrap of her wits, stubborness and determination to survive and continue the Acoma line.<br />In this book and the rest of the series, the innocent girl from convent life becomes a powerful and dangerous Player. Determined to be unmoved by her unfortunate position, Mara's keen political sense ensures her survival. Her resolve, persistance and imagination (unusual for the ever traditionally minded Tsurani) propels her family from what is, at best, an uncertain position to one of the most powerful in the world. BUT, not without paying a price. Mara must learn that she is, first and foremost, human, before she is a player.<br />Based on Feist's Kelewan world, the &quot;aliens&quot; as created in the &quot;Magician&quot; series, Wurts adds her talent for detailed plot, intrigue and human emotion to Feist's imaginative series, to create one of the most powerful stories in fantasy today.<br />For those who've read the &quot;Magician&quot; series, you will be excited to recognise a number of characters and learn to understand what drives the &quot;aliens&quot;. For Wurts fans - this book will not disappoint you - it has every speck of Wurts-ness that make her other series so darn good.<br />In one word: &quot;unputdownable&quot;.	2001-03-10

It's short, quick, to the point. It's also refreshing, with its simple and direct storyline recounted by Tiger, whose fate is thrown in with Del.<br />Del is sexy, mysterious, magical and deadly dangerous. Tiger is sceptical at first about her abilities as a sword-dancer, a strong sexist/cultural theme that runs throughout the novel. Del is on a quest in search of her brother, kidnapped as the only surviving family member (apart from Del herself) of a raid on her Northern family by the Southrons.<br />As the novel progresses we learn more about the mysterious background of both Tiger and Del, and Del's magical sword that is cold to the touch. The story has a heart-wrenching realistic edge to it adding deep insight into following ones dreams and then so often finding that they are not what we expected them to be. The &quot;dirty&quot; side of life is not brushed under the carpet, but gradually revealed by lifting the tattered edges.<br />Why only four stars? I felt the novel lacked an intricate plot usually prominent in fantasy series. Though it was refreshing and punchy, I did not really lose myself fully into the story and missing was the savouring of details and interactions. Also, Tiger's story in the first person means that Del remains a mystery throughout the novel - apart from his observations we don't really get an insight into what drives this somewhat mad, yet enticing young woman.<br />Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend this book as a refreshing  and captivating read.	2000-10-26

Although there is no doubt that Ms Wurts is an excellent writer, I found this book somewhat unoriginal. Both Taen  and Jaric are represented as handicapped children who overcome their  problems and find strength when confronted with their fates, which sounds  like a typical children's fairy tale. For some reason, I find myself unable  to relate to these characters. The rapid development of Emien, Taen's  brother, becoming an &quot;evil&quot; character is also unrealistic. A  further, rather disappointing surprise, is the fact that the Vaere is a  computer, mixing fantasy with unimaginative science fiction (and I'm afraid  I'm a fantasy fan). Compared to the Wars of Light and Shadow, Stormwarden  remains in the shadow.	2000-06-22

Like many people, it cost me a lot of effort to &quot;plow&quot; through this book. Nevertheless, I was completely swept away by the powerful characters and fascinating story line. This book is unlike any other  fantasy book I've read. Although the plot is based on the usual good vs  evil, Ms Wurts uncovers very complex themes and heros. One moment you like  Lysaer, the next you know that he's turning but you don't want to admit it,  and then finally you have to face the fact that he's really not likeable at  all. Arithon is equally difficult to make out at first, and needs to grow a  reader's trust and respect as he's ever elusive. Yet, although we never  find out enough about him, Arithon sweeps us off our feet, like the  mysterious boy next door. The Fellowship of Seven are hilarious old men,  and my grandpa would have fit right in.<br />This is a complex book, with many  details and it's easy to miss changes in the plot unless you read  carefully. However, it is a brilliant set up for the rest of the series,  where the characters are further explored, their humanity uncannily  realistic and grow into personalities. Readers will learn to love some  characters, sympathise with others and dislike a few, as you would in real  life.<br />If you can grit your teeth and cling on to follow the plot through  the verbose jungle, then you find your energy and time well spent ... for  the rest of the series.	2000-06-22
