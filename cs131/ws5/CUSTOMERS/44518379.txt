I must say that this book was better than her first book (The Red Diary) this book had more of a romantic-suspense feel to it.  I loved the characters (especially Jake, WOW!!) even though he did get on my nerves toward the end of the book, by literally breaking Stephanie's heart, but thanks to GOD, he accepted the love he had for Stephanie all along, and they're living happily ever after.  Very good book.	2005-06-30

No...Just Suspense	I liked this book because it kept me on edge as I was reading it, as to who the killer could possibly be.  At first I thought it was Kristen's boss, John.  But that proved to be wrong, and I was totally shocked when the real killer was revealed.  Ms. Rose put a lot of time and effort in this book to keep her readers in suspense, but the romance was not there for me.  The suspense outweighed the romance in my opinion.  Overall this was a good book and I will be reading Ms. Rose's next book.	2004-10-20

I couldn't wait until this book was released, the first book \\"Into the Fire,\\" featuring Cortland's brother J.D. was equally as good, all because of the love/hate relationship between Terri and Cort.  Cort couldn't deny his feelings for Terri in the first book and Terri couldn't deny the love she's had for Cort since she met him when she graduated the police academy with J.D. In the \\"Heat of the Moment,\\" literally, the \\"sparks\\" continue as Terri and Cort team up to catch a serial arsonist.  Terri as tough as ever, and butts head with Cort once again, but they soon learn to trust one another.  Terri having sex with Cort on her Harley motorcycle! Now, how trusting can you get!  All I can say is Wow!! Terri also undergoes a makeover from head to toe, which all I could say was \\"It's about time!\\"  She needed it \\"bad\\" in my opinion.  Overall the book was exceptionally good, from the drama to the suspense to the romance.  This book keeps you on the edge of you seat.  Ms. Hall, I can't wait for the your next book!	2004-10-18

Word for it, I think this was a very good book. I'm glad the story takes us back to CIA, to me this book is somewhat a spin off of \\"ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN\\". This book was just what I suspected for my favorite author.  Although, it took me a while to buy for the simple fact I was going by what critics were saying about the book.  Never again will I do that.  I love Linda Howard's work and always will.  Lucas and Lily shared trust, understanding, and passion, that existed for a short time through their past relationships. Lucas had a life of being somewhat isolated and alone, and Lily had a life where she dealth with death practically on an everyday basis and was always looking over her shoulder. Although unusual cirmcumstances brought them together, their union made their lives worth living again.  The book was a page turner and a keeper in my opinion. Buy it!!	2004-10-11

Although I must say that I am not a fan of books featuring vampires and werewolves, this book was very interesting.  Jessie and Will had the perfect love affair although she had doubts about him at first, which was understandable.  It would have freaked me out meeting a man for the first time, in the dark, in the woods (...).  I couldn't believe that the people Jessie worked for and worked with were the actual werewolves in question.  You have to read it to appreciate it.  Very good book, can't wait for the next one.	2004-10-11

That everytime Vivian and Spike got intimate it was always on the sly and they were always interrupted.  I just wish there was whole chapter dedicated to them making love in a bed all night long.

In this series of the gang from Visitation, NC, I have to say that \\"When Bruce met Cyn\\" was my all time favorite.  \\"Just a Hint--Clint\\" moved a little too fast for me and the ending was kinda boring.

I normally don't rate a book with 5 stars, but what more can I say, this book was beyond good, it was excellent.  Not to much sex but the right amount, and not too much suspense, but the right amount to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Sable and J.D. having sex on a parade float, now that's a new one on me. How they got away with that, I don't know. My favorite character has to be Terri, her no-nonsense-attitude and tough-cop-demeanor, along with her humor, had me laughing until I cried.  Especially during her love scene with Cort, \\"You want me to stop?\\"  Pulling her spare gun out of the nightstand drawer and pointing at his face. \\"You want to die?\\"  That part in particular had me in the floor laughing.  For a book that was only 291 pages it sure did pack a huge romantic-suspense punch.  I can't wait for Cort and Terri's story to be released.	2004-08-24

It surprised me that the sex was so outstanding between the two main characters and it was never documented that either one of them (especially Nicolas) had ever been sexually involved with anyone in the past. Nicolas even admitted he didn't know how to handle a woman. Why was Dahlia on birth control when she was supposed to be a virgin? She never came in contact with any other people, beside Milly, Bernadette and Jesse in the bayou. And Dahlia claimed she had never been touched by a man.  But when she had sex with Nicolas for the first time, she acted like she was well experienced.  And how old was Dahlia and Nicolas anyway? That was the confusing part to me.  When I read a book, I guess I like to know the little details about the characters, this one lacked somewhat in that area.  The other somewhat confusing part was the main characters, including the Ghostwalkers, beyond normal mental abilites, although I caught on later on in the book.  Overall, it was a good read.  I wonder if Gator will have a book next, hmmm.	2004-08-13

Ms. Phillips really showed her writing talents in \\"The Bachelor\\", \\"The Playboy\\", and \\"The Heartbreaker\\", but this book left something to be desired.

I picked this book up at Barnes and Noble, hoping that it would be a good read.  Let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  I like the way the romantic chemistry between Betsy and Soldier came to a head, after they discovered who was who at the conference. Although both characters had self-esteem issues they had to deal with and overcome. The playful banter between them had me laughing until I cried. Suspense-wise, I had a feeling that Betsy was being stalked by someone she knew, but it was oh so nice to have a bodyguard around you 24/7, as handsome and as sexy as Soldier.  Believe me, you won't be bored reading this book. Can't wait for the next book by Ms. Stillings.	2004-08-08

Both her first book, (WHEN THE STORM BREAKS) and this book, are the best well-written romantic suspense novels, in my opinion. I like her books because they are detailed with excellent plots and strong lead characters.  As you read, you can't put them down and Ms Lowell gives her books just the right amount of chapters, to keep you enthralled for more than a day or two.

This book took me and kept me in a trance for 2 1/2 days, I was mad, I was crying and I wanted to kill David myself. It hurt me that a man could hate his only child so much. Juilette was definitely a strong woman and Billy was equally strong. Their strength kept them alive through the whole ordeal, along with Nick's determination, in doing his job and following his heart, to see that they stayed alive and safe. Nick fell in love with a woman and her son, during a time of chaos and uncertainty, and during the process chased away his own demons. &quot;Promise him anything&quot;, is truly a winner in my book.	2004-08-02

I bought this book at Walmart, on a whim, not really interested in reading it at first, because I had 4 other new books waiting for me to read that I had ordered from Amazon.  It was only 281 pages long, so I told myself to read it first and get it over with, because it didn't look like that much of an exciting read.  Boy, was I wrong! This book captured me and held me the entire 281 pages.  Ms. Rosnau's writing reminds me of Suzanne Brockmann's. Sly was an exact replica of a Navy SEAL, but the elite team of operatives that he was a part of were called Onyxx agents.  <br />Handsome, rugged, tough and dangerous, but a man with heart and a soul.  Once he heard Eva's voice he knew he had to have her, and when he laid eyes on her it was all over. (Just read the book and you'll know what I mean.)  The story is one of the most action-packed-suspense-filled-romantic novels I have read in a while. Ms. Rosnau didn't cut any corners with the language and the love scenes either.  I figure if you're going to write a book, do it with gusto, don't be afraid to give the readers what they want. I don't write many reviews online on books that I have read, but I couldn't resist giving this book the props that it deserves.  If you ask me, Brockmann has serious competition now.  Now, I can't wait to read Bjorn's story, February is a long way away.	2004-07-16

I must say that this book by Ms. McKenna grabbed me and drew me in from the first chapter to the last, I couldn't put it down. At first I thought it was going to involve a character from her second book STANDING IN THE SHADOWS, but I was glad it did not.  I have to rate this book up there with her first book BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, with her second book, STANDING IN THE SHADOWS in a close third place. Seth and Raine were totally made for one another in BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, so erotic, passionate and in tune with each other. In this book, I think Simon and Ellen's, love affair mirrors Seth and Raine's. I also have to give props to Cora, she was hilarious.  The book was wonderfully written.

Las Vegas ex-cop Logan Wolfe escapes his demons and relocates to the peaceful little town of Plentiful, Wyoming. He keeps a low profile, only telling people that he's retired. He meets bookstore owner Scarlett O'Malley.  She's instantly attracted to the gorgeous ex-cop and he's facinated by her sexy petite body and cute belly button ring. Scarlett on the other hand, along with four nosey elderly women who visits her bookstore regularly, has already been spying on Logan. They think he's a gigolo, because he's been seen with another wealthy elderly woman, (Opal). Then a unidentified woman visits Scarlett's store while she's hitting on Logan, in addition to urging him to purchase some books. After he leaves the unidentified woman collapes and dies. Scarlett's stepfather Adam Grant (Chief of Police) enters on to the scene to investigate. Scarlett has her suspicions about Adam because she believes he had something to do with her mother's death and she doesn't like him. Scarlett starts her own private investigating of Logan, because one of the elderly sleuths, tells her that she saw him carry something that might have been Opal's body wrapped in carpet out of the wealthy woman's house. (You'll definitely enjoy the chapter where Scarlett breaks into Logan's house escaping two Grizzly bears, and you'll also like the following chapter.) Now in addition to a dead unidentfied woman, Opal is missing and the sleuths think Logan killed her, but Scarlett is doubtful. Scarlett and Logan start a relationship and he opens up to her about his past, then they team up to figure out what the hell is going on in Plentiful, Wyoming. the Anyway, this book is funny, sexy, suspenseful and an all around good read, you will not want to put it down.	2003-02-09

Jordan did it for me, plus he was fine and could cook, loved children and animals.  I read all of the Buckhorn brothers exciting tales as they made their way to the altar, but my favorites were Morgan's and Jordan's stories. Lori, all I can say, is that you sure know how to keep a woman up at night, I can't put your books down.	2002-12-11

But overall, the action, the suspense and the hot sex!!! were exceptionally well written in all three books.  Now, I can't wait to read about Kane and Derek.  C'mon, Cherry!, starting writing.	2002-12-11
US	44518379	R2RXNKSLBYK5CE	0515131733	800958503	The Winston Brothers	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very good	It's amazing how Lori makes all the male characters in her books so handsome and so loving, and quick to fall in love.  And all the women are average in looks, not strikingly beautiful and they all have backbone.  I like that. I liked how she made the men so passionate and sexy, and the sex scenes so real, but not overbearing. I enjoyed reading about the Winston Brothers, I also enjoyed her other 2 novels, \\"TOO MUCH TEMPTATION,\\" and \\"NEVER TOO MUCH\\", featuring the Badwin brothers, Noah and Ben. Those were some HOT!!! stories.  Now, I'm in the process of reading some of Lori's earlier work, \\"CAUGHT IN THE ACT,\\" and \\"BEGUILED.\\" With still more reading to go.	2002-11-11

Ashton was so suave and debnoir, so persistant and patient, so romantic and loving. I would have loved to see a man like Ashton in person. Nettie's strong convictions about military men, made her have a change of heart after Ashton finally got a hold of her. She was addicted, although she didn't want him to know about it at first. I remember when she said, that she didn't know what she was going to do with him, and at that point I knew Ashton had her wrappped around his finger. Ashton was on a mission, a mission he was not going to lose...Talk about stories of love at first sight, this book was filled with it.  Okay, now Sir Drake was a character, and I understand he's something else, literally...	2002-10-24

Ashton was fine, charismatic, a perfect gentleman, persistant, a good kisser and a good lover. I'm sorry Nettie but the man was not worth all of your resistance, military or not.  Ms Jackson needs to continue Ashton and Nettie's story, I want to know what they named the triplets.  Also, I would love to know how things are going with Howard and Rainey, Jada and Rome.  This was a very good book.	2002-10-24
