The boy, six years old,  becomes the object of brutality and prejudice, all of which stems from a combination of peasant  superstition and Nazi hatred.  The peasants have no limit to their  heartlessness: they beat the boy, molest him, and they nearly succeed in  killing him-all for the color of his skin (just like Lekh's painted bird).   In their minds the boy is nothing more than an ethnic curse to their  village, one who could potentially incite the Germans to slaughter everyone  within earshot. Just when the boy senses that the peasants will destroy  him, he flees to the next village, and the whole process starts anew. In  his wanderings he learns judgment and the ability to discern crescendos of  violence.    <br />The book is replete with gruesome images: bunkers  filled with hungry rats that devour a living body with the efficiency of a  school of piranhas; broken Jewish bodies moaning beside the train tracks; a  dead woman melting under the heat of her burning shack.  Death.  The book  is replete with it.  In the midst of such desolation, the boy longs for  stability and friendship and the confidence of trust.  But he is  disillusioned and betrayed each step of his journey, and the lessons of  evil change him in ways he does not know.     <br />The Painted Bird has  torn me away from my cozy world and has shown me another sphere where  people treat human life as though it is not human. The book is certainly  gripping and a little disturbing; it has left in me an uncomfortable  feeling that I cannot shake.  I guess one hallmark of the successful book  is its ability to do this.	2000-07-25

Sad, yet compelling.  As I  read, my revulsion for the characters grew line by line, for they are  wasted, empty, and they drown themselves in a swamp of despair and  impotency.  Helen is a vindictive, jealous  mother who takes painful jabs  at anyone in her path; Milton is an incestuous alcoholic who can't own up  to his failures and who is stuck in a sort of paralyzed stupor; and Peyton,  well, she is a genetic carryover of her parents-from her mother she learns  revenge, and from her father, alcoholism.<br />The story is one of severe  despondency, a portrait of lives that have lost their savor and are headed  toward destruction.  Of all the characters in the story, the Negro house  servants come forth as the strongest.  They have a spiritual strength that  contrasts strongly with that of the Loftis.'   The overwhelmingly best  quality of the book, I believe, is the beauty of the prose.  It's like an  epic poem, lyrical and dramatic and sweepingly colorful. And, believe it or  not, I actually enjoyed Peyton's stream-of-consciousness marathon just  before she killed herself.   Styron made it enjoyable and I will always  remember the flightless birds and how they follow Peyton all over New York  and also the $39.95 clock that Peyton perceives as her refuge from the evil  world.  Is this what mental illness is really like?  This book is certainly  one to be read again.	2000-07-15

Every word counts and every story abounds with a subtle grace.  I quickly realized, after the first couple of  stories, that Salter needs to be read in the morning when the brain is  alert.  Try reading him at night and you will quickly become lost in his  quick changing of scenes, his sharp thrusts of dialogue, and his dexterous  symbolism.  I often had to re-read previous paragraphs for clarification.   And when I thought Salter had erred in his writing, I realized instead that  it was I who had erred in my reading.         <br />Dusk won the prestigious  Pen-Faulkner award in 1989.  It is composed of eleven stories whose scenes  take place in both national and foreign settings.  If you love hard-boiled  action scenes, don't read James Salter, for his stories are the opposite:   subtle and meditative.  The characters, well, they do a lot of thinking.   They ponder during their times of loneliness and defeat.   Displacement and  malcontent consume their thoughts and for them the better days lie in the  past, days when they weren't old or divorced or estranged.   I felt like  whispering in their ears, saying &quot;Hey, it can't be all that bad.  Take  a Zoloft and you'll be fine.&quot;  Highly recommended book.	2000-07-12

One will cause you to  ponder its message long after you read it while the other will do nothing  more than fill time.  I did my share of pondering after reading each of  Flannery's stories in this collection.  <br />The stories, for the most part,  take place in the rural South, where we hear the bleating of sheep, the  snorting of pigs, and the mooing of cows.  There is a narrow, but  effective, variety of characters portrayed, from landowner to squatter,  from black to white.  The stories simmer with a religious flavor, and those  who are religious seem to be either haughty and self-righteous or  hopelessly naive.  The religious bigots think their medicine is best and  should be taken by everyone, while they themselves are really the ones  &quot;in need of a physician.&quot;  The intellectuals weave throughout a  story or two, and like some of the religious ones, they treat those around  them with disdain and downright viciousness.  The characters seldom remain  unscathed, however.  Divine justice usually swoops down and executes  revenge upon them, either directly or indirectly.  This revenge often tends  toward the grotesque, and I often finished a story with my jaw hanging  open.  Now I can't wait to digest her complete collection.	2000-07-09

For the first half of the book (or more) there is little conflict.  Martin Dressler has no obstacles before him and his  success builds up layer upon layer, smoothly and without resistance.  I had  to exercise my toughest discipline to get through these pages.  I secretly  found myself cheering for the mafia or some other tough group to raid one  of Martin's restaurants or for some pilferage to threaten Martin's bank  account.  But it never happened.  When the conflict finally arrives, its  effect is diluted by Millhauser's profuse description of each hotel and  restaurant.  Nothing is left out.  It's almost as though the author wrote  the novel exclusively for interior decorators and architects. <br />But there  are some noteworthy aspects of the novel.  Through Martin Dressler we are  reminded of the American Dream and how (theoretically) anybody can rise to  the top despite his or her roots.  Horatio Alger did it, so why can't our  protagonist?   Martin starts out in his father's cigar shop, and through  hard work and persistence, rises to the position of hotel magnate.  He is  not satisfied with mediocrity; he desires only the best.  And he bravely  steps forth from the antiquated world of the Victorian era into the shadow  of the uncertain twentieth century.  Martin's story is a story of what  happens when one goes too far too quickly. As for the prose, I had no  problem with it; I found it smooth and readable and, appropriately, rather  Victorian. These qualities, despite the book's perceived faults, probably  were the very ones that influenced the judges to pin on it the Pulitzer  Prize.  Now, on to other Pulitzers.	2000-07-05

Card discusses a wide range of related topics:  factors that make or break a character, the different  types of stories (Milieu, Idea, Character, Event), how to write emotional  scenes, transformations in the lives of characters, show and tell, and the  benefits and drawbacks of each point-of-view (POV)---among others.  Each  chapter flows with a conversational, succinct style, leaving the reader  with no excuse for misunderstanding. The final chapters on (POV) were well  worth the money I paid for the book.  Card explores POV deeply, deeper than  any other writer of writer's books that I've read.  Between paragraphs, I  thought about my own stories and how they grossly lack POV unity (now back  to the computer to revise). He uses illustrations, draw by Janice Card, to  clarify his points (not that he needed to).  After reading the last  chapter, I set the book down and thought, \\"that's a damned good book.\\"   It's plain that Card loves fiction and has a thorough comprehension of what  good fiction is; this book radiates it fully.	2000-06-25

That's how I felt while reading Faulkner's The Reivers.    This Pulitzer prize novel concerns one  eleven-year-old white boy named Lucius Priest.  Through the mediation of  his father's underlings--Boon Hoggenbeck and Ned McCaslin--Lucius comes of  age in the art of non-virtue.  While Lucius's grandfather is away, the  three of them &quot;borrow&quot; the old man's automobile and embark on a  bumpy journey to Memphis.  On the trip, Lucius sees it all--whoredom, lust,  theft, profanity, gambling--and struggles with these things in the context  of a southern religious tradition.  Though he has every opportunity to turn  back and forgo the trip, he presses on and convinces himself that it's all  too late.  Non-virtue has already embraced him.  On the other hand, Boon  and Ned have no doubts of their lack of virtue, and when they see Lucius  drinking from evil's muddy waters, they just nod their heads (don't think  that the story is grim, for it's down right funny at times).    The  story is addictive, even though the language is rocky and convoluted at  times.  Faulker was no Raymond Carver or Ernest Hemingway; conversely, he  was the ultimate practitioner of the compound-complex sentence.  The  dialogue was so real, especially with Ned and other black folks.  I felt as  though I were standing around the campfire chewing tobacco and thumbing my  suspenders and talking about horse racing.  No wonder this novel hooked the  Pulitzer.  It's quality stuff.	2000-06-20

The Sun Also Rises is indeed one of those books.  To some, it may seem that little really happens in the book; but it does.  At the heart of the story, as someone  already mentioned, Jake Barnes is impotent (castrated), yet he yearns to  hook up with Brett Ashley.  Of course, she knows his predicament and her  ultimate decisions (and his) are based on that knowledge.  <br />Hemingway's  most talked-about quality was his ability to characterize through dialogue.   But some &quot;book doctors&quot; say that he uses too much of it and that  his sense of balance between dialogue and narration is off-kilter.   Sometimes I agree, but I'm usually so wrapped up in Hemingway's magic that  I don't really notice.  <br />My favorite part of the book is the fishing trip  that Barnes and Bill Gorton take prior to attending the festival in Spain.   It made me want to dig out my rod and reel and take a vacation myself.  The  scene reminds me of Hemingway's story &quot;The Big Two-Hearted  River,&quot; except that Barnes is not alone; he has Bill with him.  I also  enjoyed the scene in the bar when the Spaniards absorb the Americans into  their group and share their wine with them. Indeed, alcohol plays an  important role in The Sun Also Rises; a whole cast of down-and-out  characters emerge who drift and drink through life as though nothing else  matters.<br />Hemingway is indeed my favorite writer and this book stands at  the head of my list of all-time beloved novels.	2000-06-17

It's a shame that he was killed in a car crash in the early 1990s.  I think he was just getting warmed up and he certainly had decades of experience yet to share with us.  This collection of stories, like his  novels, shows the conflicts of the human soul.  Stegner liked to write  about young boys coming of age in an often thoughtless society (and  family).  And, as you will learn by reading Jackson Benson's biography of  him, Stegner had an autobiographical bent while writing his fiction.  The  locales of his stories resemble those places where his gambling, drinking  father took him and his family in the early 1900s.  It seems that Stegner  was obsessed with his father, and many of his stories feature a version of  him.  He and his father had a rather poor relationship and Stegner's  writing about him perhaps was his effort at catharsis.  My favorite story  in this collection is Goin' to Town.  The expectations of this poor boy are  shot to .... and he is left to endure the boredom of yet another day.   Excellent stories, excellent writer.	2000-06-13

Joey Becker is a woman in her 50's with  a quest to understand herself and a murder that happened thirty years ago.  This murder has created a silent tension that has followed her through  three successive decades. It is always hiding in the background of her  mind.  In the foreground she seems to live in fairly calm circumstances:  her husband loves her, the kids are grown and out of the house, she has a  successful veterinary practice and a cozy home in a small New England town.   Yet this unresolved tension unnerves Joey and she will do almost anything  (including adultery) to come to terms with it.  Sue Miller is a talented  writer who knows how to bring us (and keep us) readers in her fictional  world.  She rings true.	2000-06-11

I would wake up at 4-5 am every morning and read a  chapter or two, or three, depending on what part of the narrative I  happened to be at.  My job became secondary and, as a result, I was late a  few times.  <br />To be simple, the book tells of a family in New York that  falls apart after the daughter is raped by a young man who belongs to a  prominent family in town. The town turns on the Mulvaneys and each Mulvaney  goes his or her separate way.  Sad, very sad.  <br />Joyce Oates is one of the  masters of literature and she knows just how to braid your heart into taut,  painful strands.  I probably have ten of her books and each one is gothic  and dark and full of emotionally-laden sentences, paragraphs and chapters.   This book is certainly one that you will never forget.	2000-06-05

I have found other words in the Oxford that I have  not found in other dictionaries, such as those words used by many British  authors. I love the dictionary.  I like to feel its solid heftiness in my  hands and I like to read the etymology of each word, which the Oxford so  aptly provides.  The $260 is a great deal.

Because  its  prose is lyrical and expertly crafted; my brain thrived on it.  There  is not one superfluous word.  Every one counts and adds to the total  effect.  What I liked most was how Cunningham tied together three seemingly  separate stories with grace; and I thought they WERE separate until the end  of the book.

O'Brien uses flashback every other chapter, and the transitions are not always clear.  And it was hard to tell whether Cacciato  was some imaginary AWOL soldier (at least toward the end), rather than an  actual man the soldiers were chasing.  Moreover, I got confused when Berlin  hooks up with Sarkin Aung Wan, and she accompanies the men for hundreds of  miles to Paris.  Was she part of Berlin's dream, or did she actually go  along with them?  I often wondered. <br />The prose is excellent, almost  therapeutic.  I enjoyed reading the book out loud while my wife and kids  were upstairs sleeping.  The writing was smooth and lyrical, the images  bold and colorful.  For instance, this passage continues to replay in my  mind:  &quot;...their socks rotted, and their feet turned white and soft so  that the skin could be scraped off with a fingernail, and Stink Harris woke  up screaming one night with a leech on his tongue.&quot;  At times I felt  as though I was there with the soldiers, suffering with them.  <br />How is  one affected by war?  Each soldier in Going After Cacciato is affected  differently, and O'Brien, himself a Vietnam veteran, shows that some men  shrink with fear, others rush forward with clenched teeth, and still others  run away.  War has a way of doing that, I hear.	2000-06-04

I dug the book out from one of my banana boxes and read it in one day. I was amply  rewarded.  Each page added to the intrigue, and I could hardly wait to see  what would become of the characters.  I wanted to learn the fate of Lewis,  who Wolff  characterized as one screwed-up dude.  I actually felt sorry for  him and wondered what experiences in his life could have produced such  behavior.  As for Philip, he is irrevocably changed by his experience at  Fort Bragg and the Vietnam War.  But, in my opinion, the ending came too  abruptly. Wolff simply tells, in a few sentences, what becomes of the  characters after the war.  I think the novel would have been more powerful  if Wolff would have shown a few scenes in the lives of each character.   After I read the last sentence of the book, I wanted more, more than I got.   Maybe an epilogue of sorts.  But Wolff atoned for this deficiency by  revisiting the symbol of the ammunition dump at the end.  Life can be  volatile and each experience (spark) in our lives can have explosive  consequences.	2000-06-04

Like The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men portrays the struggles of California farm laborers in the 1930s.  The workers often  travel from farm to farm, working sixteen-hour days---bucking wheat,  picking cotton, picking fruit---always as employees but never as employers.    The men are victims of their society and one nourishes little hope for  them. They yearn for things they cannot have, such as social positions,  money, land; but they never get them (at least they never hold on to them).   Their dreams remain unfulfilled. As a result of their hardships, they  become bitter and hardened.   <br />Steinbeck's characterizations are superb,  and each person is a unique and vital element in the story.  The dialogue  resonates with truth, the setting and the descriptions are sharp and  picturesque, and the symbolism is effective in its foreshadowing of the  poignant and gruesome climax.  Only criticism I have of the book is  Steinbeck's tendency to \\"tell\\" rather than \\"show.\\"  He had such talent with  description but he insisted on preceding his dialogue with such things as  \\"Candy went on excitedly...\\" and \\"'I ain't so sure,' said George  skeptically.\\"  Other than these distracting \\"tellings,\\" the book was  touching and will certainly remain as one of my favorites.	2000-06-02

And what becomes of all that waiting?  Well, the book aptly tells.  This is a love story set in conservative Chinese culture.  Communism, with its rigid  convention, spills over and provides the backdrop for Lin and Manna's  relationship.  The three main characters represent three tiers of attitude  in this society: Manna represents the modern; Shuyu, the conservative; and  Lin Kong as the one stuck in the middle.  Lin is bored of Shuyu, convinced  that he does not love her, and wants to divorce her.  As for Manna, she is  the carrot and Lin is the mule craning his neck after her.  He plods forth  in his occupation, waiting, and seems to come closer to getting the carrot.   And when he gets the carrot....   I found the writing succinct and colorful  but the pacing of the story was the one thing that made me pick up  Hemingway.   Eighteen years!  It reads like one of those long family  sagas--but not so long.  It seems that Ha Jin was trying to stretch things  out, and by doing so he made the story a little thin.  I wanted more  conflict.  Sure, I got it when Manna was raped and when the villagers  gathered outside the courthouse waiting for Lin Kong.  But overall, the  story is rather slow and dull for my liking.  Feels kind of like a series  of journal entries in the third person.  But I just might read it again.	2000-05-31

After all, Hemingway did write with a highly autobiographical slant, and by reading his fiction, one is able to travel  alongside the famous writer as, for example, he travels with his father to  the Indian Camp, as he lies wounded in an Italian hospital, as he leans on  the rail of the bullfight arena and watches horses get gored by bulls, etc,  etc.  I took my time reading this massive biography, and, simultaneously, I  read each of Hemingway's stories (in the First Forty-nine) as I encountered  them in the bio.  This dual-reading allowed greater understanding of  Hemingway the man and greater appreciation for Hemingway the writer.  Compared to Kenneth Lynn's biography, Mellow's objective treatment is  rather dull, but memorable overall.  Read the last paragraph and enjoy the  beauty of the language.	2000-05-25

Hemingway's writing is sparse on adverbs and adjectives; his is  straight forward English.  This allows the reader to read through each  story without having to reread a paragraph for clarity.  The images and  emotions that Hemingway evokes through his prose are clear and sharp.  At  times I felt as though I were right there with Nick Adams throwing my line  into the fast-moving stream; as though I were in the bull-fighting arena  watching Manuel Garcia perform his veronicas; as though I were holding  Frances Macomber's gun as the buffalo was charging at him.  Some of the  stories I didn't particularly like (On the Quai at Smyrna, Mr. and Mrs.  Elliott) but the strong stories made up for them.  No wonder Hemingway won  the Nobel Prize.

The prose flows smoothly like his thoughts and Butler must  get credit for this.  Beautiful language. And most of the story takes place  in Halloway's mind, where his brain tries to make sense of his landscape of  lovers.  He remembers the parts of women's bodies as though they are  religious idols:  the insteps, the toes, the rounded shoulders, the  rose-tinted nipples, and just about every other crevice and appendage that  a woman has.  All these memories create nervous conflict.  His wife, once  the victim of incest, turns deeply religious---fanatical---and Halloway  must tread lightly around her struggles or risk losing both her and, more  importantly, their son. I enjoyed the book, and if I have anything critical  to say about it, I'd have to accuse it as being long-winded and monotonous  at times.  Read it anyway and form your own opinion.	2000-02-26

Sometimes the reading was difficult for me because of the maritime jargon used.  Often I found myself consulting my Third New  International for clarification. What I loved most of all was Proulx's  colorful, terse descriptions.  I could almost see the snakes writhing under  the large blanket when she describes the tumultous, white-capped sea.  I  liked Quoyle, had some sympathy for him, and even ended up liking him in  the end.  The plot is pure literature, full of hidden meanings and  innuendoes. Sure, the book is full of sentence fragments, but Proulx  executes them so well. This is certainly a book I would read again.	2000-01-08

The book swells with suspense, characterization, believable dialogue, and yes, even a sexual moment or two. Good literature  with the bleak ending and all.  Don't hesitate to read this book.	1999-12-25

He wanders from bed to bed, even sleeping with his best friend's wife.  I did enjoy the scene when Danny visits old Uncle Laredo, an onery, almost  decrepit man who slices the throats of goats without a second thought.  But  much of the book was hum-drum and even quite depressing, especially toward  the end of the book. Danny wanders from place to place, trying, struggling,  to find happiness, but never does.  If you want a lesson on how to be  unhappy, read this book.	1999-05-16

Updike really knows how to sew together a novel that one can relate to.  He discusses common experiences, common relationships,  those that all of us have at least experienced once.  Rabbit is a character  who I grew to enjoy and hate at the same time.  His story is one of  hopelessness and pessimism and a flawed moral character, and he senses that  the end is near, but does not take sincere steps to remedy the situation.  He feels the awful dread that accompanies chronic disease, and it is  interesting how he copes with it.  Truthfully, I think Updike could have  spent less time on the trivial; pages and pages are used to describe the  most mundane topics, like television commercials.   Overall, I enjoyed the  novel and continue to reflect upon its content and message, even weeks  after finishing it.  For some reason I sort of miss Rabbit.	1999-05-12

David H. Smith, son of the famed Mormon prophet Joseph Smith, never lived to know his father; he missed the  fatherly embrace by five months.  Much to Brigham Young's dismay, David  became affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day  Saints, and was one of its most effective and revered missionaries.  Mental  illness overcame him, and he spent the last three decades of his life in a  mental hospital.  Avery performed wonderfully well in framing his life  story, using personal and official RLDS church correspondence.  I felt the  heartache and pain that David's family experienced as they struggled, hoped  and despaired. This book was so engaging that I actually read the entire  book in less than two weeks (which, for me, is noteworthy when considering  any non-fiction work over 100 pages). David Smith's life was replete with  pathos and unfulfilled expectations (he was destined to take his father's  place as Prophet).  The book also adequately describes the perpetual  tension that existed, and at times does currently exist, between the Utah  and the RLDS Mormon churches.  Even though Avery placed an inordinant  emphasis on Smith's poetical works, I would recommend this book to all.	1999-02-22
