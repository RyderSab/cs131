The recipes are terrific.  Be sure to try the nut cookies.   <br /> <br />Goldy keeps finding bodies, much like Jessica Fletcher.  Being acquainted with Goldy could be dangerous to your health.  This time, she finds her abusive ex-husband dead and Goldy leads the list of suspects in his murder.  Before that even happens, Goldy is injured by someone trying to sabotage her catering business.  We see her and her staff scrambling to replace the spoiled food and ransacking of her new banquet facility.  Add to that problem, an obnoxious health inspector and a gossip columnist who reports everything in an unfavorable light.  What secrets do these two have?  There's plenty of secrets and connections to discover, relationships to be mended, plus new and old friends who may not be what they seem.  There's plenty for Goldy to be stressed about and what does she do when she gets upset?  Cook.  <br /> <br />I've read all the Goldy books and I really liked this one.  It doesn't have as much humor as some of the previous ones but, it does have a well-crafted mystery.  It also explores the psychological aspects about the death of an ex-husband and the father of her child especially well.  <br />	2005-02-16

Romantic mystery is my favorite genre and that's exactly what this is.  The author puts our heroine is sometimes perilous, often funny situations--even when she's finding dead bodies.  Emily's grandmother and her Midwestern sensibilities make the most outlandish things seem plausible.  If anything, this book could use a little more romance but, that's promised in the next book in this series so, we'll see what happens.  I highly recommend this one.  You'll learn about Seniors Tours to Switzerland, the sights in Switzerland, hotel service in Switzerland, the police, and the wonderful people from Iowa and others on this tour plus, you find out who done it and why.  This is the perfect book to take on vacation--even if you're not on a Seniors Tour or going to Switzerland.  It's just great fun.  Enjoy!	2004-01-15

There are a lot of problems with this book starting with too many characters to keep track of.  I found myself having to back up every few pages just to figure out who some of these people were.  I know it's set in a small town but, we really don't need to meet everyone at once.  I'd also like to know how Hannah earns any money.  She gives away more cookies than she sells!<br />Hannah also needs a romance.  It's hinted that there might be one in her future but, I was reading this book NOW and would have appreciated a little romance.  <br />Another problem is that her cop brother-in-law asks her to interview and help out in a murder investigation.  Oh yeah?  Do the cops in your community ask you to investigate for them?<br />On the plus side, the cookie recipes all sound delicious.  I haven't tried any because I was busy reading the book.	2003-06-18

I'm not too familiar with the terminology of hockey but, I think a \\"hat trick\\" is supposed to be a really good thing to achieve.  If that's the case, this book scored a \\"hat trick\\" with me.  Jane is smart enough to capitalize on her relationship with Luc, both personally and professionally.  Luc is smart enough to recognize the attraction to Jane, even though she doesn't appear to be his type.  The author does a really terrific of bringing these characters to life for me.  It doesn't hurt that there is extended foreplay to some steamy sex.  Also, I'm not into tattoos but, I'd sure like to get an eyeful of Luc's.	2003-03-29

She loved food and not only cooked it professionally but, was almost obsessed with it.  She was substantially overweight as a result.  When she was hired as spa chef at a posh Hawaiian resort, she rose to the challenge of coming up with delicious, satisfying and healthful food.  She ended up losing 80 lbs. and developing a new cuisine which she shares with us in her book.  <br />One of the things I especially like about these recipes is that they consider texture to be as key an element as taste, aroma and calories.  A lot of the diets forget that.  I think that's why liquid diets don't work.  Chewing is one of the most satisfying aspects of eating.  <br />The baked asparagus has become one of my all-time favorites.  I make it often and have passed on the recipe to many different folks.  <br />I hope that KD includes nutritional information in her next book so that all those whiners would shut up.	2002-07-29

California cuisine has long been known for its innovations.  In \\"Dim Sum Dead\\", we have a caterer who takes great care to appeal to the tastes of all the guests while she's actively snooping and questioning them.  What chutzpah!<br />At first, I wanted to read this book solely to see if the Mah Jongg referred to in the description was the Mah Jongg I'm familiar with.  I play in a regular weekly game.  There are some differences between Farmer's description of how the game is played and how it's actually played but, this didn't diminish my enjoyment of the book.  <br />Although I enjoyed the Mah Jongg references, there was so much more here.  The menu ideas were terrific.  We also have a romantic element as well as a mystery and a murder to be solved.  Madeline is sure one sharp cookie and a most persistent sleuth.	2002-05-22

We were on the last side of the last tape when we arrived at our daughter's house and, as much as I wanted to see my daughter and son-in-law, I wanted to hear the end of the story right then.  Chris Noth and Robert Guilliame give a compelling performance.  Noth makes the bad guys sound really spooky and scary and Guilliame makes Alex sound both smart and vulnerable.  <br />A lot of the book's shortcomings are diminished or, at least, not so noticeable in the audio version.  Listening to this abridged version gives you the essence of Patterson in a most entertaining format.	2002-05-22

This book started slow and I almost gave up on it.  To be honest, a vendetta between two old Italian men is not what I want to read about.  This novel has a lot of flashbacks to the vendetta story, regarding past injuries and injustices and the current situation involving the killing of one of the protagonists.  I gave this book a chance because I wanted to read a story with Judy Carrier as the main character.  If you've read any of the author's previous works, you know who Judy is.  In this book, we learn a little more--particularly about her work ethic.<br />Judy seems to work more hours than there are in one day.  She works almost exclusively on this one case and she's not getting paid for it although she racks up some pretty hefty expenses.  There are a lot of loose ends here and a lot of items introduced but, never explained.  For example, there is a character named Murphy in Judy's office mentioned a couple of times as a &quot;sidebar&quot; and then the conflict between the two characters is never mentioned again.   <br />The only character we really learn a lot about is Pigeon Tony.  I mention that because that's what I really missed the most in this book--the strong characterizations from her previous works.  This is still an interesting read.  She's a good writer and there's lot of action here but, just not one of this author's best.	2002-03-22

This book explains this healthful way of eating and cooking.  The emphasis is on fruits, vegetables, grains, pasta, fish, seafood and poultry.  If you're looking for red meat recipes, this is not the book for you.  Most of the recipes can be prepared in 30 minutes or less.  Complete nutritional information is provided for each recipe.  <br />I don't believe any of the recipes included any salt so, this would be a boon for those of us who are supposed to cut down on salt.  There are a number of terrific muffin, bread, and pancake recipes.  The soups, salads, fish, seafood, poultry, and especially the veggie recipes provide a wide variety of choices.  My one gripe is that there are very few dessert recipes and the few that they've included, with the exception of the pumpkin pie, were not very appealing to me.  The pumpkin pie recipe uses a crust made with gingersnaps and graham cracker crumbs which is quite good and makes it much lower in fat and cholesterol.	2001-11-18

Debbie Macomber is a good writer and I've read quite a few of her books.  This one has way too many characters to keep track of.

Interestingly enough, it's written by a man presenting the story as a woman (photojournalist Jordan Glass)and using the first tense as the narrative form.  There is a good mystery and a love story happening here.  Like one of the previous reviewers, I think most of the book is rather well-done but, the ending and/or resolution of the mystery is rather contrived and unsatisfying.  Mr. Iles also spends a lot of time discussing locations and the mechanics of getting to and from these locations.  Things like the ride from the airport, what kind of vehicle was used and who was driving are totally unneccessary.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book and look forward to reading some of the author's other works.	2001-10-16

Dr. Shapiro apparently thinks the answer to eating less calories and fat is NO MEAT! How can you compare a real beef hamburger to a veggie burger? Chicken nuggets vs. Lentil Soup? Is this guy nuts or what? The other calorie and fat saver is NO REAL SALAD DRESSING! Duh. Another tip is hold the cheese. Save your money and buy a Vegan Vegetarian cookbook instead of these. That's the kind of food the good doctor wants you to eat in order to lose weight. The dessert book suggests fresh fruit and is real big on frozen fudgsicles and dreamsicles. It suggests that this will satisfy your cravings for brownies or Napoleons. I don't think so but, they are a reasonable alternative when you just have to have something sweet.	2001-09-04

I liked meeting the principal characters, the romance and sex were hot, and there was a murder mystery with psychological implications, too.  What more could you ask?  The dialogue and exhanges between Jaine, Sam, and her friends were lively and fun.  The mystery element was not as finely handled as most of the other details of the book and that's why I can't give it 5 stars.  It was kinda like the Columbo TV series.  They tell you who the murderer is and then you have to wait for the other characters to catch on.  For some, the realization comes too late.	2001-09-04

After all, it's a convenient way of eating chocolate without the mess.  She needs a &quot;fix&quot; especially when she's involved in a stressful situation.  There's plenty of those in this book and for those of us who could really empathize with the character, there are lots of M &amp; M moments.  Ms. Isenberg uses a lot of interesting devices to move the plot along.  Most of the chapters start with an e-mail or letter to or from Bel.  This lets you in on what's going on without hitting you over the head with it.  I like it!<br />Teacher Bel has a lot of stuff going on in her life.  I would have liked a little more about her relationship with Sol.  It seems to be relegated to the back burner in this book.  This is a character-driven book and the author has created some great characters--most of which would be interesting to meet.  The mystery part is a little flimsy but, that can be forgiven because it's fun just reading what Bel and her cohorts are going to do next.  I read this book on the plane from Vegas to Dallas and I didn't really mind that the flight was about a half-hour late because I was really into the book.	2001-08-14

Yes, like many of your other reviewers, I have read ALL of the books in the Stephanie Plum series.  I even read this author BEFORE she created Stephanie and I really enjoyed her work.  I think she was sleepwalking through this one.  Her descriptions of the characters and situations were what made the previous books fun to read.  This one is sorely lacking.  For instance, there is a scene where Stephanie and Lula end up in the pit at a mud wrestling bar.  I've never been to a mud wrestling bar so it's hard for me to come up with a picture of what it's like. More vivid and colorful descriptions could have made this a memorable scene.  Instead, it comes across rather flat. Also, the author assumes that the reader already knows a lot of stuff about the recurring characters without filling us in.  Poor Joe Morelli!  He's relegated to the back burner in favor of the dog.  C'mon, Janet, you can do much better.	2001-07-22

This book got a great review in the Dallas Morning News so, I decided to give it a shot.  The writing is terrific.  Riordan does marvelous descriptions of most of the characters and the various San Antonio neighborhoods.  One gripe in the description department, what does Tres (the principal character) look like?  Tres' physical appearance, other than his injuries, are glossed over.  I want a picture of this guy, please.  The mystery behind the murders is not all that puzzling.  Riordan gives you a lot of clues before the final enlightenment.  <br />The characters in this book are fresh and different--not at all run-of-the-mill, and that includes the bad guys.  If you are looking to escape from your everyday world and meet a decidedly cool teacher/private eye then, this is the book for you.  People from his past and present collide in rather unexpected ways.	2001-07-15

This book sounded absolutely adorable with its murder occurring in the beauty shop.  Some days when our hair doesn't come out looking so hot, I'm sure murder is on the mind of some of the patrons.  Marla (the principal character) sounded like someone we'd want to know.  I know South Florida as my folks have lived there for quite some time.  All the elements of a book I should like were in place.<br />Let's start with the writing.  The author describes a lot of stuff that doesn't move along the action at all.  She hints at back stories for some of the characters but, doesn't give us the details then, plops them in at inappropriate spots.  Why not tell us about the girls at the salon?  The mystery is weak, too.  It doesn't take much to figure this one out at all.  Let's hope that Ms. Cohen either improves her writing skills or gets a better editor, please.	2001-07-15

Claire works in the Oregon state custom license plate division so, one assumes she's familiar with a lot of the cutesy combinations people come up with for their plates.  The author capitalizes on this by giving us clues in the form of these license plates at the end of certain chapters.  She even obliges by giving us a Key to License Plate Terms near the end of the book--just in case we can't figure them out.  <br />I'll admit I was drawn to the gimmick at first but, the story is good.  When her aunt dies, Claire inherits the contents of her trailer.  She is intrigued by a painting she finds that people keep telling her is worthless but, she pursues it anyway with intriguing results.  We find out the Claire is a smart girl with good intuitive instincts except when it comes to men.  Hopefully, she will improve her skills in the romantic department in the future.

It has absolutely nothing to do with the story.  I suspected that it might have some recipes in it.  Boy, was I ever wrong!<br />Tory (our heroine) is a delight.  She's in a bad situation but, her sense of humor really saves the day.

I have been a big fan of Robert B. Parker's for many years and was told that if I liked Parker, I would like Crais.  There is a similarity as both detectives have powerful sidekicks with pasts that are only alluded to.  In LA Requiem, we find out a lot about the mysterious Joe Pike, our hero Elvis Cole's sidekick.  This book is a lot grittier than the previous Cole books and at first, it was rather a turn-off.  As I read more of the book, I couldn't help but get involved in the story and felt that the more serious tone really suited this particular tale.  Elvis is still a smartass but, he really gets involved in his friend's plight and his romantic interest takes an unexpected turn.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes modern day detective fiction.  I would suggest that anyone who hasn't read one or more of the earlier books in this series should do so before reading this one.	2001-05-15
