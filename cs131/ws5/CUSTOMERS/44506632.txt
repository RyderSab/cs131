I really have more questions as opposed to an actual review. Currently I am well-versed in giving the Evil-Eye, so will possessing the string give me the ability draw mystical forces from Rachel's Tomb and increase my powers tenfold? Will I also be able to expand my telepathic abilities so that I may discuss the negative attributes of the Zohar while transmitting my thoughts and commands to Demi Moore and Britney Spears? Will Rachel astral project Herself into this realm of reality to teach me the ancient black arts? How long does it take to master the strengths of molecular inhibition?	2005-08-18

After reading an article on girl violence in Newsweek, this book was sited as a great resource to further understand this emerging problem in schools.<br /><br />Too bad it didn't live up to the hype. Far to many repeats of already stated information...the book was like reading in circles.<br /><br />By far the most unforgiveable crime was the lack of examples provided. Several introductory pieces were used...all of about 4 or 5. Granted, my main reason for reading this book was to read the sensational horror stories, but the book completely bailed on providing us voyeuristic readers that guilty pleasure! I was also curious about the relationship of violence in regards to feminism and the new \\"Sheroes\\" of pop culture such as Buffy, The Bride from Kill Bill and other mentions (Alias, Catwoman, etc.) but they were lightly (and I'm talking a few, faint sentences) touched upon.	2005-07-15

While I would never do the things to my children that this book advocates, I can't help but laugh at all the pseudo-torture techniques that are laid out verbatim.<br /><br />Like the Marquis de Sade, Lisa Whelchel spins scenario after scenario of ways to make your children mind their elders and pay for their sins. My personal favorites include \\"saucing\\" a lying tongue, making your child run barefoot through doggie doo in the backyard, splashing a bucket of ice cold water in a toddler's face and emptying the garbage can on their bedroom floor! Each punishment is also concluded with a psalm (from the toolbox) to further drill it into your child's mind that God = pain. Can't wait to see the next generation of christians this will turn out.<br /><br />Lisa also informs us of the time she took young son Tucker to a psychologist and how he told about Daddy's spankings. Lisa said she gripped the steering wheel in fear just knowing that Child Protective Services had been called, but when they never showed up she chalked it all up to praying to Jesus really hard.

Guess Laura doesn't seem to think so. These books are always a hoot to read because they portray wingnuts as nothing more than paranoid victims who think the Reds will be knocking on the door at any minute. Soooo 1983. If you've read Coulter, Hannity etc then no need picking this up. Ingraham comes off as a rank amatuer and copycat. Nothing new here, folks.	2003-09-17

Fun and interesting read on the current state of affairs involving our corporate-controlled media, military and lives. Even more interesting to note is the wingnuts who leave a 1-star rating and do not leave a name. What does that say about them now?	2003-09-10

Yet they do not list any of the \\"lies\\" as to why they make this assumption. I guess a lot of pre-schoolers got ahold of the keyboard, who knows? As for \\"lies,\\" how about them WMDs?	2003-06-25
