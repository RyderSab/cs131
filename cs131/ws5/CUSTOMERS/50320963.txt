US	50320963	RZP6ODVYC6G0K	1578567459	246054935	Expiration Date	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A great christian novel about faith and free will	What would you do if you had the ability to know when a person would die just by touching them?<br /><br />Expiration Date is the second novel by Eric Wilson and part of a 5-book series that focuses on each of the five senses.  Expiration Date focuses on touch because whenever Clay Ryker touches someone he sees the date they are going to die imprinted on his hands.<br /><br />Ryker is returning to Junction City, the place where he grew up as a basketball star and a place where he and many others have many secrets they want to keep hidden.  Ryker meets Henna, a former highschool classmate while returning home on a bus.  Henna reads his palm, recites some mysterious words, and somehow gives Clay the ability to know when a person will die just by touching them.<br /><br />The best Christian novels are ones that focus on relationships, and in Exiration Date Ryker is returning home because of the impending failure of his marriage to Jenni.  Other relationships include his son Jason, his high school friend Bill Scott and his high school sweetheart, Mylisha.<br /><br />Wilson weaves a complicated tale where most characters are hiding something.  Some characters are given little background, like the \\"Sarge,\\" but all have a place in the story.  Wilson introduces the novel stating that he wanted to focus on the struggle between free will and predestination.  Ryker embodies this test by knowing the date of death of many friends and family and struggling to keep the deaths from happening.  He succeeds and times and he fails as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel a lot.  Wilson states on his website he likes Dean Koontz and I can see a lot of Koontz in this book.  At times, you'll wander whats real and what isn't but in the end everything gets resolved.<br /><br />I enjoyed the realism of this Christian novel.  All the characters have real problems, and there is a lot of implied violence, cursing, drinking, drug use and sex.  Just like in real life.  One part I objected to is midway through the book at the conclusion of Clay's hike.  I don't want to reveal what Clay does but it seems like such a weak thing to do and I don't think he was in the frame of mind where an action like that would be necessary.  Still, it had to be done to advance the plot and the story takes off from there.  There is also an ongoing subplot revolving around Lenin, Rasputin, and the Russian revolution of 1917.  At times, it seems like it really doesn't belong even though the book concludes with it and hints a possible sequelI objected to is midway through the book at the conclusion of Clay's hike.

Reichs writes in the female coroner genre currently inhabited by authors that I've read such as Tess Gerrittsen, Linda Fairstein and Patrica Cornwell.  I may read Gerrittsen again and will not read anymore Cornwell or Fairstein, but Monday Mourning was a great book that had me wanting to read more of the series.<br /><br />Monday Mourning is narrated by Tempe Brennan, who works both in North Carolina and Montreal.  I can't recall her exact position but know she is involved in looking at bones in suspicious deaths.  Three sets of bones have been found in a pizza parlour basement and Brennan begins looking into their origin and whether there was foul play involved in the death.  She quickly finds that the bones were that of teenagers and she sets out to find who could have possibly had access to the pizza parlour basement.  Upon finding the previous tenants of the building, more and more clues come in about the identity of the possible killer as well as the identities of the victims.<br /><br />Like other books in this genre, there are several subplots including Anne, Brennen's distraught friend, and Det. Andrew Ryan, Brennan's lover.  Reichs writes in a quick rapid pace that doesn't dwell on subplots too long, and when it does, makes them interesting.<br /><br />The mystery in this novel felt real because in some ways it ties into real life murderers.  I enjoyed several references to real life killers and cases made by the author, many that I had read about at Crimelibrary.com.  If you enjoy the authors mentioned in the opening paragraph, then give Reichs a try because I think she is the best of them all.	2005-09-26
US	50320963	R2ROJRW85YSJYI	045120932X	142953671	The Marching Season	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A tightly written thriller with fun characters	The Marching Season is a new novel by Daniel Silva but also a continuation of the characters first introduced in \\"The Mark of the Assassin.\\"  Michael Osborne and the spy known as October return in a thriller set around Northern Ireland and the hatred between the Protestants and the Catholics.  This novel is a stand-alone novel, yet it reveals too much about Mark of the Assassin for me to want to go back and read it.  The novel opens with the Ulster Freedom Brigade initiating a new round of terrorist attacks in Northern Ireland because they do not like the peace brought about by the Good Friday accords.  The US president appoints Douglas Cannon as the new US ambassador to London to try and bring stability to the region and fight for the Good Friday accords.  Sen. Cannon also happens to be former CIA operative Michael Osborne's father-in-law.<br /><br />Osborne rejoins the CIA to aid his father-in-law in stopping the terrorist attacks.  Ultimately, the terrorists decide to target Ambassador Cannon and Michael must find out who is behind the attacks before it is too late.  Operating behind the scenes is a top secret organization that exists to promote violence around the world, regardless of which side it is.  This organization enlists the aid of October to carry out a final mission against Osborne.  The ending has some good action and a surprising twist and ends on a positive note.<br /><br />This is my 3rd Silva novel and I enjoyed it more that Confessor, a Gabriel Allon novel.  The Unlikely Spy is still by far the best Silva novel I read but the Marching Season is a good one with a solid deep plot and intriguing characters.	2005-09-15

Terrance D'Arcy and Val Haines are rivals in business and rivals in love.  Val married Stephani but Terrance wanted her and soon set out to take her from Val.  The story opens with Val Haines awakening in a jail cell having no memory of who he is.  Soon, he is assumed to be dead because of a plot set in motion by Terrance.  Val slowly regains his memory and soon remembers everything, but author Bunn chooses to reveal the plot and the Haines' past slowly, increasing the tension and suspense.<br /><br />Bunn does a great job of establishng a heartbreaking situation.  Val Haines is by no means a great man, but he has suffered through a painful divorce with a wife who has cheated on him.  But who is right and wrong is not easy to figure out, especially when everyone's lives are being manipulated by Terrance D'Arcy.  D'Arcy, as a villian, is almost over the top, with decade spanning ambitions for evil finally coming to fruition in this novel.<br /><br />The above 2 paragraphs were written before I finished the novel, and the book's latter 2/3rds turn out to be a meandering mess.  Bunn follows the story from Val Haines point of view and from Terrance D'Arcy. He alternates point of view every other chapter which keeps the reader from ever becoming comfortable with the story line.  The hook of the book, that Val Haines has awakened without a memory and the world thinks he is dead, is resolved quickly and thus any suspense built up is gone.  Author Bunn seems extremely focused on plot and therefore ignores the characters.  Haines is supposedly attracted to Audrey D'Arcy, yet no past is given between them.  Haines also supposedly remembers everything he forgot, and that memory should explain what he was doing in a seedy bar early in the morning at the beginning of the novel, yet that is never explained.  Also, why did he lose his memory?  An explanation is given but the memory loss gimick in the end just comes off as a cheap plot device.<br /><br />This is supposedly a Christian novel, although there isn't any mention of God or faith anywhere.  This novel doesn't have any objectionable material so can pass as an acceptable novel to discerning Christians.  I final complaint has to do with the treatment of Val's ex wife.  Glimpses of Paradise, a great Christian novel by James Scott Bell, has a similar problem but is strong enough to overcome it.  Because of Terrance D'Arcy, Val and Stephanie split up.  Terrance is an evil man who devoted his entire life to destroying Val.  So although Stephanie had an affair with Val, is it entirely her fault.  Also, Stephanie believes her child is Terrance's or is it or does she really beleive that.  Bunn sets up Val's relationship with Stephanie to be the most tragic and the most in need of redemption.  Also, Bunn isn't clear on who knows what.  In my opinion, this relationship could have been saved if all the characters knew the truth.  Either they did and chose not to act, or didn't and Bunn was a lazy writer, but in the end because I'm not sure is reason enough to be disappointed in Bunn's writing.<br /><br />I'm surprised how disappointed I was in this novel because it starts out great.  However, the premise of a man thought to be dead and waking without a memory is dealt with quickly and all we are left with is a cat and mouse chase and business thriller and characterization is pushed to the back burner leaving the reader wanting more depth to the characters.at is never explained.

I read a review of the book below and am wondering it it contained too much information and might have spoiled the ending, because right now I'm only halfway through the book.  So far, the sense I get is that there are no good guys or bad guys, but there is right and wrong and each character spends time flirting with both sides.  Sherman McCoy is a man who has all the trappings of success but his little empire is threatening to crumble becasue of his mounting debt, his affairs, and oh ya, a little hit and run accident that he should have reported to the police but didn't.  McCoy, as a character, doesn't have many redeeming qualities.  However, as political and cultural forces slowly unite to turn against him, I find myself rooting for him to stand up for all that is bad in society:  the tabloid press, the Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton types that don't really care about the truth and the district attorneys looking for politcal gain.<br /><br />Wolfe covers every aspect of this hit run, from its innocent beginnings to the outlandish policical case that it will turn into.  Now 2/3rds of the way book, it seems Wolfe holds none of the characters in too much regard.  Everyone from the victim, the accuser, the lawyers and the press are pandering to their weakest traits.  I think that's where the title of the book comes from.  What happens when you throw a bunch of people looking out only for themselves into one volitile situation.  You get this book.<br /><br />Having now finished the book, I see why it is considered a classic.  Wolfe tells a great story.  Sherman McCoy is a bad man, motivated by money and seduced by younger women.  But when he gets involved in the accident, he slowly begins to change.  He is almost forced to change because all the other people involved in his life are worse than he is.  Yet they aren't behaving badly.  Wolfe just portrays these people for who they are.  Kramer is the district attorney who seizes the case against McCoy as a way to make a better life for himself.  He does what anyone else in the situation would do.  Reverend Bacon is typical of the race mongering civil rights activistis who put themselves above those they supposedly serve.  Peter Fallow is a journalist who would be nuts to refuse to cover a story that is given to him.<br /><br />I recommend this book because it points what can happen when selfishness overtakes people's lives.  And it is an entertaining story that shows what happens when liberal politicians put their own success ahead of the truth.are.

Kidd, don't think his first name was ever mentioned, is a computer hacker who tries to find out what happened to \\"Bobby\\" when he is no longer online.  Bobby is the ultimate hacker that has info that if it is in the wrong hands, could destroy many people including Kidd and his squeaze LuEllen.<br /><br />This book draws on some past characters I was unfamiliar with, including John, a black man with a militant past that he too wants hidden.  They find Bobby murdered in his home and know they can't call the authorities without bringing suspicion upon themselves.  Kidd draws attention to the case in a unique way and then after that its up to Kidd, LuEllen and John to track down the most valuable thing in the world, Bobby's laptop computer.  Bobby's computer contains enough hacked information to destroy the USA.  Kidd must operate outside the law while at the sametime work with Senators and congressmen.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but it didn't overwhelm me like the first Prey novel I read.  Kidd seems a lot like Lucas Davenport to me.  Sure, he doesn't know how to use a gun and isn't a good fighter, but he is smart and cunning and comes across as a man without much depth, or at least we are not given a history to sympathize with why Kidd is the way he is.<br /><br />I have yet to read Sandord novel I didn't enjoy and will probably go back and read the first Kidd novel and then the rest of the series.	2005-08-08

We are introduced to the killer, Koop, at the opening.  Koop is your standard killer who had a horrible childhood and is now taking it out on women.  Koop has a few unique characteristics such as picking out victims at used book stores because they are usually timid and shy.<br /><br />Sanford builds the suspense by following Koops every move so even if the cops don't know what Koop is doing.  Sandford also does another excellent think by picking out a woman that Koop is stalking, and following her story as well.  So now the reader is rooting for Koop to get caught and for the potential victim to be saved.<br /><br />Lucas is back as well, still recovering from and injury he received in the last book and now shacking up with Weather, also from Winter Prey.  Lucas has accepted a political position as a detective that will take on the toughest cases.  This case gets a lot of publicity when Koop starts killing in order to get close to Sara Jensen, the potential victim mentioned above.  The detective work is the usual, except Koop does something early on that told me exactly how the cops would find out who the killer is.<br /><br />This is a good book, but not the best in the series.  Even after six books, we still don't know much about what makes Lucas Davenport tick.  At least in this book he is faithful to Weather.	2005-08-04

Ned Kelly is the main character of the book, a man from a family of criminals who is trying to go straight but is drawn into one big crime with his childhood friends for the chance at a million bucks.  Something goes wrong and suddenly Ned has no money and is on the run from the FBI because they think he stole a $60 million worth of art and killed 5 people.<br /><br />FBI agent Ellie Shurtleff is an art specialist who links the missing art, the murder of Ned's friends and the murder of a sexy woman Ned was seeing together.  Ellie joins in the pursuit of Ned and through her investigations begins to think Ned might actually be innocent.<br /><br />That's enough plot detail.  Now for my opinion on the book.  There is some depth to Ned's character, but really none to Ellie's and this is a problem since the two basically team up to solve the mystery of the book.  Also, I don't know if Ned ever was a lifeguard.  I guess he was at some point.  There are a lot of twists and turns and the book follows the usual Patterson style of short chapters, tons of italics, and cliffhangers at the ends of several chapters.  Also, at several times, Ned or Ellie makes a key discovery and what they discovered isn't revealed until later.  This can be a problem because I started wondering if I missed something.<br /><br />For a change, this Patterson novel actually has a good climax with some twists that are surprising.  As much as Patterson's books seem to blend together, I actually like this book and recommend it.  The plot is fast moving and fun and the twists keep coming and are somewhat interesting.  If you want something to read on a vacation, pick up this quick and easy read from Patterson/Gross.	2005-07-29

John Katzenbach is an accomplished author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels (The Analyst), so I was surprised at how bad The Shadow Man was.  The premise of the plot is that four very old Jewish people, survivors of the Holecaust, believe they have seen the \\"Shadow Man\\".  The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps.  These four old people feared the Shadow Man more than anything.  When one of them is killed, a retired police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is.  Meanwhile, the Miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly Jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect.<br /><br />Eventually, Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man, a man of pure evil.  As the book villian, it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s.  Also, this book barely touches on WWII, yet purports at times to be a novel about WWII.  I've read a lot of great WWII novels, and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s.  But setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasn't too exciting.  It wasn't exciting primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years?  Why was he starting to kill now?  The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill.<br /><br />Finally, I realized I didn't like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages.  The entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story.  If you take away the WWII angle, this novel is bad.  The WWII angle adds some excitement, but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII better than this one does.<br /><br />The review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated...\\"Katzenbach (Just Cause) has some good Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here, but the book is burdened by flat characterization, a slow pace, an odd, unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing.\\"nbach (Just Cause) has some good Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here, but the book is burdened by flat characterization, a slow pace, an odd, unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing.\\"	2005-07-26

First, it is a solid historical novels with 2 characters I care about who go on a lifelong journey full of mistakes, failure, success and religious conversion.  Second, it is also a novel where the author takes the characters in a different direction than what I thought he should have, and (as I'll describe later) gives a lot of suffering to a character because of a secret she held that could have been avoided if she had just told Doyle the truth.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good Christian novel.  Set in the early 1900s, Glimpses of Paradise reads like any other secular novel, which I think was a good thing.  Bell doesn't spend too much time showing off his knowledge about the time period.  Instead, he establishes the strong characters of Zee Miller and Doyle Lawrence who are good friends and might even be in love.  The class system of the time forces them to see each other in secret while Doyle is pressured to marry an upperclass girl who likes him.  After reading the first part of the book, I just knew Zee and Doyle were meant to be together.<br /><br />Doyle goes off to college in preparations to become a lawyer and Zee tries to join the local theater to fulfill aspirations to be an actress.  Then Doyle enlists in the army and is shipped to Europe for WWI.  At the same time, Dee meets a theater man named Desmond Nichols who at first is nice to her then shows a side of evil.<br /><br />Doyle is drastically changed by WWI and Dee is changed by her encounter with Desmond Nichols.  I don't want to go into too much more without giving away the plot.  Zee fulfills her dreams of becoming an actress but in the process cuts her ties from her father, who was a preacher, and her religious upbringing.  Doyle returns from Europe haunted by the war and it takes years for him to recover from the shock of war.<br /><br />I enjoyed the twists and turns the novel took and felt the climax was good and satisfying, but if I were plotting the book, I would have taken it in a totally different direction.  Bell fails in one area, in my opinion.  The summary on the book says Zee has a dark secret.  This secret has obviously changed her.  She has turned from God and her past, including Doyle.  But Bell continuously gives hints that Zee realized the errors of her ways and several times Zee has an opportunity to change but doesn't.  Also, when her secret is revealed, it is done so happazardly only to move the plot forward, and not to try and explain Zee's past or to help others help her to change.  Zee was written as a good person and was set up to be redeemed as a character.  I'm not saying she isn't redeemed in the end, but it isn't done the way it should be in relation to her secret.  Even when Zee reveals her secret to Doyle after they have met again in Los Angeles, she doesn't tell him the entire truth.<br /><br />It's hard to review a book when my complaints were about the plot and conclusion.  But I did enjoy the book, even if the ending was somewhat disappointing.  One stregnth the book had was its description of Hollywood in the 1920s and the inclusion of some famous names as well as Kit Shannon, a character from his other series of books.wists and turns the novel took and felt the climax was good and satisfying, but if I were plotting the book, I would have taken it in a totally different direction.

These 2 novels seem very similar to me.  They are fast paced and told 3rd person from the point of view of the main character.  Velocity was a great book full of suspense and intrigue and I recommend it.<br /><br />Billy Wiles, your average bartender, has received a note that someone is going to die.  If he goes to the police, it is an old spinster, if he doesn't, it is a young teacher.  From there the action begins.  Billy receives more notes forcing him to choose between two evils.  With each choice Billy makes, his life becomes intertwined with those being murdered.  Billy is a bartender whose has become a hermit since his fiance went into a coma 4 years ago.  However, Billy is hiding some secrets that Koontz hints at early and finally reveals later.  At first, I was frustrated because I thought the secrets would hint at who was the killer.  But Koonts knows what he is doing and reveals everything and due time and the results are captivating.<br /><br />Billy Wiles has lived a sad life, as evidenced by his fiance in a coma, his parents, his relationship with Lanny Olsen and his lack of friends.  Yet in Velocity, Wiles is transformed through tragic circumstances into the man he knew he could become.<br /><br />Velocity has everything.  A devoted love, a determined hero, an evil villian.

After 2 hapless sessions, Lauren quits coming.  She visits him six years later after a chance encounter at a batchelor party, with Lauren as the stripper and Alex as the leering spectator.  Four years after that, Lauren is missing and her concerned mom asks Alex to look into it.  Evidently, Alex made a big impression on her.  And thus begins, Alex and Police Detective Milo Sturgis' investigation into the disappearnce and murder of Lauren Teague.  Lauren was hardly in this novel at all, and Alex's interaction was especially brief.  So the entire novel has to be carried by two quick meetings.  Of course this won't work, so more mysteries are created out of Lauren's murder that at times seem forced and tacked on.<br /><br />I haven't read many Kellerman books, but did recently read Murder Book and this books have a lot similar in plot and structure.  First, Milo is the detective and Alex gets to go along and says nothing while Milo interviews people but listens to everything.  Then Alex does a lot of amateur detective work on his own.  This becomes very tedious in Flesh and Blood, when Alex several times follows suspicious characters.<br /><br />I listened to this on audio so I don't know how many pages this book was, but it was too long.  To much time is spent giving fine details to interviews and descriptions of trivial characters.  All the book really is is interviews.  Alex and Milo or just Alex talking to someone.  This is basically a procedural novel where we follow the cops as they solve the crime.  I won't mention who, but for all the great detective work, this case could have been solved so much sooner because the case breaks when a character they interviewed earlier decides at a later point to include something they had knowingly left out.  To me, this is bad plotting.  The character should have said all they knew.  Instead, the reader is led on a wild goose chase that could have prevented a lot of wasted time and pain if they had just spilled there guts.  Another frustrating tactic used by Kellerman is when the person being question says \\"honestly that's all I know\\" and it almost always turns out they knew more and this always leads Alex and Milo back to interview them again.  Its one big circle.<br /><br />Also, Alex and Milo never really find anything out.  They operate entirely on assumptions and theories that usually turn out to be true mainly to advance the plot.  Despite its faults, Flesh and Blood has an interesting character in Cheryl Duke, and all of the loose ends are tied up nicely.  Don't care much for the relationship with Robin though.<br /><br />Flesh and Blood is an okay book, not bad enough for me to quit reading Kellerman, but still with enough faults to keep me from rushing out to buy his next new release.chase that could have prevented a lot of wasted time and pain if they had just spilled there guts.

The is first time I've read a Christian novel in this genre.  FBI agent Mick Kline's brother was just murdered randomly, and Mick is obsessed with finding the killer.  Mick thinks he has found a link between his brother's murder and seven other cases of cop murders over the last few years.  Mick is forced to go on leave and with the help of some FBI friends including a profiler Mick continues to investigate the case.<br /><br />Mick's search leads him to Faith Kemper.  Faith lost her husband a few years ago to a murderer and has been moving around because of an unknown fear.  In the attack that killed her husband, Faith lost her sight and now must get around with the help of a seeing eye dog.<br /><br />The Splitting Storm focuses mainly Faith and Mick and a few other characters, yet for a serial killer thriller, there are quite a few twists and turns that kept me interested and surprised.  This novel is character driven, not plot driven, but the plot is still strong and interesting.  The characters in this book are Christians and yet they have their troubles and their fights with God.  The religion isn't over the top or preachy and seemed in place in this book.	2005-06-20
US	50320963	R1057IFQ8SNR3K	0451163494	464602444	The Key to Rebecca	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Spy thriller full of sexual tension	The Key to Rebecca is Follett's third novel after he hit it big with the Eye of the Needle, and I enjoyed it a lot even though it lost steam towards the end.  Follett is one of my favorite authors because of the way he can bring historical periods to life with entertaining and vibrant characters.  Often, the same type of character exists in each book but because Follett is so good, his style works.<br /><br />The Key to Rebecca is set in WWII in Egypt, where Rommell is about to conquer the country for the Germans because of the help of Alex Wolff, a German spy.  Wolfe's nemesis is William Vandam, a British officer charged with detecting and stopping all covert spies.  Follett introduces the decident Sonja, a famous Egyptian belly dancer who has a history with Wolff and ends up helping him.  On Vandam's side is Elena, a beautiful you girl who wants to immigrate to Israel and needs help.  She agrees to help Vandam catch Wolff in hopes of Vandam making it easier for her to travel to Israel.<br /><br />Follett takes the ultimate question of who will win the war in Egypt and boils it down to the story of these four people.  Therefore, as he writes about their lives and passions, we know there is much more at stake.  Follett sets up a conflict that boils down to sexual in nature, which makes the ending sort of a let down.  The ending is a standard chase scene that vears away from the conflict established in the middle part of the book.  Without giving it all away, Sonja is a sexual being who can be controlled if her sexual preferences are catered to.  Wolff is Sonja's lover but will betray her at anytime to get his way.  Elena has gone from man to man and now Vandam wants her to seduce Wolff and she is angered at Vandam's attitude toward her because she has fallen for him.<br /><br />This conflict between the characters is the strength of the novel and unfortunately it gets resolved with about 50 pages to go.  Still, I've read 3/4 of Follett's novels, and this one too is a must read.too is a must read. <br />	2005-06-10

Some of the most intriguing chapters include ones on the cause of decreasing crime in the 1990s and how powerful information can be to real estate agents and KKK members.<br /><br />This is a fun quick read but could have been better if it had been longer and had more direction.  The authors admit their book doesn't have a theme, but it would have been nice to tie all of the author's premises together in a unifying theme.<br /><br />Still, this is a fun book that doesn't really teach you anything but does shed light on a few subjects.  For example, to be a good parent it matters who you are, not what you do.  Very few people get rich selling crack cocaine.  Your child's name has little to do with his future success.  And finally, swimming pools are more dangerous than guns to the safety of children and child safety seats really don't help that much.	2005-06-01
US	50320963	R1B5P327MUHIFB	0399152725	547962267	Broken Prey (Lucas Davenport)	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Prey series missing something...still a good book	Broken Prey is John Sandford's latest Lucas Davenport thriller.  While entertaining, Broken Prey doesn't stand up to some of his other works.  I've been trying to read the series in order and read the first six and then Chosen Prey and Naked Prey.  One predominant item missing from Broken Prey is the story written from the view point of the killer.  In all of the Prey novels I've read, Sandford opens or quickly includes in the novel chapters about the killer.  This detail allows the reader to know the cops don't know and to either empathize with the killer (Clara Rinker) or be disgusted by them.<br /><br />Broken Prey opens with some murders that are linked to 3 serial killers imprisoned in a mental hospital.  Davenport and Sloan and many others have to find out how these 3 men are communicating to someone on the outside and getting him to kill for them.  About the killer's point of view, Davenport includes two threads of stories that relate to the killer but it is hard to see how at the time.  To me, this seems like the biggest weakness of the novel, we aren't given insight into the true evil of the killer(s).<br /><br />The language in Broken Prey isn't as vulgar as some of the earlier novels and now that Lucas is married, there isn't any sex either.  Also, I think Stanford implied Lucas in his late 40s.  I think in Rules of Prey, the first Prey book written 15 years ago, Davenport was 42 or so.  I see that Stanford slowed the aging process down to keep Davenport young and able to do all the stuff he does.<br /><br />Broken Prey is a good novel that is missing a key ingredient that has made the Prey series so successful.  Still, this is one of the best series out there and if you haven't read any in the series I recommend you start at the beginning.	2005-05-27
US	50320963	RYHOWDW8U7XBO	0316710601	293191939	4th of July	Books	4	4	6	N	N	A good book	4th of July, the fourth book in the Women's Murder Club, focuses almost completely on Lyndsey Boxer (as they all really do).  After two murder suspects wreck following a high speed chase, Boxer and her partner get into a shootout that lands Boxer in court.  While on leave awaiting trial, she travels to Half Moon Bay to stay in her vacationing sister's house.<br /><br />In Half Moon Bay, Boxer becomes involved in the investigation of several killings that resemble the killings of one of her first cases, a John Doe who died 10 years ago.<br /><br />4th of July is a good book, better than 3rd Degree, because it keeps the plot simple.  Killers are loose and Boxer must find them.  As he usually does, Patterson gives details about some of the killer's actions, giving us clues as to their motives, but not revealing it all until the end.  I couldn't guess who the killers were but their motives were obvious.  Still, 4th of July kept my interest as I followed Boxer's quest to find out who was killing people in the town.<br /><br />This book is more entertaining and more realistic than London Bridges or Honeymoon, Patterson's last 2 books.	2005-05-13

Medved's book chronicals his liberal origins in great detail then moves on to his current role in pop culture as a movie critic and more recently as a conservative talk show host.<br /><br />I glanced at a few of the negative reviews about a week ago and it appeared to me these reviewers never read Right Turns, but instead didn't like Michael Medved for his political views.  I think those negative reviews are ridiculous since they aren't about the book but at the same time I see no reason why someone who doesn't share Medved's beliefs in a strong family and strong religious beliefs should read this book.  Medved is a conservative and he gets to the heart of why he believes 1970s era liberalism was so foolish and wrong.<br /><br />Medved's details of his college and early political life are quite intriguing.  At Yale, Medved met many current politicians including John Kerry, Joseph Leiberman and Bill and Hillary.  His observations of his contemporaries are amusing, Kerry and Bill (negative), Hilary (positive).  Medved goes into great detail about his liberal upbringing, his campaigning for Bobby Kennedy (including being present at his assisination), his leading of protests at Yale, his campaigning for various other politicians and his time spent at Berkley.  While detailing his liberal activism, Medved points out specific moments where doubt began to creep in and he began to realize he might actually be a conservative.<br /><br />The book is structured around Medved's life with policital lessons thrown in for each chapter.  At the end of the book, Medved skips around in his life some in order to cover all the necessary subjects, so the story arc of liberal to conservative is kind of choppy at the end.  Still some of the best chapters are on his divorce and remarriage and on how he became a movie reviewer and got the job on Sneak Previews.  Medved also covers his trek that led him to become a devout orthodox Jew.  I admire his devotion to his religion especially to the extend it led him to be a staunch defender of Christianity in Hollywood.<br /><br />One amusing note about Medved's writing style.  While working in many campaigns early in life, he mentions the contact he had with many perky, sexy women but never goes into detail about any relationships.  (Except for the implied celebration with 2 women that was interrupted by RFK's assasination.)  Then considering Medved's religious beliefs I wondered if he had abstained from all of the free love of the 70s.  Only later in the book when he is writing about how hard it was to concieve a child does he say it was a miracle he didn't have a child during the 70s while working on campaigns.<br /><br />Right Turns is a good book for any conservative to read.

At no point during reading this novel did it really grab my interest and therefore it'll probably be the last book I read by this author.  A good thriller has to catch you from the beginning, and Likely to Die just doesn't do that.  Fairstein's experience as a prosecuter of sex crimes does add some interesting sidebars about sex crimes that are interesting, but irrelevant to the story.<br /><br />The story revolves around a respected neurosurgeon, Gemma Doggen, being brutally murdered.  Alex Cooper takes the case as the District Attorney and joins with the cops as they try and find the killer.  In the first 100 pages or so, there is a lot of interaction between Cooper, and detectives Chapman and Mercer.  They investigate the crime scene and organize the investigation.  What Fairstien leaves out is a reason to care about Gemma Dogen or some reason to fear the killer.<br /><br />The entire story is from Cooper's point of view, so witnesses aren't interviewed until well into the novel and Dogen's background isn't explored until it was too late.  Likely to Die could have been a good novel if it dove right into Dogen's past and why she might have been killed.  As it is, this novel provided little mystery and even less suspense.  It also could have used some editing because there is way to much of Cooper's personal life with names of friends being dropped constantly that have nothing to do with the story.<br /><br />As a second novel, I guess this was pretty good.  I recommend reading Fairstien's latest works and go back to this one if you like them.	2005-04-28
US	50320963	R23AISQS0OZTEZ	0446531855	149889886	Detour: A Novel	Books	2	3	5	N	N	A good book	Detour is James Siegel's follow-up to the thriller Derailed and Detour begins with the same intensity then really fizzles out at the end.  James and Joanna Breibard are travelling to Columbia to adopt a baby girl after failing to conceive on their own.  Soon, everything goes wrong and James and Joanna must fight to save themselves and the life of their baby.  The beginning of the novel is strong.  Siegel's description of the depravity in Columbia is terrifying and convincing.  Then, there are many intriguing questions such as who is the nanny and the driver?  What will happen to the Breibards and their baby?  What happened to the baby?  In the beginning of Detour, the reader is caught up in the action.<br /><br />Then the pace of the novel changes when Paul and Joanna are separated.  Paul's story becomes separate and turns into more of a standard mystery with characters such as his lawyer, a Russian Mobster and a DEA agent all crossing his path.  Are these characters who they seem to be.  When Paul is separated from Joanna, the danger and terror associated with Columbia disappears and so does some of the suspense.<br /><br />Detour concludes with several twists and turns, nothing to surprising are groundbreaking.  This is a quick, entertaining read that fails to distinguish itself from so many other books on the market.	2005-04-19
US	50320963	R2Y9PBZUQ91TUO	0425137562	525066589	Silent Prey	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Sequel to Eyes of Prey is Okay	I've read maybe half of the \\"Prey\\" series by John Sandford and one of its biggest strengths is Sandford's ability to create new, unique plots each time out.  Based on reading other authors, it seems sometimes a series can be difficult to keep fresh and new.  Silent Prey is one of two books that I know of that carry over a villian from one book to the next.<br /><br />Michael Becker is the evil surgeon who Lucas Davenport mutilated but didn't kill at the end of Eyes of Prey.  Becker escapes from prison and moves to New York and begins killing again.  Lucas is called to consult on the case by ex-lover NYC cop Lily Rothenburg.  Lily also wants Lucas to investigate some cops that are killing bad guys one the side.  These guys went overboard and killed Lily's friend who was investigating them.<br /><br />So, Silent Prey is somewhat repetitive with the Becker case but Stanford mixes in the police case equally well.  This is another solid thriller by Sandford with believable police work and sustainable suspense.<br /><br />Like all books in the series, the word \\"Jesus\\" is used more than in the bible and the \\"F-word\\" is used more than 99% of all R-rated movies.  I don't know how realistic this is but it must be what Sandford's world is like.  Still, this is a fun series and this entry doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />One final note; Eyes of Prey ended with a sudden revelation of who Becker's wife's lover was.  In Silent Prey the action ends then Sandford writes 3 more chapters filling the readers in on some of the unanswered questions.  I appreciated that because many authors leave clues then fail to conclude them at the end.	2005-04-19
US	50320963	R1NPK35B376VOO	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	2	6	11	N	N	Agree with the idea, but not a good novel	State of Fear is the new bestselling book by successful author Michael Crighton.  At the same time, it is the first Crighton book I've read and I came away not very impressed.  Knowing how successful Crighton is, I'm not going to be too critical, but State of Fear has some obvious flaws.<br /><br />The novel starts out strong with several unrelated events occuring one after another.  A researcher is seduced then killed, scientific equimpment is bought by a mysterious man, 500 military rockets are bought, and an underwater research submarine is rented.  How do these events tie together?  I wanted to know the answers then the novel begins.  The story revolves around Peter Evans, a lawyer for George Horton.  Horton is financing a lawsuit against the EPA by Nicholas Drake, a staunch enviromentalist.<br /><br />Beyond that, the plot evolves around environmentalists trying to manipulate the environment to draw attention to their cause and Evans and a government agent trying to stop them.  State of Fear reminded me a lot of the DaVinci Code.  In both books, the author goes into long discussion of facts to prove his case.  In State of Fear, Kenner states a fact then goes into a long explantion of why there isn't really global warming or sea levels really aren't rising.  Crighton even includes footnotes.  All of this is very interesting and educational, especially for someone like me who never trusted the claims of the extreme left of the environmental movement.  Yet it doesn't make good reading, especially for someone who doesn't agree with Crichton's point of view.  Even if everything is true that Crighton says (as he wants you to believe by the use of footnotes) I don't think people read novels to be educated or persuated, they read to be entertained.<br /><br />Does State of Fear entertain?  Not really.  Mainly because the characters are so boring.  There is some conflict set up between Peter Evans and Sarah (Norton's assistant) and Jennifer (Kenner' s assistant.)  But nothing really comes of it, none of the characters are given enough time for us to know and for their stories to resolve.  A lot of the motivation of Kenner isn't given, like why he brings along Peter and Sara and Jennifer while trying to stop the attacts.  Also, why isn't more of the government involved in stopping the attacks, like a Special Forces Unit or something.  Finally, as Kenner and his band of amateurs thwart each attack, there is no sense of despair or urgeny on the part of the terrorists.  In fact, we never really see anything from their point of view at all.<br /><br />I really don't know what to make of this novel.  Crighton is a consistent best seller and I agree with the thesis of his novel.  But this is a novel, not an essay, so it should entertain and as a novel I think it fails.But nothing really comes of it, none of the characters are given enough time for us to know and for their stories to resolve.

His newest effort, Honeymoon, exemplifies everything that has gone wrong with the writer's career.  First, he is cranking out 3 to 4 books a year, usually with the help of a co-author.  How can the books be expected to be good when each gets about 3 months of work.  Second, the tagline below the title, \\"\\"2005 International Thriller of the Year.\\"\\"  What a bogus and ridiculous claim that is.  The publishers or author obviously added that line to sell books.  Honeymoon has won no such awards or accolades.<br /><br />Finally, the following quote comes fromt the author's website. \\"You've been asked before, \\"Don't tell anyone the ending.\\" With Honeymoon, don't tell anyone the beginning either.  All writers have a book that they know is their best book, ever. Welcome to James Patterson's HONEYMOON.\\"  Either this is shameless marketing, or Patterson has lost his mind.<br /><br />The plot of Honeymoon is the basic black widow story, the book jacket will tell you that.  Many men who come in contact with the beautiful Nora Sinclair are dying.  That's why FBI agent John O'Hara is investigating her.  That's what the book jacket tells us, O'Hara is FBI.  But the novel pretends this is a mystery, trying to hide O'Hara's identity as well as Susan, his boss, like it is some big mystery.  Another problem is Nora's mother, who is locked away in an insane asylum after killing her husband.  Toward the end of the book, Patterson comes right out and says Nora's mom has a big secret that will reveal why Nora might be the way she is and why Nora's mom actually killed her husband, except Patterson never reveals it.<br /><br />From the website, when Patterson says don't tell anyone the ending, or the beginning, I have to ask, why?  The beginning is nothing special and the ending, is well, rather plain.  The ending is just another twist in the plot, not a surprise twist on the fate or identity of the characters, and therefore, it isn't a surpise at all.<br /><br />I urge Patterson fans to not pay full price for this pulp.  I wish Patterson would reread some of his earlier books like Along Came a Spider or Kiss the Girls so he could rethink the claim that this is his best book ever.  The so-called \\"2005 International Thriller of the Year\\" will be forgotten before summer of 05.  It is not original or unique.  If it wasn't for Patterson's history or his own hype over this rather ordinary book, then I wouldn't be bashing it so much.  As it is, I give it one star.a surpise at all. <br /> <br />I urge Patterson fans to not pay full price for this pulp.

Blood Memory is a return to form for Iles whose Footprints of God novel was his weakest effort.  Blood Memory is a novel with new characters and a deep, intricate plots with a few characters from previous novels to add to the flavor.<br /><br />Blood Memory centers around Cat Ferry, a forensic dentist dating a married detective and aiding him in a serial killer investigation.  After fainting at a 2nd consecutive crime scene, Cat returns to her childhood home.  By accident, her forensic chemicals are spilled in her old room and reveal a bloody footprint.<br /><br />The plot after this is too complicated to reveal in this review.  There are plenty of twists and turns as Cat tries to find the truth about the death of her father.  Basically, everyone Cat knows from her powerful grandfather, her weak-willed mother, and her childhood nanny/servant are all hiding secrets.  The novel slowly builds to some painful moments as some horrifying secrets are revealed.<br /><br />Iles is obviously concerned about the subjects covered in this book. He does a great job of presenting the horrors of child abuse and the wide-reaching effect in can have on so many people.  Perhaps one weakness is Cat Ferry.  We are told she is an achololic, manic depressive and that some of her strangest behaviors come out during sex with many of her married partners.  Perhaps if this had been shown, Cat would have become that more sympathetic as a character.  Sean Reagan, Cat's married partner is sort of shoved to the side as the novel concludes, but Iles has so much to cover that it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone.  It is quite powerful.  With the exception of Footprints of God, I urge everyone to read all of Iles' boooks if you can.  He is one of the greats.	2005-03-17

The plot has an intriguing premise, with three unrelated events tied together.  The opening sizzles with a beautiful woman thrown from a balcony in Hong Kong.  The chapters also set up the plot quickly, with wife of CIA operations chief Carrie McNeil being interviewed after her husband Drum has disappeared.<br /><br />This novel runs at 370 pages yet the action could have been boiled down to about 100.  Nothing really happens.  Smith does a good job establishing the few characters there are in this novel, perhaps too good.  Many pages ramble on and on about day to day activities of Carrie and her son Jonah and their life.  Sure, the ending has some action and few \\"twists\\".  But absolutely nothing happens before that.  This book has a beginning and an end but no middle. I recommend this book to no one.	2005-03-02

In this edition, Lucas is still torn up by the ending of Shadow Prey which featured an attack in his home against himself, his lover and his child.  He takes it out on a young thug by beating him senseless.  Internal Affairs begins to investigate and Lucas is on a short leash as he begins to investigate the murder of Stephanie Becker.<br /><br />As it is with many Prey books, we know who the killer is.  Except in this case, there are two killers.  Two evil men decided to try and idea they gleaned from a movie where they each take turns killing each other's problem person.  Carlo Druze kills Becker's wife and Becker kills Druze's boss.  There are problems however when their is a witness to Becker's wife's murder, an unknown lover.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there are more killings.  Becker is a pathologist at the university hospital and is constantly living in a drug induced stupor or euphoria.  Druze is a scarred, damaged man easily pliable by Becker.  The strength in Eyes of Prey lie in the tight police work and the characterization of the bad guys and of Lucas's decent into depression.  The ending is also surprising, yet doesn't really give any clues into the forth book in the series (which retains some characters from this book).<br /><br />As usual in the series, there is a lot of cussing and sleeping around.  But Standford has crafted another great thriller that will keep me reading the entire series.	2005-02-22

I skipped Balance of Power and Protect and Defend, because I didn't deem it worth my time to hear what I felt would be an intelligent assault on my beliefs on abortion and gun control.<br /><br />Patterson is one of the best authors around as his thriller/crime dramas prove, so even though he is tackling politics now, the novels are still going to be well-written.  The problem is that Patterson is immediately going to alienate at least half of the country if he isn't careful.  It is okay to spout liberal beliefs but Patterson must be careful not to insult conservatives if he wants to retain those fans.<br /><br />Patterson succeeds only partly.  Conviction is a story of Rennell Price, a man sentenced to die in a few months before the Paget family takes the case.  They go through all the legal hoops required by law in order to save Price.  In the process, they discover a lot of things about Price.  He may be retarded or he may be innocent.  But will that be enough to set him free?<br /><br />Occassionally, Patterson acknowledges that the pro death penalty crowd has valid beliefs but too often you get the feeling that he has a disdain for conservatives and doesn't respect their opinions.  Conviction does however do a good job of describing intelligently why people are against the death penalty.  Whether it is deliberate or not, conservatives in Conviction all have ulterior motives or are extreme charicatures of real live people like Justices Scalia or Thomas.<br /><br />For me, Conviction gets too technical while arguing the ins and outs of death penalty law.  The scenes at the Supreme Court are somewhat interesting as we get a flavor of how opinions are rendered.  Conviction, however, fails to stand out in the way previous Patterson novels did.  Most of the characters are from previous novels, thus little background info is needed or given on the Pagets.  Writing background has been one of Patterson's strengths, but here it is only relevant with Rennell Price and doesn't add much to the story.<br /><br />In the afterward of the novel, Patterson thanks his publishers for believing there is room for novels that tackle social issues in today's market.  Unfortunately, the social issue becomes the constant theme of the novel and overshadows all characters and plot.  This book might as well be called \\"Death Penalty\\", because that is all that it is about.  Patterson made some good points in the novel and while I'm 100% for killing murderers, I certainly would never want an innocent man to be executed.  Conviction raises the possibility that this can and does happen.  If that's the case then I might agree that changes should be made.at interesting as we get a flavor of how opinions are rendered.

I didn't want to because I knew the bad guy in this book, bad girl assassin \\"Clara Rinker\\" was also in a previous novel.<br /><br />The novel opens in the traditional Prey method of desribing the nemisis first.  Rinker is in a hospital bed after a failed attempt on her life that took the life of her fiance and unborn child.  We quickly discover who tried to kill Rinker and follow her trip back to the USA where she vows vegance on the Mafia guys who tried to kill her.<br /><br />Not knowing about Rinker from the earlier novel, I immediately have sympathy for her.  Sandford follows her efforts with precise detail and covers her background of abuse and neglect just enough for me to be happy when she succeeds in her revenge plots.<br /><br />Lucas Davenport joins the FBI and together they are always one step ahead of Rinker.  It is frustrating in cases like this that the cops must fail to keep the story moving, but Stanford does a good job of keeping the investigation moving.<br /><br />Clara Rinker is a sympathetic person until she starts taking out cops, FBI agents and innocent bystanders.  Finally, she is the bad guy that we want to see die.  Davenport, after many failures, is a worthy adversary of Rinker and the novel comes to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />I'm interested in reading the previous Rinker novel to see what kind of character she is.  As usual, Standford has written another good novel.	2005-02-04
US	50320963	R15L99O1N0WAPU	0385510454	797048445	The Broker: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Fun to read, but nothing special	John Grisham has slowly drifted over the years from the top notch thriller such as Pelican Brief, Runaway Jury and Rainmaker to this type of novel.  The Broker has interesting characters and Grisham tells a good story, but in the end you realize the book and the characters are easily forgotten.<br /><br />Joel Bachman is a ruthless man who earned a lot of money and could play hardball in Washington like no other yet his family mostly hated him and he had no true friends.  In the Broker, we never meet the ruthless Bachman.  We meet him when he is pardoned by a comically inept outgoing president at the urging of the CIA.  The CIA wants to release the \\"broker\\" and then see who kills him to help them get to the bottom of a spy satellite mystery.<br /><br />Grisham details Bachman's extended stay in Italy while tutors try to teach him the language and Bachman, now called Marco, tries to learn the language and figure out what was happening to him.  The story isn't as boring as some other reviewers say.  Along with Marco in Italy, Grisham keeps the story moving with the CIA working to follow Marco, other spies preparing to kill him, and presidential pardon scandals erupting in the US.<br /><br />The Broker seems mightily similar to the \\"Partner\\" and to some extent the King of Torts.  As a main character, whe only glimpse one side of Bachman although he does get some redemption at the end and tries to do right for a change.  Also, I've noticed that for being such a good writer, Grisham never really includes a romantic angle in his novels.  That's unfortunate because I think that is a key missing ingrediant in his later novels that are primarily character driven instead of plot driven.	2005-01-31
US	50320963	R1WAEC3YP4OUYR	0425126064	355969221	Shadow Prey	Books	4	4	10	N	N	The flaws in the series start to show	I read 3 books in this series before I decided to start from the beginning.  As with Rules of Prey, Shadow Prey is fun to read.  Sandford leads Lucas and friends on a believable pursuit of the killers.  Nothing comes easy as Lucas tries to get to the bottom of a group of Indians who are killing people who have harmed Indians in the past.<br /><br />After reading five or six novels in the series, I decided to voice my complaints in this review.  I still plan on reading the entire series, but some things have got on my nerves.  First, Sandford reveals Lucas' age to be 41 (probably real close to Sandford's age at the time.)  Forty one is fine, but in current novels that makes Lucas in his late 50s.  If this series is going to continue, Lucas needs to stay young.<br /><br />I've accepted the fact that Lucas has a foul mouth, dropping constant f-bombs.  But does every single cop, or person for that matter talk that way.  In Sandford's books, every single character, except for the nun, cusses like a sailor.  And Lucas and Jennifer even cussed around their baby.  Obviously everyone doesn't talk like this, and even people who cuss all the time don't want their kids to talk that way.<br /><br />Third, Lucas says he just \\"loves women\\" and therefore can't keep his hands off them.  He can't resist cheating on the mother of his child with a married woman NYC cop Lily Rothenberg and then going right back to the mother of his child and sleeping with her.  Lily shows some guilt in having an affair yet goes out of her way to cheat on her husband.  What a woman!  Actually, all of this womanizing by Lucas doesn't bother me too much, except for the fact that we don't know why he does it.  Why does this 41 year old man still think he's a 25 year old batchelor sleeping with every woman he can?<br /><br />Finally, all the cops seem the same and run together.  They all talk alike and do the same things, and there isn't any characterization to set them apart.<br /><br />On this book specific, Sandford draws from his knowledge of Indian culture to write some Indians as bad guys.  Probably the weakest bad guys of the series so far.  Yet their final motive is just, and none of the cops actually mention that the Indians' ultimate goal was more than just terror.<br /><br />I recommend this book and the entire series.  But be prepared for a lot of bad language and loose morals.ok specific, Sandford draws from his knowledge of Indian culture to write some Indians as bad guys.

I've read three books in the series, some older, some newer, and the thing that impressed me the most about Rules of Prey was its style. It doesn't read like a first novel.  It reads like it could have been written last year.  Sandford's talent is evident from the beginning.<br /><br />Rules of Prey begins with the story being told from the killer's point of view first.  Right away, we learn about the sick \\"maddog\\" intent on killing women.  He has studied murders and from his studies knows how to not get caught.  He even leaves clues with each of his victim, printouts saying \\"rules\\" of killing like \\"never have a motive\\" or \\"never kill anyone you know.\\"  One drawback to the story is that these clues are trademark of the killer, yet they really have nothing to do with the case being solved.<br /><br />This book also introduces Lucas Davenport, full time cop and part time fantasy game writer.  We get to meet a few of the many loves of his life including the reporter who will have his child.  Lucas is a womanizer and a rough cop.  Sandford gives the details of Lucas being a sometimes over the top cop and details of his childhood friend the nun (I forget her name).  Yet Sandford never details why Lucas goes from woman to woman (even while one is carrying his child) or why Lucas is so willing to break the police rules to achieve justice.  What happened to Lucas to give him these characteristics.  Maybe its covered in other novels.<br /><br />Even though I complain about the above, it doesn't take away from the greatness of the novel. As in his other novels, the police work and the slow methodical way in which the truth is discovered is realistic and interesting.  Nothing comes easy as Lucas tries to stop the maddog before he kills one last time.<br /><br />I've read a few of the series, not in order, but now I plan on reading from beginning to end.  I recommend you do the same if you are interested in the police genre and enjoy the gritty realism of John Sandford.the same if you are interested in the police genre and enjoy the gritty realism of John Sandford.	2005-01-13

But the premise to Life Expectancy sounded really interesting.  Before he is even born, Jimmy Tock's grandfather predicts 5 exact days that will bring horrible suffering to Jimmy and his family.  Jimmy's birth is even chaotic because while he is being born, another expectant father who happens to be a circus clown goes on a rampage.<br /><br />Koontz writes in first person from the point of view of Jimmy Tock.  Jimmy is a good story teller yet we never learn much about him or his wife or really any of the characters of the story.  Still, what drives the novel is the 5 days looming in the future and rather or not Jimmy will survive them.  The first day is the most exciting and detailed as Jimmy decides the local library would be a good place to go.  Once there, a man shoots the librarian and takes Jimmy and a girl named Lorrie hostage.<br /><br />The lives of Jimmy, his family are intertwined with that of the homicidal circus clown at the beginning of the book up to the last of the 5 horrible days.  While I enjoyed reading this book and it is a fast read, it really lacked the substance to make it special.	2005-01-03
US	50320963	R18HPKL5U6MQ3G	0525948430	518961183	Whiteout	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Another great book by Follet, but not a classic	Almost all of Follett's best novels have been epic in scope, from Pillars of the Earth to Hornet Flight to the Man from St. Petersberg to Dangerous Fortune.  They usually span weeks, months, decades or even centuries.  In Whiteout, Follett chooses to depict a story in a closed setting over a couple of days (like Night over Water).<br /><br />Whiteout revolves around the Oxenburg family gathering to celebrate Christmas.  The family is your typical family with the widowed grandfather Stanley, the feuding siblings and the horny teenagers.  Basically Whiteout contains typical Follett characters.  Although, one thug, Daisy, stands out as a unique character.<br /><br />Stanley's son Kit is involved to steal a deadly virus from Oxenburg medical and the chief security officer Toni Gallo is there to try and stop him.  Much of the latter half of the story occurs in the Oxenburg's home, which leads to a lot of cat and mouse type action.<br /><br />Follett is a good writer, even his most serious moments are amusing in a good way.  An example in this book is Caroline, the granddaughter of Stanley.  Follett never comes out and states what her condition is, but instead, he writes her in the way the others in the family know her or the way Toni Gallo would think of her since they have only just met.  In other words, Follett shows us that Caroline might not be mentally all there, but doesn't come out and make it an obvious point.  This is because to the family it isn't a big deal since she is already accepted.<br /><br />The above example about Caroline has nothing to do with the story but is an example of while Follett is a good author.<br /><br />I enjoyed Whiteout and recommend it to all Follett fans.  Unfortunately it doesn't rate as one of his bests because the scope of the novel is so short it doesn't allow his characters to grow on you and form an impression in your mind.  Still, this is a fun, quick read that I recommend.	2004-12-17
US	50320963	R3GA0M0834VOJY	0310217571	4734243	Private Justice (Newpointe 911, Book 1)	Books	2	22	30	N	N	I wanted to like this book.	I really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great.  A shocking murder is committed in the town of Newpointe, then another.  Meanwhile, fireman Mark Branning has moved out and is separated from his wife Allie.  There is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and Allie and Mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage.  I wanted to like this book because it is a Christian novel with a good purpose.  Ninety percent of the books I've read have been secular but I'm starting to read more Christian novels.  But to me, this book fails for three reasons:  the marriage conflict between Mark and Allie isn't believable, the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight, and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing.<br /><br />Mark and Allie's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn't convinced her otherwise.  Seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery, but it is grounds for suspicion.  Yet, Allie assumes Mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman.  It seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight.  Instead, Mark and Allie separate and Allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair.<br /><br />Blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between Mark and Allie.  Throughout the book, references are made to Allie believing Mark had an affair with Issie.  Allie refers to Mark's act as \\"adultery\\" and recalls him \\"lying\\" his way out of it after Allie caught him hugging Issie.  Their marriage is struggling, but Blackstock should have given more reasons why Allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book, Mark says he didn't have an affair and Allie chalks it up to one of his lies.<br /><br />Later in the novel, Blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late.<br /><br />The serial killer story is poorly done, and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book.  When they book a suspect at the end, it seems ridiculous.  The police work feels like it was written by an amateur.  One line in the novel, \\"As much as the evidence pointed to XXX, Stan didn't want to believe it.\\"  In my opinion, the evidence didn't point to that person and Stan, the detective, seems foolish for believing it.  There isn't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story.  There is no sense of setting in the book.  There are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other.<br /><br />Finally, this book talks about God and prayer and being \\"saved\\" throughout the book, and that's great.  With a serial killer on the loose, a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way.<br /><br />At one point, a conversation goes like this:  \\"How can the murder be part of God's plan?\\"  \\"Maybe it isn't\\"  \\"That would mean God isn't in control.\\"  \\"He is in control, but he allows some things to happen.\\"<br /><br />Then at another point, Mark says to Allie, \\"I'm going to be fine, it's time to trust the Lord.  He's taken care of us so far.\\"<br /><br />Then Allie says:  \\"But I don't know what his plan is.  I don't know how he wants this to end.  I don't know what he wants to teach us.\\"<br /><br />At other points in the book, characters say that God has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of God's plan and that through God's plan, all things can be used for good.  This line of logic is infuriating.  Bad things happen to everyone, including God's people.  God doesn't \\"allow\\" a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife.  That's a horrible message to send to a non-Christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck.  Telling them it was part of God's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from God.<br /><br />God is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and God can evenkeep bad things from happening to Christians.  But like above, where Allie was afraid because she thought God might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson, God doesn't willfully kill people.  It comes down to the simple fact that all people, including serial killers and Christians, have choices to make and have free will.<br /><br />I'm surprised I wrote so much on an 8 year old book but I wanted it to be a good book.e was afraid because she thought God might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson, God doesn't willfully kill people.

US	50320963	R1JZJDFN0OIZIH	0316710598	224255669	London Bridges (Alex Cross Novel)	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Standard Alex Cross Novel, fast paced and no depth	Alex Cross is back, and this time he's facing down two bad guys from two previous books, the Weasel and the Wolf.  The plot is intriguing.  The Wolf destroys entire small towns in the US, England and France to prove he has the power to destroy larger cities.  Then the Wolf holds the entire world hostage as he demands money or he will blow up cities across the world.  Working for the FBI, Cross is on the case and travels to various cities teaming up with English and French police to try and find the Wolf.  Cross doesn't really do much investigating but is there for all the key discoveries.  The novel is fast paced and easy to read but lacks the depth (as do all Patterson novels) to make it truly enjoyable.<br /><br />There are so many faults with Patterson books that it is easy to criticize.  For starters, has there ever been a Cross book where the bad guy didn't have it in for Cross?  Maybe in some of the early ones, but recently it seems all of the bad guys exist just to torment Cross.  Also, there was no point for the Weasel to be in this book.  He serves no purpose.  In order to add depth to the story, Patterson could have written in flashback mode what exactly made the Wolf so evil.  This event is referenced throughout the novel and then explained in a few lines at the end.  Also, characters come and go so fast there is no point in caring about them.  Maybe this is realistic since the story is coming from Cross's point of view, but it leaves out a lot of details.  Finally, the finale of the book includes several twists and turns, none of which are given adequae explanation.<br /><br />On the good side, I enjoyed the incorporation of the present day concern for terrorism.  As far fetched as the Weasel and Wolf may be, it made the novel more realistic to include the Department of Homeland Security and references to Osama bin Laden and 9/11.<br /><br />Patterson's problem in my opinion is the scope of the novels.  It would be nice to get back to the roots of the series where Alex is trying to stop a killer. There are no agendas against Cross or national implications, just the cops trying to catch a bad guy.  Patterson could easily write a great novel revolving around that plot.  A good place to start would be to write a novel about finding the man who killed his wife, which Patterson mentions in this book as being unsolved.<br /><br />London Bridges is typical James Patterson fare.  It is fast-paced and enjoyable yet nothing substantial.  Despite the above complaints, I still enjoyed this book and look forward to his next work.the series where Alex is trying to stop a killer.

The conflict in this novel revolves around the struggling marriage of Jonathan and Kathy Harper.  This type of conflict is rarely dealt with in novels (especially secular thrillers).  Conflict in a marriage and possible affairs are a great subject matter because everybody can relate to marriage in one way or another.<br /><br />Jonathan Harper is a fiction editor at a publishing house who devotes all his time to his work and is slowly drifting away from his family.  The main cause of the drift is Sydney Kasdan, a beautiful co-worker.  Jonathan is entranced by her and their are many times where if she offered, he would have had an affair instantly.  One critic on Amazon complained that Jonathan's lust wasn't a sin since he never had an affair, but I disagree.  Jonathan was at a point in his marriage where he was deliberately distant from Kathy and wanted to sleep with Sydney.  (Perhaps, if they had shared a kiss in the course of their flirtation, the \\"sin\\" would have been more real).<br /><br />Anyway, about that time, Jonathan begins receiving a story that is eerily similar to his own life, and it contains details no one else could possibly know.  The story causes Jonathan to confront details in his life.  The story covers his childhood all the way to his current marriage problems.  At the same time Jonathan is reading another story about a serial killer written by his best friend and father figure Clyde.<br /><br />The strongest part of the book was Jonathan's temptation to stray from his wife and sleep with Sydney and once that was resolved, the book seemed to go slow at times.  Still, the book was interesting as Jonathan tries to find out who was sending him the story of his life and he tries to find out the meaning of Clyde's serial killer story.<br /><br />The spiritual aspects of this novel are front and center, the full gospel is on display.  I've read too few Christian novels to know the norm on this.<br /><br />This was a good book touching on the subject of faith and family and how delicate a marriage can be.This was a good book touching on the subject of faith and family and how delicate a marriage can be.	2004-11-15

There is one scene with the \\"yellow-haired girl\\" that goes into the evil of the child porn then this subject isn't really discussed much anymore.  The Iceman is obviously evil because of the murders he committs, but more could have been written about the evil grip he had over the kids who seemed to worship him.<br /><br />This novel was a traditional police mystery with Davenport tracking down clues before finally finding out who the killer is.  This novel introduces Weather, Lucas's love interest for many more novels.<br /><br />Winter Prey is another exciting entry in the series.  Sandford is a good author who follows a similar formula for all his novels yet they still seem fresh and exciting.	2004-11-10

The Murder Book is one in a long series featuring Alex Delaware, and only the second I've read, and most likely the last.  Kellerman does a good job characterizing Alex and gay friend Milo, but the plot is so full of contrivances and holes that it made this book very dissapointing.<br /><br />The book opens with Alex receiving a book with pictures of crime scenes in it dating 20 to 40 years old.  Alex calls Milo over to look at it and Milo instantly recognizes one of the pictures in there.  It is of Janie Ingalls, a case he never solved.  Milo then recalls the case and the investigation with his partner Schwinn in flashback style.  Milo and Schwinn are pulled off the case just as they gather some clues and Milo has been bothered by it ever since.<br /><br />Schwinn has a source who says the Ingalls girl may have been at a party thrown by a bunch of rich kids.  In the present day, Milo and Alex begin investingating the rich kids the Cossacks and their friends Michael Larner and Vance Coury.  It seems like for 200 pages they investigate the rich kids befor the dead Ingalls girl is mentioned again.<br /><br />The link between the murder of the Ingalls girl and then the long drawn out investigation of the Cossacks and Larners and everything that stems from that is tenious at best.  The book kind of glances over this part at the beginning, indicating Schwinn had a source who said there was a wild party at a house owned by the Cossacks.  Alex and Milo believe Ingalls and her friend may have attended the party but have no proof or real reason to believe this.  My problem is that every step that Alex and Milo take in their investigation is circumstancial, not confirmed by any hard facts.<br /><br />Milo and Alex do a lot of investigating, but none of their suspicions are ever confirmed by hard evidence.  The trail of crime from the Cossacks is so drawn out its hard to remember at times what the original investigation was.  Also, there is never really any contact with the bad guys at all in the book.  Then, the book ends with the horrible method of long explanation.  Milo talks with a man who basically explains everything to him about what really happened.  Milo knew some of it through his tedious investigations, but the rest is confirmed in the end.<br /><br />I haven't read much of this series, so I don't know much about the Bert Harrison character.

US	50320963	R1V5KMPVCQU6OI	0849943728	822018095	Three	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An impressive Christian novel!	Besides the poorly written \\"Left Behind\\" series, this is the first Christian book I've read.  I enjoyed Three by Ted Dekker very much.<br /><br />Kevin Parson is a third year seminary student when he gets a phone call telling him to confess his \\"sin\\" or his car will be blown up.  Kevin has no idea what the sin is so he abandons his car in a Wal Mart parking lot where it is blown to bits.  The police are quickly on the case and believe this is the work of \\"the Riddle Killer\\", a murderer who killed after leaving riddles for the victims to solve.  Kevin receives another call telling him to confess a sin or another bomb will explode.  Kevin this time confesses the only sin he can think of but it isn't what the killer is looking for, and a bus is blown away.<br /><br />Kevin is totally confused about his situation and starting to fall apart.  Thankfully his childhood friend Samantha and current California Bureau of Investigation agent comes to help.  Kevin also becomes friends with FBI agent Jennifer Barnes.  From there, the chase is on to find the madman, whose name is Slater, who continues to threaten harm to others until Kevin confesses his sin.<br /><br />Kevin led a deeply troubled childhood and Kevin himself doesn't want to face all the secrets he hides.  Hopefully Kevin can find out what the killer wants him to confess before it is too late.<br /><br />The Christian message of this book is good vs. evil and what must be done to expose evil, even the evil in the most moral people.  The religion is pounded into you but is there just enough to get the message home.  In fact, I think Kevin did not turn to God enough to aid him in his struggle.  Comparing the writing to other novels I've read, Three didn't seem to be as tightly plotted as it could have been.  Samantha's duty with the CBI is never thoroughly covered.  Also, referring to Sam and the FBI agent Jennifer constantly only by their first names took some of the authority out of their positions and made the novel seem \\"soft\\" at times.<br /><br />Still, the conclusion is somewhat surprising in spite of some of hints given earlier in the book.  The conclusion also solves some of the weaknesses of the characters I mentioned above.<br /><br />After reading the book, you'll obviously wonder if what you read earlier in the book is consistent with the \\"truth\\" revealed in the climax.  I haven't yet gone back to reread some of the passages for clues, but it would be a fun excercise.<br /><br />This is an exciting thriller that compares favorably to anything on the secular market and has definitely piqued my interest in Christian novels.e the novel seem \\"soft\\" at times. <br /> <br />Still, the conclusion is somewhat surprising in spite of some of hints given earlier in the book.

Yet it also has a few plot holes and structural flaws.  I listened to the book on audio tape and at times wonder if I missed a side of tape.<br /><br />The story opens with the gruesome murder of Jane Warr and Dion Cash.  They are kidnapped and drug out into the middle of nowhere and hung.  Their naked bodies are found and Lucas Davenport and Del are called in to find out what happened in order to avoid a racial incendent (Jane was white and Dion was black)<br /><br />Sandford then gives the details of the small town where Cash and Warr lived, and where they worked, Kalb's body shop.  Early on, we get the details of Kalb running an illegal operation of stealing old Toyotas and selling them as new in Canada.  Also, a group of Catholic nuns are running a drug operation by driving Kalb's cars to and from Canada.<br /><br />Davenport and Del befriend a little girl named Lettie West who becomes a key part of the story.  The investigation quickly finds the identity of the killer, a man named Hale Sorrell.  Sorrell's daughter was kidnapped a few months ago and apparently Sorrel discovered who did it and then killed them.  So, Lucas assumes Cash and Warr were the kidnappers.  But then another murder happens and Davenport and Dell return to the small town and discover many new crimes.<br /><br />Sandford also tells the story from the true kidnappers.  The brief scenes where Sandford describes how the kidnapped girls were killed are chilling.  Yet not enough time is spent on the kidnappings and how and why those occurred.<br /><br />I saw a few other problems with the story.  Kalb is established as a criminal early on and the entire small town seems to revolve around his auto body business.  Yet Lucas and Del never really look into the activities there beyond a few cursury interviews.<br /><br />The biggest problem I saw was when a main character was shot and seriously wounded.  Lucas and Del easily surmised that the killer was trying to silence her.  Yet Lucas and Del allow this character to return to the small town without any type of protection, leaving her vulnerable to get attacked again.<br /><br />This is only my second Sandford book.  My favorite part has to be the investigations by Del and Lucas.  They seem to discover the evidence in real time.  Nothing is sped up for the sake of the plot (although there are many other story sacrifices made for the sake of the plot.)  In this book, the evil and the crime keep coming, and there are several twists, including one surprising one about the nuns.ously wounded.

US	50320963	RZ4O1616TFYLS	0345458931	730478278	Body Double	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Too short, lacking in detail to be a great thriller	This is my first Gerrittsen novel and I found it enjoyable yet missing a lot of detail and depth that would have made it great.  I'd classify it in the serial killer thriller lite category.  Even if a lot of the characters were from previous novels, I still felt cheated on a lot of the details.<br /><br />  The novel starts off poorly, with the first 70 pages or so devoted to stating the obvious.  Imagine the scenario where you come home and see police surrounding your house.  You get out of the taxi and your neighbors stare at you like you are a ghost.  They do this because there has been a murder and word is you were the one killed.  You run into close friends at the house and they too are shocked to see you because they thought you were dead.  Then they show you the body and you are stunned to see your identical twin looking back at you.  Except you don't have a twin, you are adopted.  Then police look in the wallet and tell you the deceased was the same age as you.  Any smart person would assume that you have a twin that you didn't know about because you were adopted.<br /><br />This situation happens to coroner Maura Iles in Body Double and it takes here 70 pages to even mention that the dead woman might be her twin.  From there, Maura and Det. Rizolli investigate Annie's past, the twin, to find out who killed her and also the truth about Maura's real family.<br /><br />The serial killers in this novel are straight out of a James Patterson novel.  They are incredible evil.  Yet not much detail is given about their methods.  More detail would have added to the creepiness of the story.  Maura flirts briefly with romance with a priest Father Brophy, but Brophy is dropped as a character as soon as Rick Ballard enters the scene.  Ballard was trying to protect Annie from a stalker and even loved her.  Now Maura is falling for him.<br /><br />The ending throws in a nice surprise twist that throws new light on all you read before, yet doesn't take away from the novel.  I enjoyed this book, despite the shortness and lack of detail.el.  I enjoyed this book, despite the shortness and lack of detail.	2004-10-01
US	50320963	R3JCES15S1VPIR	0804115486	335815295	Enigma	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A surprising literary novel	Enigma is a surprising WWII spy novel that I enjoyed a lot, much more than Harris's Fatherland or Archangel.  Enigma is a code used by Germany that they believe is unbreakable.  Except the allies have broke it and are using to aid their war plans.<br /><br />One day, the Germans change their code books and Thomas Jericho, the expert who broke Enigma the first time, is called back to work after having a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />From there, the story follows Thomas and his codebreakers as they try and find the key to breaking Enigma and preventing the German u-boats from sinking Allied convoys coming across the Atlantic.  Thomas is sidetracked in his pursuit by the mysterious Claire Romilly, a fellow codebreaker who he had an affair with and fell in love with and who subsequently dumped him.  Claire has disappeared and Thomas joins her roommate Hester to try and find Claire and find the truth behind her mysterious actions.<br /><br />This is a spy novel, not really an action story, so the story revolves around the characters and their feelings and relationships.<br /><br />I have several comments about this book.  Rarely do I find I enjoy a novel so much after not being too impressed by an author's previous works.  But Enigma is far different and better than Fatherland or Archangel, and makes me definitely want to read Pompeii.  Much of the story revolves around Claire Romilly, who never actually appears in the story except for a few brief flashbacks.  Is she a spy, a traitor, dead or alive or missing.  So many questions are thrown at you about this mysterious woman who captivated everyone he came in touch with.<br /><br />This is a WWII novel based on actual events, but unlike others I've read, it keeps you reading to the very end because of the twists and turns.  I was very satisfied at every turning point the novel took and Harris does a great job detailing the hows and whys of the mystery.<br /><br />A quote on the cover says this novel is \\"literate\\" meaning I guess it is more than just an action thriller.

The book revolves around the death of Benjaman Stern, a jewish professor investigating the Catholic church's reaction to the Nazis and the Holecaust.<br /><br />Gabriel Allon is the art restorer/Mossad agent who begins the investigation and slowly picks up clues along the way.  He avoids assasins, has shootouts with Italian police and slowly makes his way to the truth about the Catholic Church.<br /><br />At times, the characters seem remote and distant and therefore the novel is hard to get into.<br /><br />The novel does delve somewhat into the inner workings of the Catholic Church.  This subject was covered much better in Dan Brown's popular \\"Angels and Demons.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"The Unlikely Spy\\" immensely but was only moderately impressed with this book.	2004-09-20

Still, the book was a real page turner and fun to read.<br /><br />The action revolves around terrorists overtaking the White House and then making demands upon the American people while the President hides for safety in his bunker below the White House.  Written in 1999 before 9/11, the plot seems to be more of a fantasy that it does now, and that's how you have to read it.  I don't want to read a fictional account of something horrible that happened, like 9-11, and Transfer of Power would fail if it seemed to close to reality.  It's scary to think that what the terrorists did was even possible, and I don' think in real life it would be.  So, accepting the terrorists could capture the White House allows this to be a good novel.<br /><br />CIA man Mitch Rapp is inserted into the White House to find out as much as he can.  Meanwhile, the army, the politicians and the secret agents do battle over what is the right course of action.  Flynn obviously takes a conservative angle to the story, portraying the vice-president and attorney general just like the stereotypes that many conservatives think of them as.  Vice President Baxter is weak and poll driven and beholden to the United Nations and afraid to use military force.  Given the similar situation in real life, I doubt liberal politicians would act as weak as the characters in this book.  As a conservative, this portrayal doesn't bother me, especially since it is so obvious.<br /><br />The characters in the novel are plentiful and all are cardboard cutouts of military men and politicians.  None of them have any type of depth, except for maybe Anna Reilly.  She is the new national NBC Whitehouse correspondent.  Her character shows some potential to be interesting, but in the end, she serves the purpose of fulfilling every man's fantasy of being a hero.<br /><br />I don't think Flynn does a good job of grasping the national outrage if a scenario like this were to take place in real life.  In one scene, the terrorist Aziz tunes into the NBC nightly news to see what Brokaw has to say.  In real life, the news would be on 24 hours a day covering this catastrophe.<br /><br />Still, this book serves its purpose as a exciting military thriller where the bad guys get what they deserve.  Yet there is nothing that stands out to make it memoriable, except the fact that it contains so many dated references in the war on terror.  But it isn't insensitive and so I reccommend it to lovers of this genre.n does a good job of grasping the national outrage if a scenario like this were to take place in real life.

James Qatar is killer, a man who likes to seduce women then strangle them.  Qatar has other perversions, such as photographing women from afar and turning those photos into pornographic drawings and mailing them to the women anonomously.<br /><br />Qatar's latest potential victim is Ellen Barstad.  Qatar seduces her and lays the groundwork for another killing when Barstad surprises him by being a willing sexual partner.  Thus their relationship continues.<br /><br />Lucas Davenport and his band of police officer friends enter the scene later, investigating a cold case where the body was finally found.  Finding the body causes the police to look closer at the case.  Several clues allow Davenport to proceed in the case.  The dead woman found had a pornographic drawing of herself in her apartment.  Then several other women come forward who have drawings but have no idea where they came from.  Then a police chief from Wisconsin comes forward and reveals they may be dealing with a serial killer because his neice may have met the same fate.<br /><br />Chosen Prey's strength is the police investigation.  They work hard for their info and at times seem to be getting nowhere.  Still they slowly make progress and get closer and closer to Qatar.  Sandford doesn't make it seem easy like some other authors tend to do.<br /><br />One complaint I have is, after all of the thorough police investigations, the way in which Qatar's identity is found has nothing to do with police work.  Qatar is a quality villian who seems to have covered all his tracks, yet through some convenient finds and plausible twists, justice is done.<br /><br />This series is one I plan to continue to read because besides telling a great story, Sandford doesn't let the personal lives of the characters interfere with the book.  Its easy to pick up and follow the lives of Lucas and his fiance Weather.br />	2004-08-30
US	50320963	R3U7ZCBEY7E05V	068805840X	815626329	Paper Money	Books	2	25	26	N	N	Early Follett novel	Follett writes an introduction to this book and explains that in this early novel the plot was too complex and their were too many characters that didn't get enough development.  So Follett admits, this isn't the best book, but it was still entertaining, even if the end was abrupt.<br /><br />The plot revolves around an British politician who is seduced by a young woman then blackmailed into revealing who wins a government oil contract.  Also, financial wizard Felix Laski tells a henchman Tony Cox the location of a delivery of money to be destroyed.<br /><br />The plot then follows the money being stolen and Laski wheeling and dealing to buy the company that won the oil contract.  All of this information is filtered through a newspaper office where the reporters must decide what to print and what not to print.  The only intrigue lies in will the reporters discover the scheme and will they print it, and will some of the bad guys get there due.  For an early novel, this isn't bad, but is extremely obvious that Follett improved greatly after this book.<br /><br />Paper money is short and good read for a Follett fan, but not anyone else.	2004-08-26
US	50320963	R3IDP2GFCHPPU	B0000AHRB0	583024749	Jackdaws	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A great WWII spy novel	Jackdaws is another great book by Follett.  The D-Day invasion is looming and the Allies are trying to cripple the Germans in anyway possible.  The hope to cripple a telephone exchange located in France and enlist the aid of the French Resistance to do so.  With time running out and other efforts failing, the Allies turn to Flick Clairet to lead an all women team into Germany to disable the telephone exchange, thus crippling the German communications right before the invasion.<br /><br />Dieter Frank is a German officer working under the authority of Rommell and trying to stop the resistance.  Frank is a smart man who catches many members of the resistance but always seems to be one step behind.  Frank is a somewhat sympathetic character who views duty as the ultimate call, and is great at torturing prisoners, even though he doesn't enjoy it.<br /><br />Set over 10 days, Follett moves along the plot at a brisk pace offering many twists and turns.  Jackdaws is in contrast to another recent novel by Follett, Hornet Flight, which seems to have a more deliberate pace and more character development.<br /><br />The characters in Jackdaws are intriguing, with Flick and her husband in the resistance who might be cheating on her and the American officer Paul Chancellor who falls in love with her.  Dieter Frank also has a French mistress who he saved from the concentration camp and therefore is ultmately devoted to him.  The team Flick brings with her to Germany is an interesting group with an aristocrat, a criminal, a lesbian and a transvestite.  The team members get the least attention by Follett, in spite of their interesting backgrounds.<br /><br />I've read many Follett novels, and all of them have been great, except for the Third Twin.  Follett is a master at putting you in the time period he writes about.  It'll be interesting to see how his next novel \\"WhiteOut\\" I believe, fares since it is set in the present day.	2004-08-18

The Body Farm is the first book I've read by Cornwell and it has its strengths and many weaknesses.<br /><br />Since I haven't read any Scarpetta books, its hard to decide where to begin a series.  I chose the body farm because of the plot described on Amazon.  An 11 year old girl is found murdered in the woods and the FBI is trying to solve the crime.  The opening scene with all involved personal discussing the crime is quite interesting.<br /><br />Then Scarpetta, her married lover Benton Wesley and Captain Marino travel to the town of the crime to try and solve it.  Cornwell throws in a character from a past novel Temple Gault as a possible suspect, but that never rings true because he never gets enough development to be a suspect in this book.  The fun part of the book was try to sift through the evidence to find out what actually happened to the little girl.<br /><br />The downside of the book is the niece Lucy, who is a lesbian, and who really cares about her internship.  An investigation into Lucy's work at the FBI is stretched to tie into the case of the dead little girl, but most of it is there just to stretch the length of the book.<br /><br />Cornwell does little to establish the characters in this book, so I have no sympathy or reason to know why Scarpetta is sleeping with a married man or why Wesley is cheating on his wife.  He seems like a jerk who is leading Scarpetta along just to get some action on the side.<br /><br />The actual \\"Body Farm\\" has little to do with the novel.  The ending and the identity of the actual killer happens to quickly or to easily.  The only think we hear about the killer is Scarpetta's fears of how she is scared of this \\"evil\\" person.  Since we don't learn of the evil first hand, its hard to feel to much about what happens at the end.<br /><br />Sometimes when you read a series you feel like you have to read all the books in the series because it is so good.  The Scarpetta series had its chance and blew it, because the Body Farm isn't that good of a book.series you feel like you have to read all the books in the series because it is so good.

Kill the Messenger differs from her previous novels for me in that the strength lies in the characters and not in the mystery of who the killer was.<br /><br />Hoag's last book, Dark Horse, had so many twists and turns, all revolving around who the killer was.  In Kill the Messenger, there are twists and turns especially at the climax about who the killer is and why.<br /><br />Kevin Parker is the disgraced LA detective trying to find out who killed low life lawyer Lenny Lowell.  Was it his daughter, one of his clients, or prime suspect, Jace Damon, the bike messenger who was delivering a package for Lowell before he got killed.<br /><br />Damon has the package, a bunch of film negatives, and someone wants to kill him to get those negatives.  The strength of the novel is Damon's quest to find out who is after him and Parker trying to locate Damon.  This is a good novel, but Hoag does have the problem of why didn't Damon just develop the negatives, then the case would have been solved.  Not a major problem, but still an obvious solution.	2004-08-02

I've read several, but not all, and this novel sticks out because of its strong characterization and tragic turns of events. On Follett's website, he calls this an &quot;Edwardian&quot; novel. I don't know what that means, but this book has a different feel to it.<br /><br /> The &quot;man&quot; from St. Petersburg is Felix, a Russian anarchist conspiring to kill Prince Olav and prevent Russia from entering WWI on the side of the English. Felix comes to England and makes his plans and is ready to kill Olav as he rides in a stagecoach, when he sees a woman who is his long lost lover.<br /><br /> That woman is Lidia, Olav's aunt. It seems too convenient that Lydia would reappear in Felix's life now, but that conflict is the basis for the entire novel. Felix is still in love with Lydia, and Lydia with Felix. But Lydia is now married to the Earl of Walden, Stephen and has a daughter named Charlotte. Stephen is negotiating a treaty with Olav to get Russia's help in WWI, and Lydia is torn between her love for her old flame and her current husband.<br /><br /> Several things stick out in the novel. First, Follett spends a lot of time on Felix, covering his life and his background. Felix is a despicable character and I kept hoping he would fail. Yet his actions drive the entire story.<br /><br /> Lydia was probably the most disappointing character. She loves Steven yet is willing to risk his life for the love of Felix who she last saw 19 years ago. She was a freak in her obsession for Felix. She is so weak-willed and it is frustrating because she had so many chances to do what was right.<br /><br /> Charlotte, their daughter, was raised in ignorance about everything. So when she turns 18 and begins to learn about sex and war and women's suffering, she starts to rebel against her parents because they kept so many things from her. Charlotte is not a bad person, but continually makes bad choices because of the way society thought she should be raised.<br /><br /> The rules of English society in 1914 meant no one could really say how the felt, and that caused many problems.<br /><br /> Lydia loved her husband Steven and Charlotte loved her father, yet they made so many choices that could harm him all because of lack of communication or out of fondness for Felix.<br /><br /> The end ties things up nicely, although a few things happen that I would deem &quot;unforgiveable&quot;, but since they are kept a secret, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br /> This Follett book had less sex that some of his others but retains the strong characterization that make him such a great author. Follett excels in writing period pieces that bring out the little details of what life was like in an earlier period.<br /><br /> I listened to this book on audio tape and highly recommend it.es because of the way society thought she should be raised.  <br />  <br /> The rules of English society in 1914 meant no one could really say how the felt, and that caused many problems.  <br />  <br /> Lydia loved her husband Steven and Charlotte loved her father, yet they made so many choices that could harm him all because of lack of communication or out of fondness for Felix. <br />  <br /> The end ties things up nicely, although a few things happen that I would deem &quot;unforgiveable&quot;, but since they are kept a secret, it doesn't really matter. <br />  <br /> This Follett book had less sex that some of his others but retains the strong characterization that make him such a great author.

The novel opens with Paraguayan journalist Rudi Hernendez working on a story.  With some equimpment he records a secret conversation between several Germans living in his country.  What is on that tape is enough to get him in deep trouble, and he is abruptly killed about 1/6 into the novel.  So far, the novel is interesting and captivating.<br />The rest of Brandenburg destroys all of that goodwill it built up in the first 80 pages by detouring into a convoluted mess of characters and clues and ultimate boredom.  Joe Volkmann is part of a European &quot;FBI&quot; and joins up with Rudi's cousin, Erica Krantz, to find out what happened to Rudi.  They traverse Paraguay looking for clues and find a picture at an abandoned mansion from 1931 of German girl on the arms of a soldier.<br />Who owned the mansion and who is the girl and what do German extremists have to do with it.  At this point, the novel degenerates into uselessness.  The best way to describe it is Volkmann going on a massive investigation.  Each step turns up new characters, each interview reveals little.  Any new information is usually info to aid Volkmann in his next interview, and has nothing to do with the ultimate plot.<br />Soon, all of the characters run together and overwhelm what little evidence the plot has given me.  This novel is way to long.  The search for the truth is tedious and boring.  I don't recommend you read this novel.	2004-07-19

Kelso is told a story about the night Stalin died by a former guard of Stalins.  This sets Kelso on a quest to find an infamous notebook that Stalin carried with him during all the final days.<br />While set in modern Russia, the novel is filled with segments of history on Stalin which enlighten us about the type of person he was as well as in a way set up the ending.<br />The conclusion of the novel happens a-matter-of-factly, with no great surprise or relevation on the part of the author.<br />This is a good novel with the writing somewhat shifty making me wonder if I missed something.  But there is nothin hidden in this novel of a few characters on the quest for a long-buried secret.  The premise of the secret is somewhat foolish yet still entertaining.	2004-07-02
US	50320963	R3GQGBD7IWRV8X	0345434498	323396054	Hostage: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	An exciting thriller	Robert Crais' &quot;Hostage&quot; is a stand alone thriller that at first glance, didn't seem like it could hold my interest because the action occurs over one night.  But Crais does a masterful job of creating enjoyable characters and injecting enough twists to carry the novel through the slow middle parts.<br />The action begins with losers Kevin, Dennis and Mars deciding to rob a convinience store in the suburbs.  The robbery goes bad and a man is shot and on the getaway the car breaks down, forcing the thugs to escape through a ritzy neighborhood on foot.  They plan to steal a car and make their getaway but the police are on their tail.  Before they can escape, the police have them trapped.  Dennis, the older brother and the leader, Kevin, the younger brother who really is an okay kid if it weren't for the influence of Dennis, and the loner Mars are all trapped in a house and they hold the Smith family hostage.<br />Jeff Talley, chief of police, is called to the scene.  Talley has experience in these situations as a hostage negotiator.  One bad experience forced him to quit the SWAT team and caused him to lose his family.  Now he has to overcome his fears to ensure the safety of the family inside the house.<br />The novel seems pretty straight forward up to this point when Crais throws in a new plot twist.  George Smith, one of the hostages, is an accountant for the Mafia with evidence that would incrimate families in LA and NY.  The mafia then takes steps to ensure none of the evidence reaches the police.<br />The story moves back and forth between the point of view of Talley, the mafia, the hostages and Dennis and Kevin.  Crais does a great job with the characters of Dennis and Kevin.  You really can understand why Dennis has turned to crime and why Kevin is following him.  Mars is an intriguing character (almost comical when listening to the audio book) whose motives are much more sinister than they appear.<br />The ending is satisfying and expected.  I'll definitely look into more Crais novels.definitely look into more Crais novels.	2004-06-30

All ten stories were amusing but nothing startling or shocking.  All stories were lighthearted, with no violence, sex or swearing.<br />Some reviewers mentioned each story ending with a twist, and that intrigued me because the \\"twist\\" ending hadn't gained popularity when these stories were written.<br />The twists were all pretty obvious but still each story was easy and fun to read.	2004-06-22

I have a new \\"worst book I've ever read\\" on my list after trudging through this garbage for the last three weeks.  First Team has two things going for it.  First, the book summary on the jacket because that is the only hope you have of following the plot, and second, the captions beginning each chapter that indicate where the characters are.<br />Larry Bond's books have all been high quality novels, even though the last one he wrote wasn't as good.  But he hasn't written anything in awhile then returns with this effort with co-author Jim Defilice.  I don't know who wrote what, but somewhere along the line, they really botched this book up.<br />The story involves a team that operates outside the law tracking terrorists.  It has CIA man Fergeson, two special forces memberts Rankins and Connors and a marine called Guns.  They are on the trail of terrorists trying to prevent a dirty bomb being set off in the USA.<br />I seriously considered quitting this book after about 100 pages.  At this point the problem wasn't the storytelling, but the horrendeous dialogue among the \\"First Team\\".  I guess the authors were trying to add character to these people, but every other word was a joke or a lewd comment.  This detracted from the story because it often seemed forced and out of place and incredibly unrealistic.  I doubt soldiers trade crass jokes in the heat of battle.<br />The horrible dialogue tapers off somewhat and then the horrible story takes over.  The authors can't describe scenery at all and do a horrible job of telling the reader why characters are in Iran, then in Russia, then split up into teams, then together.  Why are they following a train?  Why do they stop?  How do they get to a US airbase from following a train?  Those easy questions are never answered.<br />This book has the typical computer nerd working in a messy office at headquarters and he finds some useful info and shares it with the team in the field.  Or at least I think he did.  What he finds out and tracks makes no sense.  The authors mention a May 11 memo.  Where did this come from.  Did I miss its introduction early in the novel?<br />The president of the USA sends a sexy 26 year old attorney who amazingly has gone through special forces training out in the field to go with the \\"Team\\" and to make all key decisions.  Ridiculous.<br />The \\"authors\\" do a horrible job of setting up the premsis for the existence of the \\"First Team.\\"  They do a baq job of writing characters and dialogue.  They have no clue about telling a story.<br />This book is horrible.  Please don't read it!!!!!and tracks makes no sense.  The authors mention a May 11 memo.  Where did this come from.

Tycoon spans an epic 50 years and tells the story of Jack Lear.  Jack buys a radio station with the help of his father-in-law and turns that station into a radio then television empire spanning the country.<br />Tycoon is about the characters, and there are many.  Robbins creates many characters and I'm surprised that after reading, so many of them made an impression on me.  Robbins' story doesn't dwell too deeply on the motives of the characters, but instead just describes the actions of the characters, which speak for themselves.<br />Lear has his three wives and many mistresses and business associates.  Lear's kids, Jack and Joni are also fun to read about as are his employees Sally Allen and Curt Frederickson.  Jack's family is also interesting.  They are the same type of people as he.<br />Lear seems to have a good marriage with his first wife Kimberly, yet he cheats on her constantly.  This is my biggest problem with the novel.  There is a lot of sex in Tycoon, a lot described in great detail.  Yet Robbins never puts it in context.  We never hear how Lear feels about cheating on his wife.  We never hear about any reasons the characters might have cheated on on their respective spouses.  And this is frustrating because using sex in a story can be very effective in a novel if there is a reason for it.<br />Jack Lear would've been a better character if he felt any remorse for cheating, or if he enjoyed it.  Instead it is presented as a given, natural thing to do (as it is with all characters in the novel).<br />Tycoon is a sprawling novel with many memorable characters.  The incest between Jack's kids seems a little unnecessary yet it shows Robbins isn't afraid to touch any subject.<br />The climax really isn't one because it involves Lear fighting to save the station, and since I really didn't care about him, I didn't care if he was successful.  This novel is good because it tells a good story about many people.  Yet afer reading I realized none of the characters were nice people and so I don't know how many more Robbins novels I'll read.ry about many people.

US	50320963	R1V8CJGGR1B1ML	0451209303	442800937	The Unlikely Spy	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A great WWII spy novel	Daniel Silva's debut novel is incredible on many fronts.  First, for a debut novel, it has incredible depth and substance.  It has great characterization and many twists.<br />The novel is set in WWII as Germany tries to find the secret to the D-Day invasion and England tries to keep them from getting that secret.  I read one review which said Silva made up facts about the deception and what actually occurred during that time.  For me that didn't matter (if that's true) because the true story is about the spies and the chase.  The secrets they are peddling are of secondary importance.<br />The story revolves around Catherine Blake, a German spy in England who is stealing secrets from Peter Jordan, an American helping the British prepare for the invasion.  Catherine Blake is a great character who seems to regret what she is doing as a spy but also views it as a game that she is competing to win.  At the end of the novel as the authorities close in, Blake becomes a much less of an interesting person, but the setup Silva gives her in the beginning is great.<br />The man trying to stop the spies is a professor named Alfred Vicary.  He is an older man with many regrets yet he is great at what he does.  He does a great job of piecing together the info needed to catch the spies.<br />This novel has many twists and turns and Silva does something many authors don't that I only noticed because he included it.  Silva actually includes the scenes of suspicious behavior.  So, instead of having Vicary being suspicious of Boothby, his boss, Silva writes a scene of Boothby doing suspicous behavior.  This made me wonder what was Boothby actually doing (as were the other characters) instead of just relying on what Vicary thinks.<br />A great line uttered by Vicary sums up the suspense of the twists and turns of the novel.  Vicary is interviewing Peter Jordan, the American architect.  After hours of intense questioning, Vicary asks, almost as an afterthought, &quot;You are Peter Jordan, aren't you?&quot;  This makes me wonder if one of the most straight foward characters isn't what he seems.<br />This novel builds up to a great twist at the end and it does a great job of explaining all that went on before it.  The twist for me was good, but not the best.  I can't wait to read more of Silva's books.dan, aren't you?&quot;  This makes me wonder if one of the most straight foward characters isn't what he seems.<br />This novel builds up to a great twist at the end and it does a great job of explaining all that went on before it.

US	50320963	RNG5PDAF0PIP9	0451145577	222810062	The Seventh Secret (Signet)	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Great premise, bad book	The Seventh Secret is a WWII novel written by Irving Wallace 19 years ago.  Wallace has since passed away, but his novel stands out in both good and bad terms.  Great WWII novels take certain true events in the war and offer a fictional perspective on why they happened, or they tell us that what we think happened didn't really.  In the Seventh Secret, Wallace proposes that Hitler and Eva Braun actually survived the war.<br />The strength of the novel is the evidence that proves Hitler and Braun lived.  The evidence follows a painting possibly painted after the war by Hitler, dental records, body doubles and hidden bunkers.  If only Wallace had surrounded this evidence with solid characters who did things that make since.<br />Instead, Wallace throws in Hitler biographer Emily Ashcroft, American architect Rex Walters, a Russian Museum curator and an Israeli Mossad Agent.  These four characters converge on Germany for different reasons and all take turns interviewing Germans (all of who are incredibly still alive and willing to talk) to find out relevant information about Hitler.  The four characters have no depth and seem bonded together for illogical reasons.  Emily Ashcroft seems to be able to get everything done, while the Mossad agent Tovah seems incompetent (after a good introduction to her character by Wallace.)<br />The premise of the novel is great, but Wallace did a bad job of telling the story.  He seems to throw in the fate of Hitler as an afterthought.  It would be great to see a quality writer pick up this premise and write a good novel about it.	2004-05-06
US	50320963	R19V90IW15G16L	0446607711	702857631	The Simple Truth	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Quite dissapointing	This is my third Baldacci book and none have been as good as I'd hope.  The Simple Truth is like no other book I've read.  The plot kept my interest all the way to the end, and all of the characters were well defined with distict personalities.  Yet this novel had many deficiencies.  Baldacci failed to combine the plot and characters into an exciting story.<br />Rufus Harms files an appeal with the Supreme Court stating his innocence.  Brother of slain court clerk John Fiske and clerk Sara Evans race to find out what really happened to Harms while being pursued by several people, some friend, some foe.<br />The action scenes were horribly done, I often skipped over them.  During the final shootout, characters appeared out of nowhere just to advance the plot.  The flow of the story was non existant.  Baldacci did a horrible job of putting a time frame into the story.  I just finished reading and I have no idea of the action in the book lasted two days or two weeks.  It seems like the events just ran together with no time of day ever given as reference.<br />All of Baldacci's books sound good based on the plot, but The Simple Truth fails to deliver an  exciting story.	2004-04-20
US	50320963	R1KJEWAQHFL6J2	0525946896	712732369	Hornet Flight	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Typical high quality Follett novel	Hornet Flight is another great book by English author Ken Follett.  Set in Denmark in WWII, a young boy named Harold must find away to get some secrets back to England after all other means have failed.  He is pursued by the policeman Peter Fleming, a childhood friend of Harold's brother who now hates Harold's family.<br />I listened to this book on Audio-Tape and found it very interesting and well-read.<br />I have several observations about this book.<br />Hornet Flight is different than most WWII novels in that it focuses a lot more on characters and their lives as opposed to actual events of World War II.  In this way, it is like other Follett books where all characters are done well yet so many characters are the same from book to book.  Still this isn't a fault, because I enjoy Follett's books from beginning to end because of the quality characterization (as oppossed to some books where the entire book is read to get to the payoff at the end.)<br />Peter Fleming, the bad guy in the book, has some human qualities at first, especially as he cares for his handicapped wife.  Fleming's anger over what happened to his wife turns him into a hateful person focused only on stopping Harold.  Peter and his partner Tilde never seem that bad because they appear to be doing what the police would have to do in a country run by Nazis.  They are just doing their duty.<br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for a strong character based, action novel.  If you are turned off by the swastika on the cover, don't be, because while this book is set in WWII, its quality is not dependent upon that fact.	2004-04-06
US	50320963	RO9CQ46ZUAJWN	0316603570	335598141	3rd Degree	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Fizzles out at the end	When reading James Patterson, you have to compare his works to his other novels, and not to other authors, because as he continues to churn out fiction, the perceived value of each book falls because he writes so many.  So, 3rd Degree was verging on five stars until the last 40 pages or so, then fell to a three star book.  The ending provided no punch or excitement, or really even surprises.<br />The book starts out with a terrorist group called August Spies targeting people related to the G8 summitt being held in San Fransisco.  The entire city is in a panic and the Women's Murder Club is on the case, trying to find the left wing wackos that are behind the murders.  Patterson is respectful I feel with the terrorism issue.  He throws in the Department of Homeland Security and makes a few references to 9/11, but doesn't become too sentimental about it.<br />3rd Degree stands out from Alex Cross noves in that in this book, the police actually investigate.  Patterson actually takes the time to tell the reader how the investigation is going.  In Cross novels, Patterson tells us Cross is investigating, but never tells us what he's finding out.<br />Lyndsey, Cindy, Jill and Claire all pitch in to uncover the identity of the terrorists, and their motives and the motives have a few layers, which is really the only good twist in the book.<br />I'll recommend this book because it is fun and quick, but the ending is quite boring.	2004-04-01
US	50320963	R3SCT14THBXU4Y	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Better than Da Vinci Code	Angels and Demons is the predecessor to the ultra-successful Da Vinci Code.  Symboligist Robert Langdon is introduced in this book and author Dan Brown takes the reader on a crazy journey through Rome as the Catholic Church struggles to survive.<br />I read the Da Vinci Code first and hated it, but after reading both Deception Point and Angels and Demons, I believe Dan Brown is a good author who just failed miserably with the Da Vinci Code.<br />In Angels and Demons, Langdon must search through all of Rome for clues to help him find a hidden bomb that will destroy the Vatican.  A lot of this book seems like a history lesson as Langdon, the Swiss Guard of the Vatican and Victoria Vettra rush to find the bomb.  The main difference in Angels and Demons is that while Langdon deciphers many clues, he is ultimately trying to stop a terrorist organization from destroying the Vatican.  In the Da Vinci Code, Langdon solves riddles and clues just to finally solve the ultimate riddle.  The purpose of the novel is the final riddle, which really leaves no bad guys and causes the Da Vinci Code to read like an encyclopedia of art history.<br />Angels and Demons is a long book (perhaps 100 pages too long, as Brown throws in another twist when the book could be over).  The book is respectful of the church and Christians unlike the Da Vinci Code, which bashed the church.  Brown does however let his disdain for all organized religions show when a character says that religion must evolve like science and move past churches and that each person can find God inside themselves.<br />Readers should overlook Brown's personal dislike of the Church and realize this is a good, exciting over-the-top novel that is fun to read.  I recommend you read this book, then stop, because the Da Vinci Code is much worse.	2004-03-29

I enjoyed this novel and kept reading day after day because of the intriguing premise that Germany actually won WWII and its empire continued going strong 20 years later.<br />Frederich March, a police officer, discovers several dead bodies and is soon on a trail trying to find what the deaths of high ranking German officers mean.  He is aided by an American reporter who also serves as the love interest but whose main purpose is to get the info out of the country once March discovers the &quot;secret&quot; the novel is based on.<br />The twists and turns and characters and the pursuit of March by the Gestapo are all intriguing, but as it is with all historical novels, the quality of the novel will be determined by the author's take his own version of events.<br />What stands out in Fatherland is the entire premise of Germany winning WWII.  Many countries don't exist anymore and Germany is a world leader.  But most details Harris includes are changes inside Germany, which are quite similar to the way Germany operated before WWII.<br />In conclusion, the big secret March discovers (which isn't really a secret) is indeed big, but will it destroy the German empire.  In this alternate universe, it should, but many evil countries are thriving today that have committed the same atrocities.	2004-03-15

Willie Traynor is the narrator for this novel in which he buys the local newspaper at the young age of 23 and through this position witnesses all the ups and downs of the town for a decade.<br />When a local woman is raped and murdered, Danny Padgitt is put on trial and convicted.  Padgitt, related to a family of thieves and crooks, threatens the jury.  Padgitt is sentenced to life instead of the death penalty, and is paroled in ten years.  You learn this much by reading the summary of the book.<br />Grisham then spends much time bringing the town of Clanton to life while slowly moving the plot along.  Traynor befriends an elderly black woman named Callie Ruffin and often hangs out with Harry Rex Vonner.  Traynor visits every church in the county and joins the fight in Walmart type stores invading small towns.<br />While Traynor is the narrator of the story, I never got involved much with his character.  While he is a reporter, he sees almost everything, he never really does much.  I think Grisham intended Traynor to be the eyes through which we view this small town and all its charms.  The plot moves along too slowly at times, but when it does pick up at the end, you feel like you know everything there is to know about the town and its people.<br />Grisham is still one of the best out there.  This novel is long and somewhat complex (especially when compared to some other efforts like the Summons.)  I enjoyed this amusing and entertaining look at small town life and all of its crazy characters.  I recommend this Grisham book to anyone.	2004-02-17
US	50320963	R17WX01KJTXENC	0446676098	430421115	The Notebook	Books	1	6	10	N	N	What am I missing here, this book was bad	As a man, I'm somewhat embarrased to admit I read this book.  But my wife read it and liked it and since it is so short (hardly worthy of being a novel), I thought I'd read it.<br />The first three fourths of the book is your plain old generic plot.  A woman (Allie) is in love (Lon) but used to love another man named Noah.  She sees Noah again a few weeks before her wedding after not seeing him for 14 years and suddenly has doubts about her relationship with Noah.<br />The Notebook, like so many other love stories of this ilk, ignores the man who is scorned.  Allie spent one summer with Noah when she was 15.  She dated Lon for 4 years and said yes when he proposed.  Reading this story, I wondered how shallow Allie was to date a man for 4 years then dump him so easily.<br />The above is my complaint about the Notebook as a man.  Being objective, this book was still horrible.  Inserting lines from famous poets doesn't make a man romantic.  Also, this book is full of Allie and Noah telling each other how much they love each other.  Sparks told us how much they loved each other, instead of showing.  I wish they scene where Allie makes her choice would have been written.<br />It gets repetitive and boring.  Also, nothing really happens in this book.  The jacket description is really decpetive because it implies some sort of climax or twist at the end, istead of more poetry describing love.	2004-02-05

Even at 370 pages, this is a quick read.<br />Dr. Carrier is a pschyciatrist at a big city hospital.  His girlfriend has recently been murdered.  Dr. Authur Chess befriends him and at the same time Carrier begins receiving strange packages and notes leading him to clues about various killings and killers.<br />This book is from the point of view of Dr. Carrier.  It covers his relationships with his patients, coworkers and new girlfriend Angela.<br />The unique part of this book is there is absolutely no forshadowing or hint of what is to come.  You read about everthing as it happens to Dr. Carrier.  Nothing much happens in the book, but you do get to follow Dr. Carrier's journey as he is slowly lead on a path that could lead answers or more death.<br />The Conspiracy Club of the title not really part of the book, yet its existence does leave a few unanswered questions.  Those aren't really relevant to this review.<br />I enjoyed this book, and might actually give Kellerman's books another shot after not being impressed with his first one.	2004-02-02

Deception Point is as good as DaVinci Code is bad.<br />NASA has made a discovery in the Artcic and invites civilian scientists to verify its authenticity.  The scientists make a startling discovery and from there the chase is on as Rachel Sexton (daughter of presidential candidate Sedgewick Sexton), Michael Tolland and Corky Marlinson must outwit the Delta Force team on their tail.  The book throws many twists and turns at you.<br />I had a few complaints.  The plot revolves around NASA as the center of a presidential election, which even today seems incredibly far fetched.  Also, the ending is somewhat of a let down between Senator Sexton and Rachel.<br />The fun of this books is following the characters and their pursuit for the truth.  Their discoveries aren't that amazing, but the trials they go through to make those discoveries had me on the edge of my seat.	2004-01-27

Unfortunately, I don't think the publisher read the book first.<br />Da Vinci Code is about a symologist who gets brought into a murder case and ends up breaking codes after codes until he discovers the secret of the Holy Grail.<br />Your view of Christianity will have a big impact on how you view this book.  I happen to not believe Brown's premise, but the book could have been good if Brown had made it as good as some of his other novels.<br />As Brown unveils each new answer to a code, it reads like an encyclopedia of art history and hidden symbols in famous paintings.  While intriguing, Brown fails to make it interesting, especially for a novel.  Brown would have written a better novel (in my opinion) if the characters had to overcome doubt about what they were discovering.  But that wasn't the case.  As each new &quot;supposed truth&quot; is discovered, the characters accept it as fact, in the same way that modern day Christians accept the facts about Jesus (and Brown criticizes this blidn faith).<br />Brown has written good books, this just isn't one of them.	2004-01-26

Deception Point is as good as DaVinci Code is bad.  There may be many readers who read DaVinci Code first and moved onto Dan Brown's other thrillers.  That is what I did and I'm glad because from page 1, Deception Point is an engrossing thriller.<br />NASA has found a meteor in the Artic and the President of the USA sends civillian scientists to confirm NASA's startling discovery.  What they find ignites a page turning cat and mouse game where nothing is quite what it seems.  <br />The plot is somewhat implausible in that NASA is at the center of a presidential election.  Also, I found the twists and turns and plot points not to be that surprising.  But what made this book great was not finding out what the big NASA conspiracy was, but following the characters as they learned about each new twist and turn.<br />Brown puts his civilian scientists Tolland and Sexton and Corky through some tough moments and situations, and they manage to survive.  The ending of the book was a letdown, but the journey is what made this book fun to read.	2004-01-26
US	50320963	R2QDRUDJJU5C9Z	0312962118	999720718	Snow Wolf	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Solid Historical Thriller	Snow Wolf tells the story of 4 people who, in 1953, are part of a plan to assissinate Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin.  The set up of the story is somewhat slow with Jake Massey's son investigating the truth of how his dad died in Moscow in 1953.  He meets up with Anna Khorev who tells him the entire story in incredible detail.<br />The first half of Snow Wolf describes Alex Slanski and Anna Khorev's training in Massachusets while Massey and Henry Libel make plans once the spies are in Russia.  A lot of scenes in the novel seem out of place, but eventually all of the characters have a place.  Still, the novel doesn't pick up steam until the characters are in Russia.  Once their, KGB officer Yuri Lukin is put in charge of a massive manhunt for the US Spies.<br />There are several twists and turns and several close calls, and Meade resolves everything a bit too neatly.  This is still a great historical thriller and I recommend it to anyone.	2004-01-14

The plot is very intriguing, and the first half of this book that covers that 15 days is exciting as Starks tries to dig his way out of the brilliantly planned attack by one of his former patients.<br />There are plenty of twists including an obvious one that none the less surprised me that allows Starks to turn the tables on his pursuers.<br />The ending of the book is also exciting and the final few pages are very interesting.<br />I did have a few complaints.  Dr. Starks is an analyst and while the story revolves around this fact, it seems any profession could have been used.  Maybe a few more plot points revolving around Starks' profession would have made this book more than a standard cat and mouse novel.<br />Also, one of the secondary bad guys seems to be a stretch and doesn't add much to the final believability of the true bad guy.<br />Also, in this 500 page novel, Starks is alone.  The story would've been better if Starks had a friend or a lover or family to share is dilemma with.<br />Despite the above, I really enjoyed this novel.	2003-12-19
US	50320963	R30DESYZYV4UDP	0316602906	981192109	The Big Bad Wolf	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Easy to read, typically disappointing	Alex Cross returns in Patterson's latest thriller, the Big Bad Wolf.  As with all Patterson novels, they are easy and quick to read.  In this thriller, Cross has joined the FBI and his involved in searching for who his behind a bunch of kidnappings.  The FBI and Cross are soon on the trail and have several hit and misses as they try and find kidnap victims before they are killed and try and find those involved in the kidnapping scheme.<br />Although part of the novel involves Cross's personal life, it isn't as dominant as in recent efforts.  Most Patterson villians seem to be smarter than those after them, but the Wolf actually is believable as a super criminal.<br />A few complaints:  Patterson never includes enough details of anything, so just read and go with the flow and don't think you missed something, because you didn't.  Also, the conclusion is incredibly frustrating.  This book isn't worthy of a sequal, although it'll probably have one.<br />Patterson still throws in the required twists and turns, yet he has lost the ability to make me care about the characters in his novels.	2003-12-02
US	50320963	R2BK6IEYTRN4OB	0446531588	703746704	Derailed	Books	5	0	1	N	N	An exciting thriller!	Derailed features Charles Schine, an ad executive who makes a lot of money, has a beautiful wife and a teenage daughter.  Charles meets a beautiful woman on a train and begins talking to her.  Charles convinces himself that his marriage isn't as good as it used to be for various reasons, and therefore he needs the relationship with this woman.  The flirting continues and before you know it, they begin an affair.<br />That is the beginning of the end for Charles Shine, because his life then truly begins to unravel.  The life of his family is threatened and Charles loses everything.  But Charles does manage to regroup and pull his life back together.<br />A previous reviewer says Charles seems like an unsympathetic character who continually makes the wrong choices.  But I see Charles who made a choice to have an affair, then after that nothing was under his control.  Author James Siegel portrays Charles Shine as a man cheating on his wife and then shows the steps Shine takes to keep his family from finding out.  Just how far will Charles go to keep his family from knowing his betrayal.  Siegel in a way puts a priority in the scheme of criminal acts with Charles, having him making many terrible choices in order to avoid telling his wife he cheated on her.<br />There is one act in the novel that is a major turning point.  It seems incredibly unrealistic (and somewhat bigoted against Christians) but at the same time I don't think it hurts the novel's credibility.<br />I enjoyed this book a lot.  Seigel definitely tried hard to present an enjoyable story with plenty of plot twists and he succeeded.	2003-11-19
US	50320963	RDXMDQT37DJ2I	0743238087	191061509	Havana: An Earl Swagger Novel	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Hunter bites off more than he can chew	This is the third in a series of Earl Swagger novels.  In Hot Springs, Swagger battles crime bosses in a action packed thriller in which 1940's Hot Springs came alive.  It Pale Horse Coming, Swagger battles evil prison guards and brings justice to many long suffering people.  In Havana, I'm not really sure what happens.<br />In Havana, Swagger is sent to Cuba to safeguard a congressman who is taking a trip their.  In reality, the CIA wants Swagger to kill Castro.  But then there are other story lines:  the communist sniper, the mafia hitman Frankie, the Cuban secret policeman, and the mafia.  Havana felt like a puzzle that was thrown together haphazardly.  Early in the book, each short chapter is dedicated to a different story line, and for the longest time, none of the stories are connected.  Its hard to get into a book when you have to start from scratch with each chapter like you are reading a new book.<br />Another problem with Havana is that the stories are somewhat related, but not all.  Usually in a novel, all story lines will meld into one coherent story, but here you have the hitman with the Cubans, the Russian with Swagger, the CIA in the mix.  Too much is going on.  Hunter does do a great job of bringing pre-Castro Cuba alive, and that alone was worth reading the novel for.<br />My final complaint is:  who is the bad guy.  In the last 2 Swagger novels, he clearly knows who is evil and he takes care of them with ease.  In Havana, every reader will know that Castro survives, yet 2/3 of the novel is spent chasing after Castro.  Only at the end of the novel does a new enemy appear and by then, I don't hate them enough to care for Swagger to kill them.  Also, I question Swagger's motives for killing them when it appeared to me there were more evil characters who deserved killing.	2003-11-12
US	50320963	R1VSJ3LSPKA707	0449225151	474485511	Place Called Freedom	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Typical Follett, Great Characters and Story	After one chapter, I knew how the story would end, but that didn't change my enjoyment of A Place Called Freedom.  Follett explores the life of lowly coal miner Mac who longs to be free and free-spirited Lizzie who has a disdain for the social classes of her time.<br />Still she marries Jay Jamison and she truly loves him.  Jay Jamison is an interesting Follett character.  This book compares with a Dangerous Fortune in plot and scope, but that book had clearly defined good and evil characters.  Jay and Lizzie were in love, and through actions of their family, their love was destroyed.  Still, to the end Jay always cared for Lizzie.  Still, his devotion to power and greed and to please his family mattered more.<br />Follett is great at developing characters and educating the reader on the certain time period.  Follett details the day to day life and the character's interaction with social norms very well.<br />I haven't read too many of Follet's WWII novels or spy novels and look forward to moving on to those.  I've read six Follett books, and only the Third Twin was bad.	2003-10-28
US	50320963	RWDD9BB13IPS0	0385511612	430694437	Bleachers	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A perfect little story	Bleachers, Grisham's latest, is by no means perfect or the best work he's ever done, but if you take it for what it is, it doesn't get any better than this.<br />Bleachers is about a Neely Crenshaw who peaked in life during high school, and in his first visit back to his home town in 15 years, he struggles to come to terms with his past as a hero and his present as a divorced real-estate broker.<br />The story revolves around high-school football, which might bore those who enjoy Grisham's legal thrillers.  But Grisham tells this story well.  Neely Cresnhaw was a great quarterback for the Messina Spartans, worshiped by all, whose career in college was ended because of an injury.  I think everyone who reads this can relate because accomplishments in high school rarely translate to your position or standing as an adult.  Grisham examines an entire town that views life as beginning and ending with high school football.<br />I give this book five stars because of its simplicity.  As stated above, this book is about Neely Crenshaw coming to terms with his hero status in high school, the girl he dumped, and the coach he thought he hated.  Grisham had an idea for Bleachers and I think it was accomplished with brilliance.<br />But that is also the problem with this story.  It isn't worthy of being called a novel because it is so short and therefore somewhat of a rip off.  Also, the premise of the book is so narrow that there aren't really any twists or turns or other characters other than Neely and Coach Rake.  But when you are as successful as Grisham, I guess you've earned the right to write stories like this every once in awhile.	2003-10-16

It is only 400 pages and only covers a few characters, Dominic, Brian and Jack, as they join \\"The Campus\\" as America's newest operatives in the war on terror.<br />The Campus operates without governmental knowledge or constraints and therefore is able to do what most Americans hope our government is actually doing, and that is taking the war on terror to the terrorists turf.  The campus seeks out terrorists and kills them on their own turf.<br />This book covers the recruitment and training of brothers Dominic and Brian, and their cousin Jack.  Soon they are ready and out on there own battling the terrorists.<br />There is a lot of action in this book.  Things actually happen, whereas in Red Rabbit absolutely nothing happened.  But there are a lot of negatives.  Clancy has created his own world that coexists with the real world, so you can have 9-11 happen as well as nuclear bombs going off at football games like in the Sum of All Fears.  Clancy's dialogue between the twenty-something brothers and their cousin Jack seems a bit corny at times.  It is also ridiculous that Jack is the son of Jack Ryan and his cousins are recruited to the campus by mere coincidence.  This story would have worked better with entirely new characters.<br />This book is good because it isn't incredibly long and it does provide some sort of satisfaction at getting back at the terrorists.  And it definely hints at a sequel.	2003-10-13

Follet throws in some background about Luke, Anthony, Elspeth, and Billie's days at Harvard and then time spent as spies during the war.  The lives of the four are intertwined till the very end and there is love and betrayal at every corner.<br />Follett's strength is his charactarization and his research of the time period and the subject matter.  This is a solid novel that is fun to read, but the end isn't a jolting climax, just a logical ending to all that preceded it.	2003-09-26

The premise of a code hidden in DaVinci's paintings relating to a secret dating back to Christ intgrigued me.<br />Robert Langdon, a professor, and Sophie Noveou, a French Police Officer, spend the entire novel breaking one code after another in search of a religious secret, that if exposed, would ruin the Christian church.<br />This book is bad for a couple of reasons.  First, Langdon and Noveou are some of the most boring characters ever.  All of the characters take back stage to Browns historical descriptions of art and codes and symbols.  This book also earns one star because Brown it isn't that exciting.  Take away the characters and the thin plot, and you have Brown writing about his opinions on the catholic church.  <br />Brown opens the book by telling that Opus Dei and the Priory of Scion really exist.  The book is filled with so much truth that it is hard to know where the truth ends and fiction begins.  But Brown writes everything as if it is true.  This is obviously a novel but Brown probably believes the theory he writes about, or else is wanting to just make a lot of people mad.   <br />As a Christian, it didn't make me mad, just curious.  I wondered if any of this book was true.  This book is interesting, but not really a good novel.	2003-09-15
US	50320963	R1TWGL66GZYQNY	0743234693	844233229	The Footprints of God	Books	2	7	11	N	N	Disappointing work of philosophy...	Without even thinking about it, I expected this to be a great book.  With every effort, Greg Iles has continued to be an innovative, entertaining and unique author.  Footprints of God is definitely innovative and is different than any of Iles other novels.  You will have to read this entire book before you form your own opinion, because the entire book is written for the end.<br />I believe Iles came up with a premise in his mind and then constructed a novel in a way that he could write about a certain subject.  This isn't necessarily bad, but in my opinion, this is Iles' worst novel ever.<br />First of all, the summary on the book jacket tells entirely way too much about the novel, yet it still isn't what the story is about.  Dr. David Tennant and several other gifted scientists are working on a top secret computer called Trinity for the US Government.  Problems arise and a co-worker is murdered and soon Tennant and his pshychiatrist are on the run.<br />The most intriguing aspect of the novel (and ultimately the most disappointing) is the fact that Tennent keeps having dreams about Jesus Christ.  These dreams manage to convince Tennant that the dreams are actually memories and Tennant goes to Israel to find answers.  I imagine most readers have an understanding of the story of Jesus regardless of their belief in God.  I'm not a theologian so I'm not sure how Iles' explanation of Tennant's dreams relates to theology, but for me it was a let down.<br />The climax of the book involves a showdown between Tennant and the super computer Trinity.  He throws in the threat of nuclear war as part of the suspense but it seems out of place when for the entire book we've been led to be expecting a showdown with Trinity, a computer with the ability to think a million times faster than humans.  I kept waiting for Iles to reveal some sort of secret or mystery but instead he rambles on about his theories on God and the universe.  To me, they were just far enough out of the mainstream to make me not like this novel.<br />In conclusion, Iles does a good job of explaining the science behind Trinity enough for me to believe it.  But he fails in providing any action or intrigue.  He started out promising with tying science to religion but veered off in the end where it seemed he was spouting his own opinion on the nature of man and the fate of the universe.eam to make me not like this novel.<br />In conclusion, Iles does a good job of explaining the science behind Trinity enough for me to believe it.

Unfortunately, no one in Annie's family has the guts to deal with it, except maybe her twin brother Andy from whom some details of Annie's past have been hidden to protect him.<br />Each story of Annie's past provides possible clues as to why she is crazy and each story reveals a bit about all the main characters as they all struggle in the present to find where Annie has ran off to this time.<br />Basically this novel is about Annie's family coming to terms with her craziness, and that covers about 208 pages.  I believe Hunter could have added to this novel to make it better.  This novel would have been a lot better if there had been a resolution to why Annie was crazy.  Hunter definitely has the skill to throw in a plot twist about something dramatic in Annie's past that caused her to go insane, but he leaves us with a story of several people's lives and the book ends with them continuing to live.  There really is no climax.  I guess Hunter has earned the right to write whatever he chooses, but that still doesn't change the fact that this bare-bones novel could have been much better.	2003-08-21
US	50320963	R2YXP5O0CGD5JQ	0446606243	58879561	The Tenth Justice	Books	3	2	3	N	N	a decent 1st book, but many flaws exist	The Tenth Justice was probably a good book for a first author, but when comparing it to First Counsel, Metzer's third book, it fails to compare. I had hoped Tenth Justice would provide as much as an inside look at the Supreme Court as First Counsel did of the White House, but it doesn't come close. The Tenth Justice revolves around Ben Addison and his fellow supreme court clerk Lisa and Ben's three friends.<br />None of the action occurs with the supreme court and we only get to hear Ben and friends talk about it, we never get a feel for the court. That said, this book has other problems. Metzer fills his book with dialogue that I guess is supposed to be witty and provide characterization. It does neither well because all of the dialogue blends together.<br />The plot is decent and there are a few surprises and twists, but nothing is too surprising. Metzer is a decent author, but if your looking for a legal thriller, this isn't it. The law is the setting but the story is the characters and how they get out of a jam. I definitely recommend The First Counsel over this book.	2003-08-14

In Dangerous Fortune, Night over Water and Pillars of the Earth, Follett takes the reader on a journey into the past with different cultures and different customs.  His characterization makes each period come alive.<br />The Third Twin is different in that it is set in the present day.  It is a traditional, sub-par thriller that is made worse by Follett's political bias or ignorance.  I'll mention more on that later.  Jeannie Ferrami studies identical twins and her studies leads her to some facts that some certain bad guys don't want to be discovered.  Ferrami and one of her subjects race against the three bad guys to expose the bad guys for the evil people that they are.<br />It is true that they were evil, but Follett does a horrible job of making me fear this people or making me think they are worthy bad guys.  In the beginning of the book, Follett says Senator Proust has photos of himself with Rush Limbaugh, Geraldo Riveria and Newt Gingrich.  Later a reference is made to Barry Goldwater as a hero to one of the bad guys. The bad guys are also mentioned to be in favor of gun control.  Now, to a liberal, these aren't ideal beliefs, but they hardly make a person evil.  Yet, Follett fails to do anything else to characterize the bad guys as evil.<br />So we are supposed to believe they are bad because they are Republican.<br />Also, the three bad guys are involved in cloning and genetic engineering.  To me, Follett implies that this is a right-wing issue and that only conservatives would use genetics to create the type of humans they want.  This book was several years old, but as far as I can tell, this is a political neutral issue.  There are wackos on both sides willing to use genetics to engineer humans.<br />I don't know if Follett is a bigot against conservatives or just naïve to think that throwing in some liberal buzzwords would be all he would need to do to create the sense that the bad guys truly are bad in this novel.<br />Politics aside, this story was interesting yet I found much of the dialogue between characters both childish and stating the obvious.  I never felt like Ferrami those helping her were fighting to stop something truly evil.  Maybe that is because the main plan they were trying to stop was the sale of a genetics firm in which Senator Proust would get $60 million to run for president.  Follett himself makes this implausible by making Proust such an unlikeable character.  Also, selling a firm for money doesn't just lead to being president.  So I never really feel like the unlikeable Proust will get the power that he wants.<br />I plan on reading more Follett but will stick to the period pieces and WWII stuff.t the bad guys truly are bad in this novel.<br />Politics aside, this story was interesting yet I found much of the dialogue between characters both childish and stating the obvious.

As a sequel I was already well aware of the 6 kids and their abilities to fly.  So there wasn't any mystery there.  Patterson again shows skill in creating a creepy villian in Dr. Ethan Kane.  Still, the Lake House isn't a mystery, so there isn't any path of discovery in finding out the bad guys.<br />The chapters of the book concerning the life of the bird children get kind of old.  Maybe some readers like Patterson's sentimental side, but I'm not one of them.  I prefer the mystery, the violence and suspense, none of which is in the Lake House.	2003-07-08

The beginning shows promise, with the kidnapping and mystery surgery on Lou McBride.  Then Nicco Cope for no apparent reason assasinates a terminally ill old man.  Both are obviously being manipulated by an evil organization.<br />But then the next 400 pages or so switch gears and follow the plight of Dr. Jeffery Duran, Nicco's pshychologist, and Adrienne, her sister.  Duran has also been affected by this evil organization, and the reader knows it from the beginning.  But it takes 400 pages for Jeffery and Addrienne to figure out.  Then in the last few pages or so, Case tells us what the \\"Syndrome\\" is all about, then throws in some action in the climax.<br />Case's novels are getting progressivley worse.  It'll be awhile before I try his new one.	2003-06-23

Shutter Island is a phsycological thriller set over four days and with a minimum amount of characters.  Where Mystic River had a ride, rambling scope, Shutter Island focuses on US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his investigation of the mental health facility at shutter island.<br />I know if I had spent more time reading each and every word Lehane wrote, I might have figured out the ending, but Shutter Island is too quick of a read to spend too much time on.  Still, looking back, I can see how well Lehane devised the story and all of the action leads to the ending we get.<br />Lehane hopefully has a long career ahead of him.  I like is mugshot in the back of the hardcover.  It looks to me like Lehane knows that he has it made writing books for a living and getting paid to do what he enjoys.<br />This is a good book and I recommend it.	2003-05-19

After reading a Dangerous Fortune (a great book by Follett), I immediately started reading this book.  It is incredibly long and very slow at the beginning and I seriously considered scrapping the whole thing.  It took about the length of a normal novel for this book to get good, but then I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br />Follett covers about 70 years in this story of the building of a cathedral and all those involved.  There are good and bad, rich and poor, weak and strong.  Follett pulls no punches and rarely throws in twists, but manages to tell a good story.  The historical detail is very educational if at times rambling.<br />If you are a Follett Fan, then I recommend this book.  If you are considering Follett, try something shorter.  I also took a break while reading this to read the Jester by James Patterson.  That book covered the same time period, but in much less detail.	2003-05-06

We follow the Jester Hugh as he tries to lead a revolt against royalty, find true love, and preserve a religious artifact.<br />Every thing about this novel is formula driven and there are no surprises.  Even the historical detail wasn't that fascinating because it was so narrow in scope.  This story could have been set in the 21st century and it would have worked just as well (with a few modifications).  This book is more in-depth that some of Patterson's efforts and the characters aren't as dumb as Alex Cross has become.  Read this if you have the time, otherwise, don't.	2003-04-22

I thought this would be just like the Rainmaker or the Street Lawyer with Grisham taking on evil, corporate America.<br />Clay Carter does get this chance and he makes a quick fortune through dubious methods and then takes on a case that could make him millions of dollars.  At this point, the King of Torts switches gears and becomes something totally unexpected and also pretty boring and dissappointing.<br />Clay Carter started out as an underdog with a chance to change his life.  But then Clay turns into the person we all hate, the evil tort lawyer.  Grisham shows his obvious distaste for the evil greed of the bigtime tort lawyers, and that redeems this book in some fashion.  Yet the story it is trying to tell takes on more of a biographical tone of Clay Carters life.  There are no twists or turns or good guys or bad guys.  Things just happen to Clay Carter, good and bad, and we are along for the ride.<br />I didn't totally hate this book because its message is against tort lawyers and their greed, but the King of Torts is a big disappointment.

The only negative I had about this book was the ending.  I guess I expected some sort of surprise but was disappointed when the book ended logically.  But now I realize what Follet did with this novel.  Maybe if he wrote the same story now he would add a twist because those are popular now.  But he didn't and I still loved this book.<br />Dangerous Fortune tells the story of the Pilaster Bank and its fall.  Most of the characters seem to be stereotypes, forced into a role by their position in society.  But I soon realized that was how real life was in 19th century London.  Your roll in life was largely determined by your ancestors, your profession, or your title.<br />All characters acted like they were expected to, the loyal wives, the respected businessmen, the sons who were the heirs, but Follet shows us how they got around being respectful by gambling, visiting brothels, and lying and stealing.  This book is full of intrigue and lust and greed.  I liked that but I also enjoyed the educational aspect of what life was like for the upper class of England long ago.  I assume Follet knows what he is talking about.<br />I recommend this book!	2003-02-19
US	50320963	R3SMHHFI9WGFXK	0451202244	184026856	Above the Law	Books	3	1	1	N	N	This book has many flaws	My wife got me this book for Christmas so of course I read the entire thing.  Freedman is obviously a good writer but this was a pretty bad novel.<br />Luke Garrison is a prosecutor assigned to try a case of a botched DEA raid in remote Muir County, CA.  He tries the lead DEA agent for a murder and the plot goes from there.<br />Here are the problems I had with this novel.  First, it is about twice as long as it should be.  Skip the opening 30 pages.  They are like a short story that adds nothing.  Second, Garrison and his investigators interview all the witnesses, talk about what they interviewed about, question the witnesses in court, then talk about it some more.  All of the facts are repeated several times.  Also, Freedman seems to be slightly out of touch with reality.  His character names are sometimes silly, (nora, riva, a child named bucky, an Indian nanny named Joan.)  Also, who would hire a nanny in the remote Muir county when they didn't have one in busy L.A.  Someone who needed to move the plot forward I guess.<br />If you are a fan of this author, then maybe you've learned to live with the lack of quality of some of Freedman's novels.  But I'll stop with this one.	2003-02-06

I'm always excited when I read an author for the first time and decide that I will read more books by that author.  I got Night over Water for Christmas and was immediately transported to 1939 and the flight across the Atlantic on the PanAm Clipper.  Follet grabbed me with his characterization which made each page enjoyable.  The climax wrapped up a bit too nicely, but getting there was great fun.	2003-01-20

Like in Darkness Take My Hand (the best in the series) Lehane does a great job of plotting and shifts the focus of the plot halfway through the book from why a woman killed herself, to who perhaps made her kill herself.<br />Lehane is a good author and I recommend everyone of his books.	2003-01-05

This one is better than his last effort which involved the ridiculous plot of Kyle Craig and the Mastermind.<br />The plot of military assassins on a killing spree is nothing special, but at least it isn't a plot involving a serial killer with a personal vendetta about Alex Cross.<br />Patterson again chooses to focus on characters instead of plot details.  You can skip the chapters about Nana if you want because they add nothing to the plot.  Patterson writes about Cross spending hours doing research about the killings but he never lets the reader know what Cross discovers.  Nor are we allowed to know how Cross found out who the final killer was.  This isn't so bad if you don't mind missing tons of details and reading a short, exciting book.<br />After so many novels, I know what to expect from Patterson and Four Blind Mice doesn't dissapoint.  However, after so many Cross novels, the chapters about family and friends seem to be there just to fill up space.	2002-12-11

There are almost too many twists and turns.  The main character Estes suspects everyone and she should because there aren't really any nice characters in the novel.  There is no one to care for, and the numerous twists and turns never allow the reader to settle into a comfort level.<br />This novel is set in the horsing world which really isn't that exciting.  This is Hoag's worst novel that I've read, and I've read around five or so.	2002-12-07

Cold Case has an exiting plot and colorful characters and plenty of twists and turns, yet author Stephen White manages to make it about as boring as possible.<br />This is my first time to read this author.  To me, there was no emotion in his writing.  I never felt for the characters.  There wasn't much action since most of the plot revolved around the lives of characters and the revealing of long buried secrets.  Still, White couldn't even make the personal lives of the characters exciting.<br />White also made the mistake that I've seen a lot in movies but not really in books.  White is obviously a liberal based on his writing.  In Cold Case, there is a congressman and his chief of staff who we are supposed to think are bad guys (maybe they are, maybe they aren't, I won't say.)  But one of the characteristics he gives them is being pro gun control and fans of Rush Limbaugh.  Because of those traits, we are supposed to side with Dr. Alan Gregory and not like those two people.  It is so shallow to for an author do something like that.  It is obvious that White doesn't understand why conservatives believe what they believe.<br />Still, that shallow characterization didn't bother me that much.  The book just seemed to lack passion.  I probably won't read another.  I will say that I enjoyed the fact there wasn't tons of sex and bad language in this book.  That was nice for a change to read about characters that didn't swear every other word.	2002-11-11

It had plenty of twists and turns and violence.  But I was frustrated because after reading the synopsis on the jacket of the hardcover, and the 3-page prologue about someone in Port Mesa, Texas, I guessed the plot.<br />I usually don't try and guess plots, but this one just came to me.  Only so many things can happen to kids when they are kidnapped.  Lehane telegraphs his plot in an obvious manner.  Skip the first three pages and you'll probably not guess the plot.  Still, I enjoyed this novel.  Lehane is a great writer and obviously invests a lot of effort into his entertaining novels.<br />Prayers for Rain is next on my list.	2002-10-23
US	50320963	R2ZW9QEMML3N2S	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	1	5	6	N	N	This book is horrible and I'll tell you why	Tom Clancy is a pretty good writer.  He is excellent at plotting but only average at characterization.  Clancy's best books have been ones that covered worldwide plots and many angles of deception and violence.  Red Rabbit is similar to some of John Grisham's latest works.  The author hasn't changed, but the subject matter is extremely boring or simple.<br />The jacket to Red Rabbit makes it sound like the defection of a KGB officer leads to a world-wide conflict.  In reality, Red Rabbit is only about getting an defector out of the USSR.  Then, the last 50 or so pages, some action is thrown in and the US and British try to stop an assasination attempt on the pope.<br />In usual Clancy fashion, he skips around from story line to story line.  But in this book, very few of the story lines are interesting.  Clancy repeats himself in several cases by offering repetitive views of the homelife of the Ryans (ride to work, nanny, baby sleeping, Sally watching TV, British food, Cathy and the British medical industry) and the Foleys (kid watches Transformers, Mary Pat is pretending to be a dumb blonde, etc.)  Half of this stuff doesn't matter one bit.  But Clancy seems intent on not leaving out even one minute detail of the lives of these characters.  Also, many references are repeated such as Jack being a knight, and agents being called spooks.  With a good author, you wouldn't notice these things or wouldn't be annoyed by them.<br />To put it simply, this book has about enough drama, action and suspense to be a 200 page story. Instead it goes on for 600 pages.  That right there tells you that 400 pages are filled with meaningless drivel.<br />Clancy hits at the end that there will be a sequal based on the fall of the USSR.  Hopefully it will be full of more action, and less stereotypical characterization.	2002-10-10

James Dobson is obviously a Christian and he shares that many times in this book.  Also a lot of his parenting advice comes from a Christian point of view.  If you are a Christian then this won't bother you.  But if you are not a Christian I encourage you to read this book anyway.<br />Almost all the advice Dr. Dobson offers is sound and good and can be trusted.  If you are turned off by his preaching, then skip those parts.  But this book will help you raise a good, solid boy regardless of your religious beliefs.	2002-09-30

In the forward to this book, Greg Iles comments that he has written many types of books and thanks his fans for allowing him to do so.  Sleep No More is a completely different book than all of his others yet it is similar in many ways.  This book contains many elements that were found in the Quiet Game and Mortal Fear.<br />The main character John Waters has a seemingly happy life with a wife and a littel girl.  Eve Summers enters his life uttering phrases and doing things that an old lover named Mallory Candler used to do, and Mallory has been dead for 10 years.  Waters' relationship with Mallory is very much alive and plays a huge role in the novel.  Making sense of tragic secrets of the past is the only way John Waters can survive the present.<br />Sleep No More is totally different novel for Iles because it has a supernatural element.  I'm sure that's why Stephen King was given two quotes on the covers praising the book.  Iles is a good enough writer that he doesn't have to compare his work to anyone, yet when combining genres, it helps to have the support of someone like Stephen King.<br />If you can except that what Iles proposes can actually happen, then you'll be captivated by this novel.  Everything else about this novel is excellent.  Suspense, sex, violence, drama, betrayal.  Its all there.  Iles definitely is improving as a writer and I hope he continues to try different types of novels.	2002-09-06

It took me three weeks to plow through this slow, meandering thrillless thriller.<br />Gore Yoshida, the man with the red tattoo, is planning to unleash a biological attack of the West Nile virus against the western world and leaders at the G8 summitt.  Bond is sent to Japan where he investigates the death of a British citizen and his Japanese family.<br />I'll now run through the problems I've had with this book.  Benson is not a good enough author to include details of fact with the story.  Instead he separates the two.  Benson will devote several paragraphs describing scenery or Japanese culture or the biology of mosquitoes.  Then he will get back to the action.  Good authors incorporate the description with the story so the reader isn't bored by mundane details.<br />Second, the Japanese culture is a big problem.  Benson is obviously proud of all the things he learned about Japan, and he lets us know everything he knows.  Probably one hundred times, Benson describes something using the Japanase term, then uses a sentence to say what it means in English.  This gets to be boring.  Other authors can write about foreign cultures without making them as exciting as a textbook.<br />The plot itself wasn't that exciting.  Bond made many stupid comments instead of the usual wit.  Also, Benson makes a big point of telling us about Mauimi (sp) Mcmahon, a twenty year old prostitute.  Bond comments on how young she is and refers to her as a little girl many times.  Then by the end, Bond is sleeping with her.  Fifty year old Bond sleeping with a twenty year old.  Not that big a deal except Benson made the point that Bond looked at her as a little girl, not a potential lover.<br />Another thing that bugged me is the British spelling (I guess its British) of all these words.  Can't their be two versions of one novel?<br />I don't know why this book grated on me so much.  I've enjoyed most of all of Benson's novels.  This one just lacked in so many areas.me so much.

I've read both books included here, The Final Judgment and Degree of Guilt.  Both books are good, entertaining, legal thrillers.  Patterson is a good author (although a bit liberal for my tastes), and I've enjoyed all his books.<br />But I can't understand the reason behind this two volume selection.  Why is \\"Final Judgment\\" included.  This was just released recently as the CAROLINE MASTERS paperback which was relased before that as FINAL JUDGMENT.  It all seems deceptive to me.  Patterson could have chosen another novel to include that wasn't already the subject of a con job to the public.  How many ways can one book be marketed.  First they change its title, then they release it in different form with the original title... I am losing respect for Patterson because of this deceiptful marketing.	2002-08-22

I'm not a fan of the horror genre and I've only read 5 or 6 King books.  But I've enjoyed them all and think King is a great writer, one of the best I've read.<br />His short story collection has both pros and cons.  If a story doesn't sound interesting, you can skip it.  I skipped two in this collection because they just didn't interest me.  King proves he has a vivid imagination with this collection yet some stories began to run together when they are all based in Maine.<br />King isn't a writer who has a big climax at the end of his stories or novels.  He excels at giving the reader a great story and characters over several 100 pages.  In these short stories, King doesn't have the time to develop plot and characters and this since the climaxes aren't surprises or twists, some of his short stories end with a whimper.<br />Still, I enjoyed this collection because I was able to finish each story in a short amount of time and move onto the next one.	2002-08-05

The title of the book and the summary on the jacket lead me to believe this story would revolve around a religious cult.  But it doesn't at all.  Patrick and Angie don't know who to trust as they follow lead after lead looking for Desiree, the daughter.<br />This entertaining book has plenty of twists.  It seems to be sort of a let up from the last one where the case invaded the personal lives of the two detectives.  Some of this story almost plays out like a comedy, and it lacks the gritty realism that made Lehane's last book so enjoyable.<br />After four Lehane novels, I have to admit he is a good author and I plan on reading his last two soon.	2002-07-12

To me, the co-author neither adds or detracts from the story.  I couldn't tell either way where this De Jonge guy contributed.  Patterson has such a great reputation that from previous quality work that it is hard to judge the Beach House alone on its merits.<br />Barry and Campion Neubarger are mega rich snobs who live on the Hamptons and are used to getting their way.  When Peter Mullen is killed at their house at a party, Jack Mullen tries to get to the bottom of the death, which is first ruled a suicide.  The story is predictible in that the Neubaurs use their money and power to intimadate witnesses and buy justice.<br />The story is a fast read and entertaining and the plot is somewhat predictable.  I greeted each new plot twist with a \\"that makes sense\\" acceptance.  Even the \\"stunning\\" trial at the end is rather lame.<br />The characters seem to be cardboard cutouts with Patterson throwing in details (like Pauline's tattoo of the Chrysler building on her arm) to add a personal touch.  Maybe I'm wrong, but Patterson wasted a good opportunity that could have added a lot to the plot and characters of the story.<br />At the beginning, Jack is dating Neubauer's daughter Dana.  Patterson has Jack, who is the narrator, in glowing terms and you really feel that Jack and Dana have something and their relationship could possibly last.  Then when Jack's brother is found dead, Dana is their to console Jack a few times then basically she just disappears.  Dana appears a few more times and Patterson hits that Dana was being forced to leave Jack because of her father, but Patterson never explores this possibility.  Patterson also hints at Dana being abused and being part of the problems that killed Peter.  But again he never finishes these thoughts.  I don't know if it was missed because of the 2 authors or what, but as with most of Patterson's recent novels, he goes easy on the details.<br />Beach House would have been better if Dana and Jack had stayed together while at the same time Jack tried to prove Dana's family was involved with Peter's death.  This would have added depth to Jack.  Instead we are left with the rich versus poor conflict to hang our hat on.<br />All the above details about Dana are not spoilers because Patterson drops Dana early in the book as a character after making the reader care about her early on.  I hoped she would be mentioned again and her role clarified but it never was.<br />So, Beach House is a good book that could have been better.  It seems like that's the case with most of Patterson's efforts lately.each House would have been better if Dana and Jack had stayed together while at the same time Jack tried to prove Dana's family was involved with Peter's death.

Probably only 5-10% of the books I read are ones where I make extra time to read because I can't put it down.  This is one of those books.  The plot revolves around a serial killer and P.I.s Patrick and Angie.<br />The cool think about this book is that the serial killer element isn't introduced for 100 pages or so.  Most novels introduce all their characters early in a story, but it shows Lehane's strength as a writer when he introduces new characters about 1/3 through the novel and the story continues to flow.<br />Then Lehane leads us along a thrilling ride full of twists and turns that end up involving characters that all knew each other in some fashion.  This book is a lot like James Patterson in that there is a killer who has a personal vendetta against the main characters.  Lehane keeps his mystery focused on a group of people who somehow knew each other, and the story doesn't seem far fetched.<br />There is a lot of violence and a lot of twists.  Some authors reveal twists slowly and you wonder the police or FBI hadn't figured it out sooner.  This happens all the time in James Patterson stories.  Lehane lets the characters discover the truth in a natural progression.  The twists don't seem forced.<br />Lehane actually takes the time to support the twists in the story.<br />Darkness, Take my Hand is full of gritty violence and a lot of bad things happen to a lot of people.  Somehow Patrick and Angie survive it all and even come out on top in the end, although not without some sacrifice on their parts.	2002-06-24
US	50320963	R17Y06TZKPUCVR	0451185196	745684315	Black Cross	Books	5	69	73	N	N	Thrilling and chilling	I've now read all of Greg Iles' books, and Black Cross just might be his best.  Black Cross, along with Spandau Phoenix, are unlike his more recent efforts in that they relate to WWII and mix actual history with fiction to come up with an exciting story that could actually be true.<br /> Black Cross is the story of an American pacifist Dr. Mark McConnel and a Jewish soldier Jonas Stern who are sent to Germany to make the Germans believe the Allies have just as much poison gas as the Germans do.  This is done to convince Germany that the allies will retalliate if the Germans use gas to stop the Normandy Invasion.<br /> Black Cross stands out because Iles takes us inside a German concentration camp and lets us meet all kinds of characters.  We get to know Jewish and Polish prisoners, sympathetic German nurses, spies, and even a German officer is made to look somewhat sympathetic.  Iles portrays him as a soldier who puts up with the German brutality because he has no choice, and because it is his duty to fight for his country.<br /> Iles also bookends the book with McConnel's grandson finding out the truth about his grandfather.  So what happened in WWII isn't a secret, but is tied to the present.  Therefore while reading, we want to know how everything turns out but you want to know what happened to these characters for the rest of their life.  The conclusions aren't breathtaking or startling, but they are satisfying.<br /> I do think Black Cross might have been a bit two long.  The ending seems to go one and on until the mission is accomplished.  Also some of the logistics of the plan seemed a bit far fetched.  Like what were the German guards in the tower doing when all this was happening.  But these are minor problems in what is a great novel.  Maybe in the future Iles will return to this genre.	2002-06-17

Mystic River was an enthralling character study and A Drink Before the War is an action filled detective story.  Both are quite different yet both are riveting thrillers.<br />A Drink Before the War centers around a gang war, child abuse and state politics.  There are a lot of shootouts and a lot of twists and turns and mysteries to uncover.  I was surprised this book held up under the scrutiny of having read Lehane's latest quality work.  But it did and I will continue to read the series.	2002-05-31

Dave was kidnapped by child molesters and managed to escape.  Now, the kids are all grown up.  Sean is a cop, Jimmy was a criminal who has gone straight, and Dave is married with a child, but still struggles with his past.  Jimmy's daughter Katie is violently murdered and Dave came home the same night covered in blood.  Sean gets to try and solve the case.<br />That is the plot in a nutshell and can basically be learned by reading the jacket of the book or the Amazon review or the first 100 pages or so.  So I thought I had the plot figured out, but Lehane takes us deeper into this world where each character has strong personalities and flaws.  Mystic River doesn't really have any plot twists or turns.  Instead, Lehane reveals a little bit more to us as Sean and his cop buddies find out the information themselves.  If the cops had known some things sooner, the ending might have been different.<br />Mystic River is a strong book because of the characterization.  Still, at the beginning I had myself trying hard to find someone to root for.  In the end, there are really no good guys to care about, but the story is still exciting.<br />I did have one complaint.  Lehane does a great job of portraying the horrible world these people live in.  It is full of guns, drugs, alcohol, abuse, poverty and neglect.  Then when Sean solves a crime at the end, Lehane pawns off blame on a totally unrelated part of society.  It seems Lehane ignores what he had written the entire novle.  The abuse, neglect, alcohol, crime, drugs and poverty were what shaped the criminal's behavior, not the cause he gives.<br />Anyway, I enjoyed this novel and had never read Lehane before.  I'm now starting A Drink Before the War, his first novel, and hope to read the rest if they are close to as good as Mystic River.	2002-05-20

Dead Even is worse in every respect and I would not recommend it.  I loved The First Counsel, but Dead Even has none of the suspense or intrigue that made The First Counsel so exciting.<br />Jared is the defense attorney and Sara is the DA on a burgerly case that soon turns into big trouble for the husband and wife.  Both are threatened with a win or your spouse dies proposition.  Quite an intriguing plot, but it seems Meltzer struggled finding circumstances that would result in that plot twist.  It seems like all of the bad guys exist in this book solely to mess up Sara and Jared.  It seems like Meltzer forces the action.<br />The book is chugging along, being mildly entertaining, when suddenly it starts being incredibly exciting for a few pages.  Sara and Jared are trying to win their cases to save the other, but at the same time they can't tell each other what they are doing.  This leads to them growing apart and possibly becoming attracted to other people.  Before, I had never felt like there marriage was in danger from the bad guys, but when Jared and Sara's own feelings started going in other directions and kisses and allegations of affairs started flying, I really felt interested in their fate.  Would Sara and Jared's marriage be destroyed, not by the somewhat comical bad guys, but by their own mistrust for each other?<br />Unfortanatley, Meltzer wastes this intrigue and suspense by immediately switching gears and having Sara and Jared resolve their conflict.  Then from that point on, the book fizzles out into a boring conclusion.<br />Dead Even was boring because it didn't have a gripping, exciting background like the White House.  Just two lawyers caught in a contrived situation.  Also, Meltzer's dialogue can get somewhat old.  Does everyone have to be a comedian?	2002-05-03
US	50320963	RCU0QCY8ERYZH	0684863618	682610760	Pale Horse Coming	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A thrilling thriller!	Pale Horse Coming is a great Stephen Hunter novel, just like all others in the Swagger series.  This one features Earl Swagger, just like his last one, Hot Springs.  But Pale Horse Coming is better.  From the jacket, you know the general plot of Earl destroying a prison.  The first few pages had me hooked as the town and prison of Thebes is established to be an evil, mysterious place, and Earl's friend Sam agrees to go there to find a missing person.<br />The action picks up when Sam is arrested and Earl goes to find him.  The rest of the plot is pretty straight forward without any surprising twists, but that doesn't mean there isn't any suspense.  There are a few slow parts in the book, and those include Sam trying to find out the history of Thebes including all of its deep dark secrets.  Some of this seems drawn out and predictible, yet not enough to slow the story down.  The best parts were the scenes at the prison, where evil truly existed.  Those parts made the climax that much greater, when you had a true sense of the evil Earl and his friends were fighting.<br />Now for a few random thoughts.  Stephen Hunter isn't a racist, but in writing a period piece with racism as the primary force of evil, there are parts that are bound to be uncomfortable.  So, any black person should be aware of the brutal treatment of the black prisioners and the frequent use of racial slurs.  Perhaps the worst part is realizing that attitudes like this did exist, and perhaps still do.<br />Reading Amazon reviews is the only way I found out that all of the characters on Earl's posse were real-life gunmen.  However, the name Audie Ryan did ring a bell.  Just like in Hot Springs, Hunter used realife characters.  I don't think it detracted from the story, because in this book, I had never heard of them.<br />In the climactic battle, Hunter writes with the belief that if you are a good gunman, you can defeat several people with your precise shooting alone.  I think Hunter gives a good shooter too much credit.  Other men with guns would probably get in a few kills now and then.<br />Finally, this is the fifth book in the Swagger series I believe, and the one that relates best to it is Black Light.  In that book, Earl's son Bob Lee tries to figure out the mystery of his father's death.  I know Hunter wrote Black Light several years ago.  But if I remember right, Earl was killed rather easily considering the mayhem and death he survived in this book and Hot Springs.  The Earl Swagger in this book would not have died so easily in Black Light.  I may reread Black Light to see if my memory is correct.<br />I recommend all books in the Swagger series to anyone who enjoys Pale Horse Coming.oter too much credit.

Coonts tried to apply the political/military formula for a thriller that worked so well in his last book, Cuba, and he fails to produce an inspiring or exciting story.<br />Jake Grafton's wife is kidnapped by Hong Kong hoodlums right in the middle of a Chinese civil war.  A lot of the novel is about the characters involved in the civil war, yet that isn't the focus of the book.  So that means that the parts about the civil war aren't that satisfying.  There is no conclusion to that part and you don't care about those characters.  Even the bad guy that takes Grafton's wife is really a minor character, and when she is saved, it seems just like a minor point compared to the epic struggle of a civil war in China.<br />Hong Kong is not a good book because Coonts hints at a wide-spread regional conflict with many involved characters, then abandons them at the end to focus on Grafton.<br />Also, the first part of the book in which the civil war was set up seemed liking nothing more than an anti communist rant.  I hate communism just as much as the next American, but I don't need to be preached to by a novel about it.  I can safely assume that most readers already agree that China's government is bad and should be replaced.<br />While Coonts provides entertaining novels, he still isn't as good as Clancy or the old Larry Bond books.	2002-04-08
US	50320963	R2UXYYV7JM1W4Z	0316693200	309666534	2nd Chance	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Great murder mystery, but characterization is bad	2nd Chance is James Patterson's best effort in awhile. A serial killer is killing black people and Lindey Boxer thinks she is dealing with a hate crime. Soon. Lindey and her Women's murder club realize there may be more to the killings than they realized. The murders and the clues add up and Boxer finally settles on a suspect only to realize there's a lot more to the killings than she realizes.<br />While I enjoyed the murder mystery, it came real close to becoming extremely ridiculous. Patterson's last book, Violets are Blue, contains one of the worst, most contrived plots in the history of storytelling. Patterson has the habit of making every serial killer's motives a personal vendetta against Alex Cross. For awhile, I thought the killer in 2nd Chance was going to be doing his killing just to get back at Boxer, and it would be another rehash of a tired old plot. The killer's motives are somewhat personal against Boxer, but remain just far enough away from being just agains Boxer that I can tolerate the story.<br />2nd Chance is good because most of it is devoted to the murder mystery, and less time is devoted to the social lives of the characters. This is good because Patterson must be one of the worst writers around at characterization and relationships among characters. It is obvious that in Patterson's own personal life, he likes fine wine, fine gormet foods, literature (not fiction) and foreign films. In other words, the types of things the vast of majority of Americans enjoy such as beer and soda, cheeseburgers and pizza, John Grisham, and action movies don't appeal to Patterson. It's like he looks down on people who enjoys those things and it shows in his writing. Every single one of the the women's club members all read literature and cook only gourmet foods. It seems like Patterson is trying to set them apart by throwing in references to these obscure cultural references, and in doing so, all the characters blend together and sound the same.<br />I'll give one example from 2nd Chance. There is a pastor from a inner city church named Aaron Winslow. He and Cindy Thomas of the club begin to date. Cindy is surprised to find out that Winslow has read the Bonesetter's Daughter and some book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. I don't know which is worse, that an inner city pastor reads those books, or that a reporter for a newspaper exresses surprise that he does. Then on a date they go to a bar and listen to blues and jazz music and see the movie \\"Chocolat\\". It seems even inner city pastors have elite tastes in Patterson's world.<br />Also, Patterson has no idea about what pastors do. They believe in God. I found it quite funny when Winslow was giving a sermon about how hard someone worked and what a great person they were, Lindsey and Cindy were moved to tears at the \\"chilling, moving words\\" of Winslow. Patterson said Winslow was a great speaker then gave him mundane words to speak. Also at a eulogy, Winslow talked of service and loving one another and being kind, as if those traits were what he worshiped. Never once did Winslow mention God. Quite odd for a pastor who goes through a lot in this story. Also, Patterson implied that after one of the dates of blues, bars and foreign films, Cindy and Winslow slept together.<br />Patterson needs to stick to murder and mystery. He has no idea about real lives of real people.one example from 2nd Chance. There is a pastor from a inner city church named Aaron Winslow. He and Cindy Thomas of the club begin to date.

I read it about 3 months ago and am still amazed that the bad feelings I have for Violets are Blue are still so strong.<br />Vampires are on the loose and are killing people across the country.  Cross follows them everywhere.  There are plenty of twists but no turns.  A lot of stuff happens, and Cross and Co. never can figure out why.  But the problem is, Patterson never reveals to the reader any reason to care about the vampire killings.  Two things amazed me:  how inept the police were in finding the killers, and how Patterson came up with this convoluted crazy stupid plot.<br />Then there is the whole mastermind fiasco.  The mastermind is the villian from the book Roses are Red.  After reading that, you know who the Mastermind is, so throughout this book, the reader is left to wonder when Cross will find out who it is.  Then in the last several pages, Patterson throws in what he probably thought was a clever plot point about the mastermind in tying him to several other crimes, but its not clever if it's not explained.  I was left just shaking my head.  It would have been cool if it had made sense or been feasible or possible.  But what Patterson described was both impossible and ridiculous.<br />I guess in Patterson's world, all serial killers operate with a personal vendetta against Cross.  That seems to be the plot in every book.<br />Patterson is a great writer.  I enjoyed 2nd Chance much more than this book.  He just needs to work on his plots a little more.	2002-03-25

He's churned out a disappointing novel only because he sets his sights so low.  Ray Atlee returns home because his father has summoned Ray and his brother Forrest home for a reading of the will.  Ray arrives and finds his father is dead.  Ray also finds $3 million in cash.  Where did the money come from?  That is the plot and the conflict.<br />Ray takes the money and decides to hide it from his brother and from the probate courts.  Then Ray tries to find how his father could have gotten that much money.  This chase is pointless because none of it has to do with anything about the plot.  Only in the last 70 pages or so does Grisham throw in a revelation about where the money cames from.  The previous searches by Ray have nothing to do in leading him to the source of the money.  Because Grisham is such a good writer, those sections are entertaining, but they end up being meaningless and add little to the overall story.<br />The problem with the Summons is that it is so simple.  Man finds money.  Man tries to find where money came from.  That's the plot.  Grisham has deliberately chosen a simple plot revolving around a few characters.  There is only so much he can do with the story to make it exciting.  I wish Grisham would expand his reach and combine several different story arcs and characters in one exciting novel.  He did this with A Painted House and most of his earlier novels.<br />Be careful what reviews you read because I read one on Amazon that gave away the source of the money.  It was kind of frustrating to already know that.  Also, some reviewers complain about the ending and that it was just thrown together.  I don't believe so.  The Summons had n incredibly simple plot that was told from one person's point of view and really had only 2 other main characters.  Such a simple story deserves a simple ending.<br />I hope next time Grisham writes a book twice as long as this with his amazing characterization along with Tom Clancy-like plot and detail.  That would truly be a masterpiece.lancy-like plot and detail.  That would truly be a masterpiece.	2002-03-04

Numbered Accounts is a long book that definitely requires an investment on the part of the reader.  The book is similar to a Tom Clancy novel in that you get flooded with details on how the Swiss banking system works.  If you don't mind that, then you will enjoy the detail.  Still, the book seemed to be about 100 pages too long.<br />Nick Newman goes to work with United Swiss Bank to find out why his father was killed.  Then you throw in a terrorist using the bank money to buy a nuclear weapon and a takeover attempt by a rival bank, and you have the plot in a nutshell.  I honestly considered quitting reading this book around page 250, but then the action picked up.<br />Author Christopher Reich takes his time in revealing the motivation, fault and crimes of the characters.  As he slowly reveals more, I became drawn into Nick's fate.  Nick finds himself in an incredibly complex situation and has to fight his way out of it using both brains and force.<br />This book is a business thriller and so the love interest with Sylvia Schon wasn't that interesting.  I skipped over most of those parts.  A previous reviewer said he felt cheated by Riech's treatment of this relationship.  I didn't because I had my suspicious about her from the beginning.  Reich could have perhaps made more of Nick's relationship with Anna, although he does give glimpses of the depth of their relationship.<br />The plot twists are pretty straightforward and the action is exciting.  Perhaps one weakness is that the villian Mevlevi is introduced quite late in the book and it takes awhile to care about the scenes he is in.<br />Overall this is good book with average characters, but a highly detailed plot.  A must read for those interested in the financial thriller genre.	2002-02-20

This is the first Meltzer book I've read, and as is usually the case, the first book by an author is usually my favorite since you don't have any clue as to how the author writes or where he is going with the story.<br />This book truly was a page turner and very easy to read.  Instead of telling us, Meltzer uses a lot of dialogue to keep the story moving quickly.  Authors like James Patterson are easy to read but his novels are so short.  When I read Scott Turow, just a few pages wore me out.  The First Counsel is full of twists and turns and substance and easy to read 60 to 70 pages at a time.<br />The opening chapter had me hooked.  White House lawyer Michael Garrick is dating the president's daughter Nora.  They elude the secret service and see Garrick's boss Edgar Simon at a gay bar.  Simon then drives out into the forest to make a drop of $40,000.  Nora and Michael go exploring and Nora takes some of the money.  From there a murder is committed and the evidence keeps mounting against Michael.<br />I enjoyed this book so much because most of the action revolved around the White House, which seemed very intriguing to me.  The First Daugher Nora was also a great character.  She just wanted to live a normal life but had so many flaws.  As the book draws to an end, we have to see if Michael can figure out who is trying to frame him and keep from getting killed.  We also have to see how Michael and Nora's relationship worked out.  I admit that I liked this book because the idea of dating the president's daughter seemed cool to me.  The idea of any kind of outsider having access to the White House is intriguing.<br />This is one of those books where getting to the end is half the fun.  Meltzer takes the reader on a great ride.  The climax is believable and exciting and well written.  It has a few twists and also sheds some doubt onto Nora's character and all of her previous actions.  I just finished reading the book a few minutes ago, so I haven't yet decided yet what kind of person Nora truly is.  Is she a sympathetic victim or an evil manipulator, or both?<br />I've read a few reviews that have criticized this book.  Maybe Meltzer's other books aren't as good as this one, but I'm definitely going to read them.  I was surprised at how much I became involved with the outcome of the story.<br />I recommend this book to anyone.shed reading the book a few minutes ago, so I haven't yet decided yet what kind of person Nora truly is.

This book is a classic and hilarious.<br />My favorite parts were the early 1900's and up to about WWII.

Of course back then you weren't considered a racist if you held some of those beliefs, but times have changed. The Onion has a hold on what public consensus was during the past and uses that knowledge to create hilarious stories.<br />I recommend this book for anyone with a knowledge of history or for anyone wanting to learn.	2002-01-22

In the first part, Iles introduces the conflict.  Famed photographer Jordan Glass sees a painting of her missing twin sister.  She discovers that this painting may be one in a series of several paintings of missing dead women.  Jordan hooks up with the FBI and they do a few interviews.  We find out Jordans father has been missing and presumed dead for several years.  Also, Jordan got a call from someone claiming to be her sister and now Jordan retains some hope that her sister may be alive.<br />Then the book hits a snag.  Based on an investigation of the Sleeping Women paintings, the FBI narrows the list of supsects to four.  The next 100 pages or so constists of the FBI and Jordan interviewing the suspects, and then interviewing them again.<br />Then the book ends with one of the supects kidnapping Jordan and beginning to paint her. Then the plot twist happens and the book is over.<br />This is Iles first time writing as a woman and I think that may have hurt the book although I can't say how.  I have a bigger problem with the character Marcel de Beque.  See if you can understand his motives for what he did and why?  I sure couldn't.<br />Iles throws in the obligatory sexual relationship between Jordan and FBI agent Kaiser.  Some of this seemed force and wasn't necessary to the story.  The Quiet Game was good in that it didn't force the sex between the two romantic interests.<br />While this book is always interesting, it is just a step down from his previous efforts.  Iles isn't like some authors who quit trying after initial success (ie Grisham or James Patterson).  Dead Sleep just didn't hit its mark with me.	2002-01-15

Violets are Blue is no different than the last few Alex Cross novels. It is an exciting page turner with thrills and chills but needs so much work to compare with Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider.<br />Patterson is obviously a great writer. He shows the talent in this story, creating truly evil characters who committ horrible crimes and keeping me turning the pages wanting to find out if they were going to be caught. Patterson definitely has the skills to keep the reader entertained and on the edge of his seat, but he also leaves you with so many questions.  Many times I read a book and have questions about the plot, but usually the author gives you the answers in the story, you just have to look.  I have so many questions about Violets are Blue, but none of them are answered in the story.<br />This novel has two storylines:  murderous vampires on the loose and the Mastermind from the last novel.  The vampire cult is the main case the Cross travels throughout the country trying to solve.  The Mastermind is always there, always on Cross's mind, and always part of the story.<br />William and Michael are two killers travelling throughout the country killing people and drinking their blood.  Cross and the FBI are hot on their tail, arriving at each murder scene and analyzing it to death.  This is Patterson's weakness.  Cross is basically an idiot.  Cross never discovers or deduces anything.  At each crime scene Cross asks questions like \\"what are the killers trying to tell us?\\" and \\"what are their reasons?\\".  But Cross and the police never discover any clues or solve any mysteries.  A good author would allow Cross to make a discovery that makes the reader think he has accomplished something, then throw in plot twist.  But here it is just murder after murder after murder.  Also, it seems like Cross spends hours upon hours \\"jotting down notes\\" or \\"working on the computer\\".  What kind of notes are these.  Obviously not notes geared to solve the case.  It appears Cross may be on to something, and he jots down notes and questions, but the reader never sees them and therefore there is no suspense.<br />The vampire killers comment on how their is a method to their killing and it is leading to a purpose.  See if you can figure it out.  At first I couldn't but now I think I did, and boy what a let down.  Cross never figures it out either.<br />Then there is the Mastermind.  If you read Roses are Red, you know who it is.  Throughout the novel, Cross notices suspicious things about the Mastermind, but never really acts on them.  Then at the climax it all makes sense to Cross.  But it never made since to me.  <br />Patterson covers this plotline from Cross and the Mastermind's point of view.  It seems the Mastermind has always been out to get Cross, and his actions have been going on through quite a few Cross novels.  The Mastermind reveals and Cross discovers that the Mastermind has been committing murders for years and has even been in cohorts with some bad guys from some other novels.  This isn't a spoiler because this is just stated as fact.  There is no moment of revelation or discovery.  Patterson just comes right out and says it.  It's like Patterson is jus treading on the surface with this novel.  There is so much more to be seen, to be revealed, to be discovered.  Patterson prefers to keep it a secret, or as I believe, he doesn't even know its there.<br />Patterson is a good thriller writer who could use a lot of work on the supsense part.  He starts out with vampires with grand schemes of killing.  But what are the schemes.  No one ever discovers them.  The mastermind has been committing murders for years and after Cross for years.  But why, how, when, where?  This book needs a lot more detail to be satisfying.	2002-01-10

This short little novel is also well written, humourous and entertaining.<br />Every neighborhood has a family who decorates their house for Christmas in every way possible.  They put up lights and statues and snowmen and everything else.  In Skipping Christmas, those people all move into one neighborhood.  This book is a satire.  Each family in the neighborhood represents a slightly different trait in looking at Christmas.  Luther and Nora Krank represent the desire to not have to participate in all of the meaningless nonsense of parties and cards and decorating.  The novel concludes with a tidy little episode that doesn't quite warm the heart, but does bring a smile to the face.<br />...It is only 177 pages (small pages) and can easily be read in afternoon...<br />...this could have gone directly to movie form, which is obviously what it is geared to.  As mentioned earlier, there are no real characters in the story.  Every single person is a stereotype, from the cops collecting for charity to the office Christmas parties to the boy scouts selling Christmas trees.  Visually, this would make a great movie because there are many comedic moments, but for a novel it is too lightweight.<br />Also, the ending isn't original.  It reminds me of the movie Funny Farm.  While a lot of ideas are borrowed or shared, the ending also is very predictable.  There was really no other way out of the jam Luther and Nora got themselves in.<br />I'm glad I read Skipping Christmas.  It entertained me for a few hours.  I'm also glad I checked it out from the Library instead of buying it.  If I'm going to buy a novel, I want it to last awhile.	2002-01-03

After reading this book, the fourth I've read by this author, I now rank him as one of my favorite.  When I first read the synopsis, this book didn't excite me.  I guess I was a little tired of the civil rights murder solved 30 years later plotline.  Now I wish I hadn't waited so long.  Iles writes another brilliant story full of twists and turns and interesting characters.<br />Penn Cage returns home after his wife has died and gets caught up in the murder of a black man from 30 years ago.  Cage believes the killer was his ex-girlfriend's father, Leo Martson.  Of course there are numerous twists and turns involving the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, and crooked cops.<br />In a story with so many twists and turns, Iles sometimes leaves out character development.  Caitlin Masters is a newspaper publisher who helps Cage.  She starts out with a bang but really is ignored at the end.  Most of the truth about the murder is revealed before the courtroom finale, leaving little to be resolved at the end.<br />This book is a lot like Mortal Fear and nothing like 24 hours.  I am about to read Dead Sleep which I am sure will be another excellent book.	2001-12-05

This is a great book and I recommend it to anybody.  But most likely all Stephen King fans have read the book, so this review is for people who are just discovering King or looking for a good book to read.  I've read five of King's books, so I am certainly not an expert on his writing.<br />Most of King's books involve horror or the supernatural or other creepy subjects, and that doesn't interest me.  But several of his books are first great fiction with just a bit of the supernatural.  The Stand falls into that category.  Even though it was written about 25 years ago, it has withstood the test of time.  The book opens with a super flu infecting the country.  We learn about this while meeting several interesting characters.  As I read, I thought about the current threat of biological warfare and it made the Stand that much more relevant.<br />King excels in breaking down a worldwide problem into a few individual stories, therefore making the story intimate enough for you to care but broad enough to understand the death and destruction going on.  Though long, I kept reading because King allows the reader to role play.  What would I do if I was the only survivor in a town that once was home to 30,000 people.  King lets you follow along as his colorful characters band together to reform a livable society called the Free Zone.<br />But of course there are the bad guys, led by the evil Randall Flagg.  Is he human, or a demon or both?  Whatever he is, he is forming his own society and you know the societies of Flagg and the Free Zone are going to have to do battle.<br />I don't think it is the primary theme of the story, but King draws heavily from the Bible to create the Stand.  The good guys are drawn to Boulder because of a angelic women named Mother Abigail who seems to be one with God.  Flagg has obvious ties with the devil and demons and has supernatural powers.  Normally, I wouldn't like this because I can't picture a story like the stand being a realistic occurrence in a world governed by the Christian God.  To me, the two don't mix.  But King, the great author that he is, makes me believe that God just might have a hand in the happenings of the Stand, and I give him credit.  It helps that he has given a framework with which to read the story.<br />I guess I read the edited version, so I'm sure I missed out on a lot.  But with a story this long, there isn't a surprise, twisting climax at the end like so many stories have today.  Instead, King ends with a natural, satisfying conclusion.<br />One more thing.  It took me 2 months to read this book.  I remember back when I was reading the parts about the flu and characters sneezing and coughing, I found myself turning when hearing someone sneeze in real life.  Did they have the super flu?  King's characters seem so real to life, that sometimes its hard to separate the two.ence in a world governed by the Christian God.  To me, the two don't mix.

Beck thinks his wife his dead, then gets a mysterious email that makes him think she is still alive.  Sounds great, and it is.  Once he receives the email, Beck begins to investigate the circumstances around his wife's death, hoping to find out whether or not to believe in the impossible, that she isn't really dead.  This part of the book is fast paced and exciting.<br />But if his wife is really alive, then what happened eight years ago when she supposedly died?  Obviously there has to have been a conflict eight years ago, and this is where the story falls apart.  First of all, the situation, which involves murder and blackmail seems contrived.  The bad guy also seems to be all powerful and have thugs working for him that can do anything, yet we get no sense of who the bad guy is.  Finally, towards the end of the novel, when what happened 8 years ago is relevant to the current story, we find out about it by the author having one of the characters tell what happened.<br />Richard North Patterson is an author who uses flashbacks effectively.  They would have helped immensley in this story.  The situation surrounding his wife's death is obviously important, yet Coben forces us not to care.	2001-10-08
US	50320963	R1H07DK3D7OL1J	0671042858	321732450	The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon	Books	2	4	6	N	N	Story is good, but still has many problems.	I must admit that I enjoyed this book, but I was only able to do so because I suspended my belief in reality and accepted King's premise.  The little girl is lost early in the book, and from there I read each page wanting to find out if and when and how she would be rescued.  The rescue at the end would be the big payoff.  The girl Trisha spent several weeks in the woods, getting bitten to death by bugs, slowly going crazy, starving and sick, but somehow she keeps moving.  Her favorite baseball player is Tom Gordon, and she listens to his games on her Walkman and talks to him to try and keep her sanity.  All of this works well, and the end is a satisfying payoff to the girl lost in the woods story.<br />But was this good for a Stephen King effort?  Sure it was, but it wasn't worthy of a novel.  Even at large print and 220 pages, this short novel seemed to drag in places and to also be repititive.  This would have been better a short story part of a larger collection.  I think King could have done better than producing this afterthought of a novel.  Other recent novels are probably 4 times longer than this one.	2001-09-12

There is a sucker born every minute and they have all bought this book. No wonder the self-help industry makes so much money. So many people think that reading a book like this will change their life when the only way to change a life is to take action, not read a book full of generic parables.<br />This book is full of advice that everyone knows, so why do they buy this book? I feel sorry for all of those who had to read this thing in a corporate or motivational environment. This book is so insulting, now you know what your management or leadership really thinks about you. They think you are an idiot. Come on, life and business isn't as hard as Dr. Spencer makes it out to be. Remember, business isn't life or death, and its not what truly matters, so quit looking for your salvation in a meaningless, overpriced book.	2001-08-31

US	50320963	R3IL4BYL3QL3PP	0451203593	897342569	24 Hours	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Highly entertaining...	Greg Iles is an excellent author even though this is not his best book. With 24 Hours, he takes the theme of kidnapping and applies a unique twist to it. Then he makes that twist about as entertaining as possible. This book doesn't have the deep plot or character development of Mortal Fear or Spandeau Phoenix, the other two Iles books I've read, but in does entertain you with non stop action and suspense.<br />The kidnappers Joe, Cheryl and Huey each pair up with a member of their target family. Iles develops three different story lines. The evil Joe is with the wife, Karen. Cheryl is with husband Will. And Huey is with Abbey. The first part of the book is carried by sexual tension between the characters. The kidnappers know sex can be a powerful weapon, and they attempt to use it to their advantage. The last half of the book devolves into a race for Will and Karen to get to their daughter before the kidnappers get their ransom money. While there isn't a lot of charcterization, I felt for Will and Karen as they struggled to find a way to live through the kidnapping with their family intact. All readers can relate in someway to the plight of possibly losing a loved one.<br />This book is being made into a movie and some reviewers gripe that the author wrote this book specifically to be made into a movie. That may be true, but I don't think that is a bad thing. As long as it is entertaining, then I don't really care what format the story is in.<br />Iles is an excellent author who is able to write entertaining stories without rehashing characters from previous novels. As far as I can tell, he is one of the few authors that does this.	2001-08-30

Patterson is one of the few authors around that can make the entire story interesting, not because you want to find out how it ends, but because you want to find out more about the characters. Each page brings you more into the lives of the characters. This book is no different. It has murders and sex and lawyers and secrets from the past.<br />I enjoy Patterson's flashbacks into a character's past that usually in some indirect way have a bearing on the outcome of the story.<br />But I have on problem with this book. THIS BOOK IS CALLED THE FINAL JUDGEMENT, NOT CAROLINE MASTERS. THIS IS NOT A NEW BOOK. IF YOU ARE A PATTERSON FAN, YOU PROBABLY READ THIS BOOK A FEW YEARS AGO. IT CAME OUT IN HARDCOVER AND PAPERBACK UNDER A DIFFERENT TITLE. WHY MUST PATTERSON RESORT TO TRICKERY AND A HORRIBLE NEW TITLE IN ORDER TO ENTICE PEOPLE TO BUY A BOOK THEY ALREADY READ. I CAN GUESS WHY. CAROLINE MASTERS WAS IN PROTECT AND DEFEND AND HE WANTED FANS OF THAT BOOK TO READ THE FINAL JUDGEMENT...	2001-08-29

John Smith is on the verge of becoming romantically involved with Sarah when he is in a tragic car accident that leaves him in a coma.  Smith wakes up 4 1/2 years later with the ability to see a person's past and future by touching them.  King does a great job of describing Smith's reentry into the world that had gone on with out him.  As King does so well, he makes us feel Smith's pain at losing the years of his life and losing Sarah to another man.<br />John Smith just wants to lead a normal life, but he still manages to use his power to help people in need.  I kept wondering where Smith's power would lead him, and that question was answered when Smith shook the hand of politician Greg Stillson.  This is where the book starts to lose its power.  Smith obviously gets a vision from shaking Stillson's hand, but King doesn't tell us the exact details of the vision.  Instead, King describes Stillson's life in every detail even though he provided plenty of characterization earlier in the book for us to already despise Stillson.<br />Once you realize what Smith plans to do, you can guess as to his motivations.  After the climax, King ties up loose ends by revealing the letters John wrote to his dad and to Sarah before the final climax occurred.<br />Sarah and Johnny put an end to their relationship in a morally questionable way yet highly understandable.  Throughout the book, King hints that Johnny's gift may be from God.  King never really finishes that line of thought, but it does make the reader think that Johnny could live with his actions knowing he was sacrificing himself for the greater good.  This is a great book except for about 40 pages that are devoted to Stillson, a character we already know enough about.	2001-08-20

There aren't any surprises, so you are left with Coontz's description of events to entertain you.  He does a good job describing the action and the CIA inflitration of CUBA.  Grafton is a minor player in this book, his only job being to monitor an attack that he is in charge of.  Still, this book is easy to read and not a total disappointment.	2001-08-06

This book completes the Union trilogy, but the Union mystique kind of just fizzles out.  The Union and le Gerant seemed much less evil in this offering.  Bond spends the book chasing after the Union, but in the previous books, we had more of a sense of his impending doom.  The bad guys are all from previous books.  The only original bad guy is more of a pawn of the union. Aside from the story, Benson is not a very good writer.  Maybe it was more prevalent in this novel that in others, But Benson uses the passive voice in writing sentences.  Instead of describing scenes, he tells us with the verb &quot;was&quot;.  I know a lot of authors do this, but Benson does it so much that it sticks out and becomes destracting.  A better writer would find a better way to describe things. Benson will never be a great writer, but as his worst effort, this book wasn't that bad.	2001-07-23

Hunter goes further back in time for a prequal to the Swagger series, and he does a pretty good job.  This book is full of all the violence, action and suspense of the previous books.  Much of the suspense (like the truth about earl's father) is anti climactic because it has no bearing on the future books in the series.<br />I won't say Hunter did a great job of portraying 1940's hot springs, but for me it is interesting to read about a town in Arkansas that sounds just like the Las Vegas of today.  I thought the inclusion of real-life characters added to the story as well.<br />If you are a Hunter fan, definitely read this.  Other wise, try point of impact or Black light first.  I think they are better books.	2001-07-09

But being constistent is both good and bad.  1st to Die is suspenseful and exciting like many previous novels, but it breaks no new ground and is thus very predectible. A killer is on the loose killing newly married couples.  The first half of the book centers around Police inspector Lindsey Boxer leading the investigation and trying to find the killer.  She brings a reporter, a choroner and a lawyer into the group and together they try and solve the crime on their own.  By this time, you have grown to hate the killer and hope he gets caught.  The blurb on the book jacket says that the book has a startling conclusion that will totally change the reality of everything that preceded it.  I'm not one that tries to figure out endings to books, but when they found their first supsect, I knew it wouldn't be that easy.  I knew to expect one final twist at the end, and there was one, but it wasn't that startling. While Patterson can write good stories, I don't think he has surpise endings down very well.  A good surprise ending will be totally unpredictible while at the same time make sense.  In this book, the ending is predictible.  In another where he tried a surprise ending, Roses are Red, it didn't make sense. This book also has the typical romance, which means you can basically skip those short chapters.  One more minor complaint.  Patterson seems to enjoy writing from a woman's point of view.  Even Alex Cross seems to have a lot of feminine characteristics.  All of his main characters seem to enjoy fine art, fine wine, literature (not fiction).  Not a big deal, but it just makes all of his books seem that much more the same when from book to book the main characters all have the same interests. This is a good, entertaining book, just nothing ground breaking.  I recommend it, but don't get your hopes up about the ending.	2001-06-20

I decided to read it because the blurb on the back sounded interesting and I was familiar with Rhyme and Sachs from The Bone Collector movie.<br />I've read a few customer reviews, and I agree that the Empty Chair has a good plot and characters.  The book also had a lot of potential for suspense, but because of Deaver's writing, there is none.<br />I'll give an example of this without giving spoilers.  There is a scene in the book where two characters see someone and comment to each other about her.  Then Deaver describes this character threatening and then about to kill another character.  Scene Over.  The book cuts to a new scene where the threatened character is alive.  How, the reader wonders, did he make it?  Then Deaver describes in flashback about the first two characters who realized something was wrong in seeing that person where they did, then they burst into the room to prevent that person from doing the killing.  Now, why couldn't Deaver have described this as it actually happened.  I don't know.  But it takes away from the whole book, especially since all of the scenes are like this.  He leads you to believe one thing will happen and then something else happens.  There is no shock or suspense in revealing all of the surprises of the novel in flashback fashion.  It would be nice if Deaver would let us feel some of the excitement and suspense along with his characters.<br />I recommend you don't read this book.  I've read so many other authors who can handle a simple action scene so much better than Deaver...	2001-06-04

I've never read McBain before, but I have read three Hunter novels.  So the first half of this book, the part by Hunter, is just what I expected and quite interesting...The first half of the book ends with us realizing how obsessed Thorpe is and wondering what steps he will take to satify his desires and also wondering if he will ever get caught.<br />Then the second half begins and the book is ruined.  Several detectives are investigating the murder of a prostitute.  Thorpe turns out to be one of a few suspects.  The detectives research more of Thorpe, and the two worlds connect a little but never collide.<br />I kept waiting for Thorpe to be a significant player in the second half of the book.  But he never is, and thus the first half of the book is a waste.  And so is the second half and its own extremely weak conclusion.	2001-05-14

In my opinion, Grisham's last three books have been below average.  The Street Lawyer was a horrendous liberal rant.  The Testament was a punchless ode to missionaries.  The Brethren had an exciting plot without good characters.  I don't know why those books suffered, but this book is incredible.  I don't know why it turned out so well.  Maybe he spent more time on it or had more of a passion for the story, but I this book is certainly one of his bests.<br />At first glance, the plot summary on the book jacket seems very boring.  And maybe in a way the story is boring.  There are no super bad guys or heroic good guys or grand lawyerly schemes.  Instead, this book tells a simple story about the process of being cotton farmers, and relies on incredible characterization to be highly entertaining.<br />Three generations of Chandlers live on a cotton farm.  It would seem on the surface they live a simple life and are a lower class family struggling to make ends meet.  But through the eyes of the seven-year old narrator (whose words don't sound like a seven year old but whose world-view does), we see how complex their lives are.  We also learn about the strict class structure and are introduced to families who have it worse off that the Chandlers.  The Spruils, hill people who help harvest the crop, and the Mexicans, who migrate to work in the fields, both offer interesting perspectives and unique characters.  Then there are the lowest form of people.  The Latchers, sharecroppers who live in a shack in the creek bed.  Another interesting aspect of this book was the church life of the characters.  Luke Chandler, the narrator, gives the church's opinion on almost everything that happens.  This adds just another layer of realism to the small-town life in 1952 when all cotton farmers did was work all week then go to church on Sunday.<br />Many characters in this book interact and Grisham makes you care about all of them.  There are murders, sexual discovery, secrets, loss, sacrifice and revenge, all seen through the eyes of a seven year old.<br />This book is funny and interesting.  I highly recommend it.crifice and revenge, all seen through the eyes of a seven year old.<br />This book is funny and interesting.  I highly recommend it.	2001-05-01

But no one in their right mind can take this book seriously if they hold any type of Christian religious beliefs.<br />If you have belief system in which you believe Mary gave birth to Jesus and Jesus is the savior of the world, then you will have a problem with this book because it directly contradicts that theology.  It this book, two virgins are supposed to give birth to babies.  One will be the savior of the world, one baby will be the child of Satan.  All of this is supposedly prophesied at the Catholic miracle at Fatima (I'm a protestant, so I know nothing about Fatima.)  If you believe Jesus is the messiah, then you'll have a hard time believing a book where another messiah is supposed to be born in the 20th century.  If this were to be true, it would directly contradict the birth and purpose of Christ and it would add to the Bible.<br />I know Patterson wrote this as an intriguing thriller, but it fails.  A person with Christian beliefs can enjoy books by Stephen King about ghosts or Patterson's book Where the Wind Blows about children who can fly.  These books can be believed somewhat because ghosts and flying kids don't conflict with a Christian belief system.  This book does.  So if you believe the events of Cradle and All, you have to throw out what you believe about your religion.  Part of the fun of reading books is that you are able to picture the events happening in real life.  You can't do this with this book because another virgin birth would totally negate the existence of Christ.<br />But I don't think this book is sacreligious.  It was highly entertaining and well-written.  I thought all of the loose ends were tied up unlike some reviewers.  I know Patterson isn't a theologian, and I'm glad, because I don't buy into his views on the church and salvation.<br />Also, I would be curious as to what Catholics think of this book since it directly revolves around Fatima and the pope and many of their other traditions.<br />So, read this book but if you believe the Bible is true, then prepare to be disappointed.curious as to what Catholics think of this book since it directly revolves around Fatima and the pope and many of their other traditions.  <br />So, read this book but if you believe the Bible is true, then prepare to be disappointed.	2001-04-18

This is my first Dean Koontz book to read and will probably be my last because for the length of the book, it is not very good.<br />The chase is exciting and the background of Spencer Grant is quite interesting.  The goons from the government are creepy and sinister.<br />This book could have been a lot shorter and still been just as good.  Koontz seems to enjoy giving poetic desriptions to scenery before and after the action, none of which really matters.<br />The evil organization in the book is not believable.  I can accept the government does some shady things no one knows about.  But there is no way a agency like the one in this book would exist.  Therefore, Koontz looses a little credibility.<br />The final fight scene utilizes something out of star wars and seemed ridiculous.  Seemed Koontz just invented a weapon to get the characters out of an impossible situation.<br />Finally, the ending of the book is disappointing.  You find out that nothing is really settled.<br />If you haven't read this author, don't start.	2001-04-09

I am not reading another book in this series.  I hope I can convince many of you to quit reading as well.  You should stop reading this series because the writing is terrible and the religion is blasphemy (or at least, insulting).<br />The authors were blessed with a great idea and concept and they began it beautifully with the first Left Behind book.  But they have squandered God's gift by turning the series into a money-making merchandizing bonanza that takes away the focus from God and turns it on themselves.  They should be ashamed from squandering God's gift.<br />First, this book is called the Mark, but it's not really about that.  Maybe 10% of the book concerns people being forced to take the Mark of the Beast.  And then there is the blasphemous twist at the ending that proves to me that the Jenkins enjoys rewriting the Bible.<br />In Stephen King's recent book \\"On Writing,\\" he says that in order for writing to be believable, the characters have to do believable things.  They can do stupid and dumb things that a normal human would never do, but they have to be believable.  The characters in the Mark do stupid and dumb things that a stupid and dumb person wouldn't even do.<br />The premise that Ben-Judah is the only person who can interpret prophesy because he is a scholar and is studying the original biblical texts is insane.  There are millions of books on the market that explain what might happen after the rapture.  Those books will be available and the millions of those left behind will be able to use their own brain and will not rely only on a Hebrew scholar.<br />Rayford and Albie go under cover with Albie acting as Rayford's superior officer.  Jenkins spends pages commenting on how this is a conflict because Rayford is really Albie's superior in the Trib. Force.  Jenkins comments that Rayford will see that Hassid gives him a fake id that puts him at a higher rank than Albie as soon as possible.  This isn't a believable scenario.  Why would Rayford care if he is under Albie.  They are under cover!<br />Also, Buck seems to cry whenever possible.  And he says he needs to go where the action is so he can cover it for his cyber magazine which is just a lame plot excuse to get him on a plane to provide filler for a plotless meandering series.<br />Other complaints: 95,000 word length.  Readers taken advantage of by books coming out every six months.  Not even Grisham writes that fast.<br />All of the above are mostly complains I have had for awhile, yet I continued to read.  But the blasphemy and arrogance in this book is the reason why I will quit reading the series.  I realize, and the authors don't, that there are many different views on what takes place during the rapture.  Jenkins has decided to focus on every event in the 7-years, and then describes each event in from his narrow point of view.  Instead of covering each event, they should have focused on character development within a few events and a realistic plot.<br />Now, I'm only a layman, but my dad studied prophesy extensively while I was growing up, so I have some idea of what may happen.  Anyway, I don't know if Christians after the rapture will have their own mark that only they can see.  But I'll give them that.  I've also heard that people who have heard about and rejected Christ before the rapture won't have a second chance after the rapture.  I do agree with Lehaye and Jenkins that all people get a second chance.<br />The two blasphemous sections of the Mark have to do with free will and the Mark of the Beast.  First, Ben Judah discusses free will in his commentaries.  He says that if you accept Christ after rapture, you will not have the ability to forsake Christ and take the mark of the beast.  Jenkins makes it quite apparent that this is Judah's opinion, and not biblical.  I believe that just as it is up to us to choose Christ, he doesn't force himself upon us, we also can choose to deny him.  I can forsee many people choosing to take the mark ofthe beast because of peer pressure and the fear of dying.<br />Ben-Judah also says that if your name is in the Book of Life of the Lamb, it can never be removed.  Some Christians may believe this, but I don't, and neither do millions of others.  There are circumstances that cause people to turn from Christ.  Just because you profess your belief, it doesn't give you free reign to sin at will.  Killing and having sex with tons of people will get your name out of the book of life, I guarantee it.<br />But those two points are debatable, thisone is not.  In The Mark, a character takes the Mark of the Beast.  This is Revalations 101.  If you take the Mark, you are doomed to an eternity in hell.  But not in the world of Lehaye and Jenkins.  In their version of events, if you take the Mark of the Beast, you can still be a Christian, and therefore remain working with Carpathia so the Trib Force will have an inside member.  Yes folks, that's right.  Jenkins and Lehaye have betrayed Christ and millions of readers around the world by altering prophecy just to advance a worthless and unbelievable plot point.<br />Maybe someday after this terrible series has concluded, a real author will come along and do it right.  Until then, you would be better off reading the bible and imagining your own story in your head, because you will do a much better job and you probably won't blaspheme the Bible.<br />PLEASE DON'T READ ANY MORE OF THESE BOOKS!

A stalker begins to stalk Kate.  Problems from Kate's past continue to haunt her.  David tries to help Kate.  Stalker, affair, and Kate's past all meet in the end.<br />I think I understand the point Hunter was trying to make, but, just like in his novel Criminal Conversation, he fails to adequately portray the emotions involved in an affair.  He leaves many unanswered questions.  David appears to be in a good marriage with wife Helen, but Hunter shows no guilt on David's part.  He shows David wanting to stop the affair because it is inherently wrong, not because he still loves his wife.<br />I think the ending somewhat explains why we are never made to fill sorry for Helen or angry at David for having the affair.  Still, the ease at which a man can fall into an affair and then begin to lie about it while still supposedly loving his wife makes this book less than it could be.<br />The ending of the book also makes you think differently about some of the actions of the characters.  David could have done a lot of things to change the fate of some of the characters and to make his fate more enjoyable.<br />This book is short and easy to read.  Its not that bad if you are interested in the affair/sex/stalker genre.	2001-03-05

To me, this book is too much like Ashes to Ashes.  The cops are trying to solve a crime and they have many suspects and they go down many different roads until they finally figure it out.  And it turns out the killer was someone they had talked to many times.<br />It seems like Hoag draws out her novels by keeping the characters from finding out info that should have been quite obvious.  In this book, Kovac sleeps with someone and doesn't realize she is hiding a secret.  A secret that his painfully obvious to the reader way before Kovac figures it out.  This is frustrating because if Kovac had figured it out, then he might have solved the crime quicker.  But instead, he doesn't find out until the very end, which of course leads to the violent dramatic conclusion.<br />My problem is that this book contained nothing new.  While the ending wasn't predictable, I knew exactly what kind of plot devices the author was going to use.  The characters were also stereotypes.  The cops all had bad mouths and who wouldn't know that Ace Wyatt was also involved somehow.  Otherwise there is no reason for him to be in the story.	2001-02-20

This is my third King book to read and I think he is the best of all the writers I have read.  Unfortunately, I don't particularly enjoy his genre, but King is the best at writing believable characters and making you feel part of the story.<br />The first part of this book, the autobiography, read just like one of his novels.  I kept waiting for something sinister or crazy to happen, then I had to remind myself that this was a true story, not fiction.<br />Many people who buy this book are going to do so because they havve some sort of aspirations to be a writer.  The point I took from this book is that there are no magic secrets to writing, you just have to sit down and do it.  More time you spend trying to figure out how to write, the less time you will spend writing.  King gives a few valuable pointers on editing and structure.  His advice on not plotting, just starting with a situation and going from there might not be for everybody, but it makes sense.  King's inspirational advice says to just write for yourself, not for anyone else, and see what happens from there.<br />I definitely reccommend this book to any wanna-be writer or King fan.	2001-02-12

Forget the background of the mob story, although it is interesting, and realize that this is just a thrilling book about a woman having an affair.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened and read the last 250 pages in one day.  <br />I enjoyed this book so much because you could look at it from so many different angles.  First of all, since I am a married male, I looked at it from Michael's point of view.  His wife is cheating on him and I wanted to see what he would do when he found out.  Then you could be Andrew, the man who seduces Sarah, Michael's wife.  What are his motivations?  Then you want to know what motivates women cheat on her husband (or a man on his wife).  Thinking about that can be both chilling and thrilling.<br />While I liked this book a lot, I think it had a few weaknesses.  Hunter does not do enough at the beginning to establish that Michael and Sarah have a great marriage or even a good marriage.  I think if he had spent more time convincing the reader that these two shared a strong bond, then what had followed would be that more devasting.  We know Sarah has an affair, but to be able to know exactly what she was betraying would have made her betrayal that much worse.<br />Also, it seems that Sarah gave herself to Andrew rather easily (not a spoiler).  I guess that Andrew was charming and handsome, and that was all it took for Sarah to give away her life.  Again, it would have been better to know specifics in her life with her husband that she was very unhappy with.  Instead, we just get veiled references to the fact that he was working a lot.<br />This book has a good ending I guess.  Sarah was a frustrating character because I was never truly sure why she totally abandoned Michael and surrendered to Andrew.  I guess it was nothing Michael ever did, it was just that Sarah was a bad person. <br />I plan on checking out some more books by Hunter/Mcbain to see if they are as good as this one.	2001-01-22

After reading my review, you may think I am evil, stupid, satanic or cynical, and I want you to know I am none of that.  I am a Christian who loves to read.  Because I have read so many novels, I feel that I am a good judge of what is good and what isn't.  I have read this far and will continue to read to the end because I love the subject matter.  I think more movies and novels should be written about Revelations because I don't think the subject will ever grow old, until it actually occurs.  But, these authors, apparently blinded by the blind faith of the public, who buy these novels sight unseen, have decided they don't need to do quality work.  Just filling up the pages will do.  Here are some of my complaints.  Just remember that despite all I say, I am still going to read.  Maybe by the end, the authors will have changed my mind.<br />The first problem I have is with the plot.  The &quot;authors&quot; have decided that they want a member of their juvenile Tribulation Force to be present at every major event of the Tribulation.  That explains why Ray, Buck and T feel like they have to fly every where.  How can they afford this?  Where is the realism?  Also, the authors made Ray land in Greece while on the way home just so they could introduce a character who has the gift of discernment.  Earlier, they talked about Tsion discovering the finer points of intercession.  Again, these theological details take away from the story and do nothing to persuade non-Christians.  I have a feeling that those that are left behind, won't be spending there time studying deep theological issues.  They will be trying to stay alive.  John 3:16 is about as deep as they will get.<br />This brings me to a big complaint, and this is about the part when Tsion has an outer body experience and goes to heaven and sees Lucifer, Michael, and various other things.  I realize the events described are probably scriptural, but it is bordering on blasphemy for them to be covered in this book.. First of all, I know it is not scriptural for a person like Tsion to get a glimpse of heaven like he did.  I just get a creepy feeling all over while reading a fiction novel and then hearing the author try to describe events and scenery that NO ONE on earth knows about.  Again, this adds nothing to the story except to point out that the authors know a lot about theology.  I wish they would realize that the readers aren't biblical scholars, so they should quit trying to show off.  They should leave the out of body experiences to Shirley McClain and leave the descriptions of heaven to the Bible.  The conversation Tsion had with the angel Michael was the worst because it felt like they were adding words to the Bible.<br />Now, onto other problems.  Also, Ben Judah is not the only person in the world who is smart enough to read the Bible and figure out what is going to happen to them.  Why won't those millions of &quot;Ben-Judahites&quot; open their own Bible and figure out some of this stuff on their own.  My wife and I had a good laugh pondering the fact that the fate of the International Co-op rested in the hands of a 23 year old suicidal college drop out who wants to kill her baby.  This stuff is getting worse each book.<br />It is too bad we can't go back in time and give the responsibility of writing this conceptually ground breaking series to a good author who wasn't only focused on the large-print, wide margined, childish, overpriced paperback money making side of things.  I feel a great opportunity was wasted because the rapture and the tribulation is a great story and a great evangelical tool, but these authors have reduced it to just a trivial matter to be solved by a bunch of super humans who fly around the globe on a whim.<br />Another minor complaint I have is that half of the suspense in the book revolves around cell phones.  It seems like so many sections end with some one making a phone call to tell some one something, or trying to make a phone call to tell someone important information but they can't get through, or being on the phone with someone and not being able to tell them something, so they have to fly half way around the world to tell them in person.  These kind of plot devices are not the work of professionals.  Also, I wish Tim Lehaye would take his name off these books.  It was a good concept, but since he isn't doing the actual writing, why does he want to take the blame?<br />One last things.  Those plugs for other books are stupid.  Keep those out of here.<br />You may ask why I keep reading if I don't like this series.  Maybe it is because the story.  I know a lot about the prophecy of the end times in the bible so I am not relying on this series for all of the information.  I guess I am just curious.  But my curiosity is about to be overcome by my disappoint in the failure of the authors to come close to writing a good story.  I guess I will let my wife read the Mark first, and if she likes it, then I might read it.  It is obvious these stories are geared for only the Christian market, and that is very unfortunate, because the non-Christian market is who needs a book like this.tell someone important information but they can't get through, or being on the phone with someone and not being able to tell them something, so they have to fly half way around the world to tell them in person.

I didn't want the negative opinions of other readers to bias my judgement.<br />I thought this book was very good, much better that Pop goes the Wiesel and Cat and Mouse.  First of all, you have to realize that Patterson is going to leave out many details about the actual investigation.  He instead focuses on family life and how the investigation of the murders relates to him and his family.  Sometimes I think his books would be better if they included more details of catching the killer like some of his earlier books did.<br />Still, this book was good because it was easy to read and the ending was completely understandable and it made me want to go back and reread certain parts to see if I missed something.  I was afraid that this was going be like the last book where the killer has a vendetta against Cross for no reason, and therefore the final climax would be contrived and unbelievable.  But that wasn't the case with this book.  While the motives of the killer aren't clear, the identity of the killer is understandable.<br />Also, the whole family subplot is basically pointless and used just to add filler to make the book longer.  But since the chapters are short you don't have to waste too much time until you get back to the actual story.<br />This is not one of his best because it breaks no new ground, but still it is a good book.	2001-01-08

It is just a clever little rehash of common sense.<br />The actual parable of the mice, cheese and little people could be useful if you allowed people to read it for themselves and forge their own opinions.  But the filler at the beginning and the end is what relagates this book to one of the all-time rip-offs.  I guess the author thinks we are all idiots because he creates these shallow charichatures of normal people and has them talk down to the reader, telling the reader first what to think about the cheese story, and then second try to attribute all of the good things that will happen in their life to the cheese story.<br />This is self promotion at its best, or worst, however you want to look at.

There was action from the beginning.  This novel does a pretty good job of desribing the action leading up to one of the biggest events in the seven years, the assissination of the antichrist.<br />I knew that this novel would not reveal the identity of the assassin.

If I had no other books to read or nothing else to do, then this book was pretty good.  But it does not compare to previous Clancy novels nor does it stand on its own as a high quality novel. Where is the action?  Where is the suspense?  Looking back, what exactly happened the first six hundred pages since there was no action or suspense.  I guess it was filled with events leading up to the climactic battle between China and Russia, an event we all knew was going to happen based on the title.<br />This novel had no suspense.  We all knew what was going to happen in the end.  Also, having the same characters in every novel gets kind of old.  Clancy needs to create a new line of refreshing characters because he often assumes we remember these characters from previous novels and the characters are turning into cardboard cutouts that are just there to further the action.<br />Not a good effort from Clancy.

First, let me say that I understand why King is such a successful writer.  I cared  for the main characters Noonan and Mattie and Kyra and hated Devore.  King  described the life in Maine perfectly.  So I feel that I got out of the  story what King wanted me too, and I that is why I didn't like it.  I will  explain what I think was wrong with the story without giving away the plot.<br />The first half of the book is concerned with Noonan's wife Jo, Mattie  and her girl, and Devore.  There are several clues and mysterious  happenings concerning these people that lead me to believe that the book is  going to be about them.  The other mystery of the book revolves around the  town, its people, and Sara Tidwell (a black folk singer who died 100 years  ago and the person who Mike's house is named after).  There are a few odds  and ends sprinkled in the first part of the book about the town and its  history and mystery.  The problem is, there is not enough to make me care  about the town and its secrets.  So when the book makes a U-turn and the  primary plot of the book involves Sara Tidwell and the bad people of the  town, I really don't care.  King did not do a good job of convincing me  that I should care about the town and its people.  I wanted to focus on  Mattie and her child and Jo.  Sure, they are a part of the story too, but  really as only an means to the end of Sara and the town's terrible past.  The supernatural part of the book was somewhat interesting, with all of the  clues the ghosts (his wife) gave to Noonan.  Still, the clues never  appeared to lead where I thought they would, and that was frustrating.  This was a well written book that failed to convince me to care about the  ending.	2000-08-31

This book restored my faith in the series just enough to keep reading.  The first book was a great beginning and the second kept it going.  However, I made the mistake of listening to  books 3 and 4 on audio tape and they were terrible.  Appolyon was slow in  the beginning but it picks up in the middle with some exciting scenes  involving escapes from jerusalem and the plague of locusts.  The writer  Jenkins manages to make his vision of the future believable enough for me  to continue reading book six.  This book wasn't perfect though.  The  characters and dialogue have no depth.  Also, I have finally accepted that  in makes sense for Ben-judah to be a leader to all the believers.  But this  book makes it sound like he is the ONLY PERSON in the whole world that  knows what the sixth trumpet will be.  Come on, it is right there in the  bible for anyone to see.  Ben judah is not that much smarter than everyone.  Also, the books are way too short and the paperbacks are way too  expensive.  Making a paperback the size of a hardcover so you can charge  more money is not a Christian way to market a book.	2000-07-31

The relationship between the main character Fitgerald and his flawed wife showed that heroes in books don't always have perfect lives.  The terrorists lives were  interesting but, only because I wanted to find out what they would do at  the end.<br />There was nothing spectacular about this book, but for some  reason I kept reading and reading.  I think it is because anytime you see a  tragedy happen on the news, you wonder how you would have reacted in that  situation.  You wonder if you could have been a hero.  In this book, a  boring average guy becomes a hero and has to deal with the resulting  publicity.  Then he becomes a suspect and has to overcome the adversity to  get his life back.<br />I think the plot is what kept me reading, and not  the characters or the style of the author.  I don't think I'll read any  more books by Blauner unless they have a great sounding plot, because I  don't think he can carry a story on his own.	2000-07-17

I was so excited to hear about and then to read a book is so popular and deals with the end-times through the beliefs of Christians.  This book does a great job of portraying the confusion that would result if all of the  Christians in the world disappeared.<br />The authors probably should have  stopped with this book because they obviously don't have the experience or  the skill to make this a 12-volume series. (I have read the next four).  While the first book is original and covers a lot of ground, the following  books are just fluff pieces that move too slowly and don't offer the depth  that is required to cover such world changing events.<br />As a Christian, I  enjoy these books because they are a confirmation of my beliefs.  However,  since they are poorly written and overpriced (the paperbacks only), I can't  recommend purchasing the following books.<br />Still, I have fond feelings for  the first book and it was good enough to get me to read the next three, and  I plan on reading more, so overall I have to recommend the series.  Just  don't expect anything spectacular.<br />One more point.  Do not listen to  the audio books!  I did so for book 3 and 4 and they were terrible.  They  cut out so much that you can't follow the story.  And it is kind of creepy  listening to that guy carrying on a romantic conversation with himself  using two different voices.  Why couldn't he just read the book and let me  figure out who is talking?<br />Worth reading if you have the time and money  to invest in 12 books.	2000-07-12
US	50320963	R2DJHM8MZD58PZ	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Not as bad as I thought it would be	This is the first book I ever read where i sat out to prove to myself that it couldn't be as bad as all of the reviewers said it would be.  After all, the premise of the book sounded very intriguing. First, I wanted to see if  the ending was as bad as everyone said it was, and second, I wanted to see  if the characterization way below Grisham standards. For the people who  said Grisham cut this book off twenty pages short, they are wrong.  Sure,  the ending may have not been what they wanted, but Grisham ties up all lose  ends.  Your questions are answered and no sequel is necessary (although one  might be interesting).  I happened to like the ending, even though there  were no bombshell surprises or twists. About the characters, this is one of  Grisham's worst.  Even in the terrible Street Lawyer, I at least knew and  cared about the characters.  In this book, I could never separate in my  mind the judge from California and Texas.  To me, they were interchangeable  and therefore Grisham failed in making me care about them.  You may enjoy  the book better if you just think of the three Brethren as one character.  The other characters weren't that bad, although we maybe could have known  more about Aaron Lake since he was a key to the plot. This book wasn't bad,  but I don't like the fact that Grishams books are so short.  Take an extra  few months and add another 100 pages.  That would make it worth the money  instead of a trip to the library.	2000-07-03
US	50320963	R2MQGH17VCKSVF	0446360589	756714989	The Burden of Proof	Books	3	14	17	N	N	A great book, until the end	This was my first Turow book to read.  It took me awhile to get used to his writing style, but once I did, I was hooked.  I was enthralled by the characters and the story line and couldn't wait to find out what happened  next.  Throughout the first 4/5 of the book, Turow adds many unexpected  plot twists that add to the mystery.  However, what could have been a great  book just turns into an average book because of the end.  I guess I  expected too much.  I wanted to see a totally unexpected surprise that went  against everything I thought would happen, but it just never came.  Instead, Turow lays out slowly piece by piece the solution to the puzzle.  Sure, the ending was not what I expected, but it wasn't a surprise.  Turow  never gives you time to be shocked or surprised at the ending.<br />I liked  this book because Turow does shock and surprise throughout the first part  of the book.  His characters are well written.  I will probably read  another of his books, I just won't expect the big surprise ending.	2000-06-19

I have read all of Gardner's and Benson's books and seen all the movies and this book actually has something none of the others have.  While many reviewers disliked the entire mountain climbing scenario, I enjoyed it.  Bond has to battle the elements as well as the obvious enemies.  While  reading toward the climax, I enjoyed the trip along the way.  Now, if only  the bond movies could come up with an original plot. I don't read Bond  books for their ground breaking plot or literary skill.  I read them  because they are easy to read and they are about Bond.  Don't take these  books too seriously.	2000-06-05
US	50320963	R1JQFMJ8U4EKP0	0446605050	832421972	The Intruder	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Story revolves around only three characters	This novel was just average and it took me forever to get excited about it.  I finally started enjoying the last 100 pages.  This novel has only three main characters and the plot is pretty straight forward.  You have  the lawyer and family being harassed by the Intruder and the  handyman/mobster who comes to the aid of the lawyer.  If you think you know  the ending halfway through the book, you are probably right.  If you like  to read a lot of books, I recommend this one as a change of pace.  I did  buy Man of the Hour by the same author so I liked Intruder enough to read  the same author.  If you are choosy about your books, then skip this one.	2000-05-31
US	50320963	R2FHGV9DVB40TP	0316693286	373226516	Pop Goes the Weasel (Alex Cross)	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Plot has many holes.	This book is pretty exciting if you can manage to overlook all of the editing errors and plot errors.  However, while reading towards the end of the book, I kept wondering why they weren't prosecuting the Weasel for the  Jane Doe murders.  Considering all of the evidence that Patterson writes  about, there would have been more than enough evidence to convict the  Weasel but Patterson just ignores the obvious in order to focus on the one  trial.  Patterson writes about Cross spending hours and hours of time on  the Jane doe murders when it appears all of the evidence is right in front  of him. Also, the whole &quot;Christine&quot; story line is far fetched.  Patterson tends to go overboard in emphasizing that he understands the  black family and culture (whick I don't think he does).  I don't think a  five year old kid would be listening to the soundtrack from  &quot;Beloved&quot; while doing the dishes. Patterson needs to work on the  time line of his story.  Supposedly the action takes place in a year and  half.  Cross is getting dumber because he should have solved this one in  about two months.	2000-03-20
US	50320963	RMVPMH7NS7X1U	0684853515	692650386	Hearts In Atlantis	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Makes you wonder...	This was my first Stephen King book and I enjoyed it.  He made me care about what happened to all of the characters in each of the section.  Being born in 1972, I was not alive during the Viet Nam War.  Reading this book  makes me thankful that I was not, and also makes me wonder what side I  would have taken had I been alive back then.<br />This book does not rely on  horror and the supernatural for its thrills, but instead relies on  pshycological drama in each of its characters.  A good book to read for a  first time Stephen King.	2000-02-09
US	50320963	R1VO7VARLA48C8	0679450432	835692581	Dark Lady	Books	3	7	7	N	N	average for patterson	Patterson has the unique ability to make the reader care about the chapter he is reading alone by itself.  I found myself reading because I wanted to see what happened next, even though the climax wasn't for another 200  pages.  Patterson makes the characters interesting and constantly reveals  new info which makes each part of the book valuable.  Unfortunately the  deep mysteries or tragedies that haunt some of the characters turn out to  be much more minor than one would expect.<br />This is a good story, although  Patterson does like to write about twisted sex a lot.	2000-01-26
US	50320963	R2E6HHUFQ0MGNA	0440225701	454775948	The Street Lawyer	Books	1	6	8	N	N	worst book ever	It has been awhile since I read this book, and it has not gotten better with time.  The story has a great beginning, when a homeless person wreaks havoc at the main character's law firm.  Because of this and a little  research, he has a sudden attack of conscience.  The quest for the truth is  interesting, but the main guy's sudden moral empathy for the homeless is  ridiculous.  The primary thing I remember is how unbelievable the character  interaction was with his wife.  Okay, they are getting a divorce, but give  us a legitimate reason.  I kept thinking they were going to stay together  because Grisham never really gave a reason why they should seperate.  Sure,  the wife might be dissappointed that he quits his job, but they could work  around it.  This is the first book I ever read that did not have a climax.  After reading the end, I said &quot;so what.&quot;  I knew that was going  to happen, why is that surprising.  Maybe I did not care for the book  because Grisham was trying to justify all of the money he is making by  making himself to be a caring, charitable person.	2000-01-06
