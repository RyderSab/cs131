There were so many possible suspects and I couldn't stop reading until I found out \\"whodunnit\\".  There were twists and turns and it was very fast paced.  I don't want to give anything away, but you won't be disappointed with this book.  Uncover the college secrets of the past and have a great read!	2005-03-07

I loved Split Second and was hoping for a continuation of thrills but...there were just too many murders, too many details and it just seemed like the author was trying to do too much in one book.  The suspense just wasn't what I had hoped it would be because the reader was lost in so many of the extras.  Murders were happening left and right without much build up for each so they almost seemed trivial and the reader just glossed right over them because before you knew it, another one happened.  I haven't given up on the author, I just hope his next book is better.	2005-03-07

It was a total let down for me and I wished I didn't bother to read.  I think it had the potential, it just didn't follow through at all.	2005-02-01

I agree with other reviewers that I wasn't sure I'd like the whole circus theme, but it was so easy to get wrapped up in the animals and Daisy's close bonds with them.  I wanted to keep reading and even found myself shedding a tear or two at times.  This was a heart-warming story that I found delightful.	2003-07-28
