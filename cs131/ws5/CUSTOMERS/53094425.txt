While Yoel, the protagonist, was a secret service agent, and while he struggles to remember key events from his past that haunt him, this is not a book about secret agents.  There is no huge climax.  No car chases.<br /><br />Instead, this is a story of a man recovering from trauma, learning to relate to people, learning to love his daughter, learning to live without his wife.  He wanders through his days in a fog, focusing on tiny details of the world, while not responding to the largest figures in his life.  It is a story of a sad man who doesn't even know he is sad.<br /><br />The textures of the book are amazing, giving the reader a perfect sense of the confusion and separation that is Yoel's life.  The story builds nicely, and provides some suspense, but the main focus here is the window into the mind of a lost man.	2005-06-19

If you do have lower levels of sexual satisfaction or functioning, this book provides enormously helpful exercises and advice.<br /><br />One of the most powerful chapters explains the origins and impact of the sexual myths that most of us are captive to.  I'll list a few briefly here just to give you a flavor of the book's approach and emphasis.  \\"In sex, as elsewhere, it's performance that counts; the man must take charge of and orchestrate sex; a man always wants and is ready to have sex; sex equals intercourse; sex requires an erection; good sex is a linear progression of increasing excitement terminated only by orgasm; in this enlightened age, the preceding myths no longer have any impact on us.\\"  To illustrate the pervasiveness of these myths, Silbergeld quotes liberally from literature and film.  (Henry Miller in particular comes off looking rather silly.)<br /><br />In my sincere and deeply felt opinion--I know it sounds trite--all men should read this book.	2005-06-02

He's about as radical as it gets in the US.  Let's see how censored Chomsky himself has been, shall we?<br /><br />Strangely, there is a wide consensus in the United States regarding Chomsky's importance and influence.  According to the NNDB database, Chomsky is \\"a profoundly influential voice\\".  The New Statesman argues, \\"For anyone wanting to find out more about the world we live in...there is one simple answer: read Noam Chomsky.\\"  In addition, we all must agree with the words of Business Week, which says \\"With relentless logic, Chomsky bids us to listen closely to what our leaders tell us--and to discern what they are leaving out.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Chomsky is an extremely popular lecturer around the United States, speaking on U.S. foreign policy, Mid East politics, and related subjects.  He has authored more than 30 books on political subjects, and has been a political icon for three generations of the American Left.  For example, The Village Voice notes \\"Chomsky's early books criticizing U.S. policy in southeast Asia were bibles of the Vietnam anti-war movement.\\"  His book \\"For Reasons of State,\\" concerns the upheavals in domestic and international affairs of the 1970s. The New York Times Book Review noted that it \\"Displays those qualities which exemplify the finest traditions of intellectual responsibility.\\" An anthology of his writings, \\"The Essential Chomsky\\" has sold more than 45,000 copies, and was lauded by The Quality Paperback Book Club.<br /><br />In over 30 years of writing, Chomsky's antipathy toward the U.S. government has never wavered.<br /><br />His political thought has been the subject of several serious monographs, among which are M. Rai, Chomsky's Politics (London: Verso, 1995); P. Wilkin, Noam Chomsky: On Power, Knowledge and Human Nature (New York: St. Martin's Press Inc., 1997); A. Edgley, The Social and Political Thought of Noam Chomsky (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).<br /><br />He is not merely an ivory-tower intellectual, however.  As the socialist website MarxMail.org has stated, \\"The Marxist movement can learn much from Chomsky, most of all how to speak to the ordinary citizen.\\"<br /><br />His message is spread on tapes and CDs; he is promoted at rock concerts by superstar bands such as Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, and U-2 (whose lead singer Bono called Chomsky a \\"rebel without a pause\\"). He is the icon of Hollywood stars like Matt Damon whose genius character in the Academy Award-winning film Good Will Hunting is made to invoke Chomsky as the go-to authority for political insight.<br /><br />On the Web, there are more chat room references to Noam Chomsky than to Vice President Dick Cheney and 10 times as many as there are to Democratic congressional leaders Richard Gephardt and Tom Daschle.<br /><br />In short, according to The Observer, he is \\"the Elvis of Academia.\\"<br /><br />Uniquely among political writers, Mr. Chomsky has three books in Amazon.com's Top 2000.<br /><br />Mr. Chomsky's book \\"9-11\\" is a best seller (it has made the best-seller lists of The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, The Village Voice and Amazon.com) with over 300,000 copies sold.  According to Michael Massing, the book's genesis was the huge number of interview requests made to Mr. Chomsky after the attacks of 9/11.  He was unable to keep up with all the media demands on his time, and so published an anthology of interviews on the subject.<br /><br />In fact, there seems to be a great demand among the heretofore slumbering American public for works critical of their government.  I am happy to report that \\"9-11\\" is just one successful book, according to The Village Voice, among many that \\"assail the Bush administration as hypocritical, incompetent, and corrupt.  Stupid White Men by Michael Moore now has 500,000 copies in print and is still number five on the New York Times Top 10.\\"  It is a very good sign that publishers see the opportunity to make money off the criticism of Bush's policies.  As one publisher said,  \\"No one wants to miss the next Stupid White Men.\\"<br /><br />Another example of this hopeful trend is \\"The Best Democracy money can Buy: The Truth About Corporate Cons, Globalization and High-Finance Fraudsters,\\" written by Greg Palast.  The Village Voice quoted Palast as saying,  \\"What I'm happy about is that with no money, no marketing, and a completely amateur operation, you can get 40,000 copies sold in the U.S.-- if you've got something to say.\\"  Palast has just sold the paperback rights to his book to American publisher Penguin Putnam for an undisclosed, but reportedly very high, amount.<br /><br />In summary, Palast's story can be seen as emblematic of a new generation of American political critics.  As the Village Voice puts it, \\"The rise of Palast's media star--he's putting his Observer column on hold to work on films and books, and will be contributing to Harper's--is coinciding with the expanding of America's appetite for unsanctioned perspectives.\\"<br /><br />Chomsky's \\"9-11\\" has been more successful than these other two books, however, perhaps because of his higher profile and more intense media coverage of his work in general. (Chomsky's publisher keeps its eyes on the bottom line: even the small pamphlet \\"What Uncle Sam Really Wants\\" has sold over 160,000 copies.) Mr. Chomsky's publisher took out front-page ads in national newspapers and magazines, and, according to The Village Voice, the book \\"received prominent placement in bookstores upon its release.\\" In light of its controversial claims,<br /><br />\\"...the mainstream media came calling on the<br />iconoclastic Chomsky.

The book bravely identifies the fact that \\"America's government and its corporate giants exercise control over what we read, see and hear.\\" The book was reviewed very favorably in the New York Times, which called it \\"[A] compelling indictment of the news media's role in covering up errors and deceptions in American foreign policy of the past quarter century.\\"<br /><br />Four of his books have been made into films, among which \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" has been called (by Inroads magazine) \\"among the most viewed documentaries of all time.\\"<br /><br />Chomsky is among the American media's 100 most-cited intellectuals, according to Inroads Magazine.

But buyer beware: this is a very, very skimpy book.  Once you count in the chapter-title pages, and the half pages that begin and end each chapter, there are just not many words to read.<br />In addition, most of the novelty content, such as it is, stems from the marriage of some very familiar yoga postures with Buddhist tonglen meditation.  Don't buy this book if you think it has a wealth of information on some interesting &quot;Tibetan&quot; asanas.  There is not much of that at all here.<br /><br />However, however.  I am convinced that if you follow this book carefully, you will achieve great results.

US	53094425	R1YQO21TQULJTS	0195130766	379364775	The Islamic Threat : Myth or Reality? (Third Edition)	Books	2	22	28	N	N	Good reseach, poorly written and argued.	Esposito's book is helpful in many ways-mostly because it shows that \\"political Islam,\\" \\"fundamentalist Islam\\" and like terms inaccurately imply a certain uniformity of opinion and agenda to very disparate groups.  In short, there exists a powerful reformist current among Islamic political groups that seems willing to work within democratic political institutions-should any such thing appear in the countries in which they exist.<br />Esposito demonstrates these points nicely.  However, he implies that these two points undercut those who argue that militant, reactionary Islamic groups are a real danger.  A second, and related, problem is that Esposito consistently glosses over the truly objectionable (from a liberal-pluralist view, anyway) actions taken by Islamic governments and groups.<br />He takes exception to the designation of Khaddafi as a major sponsor of terrorism (p.82), yet is not willing to discuss precisely what Khaddafi's actions have been in this regard. Similarly, he provides a list of nasty things that \\"Iran was accused of\\" (p. 121) without saying much about the truth or falsity of those accusations.  He argues that both charges are exaggerated. Fair enough, but he simply asserts the accusations were in fact inaccurate, without providing an argument to support his assertion.<br />The author's style is shown clearly in the chapter on \\"Islamic Organizations: Soldiers of God.\\"  First, he quotes some newspapers to demonstrate that there is an hostility to political Islam, then wants to argue that this hostility is misplaced and simplistic. \\"Yet again the reality is far more complex than its popular image.  The majority of Islamic organizations would claim that, where permitted, they work within the political system...Many Islamic organizations today espouse liberalization and democratization\\" (p. 128).  Citing what such organizations \\"would claim\\" or what they \\"espouse\\" is perhaps a bit disingenuous.  What we need to know is what they plan to do, and whether they plan \\"one man, one vote, one time\\"-to end any democratic opening by establishing an Islamic state.  Esposito notes that such questions are difficult to answer-most organizations are factionalized and many are unclear about their ultimate intentions.  However, this does not refute those who argue that such organizations are dangerous.  He makes the same point again and again, and it is no more convincing each time: Political Islam is heterogeneous, and therefore those who say it represent a danger are wrong.  Esposito would have been more accurate to point out that many of those (newspaper columnists) who argue as to the supposed dangers of Islam are really only referring to a small, if violent, subset of Islamic organizations.<br />Simply put, Esposito is not skilled at argumentation-his strengths are in research and synthesis.  For example, the author makes an interesting comparison on p. 215.  He asks rhetorically why people have feared democratization in the Islamic world, but not in Eastern Europe? Is it \\"because...we believe... the Judeo-Christian tradition... is more democratic?\\" Good question.  He implies that we in the West simply dismiss Muslim societies as \\"not conducive to democratization or modernity.\\"  Bad answer.  It seems obvious that, whatever the problems of Eastern Europe, very large, mass-based political parties and organizations with highly questionable allegiance to democracy-and some with a history of militance and terrorism-simply don't exist on the same scale as in many Muslim societies.  That is, communism is discredited, and the major parties all want in to NATO and the EU (for good or for ill).  It's an obvious riposte, but one that apparently didn't occur to Esposito.<br />The book is not particularly well written.  His use of parenthetical comments is excessive and confusing, and he seems allergic to the use of the comma.  He repeats himself almost verbatim at several points, making parts of the book seem like a rough draft-andthis is the third edition!  Most seriously, in the last, most important, chapter-where he takes on Huntington and Lewis-the footnotes are mis-ordered starting on number 29-one is missing, and the rest are accordingly inaccurate.  How did the editor at Oxford University Press let that happen?<br />To return to the book's strengths, it is quite good at demonstrating that the truly reactionary, militant groups-for example in Algeria-were in large part radicalized by oppressive governments.  Esposito also shows nicely that the U.S. is quite happy to support secular autocratic governments in the Middle East and elsewhere, yet decries as dangerous those Islamic groups which someday, just might form an autocratic government.  These are very helpful points.  But overall, the book is over-rated by those who have reviewed it here and elsewhere. Let me give one more example of the author's style of argumentation to make my point.<br />In the final chapter, he writes, \\"Despite stereotypes of activists as fanatics who wish to retreat to the past, the vast majority share a common call for the transformation of society not through a blind return to seventh-century Medina but a response to the present\\" (p. 209).  Note that there is no necessary contradiction between these to supposedly contradictory positions.  That is, if we grant that the Islamists' proposed return to seventh-century Medina is not \\"blind,\\" but, let's say, a reasoned and thoughtful \\"response to the present\\"-as Esposito shows it to be-then the stereotype is in fact reasonably accurate.  Okay, so the call for a return to the past is not \\"blind\\", or unanimous-but it still might pose a danger for those who don't want to go along.draft-and this is the third edition!

The review below shows the passion this episode created and can still evoke.  To argue that Nauman wasn't &quot;fired&quot; is rather disingenuous.  The letter he received stated &quot;The Governing Board of the Ocean Hill Brownsville Demonstration School District has voted to end your employment in the schools of this district.&quot;  Sounds like a pink slip to me.<br /><br />More importantly, as the reviewer below notes, is that &quot;community control&quot; was seen as as the last-ditch solution to the persistent problems faced by African-Americans in the school system.  They were (and are) getting third-rate educations.  The argument was (and is): why?  &quot;Cultural&quot; reasons?  Racism?  If the African-American community ran its own schools, the argument went, black children would learn better.  For various reasons, many of them political, it didn't turn out that way.  The most important result was to divide the city by race--especially the Jews from the blacks.<br /><br />One of the key points made by this book is that the Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike had the effect of making New York Jews &quot;white&quot; in the sense that they joined with their Italian and Irish outer-borough neighbors against the blacks.  This seismic shift has largely remained intact.<br /><br />You can easily get by with reading only chapters 1-3, 5-6.<br /><br />Read this book if you have an interest in New York City history, politics of the &quot;white backlash&quot;, and/or the rise of conservatism in the 1970s.	2003-09-25

The other &quot;daily readings/mediations&quot; books suffer from an almost complete lack of coherence.  Quotes are tossed at the reader with little or no context, and therefore one can't learn much from them.  This volume, however, brings together entire sutras and other works, abridges, them and puts them into a daily readings format.  There is something for all Buddhists here: Shantideva and Milarepa for Tibetan Buddhists, the Dhammapada for Theravadins, good Zen quotes for Zen students, etc.  This doesn't mean that the material is easy--some of the Mahayana sutras are rather difficult at times.  But if you are looking for easy-to-swallow quotes, get a self-help book.	2003-09-24

This &quot;problem&quot; is not limited to Christians, however much we Buddhists would like to think so.  Tim Ward shows how Theravada Buddhism, with its stress on the &quot;perfect Dhamma&quot; and hundreds of rules, can be corrupted in practice.  Example: monks seem to take advantage of ignorant laypeople.  Not surprising; monks are people, too.  Example: cliques form in the monastery, and monks can be catty and nasty to each other.  Not surprising, of course, but you never hear about it.  Example: monks aren't allowed to kill anything.  So, they take a layperson with them into the jungle, and say, &quot;Get rid of this&quot;, pointing at weeds or whatever needs to be cleared.  This is not consistent with the spirit of the rules, but it follows the letter of the rules.  Thus the problems of literalism raise their head.  Tim Ward is a gentle, well meaning traveller who does all Buddhists a favor by showing that  Buddhism can fall victim to the problems of all religions.	2003-09-20

The author is obviously quite heavily influenced by Buddhism.  He<br />often mentions, for example, what are in Buddhism<br />called &quot;The Three Poisons&quot;: greed, anger and delusion.<br />You want to stay away from them.<br />But he certainly doesn't push Buddhism.  His main aim<br />seems to be to add meditation practices to<br />Christianity--which for many Christian contemplatives,<br />have always been present--and that makes perfect<br />sense.  Trying to be more present with one's children<br />and spouse, slower to anger, more responsive and less<br />reactive--those aren't really &quot;Buddhist&quot; in any sense<br />other than Buddhism stresses meditation, which is the<br />main instrument to attain those goals.  So it's not<br />really a Buddhist book, but rather a meditation book<br />for Christians, perhaps (with lots of politics thrown<br />in).<br />His anti-consumerist argument seems, from a Buddhist<br />point of view, rather beside the point.  We can get<br />caught up in all sorts of stuff that isn't good for<br />us.  Compulsive shopping is a problem because it's<br />compulsive, not because it's shopping.  Granted,<br />television pushes consumerism, but then the problem is<br />really one of watching too much TV.  As for the<br />economics in the book, I wasn't impressed.  All that<br />&quot;community-owned businesses&quot; stuff is fine for us<br />middle-class folks, for example.  But I guarantee that<br />when the poor people want to buy cheap clothes for<br />their kids they don't care whether WalMart is a<br />multi-national or a multi-vitamin: they want cheap<br />clothes.  And locally owned businesses don't tend to<br />provide that; that's why they keep going out of<br />business.  So he should stick to theology.<br />My big question: just where is the Christianity in the<br />book?  That is, it doesn't seem to be really a<br />Buddhist book OR a Christian book.  He seems to be<br />trying to make up his own religion as he goes along,<br />without really telling us what to do with the old<br />religion, or, really, what the new religion has to do<br />with Christianity.<br />He says several times that he is a &quot;recovering<br />Fundamentalist,&quot; which seemed a gratuitous insult, but<br />that's not my main complaint.  If he's not a<br />literalist, then what is he?  If the Bible is not<br />meant to be read literally, then how should we read<br />it?  How are we supposed to read, say, the<br />Resurrection?

Thurman is a Buddhist in the Tibetan tradition (as am I), and his introduction to this volume, while very valuable and succinct, makes no claim at objectivity.  He asserts that the Tantrayana (Tibetan Buddhism, to simplify) is superior to the Mahayana and Theravada traditions because it represents the culmination of Buddhism's &quot;progression.&quot;  Right off the bat, that makes me uncomfortable. Why must the pious Theravadins be consigned to an inferior, &quot;early-stage&quot; Buddhism?  Why make such hurtful invidious comparisons?  It seems beneath a genuine practitioner.  To answer my own rhetorical question, perhaps it is because Mahayana Buddhists are often a bit defensive.  This is the result of being accused of not having a &quot;genuine&quot; canon, in the sense that most admit the works were composed (not just written down) after the Death of the Buddha.  Similarly, Thurman attempts to argue against those who claim Tibetan Buddhism represents an effort by early proselytizers to offer a pantheon of gods and a lurid conception of the Buddha(s) to Hindus.  His response to this argument is limited to two sentences and is not convincing.  He simply asks, rhetorically, If that was the aim of Mahayana Buddhists, why did they keep the Buddha at all?  Why not just become Hindu?  But surely it is believable to assert that Buddhists wanted to broaden the attraction of their religion while keeping what they saw as its key elements.<br /><br />On the question of which miracles to believe (and Tibetan Buddhism is chock full of them), Thurman simply accepts a great number of them, while consigning other claims, such as the 500-year lifespan of one &quot;living Buddha&quot;, to the realm of myth.  How can he tell the difference between myth and religious reality?  Either accept all the fantasical claims or tell us how to pick and choose among them.<br /><br />A word of warning, as well. Despite the claims of other reviewers, most of the material in this book is quite difficult and will not reward those who do not have considerable background in Buddhism.  If you'll note the cheap prices for used copies, above, you'll see that I'm not alone in this view.<br /><br />The weirdest thing: Thurman apparently has decided to replace the word &quot;karma&quot; with &quot;evolution&quot;.  In the classic texts, therefore, where one would read &quot;fruit of karma,&quot; or whatever, Thurman offers &quot;evolutionary progress,&quot; for example.  This is perhaps defensible, but he offers no justification.  That seems quite a big departure for translators of the Dharma. Doing away with karma to make it a) more accessible to modern readers?; 2) more attractive to modern readers?; 3) because perhaps Thurman (as many of us are) is uncomfortable with the teachings that claim starving babies are simply reaping the fruits of miserly conduct in previous lives?  Such a major change needed at least some justification and explanation.<br /><br />All that said, get this book if you are a Tibetan practioner with considerable knowledge of the Dharma.  It offers a nice collection of very important works.te difficult and will not reward those who do not have considerable background in Buddhism.

Let's get that straight.<br /><br />However, he tends to repeat his message (often verbatim) from one book to the next.  If you know his work, you'll recognize a lot of it here.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you haven't read him before, then this is a good place to start.  It is an admirable attempt at ecumenicalism.<br /><br /> Another caveat: the Christianity that he discusses is not the sort much practiced.  That's his point, in part: it should be more practiced.  Fair enough, he's right about that.  But he tends to cite the Christian mystics with whom he feels most affinity (Thomas Merton, especially) and ignore how most people view Christianity.<br /><br />In short, if you are a Christian, you should read this book to get another take on your religion.  If you are a Buddhist familiar with Thay Hanh's writings, however, you won't find out much about Christianity as it is practiced, and you'll already be familiar with much of what he says about Buddhism.	2003-06-11

Books	2	27	37	N	N	if you are a true believer, you'll love this book	Service learning is often a very productive exercise.  Students can learn a lot in the community, and link it to readings and lectures in powerful ways.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />This book does not offer an objective analysis of service learning. It is written by proponents, for promotional purposes.  If you want critical thinking, analysis and--above all--realistic treatment of potential problems, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The major issues:<br /><br />There are literally hundreds of student quotes sprinkled liberally throughout this book; none are critical of service-learning in general, or of their own placements and experiences. As a teacher who has had students participate in such projects for the last ten years, I can assure you that the authors simply chose to not include some negative student reviews.  This stuff is hard to do well, and when it does not go well, students don't like it at all.<br /><br />The authors repeatedly criticize \\"traditional\\" instruction methods, and then cite studies supporting their views.  When you look up the citations, you find that those authors are also true believers in service learning. It's a charmed circle of friendly reviewers and proponents.  No critical voices are treated seriously.<br /><br />Perhaps the most seriously for those of you thinking of implementing service learning in your classes, this book offers no analysis of which types of courses work best with service learning, and which do not.  The authors repeatedly use the \\"soup kitchen\\" and \\"homeless shelter\\" examples, as though those placements would be of use to a course on Greek history or Organic Chemistry.  One striking sentence in this context is the following: \\"Finding service that roughly matches course content is fairly straightforward.\\" As an instructor with much experience in this field, I can tell you that this is just not accurate.  Further, this brief sentence is the beginning and the end of their discussion of finding good placements.<br /><br />If you are going to send students off on some project in the community, and try to link it to a class you are teaching, wouldn't you want to know of potential problems and whence they might come?  This book offers nothing of the kind.

The potted histories of the USSR, Poland etc. are completely superfluous.  The only original work is in the last 3 chapters.  Even there, however, there are lots of problems, including more secondhand histories for no reason.  Social Democracy is dismissed in a few pages as \\"in crisis.\\"  This allows him to make the case for revolution instead of reform.  When we finally get to the argument, he makes no attempt to respond seriously to potential objections.  In short, very heavy on rhetoric and cant, and very light on careful analysis.	2002-09-19

Note that it is basically an edited volume of translated pieces, and as such is not perhaps the best introduction to the subject.  The first two translations in the volume, especially &quot;Death and the Bodhisattva Trainings&quot; are very instructive and inspiring.  Many of the other translations, however, are quite esoteric and detailed.  If you have some previous knowledge of this subject, this could well be a rewarding read.

One of the best parts is the section on how to be a good listener. As a man (yes, a generalization is coming up), I sometimes am not the best listener in the world.  The author's discussion of listening is very well done, and can help both men and women deal with that sometimes awkward period at the end of the day when someone wants to describe how horrible her co-worker is, etc.  Other parts are really quite helpful as well.<br /><br />That being said, however, and as the previous reviewer has clearly stated, this book is not at all focused on Buddhism or any Buddhist &quot;approach.&quot;  In fact, most of the little quotes the author offers are from Sufi mystics.<br /> Like it or not, this &quot;If the Buddha&quot; thing (the author's previous book is &quot;If the Buddha Dated&quot;) is a marketing gimmick, and nothing more.<br /><br />What's next?  &quot;If the Buddha Ate Meat: Barbecuing with the Buddha&quot;?

After that period, however, the author tends to see the politics of the city as a battle between the good guys in white hats versus the bad guys in black hats.<br /> Freeman's shallow, tendentious treatment of New York's fiscal crisis of the 1970s, for example (perhaps the most important event in the second half of the twentieth century for New York), allows him to portray it as a mere excuse for mean spirited, right-wing attacks on labor's gains.  According to Freeman, the good guys (labor and its allies) sought to defend their eminently reasonable and necessary social-democratic policies, while the bad guys (lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) used the purported budgetary problems as an excuse to roll back social welfare policies.  Even those unfamiliar with New York, however, will realize that generous social welfare programs, combined with strong municipal unions and pervasive political patronage is, at the very least, expensive.  If you want to go that policy route, you have to be willing to pay for it-you can't just borrow money forever.  But even that limited degree of complexity is more than Freeman presents.<br /> For Freeman, recent New York politics is as simple as \\"social democracy\\" for the people versus right-wing \\"ideologues.\\" For that reason, to take but one example, the treatment of recent immigration is egregiously shortchanged.	2002-01-13

Even his detailed descriptions of Hitler's and Stalin's regimes also include some interesting analyses on their similarities and differences.  But in his descriptions (and they are just that, with virtually no effort at analysis) of two African regimes, Iraq and Argentina, and Duvalier in Haiti and Trujillo in the D.R. are shallow and perfunctory.  At the end, he completely runs out of steam.  The concluding chapter, which purports to put forward some \\"formal propositions\\", does not even attempt to draw together the material from the various case studies, and confines itself to rather sophomoric generalizations.<br /><br />Furthermore, Chirot has a pointless and distasteful habit of relating the prurient details of these tyrants' personal lives.<br /><br />A research assistant could have put together most of this book, as the bulk of it simply recapitulates various secondary sources.  Not much analysis here, even for undergraduates, and it's a waste of time for grad students.	2002-01-12

This is a wonderful introduction to some of the complicated and not-so-complicated tenets of Buddhism.  But in some ways I agree with &quot;Watch your step!&quot;, one of the reviewers below.  Hanh's is a very personal interpretation, and one with which not all Buddhists will agree.  Specifically, he takes a somewhat revisionist view of the nature of suffering and its relation to the Buddha's teaching.<br /> He writes, for example, after putting his own views across in a gentle and persuasive way, &quot;I hope scholars and practioners will begin to accept the teaching the all things are marked by impermanence, non-self and nirvana.&quot; His substitution of &quot;nirvana&quot; for &quot;suffering&quot; there may strike some as overly revisionist. He is arguing against a long-standing interpretation, and I am persuaded by his view.  Some of those thinking of buying this book, however, may not want such an individual perspective, and instead may be looking for a less critical summation of standard Buddhist teachings.<br /> That being said, this should be the standard reference on the basics of Buddhism in English.<br /> &quot;What are you doing?&quot;	2001-10-22
