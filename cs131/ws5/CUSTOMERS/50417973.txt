It hit on every possible cliche regarding behavior.  North is bad; south is good.  Money is bad; genteel poverty is good.  Homemaking good; career woman bad.  The heroine was a doormat, the hero a judgmental jerk.  The whole thrust of the story is that family should always be forgiven (no matter how awfully they treat you) and you should sublimate your ambition on their behalf.  I want my money back.	2002-05-29

Same jealously of someone else's marriage, same insecurity, same frantic dating.  Blah, blah, blah.  The ending of this book was predictable from the first chapter.   <br />Having said that, if the writing was good, I could have forgiven a recycled plot.  Sadly, it was not.  None of the characters are particularly likable -- frankly they are all charicatures.  Dialogue is stilted.  And the writing just isn't good.  Save your money for something better.	2001-11-13

Recently though I haven't enjoyed the novels as much.  I can't really put my finger on why.  <br />In any case, this was an okay read.  The premise was interesting, as was the glimpse into the married lives of the neighborhood.  But it never really grabbed my attention.  The characters were not particularly likeable.  You never really get to know much about Gretchen, so she isn't the most sympathetic of characters.  Graham seems kinda disconnected and oblivious about his wife's problems with his family.  There are hints as to his marital history and why he behaves the way he does, but frankly, this needed more development.  The ending for Graham and Amanda seemed abrupt and hurried.  Sort of a slapdash, happily ever after ending without actually working through their problems.<br />I guess I'm giving this 2.5 stars because I like Barbara Delinsky's work generally, and am not ready to give her work thumbs down.	2001-08-15

As Wes ships out on an assignment, he asks Bobby to go to Boston to look out for his younger sister, Colleen, who is doing stuff that has big brother in overprotective mode. Bobby goes, but is full of reservations because his feelings for Colleen Skelly are far from brotherly. As this is a serial romance novel, you can probably guess where the plot goes from there. <br />The dialogue is snappy and characters are very well drawn. The conversations between Wes and Bobby, as well as the brief appearances of other SEALs from earlier books work very well. <br />My only knock would be that we never learn much about Bobby's background and history. Normally I wouldn't notice this, but in all of the other Team Ten Books the heroes had a history that was explained, so its absense was noted here. <br />There is a good segue to the next book in the series (expected to be Wes' story) at the end. All of the Suz Brockmann fans who have been waiting impatiently for the next installment of her Team Ten books will be pleased with this effort.	2001-07-03

Sometimes the contents are just a little too bizarre, other times the plot and characters appeal.  Lately the novels have been not so appealing.  Angst over Jean Claude, who is manipulative; angst over Richard, the boy scout who can't get over his own monster-ness, blah, blah, blah.<br />Although rather gory, &quot;Obsidian Butterfly&quot; is probably the best Anita Blake I've read since &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;.

A character announces that she is four months pregnant.  Next chapter (marked &quot;Seven Months Later&quot;), she goes into premature (by one month) labor, according to dialogue spouted by another character.  Hello?

The Giambellis and MacMillans are two connected wine families who become further connected when the matriarch of the families, La Signora, decides to consolidate and reorganize the wineries.  As a part of the shake up, personal and professional alliances are broken and reformed, and new relationships are established.  Ty and Sophia, who think they already know each other, discover new facets to each other.  Pilar, Sophia's mother, learns new things about herself and her capabilities.  And the family learns something about revenge, betrayal and survival.  <br />Most Nora Roberts' fans will be pleased with this latest offering.  If it were a movie, I'd say it's worth full fare.	2001-03-20

The book was well written and well researched.  It gives a fascinating peek into the history of the American candy industry, as well as the competition between the two companies.  I'll never look at a Hershey's Kiss or a Snickers the same way again.  The editting could have been a little better -- some information was presented on several occasions and was redundant.

The plot was extremely predictable....so predictable, in fact, that I would have put the book down after the first chapter or so, but for the engaging style of Mr. Sparks.  The writing style kept my attention long after the plot itself lost my interest.<br />This is an okay piece of light fiction.  Good for a brief break or a bit of reading before falling asleep.  <br />This is far from the worst novel I've ever read, but after reading it, I'm not sure that I want to read Mr. Sparks other works.  I imagine that they will be about as predictable.	2000-09-21

So I am perhaps not the most judicious critic.<br />But this latest  installment is very well done, I think.  Don't want to give the plot away,  so I'll just say that the combination of professional problems and personal  issues are well defined and work together to make a fascinating story.<br />My  only criticism (which is not new) is that Roarke seems too perfect, almost  a cardboard cut-out of a hero.  And Dallas seems to always be apologizing  to him for who she is, while he goes along merrily interferring in her  cases and buying everything in sight.<br />I'd highly recommend this book to  all J.D. Robb fans.  To those who are new to the series, this is a good  book, but to really enjoy it, you should start reading at the beginning of  the series.	2000-09-12

But if the Jack Ryan series  continues this way, I'm going to have to stop reading.  There is entirely  too much time spent on the technical detail, with very little character  development.<br />Now that Jack Ryan is president, he isn't an underdog, which  was the basis of his appeal and heroism.  And frankly, there is too much  political opinion included with Ryan as president.  If I wanted to read  about political debate on issues such as gun control and abortion, I'd read  the newspaper or watch &quot;Meet the Press&quot; or some other news  program.  I read for entertainment, and Clancy's Ryan series has been  getting less entertaining in the past few installments.<br />Unless you are a  diehard Clancy fan, save your money for the paperback, or check this out at  the library.   And be prepared to be put to sleep by the technical details.	2000-08-28

I am happy to say that this is a better book  and worth the price.  &quot;Midnight Pleasures&quot; was a good read for a  rainy afternoon.  <br />The conflict between the main characters was  well-written, and the plot did not drag.  The primary fault I found with  Ms. James earlier novel was the irrational behavior of the hero.  The  hero's behavior in this case had a documented reason (which the reader  knows but of course the heroine does not), and was not as dramatic or  unreasonable.  There may be the minor inconsistancies that so irritated  other readers in &quot;PP&quot; but nothing that was glaring, I thought.   <br />All in all, not a bad read.	2000-08-13

Ms. Putney did not disappoint.  The romantic  tension between Kyle and Troth, and their conflicts with the restraints  placed on them by their families and cultures was well portrayed.  <br />The  only reason this book receives four stars rather than five is the end.  The  circumstances surrounding the death of Troth's father were only mentioned  once or twice in passing, and little was made of them.  The sudden action  at the end was out of place and unexpected...not unexpected in the way of a  good mystery, but just awkward and poorly explained or planned for in the  plot as a whole.  <br />But it was a good read, overall.	2000-08-07

This was standard Howard fiction, but somehow it just wasn't as good as I expected, given her past  work.<br />The dialogue between the main characters was snappy, and the  general plot was good, with a twist at the end.  My dissatisfaction stems  from the lack of character development and relationship development between  hero and heroine.  Jaine goes from hating her neighbor to sleeping with him  in the span of about 100 pages, with little contact, conversation or  interaction between the two of them.  And you get the feeling that you  don't ever really know what the neighbor, Sam, thinks or feels.<br />Not a bad  book, but one that I'd wait for in paperback before buying.	2000-07-28

Jemima seemed like a promising character, with flaws and good qualities.  Unfortunately, the novel never really developed to its full potential and fell prey to just about every  romance novel cliche around.  JJ was fat, therefore ugly, friendless,  without a social life and yearning for an unattainable man.  She becomes  obsessed with losing weight, obsessed with a guy who seems shallow (maybe  it's just that his character had little development, but I doubt it), and   addicted to an Internet relationship.  She loses her sense of humor, and  apparently her self-respect and all intelligence and goodsense as she loses  weight.  Automatically by losing weight she becomes desirable and sought  after.  <br />All novels are ultimately a brief escape from reality.  But this  one takes flight of fancy too far.  It reinforces unfortunate stereotypes  about weight, women, happiness, and ultimately says that if you lose weight  you'll be desired...even by someone who knew you when you were a better  (fatter) person.<br />I'd stick to Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes, Nick Hornsby  or Isabel Wolff.	2000-07-20

Neither the hero nor the heroine are endearing -- they are both caricatures with no personality to complete them.  Frankly, Father  Tom and Noah were the most interesting characters and they weren't around  enough to keep the plot from dragging.<br />I can't put a finger on exactly  what went wrong -- the book opened well.
