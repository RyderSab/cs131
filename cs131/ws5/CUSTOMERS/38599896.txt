I was shocked to see over a thousand reviews (mostly favorable) of this book that I had never heard of.  I was intrigued, although skeptical, since I usually found the fantasy genre to be sort of silly, what with its highly crafted covers and Dungeons and Dragons appeal.  I never fell into the group that was interested in that sort of thing, yet, being an open-minded person who was in search of a good fat read, I took the chance.<br /><br />Man, was I glad that I did!  It has been quite some time since I have had such an engrossing reading experience.  This book is filled with believable, likable (and despicable!) characters, and it is filled with well-thought out, multi-layered plots that will keep you interested until the last page.<br /><br />The book basically is about a land of seven kingdoms at a time in which there is political instability.  Its focus for book one is on the Stark and Lannister families and its multi-narrative point of view focuses on three different Stark members, a Lannister voice plus an additional voice from outside the kingdom.  The different narrative voices keep the pace of the story flowing, and you find yourself left wanting more as each chapter comes to a close.<br /><br />The book is filled with intrigue, mystery, humor, adventure, violence, sex, and much, much more.<br /><br />As a note, the other two books so far in the series build on this excellent debut.  Martin expands on his talents, showing a flair for exceptional characterization, and an aversion for black and white characters.  Just when you think you can determine whether a character is \\"good\\" or not, Martin throws a sucker-punch, and makes you see that people are not the binary opposites that this genre (and others) sometimes make them out to be.  The heroes are flawed, the villains have real, valid emotional sides that I found myself begrudgingly acknowledging, until, the line between hero and villain became erased commpletely, making this a saga about \\"real\\" people caught up in very turbulent times.<br /><br />As a student of \\"serious\\" literature, I admit that I scoffed at this genre without having read any of it, but George R. R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" Trilogy (soon to be a fourth) is as amazing a reading experience you are likely to have.  I'm just glad that I started the book when he already had three written!  I'm not sure I could have taken the wait between each installment if I had been on board from the beginning.line between hero and villain became erased commpletely, making this a saga about \\"real\\" people caught up in very turbulent times. <br /> <br />As a student of \\"serious\\" literature, I admit that I scoffed at this genre without having read any of it, but George R.

Like Watsons, \\"Bud, Not Buddy\\" focuses on a ten-year-old African American boy from Flint who learns about the value and importance of family.  The story opens as Bud is being moved once again from the orphanage where he has lived for the last four years (since his mother's death) off to a foster home (The Amoses).  His visit is short-lived with this family, given their abusive behavior, and soon after his departure, Bud decides to embark on an adventure to seek out the man whom he believes to be his biological father.  Like all stories about quests, our hero meets many people along the way who both hinder and help him towards his goal.  Surprises and twists meet him on his journey, and what Bud and readers finds in the end is reminiscent of \\"Oliver Twist.\\"  Set in the 1930s, younger readers may need some help understanding issues that come up like \\"Hoovervilles\\" and \\"labor unions\\", but overall, the story is humorous, and approachable for readers of ages 9 and up.<br /><br />Although Bud is faced with some difficult situations, Curtis avoids approaching them with sappy melodrama.  Instead, he looks at poverty, mourning, and hunger through the humorous eyes of a perseverant child, and again we are reminded of the skill with which this author is able break down important American moments and the people whom they affect.	2005-08-13

We are told of one summer in early 1950s, which lands our eleven-year-old narrator with Harris and his family, the Larsens, who are \\"shirttail relatives\\" and have willingly taken him under their wing to live on their remote farm.  The family consists of an \\"Aunt\\" Clair, \\"Uncle\\" Knute, fifteen-year-old Glennis, a sort of cousin, and her nine-year-old brother, Harris.<br /><br />Although younger and smaller than the narrator, nine-year-old Harris is a wild, rambunctious, hilarious scoundrel, and he quickly initiates the narrator in the ways of rural life, whether the initiation is welcome or not.  Each chapter in this book details a harebrained, yet inspired scheme that Harris concocts in order to make the farm a more interesting place to live.  Each page is filled with colorful language, vividly drawn characters, and laugh-out-loud moments.<br /><br />Perhaps in spite of the constant hilarity of each adventure the book resonates on a much deeper level as well, for the narrator, who has for his whole life been a rootless, wandering soul, with no one to care for him, finally finds a home in the most unlikely of places.  The humor and heart-string-tugging emotion of this book will resonate long after the last page has been turned.<br /><br />Highly recommended for readers nine and up!<br /><br />FYI:  Although the narrator remains unnamed in the book, this \\"novel\\" is rumored to be much more biographical than Gary Paulsen perhaps at time of publication wanted to be revealed.  Therefore, as I teach this book to a class of 7th graders, I remind them that we can simply refer to \\"The Narrator\\" as \\"Gary.\\"	2005-08-13

I don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />The Sixth installment of Rowling's wizarding series opens up with two prologue-type chapters that will blow Potter fans away, particularly the second chapter.  The pace and intrigue thus set from the beginning, the Sixth Year at Hogwarts is filled with twists and turns and surprises, some of which we had always sort of suspected.<br /><br />Harry begins his sixth year by trying to put the horrible death of Sirius behind him and come to face the prophecy given at the end of the last school year.  We meet in this installment the most matured and confident Harry yet (he is,after all 16).  In fact, all of the main characters, nearing the end of their seven-year run at the wizarding school, are much less the children they once were.  They have love interests, infatuation, break-ups, \\"snogging\\" (British term for making out) jealousies, and ambitions.  One wonders how the nine through twelve-year olds will take all of this budding adulthood. They even fret over the wizarding world's equivalent of driving lessons: apparition lessons, licenses for which may be given only after one has turned seventeen.<br /><br />Another reason to question the 9-12 set: There is blood aplenty, as well as floating corpses in a very scary scene. There is one scene in which a character is sliced open, causing blood to come pouring out, very vividly described by Rowling.  Attention Movie Moguls: Good Luck getting a PG rating on this one.<br /><br />All in all, it's a fantastically mature book that proves Rowling had much of this planned out way before she finished number one.  With each book, it becomes increasingly obvious that this series could have worked well as one complete book.  Additional warning: books six and seven tie together more than any other books in the series.  Translation: diehard fans will be awaiting the last book more than any other in the series.	2005-07-24

This particular foray into the past is about the mentally unbalanced son of the McCormick reaper fortune, whose illness pivots around his inability to get along in society with those of the opposite gender. Between his overbearing mother and his equally unbalanced and revealing older sister, Stanley's ideas of women are odd, to say the least.<br />While I read the book, I felt an urge to look up Stanley McCormick in the history books and find out how much is true about him. He is, however a rather flat character.  Yet, Stanley's longtime nurse, Eddie O'Kane, who follows his wealthy employer to California, the land of promise, of orange groves, of unlimited wealth (supposedly), is a much more interesting character. We are allowed to see inside Eddie's thoughts and are privy to his equally distorted views of women's place in the world.<br />Boyle layers his novel in three overlapping and related narratives.  First, there is the most &quot;current&quot; storyline, which begins with Stanley's departure from the east coast to the secluded family mansion (&quot;Riven Rock&quot;) of Santa Barbara, California.  This story unfolds before us, telling of the various doctors employed by Katherine, Stanley's still-young wife, who so badly wants to see her new husband well again, although to say &quot;again&quot; suggests that she has ever truly witnessed him in a sustained state of mental wellness.<br />Then, within this main storyline, is the background of the early years of Stanley and the unconventional courtship between himself and Katherine.<br />Finally, throughout the novel, including the first scene, we see events through O'Kane's eyes.  What is interesting about his perspective is that he is a drunk, a bigamist, a womanizer, and a deadbeat dad, yet one can't help but having mized emotions for him.  In fact, all of the novel's characters are neither heroes nor villains, as we are allowed to see them all their glorious imperfection and humanity.  It is O'Kane's story, though, that, for me was most rewarding, for it paralleled the misogyny and confusion in Stanley's life, seemingly saying that his treatment of women was by no means an isolated incident.fact, all of the novel's characters are neither heroes nor villains, as we are allowed to see them all their glorious imperfection and humanity.

Her name is Dinah, and her story is told in first-person narrative.  Much of the beginning is her mothers' tales, and its purpose is to set the scene and tone of the novel.  About halfway through an event occurs that sets this novel rolling.  It is an absolutely fascinating departure from other novels out there.  Diamant's choice to tell the female viewpoint from a minor character is brilliant.  I am no biblical scholar, either.

It's about a young adolescent named Adam on his way to see his father in another town.  He's riding his bike alll the way there.  There is something strange going on from the beginning, yet, we're not sure what.  In addition to this story, we're also seeing Adam being interviewed by a psychiatrist, supposedly after this bike ride has occurred.  It is an extremely well-done book, and many kids find it to be a favorite and want to read it over again as soon as they finish it.  Some get a little frustrated by it because they want very simple stories that require no thinking.  If you are like this, don't read this book--yet.  But come back to it when you are ready.  (It's sort of like \\"The Sixth Sense\\" because it has this shocker ending.  Very Cool.)<br />Parents/Adults:  If you're not familiar with this book, read it.  It can be enjoyable and challenging for readers of any age.  But, I suggest it for readers who are not easily frustrated and who seek challenging books.  7th grade and up.	2002-07-16

The author captures the inner workings of each of the three main characters, and keeps the suspenseful storyline rolling.<br /><br />Kids:  This is a pretty cool book.  Very suspenseful, but most of the action takes place in a bus full of children that is not moving.  It's standing still, while the kidnappers control the situation.  Therefore, much of the suspense is psychological, or in the heads of the three main characters.  Some who are expecting action-packed, shoot-em-up, Sczhwarzenegger-style stuff, might  be disappointed.<br /><br />Adults/Parents:  This is not a recommendation for the weak heart. There are deaths, as the title suggests.  I would suggest this book to 8th graders and up.	2002-07-16

I have read many books in my life, many of which I have made the grand statement that my life was altered afterwards.  None has had such an impact in such a short period of time. In the beginning of the book, Ms. Winston provides readers with a self-evaluation.  My wife and I sat down and did it together, and reluctantly added up our points.  We ranked in the &quot;Disorganized to the point of Chaos&quot; category.<br />But, in the past two weeks or so, we have begun to implement the author's suggestions, many of which boil down to common sense.  One reviewer is harsh in his criticism because of dated material, because of her suggestion to use carbon paper to make back-up copies of all correspondence.  I, too, was surprised at this anachronism in a newly revised edition, but I forgave her for all of the other great advice.

I picked up Brady Udall's first novel on a whim.  I often judge books by their covers, and this one, with its colorful, quirky photo seemed to advertise a book of the same qualities.  I was not disappointed.<br />&quot;The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint&quot; is one of the best books I've read in some time.  Very Dickensian in its structure, Edgar is something of an Apache Oliver Twist, an orphan with a heart of gold (mostly) who is set on hard times from the moment he takes his first breath.  The novel is filled with interesting (and sometimes lovable) characters, and an interesting and (as you might guess) meandering plot, in which these many characters are met along the way.  Similar also in tone to John Irving, the book has a black comic heart--- Edgar's skull-crushing accident at the hands of a mailman in the first line is something Irving might have constructed himself, and might possibly envy Udall for.<br />Finally, and most importantly, this guy can write.  Not just funny situations or laughably ludicrous characters, but some pages I found reading again or lingering on for the subtlety or beauty that Mr. Udall has created.  Overall, a great first novel.  I truly can't wait for another.  Let's hope Udall isn't that breed of writer that gets that one great work out of his system, only to disappear into a life of anonymity.	2002-07-13

I guess they can't all be fours and fives!<br />The story is told by an adult Ellen, middle child of the Van Bemmel family, who, it is obvious very early on, has suffered some sort of mysterious tragedy.  The writing which reveals the unfolding tragedy is pretty stunning in parts --- chilling even.  And even though it is fairly obvious WHAT the imminent disaster is, it is compelling to see how it all plays out in the narrative. They all live in a large home in the Netherlands, four children and the two parents, while awaiting the birth of a surprise fifth child.  Set in the 1970's, the parents run a &quot;clipping service,&quot; that specializes in American news and culture.  Their large home is taken up in large part by roomsful of filing cabinets of these various files.  This quirky backdrop for the story is an interesting one, and later ocurrences in the novel will leave you with your own thoughts as to how the Americana plays a role in the larger theme.<br />While my hopes were high through the first half of this suspenseful and often chilling novel, I became increasingly aware that Dorrestein's story is a bit too ambitious, and doesn't deliver enough for me to truly feel a strong connection with the story and its characters. My main beef with &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; is that I liked it so much that I wanted more --- I don't think it was given justice.  The family's tragedy occurs in the 1970's, yet we also have a storyline involving an adult Ellen and how this turn of events is still wreaking its havoc on her life.  We also have flashbacks into the early eighties, when Ellen is a teenager, as well as vignettes from early on in the story of Ellen's parents' courtship.  There was too much attempted here, with unsatisfactory results.<br />While many of my favorite novels are in the five-hundred-pages-plus range, I guess this thin book just didn't get into enough detail for me, considering the range of the story and the breadth of time being covered.h detail for me, considering the range of the story and the breadth of time being covered.	2002-05-09

Robert Lennon, we meet Tim Mix, whose father has just passed away and left his middle son nothing --- except the chance to humiliate himself, and possibly find out something in the process.<br />His father is the longtime cartoonist and creator of \\"The Family Funnies\\", which is uncannily like \\"The Family Circus\\" of the real funny papers.  The hitch is the fact that the Mix family is not the sweet and sugar-coated family  with the \\"aw-shucks\\" sense of humor as for many years portrayed in the patriarch's creation.  Instead, they are a good old fashioned American family of the twenty-first century---- that's right, disfunctional!  And it just so happens that the fact that Carl Mix (the creator) has frozen his children in time and has portrayed them as they perhaps never were.  In fact, he has alienated and angered each of the Mixes with his different portrayals of each in his skewed comic strip, even going so far as to skip one of his children altogether, never including him within its pages.<br />As if that doesn't make things bad enough, Tim Mix, the middle of the five children and failed artist, now just past the thirty mark, is left with the strip to continue in his father's absence. He immediately becomes angry and says no.  But, of course, he changes his mind, or else there wouldn't be a book.<br />There are many problems along the way, like the fact that he isn't a definite choice.  He needs to prove himself in the alotted ninetydays, lest the strip be given to a more able (and willing) artist.  Along the way, we also meet fictional versions of the creators of such strips as \\"Cathy,\\" \\"Garfield,\\" and \\"The Simpsons\\" (sort of).  A Fictional Charles Schultz is portrayed as an avuncular patriarch of all of cartoondom.<br />The book is very well-written and, throughout most every page, very funny, in a self-deprecatory way.  Tim Mix is a bit of a black sheep, along with his mentally unstable brother Pierce.  Each of the Mixes is different, and Lennon does a fantastic job in his characterization of each, as well as his dialogue exchanges between them.<br />For those of you who have read \\"The Light of Falling Stars,\\" Lennon has improved upon his narrative skills here, giving this reader at least a real reason to care about the characters.  It's no instant classic, but it's a very pleasurable read with a message embedded within about the blame that is appointed to one's family.and Lennon does a fantastic job in his characterization of each, as well as his dialogue exchanges between them.  <br />For those of you who have read \\"The Light of Falling Stars,\\" Lennon has improved upon his narrative skills here, giving this reader at least a real reason to care about the characters.

Ewan finds a baby abandoned in the bathroom of a bus station on the way to Mollie's, and before he knows quite what he's doing, he's boarding the bus with the baby in his arms, without having notified any authorities.  What is interesting is the events that follow, and the unraveling of the lives of the people who become affected by this baby.<br />The novel counld have just as well been called &quot;Greed&quot; because it is basically this fault that lies at the core of each of these characters.  Not necessarily all monetary greed, but also greed of the heart and (of course) greed of the loins.  The suspense is a subtle one, that builds slowly from the beginning and ends up as one might have suspected.  I found this to be the only fault, but perhaps it is not a fault at all, for while reading the novel, I felt as if I were a witness to a train wreck or some other human tragedy, peering through my fingers at what I suspect will inevitably turn out the way I'm afraid it will from the initial screeching of metal on metal.<br />As in many things in life, it is not the outcome that is necessarily interesting, but the journey on the way to that outcome.	2002-04-06

I thoroughly enjoyed this funny novel about the antics and political struggles of a struggling English department in a minor State college in rural Pennsylvania.<br />Upon first reading what the topic of the novel was, I thought, \\"who cares?\\"  But, Russo is a masterful storyteller, which, to me, means that he works magic with his charcters.  After a quick 400 pages, I was sorry to see them go.  The author does a fantastic job of building up the relationships so that you feel as if you understand the chemistry and history of these people, most of which have known one another for decades.  The humor in this novel is such that it springs from the characters themselves, not necessarily from plot alone. Instead, the humor builds and builds, until it reaches a crescendo, and you find yourself waking your wife from a dead sleep with your inane guffawing.  Then, just when, like the main character and narrator, Hank Devereaux, we believe everything to be a big joke, we find what we realized we knew all along... that there is a wonderful and tender heart beating at the core of this book.<br />Many times, if I read something I love by an author, I don't rush out and purchase previous works by him/her.  Instead, I accept that I've probably read enough and I should try another author.  Not with Russo.  I want more...I can't wait until Empire Falls is printed in paperback!!!	2002-04-05

This is none other than Herman Melville, who it is noted in the novel, lost his good literary reputation during his lifetime for the very work which continues to immortalize him --- Moby Dick.<br />Those of you who are familiar with Busch, most particularly his 1997 \\"Girls\\", will recognize that he is reworking many of his previous themes, as many authors tend to do. Busch again deals with a narrator with a past which he blames himself for, and seeks redemption for, and for which he (similarly) finds little. We've got the recurring theme of parental loss of a child, which Busch has dealt with several times.<br />As in Girls, we've got a narrator who we as readers will find that we have uncomfortably mixed emotions about.  Bartholomew is a character who we would like to like (love, even), yet the fact that his past haunts him...haunts us.  The book switches between post-civil war New York and Bartholomew's own experiences as a calculating, cold-blooded sniper.  The war scenes are the strongest in the novel, while the post-war scenes sometimes seem to have loose ends.<br />Overall, this book is, like \\"Girls,\\" exquisitely written, soulful, and resonates (with this reader at least) long after the last page has been turned. Busch's characterization and dialogue is some of the best I've read.  His books have perhaps never reached the status they deserve because in many ways they are too like life --- they are difficult at times and don't have easy solutions.  They require some work on the part of the reader.<br />It seemed to me, in the end, probably because I loved \\"Girls\\" so much, that \\"The Night Inspector\\" deserves a second read, not because I loved it so much, but because I'm not sure why I didn't love it enough.loved \\"Girls\\" so much, that \\"The Night Inspector\\" deserves a second read, not because I loved it so much, but because I'm not sure why I didn't love it enough.	2002-04-04

He is first seen as disturbingly different by his wet nurse, who is troubled by his lack of smell. He lacks no natural human odor whatsoever, an indication of other human qualities which he likewise lacks, like soul and emotion.<br />As we see him age in the short novel, we also witness the unfolding of Grenouille's lifelong quest --- to attain the most moving and powerful perfume, one which will have its effect on man, woman, and child alike.<br />In essence, Perfume is a murder story, as the subtitle suggests, yet other things are going on here. Suskind is investigating the intricacies of what makes us human, where our emotional frailties lie, our dependence on emotion (rather than logic), and the effect of mob mentality. This little horror novel is most compelling in the effect of its fairy-tale-like omniscient narration, and the fact that despite its being set very deliberately in a particular time and place, it truly could be read as being universal, like Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery,\\" which also has important lessons about being human, while masquerading as a grim horror tale.	2002-04-02

It was when Owen Meany originally was published in paperback that I first picked it up, not knowing too much about who John Irving even was, or what his work was like. I must have been just out of high school then. The armadillo on the cover was just strange enough to pique my interest.<br />Well, I can tell you, it has been about almost 15 years since then and I have been searching for a book to touch me and affect me as strongly as this one has. Its characters, its meandering plotline, its hilarity, and its emotional power place it in my all-time top five books thus far in life.<br />In the years since, I have found that whenever the topic of favorite books comes up, Owen Meany is a book that people throughout the country time and time again cite as their all-time favorite, for all of the reasons I mention here.<br /><br />Experience this book, and join its massive following!	2002-03-18

Some might even claim that Wells is riding on Twain's coat-tails here, because of the similar themes of race, the absent father, and the troublesome and misunderstood truant on the run from the law.<br />On the surface, there are a lot of similarities.  Yet, Wells has a knack for going in deeper, to see these American archetypes in a new light. Furthermore, Meely and his father have a relationship that would not be defined by any as being &quot;normal,&quot; yet, a true love is evident there, and it seems as if their relationship could not exist in any other form.<br />Read this book. You'll love it.	2002-03-10
US	38599896	R2YOAIZ0CJQIVG	044023512X	186149727	City of Light	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Fantastic Historical Fiction!	Belfer's debut novel is amazing in that it aspires to do so much --- and succeeds!  The author blends historical figures with fictional characters and does so seamlessly.<br />The novel focuses around Louisa Barrett, headmistress of a school for girls from elite families in Buffalo, New York. The book is billed as part murder mystery, part love story, yet it works on many different levels, the combination of which cannot be defined easily.  Louisa's tale unfolds somewhat slowly at times, and Belfer's research into the turn-of-the-century Niagra and Buffalo scene is evident, as her details sometimes become \\"skim-worthy\\".<br />Overall, however, the novel is a fascinating look at money, power, and one woman's struggle at self-definition.	2002-03-10

Peace Like a River is a novel which revolves around the main character, eleven year old Reuben Land, and his family's struggle to locate his brother, who is on the run from the law.<br />While sometimes Reuben's narration is inconsistent in voice and age, it is truly a delight to read, a wonderful mix of humor and pathos for the Land family's situation. Swede, Reuben's sister, is a great female character, echoing Harper Lee's Scout.  She's willful, poetic, strong, and engaging--- she alone is enough of a reason to read the book.<br />Some other readers have complained of its messiness, and the novel's unanswered questions, none of which I'll go into, for fear of giving away any of the story. While there do seem to be the occasional loose threads in the novel, overall, its uplifting narrative and hopeful message redeem the novel of all of its minor problems.  It is  a novel of spiritual awakening and human spirit that quite simply makes you glad that you're alive.	2002-03-10

I was actually surprised that it had won such a high honor, for I knew it only as the inspiration for a TV miniseries, of which I knew little and expected less.  So it was with trepidation that I began to read this western (a genre I don't frequently read), and I immediately was enthralled.<br />It is a huge book both literally and figuratively.  Rarely have I felt more affection for a cast of characters as I have for the ones in this series of books.  Isn't it characters we all read for anyway?? If that is what makes a book memorable for you, read Lonesome Dove today!!<br />You will never, EVER forget it.	2002-03-04
US	38599896	RQ1CW99WYCZR9	038550120X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Refreshingly Different	John Grisham is wonderful at writing Pot-Boilers which Hollywood just happens to love.  His knowledge of law and his imagination have catapaulted him into success ever since The Firm.  What we didn't know (but always suspected) was that Grisham can transcend his familiar genre and still work his magic.<br />Told in the voice of a small boy on a cotton farm in the 1950's, A Painted House is a wonderfully told novel that I really enjoyed. While the story has a compelling pace and plot, it may not satisfy the hard-core Grisham fans.  There is, indeed, no courtroom scene.  I kept bracing for certain storylines to evolve into full-blown, Grisham-esque thrillers, but was pleasantly surprised when they did not.<br />There's a quiet little corner in Grisham's heart, a little Kent Haruf.  If you have that in you, read this book.  You'll find it resonates a lot longer than most of his blockbusters.	2002-03-04

Frederick Busch, a prolific writer who has written over a dozen works since the 1970's does a wonderful job of telling the story of Jack, a Vietnam vet, who is struggling with the loss of his daughter, and the gradual loss of his marriage.  Jack is a compelling character, with a wonderful narrative voice.  There is a mystery of dead/missing girls which Jack gets wrapped up into, and yet, there is so much more here, like the healing process which Jack so needs to experience.<br />If you're looking for a pure thriller/mystery about missing girls, then look elsewhere.  If you want a richly layered novel with believable characters, a great plot, and with some unexpected surprises thrown in, READ THIS.  I, personally, have just purchased two new Busch novels, and I can't wait to see how they stack up with Girls.	2002-03-04

Here's yet another example of an absolutely wonderful book which was never followed up by any others from this author.  The Secret History is a mystery of sorts, even though you start off the novel knowing much of it.  It is the unravelling of details (and characters' lives!) which is absolutely fascinating.  This is one of those few books which I tend to urge people to read, even after fifteen years or so of its publication.  It still resonates.	2002-01-06

Two widowed sisters, one blind, the other a bit of an alcoholic, they are on a cross-country automobile ride.  It sounds simple and trite, I know. There are mishaps along the way, many of which you might be able to guess at, yet this sweet pair of women is truly engaging and Charles Dickinson deserves more attention for the work he's done.	2002-01-05
