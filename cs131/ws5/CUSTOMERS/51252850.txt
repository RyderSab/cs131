I was not sorry I did, from the first page to the last.  I am a very strong believer that everyone should learn their countries history, from the beginning to the present.  Mr. McCullough certainly gives us an enjoyable way of learning a small, but important part of ours!  The year 1776 was the lowest point of our war for independence for the men and women who struggled against seemingly insurmountable odds.  We of course know that in the end, they did win out against these improbably odds.  This should give all of us encouragement and hope.I also must admit that my admiration for General Washington rose quite a lot.  He, Washington, has taken some hard hits lately over the fact that he was a slave owner.  It must be remembered that he was a product of his times and was acting accordingly.  I am quite sure that in two or three hundred years, we, as a society will take our share of criticism after being viewed through the scope of our coming history.  The author's  narrative was wonderful and he certainly performed some meticulous research.  I do feel that for the reader to get the most of this work, it would certainly be an advantage to know a bit of American History in reference to before and after this particular time period.  But then again, it is not absolutely necessary to thoroughly enjoy this work.  There is nothing of the text book flavor about this book and it holds the readers interest from front to back.  I highly recommend this one and in fact, recommend it as an addition to your library as you will no doubt want to give it a reread on down the road.	2005-10-13

First let me say that this is one of those series (10 books in all) that must be read in order.  Not one of these stories can be read as a stand-a-lone.  That is fine by me.<br /><br />This particular work of course takes up the story precisely where King of the Murgos, the previous book, laves off.  The entire crew; the crew we have become very familiar with continues to search for Garion's lost son and their journey leads them once again into strange lands and equally strange situations.<br /><br />At this point in the series the author of course, sticking with his normal formula, has become rather repetitive and much material from the previous books is being recycled again and again.  Each character stays true to the author's initial introduction and we find more and more stories which are being retold with slight adjustments here and there.<br /><br />Now this is one of those works you either like or dislike.  I personally have read the entire series more times than I care to admit to here in print.  These books are my \\"relaxing\\" books.  They are pure escapism.  I like that.  I enjoy the humor and banter between the characters and even though even the first time reader can pretty well figure out where the plot is headed, they are still enjoyable.  No, at first glance these are not the best and greatest fantasy books every written - (Although, if you check it, Eddings has introduced several elements in this series which have been a major influence in Fantasy/Quest stories which still linger with us to this day), but for me, that does not matter...hey, I enjoy these thing and will continue to read them between the books I normally read.  As I said, these books help me relax.  They are a known quantity to me and to the quite frank; I can enjoy them without having to stretch my mind too far.<br /><br />I suggest you read the first couple of books in the series (It does not take that long) and if you enjoy them, then continue.  If you hate the things....well, drop them right there as the go on and on and on.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksot take that long) and if you enjoy them, then continue.

The writing was real and very well done.  From the first page, I was hooked.  This is one of the better first hand accounts of this war I have read.  The author has wonderful recall of events and make them pop out and come alive with his narrative.  I should think this would make a wonderful \\"how to\\" book for first person writers.  The author is always quite realistic in his discriptions of events and places.  Not only is his story inspiring, it is quite informative and I do recommend you add this one to your collection for a reread..I know I did.  Highly recommend.	2005-10-07

I have always enjoyed Kirk Douglas the actor and was pleased that I was able to enjoy Kirk Douglas the autobiographor.

This is the second to the last in \\"The Malloreon\\" and takes our friends through previously covered ground and into new.  While the character developement is rather stinted, Eddings never-the-less packs a lot of action into each chapter the the story keep moving at a nice brisk pace.  There are a couple of nice, predictable twists and some not so predictable.  All in all, Eddings fans will enjoy the work.  Those who are not fans probably won't.  Either way, if you have read this far into the series, why stop now?  All in all, recommend.	2005-10-07

The author is a good teller of stories and her plot line held my interest to the end.  Like several other reviewers, I did find the many, many, many characters quite confusing at times, but once into the rhythm of the work, found I could handle it.  The author probably overused obscenities here and there.  I do have friends that are just as bad in real life, but not everyone!  I felt character development was good even though some of the characters were not overly endearing.  This is an interesting work and I certainly am not sorry I read it.  Perhaps it is not for everyone though...each of us has their own taste.	2005-09-24
US	51252850	REQN8O51GLVDW	0345467337	351900345	Running with the Bulls: My Years with the Hemingways	Books	4	7	10	N	N	A VERY MIXED REVIEW	This is yet another \\"I knew Hemingway when\\" story.  As my title states, I have mixed feelings and opinions about this one.  The first portion of the book, where the author is actually with Hemingway and his wife at the time, Mary, is interesting and somewhat informative.  It is always interesting (for me anyway) to pick up tidbits of the life of this author, i.e. E. Hemingway.  After the death of Hemingway the book sort of goes into a bit of a decline.  Some of the interactions with Mary Hemingway were interesting and indeed the horrible, sad story of her marrage (the author's) to Greg Hemingway was, while not facsinating, at least interesting, in a voyeuristic sort of way. I do have several problems with this work though.  First, the author is by far one of the most profilfic name droppers I have ever read.  This is okay I suppose, but in this work she really goes over the top.  In addition (probably, no doubt, due to my complete lack of sophistication), I had no clue who 90 pecent of these people were and, in all truth, could care less. Secondly, the author is simply not consistent, even in matters concerning her own life.  She goes from being a simple little Irish girl, to an ultra sophisticated world traveler who is wise in the way of literater, back to being a simple little Irish Girl, over and over and over again.  Third, the author seems to hesitate to speak of anything remotely personal and intimate in dealing with E. and Mary Hemingway as if she does not want to break a trust.  Hey, they are dead - most of the family is either dead or insane!  The writing of this book alone broke a trust, per author's own admission, so why not be a bit more detailed?  The book is an obvious effort to make a buck (no hard feelings there, I would have done the same, only earlier), so why not go into a bit more depth?  That being said, I am glad I read this work and glad it was written.  I just feel it could have been so much more and so much more informative.  It did give me more information concerning the life of a great author. For that I am grateful.more information concerning the life of a great author. For that I am grateful.	2005-09-17

This forth volume of Durant's work certainly lives up to it's predecessors.  Starting in the early part of A.D. 300 and continuing to the time we know as the Renaissance, this 1086 page work is not only a lesson in history, but a sheer delight to read.  I must admit at this point to being a very big fan of Durant's work, in particular his series \\"The Story of Civilization.\\"  I am not a professional historian by any means, therefore cannot abolutely say that all of his facts are absolutely correct.  I can say though, that of the literally hundreds of text I have read, these are by far the best..certainly the most readable. Durant's prose is that of a master story teller.  I will leave it up to the academics to pick and fuss over each period and comma.  I doubt seriously though, that few, if any of them, could equal the magnitude and scope of this work and then, on top of it all, have so many, many people read their work and actually enjoy it!  This particular work addresses the three religions which are at the forefront of our western world today, Christian, Islamic and Judaic.  This is a history we must know in order to survive the world as we know it.  This work goes along way in giving us some understanding of how these religions have shaped us into what we are today.  Recommend this one highly and recommend you add it to your collection.	2005-09-16

It was interesting and certainly adds another layer to the mound of Hemingway \\"I knew him well\\" literature. I felt the book was worth reading, but do feel that other biographies, by other author's and acquaintances should be read as well, in order to get a full picture of the writer and man Hemingway.  By the author's own admission, this is a work of admiration and should be read as such.  More and more we are finding the existence of the phenomenon of there being more interest in Hemingway the man, rather than Hemingway the author, or, I should say, Hemingway's works.  This is okay by me as I probably fall into that category more and more as the years go by.  This work gives us yet another view of Hemingway the man. The writing is good and holds the reader's interest.  I am not at all sure of the accuracy of some of the facts found in this work as they do not agree with other biographers. In light of the reason this book was written, perhaps these inconsistencies should be overlooked.  After all, this is not hard core history we are talking about here.  All in all I recommend if for a pleasant read, a way to pick up more knowledge of Hemingway and should certainly be added to your Hemingway collection.	2005-09-13

The author has done his research and has presented his material in a manner which is not only quite readable, but quite informative.  I do like the way Prof. Watts has given us numerous examples of his sources, i.e. different publications, speeches, news paper articles, etc.  The author has given us both the good and the bad of Henry Ford, and we find that the subject of the book, Henry Ford, is much like all of us...both good and bad.  I did enjoy and appreciate the fact that the author does not seem to have a particular social or political ax to grind, but rather gives us the facts and gives credit to the reader's ability to make up his or her own mind.  This is refreshing. Far enough time has passed so that now historians can make some judements and obervations as to the overall impact and ramifications of the actions taken during the Ford years, by both Ford and his contemporaries, have upon our society today.  Not until recently have historians been able to do this.  Mr. Watts has done a wonderful job of this.  Recommend this one highly.  Thank you Prof. Watts for some obvious hard work.	2005-09-12

I began attempting to grow orchids in my home a number of years ago.  After making an absolute wretched mess of things and killing many a beautiful plant, I happened upon this book.  It is one of the best purchaces I've made concerning this art, i.e. growing orchids.  I must admit to having read this thing cover to cover and find myself constantly going back with each new purchase or gift of a plant.  I simply could not grow the things without it!  The text is quite understandable and the illustrations are concise and fit perfectly with the text. I do respectfully disagree with some other reviewers in that I actually found many of the black and white photos more helpful than color.  If I wanted a book of pretty pictures I would buy it, or better yet attend one of the many, many orchid shows in the area.  I wanted, and desperately needed hard information...with this book that is exactly what I got. I am sure there are other very good books out there on this subject, but this one certainly met my needs and I recommend it highly.  Thank you Ms. Northen.	2005-09-07

I admit to being one of those who, while aware of this period in our history, actually knew little of it and the impact it had on future events.  What little I have read tended to be \\"soap box\\" history, that is, work that tried to make either the English or French or Native Americans into either saints or complete animals.  This book gives us a rather different slant and pretty well makes the point that \\"times were hard then.\\"  I feel this work goes far in making an attempt to show all sides of the issue, both the good and bad of all the participants.  If you are looking for a politically correct, \\"gosh what animals they were,\\" then this one is probably not your cup of tea.  Actually the author has not made any one side look all that nice and civilized.  There has never been a war where atrocities were not committed.  Further more, there has never been a war where the atrocities were not committed by all sides, to one extent or another.  This war was no different.  The work is well written and is apprently quite well researched.  It is very readable.  Recommned this one for any history buff and in particular for those interested in the early history of this country.  Recommend you purchase and add this one to your collection.	2005-08-27

This is number thirteen in the series and is certainly not up to the good read the first several books were.  I rather think I agree with the other reviewer here in that I suspect that this was, at least in part, written by someone other than the author, i.e. Sadler.  The story seems rather thrown together and almost follows some sort of formula.  Certainly the spirt of Casca was not there.  On the other hand, reading it did me no real harm, it was kinda fun, and only took a couple of short sessions.  Recommend it simply as it is a part of the series, but don't expect too much out of this one. On the other hand again, it is still far, far better than the recent two attempts by the publisher to bring back Casca.	2005-08-23

Sadler blends history with action and in this one even throws in a love interest.  It is one of the sadder episodes in the Eternal Warrior's story but hold to Sadler's original story line and style.  Like any of the Casca books, I do not read them for any great literary enlightenment, but rather to be entertained by a good story from a good story teller.  This work fills that bill perfectly.

It is the job of the writer, i.e. story teller to bring a mood to a story.  The writer's words should, if done well, bring out emotions.  Ms. Haigh has done just that with this novel.  The entire book, for me, was quite depressing.  That is good.  It shows that the author did her job and struck a note that I am sure she was shooting for.  If the other reviews here are any indication, I am not alone with this emotion as others found the same feelings in reading this work.  The subject matter alone is enough to get one down.  I cannot say I enjoyed this work, but then again, not all stories are written to make one happy.  I cannot recommend this one for those who are looking for a \\"happy book\\" but can recommend it as a story well written in which the author accomplished just what she set out to do.	2005-08-19

I do recommend it for the mature reader though. This is not a typical Judy Blume work.  This is a tale of a woman and a sexual odyssey.  The books is absolutely hilarious at times, and sad in others.  I suppose the sad part is that I know of a goodly number of women that it could actually be about.

I admit to being partial to firsthand accounts of historical happenings and the author certainly gives us a wealth of those in this work.  This is a rather easy read since there are no orders of battle involved, only personal stories and how it effected the people who were actually there.  I do agree with the one reviewer who suggested this work be read after other, more technical accounts of the battle have been studied as the reader will probably have a greater appreciation for what is found in this book. Goodness knows there are enough of those about and the reader will have no problems in finding several very good works out there.  On the other hand, it is certainly not absolutely necessary.  This three days was one of the pivotal points in our countries history and the more we understand it, the more we understand ourselves.  We find in this work that the folks of that time were no much different that us and for some reason this is a comfort to me.  I collect books concerning the Civil War and this is certainly a work that is treasured among my many volumes.  I recommend it highly.	2005-08-07

This particular book brings us back to the beginning of the first book when Casca is brought into the hospital and the tale begins.  Now I will grant you that Sadler will never be up up for any big literary awards, but this story, like the other stories in the series are simply fun to read.  They are true page turners for those who enjoy this genre.  Actually, when you examine the facts Sadler spikes his book with, it is quite clear that he has done his home work.  After Mr. Sadler passed away, the publisher has attempted to contine the series with a couple different authors.  Those stories are a complete waste of time and paper.  Stick with the Sadler written books.  All in all I recommend this one highly.	2005-08-02

Well written and well researched, it is not only a very good history of a terrible time in our nations history, but a stiring story of one man and the difference one man can make.  It is difficult to imagine the mental discipline involved in the situations the marine found himself involved.  All in all this is a well written book.  It gives a down and dirty insight to just what goes on in any war.  I highly recommend.	2005-08-02

Secondly, I am not a big Chuck Norris (the actor) fan. (Note:  On the other hand, I do admire very much Chuck Norris the man, and his many, many accomplishments and the way he has lead his life).  Those two things being said, I was very surprised at the usefulness of this particular book.  The writing is quite simple, easy to understand and Mr. Norris certainly has some wonderful advice to share.  I do agree with another reviewer in that Mr. Norris has obviously been influenced by another writer of some twenty years ago.  this is okay though.  I know of absolutely no writer in history that has not been influenced in someway by those who proceeded him.  Why should Mr. Norris be any different.  This work, my Norris is a much easier read than some of the other works in this field and I feel could probably be more understood by the younger reader.  Overall I recommend this one highly.	2005-08-02

That being said, I enjoyed this third volume of Durant's life work just as much as the other volumes.  Durant has the ability to make even the mundane colorful and interesting.  Unlike many detailed works of history, the author's style is is more prose than technical rat-a-tat.  By the time you finish this volume, you have a pretty good feel of than time and era.  No history book can cover it all, but if this volume is read for what it was meant to be, a overview (a detailed one though), it is one of the best in it's genra.  I highly recommend this one and the rest of this author's work.	2005-08-02

This is though, some of the best writing, erotic and non-erotic, you will find.  The writer approaches the subject with great passion, and there is no way you cannot appreciate her use of words.  I enjoyed and think quite highly of the author's Little Birds, but I do feel she probably does even a better job with this one.  If you buy one of the works, you might as well go for both of them as each belongs in your collection.  Recommend this one highly.	2005-07-31

I approach books such as this with caution.  First and foremost, I do not feel that a serious analysis can be written of any event until quite a number of years have passed and we can see what the results of a particular person or event had over the long haul.  Secondly, I absolutely have no use for \\"hate\\" biographies or biographies written by authors who have some sort of personal or political axe to grind.  That is simple bad scholarship and goodness knows we have enough of that crap lurking around us.  That being said, I must admit to have been very pleasantly surprised with this offering.  I felt the author did a very good job of giving us a ballanced view of the Clinton years in power.  Now, this book, as others have so well pointed out, is not a deep book, it is rather, a primer and should be read as such.  Over the next 20 years or so I have no doubt that some wonderful works will be written on the Clinton's and the Clinton years.  This work is a good start.  It gives a good ballanced overview and is a wonderful starting place.  I gets you ready for what I am sure will come.  You will be disappointed if you are looking for a juicy gossipy read or a Bill and Hilary basher.  The author is quite good about giving both sides of each issue, both personal and politically.  He examins both the dark side and the light (such as we know of it today).  Recommend you read this one, but do recommend you not stop with this one.	2005-07-30

I first \\"discovered\\" these books when I accidentally purchased the entire first edition set in a box of books at an auction.  It was the best dollar I ever spent.  Mr Grayson takes us to a day and time that we have overlooked.  His keen observations are as valid today as they were when the author first published.  I value these books as they give yet another lens to view life through thereby making life much richer.  Recommend this work, and Grayson's other works highly.	2005-07-25

Written and released in 1980, the information found between it's covers is timeless.  I will grant you that some of the advice this husband and wife team pour into the book amy seem a bit \\"hokey\\" in this day and age, but trust me, there is a lot of truth here.  Much of what is found here is pure common sense, but like most things, sometimes we needed reminded of the things we know to be true but have simply forgotten in the process of grinding our way through life.  This book is like a gentle shake, a gentle splash of water in the face.  I highly recommend it.	2005-07-25

I have to admit that I fell in love with the young lady in the story at the time.  The story is of a young women, an indentured servant, who runs away and simply makes her own way in the American wilderness of that day and times.  The story is well told.  Yes, it was written for and meant to be a juvenile book, but I was luck enough to run across a copy recently, read it again, and still found it charming.  I must admit that I found I still had a bit of a crush on her.  Recommend this one highly, if you can find a copy.	2005-07-25

It is far more than simply a book of \\"baseball war stories.\\"  The interview clearly illuminates the personality of one of the greatest baseball players who ever lived (beyond a doubt the best pitcher).  There was much more here, to this man than just a great arm.  The author captures Paige's somewhat erratic personality.  The man, Paige, was certainly a character and much more that a simple \\"jock.\\"  On the other hand, reading between the lines, there is a whimsical sadness ever present.  As you read, you cannot help but wonder what might have been had the times been different.  You get the feeling that Paige knew, ergo, the sadness.  Recommend this one for any baseball fan or those simply interested in or countries history, warts and all.	2005-07-18

Each time I read this wonderful novel I am even more impressed than the last time.  This work has some of the best character developement I am aware of.  It is a absolute delight for no other reason than this.  Of course the book gives us a wonderful picture of the South during the 1930s.  I actually feel that you can and will appreciate this work more had you lived during that time and in that area.  This work was no \\"required reading\\" when and where I went to school, which is a pitty.  It is a work more people should be exposed to.  I do note, through reading these many reviews here, that there is a direct relationship between the age of the reader and the appreciation of the book.  I am not at all sure the younger reader (and I do not mean this as a put down) can truely appreciate this particular work until they have been around the block a few times, both in life and in literature.  I think there may have to be a certain maturity reached before the appreciation can be reached.  This is true of so many things.  Had I read this in my early teens or late teens, I am not sure I would have like it all that well myself. That being said, I do feel that any reader will be much richer, in the long run, for having read this work.  I highly recommend.	2005-07-15

Written in the late 70s, this is a wonderful book to use for your childs nature study and if you have no children, then it is just a very fun and informative work to spend a rainy Saturday with.  It is well reasearched, written in a very readable style and is just chucked full of wonderful little tidbits of information.  It certainly gives you a greater appreciation for, what at first glance, is a rather lowly  creature.  I picked this one up at a used book sale and am grateful I did.  Recommend it for anyone interested in nature or anyone with an inquisitive mind.	2005-07-15

This is one of those works that sort of draws a line in the sand as to American Literature.  As you will note from the various reviews, folks either love or hate this particular book.  I first read this work as a very young man, with the attitude of a youth in the 1950s and 1960s.  My view of that work was completely different than my view during a recent reread, having reached geezerdom.  Having traveled a few of the roads that the narrator, Sal, traveled, in more ways than one, I can say that the author hit pretty close to the mark in most areas.  That being said, I must admit that my recent reading brought a great sadness on me, more for the author himself, rather than that of the so called \\"beat\\" generation.  Most of the beats finally grew out of it.  I have the feeling the author never did. That to me is sad.  The work though, is good if you like this particular style.  The author does hit upon and well expresses several truths and I feel he does give a voice to that era which hits the mark pretty well.  This is one of those works, much like Catcher in the Rye, that really should be read, if only for the expierence.  It is always nice to taste different foods even though, after finishing, you might tell yourself \\"never again.\\"  All in all I highly recommend this one.  Read it and pass your own judgement.	2005-07-15

I have read most of the books in this particular series and continue to be impressed.  The author is certainly a very good story teller.  With her work we get history, humor, good discriptive details and likable characters.  This particular work takes place outside of O'Shea's normal residence, but it still has all the charm of her small town in Missouri.  I guess I am rather fascinated with this author's work.  These books are most certainly \\"cozy chick books,\\" not something that can normally hold the interest of a 60 plus year old ex-military man who reads more biographies than anything else.  But...there is something about them (MacPherson's books) that is quite relaxing, the writing is good and I am grateful to my wife for insisting that I read the first one.  I would have missed a lot had I not listened to her.  I would be curious to know why this particular author has not branched out into other genre.  Her story telling abilities and command of the language are at least as good as those of Elizabeth Moon and Anne McCaffrey (two of my favorite in the fantasy genre).  Anyway, I highly recommend this one for a very enjoyable read and hope we have many more like it coming down the pike.	2005-06-25

I did enjoy this book.  It was light reading and held my interest throughout.  I am partial to the area of the world it took place, so I suppose that made it more enjoyable for me. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the story line was reasonable, and for a short work, thought the character developement was pretty well done.  I will quite likely read more of her work.	2005-06-24

As with the other Torie O'Shea<br /><br />Mystries, we have a mixture of history, mystery, domestic life in a small town and humor.  This novel moves fast and has some nice twists.

It is one of those works that once started, is difficult to put down.  This work, like many other works by this author certainly falls into the category of \\"classical SiFi\\" books of our times.  Like several other reviewers though, I do find the ending to the book rather unsatisfactory.  On the other hand, this is typical Heinlein and is to be expected. The author, per usual, gives us good character developement and you certainly cannot fault his story line.  I suspect devoted Heinlein fans will probably enjoy this one more than those less enthusiastic as to his, Heinlein's, overall work.  All in all I highly recommend this one.  Nice, enjoyable read.	2005-06-16

Not only is it well written, in a Victorian way, but it is a very nice \\"dirty book\\" to boot.  There is never really anything crass or gross in the book, the author's use of the language sees to that.  The story is certainly realistic, there is humor and a certain sadness all at one time.  I am old enough to be able to remember when this particular work was not available in the United States.  Thank goodness those days are over.  We did miss a lot of purely good writing in those days.  I am not at all sure if this one is appropriate for a High School Lit. class, but is certainly worth the read and the study for the more mature reader.  On the other hand, the work is certainly a lot less graphic than some of the material the kids have ready access at any time.  All in all I have to recommend this one.  It is interesting and certainly gives us a good lesson in writing.	2005-06-16

Character developement was wonderful and the story or stories held my interest throughout the book.  I read the review by Publisher's Weekly on this one, as as per usual, I am not real sure the reviewers even bothered reading the book.  Where on earth to they find these people to do their reviews?  Anyway, this is certainly one of those books that should not be judged by it's cover.  My one and only complaint is that the cover and the quote on the front of the book are quite misleading.  This is not a typical cozy chick book, full of crumpets, tea and the like.  It is a rather good collection of character sketches and situations that go far beyond.  Had not my wife first read the book and recommened it, I probably would not have given it a second glance.  Thank goodness for an alert wife! The writing is quite uncomplicated and quite readable.  The stories are interesting and intertwine in a wonderful way.  There is some bitter sweet sadness to some of the stories which is off set by some hilarious situations.  If you are looking for a good, simple read about outwardly simple people, then this is for you.  If you are looking for a cookbook and pages and pages of descriptions of various food groups and tea settings, then you will probably be a bit disappointed.  All in all I recommend this one highly and certainly, like a couple of the other reviewers, would like to see more of the same from this author.  Thank you Ms. Owens.	2005-06-13

Like most of Sheldon's books, the reader is taken to places and shown this which are a far cry from most of our lives.  The story here is fast moving and can certainly be classified as a thriller.  When I set down with one of this author's books, I am not searching for a Hemingway, Steinbeck or Williams.  I want a good story which entertains me.  This is far better than numbing my mind with reruns of sitcoms on TV.  Mr. Sheldon fills this bill nicely.  While I certainly cannot recommend a complete diet of this particular author's work, or his ilk, I do find a good story refreshing and simply fun.  Highly recommend this one.	2005-06-09

This book is now often overlooked, which is a shame as it is a well written piece of literature.  This is the touching story of a typical mountain family during the depression years.  I enjoy rereading this one ever so often, near Christmas.  It is not a lengthly tale, it is one you can read on a snowy Saturday (get you in the mood).  This is also a well crafted book, told my a master story teller. The author's character developement is absolutely wonderful.  I hate to use the word \\"classic\\" as I feel it is quite over used, but with this work I am tempted.  It is certainly a book you should add to your list.	2005-06-09

I am not sure how they did it from this work, but hey, the series was not all that bad, I suppose.  The book though is one of those that will stick with you.  It may not the best SiFi out there, but it certainly can be classified as a classic and it is more than worth the read.  I must admit to have given this one a couple of reads over the years (the first was in 1980) and am still rather fascinated with the story (read other reviews for plot, etc.).  If you like a good story, one that may, to some taste, be a bit over the top, then this one is for you.

TOlkien.  It is a very ballanced biography, and does indeed point out a few of the short comings of the author, but this is well and good as it is not a chop job of the author and certainly points out strong points far more than his bad.  This was one of those biographies I was unable to put down once I started it.  I have always held Tolkien's work in very admiration, and this was sort of icing on the cake.  Being one of the better authors of the past century, I is good that we have works such as this so that we can get to know the man as well as the man's works. I first read this one over twenty years ago, enjoyed it then and recently enjoyed it again.  I highly recommend.	2005-06-09

Mr. Mowat has given us a vivid first hand account of his expierences during WWII and this book ranks at the top of such works.  Not only do we get a first hand view of the actual fighting (found in many/most accounts), but we also see the other side of the war.  The horrible loneliness and boredom.  Mr. Mowat is an acute observer of human nature, something he uses with a cutting edge in this book.  For this amature historian of this period, and those just passingly interested, this is a good read and I highly recommend it.	2005-06-09

The author has been rather meticulous in presenting his source data, something that is always appreciated, and more often than not these days, not at all well done.  Thank you Mr. Kater for that.  While the average reader (that includes me) may find most of this book to be a bit on the dry side, it never-the-less is certainly worth the extra effort it may cost to read through it.  This is an area little understood, and surprisingly very little is known of it.  It is an area we should all pay very close attention to.  It would be a horrible shame to look into a mirror and find ourselves there one day.  Back to the book though.  I would have personally liked to have seen more first hand account from the rank and file, i.e. exmembers of this group.  As it stands, the author has used memories of what I feel are too many academic types who have obviously spent years formulating their thoughts on the subject.  I sort of wonder what the \\"grunt\\" that remained a \\"grunt\\" after the war, now feels.  What are their thoughts and feelings?  This is just me though, and perhaps that would add little to the subject.  All in all I highly recommend this one, for both students of this era and for those simply interested.	2005-05-29

It is far removed from my world culturely, geographically and philosophically.  That is okay though.  This little book is a true pearl.  Each chapter is a wonderfully crafted sketch of various members of an elite New York family, starting just before the Civil War.  Mr Auchincloss certainly has a wonderful command of the language and is certainly a true story teller.  This is one of those books that you can read sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph and relish each and every one, almost as a separate entity.  I found the writing style easy on the eye and mind and the entire flow of the book was true to itself from beginning to end.  A wonderful read and I highly recommend.

The author simply has the ability to put into words what most of us felt and knew. This is one of those stories that will stick with you, and will certainly dredge up old memories and feelings. Mr. McAuliffe is certainly a natural story teller, has a wonderful command of the language and is quite consistent from the first page of his work to the last. I do feel that the book will be more appreciated by those who served in the military during those horrible times than by those who did not. It is true, as other reviewers have pointed out, that Mr. AcAuliffe has used the vernacular to those times. I personally feel the story could not be told with true feeling with out it's usage. On the other hand, works such as this will quite possibly add to the understanding of that time and place. Each generation has it's own war to remember and to \\"get over\\" and works such as this are bound to help in both areas. I highly recommend you purchase this one as you will want to add it to your collection. It is well worth a second read and well worth passing along to the younger generation. Read it...you will not regret it. I must say that books such as this which are published by small publishing houses are often overlooked (shelf space is hard to come by) and this is truely a shame. Many of our great regional authors are overlooked in the shuffle for the dollar. I truely hope this is not one of those..what a loss to all of us that would be.	2005-05-28

This is certainly not one of those \\"happy\\" stories which seem to fill our shelves in all the book stores, nor it it one of those which leave us completely without hope.  Thoughtful, sensitive and well done.  Recommend you add this one to your reading list.	2005-05-17

My to be read list includes books that were published 150 years ago...books I want to read but alas, authors keep turning them out faster than I can read them.  As with many books (and the list grows) I am about a day late and a dollar short of this one but that did not distract from my reading pleasure one bit.<br /><br />I like novels written by Tami Hoag.  She is an excellent writer and an excellent story teller.  The book being reviewed here, ‘Kill the Messenger’ is no different.  I enjoyed this one cover to cover.<br /><br />A young messenger boy is caught up in a web of murder an intrigue and finds himself not only the suspect in a brutal murder but also the target of an apparent stone cold killer.  While at first it was difficult for me to grasp the essence of characters as they were introduced the story never-the-less sucked me in and the more I read the faster I found myself turning the pages.<br /><br />Hoag sort of jumped off her normal track with this one and there was much less romance and rather vivid descriptions of love scenes in this one and I found that to be rather refreshing.  There was little that was gratuitous in this one.  The action rolled along at a good clip and we were introduced to some memorable characters.  Yes, there was violence in this one and the tale had many twists and turns...no read herrings; just good plot swings which were logical and kept the story moving.  The story can and should be classified as a thriller but it is a thriller that is pretty well believable proving that factual descriptions can indeed be as exciting as so much of the made up stuff we are fed in current “suspense thrillers.”  I like this one.<br /><br />And the ending....oh my.<br /><br />All in all this was an excellent read.<br /><br />This was a library find.	2005-05-17

Nicklaus, like Palmer, Jones, Player, et al, are a passing breed.  Not only are they great atheletes, but they are gentlemen in every sense of the word.  Mr. Nicklaus' approach to the game and to life reflects this at every turn.  This is a work that can be enjoyed by both golfers and non-golfers equally.  I have probably ran into better writers that Ken Bowden, but hey, he did an adequate job and certainly got Jack's story across.  Enjoyed this one a lot and very much recommend it.	2005-04-30

It has a Strong story, strong characters and is simply well written.  Warning:  This is not the story found in the awful movies and TV series of recent years.  Yes, the films do have animals, but that is about as close as they get.  This is a good, clean read for any one of any age, told my a master story teller.  There were a group of writers that came out of the late 50s and early 60s who all turned out work of this calibre, and Norton was one of them.  Anyone interested in the evolution of SiFi (Fantasy?) writing needs to give this work a close look.  So much of what has been turned out over the past 20 years has been directly influenced by this and the other works of it's ilk.  Recommend this one highly and recommend you purchase it and add it to your collection.	2005-04-30

This forth book continues the story and actually does it quite well even though it is a \\"transition\\" book,i.e., a book that sort of gathers loose ends and sets up the rest of the story.  The first half is excellent but the second half rather drags a bit. But that is okay as it sets us up for the next.  As a side note, I recently was unlucky enough to have an extended illness with much time on my hands.  I read this series again, along with The Malloreon.  I actually took a pen and started cross-referencing the pages of the ten books involved.  I am now up to 233 errors/contradictions in these books. (yes, I know, I need a life).  I do not mean this in a particular critical way though...the errors and contradictions only add to the charm of these classics.  Recommend them highly to anyone wanting just a simple good read which is simply fun.	2005-04-28

This ends the Belgariad series and sets up for the Malloreon.  All in all these are good reads.  Most of the folks I know have read this series and The Malloreon several times...they are sort of habit forming.  If read for what they were written for, light books which should be enjoyed and ones to have fun with, then you will like them.  If on the other hand if you just graduated from Jr. High and are much, much too mature for them, then you should probably wait until you reach your dotage so that you can appreciate them again.  Yes, they are flawed and yes there are endless contradictions (some 233 by my last count), but that is part of the charm of this work.  Hey, go out to a oak tree in the woods or in your park, kick back, read and enjoy.  Recommend highly.	2005-04-28

Silly sex, silly violence and little story tends to make you want to yawn more than turn a page.  This is actually a good author so I was rather surprised at this offering.  Wonder where the publisher is in all this mix.  You would think, they, the publisher, would want to protect a well selling author and be honest enough with him when his work is not up to expected standards.  On the other hand, it did not really injury me to read this thing and I suppose if  you have a couple of evenings to kill, it is not all that bad.  I would certainly check this one out of the library rather than plunking down cold cash.	2005-04-27

For those interested in our literature and literary Paris during the 1920s and 1930s, then this is one of those \\"must reads\\" (I truely hate that term, but know of no better to describe the improtance of this work at this time).  The author's research is absolutely miticulous and fills in many gaps in the story of this remarkable woman.  Do be warned though.  Many of the names of people mentioned here are rather obscure (at this day and time) for those not immersed in the literary world.  This can make the work a bit difficult to follow at times.  That being said, this is a wonderful work to read to cause many of these names to become less obscure than they are now...one more of the many reasons to read this work!  The book covers some of the intimate details of Beach's relationship with friends and lovers that she so well side steps in her own account of this time.  Recommend this one highly.  Actually, you probably should purchase this one as it is one that is a good book for reference and one you will probably want to reread.	2005-04-12

Mr. Zelazny is a true story teller, a teller of stories with a wonderful imagination and a wonderful command of the language.

While being a dog lover, I am certainly not a city dweller, therefore I probably missed being amused by some aspects of this book.  I understand this is a first novel.  It is certainly better than I could produce, but, on the other hand, the author could probably work a bit harder of plot, timing, etc.  I would proably have given this three and a half stars if available.  I cannot say this is a great book, but it is a semi-fun read.  While I could not recommend actually purchasing the hard back edition, if you can get it at your local library, it is probably worthwhile.  To be fare though, if I were a woman and a city dweller, possibly I would have liked it more.	2005-04-05

Setting in my chair, I listen for two days as my wife chortled her way through this book.  After she finished I picked it up and was absolutely hooked the first page!  I suppose growing up in a Southern Town, years and years and years ago added to the enjoyment, but it would be difficult not to like Ms. Wall's story/prose/humor no matter where you are from.  The book is sort of a collection of short stories which have been woven together to make a wonderful novel.  It is a love story, or I should say, a series of love stories, but then again, so much more than just that.  I could not help growning (again) when I read Publisher's Weekly's comments as to \\"weak structure and plot.\\"  Do the reviewers for this publication actually read the book they are reviewing...you have to wonder...they soooo seldom hit the mark, and were quite wide of it on this one also.  Ms. Wall has a wonderful way with words, the phrases simply roll off the pages. I predict that we will be hearing much more from this author...at least I dearly hope so!

While the student of this war will certainly find nothing new here, it is never-the-less a worthwhile read, particularly for those not all that familiar with this particular era.  The book is around 400 plus pages long.  As I look at one of my book shelves in my home, I find over seven feet of shelving devoted to this particular war and I have not even touched the surface.  What I am trying to say, is that the author has given us some okay stuff in a very short book.  I would hope that anyone reading it though, would use it as a springboard for further study as the author has very much overly simplified things quite a lot.  Some of his \\"facts\\" could and certainly should be questioned, but hey, that is part of the fun of reading history and reading various authors.  This is a good read in that the author does have a good command of the language, tells a good story, and dose, somewhat, give is a picture of the horrors of this particular war.  It is certainly worth the time it takes to read it and I do recommend it.	2005-03-31

I recently read it again and it has lost none of it's impact over the years.  Moody provides us with much to think about and does a wonderful job of presenting his facts and findings.  Addressing a subject that cannot be proven one way or the other is a daunting task to say the least and Mr. Moody has done what is probably the best job thus far.  Unlike some reviewers, I appreciated his tenacity in defending his premises.  This is a well thought out work and has become a classic in this particular genre.  I highly recommend this work.

I am always a bit surprised that more have not read them.  The story line is almost flawless and the character development is acute.  Lanier's smooth prose just tops it off.  This is one of those works which I reread every year or so.  There is something about the story that sort of keep drawing you back.  I of course would like to see the series completed but am fearful that another author could not do it justice and would hate to see a wonderful work ruined.  Would recommend this book to anyone wanting a page turner with some classic writing thrown in for good measure.

As with the two previous books in the series, this is some of the best fiction written in recent years.  It is absolutely timeless.  At 60 plus years of age, I still (thank goodness) enjoy them.  Actually, I fell a bit sorry for those who are unable to do so.  They (as is obvious in their reviews) are missing a bit of the spark in their lives.

Actually, this is some of the best writing in this particular genre in quite a few years.  It goes quiet beyond juvinal fiction, although I suspect this series will turn out to be one of those that crosses age lines quite nicely.  Being as successful as they have been, they are quite open to cheap shot (goodness, there are a bunch of them here), but I would strongly suggest they be read before stones are cast.

I admit they are probably overly hyped, but in lieu of their popularity and in lieu of the author's skill as a story teller, perhaps this hype in justified in the case of these books.  As with the others, I actually feel rather sorry for those who do not get a kick out of these stories.  They seem to have lost some of the spark in their lives, as we can see from their reviews.

Caro is kinder to Johnson in this volume than he was in his first two, and probably rightfully so.  This work is quite detailed, quite informative and in my opinion, the best work covering the life of Johnson thus far completed.  The narative is very, very detailed.

If you are looking for a very, very mellow read, simply stuffed with wonderful observations, then this is one for you.

This particular book was first published in installments around 1930, as was the custom with pulp fiction at that time.  The series was more or less reintroduced during the early 1960s (that is when I started reading them) and has been around ever since.  For a work to last that long indeed says something.  I have to agree with the reviewer (Mr. Wallace) in that this is one of the better works of the series.  Each page if filled with wonderful improbable action and the villians are endless.  While John Carter is indeed a part of the story, the main character is one of his top warriors, Hadron of Hastor.  Plenty of Damsel in Distress stuff here, and all good clean fun.  If you have never read the series, suggest you do.  If you have \\"out grown\\" the series, suggest revert back to the little boy or girl lurking deep within you and let him or her out.

Publisher's Weekly, et al, above have given a good summation of the book (kind of sort of) above, so I won't go into that.  I will say that I enjoyed this one a lot.  The author's wonderful style/syntax are from another day.  They are quite reminiscent of the writings of David Grayson (Ray Stannard Baker).  Mr. Brewer gives us a wonderful collection of characters, drifting through the life of Henry Stewart, a very real person, so I understand.  I think it is important to note and remember the age of the man being written about here.  So much written today about men and women in advanced age is rather depressing, at the very least, but here we have wonderful book of hope and one of more realism as to the aging process. Being of \\"advanced age\\" myself, I rather like this.  Like a previous reviewer, I would have loved to have visited with Henry (more to listen than to talk) and am sure I would have been in line to sign his guest book.  I very much recommend this one for any person wanting a nice quiet read, full of thought and one that is very well written.  I do hope we get more from this author.  Thank you Mr. Brewer!	2005-03-14

While I will grant you that ERB has certainly used a formula (Dejah Thoris is captured again and John Carter must rescue), it is never-the-less an effective formula.  These books of course are sort of the grand-daddy of much of the Fantasy Fiction of today.  Please keep in mind when they were written and do enjoy the style and syntax.

If you like the John Carter series, then you are bound to like this one.  Burroughs is one of the God Fathers of current SiFi, i.e. Fantasy Adventure, and this work is a good illustration as to why.  While most of the author's work is pretty predictable, it never-the-less never stops moving and is a true joy to read.  While the style is a bit archaic, it is quite easy to follow after the first few pages, so give it a chance.  This is one of those stories you like to set on a rainy weekend and just get lost in for the simple fun of it.  Recommend it highly.	2005-03-09

I've been a Silverberg fan for years now and I feel you could probably make a good argument (I won't do that here) that this novel of time travel is one of his best works from a technical literary view.  It is simply well written and despite some few flaws here and there is simply a good read.  I first encounter this work shortly after it was first published in 1969 and have given it several reads in the 45 years since.<br /><br />It the future time travel is common.  It is so common in fact that it has become a form to tourism...you pick a date in history or event you want to see or witness and your tour group is given a guide and you are on your way.  This is the story of one of those tour guides who specialize in ancient Byzantium; more specifically, Constantinople.  Now I will be honest with you and inform you that I have spent several years living in and around this wonderful and ancient city so I suppose that is one of the attractions this work has for me.<br /><br />Anyway, Silverberg presents us with several paradoxes involved with time travel...all good food for thought, but few absolute answers.  For me this was of little moment as that is not the reason I read this book....I tend to slip over these time travel problems and simply go with the flow of the story.<br /><br />Now it becomes quite apparent right from the start that this work is most certainly a child of the sixties.  Readers who did not live through those times and remember them as at least semi-adults will find that attitudes have changed quite a lot over the past forty or so years, in particular attitudes toward sex, gender behavior and attitudes, and drugs.  Some my quite well find parts of this story a bit sexist and not all that politically correct by our standards of today.  It is not my place to pass judgment one way or another in these areas...things were the way they were and things are the way they are now...<br /><br />And speaking of time travel and sex...hmmmm, this book does explore those subjects and our young hero, who is most certainly interested in sex (Actually, just about everyone in this book has a very strong interest in the subject), finds that there are major problems; problems that can change history...like as if you run into your great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother and find she is one hot lady and is as lusty as you are...you can imagine the problems there.<br /><br />In this future imagined by Silverberg, there are rules of time travel that must be adhered to...not to do so can bring upon drastic consequences.  Our hero breaks most of these rules; both for good and bad.<br /><br />This is a pretty fast read and as far as time travel books go it stand right up there with most of the top ones...maybe not the best, but it most certainly in the top ten.<br /><br />I own the original copy of this book but fear it is falling apart....I suppose I will have to replace it if I live much longer.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksre those subjects and our young hero, who is most certainly interested in sex (Actually, just about everyone in this book has a very strong interest in the subject), finds that there are major problems; problems that can change history...like as if you run into your great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother and find she is one hot lady and is as lusty as you are...you can imagine the problems there.<br /><br />In this future imagined by Silverberg, there are rules of time travel that must be adhered to...not to do so can bring upon drastic consequences.

Read this one for the first time in 1979 and have read it at least twice since then. The writing is wonderful and the story great. I am not all that sure I would let just any small child read this one, as our society has changed so much over the past few years, I am afraid that many could not relate nor understand the circumstances of the people populating this story. It does touch on some subjects that many might find offensive, i.e. killing game and eating it, butchering livesock on the farm for food, etc. and, gasp, it does touch on sexuality somewhat. Admittedly, somewhat crudely, but it must be remembered when and where the story took place. On the other hand, it might be good for some of our young ones to get a glimps of just how things were. Time was when our meat was not packaged in plastic and the animal was not killed in a factory setting far from our sight. This book actually does a pretty good job of that. All in all, recommend this one highly.	2005-03-02

From my own point of view though, this is one of those you truely should read if you are at all interested in the subject.  If you take the advise of one student reviewer who suggested you read the first five chapters, then the last five and read the cheat sheets to fill in the middle....shame on you!  This is a wonderful work and should be read front to back. All in all I recommend this one highly.	2005-02-27

This is good.  With this collection of writings, and the many others of which he is responsible for, he has brought history to the general public, in a readable form, and not just let it molder in academic land.  This is a collection of Ambrose's writings.  It is not his more popular fist person interviews.

Elizabeth Moon is truely a story teller and this is a very, very good story! I did read with interest some of the \\"bad\\" reviews listed here and for the most part the reviewers were much more concerned with sounding \\"intellectual\\" themselves, rather than simply enjoying a good work. Suggest they take Eng. 101 over again, and or drop their X-Box playing for a few days.  This is rather sad. Ms. Moon's character development is wonderful - you truely feel you know the individual when she finishes. I am not certain that I could or would compare Moon's work with other authors. That is a trap far too many reviewers fall into. I do feel, that if you did not enjoy this work, you should probably read it again and try to figure out what you are missing. I do wish that Moon would contunue the story in one form or another. I was sorry to see the story end!	2005-02-22

Mr. Wright's odyssey with the Marines of First Recon during the recent Iraqi war is told, as far as I can tell, with rather even handedness and in a very non-judgemental way.  This was refreshing.  I was struck at the author's understanding and sensitivity in reference to the young men he traveled with.  This is a far cry from some of the rantings we received during the Viet Nam war.  Again, quite refreshing.  Of course, unless we were actually there, we have no way of knowing for sure just how objective this reporting was, but from what little I do know, I trust the writing and observations are pretty close to the truth.  Having been retired from the service for well over twenty years now, I was also struck with just how much has changed and more importantly, just how much has remained the same. I suspect this will go down as one of the better works from this particular conflict.  I do, like anther reviewer, recommend this as reading for either end of the political spectrum.  It is a good read and I do feel it gives us a better understanding of just what is going on.  Recommend it highly.	2005-02-20

I am not a great fan of The O's book club selections, but certainly had to agree with her on this one. Unlike the \\"Spotlight Reviewer\\" here, I do see why all the fuss was made over this work.

I have never been a big fan on Hemingway novels, preferring his short stories, but do make an exception with this one. I enjoy works which address this time period and place, and here we have a first hand account by one of the principle players.  To be fare though, you really need to read some of the memoirs of some of the others written of that period.  Hemingway did probably have some axes to grind, but hey, who dosen't?

Having been raised by a father from that era, it is quite apparent to me that my relationship with my father was my no means isolated, but somewhat the norm. This work struck pretty close to home.  Having spent over twenty years in the military myself, I can understand some of their thoughts, but even that cannot bridge the entire gap.  Those guys looked at life differently than my generation.  The author has approached the subject with great sensitivity and through his conversations with these men, I feel, has been able to understand not only them, but himself.  I highly recommend this one to any father and any son.  Well done Mr Greene.	2005-02-17

This is an excellent book for both those who have never expierenced the military or basic training and for those of us who have.

For those who have gone through the expierence, this is a wonderful nostalgic trip. The author has given us rare glimpses into the training process and the mind set of our young men and women serving us.

I have to admit though, in this case, it worked.  I am not a big fan of Hemingway's major novels, but do love his short stories.  Of the novels he did write, this one is probably at the top of my list.<br /><br />Hemingway obviously uses himself as a starting block to weave his story.  While the book did receive quite a lot of criticism when it was first published, I suspect much of that came from over paid literary critics and Jr. College \\"professors\\" who felt it was \\"cool\\" to take shots at the \\"Big Guy.\\"  Actually, parts of this novel contain some of Hemingways best work.

I suppose they can be compaired somewhat to the Burroughs' John Carter of Mars series, anyway they are sort of set up that way.  As one reviewer pointed out, these are not actually true SiFi stories, but rather fantasy adventure.  The writing style is more Victorian than anything, with many convoluted and run-on sentences.  Many, I note, do not care for this.  Myself, I find it sort of charming.  I do note that a couple of reviewers felt the grammar, sentence structure, etc. were, as they put it, \\"horrible.\\"  While I cannot disagree with this completely, I do have to admit that when I pick this sort of work up, I am not expecting to read a Shakespearean level of work.  Hey, I want to be entertained.  These books do that.  You should be warned though.  Mr. Norman's view of sex, i.e. the relationship between male and female, is laughable at best, sick at worst.  Sexual content throughout the whole series is quite explicit (as each book goes by, it gets more so) and deals with sadomasochism with the view that that is what all women really want.  This is not something I would give a  young reader.  This is a fun book to read.  The story line is as good as most of this ilk.  While I do not feel it is for everyone, it is amusing and I do recommend it.  I don't recommend taking to heart Mr. Norman's views on interpersonal relationships.  Read it and have fun!	2005-02-10

Manchester has presented MacArthur the General and MacArthur the man in an even handed way, i.e. warts and all.  Like most great men, Douglas MacArthur certainly had his dark side and the author has accomplished the telling of this in a good way.  On the other hand, he, MacArthur was indeed one of our greatest military leaders and certainly must receive acknowledgement for that.  Again, the author has done this well.  This is a good work for anyone interested in the life of Douglas MacArthur and anyone interested in the history of that time.  This is one of those books you will want to add to your collection as it deserves more than one read.  I did not that a couple of reviewers gave the book a few hits simply due to the subject matter.  Might I suggest that if you do not like the man, MacArthur, that much, they probably you might want to try a biography on some other individual...goodness know there are plenty of them out there.  All in all, recommend this one highly.  It is difficult to go wrong with Manchester.	2005-02-09

I do feel it is one of the better Darwin biographies.  It certainly is not in the same league with Janet Browne's two volume work, but if you cannot get Browne, then this one will certainly do.  This work is well researched and certainly presents us with a good look at not only Darwin the man, but of his science.  I had to agree with another reviewer who made the observation that reading Charles Darwin's work is much easier after reading this work on his life and times.  I also enjoyed the insightful look into the Victorian mind...it was an added bonus.  Unfortunately, I have noticed that the anti-evolution folks go through these reviews bashing anything said positive about any of the  Darwin Biographies.  The study of the man, Darwin, is not necessarily an endorsement of his theory.  On the other hand, Darwin and his contemporaries did change the way we look at our world and we do owe them a debt for that, and anyone that can produce such a profound work, indeed, needs to be studied.  Any one who denies this simply has their head in the sand.  Highly recommend this one.  Good biography and good history. Well written!	2005-02-08

The author did give a different slant to Hemingway the man, and indeed, the works of Hemingway.  I cannot say for a second that I agreed with the author much over 25 percent of the time, but hey, Mellow has his opinion, I have mine.  I did feel that Mellow beat the \\"gay\\" thing into the ground (as like in \\"Who Cares?\\") and did feel that the author did not have a good grasp of the works of his subject, i.e. Hemingway and his writing.  Again though, it was nice getting another opinion and did leave me with some food for thought.  This in no way compares with the work of Carlos Baker and his ilk, but, again, gives us just another view...always a nice thing.  I do hope though, that the reader of this work reads some other biographies on Hemingway and do hope they actually read some of Hemingways work.

I have to admit to enjoying this series so far.  As with the first two books, my comments pertain to just this single work and not to the entire series.  This third volume seemed to me to be a bit repetative at times, and for my personal taste, the story line did not hold my interest as much as the first two books.  That could very well just be me though.  This series is turning into one of those that I simple enjoy reading between other works, somewhat like the David Eddings \\"The Belgariad\\" and \\"The Malloreon\\" books.  They are fun to read, do not overly tax my mind as I slip into my dotage, and I know there will be many more to come.  As with the first two books, the story is complex, Jordan continues to display a very good imagination and they do provide entertainment.  All in all I recommend.	2005-02-03

I think I will give a short review on each book as I get to it and pass my own judgement on each individual book, rather than the whole series. Like another reviewer, I have certainly read my share of this genre over the past 45 years and I must admit this book, \\"The Dragon Reborn,\\" is one of the better ones I have read. It certainly is not my favorite, but I nevertheless enjoyed every page. The author introduces many characters and you do indeed have to pay attention to what you read, and as another reviewer pointed out, I agree that for those who want instant gratification, they should probably go elsewhere. The plot is very complicated, but very, very interesting. I do have to admire the author's story telling ability. The task of writing a major work such as this must have been daunting. Recommend this to anyone interested in the type of fiction. Read it and enjoy!	2005-02-03

This second book, in my opinion, is a actually better than the first. Character developement has reached a point where it is much easier to track the exploits and tribulations of each of the many, many characters Mr. Jordan has introduced. The story line continues to be solid. As with the first book, this continues to be a very complex work and you cannot just flit your way through it. I did read a couple of other reviewers who felt that Jordan's writing was somewhat juvenile. I might suggets those reviewers go back and take a second look. So much is in they eye of the beholder. I should be able to write like Jordan...sigh. Again, after well over fourty years of reading this particular genre, I feel this is some of the best. It may not be my favorite, but it is good. As to the rest of the series...well we shall see. I highly recommend this one.	2005-02-03

Jance book that I did not enjoy at one level or another.  Jance is a very gifted writer and an adept story teller.  She does have several ’series’ going on at this time, and while different; all are quite readable and worth my time as a read; a reader with a very, very large stack of to be read books.<br /><br />This is a somewhat slow moving story; a story without any real mystery involved since the author lets us know right from the beginning who done it. The story is though filled suspense and Sheriff Walker, a retired sheriff now working for a private organization bent on solving cold cases, works his way through a murder of a young reservation girl and discovers a string of killings with an extremely high body count.<br /><br />Now do take note.  The couple; the serial killers are truly evil people...I mean as in really, really sick evil people and some of the crime descriptions are quite graphic dealing with the butchery and the brutal molestation of young girls.  If this sort of thing upsets you, then it would be good to skip this one as the author pulls few punches.  On the other hand, these brutal killings are at the center of the story and I am not sure how else the author could have handled it and left the impact this book leaves.  I personally do not mind reading this sort of story now and then because I know this sort of thing happens in real life and feel it is bad to poke my head in the sand...on the other hand; I most certainly could not take a steady diet of this sort of thing.<br /><br />The story is well written and we have Jance’s method of wrapping South West Native American lore worked into the story throughout.  There are several excellent characters inhabiting this novel; characters that I as a reader would like to get to know better.<br /><br />This was a library find.s and made it a bit less of a smooth read.<br /><br />This was a library find.	2005-02-01

That and an endless reading list, I kept putting if off...you know the story, etc. etc.  I must say, it was money well spent and I do wish I had gotten around to reading it sooner.  I note that this work had the same impact on me that it had on several reviewers.  It is a difficult work to describe.  I have to admit that I found myself laughing out loud several times and I did enjoy every word of it.  I like others, suspect there may have been some sort of substance behind some of the words here, but hey, I am not here to judge that, only the work.

You may or may not agree with her, but her writing is quite witty. I do have to state that I disagree with a number of the reviewers who felt that writing and reading such a book is \\"Un-American\\" in some way.  Hey, this is what our country is about...the ability of everyone to say what they feel and then allow we, the readers, to read it and to make up our own minds.  That being said, when you read this work, you have to remember who is writing the book, who it is written for and that it is indeed a \\"Bush Basher.\\"  Ms. Dowd is a tallented writer. She does not have as sharp a tongue (or pen) as Ann Coulter, but nevertheless makes her points just as well.  I truely feel that we all need to read the works from both sides, left and right.  This will give us a greater understanding of where we are as a country. This is an entertaining work, one the reader must put into context for his/her self.  the style is quite readable and I do recommend it.	2005-01-14

The poetry here is the kind that you loved as a kid.  Then you grew up and became ultra-sophisticated and you were able to roll your wisdom filled eyes and look down your well educated nose at such work.  Fortunately, you soon grow out of this phase of your life (sooner if you are lucky, most get over themselves around the age of 25 or so) and you happen to pick this delightful work up again.  Yes, folks, it is still as good as when you were a kid!  Actually, I love reading it to my preteen and teen age grandsons.

McCullough, like his subject, Truman, has a knack for \\"telling it like it is.\\"  I have quite a number of Truman Biographies in my collection and have read several others.  This by far, in my opinion is the best.  The author has been very ballanced in his study of this leader, showing warts and all.  He does it nicely though.  Now I must admit to being a big fan of Truman so I am sure my assessment of this work is flavored by that liking.  Nevertheless, I do feel I know good writing when I see it, and McCullough's style is extremely readable.  I would very much recommend this work for anyone interested in the life of this great American President, and would recommend it for anyone wanting to begin a study of his life and, just as importantly, his times.  I really fell you cannot go wrong with this work.  Actually, this is one you will probably want to purchase, because, like me, you may want to give it more than just one reading.	2005-01-09

I like SiFi and it's related genre. i.e. fantasy, S&S, etc.  I really feel that this work, as a whole (all ten books) is some of the best out there.  Zelazny's droll humor shows through on evey page.  His story twists and turns in the most odd places, keeping you just a bit off center and turning the pages.  The author parades character after character before the reader, each unique, each offering so much to the story.  This is imagination at it's best.  This was one series I was sorry to see end.  Even the audio tape version, read by the author, is excellent and great to listen to while driving.  I cannot recommend this work highly enough.	2005-01-04

This is not one of Dickens' most noted works, but it is one that needs to be read to understand the authors evolution as a writer.  I had the pleasure (?) of first reading this one in a volume, years ago, which was printed in the late 1800s and which was printed for mass distribution.  Fine print, two columns per page, printing all the way to the page edge...you get the picture.  That was years ago...I am too old to even see the print now, much less read it, but it was worth it at the time and is certainly worth it now that I can afford a nicer copy.  The work can be criticized, with some justification, for being a bit wordy, but for my taste, that is one of the charms of the novel.  It certainly fits the times and the style of the times.  Recommend this one be added to your list when again you get into the Dickens thing.	2005-01-04

I gave this one five stars simply because it is Burroughs, even though it probably was not up to the standards of \\"Chessman\\" or some of the earlier works in this series. I had problems following the many, many characters when I was a young boy, and found I still had the same problem now that I am in my dotage. We do have a new character here, a fellow by the name of Baxter, so we get away from following John Carter somewhat. In a way this was good. All this series should be read and studied by SiFi and S&S Fans, as they are the basis for so much that is written today. All in all recommend this one and the entire series quite highly.	2004-12-31

Like the other volumes it is quite well done and despite what another reviewer's opinion is, quite comprehensive.  Granted, I you want to read more about battles, etc. they you should probably look elswhere.  I am of the school that a time period can only be understood by what they left behind, i.e. art, literature, politics, etc. rather than who they defeated in battle, or who defeated them.  This is only my opinion though, others look at it differently.  Also, I suppose if you are teaching a college course addressing this period of time, you would certainly want to gleen information from other sources.  That not being the case on my part, I thought this was a wonderful overview of a very important epoch.  I thought it was quite well presented.  Recommend highly.	2004-12-31

I would rank it a bit above pulp fiction as the author's style and character developement is quite good and the story line certainly works. Even those who do not particularly enjoy \\"ganster books,\\" (I fit that category), will find something to like about this book.  It is simply well done!  I would certainly approach the book as entertainment rather than a social comment on our society, as I am not sure of the accuracy of the research that went into it.

It does have some very nice pictures and does give some very nice tips if reference to photographing flowers, but skirts around the technical problems.  If you need a book addressing equipments, methodiology and technical facts, better looks elsewhere.  That being said, I did pick up several good techniques from it, i.e. tricks of the trade, so It was helpful in that aspect.  Luckly, the book, bought used, does not cost all that much so there is really no reason not to add it to your photography book collection.	2004-12-31

It is as good as the first (and not wanting to give anything away, chuckle), they only get better and better.  The author's prose is almost as wonderful as the actual historical work.  The author apparently spent fifty years in writing these books and it certainly was worth the effort.  He, and his wife, make history come alive.  Now granted, I am a history buff and simply cannot get enough of it.  I realize that not all share my love for the subject, but I truely feel that the entire work should be required reading in our schools. Not only are they superior to any and all text I am familiar with, they are truely a joy to read.  This particular volume gave me much more insight to the ancient Greeks, their culture, art and philosophy than any work I have read, thereby giving me a much better understanding to our own culture, etc.  It's just me, I know, but an added joy to this work was prowling used book stores and finding these things one by one to add to my collection.

Most of us in the West have little idea of the impact the East had upon or civilization.  This work changes that and through his wonderful prose, the author gives us a clear insight.  The work is meticulously researched and presented in a fashion that is quite understandable.  Please do not be put off by the sheer poundage of the book. At first glance, as one review pointed out, it can be quite daunting.  I was quite amazed how fast the work went once I started to actually read the thing, rather than stare at it on the shelf.  Will Durants multi-volume work should be required reading in all of our schools.  Perhaps if it were, we, as a society, would have a greater understanding where we have been, ergo, have a greater understanding of where we are going.  Overall, I highly recommend.	2004-12-24

You could almost describe it as the story of Huck Finn had be become a pickpocket.  Mr. Parker has an easy style and a wonderful command of our language. The book follows the career of a career criminal from the age of seven, starting during the San Franscisco Quake of 1906, through the depression and beyond.  The author's use of slang is almost lyrical, and after several pages, almost becomes addictive. The author is able to capture \\"hard times\\" with a sort of pragmatic humor which is sort of difficult to describe. His description of the country and it's people of that time is wonderful and quite accurate.  This is certainly one of those books that will completely hook you after the first page, so it is best to start it when you have the time to finish it.  It seems that everytime I get discouraged as to the state of writing in our times, I run across a work such as this and am able to take heart. I checked this one out from the library, but will have to now purchase it as I am sure it will be one of those I will want to reread over the years.  Highly recommend this one and I do hope it is not this writer's last!	2004-12-23

It is short and pretty much to the point.  The author clearly states that these are his selections and states \\"I let the reader, then, to make his own lists, helping himself to what he likes in mine.  Let him try to build for himself another perspective and unity that shall clarify human development for him.\\"  I note that much of the negative comments, here in these reviews, centered on the fact that the particular reviewer did not agree with all of Dr. Durant's choices.  These reviewers need to read the last paragraph in the book.  Anyway, I, like most, did not agree with all the choices, but I suspect that if you picked 1,000 individuals and invited them to create their own list of the categories Durant chose, we would have before us 1,000 different lists.  Durant's writing is as always, wonderful, has a almost musical quality and is quite spellbinding. This is the type of work which should lead the reader to continue exploring history, art, poetry and philosophy on his or her own.  It is a work that should stimulate further reading and study.  As one reviewer pointed out, they were disappointed that the author did not delve deeper into his subjects and subject matter.  Hey folks, this is a short work of short essays.  If you want more delving, then do like the rest of us....go to the library or book store and go for it! I highly recommend this one!	2004-12-23

This, for me was not one of those books I picked up expecting to be dazzled by the author's brilliant literary tallents.  If I want to be bored out of my mind I will pick up some of James Joyce's work.  I chose this one because I felt it would be a fun read, and it was. From a historical point, the author obviously did his home work.  This was impressive.  Yes, I agree with another reviewer's assessment that the author certainly has a problem with women and yet another, in that the few sex scenes were pretty poorly done and more than just a bit gratuitous, floating somewhere between silly and gross.  On the other hand, this was a first novel, and I am sure his publisher wanted to get as much bang for the buck as they could...ergo, \\"lets throw in some sex.\\"<br />The book did offer entertainment, held my interest, and I certainly did not regrete reading it.  It was a good first try.  I must admit to being a bit shocked at the apparent absolute venom injected into some of the reviews of this book.  Hey, even at worse it was not all that bad.  Perhaps it was because the author is a lawyer...hmmmm...just a thought.  Anyway, I do recommend it as a pleasant way to drift through a weekend.  Overall recommend.  Just a note:  Perhaps in future novels, the author could perhaps make at least one or two of his characters a bit more likeable.  In this work, you really did not care if any or all of them made it alive through to the end, with the possible exception of the old man's cat.	2004-12-19

I really did not read this book expecting a \\"mystery\\" or a \\"who done it,\\" something you could pretty well figure out by reading the inside flap of the cover.  It was pretty much a no brainer to catch this fact before the first page was read. Whether or not this is great literature, I suppose it is a matter of taste.  I quite often do not agree with others on what is great and what is not.  Rather, I approached this work from the point of view of reading something which was simply a pleasure to read, something that was \\"different\\" and this one certainly was.  I loved the author's usage of our language, his syntax, and yes, I must admit, by reading this book I did indeed increase my vocabulary.  (Of course, living here in the Ozark Mountains, and having a rather narrow view of the world at large, it was not difficult to do, i.e. increase my vocabulary).  I was very pleasantly surprised at the author's ability to so well describe \\"old age,\\" per se.  Being about there myself, i.e. into my dotage, the author pretty well hit the mark.  It was rather amazing to find a author so young that could describe the results of aging so well.  I am afraid I must disagree with another reviewer who happened to agree with Publisher's Weekly in that they had hit the mark.  After quite a few years of reading their reviews, Publisher's Weekly, I have found very, very few times that I have agreed with them, and certainly this was one of those times.  This work takes only a couple of settings to finish and it is well worth the time.  Recommend it highly.	2004-12-13

This is a well done piece of historical fiction by any standard.  The author has obviously done his research.  Because of the time, religion, sin, faith, morals and leadership all come into play.  I was struck by the timelessness of this work.  When you take a close look at the problems encountered by the primary characters in the book, we find this same theme repeated time and again throughout history, indeed our own history.  Many of the incidents taking place here, in 1630 could be ripped from the pages of \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\"  It does not take a great leap to turn on the evening news and catch glipses of the very problems the author addresses here. That being said, I do feel the author's wonderful use of the language, his character development and insight to human character make the book well worth the read.  Very much recommend this one.  It should make you think!	2004-12-09

If you start with only one book, start with this one.  The author methodically goes step by step, using fly patterns which require most, if not all, of the basic skills.  The photography and illustrations are wonderful.  Not only does the author give you exact, easy to follow directions each step of the way, he goes as far as to give a point by point review of what should be done if you find yourself in a mess. (invaluable for a klutz like myself).  This, as I indicated, is by far one of the best books for beginners, but should certainly be owned and used by more advanced fly tiers also.  The price is well worth it and in the long run will save you much money and certainly much time and frustration.  I do wish there were more \\"how to\\" books around of this quality.

As with my first reading, I enjoyed it just as much.  Now I do admit to being a big Amber fan, so maybe that is part of what did it for me. I also enjoy time travel stories.  The book is written in a light fashion, a fashion meant to be enjoyed and to entertain and does this well.  I suspect it may not be everyones cup of tea, but for Zelazny fans, it will be a treat.

I did find this book to be the funniest of Updikes work, but perhaps my sense of humor is slightly off center. The book is cerainly a satire and is rather cruel and a bit vendictive when it comes to the current human condition, feminism, new age stuff, et al. The format, a series of letters and communications is quite readable and you almost get the feeling of snooping on someone elses life. I do feel it is a good work and do feel those who enjoy Updikes work owe it to themselves the read.  Comment | Permalink	2004-12-04

It is a review of the book.  It is not a argument either pro or con as to the writer's political stance. In his latest work, Cuomo does indeed give us some points to ponder, i.e. where we have been, where we are at and most importantly, where we are going.  He does this rather well.  The work certainly has some strong points and good points.  On the other hand, Cuomo's almost manic Bush bashing wears a bit thin after the first three chapters or so. This is all well and good if you enjoy Bush Bashing.  Certainly we need comparisons, but my goodness, this certainly could have been handled a little more evenly.  Like so many before him, Cuomo has sort of twisted some of Lincoln's word to meet his (Cuomo's) needs. Unlike so many before him, he has done a pretty good job of it.  Yet again, on the other hand, Cuomo does indeed bring out some very good points and does document some very thoughtful observations.  This is one of those books that will thrill the liberals and put the conservatives in a snit.  I do encourge you to read the entire book though whether you agree with Cuomo's philosophy or not.  The book is rather well written and I do feel it is a good thing to examine both sides of any issue in depth.  This book just gives us another tool to do so.  Recommend you read this one no matter which side of the line you stand...there are things to be learned from it.	2004-12-02

It has been quite some time now that I have read a novel by John Saul.  My wife has read most of his books, including this one and to be honest I grabbed this one off of the shelf at the library on a whim.<br /><br />This one has a ‘creepy factor” of about a 6.5 on the creepy scale and deals with an old house, spirits inhabiting the old house, two dysfunctional families, two troubled and bullied teen agers, witchcraft and a story that moves along at a good pace.<br /><br />Most of the elements of the story listed above have been used time and time again by various authors but in my opinion are no worse for the wear.  Saul has handled the material quite well and has come up with several interesting and different twists.<br /><br />I must say that for the most part I enjoyed this one although I did feel that the ending was rather lame and anticlimactic...but hey, that could just be me.  I did like it enough, as did my wife, that after a period of time we did find the CD version of this book and listened to it as we worked on jigsaw puzzles and while traveling.  Despite knowing the ending and the story it was pleasing to listen to be cause we could talk while listening and not miss out on much.<br /><br />This was a library find.	2004-11-25

We need works such as this at a time when so many of our families and communities seem to be bent on distruction, and more importantly, we need to read these works and ponder them.

Of course I like time travel novels and stories and this had a bit of a different slant.  The author did a nice job of his character developement and the story did take some unexpected twists.  I must admit that I had a bit of a problem following the story from time to time as the story line is indeed, as others have pointed out, quite complex.  On the other hand, I am not the sharpest crayon in the box, so maybe it was just me.  Also, there were some very sexually graphic scenes in the book, which overall I don't mind, I enjoy a well done sex scene or two in most works.  I just failed to catch how on earth they had anything to do with the story in this books case.  I think the word I am looking for is \\"gratuitous.\\"  I do think those that got their noses out of joint due to the creationest bashing were missing the point somewhat, also the moaning over evolution has been a bit much in some of the reviews, but hey, it does not take much to offend these days it seems. All in all, while I have certainly read better, I did enjoy this one and would recommend it as a good read.  AND to the reviewer here that gave away the ending of the book...shame on you!	2004-11-23

Not only does the author give us a picture of a man, most know little of, his works maybe, but not the man, but also a wonderful look at a country most of us seldom consider.  Academic and popular history works tend to flit over this period of our nations history, in particular this aspect of it.  In this volume we have a history of a man, a history of art and history of a new country, one which we will never see again.  Per usual, Mr. Rhodes has given us a well researched, well written book, simply full of facts and points we should all ponder.  Birders of today, myself included, will be and was, rather shocked at Audubon's methodology, but we must remember the times Audubon lived and be a bit open minded about it.  I like to compare this work with \\"The Cotton Kingdom,\\" another work that gives us great insight to early America.  All this and a very nice little love story thrown in to boot.  What more could we ask for?  This new biography was certainly needed and I am please that a author of Mr. Rhodes' calibre decided to take the task on.  Recommend you actually purchase this one as it is a book you will probably want to give a second reading down the road...I know I will.  I highly recommend.	2004-11-21

Her prose is absolutely delightful as is her ability to tell a story. Here Ms. Jong has melded fiction, mysticism, historical fact and speculation into a wonderful tale about a fascinating woman in a fascinating time.  She, the author, also gives us a good account of the ancient Gods, and the role they were felt to play in human lives.  We have the added bonus of having some of Ms. Jong's translations (there are many many of these out there, and these of Ms. Jong's are as good as any) along with some very nice pieces (poetry) by the author, written in the style of the time.  As with any work, there are a couple of questionable lines in  the book. I more or less had to agree with another reviewer that the couple of lines discussing dildos may have been a bit over the top, but they certainly do not distract from the work or the story in the least....in my most<br />humble opinion.  I would also suggest you follow the authors suggestion that you find and read for yourself some of the great translations of Sappho's wonderful work. Read the story, enjoy it.  All in all, I highly recommend.	2004-11-20

A collection of short poems, written in the early 1900s (1917?), the people of a small town in mid-America speak to us from the grave.  It does not take much of an imagination to be able to see us, each of us, those we know and ourselves personnally, in the words spoken by these long dead people.  The poems are wonderfully related and well illustrate how one life can effect another life or many of the lives around him or her.  I will be the first to admit that I am not an \\"expert\\" in the realm of poetry, but on the other hand, I know what I like and I do like this work.  Granted, as one reviewer stated, this is not a happy work by any means and can be down right depressing at times.  This is okay though, not all of life is a daily string of happy events.  Not all lives are happy lives.  We all share certain sorrows, we all know grief and we all have regrets.  This works pretty well illustrates that we really have not come all that far, and our lives are not all that different from those of the past.  People really do not change all that much from generation to generation.  Masters' show true insight into the human condition of any age and in any era.  I began reading this work some 45 years ago and still enjoy it.  Recommend it highly.	2004-11-19

If I had a list of my top ten favorite reads, something I find impossible to create, as I like so many different books, I would probably put this one right at the top of that list.  I first read this one when it was first published around 1967 or 1968.  I, like another reviewer, have read this one each spring since that first read.  It has become sort of a reading tradition for me. It never seems to get old.<br /><br />The entire work covers the thirty one days of May.  It consists of some of the best nature writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  The author takes a very small geographical area, centered in the woods, around a pond and stream, and examines just what happens during this brief but explosive time of year.  Eckert goes from animal to animal, insect to insect, plant to plant, critter to critter and gives us a wonderful story of the life cycle of these creatures and plants during these thirty one days.  His writing is quite blunt and to the point.  This is not a Disney Bambi book!  Nature is revealed in all of its fascinating glory which includes birth, life and very sudden death.  The author does a wonderful job of showing us how the death of one creature, gives live to another and on how all life is so closely interwoven.  He examines the habits and habitat of each of his subjects and explains how one cannot survive without the other.  There are no anthropomorphisms here, and rabbit is a rabbit and a blot fly is a blot fly.  Yet, you find yourself pulling for the survival of this creature or that, even a wayward seed of wheat that is sprouting in the forest via bird droppings being deposited there.<br /><br />The book takes us on a day by day journey through surroundings that are all around us but few of us actually take the time to see.  It becomes very apparent and vary obvious that there are entire micro-worlds around us, so much is happening, so much living and so much dying...all for a purpose though.  The author's writing style is almost flawless.  This is one of those rare works that a rather young girl or boy can read and thoroughly enjoy and at the same time can be just as enjoyable to geezers like myself!<br /><br />Now I have always been fascinated by the outdoors and nature, even as a very, very small child.  This book though, started me on a life long hobby.  As an example; we have lived in our present location in the Missouri Ozarks for almost twenty five years.  We live in the woods.  My wife and I have left over two acres of our property as it was and is.  We do not mow, or disturb it in any way.  It is wooded, full of brush, has a small water source and can best be described as a rain forest.  I have spent all these years since we began living here, studying this small patch of \\"wilderness.\\"  This has not been a casual study, to be quite frank, I get pretty intense about it, observing, writing, drawing, painting, photographing and watching. The neat thing about this is that after all these years; I still keep finding and observing new species and events.  Love it!<br /><br />It you have the slightest interest in the world around us, the outdoors, and the life we share this planet with, then this is one of the most enjoyable books you will ever read.  Recommend it highly.<br /><br />Don Blankenships is one of those rare works that a rather young girl or boy can read and thoroughly enjoy and at the same time can be just as enjoyable to geezers like myself!

Johnson.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I feel that this volume, and this part of Johnson's life were quite important...it defines Johnson in his future years. We must take a close look at a man who is down and out, a non-winner, in order to understand the complete man.  My reservations with this work come in, in that I feel Caro possible had some sort of axe to grind here and perhaps went a bit over the top is his assessment of Johnson during those years.  I grant you, Johnson was probably not the nicest of men, not someone I probably would have liked in person, but Caro almost becomes manic with his digs.  On the other hand, the work, Caro's, is brilliant and continues to be the best of the LBJ Biographies.  His research is wonderful, and I found, once started, the books was difficult to lay down. I highly recommend this one.	2004-11-18

The story line is weak. The dialog is corny and the book is quite poorly researched. Even the \\"cussing\\" is forced and complete gratuitous - I doubt if the author ever listened to a GI talk. The book reads much like a Harlequin, a poorly written one at that. I would suggest the author stick to his empty Westerns. I cannot actually make enough negative comments to show my complete dislike and distain for this work. Jacket and in-book synopsis are quite misleading.

Johnson I have read, this, and the two following volumes, are probably the best.  Well researched and extremely detailed, they follow Johnson through his early years, as the title says, \\"The Path to Power.\\"  Not only do these books give us a good picture of one of the most fascinating men in our history, they also give us quite a history lesson in reference to this country and those troubling times.  I am one of those who is not a big LBJ fan, being a product of my time, but I must admit to having a fascination with him.  He was certainly one of the brightest politicians this country has ever produced and he was \\"in place\\" during the times of the greatest turmoil this country has ever seen.  To understand those times, those events, I really feel it is well to understand as much about this man, LBJ, as possible.  Caro can and is rather harsh when treating certain aspect of Johnson's life, but then, if Caro's research is correct, then harshness was quite called for.  Recommend you read this one and the two following volumes (hopefully we will get a fourth soon) and enjoy and learn.  This work is ome of my favorites and I must admit to have read it at least twice.	2004-11-18

While it is certainly not a collection of \\"way to go LBJ\\" chapters, it does go out of it's way to point out much of the good Johnson accomplished.  The book appeared to be well researched and read easily.  While I feel that it could have pointed out and examined Johnson's many, many flaws and their underlying source, there are indeed many other works which do so, so another good LBJ bash book was and is not probably needed at this time.

As with the first volume, the author is far more sympathetic with this complex man than most of his recent biographers. It is my personal feeling, that Caro's work is better, but it is a good thing to read these two volumes by Dallek to get a more ballanced view.  This was a difficult time in our history and Johnson and his contemporaries were difficult men (and women) to understand and judge. As with any story, we owe it to ourselves to examine all issues from as many angles as possible.  Mr. Dallek has given us just one more of those angles.  The book is well written and appears to have been well researched.  I am glad I added this one to my Johnson collection and do recommend it.	2004-11-17

I have read quite a number of books, both about and by Darwin, and this, without a doubt is the best of the biograhies as yet written to date.  If covers Darwin from the beginning, up through the voyage of the Beagle, and a bit beyond.  Extremely detailed and very well researched, the books reads as smoothly as any novel, yet it is truely a scholarly work.  It is one of the most detailed works of this sort I have read.  I read a review recently in a trade publication that stated you will go into absolute information overload with this one.  That is not far from the truth.  As to detailed research, the closest I can think of, off the top of my head, is Dallek's work on LBJ...even that does not come all that close.  Ms. Brown's style is wonderful, her thoughts well laid out.  The belief in evolution is neither here nor there when reading this work.  While it does indeed deal with his life work, i.e. \\"The Orgin of Species,\\" it gives us more insight to the man, rather than the theory. Whether or not you are an evolutionist or creationist is moot.  Darwin's impact on our society and the way we view the world was changed with this man and we should know him and the society that created him.  To understand our current history, an understanding of this man and his times is absolutely necessary. I collect books about Charles Darwin, and this one now sets at the head of my \\"Darwin Shelf.\\"  I highly recommend it and highly recommend you add it to your collection.	2004-11-16

The book is well researched, and while you may disagree with some of the author's \\"cause and effect scenarios,\\" they are logical and do give food for thought. Some of her assertions certainly make mroe sense than many I have read.  This work is not as detailed as I like (that is just me), but does cover quite a lot of gound in a very readable form.

The author continues his excellent character developement and throws in a rather dark, scary and damp story with it.  I continue to enjoy the excellent flashbacks.  I do agree with another reviewer, in that you should probably start the series from the beginning and not start with this particular book.

I purchased this work a number of years ago and it has been a valuable addition to my collection. I read it, or portions of it, even now, every so often.  The Stilwell and the American involvement in China must be addressed in order to understand the scope of the war in the Pacific and indeed, very necessary to our understanding into  our complex relationship with China, even to this day. There is no doubt that Tuchman was quite enamored with Stilwell, but this is good as I feel it gives the book a bit more passion than the average, dry biography.  Little is known of this American involvement and it has been more ignored by historians than other aspects of the war. Stilwell was and is a fastinating figure, often misunderstood, but one who had a profound influence on the events of those days that are still with us today.  Now I must admit to being a very big fan of Tuchman and am sure my some of my delight with this book comes from that.  That being said, this books is a good read, and should be added to your library.	2004-11-12

I like well researched books, and even though I may not be in agreement with some of her conclusions (which I am not), I admire her tenacity in making her point.  The book was a easy read, as most of her works are and quite informative.  Like me, you may not agree with all of her conclusions, but you will have to admit that she does give you food for thought and a door into which you can view a historical event through a bit of a different angle.  Even though this was not my favorite of Tuchmans many works, it is still a valued addition to my collection and I do recommend it.	2004-11-12

I would be inclined to ignore the few shots Publishers Weekly made, they are usually a bit over the top and I have noted before, that they quite often miss the mark.  This was a well constructed work.  Character development was excellent. I suppose I enjoyed it more, as Owen, the main character, was close to my age and I could relate quite well to his bewilderment and reactions to different situations.  This is a story set to the backdrop of America, during the times of our greatest change, to the early deveopement of computers and the cluelessness with which most men display when it comes to women. Sex is handled, per usual with Updike, quite well. All in all, it is well worth the read and I very much recommend it.	2004-11-11

The title of this book my be a bit misleading. While it does indeed cover almost every aspect of raising African Violets for show, it is much, much more. If you buy only one book addressing the raising of these wonderful plants, buy this one. The book is written in a straight forward manner, presenting many details, without being over whelming. Technical terms (jargon) are kept to a minimum. You do not need a degree in horticulture to understand the points the author is making. The book is quite suitable for both beginner and advanced grower alike. Illustrations are simple but very adequate and understandable as is the author's style. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the raising of African Violets! I wish there were more books on the market like this one.	2004-11-09

I will say though, that I did enjoy it.  It certainly gives food for thought and those dealing with and working with those suffering from bi-polar disorder, or living with them, should give it a try, even if for no other reason than to consider the subject from a different angle.  I note a number of reviewers have used terms such as \\"sloppy science,\\" and \\"dangerous assumptions.\\"  Lighten up folks.  This is not a college or medical school text.  To be honest, if you are bright enough to read the thing, you are bright enough to see it's weaknesses and take them into consideration. Anyway, the book is well done, gives you something to think about and is fun.  Enjoy.	2004-11-09

If you like Victorian writing...this one is for you.  Please, before you read the book, realize who wrote it and when he wrote it.  The book is very, very detailed. It is written in a style which most are not use to, therefore making it a difficult read for some.  Burton, a Master Swordsman, did a tremendous amount of reasearch on this book and it was not written for those looking for a light hearted literary romp.  If you are not particularly interested in sharp weapons, word roots or wonderful Victorian writing, then this one may not be for you. On the other hand, if you are a serious student of such, then this one is a must for your book collection.  I do wish that more of Burton's writings had been saved.  I highly recommend.	2004-11-09

I found it interesting that there was not one character in the book that I was unable to picture clearly in my mind as I read.  This is a notable feat for such a short work.  The author has taken a subject, a problem, which is all too common in our country today, and given it life and understanding, as far as we can understand such a thing as abuse.  I had to agree with another reviewer, that we do see a bit of \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" in this one, yet it is, at the same time, quite different.  I was pleased that so much was presented through the eyes of a child.  I also found the humor to be quite applicable when it was used.  I was pleased to find that a movie is apparently to be made of this one and I do hope the makers of that movie do not screw it up, which is so often the case.  All in all, I highly recommend this one.	2004-11-07

It of course is the origin of the Ma and Pa Kettle movies, yet much more.  I like to pull this one off the shelf every now and again just to be able to chuckle.  When you read it, you must remember when it was written and what the racial and political attitudes of the time were, although,  it is a good read on that level too, i.e. seeing were our culture has been and where it is today.  I did read one or two reviews which compaired this work to some of the authors other work...good grief folks, lighten up..read the thing for what it is..a funny story meant to amuse. When I was a kid, I did not read Micky Mouse and analyze each comic book for political correctness, nor social commentary (although, being a dog lover, I was not always happy how Pluto was presented and treated) nor did I compair the Micky of 1949 to the Micky of 1952.  Anyway, digging into a book like this for those reasons is fine I suppose, if you are into such, but for me, I just enjoyed the read and highly recommend it.	2004-11-04

My goodness, I wish read this one years ago.  It is a very well written and well researched story.  I was absolutely amazed at what could be learned from a body found after it had spent several centuries in a peat bog.  The author wove a fascinating tale of a people long departed, yet, culturally are still with us to this day.  Any of those interested in Celtic history or just the history of Western Man, needs to find and read this one.  It is certainly well worth adding to your collection.	2004-11-04

While the author does touch in several taboo areas, this is not a \\"trashy\\" collection by any means.  I felt her \\"Delta of Venus\\" was great, and to a certain extent, this collection is just as well done.  While some of the subject matter verges on the disgusting, it is never-the-less well written and certainly squirms into areas of the mind which, are for the most part, probably shut for most people.  The author's command of the language and her skill with words speak for themselves as you read each page, paragraph and sentence.  All in all, I think it is a shame more do not read this work simply due to the subject matter.  The writing is wonderful and they are missing a real treat.	2004-11-01

It is not a book that can be enjoyed or used in just one reading.  It is a book to dwell upon and enjoyed and learn from over a long period of time, with several (actually, many) readings required.

I truely feel that even those not particularly interested in this subject would be able to learn from it and find the work interesting.  I highly recommend.	2004-11-01

Oh my!  This book is so off the mark from the orginal series is almost made me ill.  I must admit I was unable to finish the thing.  I will grant you that some of Sadler's work, some of the later books, were not up to the standard of his first four, but they were never the less interesting and readable.  This one is not.  You would think that the publishers could come up with something better than this to continue the series with. If you are along time Casca fan, you will be quite disappointed with this one...I would recommend you not even read it and certainly don't buy it..borrow it if you must.

I do not really like \\"gangster books.\\" After deciding to read it anyway, I am quite pleased I did. The author has used a technique which makes the book quite readable and interesting. He has been able to give us many wonderful facts without becoming academic. By this I mean, he has given us a popular history work , which, while not a scholarly, is one that never-the-less gives us a good bit of our countries history in a less painful way than a history text would. He has used a vocabularly and technique very effectively which often times was found in the 1950s pulp fiction crime books, but has done it in a way that makes it enjoyable and not laughable. Not only do we get a wonderful story of a very, very bad person, but we get a very good glimpse into the mind set of our nation during a very, very bad period of our time. The book is certainly well researched and very detailed. Like me, even if you are not into \\"gangster books\\" you will find this one enjoyable and informative. If you are into \\"gangster books,\\" then you will most certainly like this one. Don't overlook this one. It is a good bit of writing and I very much recommend it.	2004-10-30

It is as good as the first installment of this series - &#34;Pawn of Prophecy.&#34;This is a very fast story line with a lot of humor and excellent character development.<br /><br />Garion and his companions continue their quest to recover the Orb.  Their journey takes them to the land of the Snake People and Garion becomes more aware of his true destiny.  Again, as with the first book, we have some very pleasing banter between the characters and new characters are introduced; some to be quickly forgotten, others to reappear throughout the entire two series.<br /><br /> This is a pleasant story, easy to follow and holds the reader's interest. You should be warned though, these books are difficult to follow if you do not read them in the proper sequence...one book pretty well picks up right where the last one left off. For a nice, mellow read, I highly recommend these books. If you like, or are partial to this particular genre, you will probably enjoy them.

It rather amazes me that the author was able to get so much in so few pages.  Sadler is able to capture the character of Casca very well in this one and developes other character or character types that will appear in later novels.  The story is fast moving, yet detailed.  The nice thing about the Casca books, is that after the first one is read, you really do not have to read them in order, each book is a good story within itself.  Again, as with most of his novels, Sadler has done a wonderful bit of reasearch.  This is certainly true of this one.  The few errors he did make were of little moment.  Very much recommend this one.	2004-10-28

While a full overview of the battle is certainly a worthwhile study and read, I find this \\"one on one\\" account quite informative.  The style is easy.

Rice's touching portrayal of the Castrati is done in an honest and understanding manner.  She has done a wonderul job with her research.  There is much to learn from this work.  There were events and actions in our history that my make us uncomfortable, but they were real, and we should know of them, if for no other reason, to prevent them from happening again.  As a side note, I absolutely broke down and laughed at some of the reviewers who were, if not homophobic, then close to it, rave on and on about Rice's vampire epics, then write lines of disgust in reference to the \\"unnatural sexual act\\" discussed in this book.  Like sucking blood out of a persons neck is \\"natural. Folks, give it a break.

Ms. Rice has given us a good bit of writing here.  I have to agree with several other reviewers in  that it really has nothing to do with the tale of Sleeping Beauty, other than the title.  Now as to the erotica.  I suppose that should be decided by the individual reader.  I like a good erotic book and good erotic writing.  I am a big Anais Nin fan.  This work though, the sleeping beauty work, is only erotic if you are very much into hard core S&M, which is not my particular cup of tea.  Ms. Rice is rather repetiive at times.  Some of this stuff is rather scary, as a matter of fact.  As an example, raping a unconscious fifteen year old girl, from my point of view, is sort of stomach turning and disgusting - way over the top.  That being said, I must admit that the authors discriptive powers are quite acute and if you are into such things as complete total humiliation, which some are I suppose, then this is good.  I read somewhere that the author set out to write a book of pure pornography.  I do feel she was sucessful with this one (and the two that followed).  All in all, I think the book is well done.  I am glad I read it.  I doubt if I would seek out it's ilk again though, but then that is just me.	2004-10-24

The author falls into the old \\"war ain't worth it\\" thing, as if duh, we don't know that already, but he is a good story teller and certainly gives us points to ponder here. Some of the author's symbolism is rather difficult to follow, but this is a rather minor problem.  All in all, as I said, this is an interesting read.

While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him, Herriot his due, the man could write well and could tell a great story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?).  This guy though, Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding the paper into his typewriter!  The entire book is such a obvious ploy to make some quick money on the shirttail of a \\"dead\\" but popular author it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, my thinking being with each turn of the page \\"well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter.\\"  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of the library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly  would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here.

I first read this one over 45 years ago, and still take if off the shelf every so often and give it a reread.  The author's prose is wonderful.  The story is well defined.  It is an excellent example of what good writing should be.  The feelings the author conveys are absolutely astounding, particuarly when you know that King never expierenced war, first hand, himself.  That being said, and I do not mean this in a demeaning way, I feel that many young men, and women, today, will have a bit of a problem relating to the story and the style.

They were the sort of stuff a small boy in the midwest dreamed of.  That being said, and having to admit that I am no longer that little boy (well, not much anyway), I had very mixed emotions about this book.  I was a bit disappointed in the scholarship shown at times.  Some of the writing was a bit flat, and viewing Andrews through the eyes of what I know now and did not know then, Andrews' image has been sort of tarnished for me.<br /><br />I think you have to read this book with a good grounding and knowledge of the attitudes of most Americans/WASPS at that time, just as you have to view the Civil War and Pre Civil War through the attitudes of that time.  No, it was not right, much of what we did was wrong and down right disgusting and it was not \\"correct\\" by todays standards, but it was what it was. History is history and I do not feel the author was condoning any of the questionable actions that Andrews made.  Read this book for the fun of it and then read some of Andrews' actually writings and compair. Read it as an adventure story.  Yes, their are better works out there on this subject, that is a fact, but this one is simply more \\"fun\\" than most of them.  Recommend.	2004-10-13

I admit that I reread if every few years.  Not only is it a wonderful travel book, which at first glance, it is just that, a travel book, but it is much more.  It is a search for a missing part of a man's life, one, I truely hope the author found.  It is very well written.  The author has a wonderful command of the language, and is a wonderful story teller.  This is truely one of the few classics which came out of that era.  I had to laugh, and sort of cry at the same time when I read a recent, previous review here were the young man claimed he was apprently forced (good for his teacher) to read this book for a English Gifted and Talented Class in High School.  He hated it.  I guess everone has their own cup of tea, but in my work I do run into a number of contemporary (gifted High School English children who pretty well know it all) folks in these classes...that is where the crying part comes in...I truely am worried about us.  Be that as it may, if you want to bite into a great read, a timeless read, and come away,I think, a better person, then I highly recommend this one..Warning though..you will actually be forced to think while reading this one.	2004-10-13

I get quite sick of \\"academics\\" who just hate for their territory to be tromped on, and their freshman following, who after reading one or two history texts, are experts.

I must confess to you that I read this work when it was first published and since that time I have given it at least three other readings.  This was of course the first novel published by Tad Williams and for those of you who remember \\"back then\\" it was and still is a rather stunning epic.  Many folks compare this work to Watership Down which I suppose is as close as any.  The funny thing about this work is that folks either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it.  A close friend of mind who recently passed away was a big fantasy fan and he and I traded books for almost 30 years; both of us having extensive libraries. In general our tastes in fantasy literature ran pretty close together.  Not so this book.  While I love the thing, he absolutely loathed it...go figure!<br /><br />Anyway, this is the story of a cat; a group of cats really, and Williams has created a world running parallel to ours only this world is inhabited by cats and other creatures.  It is a mythological tale and I will tell you right now that this is NOT a \\"cute kitten\\" story...no, no, no!  There are extremely dark moments in this story; emotional moments and some of the scenes are not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Now I suppose that cat lovers will be more fond of this work than those that are not but that being said, I have met and spoken with many, many non-cat people who love this work just as much as cat people.  The story is strong and the story is good and the story is well written.  Now each of us have our own taste is literature and this is a good thing.  I have no problems with the folks that do not like this work and understand completely.<br /><br />I will say that Williams does know his cats as he nails their personalities perfectly.

I doubt seriously if it will be my last.  I enjoyed this book, depressing as it was.  Ms. Brokner's syntax is wonderful.  Her insight into her characters is qutie remarkable.  I work with the aged, talk with them on a daily basis.  I find it remarkable that the author was able to approach her subject with such clarity and authority.  I found the authors ability to take the mundane and transform it into the profound, quite surprising and rewarding.  I would recommend this work to anyone interest in themselves or simply interested in verg good writing!  Be warned though, this is not a \\"happy book\\" per se.  In may ways, it is reality, and as we all know, reality is not always the nicest thing to ponder.	2004-10-10

Not only do we get a very well researched biography of a very interesting life, but we get a very good picture of the times he lived.  We are now being flooded with works addressing this era of American History, rightfully so, and this work gives us another \\"slant,\\" one we may find missing in other works.  I must admit to being one of those who knew only one side of the Guthrie story, the musical, and was certainly ignorant of what made, what caused that wonderful music to exist.  It is good to be able to put the music and the man into proper prespective.  I do think we have to take care and not be overly judgemental of the Gutheries of this world and their chosen life styles and politics.  Most sucessful men and women in our history have certainly had their dark side.  We have to be able to take the good with the bad and I feel this biography has done a woderful job in pointing this out.  I found the text to be easy on the eye, facts well presented and foot notes to be wonderful (almost as helpful and interesting as the bulk of the book itself).  I highy recommend this one.	2004-10-10

Very good story telling here.  This is a collection of stories, probably more about human emotions, than about war, although there is plenty of that too.  Mr. O'Brien is a skilled writer whose prose is quite pleasing to the eye and ear.  His insight to human emotion, particuarly emotions brought out by stress, is wonderful.  This is an easy read and the book should be added to your shelf.  Highly recommend.	2004-10-10

I would hate to classify it as a novel, per se, as it is more akin to a short story, or short narrative.  The author's use of language is wonderful, lyrical yet rather shocking.  The author touches on so many emotions and does it so well, that this one is bound to stay with you for some time. Very highly recommend this one, and I promise you will not be sorry after reading it. Hope we get more of the same from Mr. Lychack.	2004-10-09

The author tells a compelling tale of battle, the Marines and the war in the Pacific.  It is accounts like this one that enable us to increase our understanding of those times, those of us who were not actually there.  I highly recommend this one.	2004-10-08

I must admit to have read better biographies.  That being said, I must admit to have enjoyed this one, warts and all.  I got the feeling that Ms. Erickson had some sort of agenda throughout the book, but for the life of me, dull witted me, I missed it.  I am not at all sure that the sexual romps described here are all that important to Russian History, per se, but hey, they did make interesting reading...sort of.  I did give this one four stars as Ms. Erickson is certainly a gifted writer and was able to pull off at least 80 percent of the book.  I do not feel that after reading it, one should try passing themselves off as an expert on Russian history, or even poor Catherine, for that matter.	2004-10-08

It is a wonderful first hand account by an American traveler, traveling through the Southern United States just prior to the Civil War.  You have to remember the time in which it was written and take into concideration style, syntax, and most importantly, attitude.  For the serious student of the Civil War, it is a must read and a must for the collection.  Times were hard then, and this gives a great account of what one would have encountered at that time.  This is one you will probably want to read twice, as a matter of fact.  All in all, I highly recommend.	2004-10-08

I cannot I say I agree with the entire premise, but I did find it rather thought provoking and certainly worth considering.  As always, I do have a problem with the author's absolutelisms, but hey, it is their book and they certainly have a right to their opinion.  Of course books such as this will only be given their final worth with time.  Sort of gives you good incentive to live to be about 200 years old, huh?  Anyway, I have this one three stars simply as I did not feel it was their best work, and parts of it were sort of sloggy, but I do feel it is worth the time to read it and certainly ponder it.	2004-10-08

The author's style and syntax is wonderful and makes for an easy read.  The book is extremely informative.  I have delt in this area for years, i.e. orchids, and know for a fact, if anything, the author has down played the infighting, the horrible and insave government regulations, et al.

The story is pleasant, fast moving and just plan fun to read, worts and all.  The books must be read in order, i.e. The Belgraid, in order to follow the complete and almost never ending story.

The work graphically shows just what people will do when faced with circumstances completely out of their control.

Lets face it, this is one of America's greatest authors, but like a baseball star, you just know you cannot hit a home run each time up to bat.  That being said, I, myself, enjoyed this work.  There is some very good writing here and it does need to be noted.  I really do not recommend that all of Salinger's work be judged by this one particular book, but it is certainly worth the read when you put it into context with the rest of his work.	2004-10-03

I enjoyed the books but with some reservations.  Some improbably plot twists made it sort of hard to swallow at times and the heroine, Goldie, is sort of over the top victom wise.  The story twists from place to place, sequence to sequence, and if you do not pay attention, you can be lost rather quickly.  All that being said, I do feel it is a fun read, if not examined too closely.  I did enjoy the \\"food stuff\\" and the recipe attachment.  I will probably read more of this series..hate not giving any author a chance.  Anyway, this was a good way to kill a couple of evenings and is certainly better that most of what is on TV these days.  All in all recommend.	2004-10-03

The author is quite discriptive in his narration.  He is able, somewhat, to give the \\"feel\\" of the circumstances..if that is even vaguely possible through the written word.  The author has a tallent for enabling the reader to actually visualize the situation...sometimes rather difficult to accomplishe when addressing military movement on the battlefield.

They are as fun now as they were then.  Burroughs' style is absolutely great and needs to be savored.  The books are action packed and certainly reflet a time in our society long past.  I feel to understand current SiFi and S&S, you really need to start during this time period.  We certainly have come along way, in may ways, but it is very evident that this writer and his contemporaries certainly had a profound influence on what we are getting today.

They are well told tales, fast reads but unlike many \\"fast reads\\" they are well written, believable and eventually come to logical conclusion.  The Soul Catcher is no different and I found it a pleasing page turner of a read.<br /><br />In this novel we have Maggie and her partner up against a religious sect (actually it is a cult) lead by a evil, perverted and fanatical leader (Think Jim Jones) and his sheep-like followers. These people prey on younger folks although there is a presents of older individuals; Maggie's own mother (a member) is a shinning example of this.  Bad things are happening all around the doings of this cult, beginning with the suicide of cult followers after they have been surrounded by police in a remote mountain cabin.<br /><br />To complicate and add confusion there are a series of ritualistic murders of young women.  Maggie and her partner Tully begin to suspect that the serial murders are somehow linked to cult activities...but where is the proof?  What is the link?  Is there indeed a link?  Is the perverted reverend; the leader of the cult behind these horrific murders?<br /><br />Well - you got to read the book to find out...sorry.<br /><br />Alex Kava continues to develop the Maggie character along with filling in a number of facts from Maggie's past that were interesting.  We have several characters from past novels and new ones are introduced of which I feel we will probably be seeing more of in future works.<br /><br />The story is a good blend of mystery, edgy excitement and reflections of a young woman (Maggie) who has a lot of baggage from her past to carry and like all of us, is a flawed individual.  I like that in the main characters of books I read...if the character is too perfect it is sort of a put off for me.  In this work Maggie finds out things about her past that shed new light on her entire being that are quite likely to have a profound influence on her in future novels.<br /><br />All in all this was a satisfying read and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks.<br /><br />All in all this was a satisfying read and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks	2004-09-29

It was very uncomplicated, the syntax was interesting and the story line, while simple, was fun.

I picked if off my shelf again, a few days ago, and enjoyed it all over again.  Being a student of the life of Charles Darwin, I have read the majority of the major biographies over the past twenty years.  While this work is a fictionalized version of Darwin's life, and is certainly overly simplistic at times, there, nevertheless, is no doubt the author did his homework on this one.  For a good simple read, and an understanding of the man Darwin (not his work), I highly recommend this one.  Mr. Stone is certainly a master of his craft.	2004-09-20

The author uses very interesting technique, uses wonderful syntax and is certainly an extraordinary story teller.  I found it quite amazing that the author was able to pack so much into just a few pages (a bit over 200).  Her usage and conservation of words, while certainly not unique, is nevertheless refreshing.  She, the author, obviously spent much time putting this one together.  I highly recommend it.  It has been one of the brighter spots in my reading year so far.  There will no doubt be more from this author and I am looking forward to all of it.  Thank you Ms Gillison keep up the good work!	2004-09-20

Not only do we get a very interesting plot, but a lot of good trivia also.  Very good character developement along with a very smooth syntax makes the entire book a joy to read.  I am not a big mystry fan, but this certainly could turn me into one.  I was also quite impressed with the research which apprently went into this book.  Being a gatherer of facts, I found the information in the book to be quite factual and as I said, informative.  Thank you Ms Albert!	2004-09-19

Some books catch the public eye, become classics and are with us forever. Other books; some quite fine books actually, are published, make a brief appearance and then sort of disappear into a void where such books go. This is one of those books. When it was first published back in 1978 it showed strong signs of having some staying power with the public. If I am not mistaken, it was even a selection for one of the book clubs which were so popular until relatively recently. But I have to tell you that I have not seen or heard of this book for quite sometime now. This is sort of a pity because this one was a pretty good read...if of course you appreciate the genre.<br /><br />This work was the first book in Moore's Soldier's Trilogy; the other two being \\"Against the Assegais (Zulus),\\" and \\"Storm of Steel, (WWI).\\" To be quite frank, all three of these novels are a bit difficult to find now unless you like haunting old book stores.<br /><br />Anyway, the setting of this work, \\"Bayonets in the Sun\\" is in India with Her Majesty's 14th Light Dragoons during the Second Sikh War which took place from 1848 and 1849. It follows the adventures and career of a young officer, Eldred Mallindine. It also follows the movements and \\"exploits.\\" if exploits you want to call them, of the Grand Army of the Punjaub in Northern India.<br /><br />Now unlike some books in this genre from authors such as Duncan MacNeil and of course George MacDonald Fraser, you will find little to no humor in Moore's writing. This is a pretty serious subject and the author treats it as such. Moore graphically records the deprivations of the fanatically proud Sikhs, and at the same time graphically records the deprivations of the British Army as it rapes and slaughters its way across the land. Folks, times were hard during this era. Moore sticks very close to historical facts throughout his work and presents it in novel form and in a very readable way. This is a fictional work of course, but it is most certainly based on solid background facts.<br /><br />The author has done a very good job on the battle scenes in this work and has done an excellent job of describing the country side and people that populate the pages of this work.<br /><br />Now I am not a big fan of historical fiction and actually read very little of it. I am though, and have been for years a Kipling fan and having read his \\"Barracks Room Ballads\\" since I was a wee one, I have always been rather enamored and interested in the British Soldier during the time of the Raj. It is one of my little pleasures - grim though much of that era was. I must admit though that when reading books centered in this area and at this time I am torn between rooting for the British and rooting for the Sikh.<br /><br />Moore is a pretty decent writer and if a reader enjoys historical novels of this era, then this is a good one to dig off the back of the book shelf.<br /><br />Against the Assegais<br />The Soldiers. Storm of Steel<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks, but it is most certainly based on solid background facts.<br /><br />The author has done a very good job on the battle scenes in this work and has done an excellent job of describing the country side and people that populate the pages of this work.<br /><br />Now I am not a big fan of historical fiction and actually read very little of it.

I first read this one in 1978.  I thought at the time that this was a bit of literary experimentation, and still feel as such.  I enjoyed it, but then I am a fan of this particular author.  I am not sure if younger folks, i.e. those who did not live the 60s and 70s could get the proper feel of this work, but perhaps I a wrong here.  Anyway, if for no other reason, it should be read.  It is a good bit of literature and we could all probably learn something from it.	2004-09-17

I enjoyed it then and after digging through my storage rooms (I never throw anything, in particular books away), I found it and read it again.  Certainly different than the standars SiFi we get today.  Anyone interested in tracing the evolution of SiFi would certainly be interested in this one.  The book is well written, well crafted.  While, as one reviewer put it, it will never be a classic, it certainly is worth a second look.  Recommend it highly.	2004-09-17

The story is rather haunting and disturbing, but it is one of be best crafted stories I have read in years of reading.  I can promise you, you will be hooked after the first five pages, and if time allows, you won't put it down until  you finish.  I must warn you though, the basis of the story is rape and this could be quite unsettling for some..I know it did upset me.  Than being said, the author handles it well and twists a wonderful story from a horrible thing.  Recommend it highly.  Recommend it for the mature reader though.	2004-09-17

I love this author's syntax. You will find little of the blah, blah, blah which plague many historical fiction works.  I first read this one in 1979 an have been a fan ever since.  The book was well researched and the story flows well.  Recommend it highly.	2004-09-17

I am a big Tuchman fan but must admit that her ability to get \\"history acedemics\\" all in a snit, adds to my delight in her work.

The Old Man and The Boy was great, this one is too.  I would recommend this one for any age.  I am a big \\"rereader\\" and this one is certainly on my list of rereads.

It is a very good read and certainly gives us some food for thought.  We do need to remember when this one was written as to social attitudes, etc., but if we keep this in mind, it is good.  I suppose you could read the book for it's social commentary, relate it to unspellable philosophical stances, blah, blah, blah, as one reviewer did, or you can read it for a very nice story to read on a rainy weekend.

The story of course is taken from the epic Beowulf, and the author uses a nice slant in using a outsider to describe events, and this makes it just simply interesting.  Actually, I must admit to have read this one more than once and probably will again in the future.

Some do this and fall flat on their faces; others, if their fans give them a chance, can produce some remarkable work.  This is the case with James Patterson's `Miracle on the 17th Green.'<br /><br />Now I will confess right off the top that I am a pushover for any story dealing with golf and must tell you that this is one of the better novels I have read which makes golf the center of its subject.<br /><br />Travis McKinley has hit his middle age mark.  He has been working for over twenty years at a job he actually hates.  He is suddenly fired from this job and at that time his wife also informs him that she is considering a divorce.  Travis' life is not going all at well.  He has always loved the game of golf and is actually quite good at it.  On a solitary round during a cold winter day absolutely everything about his game comes together...after all these years he finally has \\"it.\\"  Travis decides to give it one last shot and applies for and pays for Q School and against all odds qualifies for his card.  He has one year to play the Senior Circuit as a professional golfer.  I strongly suspect that 90 percent of aging golfers have the dream that is playing out in this book - few if any of us will accomplish it but hey, dreaming is nice.<br /><br />Now you will appreciate this work if you love golf but it is not absolutely necessary.  This is really of a man finally finding himself and defining the importance of his relationship with is wife and family and indeed, searching inside himself to find just what sort of fellow he has become.<br /><br />Nice short chapters; the kind Patterson is noted for, make this an easy read.  The writing style is crisp and extremely enjoyable.  Folks, this is simply a fun and heartwarming read.  While I do enjoy reading Patterson's other work, the Alex Cross books in particular, I have to admit that the book being written here is probably much better in many ways.  This is a short work that can be read in a very few hours but once I started it I had great difficulty putting it down.<br /><br />This was a library find.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksmuch better in many ways.

Of course Historical fiction, is just that, fiction, or at least speculation on the author's part.  The books should be read with this in mind.  That being said, I found very few instances where the actual historical facts did not jive quite well with the story the author was telling.

I would just like to add, in reference to the supposed errors in the text.  These errors do not in anyway take away from the story.  As most people, normal people that is, avoid St. Louis like the plague and actually drive miles and miles just to go around it, I doubt that many will pick up on these.  It is a well know fact in the State of Missouri that the people who live in St. Louis feel it is more or less the center of the universe.  We let them continue with this self deception as it causes them to rather stay there and pester the rest of the surrounding area.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks	2004-09-06

Character developement is excellent and the story line is smooth.  Simple is not always the best, but in this case it works.  I found myself actually caring about the character's.  I seldom, very seldom, read mystries of any sort, but my wife pushed this one off one me, I read it to make her happy and I must say she did me a favor.  Actually, some of our other younger authors could take some lessons with this one.  Highly recommend this read.  I think I will go out and get the author's other books now.

I found the work to be rather poorly footnoted and some of the author's conclusions quite questionable.  I also found that the work was quite repetative and that much of what the author had to tell us could have been presented in about one fourth of the pages actually used.  After reading the book, I certainly would not try passing myself off as an expert on \\"secret societies\\" and their impact on our present time.

A book that started with so much promise, then crashes...am I missing something here?  The author must have lead a very sheltered life before she began her journey.  She knew little.

D'Este is one of my favorite popular history authors and he certainly came through with this one.  Of the many works on Patton I have read, this one seems to catch the soul of the man closer than anyother.  The book is a easy read, comfortable and extremely informative.

I enjoyed it much more after I decided not to project my own expierences and attitudes (I have spent most of my life living in the Ozarks), onto the authors work.  There were parts of the book which were truely good.  Other parts made me worry. Setting in a tree during a storm is not my cup of tea, but hey, if it rang Carey's bell....who am I to throw rocks.  All in all, I would recommend the read, it was interesting and it is always good to look inside another persons world. I do admire the author's sticktoitness.

That being said, I must say I enjoyed this one.  Col. Hackworth's career is fascinating. Being a career military person myself, I could certainly relate to much he said.  On the other hand, he was rather heavy handed with his ego thing.  I doubt if he and I could ever be \\"buds\\" but we would, admittedly, be in better shape had we had more officers like him over the past 40 years.  The writing is clear, enjoyable and informative.  We get a very good historical overview of semi-recent military history and some wonderful \\"war stories\\" thrown in.  All in all I have to recommend this one (I must admit to have read it twice).  A very interesting life.	2004-08-27

Biographies by old warriors and old jocks usually are just not that good.  This one is different.  I have followed Mr. Palmer's career from the start, and after reading this work, felt I knew him much better.  It was pure Palmer.  The book is well written, informative and actually rather inspiring. As I suspected, I could not find one line in the book to lead me to a different opinion, one I have held for years, that this is a true gentleman.  Wish there were more like him in the world of sports today.  On the other hand, as hinted at above, Mr. Palmer has been one of my \\"heros\\" since I was eight years old or so, so, in my eyes, he could do little wrong, including writing his autobiography.  Recommend the read for anyone.	2004-08-27

While I was not surprised by anything the author wrote, I did enjoy her approach.  I do hope someone comes up with something more ballanced one of these days, but we probably will not get something like that for another fifty or sixty years.  I really feel we are still too close to the entire situtation to make a good, objective overall evaluation of Ms. Clinton at this time.  I have no great dislike for Ms Clinton, nor do I have a great like. I trust very little, either pro or con I read about either of the Clintons, and not knowing them myself, really cannot judge.  This book certainly gave me food for thought.  I do feel this is a book that should be read, keeping in mind that most of us, including the author, probably have axes to grind.  There is not doubt the book is well written and quite readable.  Overall recommned.	2004-08-27

I found this to be a pleasant read, with wonderful character developement and Moon's strange ability to make even the mundane interesting.  I love her details.  I note that several reviewers were whinning about absolutely no sexual content.  I actually found this to be rather refreshing for a change.  Like Moon's Paks, the author spends time examining moral issues, ethics, etc.  Her characters are simply human, with all that entails.  This is nice.  I am not a big \\"fiction space fan,\\" prefering fantasy and history, but I did enjoy this one and am looking forward to the following books. Ms. Moon is one of our more gifted authors/story tellers.  I still wish Paks would ride back into her mind, but until then, this story line will certainly do.  Thank you Ms. Moon.	2004-08-13

First, they are simple and simply fun to read. Secondly, There are a number of major plot errors throughout the ten books involved here that it is an absolute delight. I recently went through a proglong illnes, and for lack of anything else to do, started reading both series again. (Actually, this was about my fifth reading of all ten books.) Upon finishing, I was able to find over 200 discrepancies in the story line. I have no doubt, with future readings, I could find more. BUT...as I said, they are a fun read. The character developement is great and the banter between the characters is wonderful.<br /><br />Garion and his companions, after finishin thier business in the land of the Snake People, continue their journey in thier quest to take back the Ord from the individual who stole it.

I am not a big Stephen King fan and have only read a few of his books but I must admit that I did and do love and appreciate the original of this work and even though I did not like the expanded version as much, still enjoyed it.  The Stand, along with The Long Walk and a couple of King’s other early work I appreciated but as I said, I am not King’s biggest fan.<br /><br />This, bottom line, is a post apoplectic story concerning the ultimate show-down between good and evil and is one of King’s reader’s favorite books.  I read through some of the many fine reviews here (some of them almost as long as the original book) and some of them so detailed I feel I would not have had to spend the time reading the book.  I will not put any readers of this brief review through that...if you want absolute plot summations, spoilers, et al, please refer to other reviews.<br /><br />I personally felt that one of the strongest elements of this book was the connection between the characters in the book and the reader King was able to develop.  As I read this thing, page after page, I felt I really knew the characters as more and more was reveled.  Also, as I read this work, I found myself asking myself how I would react to the various situations the players in the story reacted.<br /><br />Now I have to admit that I love a good apocalyptic story so I was prone to like this work before I even started it way back in the 1970s.  I was not disappointed. I recently gave it yet another read and again...I was not disappointed and after all these years I was amazed as to how much I missed when I first read the thing.<br /><br />Do be warned, parts of this work was not meant for the squeamish and faint of heart...hey, this is Stephen King we are talking about.  I also must add that I did watch the movie which I personally though was wretched and wish I had skipped it.<br /><br />The original and the updated version of this work are a part of my personal collection.r /><br />The original and the updated version of this work are a part of my personal collection.	2004-07-26

Prof. Weatherford..if you read this, a suggestion - I think a nice book addressing and telling the tale of your research and the  writing this book would be wonderul!

Either the plant simply was not in the book, or the picture quality was of poor detail.  Actually, I cannot completely fault the author for this, but rather the Missouri Conservation Commission, who has been doing things sort of half way for years now.  Pity.  In the introduction of the book, which should be read carefully before purchase, someone has stated, if reference to the large number of flowering plants in Missouri, that \\"Even this figure should not scare the amateur because many groups (genera, have so many species that only an expert could possibly take an interest in identifying them.....\\"<br />Now that is academic arrogance at it's best!

I appreciated the way the author not only covered Darwin, the scientist, but Darwin the person and how the author examined the role of Darwin's wife and their relationship. This is a very detailed book, not one that can be read in a couple of settings.  It gives us much to ponder.

Not only is it a good adventure book, it actually teaches.  Being a nonscientist and more or less semi-ignorant of such things and old bones, geology, and leaping lizard type creatures, I found it to be quite informative without overloading me with massive doses of Greek and Latin vocabulary (of which I forgot all I knew shortly after high school). It put human faces on the professional crew who took part in this scientific adventure.  After reading the bios on the participants, I certainly would like to read more of their travels and work.  Thank you Mr Nothdurft, Drs. Smiths, et al.	2002-10-23

The book is quite well written.  Admittedly, the author is examining problems through eyes (hers) that cannot possibly, fully understand the plight her subjects face day after day, she nevertheless hits pretty close to the mark, all things considered. I do feel it would be good if she did some follow up at a later date.  I would like to hear and read more.  Thank you Ms Ehrenreich for the research and writing.	2002-10-22

Well written and enjoyable.  Hey folks, this is a NOVEL!  It is NOT a<br />history book written by some moldy academic.  Read it and enjoy it!  Thank  you Mr Ford for going to the trouble of writing it for us.  I look forward to more!	2002-10-22

Be-that-as-it-may, I enjoyed this book.  It was well written and I thought pretty well ballanced.  Many of the &quot;facts&quot; presented, will have to be tested by time, but for now, I feel they are probably as close to the truth we will get.<br />Ms Clinton is certainly one of the more fascinating individuals of our times and I am quite sure history will continue to judge her as such.  She is an interesting subject. In many ways, she is us.  The author of this book is an interesting writer and between the author and the subject, we get a very interesting story.  Thank you Ms Gail for writing it.	2002-10-22

It was quite fun to read!  I very much enjoyed the author's style.  I suppose now, I will have to read her other books.  If I found one fault, and it may be just me, I felt the author was rather abrupt in her introduction of new characters - I had trouble tracking them. Other than that, all was well and I would highly recommend this book.  I do hope we get more from Ms Hamilton (after, of course, I read her first ones.  Thank you for writing this story.	2002-10-22

The author's &quot;hobby horse.&quot; i.e. mental illness in the Sherman Family, ergo, Sherman himself, is pretty thin.  This is certainly not a &quot;end all&quot; work on the life of this particular general, but it is well worth reading.  I was not overly thrilled with the author's transitional techniques at times, nor his speculations as to motivation as he, the author, did not give us enough actual proof.  Would recommend the book for your collection, but would not recommend you try passing yourself off as a &quot;Sherman Expert&quot; after you have read it.	2002-09-03

That said, I must say I was rather disapointed in this particular read.  Not much original thought or insight to be found here.  I was rather amused at the author's efforts to use every arcane and obscure golf term he could think of.  He was a bit like a &quot;name dropper&quot; but in this case, he used &quot;golf jargon&quot; rather than celebrities. I also found I extremely difficult to follow the sequence of events.  The chronology did not always work out.  (I do wonder why publishers do not use editors anymore????  If I had one I certainly would not be misspelling so many words).  Often times I found one event or one bit of information referred to differently, even in the same paragraph.  All in all, I have read better.	2002-08-22

While I cannot say this is one of his best, it nevertheless is most excellent!  HBO made a very nice mini-series of this book and it was one of the few mini-series or &quot;movies&quot; that HBO did not entirely screw up.  The book is well written, well presented and does credit to the men of which  the story is about.  I can highly recommend this book.  It is written with compassion and understanding.	2002-07-23

When all is said and done, it is a \\"sour grapes, done me wrong\\" sort of book.<br /><br />Goldberg had an opportunity to create something quite good here, but was so hung up on taking cheap shots at Dan Rather, he missed his chance. On the other hand, I am not a big fan of Dan Rather, feeling that he is a rather arrogant, despicable sort of fellow, so I rather enjoyed the cheap shots Goldberg took. Perhaps this sort of work will hopefully shorten Rather's career and we can get someone who has a better grasp of reality in the U.S. today to digest, report and comment on our nightly news. All in all, worth the reading as it is quite entertaining, reads fast, and is certainly more fulfilling than listening to, or watching the CBS, ABC and NBC Nightly News. Goldberg is a competent writer and this is a rather easy read.  If you are looking for something with depth though, you probably need to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks	2002-07-08
