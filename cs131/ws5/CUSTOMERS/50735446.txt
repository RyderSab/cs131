Some of the tales are mystical fairy tales, others are modern day horror vignettes. There are three crowning glories in this collection: \\"The Lake\\", \\"Jack in the Box\\", and \\"The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone.\\"<br />\\"The Lake\\" is a haunting tale of a little girl whose life was claimed by Lake Michigan. Through a touching first person point of view, the narrator offers a tear-jerking look into the little girl's life and his relationship with her.<br />\\"Jack in the Box\\" tells the story of a little boy who was raised in complete isolation in a house that was a world all its own.<br />\\"The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone\\" chronicles the life of a fictional author who died a graceful \\"death\\", but still continues to live his life.<br />Although each story in the October Country is worthy of praise, the reader MUST keep in mind that this is an IMMENSE collection. Reading it straight through, the weirdly characters and dreary plots can appear to be never-ending. The collection could have been cut in half, and I would still feel it worthy of praise.<br />To sum it up, the October Country is an essential collection and offers examples of superior short story writing. But much like the world it depicts, The October Country can continue for forever....and never allow you to leave.	2002-08-08

Set in the 1920's, the action primarily revolves around young Douglas Spaulding...a good friend, a loving brother, and a poet at heart.<br />Like most Bradbury works, Dandelion Wine is not exactly a complete novel. Rather, many short stories pop up within the action...from a suspected witch that lives down the street, a trip into the country, and the purchase of new sneakers, each is a story within itself. Each of these stories is recorded by Douglas Spaulding and his faithful little brother Tom. They long to hold onto these memories and make the most of them.<br />Dandelion Wine is more than guaranteed to excite the senses as well. Bradbury has such control over sensory imagery that the reader can easily smell the sweet scent of dandelions on every page, breathe the small town air with every word, and hear the faint jangling of a trolley in the distance. The book is also chock full of meaningful symbolism, witty metaphors, and unforgettable similes.<br />Although it is in Illinois, Green Town could be any  lonely town, and Douglas Spaulding could be any young child who longs to hold onto his memories and treasure them forever in a bottle of Dandelion Wine.	2002-07-20

The novelization of the film is, without a doubt, equally amazing.<br />The author's tone in Spider Man is anything but formal. The text brims with Britney Spears similes, witty thoughts, and plenty of cliches. This nonchalant approach makes for a very fast read. I was to chapter 5 in less than an hour.<br />For the most part, the novelization of Spider Man follows the movie almost exactly except for some slight differences. Unlike the movie, the book explains a lot of Peter Parker's childhood, and the death of his biological parents. Also, the action of the book occassionally takes a break to reveal an entry in Peter Parker's journal, in which he's writing to his deceased parents. I thought surely this concept would be horribly annoying, but author Peter David has used this idea to further expand the webbed one's deep emotions. A more-than-welcome addition to this amazing novelization.<br />All in all, the Spider Man book is NOT a great American novel, but a fun, quick read that is as captivating as its blockbuster parent.	2002-06-11

This nameless family has appeared in previous Bradbury works; readers will recognize such mysterious characters as the elusive Cecy and the inhuman Uncle Einar.<br />The book is written in a very unusal format: stories within a story.  A primary plot laces throughout the book, but takes occasional breaks as a short story surfaces within the story. Each and every story, including the primary plot, strikes very inexplicable emotions within. Don't be suprised if this desolate yet heartfelt book plucks strings within your heart and mind; strings that you didn't even know existed.<br />From the Dust Returned's only fault is in its unusual format. Without concentrating very closely on the story, it is very easy to confuse one of the sub-plots with one of the major story lines.  A great amount of concentration is required to experience the full effect of this extremely short book (a mere 200 pages).<br />All in all, From the Dust Returned is an eerie romp through every aspect of the human psyche.  Its questionable characters and nonconforming plot possess a quality that can only be described as Bradbury-esque.	2002-01-31

That there could be a gene in the human genome that actually CONTROLS human population was just an idea that completely intrigued me. Having read a previous Greg Bear work, I felt for sure that Darwin's Radio would be just as good.  I was horribly disappointed.<br />The characters in Darwin's Radio are about as lifeless and two-dimensional as the paper the story was printed on.  Their personal problems are run-of-the-mill, and their dialogue with each other was, at best, incoherent.<br />In order to fully understand Darwin's Radio, a PhD in Genetics is recommended, if not required.  The science in the book is so incredibly REAL, that I found myself totally lost, even though I have had some genetics experience in high school biology class.<br />Toward the end of the book, I realized that a lengthy glossary graced the back of Darwin's Radio.  It was very helpful in defining a few things, but who really wants to be continuously flipping between glossary and text while reading a story?<br />Although I found the anthropoligical aspects of the plot very interesting, the rest of the story was nothing but scientific rambling and horrible characterization.<br />Perhaps I'll return to Darwin's Radio when I get my masters in genetics. This is definitely a book for anyone looking for REAL science in a science fiction novel.	2001-12-30

It follows the story of Ned Henry, a young time traveler who is sent to Victorian-Era England for what he thinks is a peaceful time of rest and recreation. He is horribly mistaken when he belatedly discovers he is a pawn in a scheme that could easily alter the history of the entire world. Every decision Ned makes could easily change everything, and his next move is NEVER predictable.<br />Told from Ned's point of view, his musings are hilairious and definitely add texture to the story.  The characters he encounters have a life all their own as well, including a bulldog named Cyril with a DEFINITE personality. Many of the characters previously appeared in Willis' The Doomsday Book; if you've read that, getting interested in To Say Nothing of the Dog will not be a problem.<br />This story relies greatly on dialogue to advance the plot, and bookworms who do not like dialogue-laden stories will be quite unhappy.  It's not exactly for the fan of hard-core science fiction either, as the story does not rely heavily on anything truly scientific.  To Say Nothing of the Dog is more for the reader looking for a hilairious adventure, with just a hint of science fiction. Just be prepared for a VERY suprising ending.	2001-12-14

Contemporary scifi from tons of cultures are represented in this book.  Many of the stories are translated from other languages, and are rare (and wonderful) finds indeed. The commentary before each story is expertly written, with references to similar stories in the same book.  The World Treasury covers a wide spectrum: from the traditional appeal of John W. Campbell to the surrealist (and very creepy) mood of French writer Boris Vian.<br />The World Treasury of Science Fiction is a superior examination of scifi in other cultures; it really suprised me how vastly different eastern European and Asian sf is from our traditional American and British works.  This collection is for any devout science fiction fan, especailly if you want to learn the true diversity of modern science fiction.	2001-08-05

Naturally,  science fiction did not appeal to me at all.<br />Until I ran across The Girl with the Silver Eyes.  To my third grade mind, it was painfully long, kind of hard to follow, but extremely interesting. It is the sole thing that piqued my interest in all things scifi.<br />Now, as a high school senior and avid science fiction fan, I reread The Girl with the Silver Eyes. For a child's book, it is extremely intriguing. It's science fiction and a suspenseful mystery all in one.  It can most easily be compared to a junior version of The X-Files: weird, eerie, yet disturbingly accurate.  However, when I was younger, I found the plot boring in many spots, not enough action.  At the time, I merely blamed this on my youthful impatience. But even today, I still find the storyline a bit thick in parts, and nearly impossible to continue to the next page.  For me to say that reading this book was an intellectual chore is not an exaggeration.<br />Any child reading this book will quickly lose patience with it, it has so many slow sections. Its surreal plot and wonderful scifi appeal is for the extremely patient only.	2001-07-21

(or at least be thoroughly entertained)	One of my friends, a deep NON-believer in extraterrestrials, told me that she was moved by this harrowing work.  Out of mere curiousity I read it.  And...it changed me.  Most books on the subject of UFO's and extraterrestrials whiz right by me, and I've forget their message within days.  However, Communion has stuck with me, and Whitley Strieber's riveting account continuously resurfaces in my mind. But, sadly enough, this book is not for the faint-of-heart.  Its bizarre stories and explicit descriptions are downright frightening; I can honestly say that I have lost sleep over this book, lying awake, wondering if it's true.  I would not recommend this book before bed.  If Strieber's accounts of his alien abduction are true, then this book is more than a nonfiction work: it is undeniable proof that &quot;they&quot; do exist.  But even if Strieber is lying through his teeth, Communion makes for a highly entertaining read.	2001-06-12

More lighthearted than the rest, the story revolves around the youngest Solo child: Anakin.  The clever plot provides HIS personal views on the ongoing war with the Yuuzhan Vong...the ultimate enemy of the New Republic.  So many other stories in the New Jedi Order series have revolved around major, central characters, like Han.  I found it refreshing to find the plot revolving around one of the younger characters. Not only am I anxiously awaiting the sequel to this book (Edge of Victory 2: Rebirth)  but I'm hoping for detailed, intriguing stories like this in the future...only about Jacen and Jaina...the other young Jedi.	2001-06-12

This is a stark contrast.  Green Mars completely blew me away, even moreso than Red Mars. Corporate greed, radical groups, and conflicting morals are ravaging Mars as numerous terraforming projects continue to turn the Red Planet green; full of adaptable plant life, and breathable air.  Kim Stanley Robinson has taken a simple terraforming project, and written it from a million different points of view: scientific, pshychological, political, economical, the list goes on. Also packed into this story is a menagerie of deep, human emotions that keep the plot running smoothly.  This wide range of concepts will appeal to ANYONE, not just fans of science fiction.  I deeply feel that everyone should read Green Mars; it's not only a peek into our future, but it IS our future.	2001-04-06

This is the first of Bujold's books I've read, but I still found the story easy to follow, with no prior knowlege of the plot.  Expertly written, the impressive cast of characters' dialogue is witty, even hilairious at times.  However, the Vor Game has a few setbacks.  The politics of the story become confusing at times, and I found myself having to backtrack.  The book also switches moods, going from light-hearted to serious in a matter of paragraphs, making the overall flow of the book a little choppy.  But for any fan of non-serious science fiction, I highly recommend this action-packed adventure.	2001-03-04

Before embarking on this book, I had previously read Startide Rising, so I was fairly aquainted with the author's idea of &quot;Uplift.&quot; (changing semi-sentient species so they become fully sentient)  To me, there is really no SCIENCE in the Uplift War but a muddled mix of politics and unexplained scientific procedures.  I feel that that the concept of &quot;Uplift&quot; is too awesome a concept to be left alone, to be fully accepted by the characters. I would love to have seen the author delve deeper into the process of Uplift, and making its history detailed, instead of a sketchy myth.  The plot itself in the Uplift War is formidable and easy-to-follow, but the lack of actual science makes this book a little tiring for me.	2001-02-02

It presents a plot that we've all heard before: What if Nuclear Warfare actually occurred?  It seems like a boring idea, but Walter M. Miller, Jr. makes this book extremely intriguing.  The ignorance of the characters and their society, is so REAL, that I actually found myself believing this story.  The story specifically revolves around a single monastary that is attempting to preserve the boundless knowledge of society's predecessors, but the tribal groups strongly oppose this, being taught that intelligence leads to nothing but destruction.  Although I am not Catholic and know nothing of the Catholic faith, I did not have any trouble undertanding this book, which is good.  I recommend this riveting and eye-opening novel to anyone wanting to read GREAT science fiction.	2001-01-04

The way a single teacher can so greatly touch the lives of under-priveleged students is awe-inspiring.  Through Braithwaite's extraordinary writing, the reader learns of how a teacher transforms a bunch of unruly teenagers who have a bleak future, to a group of mature young adults.  The gentle ironies are eye-opening; I love the teacher's teaching methods.  The best part, the aspect of To Sir With Love that really touched me, is that it's based on a true story.  This is a must-read....for anyone.	2000-12-27

However, I could barely make it through his biography.  It's written in a very disjointed fashion, and everything mentioned is so out-of-order.  It's also VERY outdated; so it's not even really worth getting now.  The picture section, I will admit, is awesome; some of the best photos of David yet.  The X-Files episode guide is extremely outdated; it only goes to season 3.  5 years ago, this book would have been a joy for me to read.  But being madly in love with David Duchovny, I already know most of what was in there. If you want anything recent on David, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.  The mediocre writing quality and ancient episode guide really isn't worth it.	2000-12-27

I was just going to read the book, say &quot;Isn't that nice&quot; and move on with my life. No such thing happened. I was glued to this book from start to finish. The first person point of view makes this startling account of war very personal. Although there are many disjointed events in the plot that make it rocky, and sometimes hard to comprehend, the deep moral philosophies compensate.  The ideas presented seriously made me consider the present state of OUR government and what it might lead to in OUR future.  Being fairly conservative myself, I feel this book presented many good points in a strong, conservative manner.  This book is so much more than science fiction.  It's an interesting look into the morality of politics and our government. It's a must-read not only for sf fans, but for anyone, really.	2000-12-06

Set in a world described in excruciating detail, I was awed by how scientifically accurate this book was, making it very believable. I'm normally not a fan of political struggles, but Kim Stanley Robinson has made the political struggles of the Red Planet worth reading about, and very intriguing.

It's a tale of  courage, morals, and combatting inner demons. I would also not hesitate to  call it a fable. It clearly shows how a single person can disrupt a perfect  little domain. It tells the story of a family that has lived alone on an  Aleutian island for years, and are perfect, until a stranger comes to the  island.  The plot is well-paced, there aren't many characters, but they are  very well written. This book also presents the plot from every character's  point of view, making it great to read. Each character has distinct  problems, and I think their mishaps could easily be applied to everyday  life. The symbolism is also applicable, the stranger in the book could  easily symbolize modern life, and the family could represent all that is  traditional. How these two concepts clash is very real, and makes a  wonderful story as well.	2000-08-26

It takes a very  long time for the plot to thicken in this book; the characters are so  deeply developed that the author leaves little room for an actual plot. The  ending of the book is very unsatisfying, it left me asking &quot;Now  what?&quot;  I also found the dialog of the characters choppy, and  difficult to comprehend.  However, I do like how deeply the characters WERE  developed, despite the terrible plot. I also really enjoyed the concept of  there being a central character that is actually female. (Rarely does a  science fiction book dare do this.)  Tehanu is a book not about  setting  and external circumstances (like most sf) but of the deep, emotional  conflicts of human nature. It's really too bad that this awesome concept  was presented in such a boring, pointless way.	2000-08-19

The plot does start out rather rocky, and at times, it it difficult to  distinguish between a character's flashback and the present events. As the  book progresses, the children of the story reveal just how deeply their  mother's marriage to a film director is affecting them. Set in rural Italy,  it's a very exotic setting, which contributes to the intrigue of the story.  Humorous at times, very dramatic at others, the mood of this book is  excellent. There are many instances of symbolism throughout the book, each  presented clearly yet subtly. Toward the end of the book, I was beginning  to realize how a divorce can affect a family, and how it can hurt the  children more than the adults. Like the children of the Villa Fiortia, I  was horrified, startled, and angered at the adults' immature decisions, and  I was entertained by the children's insufferable &quot;battle plans.&quot;	2000-08-14

There, he discovers how much of his true self has  disappeared since he was a boy. As good as the message is in this book, the  plot is shaky and boring.

To me, Vietnam was &quot;just another war&quot;; another chapter in my history textbook. Until I came  across The Healer's War. The Healer's War is pure fiction, set in the  war-torn jungles of Vietnam. The plot revolves around a mysterious amulet  that the main character Kitty &quot;inherits&quot; from one of her  patients. (She's a nurse in Vietnam.) As time progresses, Kitty realizes  the true healing power of the amulet.  Although fiction, this book paints  a vivid picture of Vietnam during the war.  The conditions the soldiers had  to tolerate, and the daily battles is described in excruciating, almost  explicit detail. The Healer's War gave me a view on Vietnam that no  textbook or history class could offer. I will never look at the Vietnam War  the same way again, and I now hold a  respect for those that served in it.  This book is a must-read.	2000-07-28

The Tilsits have owned a major china company for years, and it has always been owned by a woman.  When the owner  Isobel abruptly dies, she leaves her company to the only surviving female  Tilsit, a young woman named Ginny. Through the late Isobel's diaries and  writings, Ginny soon learns of Isobel's obsession with the china company,  and how her power influenced everyone, even after her death. Ginny is soon  forced to leave a lifestyle and man she is falling in love with, for what  she believes is the &quot;right&quot; decision for herself.  The Tilsit  family in this book is very intriguing, and I had a hard time putting this  novel down. However, at some points, the book seemed to be about &quot;who  Ginny will be dating next&quot; than the Tilsit family itself. However  captivating the plot may be, the characters are dull and seem grossly out  of place in the book. I recommend this book for anyone craving an intense  plot, but is prepared for a disappointing ending.	2000-07-19

With all the trashy romance novels out there today, it would be hard for someone to call this book &quot;romantic&quot; in its simple, pure ways, but it is.  The setting of  the story is described so well that I could nearly feel the ocean air on my  face. There was also a vivid cast of characters that was very much alive.  The plot itself is far more complicated than other Anne books, but that  does not reduce the quality of the author's work, nor does the book lose  its poetical sense.  Anne's House of Dreams is like reading a very long  poem that is difficult to forget.	2000-07-13

I was pleasantly suprised. The wit and whimsy that was so common in Anne of Green Gables is even stronger in Anne of Avonlea.  Anne never ceases to amaze me  with her creative view on life. This is also a very positive story, and the  emotional ending nearly brought me to tears. Another must-read in the world  of Anne.	2000-07-05

The town of Blackstone's past begins to mercilessly haunt its present-day citizens as odd objects appear  in their homes.  Tale by tale, the tension begins to build and suspense is  delightfully unbearable at some points in the story.  Although the first  three chronicles have shaky plots and boring characters, the final ones are  a stark contrast.  If nothing else, the innocent romance that develops  between the characters Oliver and Rebeccas is very sweet, and adds to the  texture of the Chronicles. I highly recommend this book to anyone, and  anyone reading it should NOT be discouraged by the dullness of the first  stories.	2000-07-05

Anne's view on life and her talkitive nature make her a very delightful character to read about. The mishaps she has are amusing and believable. As the story progresses, Anne  grows older and begins to mature.  Her struggles become more important, and  the story goes from childish and playful to serious.  However, through it  all, Anne maintains her optimistic and creative ways.  This book is a  constant reminder to us all that growing up can drastically change a  person, and yet keep them exactly the same.	2000-07-02

Yes, I did find this tale terrifying, but the rush-rush pace of the plot left &quot;The  Stereoscope&quot; very unsatisfying. However, this story cannot be  forgotten in the twisted web of the Chronicles because it reveals major  aspects of the intriguing plot.	2000-07-01

I suppose this explosive ending to The Blackstone Chronicles is essentially why I like John Saul's writing so much.  The suspense in this story is built beautifully, and I was truly on the edge of my seat.  The  main character Oliver is now forced to face the reality of his dark past,  and in the process finds healing and hope. After reading every Blackstone  Chronicles, I was very satisfied with the ending.	2000-07-01
US	50735446	R2SKA0B7MHV9FR	0441569595	769194143	Neuromancer	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A true original	This book is like nothing I have read.  Neuromancer is set in a future full of mind-boggling technologies and odd surgical procedures.  The main character Case's health is failing, and he must embark on a series of  elusive missions in order to survive. This plot is extremely interesting,  as is the concept. With most novels about technology, the characters are  lifeless and two-dimensional, but not with Neuromancer. William Gibson has  created characters that stand out, and are hard to forget. As great as the  concepts in this book may be, I found a lot of the technology hard to  understand, and at some points in the novel, the words become nothing but  techno-babble. However, this book is a true original, and its fast pace is  absolutely addictive. A must-read.	2000-06-27

Ben Mezrich writes very fluidly yet concise, making the pace of this book quick and detailed all at once.  I could easily see this as a traditional episode of the X-Files in its dark  and spooky nature.  However, the characters are very lifeless in this book,  which make Mulder and Scully seem like different people than on the show,  which is a little disappointing. But Skin is a must-read if you're looking  for a creepy story that makes your &quot;skin&quot; tingle.	2000-06-27

The main character is Rebecca, a quiet, friendly young woman who lives her strict aunt. When  Rebecca's rebellious cousin comes home, chaos mounts. This extremely  dysfunctional family makes the story very interesting, and difficult to put  down.	2000-06-24

This is the point in the Chronicles when the town of Blackstone is no longer a normal New England town. The citizens are beginning to worry, and I can clearly see the plot thickening and the climax beginning in this  book. This is a good thing after reading the three extremely repititive  tales that came before this one. This installment easily proves that the  next chronicle will be more suspenseful than the last.	2000-06-24

The plot was entirely too predictable, and the characters (save for a few) were shallow and boring.  I honestly did not find this  tale terrifying in any way. However, this story does set the stage for the  next installments, and definitely made me want to read the next one.  As  dull as it may be, it is essential for the entire scope of the Chronicles.	2000-06-18

I was pleasantly suprised.  Unlike the first tale, this one built the intriguing plot beautifully, and  I was very often in suspense. The idea of jealously driving a person to  murder is terrifyingly worth reading about.  However, this story is almost  identical in nature to the first one, and I found some of the characters  being a little too ignorant of their surroundings, and that made the story  a bit unrealistic. But all in all, &quot;The Locket&quot; is a very  refreshing tale.	2000-06-18

The technology is very believable, as is the idea of &quot;uplift&quot; (making certain animals as smart as humans.)  This book  also has a very original layout that frequently shifts from one character's  point of view to the other. I really like new ideas in books, but this idea  was a little confusing, and made a lot of events seem trivial. But as I  said, this book is smart, and yet entertaining to read.  I wouldn't call it  a classic, but it IS worth reading.	2000-05-24

I started reading &quot;Stranger&quot; expecting to be thrilled by another classic work.  And I was, at first.  Valentine Michael Smith was  one of the most intriguing literary characters I could think of, and I was  anxiously awaiting the outcome of this book. My opinion changed, however,  when the character Jubal Harshaw and his lovely band of beautiful girls  came into the scene.  At first, I was able to overlook the numerous sexist  comments in this novel, and &quot;grok&quot; only on Smith, the Martian,  and his simple and interesting ways.  As time progressed, the novel seemed  only to focus on the doings of Harshaw, and soon became a book about this  sexist pig who had more money than he could count.  Before long, Smith was  nothing but a secondary character, and Harshaw's comments were personally  offending me that I closed the book.  It's really too bad that an awesome  character such as Smith had to be crammed into the same novel as Harshaw.  Why didn't Heinlein call it, &quot;Strange Man in a not-so-strange  land?&quot; (in reference to Harshaw)	2000-05-11

As I read this, I could so easily picture this book as if it were another Episode in the Star Wars movies,  and could almost hear the unforgettable music from Star Wars.  Unlike other  Star Wars books, the plot is nice and simple; good vs. evil, exactly like  the movies.  What drew me to the Star Wars movies was the mythological  aspect, and The Last Command conveys this almost better than the movies.	2000-04-30

Normally, I read one chapter of a novel then become disinterested, but not with Enchantment. Orson Scott Card writes so fluidy, and the plot so flawless that this novel is truly  &quot;enchanting.&quot;  After reading it, I felt as if I had learned a  great deal about Russian heritage, as well as being entertained by the  story of witches, magic charms, forgotten kingdoms, and most importantly,  what true love really is.	2000-04-25

It's really too bad that better characters and plot couldn't be added to make this book good.  The characters are difficult to distinguish despite  their species, and I was rather shocked that there were no strong female  characters in this; all women in this book are shallow and lifeless.  The  plot greatly resembles a comic book series; random event after random  event, that never really tie together. All in all, this book is a waste of  time, despite the concept of the ringworld.	2000-03-02

But Fahrenheit 451 was so REAL, it left me in tears.  On the  surface, it's entertaining, and a person with little patience will  definitely find it boring but this story carries an important concept: Is  censorship REALLY ok?  I know very well that this book was written nearly  50 years ago, and describes a dark vision of the future. But this so-called  &quot;vision&quot; is terrifyingly similiar to our own society and its  present situation.  Are we truly headed for the same fate described in the  end of this literary masterpiece?	2000-02-19

The cultures and concepts in this book are so palpable, that it is mindblowing.

Aside from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace's dazzling special effects, the novel is better than the film.  More of Anakin's life as a slave is covered, which gives the whole plot more depth.  Terry Brooks is an  excellent writer, whether he's writing the details of a battle, or what's  going through the head of a Gungan.  If you're a die-hard Star Wars fan  like myself, I strongly reccomend this book.  May the Force be With You!	2000-01-22

After  reading it, I read it to my little brother out loud, and he was on the edge  of his seat, and wanted me to &quot;keep reading!
