US	49517851	R1FFUQINSD48A8	0061098027	771444694	Free Fall	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Fast paced intrigue	Free Fall is a thriller about a Hoover-era FBI file containing secret information on powerful men in government being found and stolen by a young clerk. A ruthless presidential candidate goes after the file to use as blackmail against his opponents. Before the young clerk dies he unwittingly involves an old girlfriend who is now running and fighting for her life. A soon to be disgraced FBI agent is hired in secret by someone to find her before the others do. Free Fall is definitely a page turner. The story starts fast and never slows down. There are no wasted words here like so many books and a few twists that will keep you guessing. If you read a lot of thrillers you will find a few of the bad guy characters derivative of ones from other authors but it's not enough to dull the enjoyment of the read.	2005-08-22

A garrison of German soldiers during WWII are sent to occupy a small, oddly constructed keep in Romania. The first night there, two of the soldiers, in an attempt to steal a gold cross, disturb the keep's only occupant. In the following days, they don't make it through the night without a soldier being killed. An SS regiment is sent to stop whatever is going on, but men continue to die. There is also great tension between the SS commander and the German army commander who isn't a Nazi and has become disillusioned by the war. They eventually bring in an old professor and his daughter, the professor being an expert on Romanian history and who knows more about the keep than anyone else, even though he has barely punched through the cloud of mystery surrounding it. <br /> <br />Up to this point I loved the book. A great premise, smooth writing and good characterization of the two battling German commanders. However, when the professor finds out who was released that fateful first night in the keep, I found it to be a letdown. I thought it was too early to fully reveal the menace and in the end, wasn't very scary. In fact, the more the backstory is explained, the dopier it gets. <br /> <br />The Keep is a quick read and a worthwhile horror novel, but I'm not sure why its considered a classic by many people.	2005-08-16

Out of the first 7 stories, I really only enjoyed \\"Loophole\\" and \\"We're Coming Through the Windows\\". \\"The Isolinguals\\" was a clever idea but not executed all that well. Starting with \\"The Hero\\" the book picked up. \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"The Emerson Effect\\" are both excellent stories. The last 6 stories are good but not great.

Each story deals with encrypted messages. In WWII it's the men trying to break the German and Japanese coded messages and in the modern era it's the hackers trying to encrypt their emails and such so no one knows their business. The book jumps back and forth between the three with no warning and eventually the two WWII storylines cross over and intermix. Many of the characters in the modern story are relatives of the WWII people so in some ways their story intermixes as well. With all this, the plot is actually pretty thin, but Stephenson somehow keeps you interested in seeing what happens next. There is so much here that didn't need to be. At 1150 pages it was in desperate need of an editor and the ending is a big letdown. However, it kept my interest and there were times when I had trouble putting it down.	2005-08-06

They spend the next 14 years mentally tortured by the experience. 1994 and they are brought together again at the Abbey to finish the recording. They are all frightened but know they must finish it to dispel their personal demons. There's a lot more to the story and a lot more characters which is part of the problem. I found the idea to be very original and interesting, especially the history of the Abbey. The book is generally well written and the characters well drawn. You are however kept from completely losing yourself in the book or feeling any real dread or fear because it goes on too long with too many people criss crossing too many paths. At some point, as  interested in the story as I was, I just wanted it to end. An inventive novel that could have better.	2005-07-23

This is the first Sedaris book I have read so I can't compare it to his other work. This is a series of autobiographical essays that are well written and driven by a sharp, multi-hued wit. It starts off with a great story of how Sedaris quietly fought a speech therapist who was trying to teach him not to lisp by avoiding all words with an 's' in them. One of my favorite lines in the book is when instead of saying 'rivers' he says 'many a river'. The strongest group of essays for me were when he went to live in Paris and took classes to learn how to speek French and quickly learned words and phrases that would never do him any good like 'facial swelling' and 'ashtray'. These essays provided most of the laugh out loud moments. <br /> <br />Not every essay is funny. A few were tedious and others just sat there begging to be skipped over. Sedaris is a very funny writer. I wouldn't call this book hilarious as others have, but humor may be the most subjective of the art forms.	2005-07-17

The only way he sees to get what he desires is to make a deal with the devil. He signs his soul away for 24 years of service of one of Lucifer's servants, Mephistopholes. He thinks of repenting and there are friends and angels who try to persuade him, but he continues on his course for the full 24 years. <br /> <br />This is a well written play and it is a bit creepy to put yourself in the position of Faustus and imagine selling your soul to the devil. My dissatisfaction comes from  what I see as a weak motivation from Faustus and a thinness at the plotpoint  of Faustus wrestling with what he's done. There wasn't as much of an internal struggle shown as I expected. For a play that has held up for 400 years I was expecting a little more depth.	2005-07-10
US	49517851	R3QDLQ7NOV6F22	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Interesting to a point	This novel begins with the main character's mother dying. He describes with dispassion the funeral and his lack of feeling about the whole thing. This lack of emotion is the main characteristic of this man as we follow him through his ordinary, uninteresting life. He has a girlfriend who he admits that not only doesn't he love her, but thinks the question is meaningless. He agrees to mary her if that's what she wants. He befriends a man in his apartment building who leads a seedy life as a pimp and admits he has no reason to be his friend but also no reason not to. Eventually this leads to a confrontation with some Arab men who are after his friend and he shoots one of them. The second half of the book describes his time in jail and with his lawyer and his trial. <br /> <br />This book is basically Camus's philosophy of life in novel form. He does not believe that God exists, so therefore our lives are based purely on our actions. We have complete control over whether we do something or don't and either way there is no meaning to it. If you subscribe to this thinking, you would probably enjoy the book. For me, I couldn't get much joy from it because I disagree with the main character's thinking. There is so much mundanity in the book. I'm sure it was written this way to show you the meaninglessness of this man's life, but it doesn't make for interesting reading. I'm glad I read it, but I don't think much of it.	2005-07-04

Their goal is to put a pharoah back into power in Egypt and extend that power all over the world by pitting all the main religions violently against each other. Archaeologist Derek Loring becomes embroiled with the group along with Scotland Yard and MI6. This is a fast paced novel that keeps you reading. The action never slows up and the author does a good job of making you care about the characters. Being a first novel, the author has some things to work on, like scene transitions and dialog. Some of the dialog is very unbelievable. Even though the writing is not as eloquent as it could be, this is an impressive first novel because of the depth of the story and the fast pace.	2005-07-02

The original author of this saga is unknown. It tells the story of King Hrolf Kraki's family and how he became king. There are also tales about his champions, their families and how they came to be in the service of Hrolf. This is one of the shorter sagas, only 77 pages, and reads easily. The story is filled with battles, sorcery, greed and deception. There is also an excellent introduction and notes section at the end of the book.	2005-06-28

The child is to be born without a soul and its purpose is to kill Max completing the ghosts vengeance. However, the child is given a soul by the psychotic twin companions of Max and is now a creature capable of love and feelings, but is still not normal and growing at an expedited rate. The people who used to employ Max are now after him to kill him. This all sounds good and should have been enjoyable, but wasn't. <br /> <br />The book is well written from a technical standpoint, but plotwise, very little actually happens and what does is confusing and written too obliquely to completely engage you. There are times when the scene changes so rapidly your not sure where the characters are anymore. There are times when you don't know who is saying particular lines of dialog. For killers, the characters of Max and the twins are not very interesting, basically cardboard people going through the motions. I had to force myself to finish this book as it was a dull ride on the road to hell.	2005-06-25

If you have any interest in ancient Irish folklore and culture, these stories  give you interesting tales and a glimpse into past Irish society. There is a very good footnote section as well giving you valuable information about some of the terms and gaelic words used throughout the stories. The writing style is fluid and easy to read and quickly engages you into the story. I enjoyed the second and third tales the best. I liked the first one, but it was a little long and started to repeat itself.	2005-06-25
US	49517851	R5VAWO9VRZE1D	0060922583	161060786	The Holographic Universe	Books	3	23	28	N	N	Fascinating at times, but ultimately collapses	The first part of this book is fascinating as the author explains a theory of how the brain works like a hologram. Apparently if you cut a piece of holographic film, each piece still contains the entire object. The theory states that each section of the brain contains all of our memories and knowledge. Then it moves on to a theory of the universe as a hologram, stating that every electron actually contains all the matter and time of the universe. I'll admit I found the physics theory hard to comprehend. Fascinating, but hard to believe. These theories have been suggested by highly intelligent, well respected men in their fields which adds some gravitas to them. <br /> <br />The book started to lose me after this though. The author goes on to explain how you can perceive any number of phenomena through the lens of a holographic universe, including your health, miracles, psychokinesis, out of body experiences, near death experiences, stigmata and the list goes on. It started to sound like an infomercial  selling you on the merits of the holographic theory. The biggest problem was no real distinctive proof was offered. The book collapses under the weight of all the anecdotal evidence. Dozens of studies done by dozens of doctors are cited. Historical legends about mystics and holy men and women from the past being able to create things out of mid-air and leave their bodies whenever they wanted to. <br /> <br />I have always been fascinated by paranormal sciences and the possibility that it is possible to leave your body or see things of the future in your mind or that you can influence events just by thinking about it. But I haven't seen any real proof of much and this book doesn't offer it. The stories from 700 years ago can't be held accountable because of the length of time and the predilection for hyperbole from the people who recorded these events. The anecdotes from more modern history seem to be heavily from India and Indonesia. Why not more from industrialized countries? <br /> <br />By the end of the book you find out the author himself claims to have some of these paranormal abilities and then you realize why there isn't a counterpoint in the book. The author believes these theories whole heartedly and he's just  trying to get you to wise up. This is a well written book and at times fascinating and hard to put down. However, I would have liked a more balanced approach and more solid attempts at proof.	2005-06-19

He makes money hand over fist, still isn't really all that happy, and in the end it all falls apart. There is a lot of interesting information here about how lawyers go about fleecing innocent people and companies to make their millions of dollars and it moves along at a fast pace. It's an easy read and was interesting enough to keep my attention even though it was predictable. You can decide for yourself what comes next and in 100 pages it will have happened.	2005-06-14

A planetoid called Kirinyaga is set up as a utopia, so the Kikuyu people can live as their ancestors did before the Europeans inculcated their ideas into Kenyan culture. The driving force behind this is a man named Koriba who acts as their witch doctor/wise man. The villagers live in enough fear of him that they take his word as gospel even if in their hearts they disagree. Koriba is disingenuous however, as in his hut he has a computer which he uses to communicate with a Maintenance ship. Maintenance can change the position of the planetoid to give them the illusion of seasons or as in one story, Koriba orders Kirinyaga moved to cause a drought as punishment to the people for disobeying Kikuyu law. In the end the only person's utopia being created is Koriba's. He stifles thought and creativity, stubbornly and arrogantly forcing everyone to live by the old laws. New ideas are discouraged because that's not the traditional way and he seems surprised when people become bored and frustrated. The most emotionally compelling story is the one of a hyper intelligent young girl who when Koriba tells her he will not teach her to read because it is against Kikuyu law, she teaches herself . Then she creates her own language. He continues to stifle her and force her to live in only the ancient ways of the Kikuyu until she would rather not live at all. <br /> <br />Their is not a lot of style to the writing, but plenty of substance. Each story will give you a lot to think about and in that respect it is an amazing collection of work.	2005-06-13

The author did a good job of keeping you guessing and there was enough suspense to make you keep reading. However, the ending was a big letdown as was the eventual unveiling of the killer. The author also needs to work on making at least some of her characters likable. Sarah, the main protagonist was indeed psychologically screwed up but she was also a jerk. The two cops on the case were idiots and almost every ancillary character was unlikable.	2005-06-10

Porter has an amazing way with words and with characterization. With only a few sentences you feel as if you know the people in her stories. This book contains 3 short novels of which I think Pale Horse, Pale Rider is the best. Miranda is a young woman working at a newspaper during the last year of the first world war and of the tragic flu epidemic which killed millions. She goes from show to show every evening writing reviews for the paper, never sure why she bothers. She is alive, but not living. She dines and dances with a soldier she loves but knows the relationship is pointless as he is being shipped overseas in a few days. Then she contracts the flu and the end is a harrowing description of the effects of the disease. <br /> <br />Noon Wine is the second strongest in my opinion, detailing a small Texas family dealing with the aftermath of the father murdering a man. It may have been in self defense, but it might not have been, you are left with the question and the family is left with the guilt and shame. <br /> <br />Old Mortality tells of the sad life of Gabriel through the eyes of his two young nieces. The woman he loves puts him off for a lengthy time while flirting with other men. Finally, though she doesn't love him, marries him and dies 6 weeks later. Gabriel never completely recovers. <br /> <br />These novels are beautiful and sad, filled with complex characters trying to get through each day while figuring out why they are doing it.	2005-06-07

Later in life he believes he was abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Sometime after this he became unstuck in time, constantly shifting from one time period of his life to another. One minute he is in the POW camp, and the next he is on Tralfamadore and the next at home with his wife. Slaughterhouse Five is filled with absurd images and people and speaks to how we handle traumatizing events in our lives. It is an oddly structured book in that there is no real beginning, middle or end and constantly jumps around in time and place. It is worthwhile  to read this book for its absurd humor and deft characterization of Billy Pilgrim, but it does not strike me as the iconic classic it is made out to be.	2005-06-07

I thought the story was excting and was written at a brisk pace, no endless filler. The main character, Ryan, can be hard to root for at times, but in the end he has the best interests of the 1000 men he's leading at heart. I really liked the character of  Colonel Fincham who is insubordinate to Ryan at every turn. The detail of what it was really like in a POW camp were excellent, and the same goes for later in the story when the men are herded like cattle into train cars. Von Ryan's Express is a quick read and tells a compelling story.	2005-06-01

Adams tried to have a plot where the first 2 books didn't really have any, but it doesn't succeed. That could be forgiven were it as funny as the original Hitchhiker's Guide but it isn't. It didn't really start getting funny until about the last 70 pages and then the ending petered out, like he just decided to stop writing one day. The rest of the book is a lot of jumping around in time and space and a lot of decidely odd, but not necessarily funny names to deal with. All the characters are back but rarely together at one time. Zaphod completely disappears for dozens of page, Ford has become belligerent and annoying and after 3 books we still know virtually nothing of Trillian's personality. This book needed more work on character development and funny dialogue than all the cumbersome names.	2005-05-27

An American doctor, his mind lost, possibly from horrors he saw during service in the Civil War, moves to London to escape his demons. Since the demons are all in his mind, they remain with him and one morning it comes to a head when he shoots a man he believes was in his room. The man was merely walking to work at the wrong place and wrong time. Dcotor W.C. Minor is found to be insane and sent to Broadmoor Asylum for Criminal Lunatics. The only thing that keeps the brilliant doctor going is his books which he continues to collect. Through chance he finds a flyer in one of the books asking for volunteers to help compile the first Oxford English Dictionary, an undertaking that will span 70 years. Over the next 20 years Minor is instrumental in helping to edit one of the greatest undertakings in English literature. Because his correspondence was done through the mail, it's 8 years before the main editor, James Murray, finds out his most impressive helper is working from an asylum. After meeting him, they strike up a friendship. <br /> <br />This books flows beautifully through this story, giving you background on James Murray and Dr. Minor. You come to see Murray for the kind of person he is, who sees Minor as more than a man who has lost his mind. With Dr. Minor you realize how fragile the human psyche is. Over 100 years later, we can now treat illnesses like his, but still don't know what causes them. He spent 38 years suffering the worst paranoid delusions, but was also a major figure in a great literary achievement. I for one am glad someone brought this story to light.	2005-05-27

This is a very funny novel, very inventive and will stretch your imagination.  One caveat would be if you   know you don't like the British sense of humor, this book probably won't work for you. <br /> <br />Though it made me laugh a lot and shake my head at its ingeniousness, it gets 4 stars because of some basic problems in that there is virtually no character development and the plot is razor thin.

I was fascinated that someone virtually unknown to history invented something so meaningful. The author's prose was very engaging, interesting me in Harrison's personal life as well as his professional. The science is written in a way that it doesn't gloss over the facts but makes it understandable for those of us without a scientific mind.

An ultra-conservative group, trying to bring their kind of morality back to the populace, takes it upon themselves to ruin the reputations of actors and musicians who support things like gay rights, gun control and abortion  and if that doesn't work, they kill them in very public, very ugly ways. <br /> <br />This is a decent thriller that keeps the action moving and about half way through you have some trouble putting it  down. The overall writing isn't much above pedestrian but O'Brien knows how to layer a story to keep you guessing to an extent and how to ratchet up the action without going overboard. Some of the dialogue isn't great and their are a few too many characters to  keep track of but overall this is a solid suspense novel	2005-05-16

At nearly 700 pages, Fingerpost is overwritten which makes it very dull at times. A historical mystery set in 1660s England broken into 4 parts; each part the story told from the point of view of a different character. This leads to some repetition and not each story in equal in interest. I found the first and fourth parts compelling, but the middle 2 fairly uninteresting. And unfortunately when you find out the outcome of the central mystery, it isn't worth the wait. The author obviously worked extremely hard and did an amazing amount of research to write fluidly about a time period 300 hundred or so years in the past, but the book doesn't work. A story that turns out to be less than enthralling and the trip to get there takes way too long.	2005-05-08

I don't read a lot of fantasy but from what I know of the genre, this one has some refreshing elements. That being said, I only gave it 3 stars because for reasons I can't pinpoint, the book didn't totally grab me. While I wanted to read the entire book to find out the resolution of the story, I also had no trouble putting it down for several days at a time. When a book really has me by the throat I can't stop reading until I reach the end. Part of the problem may have to do with certain things one of the lead characters did that I didn't like and didn't think they had anything to do with the story. Without this prejudice, you may find the book more enthralling than I did.	2005-04-25

I really did not like the style Koontz wrote in for this one. The narration of the main character contained so many one-liners and jokey punctuations of his thoughts that it became annoying. I like humor mixed into the story but this was overwritten. It was like Koontz was working out material for his stand-up act.  <br /> <br />A small child is kidnapped in the middle of the night and the main character, having once been in love with the mother, tells her not to call the cops, he'll find the child. Right. He is very acquainted with the night because he has a disease that won't allow him to stand light, but I still didn't buy him being a super hero or something. He trails someone to an abandoned military base where he shoots at the guy with his trusty Glock 9mm that he carries with him. He misses and the guy gets away. As he continues the search, the Rhesus monkeys show up. Vicious, genetically-altered, man-attacking Rhesus monkeys; a product of a secret government program based on the main character's dead mother's work in theoretical genetics. <br /> <br />This is when I quit and picked a better book to read from off my shelf.	2005-03-02
US	49517851	R1QHVCWCPZ2RI6	0451205421	835415534	The Door to December	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A little predictable	Dean Koontz is a very good writer and definitely knows how to tell a story. This one isn't bad though it's predictable. I thought that I knew by page 100 how it as going to turn out. I hoped he'd hit me with a twist that would prove me wrong but he didn't. The strengths are well drawn characters and protagonists you can certainly root for. Some of the detective's dialog is very clever and sarcastically funny. Overall this is a good read, but not Koontz's best.	2005-02-21

Clancy's flair for telling an exciting story took a vacation on this one. The basic plot isn't very interesting to begin with and then he fills the book with pages of exposition on the environment and government and I felt like I was at a lecture, not reading a novel. The terrorist plots the group foil along the way to the main story are poorly executed. The team never misses a shot or takes a misstep while the bad guys are like Keystone cops. When you get to the main story, your boredom turns to laughter. It was like Simon Bar Sinister on the old Underdog cartoon and his plots to \\"ruuullle the world\\". Clancy has written some classic thrillers. Go re-read one of them.	2005-02-02
US	49517851	RF2ZYMWHGP8EP	0380789035	337033298	American Gods	Books	4	2	3	N	N	So close to perfect	It was difficult to not give this book 5 stars as I really enjoyed it and had trouble putting it down when I had to. The idea is a very original conception and I liked the main character and how he dealt with all the strange things that are happening. The imperfections are that its too long and wanders off story from time to time, and most importantly for me was the intimation for hundreds of pages that a big battle was brewing and then the ending instead was a pastiche of too many different elements and just kind of  petered out. All in all though, a great read.	2004-04-23
US	49517851	RNCC7GWUKRYYV	0451191013	575466033	The Regulators	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A very imaginative story	I'm a little baffled by all the lackluster reviews I'm reading about this book. While not perfect, it is a very good novel. It has more imagination than the last 5 books I've read combined. So much in the horror field today is the same thing I read ten years ago. I've never read anything quite like this. Also, King keeps feeding you little bits of information so you never completely figure out the whole story until he's ready to reveal it. Others have said it's too bloody and gory. While there is violence and blood, it is driven by the story and I have read alot worse. The biggest complaint I would make is that like 90% of King's books its too long. Apparently editors don't edit anymore.	2003-06-08

You get some behind the scenes info about how these low budget movies were made. Unfortunately you could get the same info from other books or the movie &quot;Ed Wood&quot;. Almost every character in the book is a fictionalization of a real person: Ed Wood, Bela Lugosi, Vampira, Anton Le Vey. I would have rather Kihn created his own people for the book. The writing is good in places and riddled with cliches in other spots.	2003-06-08
US	49517851	RPC2JPYVEDDEZ	0671739441	958613731	Mine	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Excellent psychological suspense	I have read enough horror and suspense novels over the years that I do not get shocked or scared easily. McCammon's character Mary Terror was a truly scary person. The opening scene she has in the book hooked me until the end. The rest of the book was a close look inside a very sick  and screw up mind. The only complaint I would make is the protagonist did not come off as the most likable person. She wasn't bad, but you didn't exactly pull for her with everything you had. You keep reading to get farther inside Mary Terror's head and then you're sorry that you did.	2003-06-05

He does an excellent job of weaving plot lines and keeping you reading until they all intersect. He has some very beautiful and elegantly black descriptions of the underground of New York City and the Serpent that is loose there. The only real problem I had was too much unuseful prose when the character Romeo was at the forefront and a rushed, vague ending. This was a very good story, but deserved better to wrap it all up.	2003-06-05

It's written in a difficult to read one-long-chapter style and the plot is razor thin, yet he stretches it out for hundreds of pages. There are a few riveting scenes. Unfortunately you have to plow through hundreds of pages to find them. Or do what I did and skim, skim, skim until you find something interesting to read.	2003-06-05

There are so many 5 star reviews here for Red I have to wonder if I read the same book. I was incredibly disappointed. The writing itself is nothing more than competent. The characters are cardboard cutouts standing in for real people and the plots are wholly unoriginal. The story seems to be there mainly for Ketchum to set up violent scenes just for the sake of having violent scenes.	2003-06-01

I am a very big King fan, but this has to go under the category of &quot;the book he never should have written&quot;. A premise that cannot be sustained for 300 pages and more importantly, it's boring. Read this only if you have made some kind of pact with yourself to read every one of King's books and then save it until last.	2002-12-21
US	49517851	R16ETHFMFKM9O2	0670858692	40528119	Rose Madder	Books	3	1	1	N	N	missed opportunity	The first half of this book is wonderful. Fully drawn characters, pulls you in immediately and the scenes of domestic violence and mental anguish are truly scary. Then you get to the second half of the book. I saw another reviewer called it 'a confusing mess' and I can't put it any better. Usually, the supernatural elements are the best part of a King book, but here it's like an uninvited houseguest. The narrative gets bogged down and by the time you get to the end you're in a quagmire. A good book, but it could have been so much better.	2002-12-21
US	49517851	R3FMSJYUCRIKCP	0451184963	179012025	Insomnia	Books	2	1	1	N	N	not one of his best	The idea behind the story is clever and ripe with possibilities, but this book just doesn't work. The biggest problem is, at 650 pages, it is way, way too long and at some points utterly dull. Just when you think you've hit the meat of the story, it meanders away like a lost dog.There are large chunks of boring exposition and bad dialogue and when you finally do start to find out what's going on, it gets repetitive. I'm a big King fan and think he's an incredible writer but this was a misfire.	2002-12-21
US	49517851	R25NIO8TGLVZIM	1568581505	549191476	Extremities	Books	3	4	6	N	Y	a writer too enamored with style	There are some very good stories in this collection. I liked The Neglected Garden, Teratisms and Angels in Love. These pieces have a visceral edge under the weight of the beautiful words. Koja writes in a lush, lovely, almost dreamy style but overdoes it most of the time. She writes descriptions that are so glorious I stopped several times to revel in the words. But then she will continue the description, sentence after sentence and sometimes into multiple paragraphs until you've lost the thread of what she was talking about in the first place.<br />Some of the stories I found just plain dull, others were confusing or had a terrible ending which ruined the story. More problematic was, I felt, a lack of a coherent plot many times. Too many of the pieces ended up as empty words. Beautiful words, but empty.	2002-10-13
