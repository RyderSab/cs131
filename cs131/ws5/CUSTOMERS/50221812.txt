Christie Golden begins with a startling and instantly catching slice of fantasy.  She then moves to a fantastic look at a complex world much like most people's notion of an Arab-Islamic society, but what starts with so much promise soon degrades into a very long pity-fest for Golden's poor, abused heroine, and her father who can't seem to get anything right.  The fantasy wavers under the weight of the sorry life.  Any action there would be in the book takes forever to begin, and then when it does come it seems choppy and disjointed.  Conflict resolution seems tacked on to the end of the book, as does the master enemy, this Emperor.   <br /> <br />I will admit to some curiosity about Golden's next book, and her start on this one is enough to make me read the Stone addition to what is obviously a series.  To be honest, though, it is Golden's wonderful character development of the spoiled, complex, and spiteful villainess that gives me hope that these books will improve.	2005-02-06

This was a tense, snappy, inventive book.  Gilman creates an edgy urban fantasy that sizzles with energy.   <br /> <br />The relationship between Wren and Sergei had just the right amount of tautness and uncertainty.  Added to the usual nervousness about disrupting a friendship, the two are also successful business partners.  That being the case, they are doubly careful to keep from ruining the delicate balance of their relationship.   <br /> <br />The mystery element is strong, the fantasy/magical element is well defined and established in the book.  Gilman even includes a \\"history\\" with founding father Ben Franklin (check out the Luna website for more info).  The story runs smoothly and manages to come to a good conclusion.  Though this is to be a series, the author doesn't need to string the reader along with a cliff hanger.  The strong characters and interesting world will be enough to have readers returning to Gilman's world.  If you liked this book, check our Gilman's story in the Powers of Detection short story collection along with favorites like Anne Bishop, Simon R. Green, and Sharon Shinn.	2005-02-06
US	50221812	R26ZKUKN6GP3IL	140120337X	375267410	Sebastian O (DC Comics Vertigo)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	old favorite	I was pleased to see DC released this early Vertigo/Wildstorm gem.  It was a lovely read originally, and its appearance in trade form delights the senses. <br /> <br />Originally a 3 part series, this graphic novel collects the issues of gifted writer Grant Morrison, who takes his deliciously Oscar Wilde-esque character Sebastian O from Bedlam (a hospital for the mentally deficient, the unwanted, and those with the tendency to make society uncomfortable) through his quest to find revenge for the betrayal which put him there.  Unlike the tragically confined Wilde, who attempted to flaunt and thwart society, Sebastian manages to pull off his rebellion with aplomb.  The book bends those narrow assigned gender roles with equal skill and wit.  Sebastian, Abbe, George, and Theo, the members of the Club De Paradis Artificiel will remind history buffs of the Bloomsbury group or the art circles of the Pre-Raphaelites.  <br /> <br />This title has its weak moments, thus the 4-star rating.  The humor occasionally covers flimsy points in the narrative, and the characters sometimes dip a toe into farcical archetypes of themselves.  All in all, however, this book is a must buy.	2004-09-28

The plot was well-strung, with tension and resolution in the proper places.  <br />What I didn't like, however, was that this was just Stardoc, with names changed to protect the innocent.  Rebel daughter with genetic anomolies, secret about her birth, controlling father with exact-duplicate-of-my-perfection complex, mother who talks to her after death, issues about reproduction, betrayal by some stranger she trusted the instant she met him, issues with the Jorenian &quot;Choosing,&quot; boyfriend with that strong Jorenian morality code, what about this is sounding one bit different from the first Stardoc book?  Um, well, she didn't wisecrack quite as much as Cherijo, but other than that, it was all too similar for my taste.<br />I bought this one, I'd probably get the next one from the library or borrow from a friend.  Not one I'd recommend to anyone who had already rad the Stardoc books and was expecting something new and different from SL Viehl	2004-02-14
US	50221812	RWAANCS0X8FL6	0425191788	301916690	Sunshine	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Best since DEERSKIN!	For the first time in several books, Robin McKinley completely captivated and enthralled me.  Sunshine is a fascinating heroine, and the world McKinley created is quite possibly the best urban fantasy I've read since Emma Bull's WAR FOR THE OAKS.  Sunshine goes for a drive and finds herself in the clutches of a bunch of vampires who leave her in a room with thier captive, Con, another vampire.  This is the core of the story, and also perhaps an analogy.  Sunshine draws her power and strength from sun light, while that same sun is killing Con.  <br />A life debt ties Sunshine and Con together and drives the rest of the book, from villains and secret government organizations to Sunshine's work, making cinnamon rolls.  <br />If there is a drawback to this book it would be in its tendancy to be a bit floaty and disconnected, short on description and details and sketchy when it comes to links between events.  This is a problem with a lot of YA fiction, so it isn't such a big deal.	2004-01-23

Bea and Phillip, Bea's best friend and her lover, Simon are all superbly drawn.

Ulric, the alpha male shapeshifting umpyr (read: vampire) of Holly's first book in this series, CATCHING MIDNIGHT, comes back.  In this book he meets his surly, sulking match with the perfect heroine, one who doesn't let him brood over his hurt feeling or his wounded pride (See CATCHING MIDNIGHT).  A little bt spoiled, she is on the run herself from a disasterous arranged marriage, and is fascinated by Ulric's charisma, and his strange powers.  <br />The secondary characters in this book, Ulric's pack, really make the book.  The dynamics and personalities really flesh out and enrich HUNTING MIDNIGHT.  <br />As to the world, Holly really unifies her themes and concentrates on one or two elements of the umpyr existance, instead of trying to explain it all, and that makes HUNTING MIDNIGHT flow and come together better than its predecessor.  This is a must read.	2004-01-23

The mystery falls flat, dropped halfway through in favor of the villain who will supposedly carry the next book.  There is no secondary romance.  There are no security facts, history of cat burgalars, little info on the jewelry, no high society foibles, no background information whatsoever.  It is just Quinn and Morgan for 300 or so pages of mass market paperback.  When it ends without even a resolution of the *irritating* romance I've been trying so hard to stay awake through for two books I threw it against the wall in disgust.	2003-06-14

I really was worried about romances by SL Viehl, since I found the romance between Chejiro and Duncan very creepy  in the STARDOC books, and after the first book, THE DEEPEST EDGE, I thought the books would go downhill.  <br />STEEL CARESS, however, was an excellent book.  Kalen and Raven, strong secondary characters from THE DEEPEST EDGE, have been enemies for a few years, and you really need to read THE DEEPEST EDGE to understand the story.  He was her commander, and after a disasterous mission in China he was the man she hated second most in the world.  Now the assasin who ruined her face has reappeared and Raven is willing to do anything to catch him, even work with Kalen, who is after him to stop a tong war.  The chemistry between Kalen and Raven was pretty strong.  It didn't exactly scorch off the pages, but their past relationship filled the unspoken moments in every page.  The mystery stays strong, and the author really juggles all of the elemnts of a complicated story with great skill. The secondary characters, too, were well drawn.  Val and her husband and Lily from THE DEEPEST EDGE make the occasional cameo, as does Sean.  Kameko, the heroine from the to-be-released third book also lights up the pages with a few flashes of spirit and fire.  It have a feeling that THE KISSING BLADES will be one to buy.	2003-06-13

Heck, it wan't even worth it for just my copy. The plot was flimsy, In fact, I couldn't even tell you what it was about. I think it was supposed to be cute and zany, but it was really just confusing. The mistaken-identity-aka-\\"you lied to me, I'll never trust you again, kiss me you fool\\" card was used up in the first few pages. After that, I don't have a clue what happened. Something about small town politics, professional wrestlers running for office, and other such nonsense. The editing and sentance structure was downright bad, and the characters couldn't hold my attention for 10 minutes. I ended up skipping to the end.

I loved Luisa's story in the FANTASY anthology.  That said, I'd have to say that I didn't care much for this book.  I think it had too many elements, ans was not nearly long enough to really tackle everything she tried to approach, plot wise.  The &quot;werewolves&quot; the shape-shifting, the animal bond, the vampirism, the transformation, it really tried to do too much.  <br />Plot wise, there were too many bit-players that the reader knew too little about.  Istead of concentrating on 2 major players and 2-3 additional minor characters, the author confused us with 2 main characters and 10-15 minor players who occasionally only appeared for a page or two.  <br />This book would have been much better if it was longer, and could go into much greater detail about the paranormal elements and the description of the characters, or if it was pared down and distilled to a much simpler story.	2003-06-12

ATF agent meets stripper in the shady wings of a Las Vegas night club stage. He's undercover taking off his costume, and she's putting one on, as a clown(?). Sparks fly, especially during the many, many practices for his act. Yum. No romance novel skimping with this stripper act. He takes it all off, down to the teeny, tiny g-string. I liked that Lane didn't have her hero behave all prissy about it. I mean, if you are going undercover as a stripper, go as a stripper, not a pole dancer with excess modesty issues. Everything else about this book was same-ol', same-ol', but Lane usually makes one element of her books brilliant and different, but sticks to cookie-cutter for everything else.	2003-06-12

She was fun, independent, and sassy.  She was the first romance heroine I've ever encountered with short, spiky dyed hair, a dog collar, and a navel ring.  She was everything most romance heroines are not.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find her unsympathetic at all.  I found her a refreshing break from the cotton-candy pink of most other romance heroines.  Her careless sexuality, far from being off-putting, was more based in reality.  If you like Carrie Brandshaw and pals of Sex and the City, you'd really like Riley.  <br />Where this book started to derail for me was when the hero, Zap, who I found to be totally arrogant and annoying, started to change Riley. Plain dresses and ordinary hair styles & color came first, along with the removal of her body jewelry.  At the end, it leaves the impression that only those cotton-candy-pink heroines who are demure and shy about sexuality deserve to be loved.  And that I don't like at all.	2003-05-22

Although DRINKING MIDNIGHT WINE, a books about a parallel magical world ala Harry Potter, is a real departure from Simon R. Green's space opera DEATHSTALKER series, it is still characteristic of the author.  Green's dry, homicidal wit is still in evidence every bit as much with Angel as it ever was with Hazel D'Ark and Ruby Journey.  Toby is every inch the bumbling, reluctant hero that Owen Deathstalker was.  The additions of Gayle and others only made the book richer and more unpredictable than the DEATHSTALKER books had a tendency to be.  This one is a must-read for Simon R. Green fans.

It was like a cross between Dennis Danvers's moody, contemplative and atmospheric WILDERNESS and LKH's kick .. and smart .. Anita Blake.

Elena is trying to live in the human world, but gets called back home into the stickiness of werewolf politics.  Armstrong doesn't down play the uber-alpha nature of male werewolves, but this isn't a romance, so her heroine doesn't have to struggle in a futile and irritating way, then give in for the sex scene and the lifetime commitment.  Elena is strong, but not agressively independant.  She is witty, but not uncontrolably brash.  She is wounded, but not broken.	2003-05-09

Antics such as stripping down to a native G-string in front of the female student body and that sheath!! In front of the President of the US, too.  Soon Leslie takes the trouble bound man to the country for a fox hunt to get him away from the spotlight, and from the goons who are trying to persuade her to keep him quiet.  <br />This book was cute and funny, but the title and the cover art are really the best things it has going for it.  Suspended disbelief was difficult, the characters were shallow, and secondaries were non-existent.  The plot was strung together over some very shaky ground that was entertaining, but hardly believable.  This book was flimsy, and narrowly missed being truly bad.

Surrounded by strange characters from the pompous, obsessive Twit, who can't remember her name, to the friendly, but suspicious Marcy.  BJ, the liar, Matt, the schmooze, Lunther Bell, the lurking partner, and his vindictive, vicious assistant.  Lonnie is managing to cruise through her days there, but the nights are tough, especially with her immature boyfriend Terry, the stand-up comedian, living in New York.  And then there is Dominick, the sexy computer guy who works at the firm two floors down from Twit & Bell.  He is sweet, considerate, and sinfully good-looking.  And Lonnie is confused.  Good thing her sister Peach is there to help.  When Lunther dies in the middle of the firm Christmas party and the irritating Detective Montgomery enters the picture, the cast of characters is complete.<br />This book is a must for any Crusie fans out there.  It is wry, funny, a little dark, and doesn't always run on the expected romance lines.  There are some eccentric characters, not all of which are completely developed.  Some of them get a bit confusing, and seem a bit on the static side, as if they are only there to serve their plot purpose.

She and Duncan Reever have settled into a caring, but slightly uneasy relationship (trust is going to be a problem when your husband sold you as a slave to some old pals).  Their daughter, Marel, makes the connection a bit stronger, as both love her unconditionally.  <br />Spring fever has overtaken the ship, as both Sqillip and Alunthri are thinking about parenthood, one with trepidation and one with longing.  Dreen and his Navajo girlfriend are also expecting, with unexpected results.  They have three planets to visit, Hawk's father's home world, Dreen's planet, and finally, Cherijo's \\"mother\\" Maggie's planet.  All three will present danger, confusions, and the unexpected.  Xonea, Cherijo's ClanBrother has some surprises for her, too.<br />This book was much more rewarding than SHOCK BALL, with its convoluted plot and bizarre characters.  The Stardoc books are really best when they are out in space, as this one is.  Marel was the most delightful character!	2002-09-17

My god, this woman should have &quot;Oh, what a tangled web we weave...&quot; tattooed on her forehead. She tells a never-ending series of ear-shattering whoppers about her non-existent boyfriend Dominic, her equally non-existent boyfriend Ace, and her ex-boyfriend Kit. She lies to her roommate, her parents, her sister, Josh, the guy she hires from an escort service to play Dominic, to Kit, her ex-, and to every major and minor character who crosses her path, with the sole exception of Tamara, who finds her out, and to whom she spills her lying guts, and to the real Dominic, who doesn't really count, because she never calls after he leaves a message on her machine. The whole plot of this book is strung on a web of lies so thick it stops being a tightrope and becomes more like a mine field of explosive and conflicting prevarication, you can't even explain it without becoming hopelessly mired in the muck yourself.  <br />The worst part is, she doesn't learn her lesson, even after the big truth explosion.  Nope, Sophy just feels miserable for a while, then tosses out more lies and just weaves new traps for herself.  Despite the pathological lying and the prerequisite Bridgett Jones weight obsession, however, Sophy does manage to get herself her own \\"happily ever after.\\"  <br />In some inexplicable way, however, I'd have to say I liked the book.  The plot was well-constructed, and the characters were convincing.  I even connected with Sophy in the rare moments when I wasn't yelling at her to just tell the truth for once. I'd say, buy it, but beware.	2002-09-02
US	50221812	R1LT0VUOBQY1MQ	0380812525	135421562	Ritual of Proof	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Changed my mind about DJ	Okay, here is the story.  Jorlan is in danger.  Someone dangerous is trying to manipulate a marriage, and seems to be using the mortgage on the family properties to control the family into signing the contract.  Green, who has seen and spoken to Jorlan and is attracted, despite, or perhaps because of the thrilling combination of innocence and passion, attempts to thwart the vile villain by tripling the bed-price and getting the contract.  Wedding night takes place, complete with virgin blood, and Jorlan is greedy to learn all about passion.  Trouble lurks on all other fronts with suspicion, distrust, and resentment brewing.  When, against Jorlan's will, a child is conceived, all seems to be falling apart.  Eventually, however, the two reconcile and form a strong bond.  They return to the city, a duel is fought, and all's well that ends well.<br />Sound like a typical regency romance?  It would be, if it weren't Dara Joy's Ritual of Proof.  Green is a woman, Jorlan a younger man, and the society is strongly matriarchal.  The first half of the book is a mirror-image regency, only the gender roles are switched.  Green even has a pleasurer (like a mistress) that she keeps in a house and under her protection.  Joy actually does a really good job with this, not going over the top at all.  <br />The second half derailed my enjoyment slightly, as Jorlan and Green leave the city and the book becomes more sci-fi (ala Anne McCaffrey's Powers that Be series).  It wasn't bad at all, not cheezy or silly, I just really liked the first part, and wanted the parallels to continue.<br />This really was a great book.  As much as I (still) hate DJ, I did really like this, and would recommend it to anyone here with few reservations.	2002-09-02

He has the same self-depreciating sense of humor, and the same wise-cracking bravado of Anita Blake, but not the over abundance of introspection.  Harry Dresden knows who and what he is, and does not spend a great deal of time bemoaning his difference from the rest of humanity.  Storm Front and the other Harry Dresden books are more action than character driven, and romance is way down on the list of importance.  The characters are intriguing, and reading carefully is a must, since their thoughts and their personalities are revealed not by what they say, but what they do.	2002-08-22

Despite her flaws, one finds one's self rooting for Libby in her harrowing experience with love and the commitment-phobic but beautiful guy vs the RING with the snobbish and bedroom-defunct rich guy.

This book has a sense of hopelessness to it that neither of the others contained, even in their darker moments.  Read with caution, and read slowly.  The bad guys are bigger, badder, and there are certainly more of them.  The problems start even before page one, and never let up, or give room for breathing or for Harry's usual wisecracks.  <br />Michael is a welcome character addition, especially when the only other returning male character, Carmichael, was killed in Fool Moon.  Murphy is noticeable by her absence, but I guess there is only room for 1 woman in Harry Dresden's life, as Susan, the reporter for the Arcane and Harry's love interest is more prevalent in Grave Peril.<br />This is a good read, but I can't help hoping that the 4th book in the series gives Harry a little bit of a break from the nonstop terror and evil.	2002-08-22

Fortunately, kindly Louise is there to offer her a place to stay.  Joanna quickly learns that she has been set up, and the Walkers are only too glad to teach her the joys of a good spanking.  As she leaves, she is handed a business card with an address that will help her take the next step.  Is every one of Joanna's moves after that are orchestrated?  Is every one she meets a member of the Continuum?  Is every encounter that takes her deeper into submission and punishment a part of an elaborate set-up?  And who is behind it all? Who is her mysterious \\"Master\\"? Major Walker? Her boss, Halloran? Denis Davidson, the odd American? Kevin Steele, her co-worker and adventurous lover? Cynthia, who teaches her the joys of loving a woman? You'll have to read to find out.<br />The characters are not deep, and the author has an annoying habit of fading to black during the sex scenes, but overall this is a great book.  The plot stays on base, and takes the reader through a fascinating voyage of discovery, and, with some introspection and feeling, into \\"the lifestyle\\" of BDSM.  It gives the reader a deeper understanding of the emotions and sexual feelings involved in pain and pleasure.	2002-08-13

I loved this one. It was fun, it was sweet and sour, (not as spicey as WWT). The humor was dark, maybe even twisted at times, which you'd expect from those Dempsey morals. The characters were neurotic (consider a household comprised of one forger, two conmen, one thief, one hitman, one depressed painter with a psycho cat, a sister with a [cheap] alter ego, her gay ex-husband and his absolutely normal, sane, and down-to earth partner, their daughter who keeps trying to date her career, and a matriarchal figure obsessed with double-crostics and a thing for tiny umbrellas). The plot was interesting and fun, think Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole in HOW TO STEAL A MILLION.  For all you WTT fans, Clea is back, and Davy Dempsey is soooo sexy!

Though few people have Kitty's exact problem, that of being the latest desendant of the town madame, and working every day in the restored cat house, Ridgeway does strike a cord with anyone who knows what it is like to be known for the deeds of one's ancestors or relatives, and not for one's self.  All Kitty wants to do is be seen for who she is, and to be understood apart from her family's reputation.  When she and Dylan spent a night together years ago, she reached for a glimmer of respectability.  Now he is back, and steaming mad.  <br />The plot is very thin, and Dylan is practically a cookie cutter hero, but something in Kitty's situation grabs the reader and makes them like the book despite its obviously weak plot and carbon copy characters. Try this one.  You might just like it.	2002-05-31

The author, Judy Mann, has daughters of her own, and as they came to her with problems in their own lives, the author realized that she could not protect them from gender bias and sexism.  So she set about to explore the difference. The book makes some sweeping statements, some of which seem challenging and controversial, but all the time she keeps things in persepctive, continues to tie the reader back in with the experiences of her own children.

From Storm's first auto-erotic scene which explores so many fantasies simultaneously, this book is a roller coaster ride of the erotic.  Storm is so sexy. He helps Abby explore sight, touch, smell, and taste with absolute sensual abandon. <br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars was a feeling that the characters here weren't as well developed as those in MENAGE.  There was a bit more gratuitous sex that didn't seem to have any relevance to the plot, or provide any real intimacy with the characters.  I would have liked to have seen a little deeper into both Storm and Abby to believe that they would really be happy together.	2002-05-31

She found the book a link between her self and her sisters, other teen girls.  It was a message to let her know that she wasn't alone.  Sara felt, however, that Dr. Pipher's book was still too clinical, too adult and removed from the actual struggles of modern life for young women.  At a young age, she decided to write, or at least edit, another book, allowing girls to speak for themselves. <BR> <BR>What Ms. Shandler created was a collection of essays, submitted by middle school, high school and college age girls all over the country, from all areas, races, and social strata.  The essays range over such subjects as physical appearance, eating disorders, parents, rape and molestation, sexuality, friends, feminism, school, and religion.  <br />Though the voices Ms. Shandler presents here are candid and outspoken, Ophelia Speaks, nonetheless, manages to present a more hopeful outlook on the lives and futures of young females in America today.  The problems are real, but the hearts and minds are strong, not fragile or weak.  The hardships are mostly spoken of matter-of-factly, from the pens of the girls who have all ready adapted to difficult circumstances.  Rather than promoting change in society, Sara Shandler sends her book out as a letter to all adolescent girls, simply to let them know they are not alone.  The only thing that this book asks for in return is that the reader listen without judgement, to the young females in America who simply want to be heard and understood.	2002-05-31

It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery.\\"<br />Using the illustration of shells from the sea, Anne Morrow Lindbergh clears away the clutter of life, pares it down to its most simple form, that of an internal life that lends clarity to the externals.  Each section of the book is a different shell, and a different lesson learned.  Peace within one's self, simplicity, clarity, joy, the validity of each cycle and era of a lifetime, strength, and wholeness are just some of the lessons she imparts.  <br />In about 50 years things have not become any less complicated, and this short, simple little book is even more relevant to our busy and noisy modern lives.  The lesson one takes away from the book is not how to get rid of all the things, but how to find a calm, still center within one's self to maintain sanity, and that need never change, no matter what the distractions might be.	2002-05-31

It was sweet, but not saccarine, light as air, but not frivolous.  Piper is an engaging character, and her eccentric family was  fun to read about, and I would like to have heard more from them.  Her relationship with Aerlvarin had that wonderfully vague quality that romances in YA fantasy posess.  The wise dwarf did not appear often enough in my opinion, and the evil just wasn't bad enough.  I did like the use of stories to define the Faerie, and the aunt's cottage and Piper's ability and presence reminded me of Mary Stewart's THORNYHOLD, which is one of my favorite books.  All in all, I'd say this is a must read.	2002-03-28

This one, however, lacked anything else intersting.  The Jack the Ripper history was fascinating! The diary and the scenery in modern day Whitechapel in London was riveting and for that poriotn of the book, I couldn't out it down.  Though I guessed within the first 50 pages who the killer was (and no red herring was convincing enough to throw me off track), I kept reading for Jack's diary.  When the book switched focus to the &quot;romance&quot; however, I quickly lost interest.  All mystery and suspense details faded into the background behind colorless and vague characters. I couldn't believe that Victoria was and FBI profiler any more than I could believe that Jonathan was Scotland Yard.  Apparently, neither of them ever had to work, or report to a superior.  I eventually ended up skipping about fifty pages of dull romance just to chekc and see if I was right about &quot;whodunit.&quot; I was, and then immediately threw this book in the pile to donate to my local library.

This is probably the finest thing I have ever read in print.  Mary Jo Putney's contemporaries know how to tackle the tough topics, but this one really blows the glass ceiling off the romance genre.  Forget the cover, and the teaser on the back, this book will blow your mind. <br />Though the plot description reads like any other husband-wife reconcilliation line, that is definiately not what this is.  Rainey asks her soon-to-be-ex-husband to do her a favor and star in a independant film she is directing, little realizing that some details of the life of the character (John Randall, a fictional British soldier) are too close to Kenzie's darkest places.  Raine herself is a pretty deep and intersting character, and the very realistic depiction of the world of filmmaking will keep you riveted, but the real star of the movie is John Randall, and the real star of the book is the actor who plays him, Kenzie Scott.<br />Kenzie Scott is nothing like any romance hero you'll read about anywhere else.  He is vulnerable in ways that no hero has ever been before, and he is a man spiraling down a mental path to self-destruction.  It's his story that grabs you and pulls you down with him as he falls.  Rainey is his lifeline, but it's Kenzie that opens up a world of pain and dicovery, and takes the reader to the depths and heights of the human heart. You have to buy this book, and buy a copy for your mother, and your sister, and if they will read it, for your father and brother.

I just am not sure she should be writing suspense. This was all together a too delicate, almost squeamish handling of the &quot;serial killer&quot; angle. If Ms. Garwood was reluctant to handle the gore, then she should have picked a different type of killer.  This is a dainty book, better suited to Victorian mystery than modern suspense/thrillers.<br />I'm afraid that the character's relationships suffered from the lack of actual tension. Nick and Laurent never seemed to me to be real characters, and their romance was wishy-wash at best. She lacked strength, conviction, and background information. As a counterpart, Nick was a little better, but there was still that lack of a strong past. It was hinted at, but never seemed to play a role in his life, and made me feel as if I was missing a previous book that explained some of these details.  Tommy was intereresting, but he seemed to fade into the background as the romance started taking shape, and I don't think he ever recovered his initial strength as a character. I did like Noah, and I would like to see him in his own book.  All of the characters seemed very static and flat, and the dialogue lacked snap and sizzle. All in all, if you can find it used, and have plenty of spare time, do read this one. If not, skip it and stick with Garwood's historicals.	2001-11-20

The details of this plot seemed less like a cohesive series of clues and mysteries as a misplaced jumble of bad adventure cliches, none of which was sufficiently developed to provide an actual plot. <br />Ace seems to hold all the cards, and he leads this tough 6-foot amazon of a woman through a series of hoops of his design while she alternately throws hissy fits, and falls into a sobbing heap. It was disgusting. He reveals pertinent facts whenever he so feels like it, and even solves her part of the mystery at the end. She was essentially useless. Both characters were shallow and static beyond belief, and minor characters were even worse. Avoid this one.	2001-11-05

Rather than just three short stories about Sam the Blue Angel and his old girlfriend re-united, Stan the ex-football star and the beautiful forester/football fan, and Kevin the bounty hunter and his fashion designer prey, thes three authors created a chapter format, switching periodically between characters. It was intersting, but I'm sorry to say that it didn't have the desired effect. Rather than creating continuity, the jumping really kept the reader from getting close to the characters and their stories. I never felt myself truely connect, and as a result, I couldn't really enjoy this book. It has it's cute and hot moments, but if you like to feel that the characters you read about are real, I'd skip this one.	2001-10-31

Paige detests Ross, the opposing attorney in her cousin's bizarre divorce battle, where the only disputed property seems to be a poodle. In the middle of an arguement, the courthouse explodes. In a transportation mishap, an ambulence on the way to the CDC picks Ross up, and he and Paige could end up with &quot;horny monk disease.&quot; <br />As things heat up in the very small quarantine room, the question on everyone's mind is: is it true love, or is it TCV? Some original sports lessons fail to enlighten these randy barristers, and when they get out, and Ross's divorce business starts going down the tubes, things get even more confusing. Are they, by chance, spreading TCV to the troubled couples of Atlanta? If so, is what the are beginning to feel for each other a viral illusion?<br />This is a funny, madcap book. It's plot is intersting, and the characters are endearing. The secondary romance between the doctor, Rachel, and Paige's brother is almost better than Paige and Ross. All together, this is a must-read.	2001-10-31

With the possible exception of the actress and the orderly, who do develop a relationship and show some concern and tenderness in their encounters, all of the sex in this book is just a roller coaster ride of graphic shocks and erotic-boardering-on-bizarre encounters. If that is what you are looking for, do buy this book, you'll enjoy it immensely. If you are looking for plot, however, skip this one.	2001-10-23

Julie comes from a much smaller town to a still-pretty-sleepy local newspaper. She splits amicably from her friend/boyfriend, makes some new friends, and nails everything in sight. From a fellow reporter with interesting ideas on delayed gratification, to a earnest young cop who is trying to be domineering, to the motercylcle-riding, philosophy-reading bad boy, Jon, to the fierce Monica. The characters in this book are pretty developed, the setting is more than backdrop, both the town and the news office seem real, and the background mystery plot stays within grasp, no matter what other hanky-panky is going on. Julie is unapologetic about her sexuality, and despite the variety and frequency of her encounters, it never seems truely gratuitous. This is a well-written keeper.	2001-10-23

I didn't feel that anal played all that large a role, and what was there was subtle. In fact, this book had most of the Black Lace required scenes: oral, anal, female-female, light BDSM from both sides, with the main characters as both dom and sub, etc.  Some of the scenes were gratuitous, though most seemed to enhance the characters. The reader gets a good look at the pseudo-Japanaese culture of the book, and partially gets to know Anabelle, a very unhappy, young woman, and Nakano, her master. The charaters are observed from a distance, though, and the author never lets you get too close to them, interrupting any sort of intimacy with a out-of-place sex scene.  The sex wasn't all that sexy, and the plot wasn't terribly convincing.  It was okay, but if you really want great Black Lace, read Emma Holly.	2001-10-23

I know romantic suspense needs a certain amount of suspended disbelief, but really!  Honestly, all you ladies who are reading this, if you were being stalked, watched, and terrorized by an insane killer, would you invite a strange man over for coffee? How about going outside to meet a total stranger? What if you'd seen this total stranger watching you? Would you then invite him in for a drink? No. Not unless you were a complete moron. You know, the kind that run down to the basement in horror movies.<br />I'm sorry. This might have been a perfectly great book, and I'm sure this man wan't the bad guy, but speaking as someone who never leaves her apartment without her pepper spray, it just seemed too foolish, and I had to toss the book down in disgust. There are risks that I can appreciate a woman in a romance novel taking, like trusting a man she had known for a while, even with over-whelming evidence that he is not trustworthy. But when you are in that much danger, and live alone, letting a man into your house, a man you've never met in your life and who you've only seen when he was watching you, that is too stupid for words.	2001-10-18

The characters were pretty good, but the plot was barely passable. It would take a healthy dose of suspended disbelief to buy this one. For one thing, the idea of the intrepid heroine being hired as a &quot;companion&quot; to a homosexual man is quite a stretch to avoid the romance novel taboo of having one of the characters sleeping with someone else during the novel. She is a virgin four years before when she picks up a stranger in a bar, then, after three days, she remains loyal to him for four years, even when posing as a &quot;kept woman&quot;? Come on. It's ludicrous, to say the very least.<br />There are all the curve balls thrown in towards the middle or end of the book. Delanie's pregnancy and miscarriage, for instance. It didn't add anything to the characters, it wasn't necessary to drive the plot, so why is it even in there? More words, perhaps? <br />Then there are all the minor characters, who, with the exception of the villain, are cardboard. They appear and disappear at a whim, friend and foe both. An otherwise weak book can be saved by secondary characters, but these are flimsey and apparently expendable.<br />The only reson this got any stars is that it was a fairly entertaining story. Still, I'd buy it used or skip it all together.	2001-10-11

It sends you back to the early Stewart works of THIS ROUGH MAGIC and THE MOON SPINNERS.  The reserved relationship between Alex and Celia, and the limited physicality of it, limited to polite kisses, were so much like Stewart, I was tempted to check the author's bio again. Even the subtle mystery, based on theft and smuggling, was signiture Stewart. It was a delicious trip into one of my favorite authors, and recalled my first romances.  This is a must have.	2001-10-10

Jazz is the new Lizzie Bennett, and Harry Noble is perfect as Mr. Darcy. Mellissa Nathan brings to light not just the most obvious, but also the subtle characteristics of Austen's characters.<br />Jazz and her sister and best friend audition for a new production of P&amp;P, directed by the great Harry Noble, actor extrodinaire. An initial overheard conversation sets Jazz's opinion of him firmly. Her sisters, George and Josie, the handsome and charming Wills, Harry's best friend Jack, Jazz's best friend Mo, and a oily former colleague complete the books cast of characters, and correspond perfectly with P&amp;P charaters.<br />I don't think that Nathan either watered down or fudged the original story.  Jazz and Harry are as strong as Lizzie and Darcy, only the setting changed.  Even the sense of humor was as subtle and clever as Austen's own. Definately a must-buy.	2001-10-10

Here's the story, weak-willed, spineless modern heroine meets domineering, chauvanistic alien in a very feeble attempt at a sci-fi/romance blend. Aside from the brief flash of humor that has the heroine bringing an alien to Worldcon, there wasn't anything to recommend this book. He tricks her into marrying him by some ancient tradition of his people, and then holds her to it. And she buys it!<br />He drags her against her will to his world, and tells her that she can't leave. And she buys it!<br />He changes her name. And she tolerates it! He dominates her, supresses her, refuses to listen to her point of view, or her opinions, or her desires, or even her choice. And she puts up a token resistance, and then gives in! The whole thing is full of platitiudes that closely resemble the &quot;A woman's place...&quot; attitude, and this supposedly modern woman, Deana, placidly swallows the whole thing, hook, line, and sinker. <br />God, it was so revolting! I'm sure that if he told her to clean house in high heels and pearls (ala Donna Reed) she would do that too. All in all, this book is a definite no no for anyone who was born after 1930, unless, of course, they missed the femenist movement completely. Perhaps Ms. Joy slept through it?	2001-09-17

For the life of me, I couldn't understand why anyone was doing anything. The characters were weak, and their motivations were non-existant. The choices they made seemed little more than weak plot devises to stretch the book out beyond a short story into a complete novel. From continent hopping to unplanned pregnancy to early marriage, to other problems, WILD ABOUT HARRY seemed to jump jerkily from one event to another without any explanation. The only reason this book got more than one star was because I did like the Ghost, and it was funny that the only time anyone in this book seemed even remotely real was when they werer chatting with the dead guy.

Still, there are some interesting, and not exactly stereotypical characters in this little mystery. I kept waiting for Webb to grow horns as the evil and snobbish southern old-money-turned-Senator, but he didn't. He, like all of the other characters, had their flaws, serious ones, but that only made them more approachable. Reed definately wasn't a gnetleman in disguise, Ella was naive about the people closest to her, her uncle was a snob, her aunt a lush and a &quot;loose woman.&quot; The various other sub-plots kept the story moving, and the secondary characters were all deeply interesting. The ending was a little too fairy-tale-ish, with everyone ending happily ever after with someone else, but at least it tied up all the loose ends. Definately a must-read.	2001-09-17

Memphis is a great modern heroine who doesn't back down, and solves her own problems, no matter what they might be. She's adventurous, courageous, and for once a romance author didn't create a strong female character who does a masculine job who comes across in the book as weak-willed, helpless, and in need of rescuing. Memphis is a war zone photojournalist who, despite problems, is able to trek into the back hills of West Virginia in search of her grandmother's (Sadie's) burial site, and to ward off unfriendly natives to find the killer.<br />Cutter's character is a bit less established. His motivations are nebulous, though interesting. I would have liked to know more about his background as both the richest kid in town AND the local charity case. From Cutter, the secondary characters seem to become even thinnner. Jake, Memphis's ex, is probably the best defined, but even he is weakly motivated. Three of the most important minor characters seem to disappear too early for a proper resolution, making for a slightly anti-climactic ending.<br />Still, all in all, this is a great book. Read it for Memphis, and for the look at rural areas remeniscent of Catherine Marshall or Sharon McCrumb.	2001-09-17

The Caracters were interesting, and it was good to see old Paradise, FL favorites, like Miss Mary Todd and her Hole in the Seawall Gang, and the DustBuster Brigade, who discover seamontster footprints in the prologue. The hijinx only gets worse from there, as Miss Mary concocts all inds of ways to keep her nephew, a prefessional phenonenon debunker, and Officer Sam Barrett together. Sea monster eggs, alien abductions, the z-files, and Godzilla references abound as a local crisis turns into a circus with Sam, who desperately wants to be loved, and Derek, who desperately wants to believe in something, right in the center. Miss Mary Todd is, as usual, on the sidelines pulling strings.

The action was well woven into an intricate and intense story that made it an all-night, I-can't-put-down-no-matter-how-early-I-have-to-get-up read.<br />All of the characters were so different than the tired romance novel norms that I felt a bit like Alice, falling through the romance into a completely differnt genre. Teri is capeable, but afraid of men. Stan is a fix-it man who doesn't think of himself as attractive. Though he is attracted to Teri, he spends almost the whole book pushing her away, or setting her up with someone else. Sam is macho and rough, with a wall a mile thick to keep Alyssa from breaking his heart again, while she is a sharpshooter who has to be falling-down drunk to spend any time with him.<br />If you a re a bit tired of typical, cookie cutter plots and characters, this book will renew your faith in the romance novel.

The Count has a secret, and badly needs Belinda's help to resore him to his beloved. Add two more sorceresses, one good, one evil, and you have a full house. Belinda and Jonathan develope their realtionship while Belinda agrees to help the Count.<br />If there is one hitch in this book, it is the tendancy to &quot;fade to black&quot; just when things are getting good. Any scenes much more risky than vanilla, they simply fade out, and some of the sexual potential is never fulfilled. Light BDSM, some very vague same-sex scenes. If you are looking for sexy, risky scenes, this isn't the book for you, but if you want a tender, interesting plot-driven story with some sex, buy this one.	2001-09-12

This might have been easier to take if, like the title suggests, it was based off the trite &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; tale.<BR>After the lovely Gwen is sarcrificed to the Beast, she falls in love with him. This part of the story was fine. Gwen is interesting, and her problems are funny and endearing. The Beast, too is a great character. I was enjoying the whole tale imensely up until the point where the Beast reavels who he was. Then it all fell apart. <br />Gwen makes an insuffeciently motivated decision on which hinges the whole rest of the plot. Then she makes another incomprehensible choice back in the opposite direction. It's like watching a tennis match where all of the balls go flying wildly into the crowd. If the author had given the poor girl a decent reason, and enough back-up for any of the choices she makes, the plot wouldn't have turned so weak only halfway into the book. As it was, everything hangs by a very thin thread.<br />I'd have to agree with the other reviewer. Medeiros should stick to books like A TOUCH OF MAGIC, which I loved! Even her spin of Cinderella, CHARMING THE PRINCE was great. This, however is a dud, made worse by it's destruction of one of the best stories ever.	2001-09-12

As usual, Emma Holly explores the issues of dominance and submission from both sides. A good ending, romantic, without being sugar-sweet.<br />Joe and Sean, Kate's boarders, are lovers. When Kate walks in on them, Joe eagerly expands the circle to include her, too. As the novel goes on, Kate (and the reader)gets to know both of them, and really understand and love them for who and what they are.

SErena might well be the best since JADE ISLAND. The minor characters of Erik's bosses were well-written, adding to the plot and the humor. The plot was evenly paced, though the suspense could have been taunter. It mixed the mystical with the practical, the past with the present in such a way that it kept you guessing.

Kerim is limited, but since the story is in 1st person, that person being Sham, he himself is less important than how she feels about him. The minor characters of Talbot and Dickon, and the selkie/stableboy add so much to the story.<br />The story of a homesick demon brutally murdering people was well written, and convincing.

All in all, I'd have to give this one a pass, if I hadn't already bought it. Unless you a rabid Robb or Hamilton fan who just can't wait for the next fix, you should too.	2001-08-10

The dog-in-the-pocket was funny, as was the sensitive Mrs. Danvers (who was fired from a previous position for burning toast.  They thought she was trying to set fire to the house).  If you are looking for a romance novel with something different to offer, you proablably shouldn't start with Lip Service, but if you are lloking for a mildly entertaining diversion to last you a few hours, buy it used.	2001-08-02

A good story, with well developed characters, Fast Women still missed the dark sense of humor that makes the rest of her books such a treat to read.  No one else writes quite the way she does, and the trinity of Tell Me Lies, Crazy for You and best of all, Welcome to Temptation create something very tough to live up to.  Though she writes the same real, and character driven story, with a off-beat and unbelievable mystery, the &quot;I can't believe she just said that...&quot; quality is missing, and I was vaguely disappointed.

Too bad he wasn't paired with a more memorable female lead, but Faith lacks spine. Recovering from a very weak chioce on her last boyfriend, I began to wonder halfway through if she didn't deserve the weenie after all. There was just something missing in her character.<br />The plot itself is pretty mundane, missing gems, bad guys, eccentric southern family with a history of abuse and other weird stuff.

This book is laugh out loud fall over on the floor and roll around funny. If you are female, and you don't mind a bit of (...ahem) bawdy humor, you won't be able to stop laughing. The conversations between Jaine and her friends, Sam, and the signs in the elevator, all of it is hilarious. The characters are refreshing and very real, almost as if they were people you know (in fact, some of them might be people I know, hmmm.) <br />Unfortunately, that is pretty much all there is to recommend the book. The mystery was predictable, every part of it, even down to who would die. The psychotic killer was remarkably easy to recognize, and though there was a bit of a twist, I had seen it by the middle of the book.<br />The romance was hot, very hot, but that was all there was to that, too. Though you liked both of the characters a lot, you never really got the feeling that they knew each other. They went from flirtation to affair to marriage in about five pages, all in the middle of the book, and though they seemed to like each other well enough, there wasn't much to tell me that this would last. <br />Anyway, read it if you want a really great, female laugh. Pick it up with a pint of Ben and Jerry's (preferably something sinful) and sit down to read. You will feel like this is a night out with the girls, where the jokes are dirty, and the calories don't count.	2001-08-01

I mean, if it is better than Lee &amp; Miller, it has to be nearly perfect!  Pilot's Choice, like Partners in Necessity, is an omnibus of two complete novels.  I won't bore you with a synopsis.  Suffice it to say that Lee &amp; Miller have created a believeable, intricate universe, some great, likeable characters that feel so real you could touch them, and some brilliant relationships.  Romance and Sci-fi really mesh well here.  The only draw back is that, in my opinion, Scout's Progress was about two pages too short.  I wanted to know what she would say when she found out who Daav really was, but c'est la vie (shrug!).	2001-07-30

I mean yes, the heroine does have sex with every man she comes into contact with (except the one interesting one), but none of it is in any way explicit, or even kinky.  I've read racier stuff in women's magazines.<br />The story is that the heroine goes to some SA country as a spy for an unrealistic British government org. She is punishing herself for a nebulous &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot; type experience in her past. She meets the power behind the gov in this tiny fictional country, and he wants her as his whore.  He treats her badly,insulting and cruel, but not particularly new or interesting. Despite how he is billed, as controlling and domineering, there's no BDSM.  In fact, they are just petty cruelties, making her wait, dragging her away from parties or from surgery, things like that.  Once he has her arrested and you thin &quot;Boy oh boy, here it comes, but that fizzles, too.<br />The story isn't bad.  It seems to flow well, but lacks depth.  All in all, I'd skip it.	2001-07-30

I've read some of the most revolting trash possible, and the eternal optomist in me leads me to push on, in the hopes that it will get better. I guess I expected more from this book, seeing as how it is Nora Roberts.  I love Nora Roberts!  I devour every book she writes as soon as they hit the stands, and since I started late, I backtrack to get a hold of her old ones, but this is the exception to a so-far unbroken rule.  <br />I found the dominating hero both tedious and typical, and the way he spends most of the book handcuffing the heroine to every available surface quickly gets old. Still, what I hated most of all was how she let him do this to her. She is supposed to be a blackbelt, and yet she continues to let him push and pull her instead of planting her feet and DEMANDING that he treat her as an equal. If you like Nora's usual way with independant, interesting heroines, you'll definitely want to skip this one, but if you don't mind weak-willed women and domineering men, by all means, buy it and read it...	2001-07-16

I mean, I know that science fiction is the best vehicle for exploring ideas and encouraging social change, but this wasn't even subtle.  This was just one whiney woman spending several hundred pages preaching aganst war, falling in love, screwing up, and having her life saved over and over (and over, and over).  I lost count of the number of times she &quot;died&quot; and had to be urgently recussitated by our convienient hero.  <br />He was nominally more interesting, but not enough to drive an unbearably weak story.  The idea that planet destroying nuclear bombs (which were set off by accident?) created some peaceful society of people imbued with magical gifts was both implausible and sad.  <br />Not to say that unbelievable worlds make for bad science fiction, look at Terry Pratchett's Discworld books.  This one might have been caried by stronger and more likeable characters, a longer story with less emphasis on the sappy romance plot, and/or some depth.  As it was, this was a pathetic attempt at a romance/sci-fi blend that did neither well.  If you want a good blend, read Sharon Shinn, but definitely avoid this one.	2001-07-13

Alex is a a reporter/sleuth, with and intensity that lies somewhere in between Eve Dallas' brutal dedication (JD Robb's &quot;In Death&quot; books) and Stephanie Plum's bumbling ineptitude (Janet Evanovich-&quot;One for the Money&quot; etc.)  She stumbles on the second body, but her brilliant intuition leads her where she needs to go (sort of).  She doesn't have quite the drive and ambition, but neither does she wish to.  She loves her small town life, her friends, and her position as the second best reporter on a small college town paper.  <br />The book really does it's best work on the relationships between the characters, and on creating the very believable atmosphere of a college town in upstate New York.  This was the first one of Ms. Saulnier's books taht I've read, but I just bought the new one, &quot;The Fourth Wall.&quot;  Already, it has moved to the top of my TBR pile.

The plot was a mildly interesting tale of a girl and her new-boyfriend's ex-wife's horse. You follow? No? Well, the lovely horse that seems to be the lynchpin for the whole story actually belongs to the hero's vindictive ex-wife.  The best part of the story, however, was the brother.  I hope that Ms. Moore has plans to write his story, because I would very much like to read that one.  <br />All in all, if you can find it used here on Amazon, buy it.  If not, well, you're missing a mildly fun way to pass a little time.  If you want some good books of the type, however, you might want to try Michelle Martin's &quot;The Long Shot&quot; or if you like a little suspense, &quot;Hunter's Moon&quot; by Karen Robards is absolutely wonderful.	2001-07-13

Why even bother to make a heroine an intelligent, competent, capeable woman, repected by her peers and very good at her job when no more than fifty pages into the book you are going to turn her into a flake? Honestly, it was like an alien abduction. A practical, professional ad-exec buys a powder blue Mercedes and proceedes to not have a single thought for the rest of the book. Tess goes west, and mutates somehow into a mindless, helpless, sniveling being, whose only purpose for the next 250 pages is to be repeatedly rescued by the domineering, though sexy, hero, and show up in time for the sex scenes. <br />And as if that weren't bad enough to make the book worthy of being sat on by an elephant, the plot is jumbled and convoluted, with several extremely flimsey mysteries that hold water like a whiffle ball and quickly disolve into thin air. Where exactly was this money supposed to have come from? And at this point, does ANYONE really care, since the money thing has been dropped, too. The only good thing about the book was Tess's past life regression to an Anasazi cliff dweller, but that also disappeared about half-way through, leaving the reader with out a single excuse for having wasted about three hours of my valuable time.	2001-07-13

Well, you go and fall in love with a man who only wants to meet a normal woman, of course! <br />This is a clever, inventive romp, with believable characters (mostly!) and some hilarious scenes (Zoe has x-ray vision. Wow!  Guess the age old question of boxers of briefs isn't much of a mystery.)  Talking ferrets, a missing belt said to make the wearer irresistable to men, some really ugly henchmen, an over-protective brother who models for romance novel covers, and a heroine able to leap off of tall buildings in a single bound, it all adds up to a lot of fun!

I was getting rather tired of romance novels, as the all seem to be very much the same, but if Kylie Adams is going to continue to write them, I might just keep reading them.<br />Sophie is a great character, so chock full of flaws that she even seems like someone I could meet at teh make-up counter of MY local department store.  Ricky and Debi, her co-conspiriters are great, too.  Very funny, but with problems of their own, and things that they need to work through.  Ben is a riot, sexy and funny, and I love the way he talks! And his friends, especially Kitty (I would like to see Ms. Adams write a book about her, I think she would be a great heroine, refreshingly uninhibited), are frank and easy to relax around.<br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was the \\"Fairy Tale\\" quality to teh ending.  The couple fall into marriage, and then fall into love, and then fall into success all without a major hitch in sight.  Still, if you can suspend your disbelief for the three-hundred-or-so pages, this is a refreshingly original romance novel, with slightly raunchy language, and some very great major and minor characters.	2001-05-21

Where the Dark Room and The Echo and all of her other books are intricate puzzles, bending and twisting in on themselves, this books was sadly plodding and straight forward.  <br />At first, I found the mystery of the dead woman, and the lost little girl to be tense, but the tension rapidly disappeared into boredom.  It took me two weeks to read this book, and it never takes me any more than four hours.  The back and forth red herrings that led first to the husband, then to the boyfriend, and back again got tired very quickly, especially as none of teh twists were either original, or unexpected.  <br />The only good characters were the rural policeman (his mild romance with the owner of a local stable barely keeping her head above water was the only really interesting part of the book.) and the dead woman, and then only real mystery was teh sea itself.<br />If you want a good mystery, read The Dark Room, or The Sculptress.

After what I thought of as a very poor showing in &quot;Judgement in Death,&quot; I was so glad to see Eve back in full force in this one.  The mystery was well-plotted, and ran smoothly throughout the book, and my favorite part, Eve and Roarke's relationship, really went somewhere in this one.  Eve's concern for her husband's life, and her reaction to the loss of his people showed significant growth in her role as a wife, not just &quot;Roarke's cop.&quot;  Slowly, over twelve books, the two of them have manged to meld themsleves into a unit, seperate and distinct entities, but still a cohesive team.  <br />Now that the two of them can work together, I expect great things of their detective work!  With Roarke's gift with the shadier side, and Eve's dogged pursuit of law and order, they can stand for the living, and the dead.<br />Fabulous book, even if you haven't read the other eleven (Didn't that review say TWELVE?

The mystery, far from being, shallow and gorey, like some American thrillers, insteady takes it's tension from a deep, involved and complicated series of realtionships and webs of lies that intruige the mind. <br />The story begins and ends with a mother taking her daughter on a walk through the WWI battlefield monuments of France, and explaining what has consumed her for most of her life: who her father was.  The answer, given to her by a strange old artist, will surprise you.<br />If you want a deep, intelligent mystery, you must read this book!	2001-05-18

There is a flaw in the plot, but it is more than made up for by the great relationships, strong characters, and snappy lines. <br />Daisy is strong and independant, and for once an author didn't put a female lead in a tough profession, and then have the hero rescue her. Nick hired her to protect him, and protect him she did.<br />Nick was also a great character. Life changed him from a spoiled rich boy into a working man.

I missed some of the minor characters, Dolph, Jason, the wereleopards, and especially Asher, but I didn't miss &quot;the boys&quot; at all.  I think that Anita really needed this break from her vampire and werewolf lovers.  Jean Claude has been with her from the beginning, and Richard came along not long after, so it's really great to get a chance to get to know Anita away from the stress of trying to choose between the two of them.<br />And the glimpse into Edward's &quot;Ted Forster&quot; alter ego was well-worth the elevated violence and gore.  Seeing Edward, the man the Vamps call &quot;Death&quot; even has a girlfriend with kids and dogs!  That might just be the scariest of all.<br />The vamp club is same-old-same-old.  I would've liked more details about the obsessed Professor Dallas, and about Obsiadian Butterfly herself.

The main character, Sophie, was impressive at first, being independant, intelligent, casually sexual, but her realtionshipwith Ty seems to fade into the background behind a mystery that never really takes off.  <br />Sorry, Nora!  I'm a very big fan, but this one wasn't really your best work.  If you havent read it, save your money and buy Carolina Moon when it comes out in paperback this month.  Now that one was worth rushing to the nearest bookstore (about 100m away)!	2001-04-04

If you've ever read LM Alcott's &quot;Long Fatal Love Chase,&quot; you might recognize bits and pieces of this book.  Granted, this book was no where near as intense or indepth as LFLC, but the general pall of violent obsession that hangs over the plot is slightly remeniscent.<br />Of course, the suspense could have been tighter, and the obsession darker and more complete.  The villan was scary, but not dangerous enough.  With his money and influence, he could've done a lot worse than he did.  With one hand, he boosts Joanna's career, helps her friends, and assists her family.  He could have easily taken it all away, or worse.  Instead, he resorts to petty phone calls and violence, which I thought was uncharacteristic of someone so smooth and arrogant.<br />Still, I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and I plan to read more.	2001-02-26

The romance was light, with little conflict, and even less interest.  The 2 main characters, started out well (you'll just love Annie at the beginning), but by the middle they were flat and unmotivated.  And the end was so anti-climatic!  Everything romantic in this book after the shopping scene (with the possible exception of the carnival) was dull as ditch water.<br />The saving grace of this book was the minor characters, a druggie-doctor, a lawyer who cheats at golf, a stiff butler, and a whole passle of relatives so coniving they get tangled in the strings from thier own plotting.  Over it all sits Archie, the patriarch, and he is so dispicable, you really can't decide whether to love him or loathe him.<br />Anyway, read it if you have some time to kill, and you want a light, funny book with little to no involvement	2001-02-23

The characters were fairly good, the story OK, minor characters were interesting, but had no presense, and were completely dropped much too soon.  The inaccuracies were there, but not such a big deal in such a non-serious, light book.  <br />It didn't stand out to me, either good or bad, but was somewhere in a gray area of &quot;entertaining, but unremarkable.&quot;	2001-02-23

I gave it to mys sister, without telling her what I saw, and she got the connection too.  I mean, the small, southern town, the death, the separation, the children of both the founding family and of the resident white trash, the hero's sister.  All of it was eerily familiar.  Even Robert's inclusion of &quot;the sight&quot; smacked of Linda Howard.<br />Still, the comparison didn't disturb me.  I love Howard, and I liked &quot;After the Night,&quot; but this was so much better.  All of the characters were more appealing, and the story was stronger, and much more sympathetic.  in ATN, there was a vicious arrogance about the hero, and an old, cruel conflict that I never felt was fully resolved, or that he was ever even really sorry for.  <br />The characters in CM are stronger, and much more grown up.  They have conversations that last more than ten minutes at a time,  don't solve every problem with hot, hard sex, but make a connection on a more intellectual level. So, yeah, they're similar, but this one comes out on top!	2001-02-22

It tried too hard to be both a romance, and a mystery, and so did neither very well.  The romance worked well in the beginning, creating a convincing tension between Genna and John.  He left her to get his life straightened out after a brush w/ a serial killer, but he failed to tell her where he was going, or why.  Genna has her own issues with abandonment, and she was crushed by his leaving.  At the beginning of the book, we find them struggling to be friends and co-workers again.  There is no bitterness, just a wary feeling between John, who loves her deeply, and Genna, who is cautious about getting involved again.<br />Then, in the middle of all of this, we follow the characters though a series of unrelated cases, none of which ends up having ANY bearing on the book later, losing any hope for a passable romantic tension. 3/4 of the way through the book, we finally pick up the main suspense plot, and the romantic angle resolves itself abotu fifty pages BEFORE the end!  The entire conclusion was both anti-climatic and flat.<br />I was so impressed by BEG, I will give Mariah Stewart another chance, (though I might not rush out to by the next one new) and I hope that she is still getting an angle on romantic suspense.  If she writes another like BEG, she will indeed be the new star of the genre, but she'll have to do much better than this one.	2001-02-12
US	50221812	R3TE6ZBHBSIWVI	0671034065	142020743	Mr. Perfect	Books	3	1	1	N	N	VERY, VERY FUNNY	This book is laugh-out-loud-fall-over-on-the-floor-and-roll-around funny.  If you are female, and you don't mind a bit of (...ahem) bawdy humor, you won't be able to stop laughing.  The conversations between Jaine and her friends, Sam, and the signs in the elevator, all of it is hilarious.  The characters are refreshing and very real, almost as if they were people you know (in fact, some of them might be people I know, hmmm.) <br />Unfortunately, that is pretty much all there is to recommend the book.  The mystery was predictable, every part of it, even down to who would die.  The psychotic killer was remarkably easy to recognize, and though there was a bit of a twist, I had seen it by the middle of the book.<br />The romance was hot, very hot, but that was all there was to that, too.  Though you liked both of the characters a lot, you never really got the feeling that they knew each other.  They went from flirtation to affair to marriage in about five pages, all in the middle of the book, and though they seemed to like each other well enough, there wasn't much to tell me that this would last.  <br />Anyway, read it if you want a really great, female laugh.  Pick it up with a pint of Ben and Jerry's (preferably something sinful) and sit down to read.  You will feel like this is a night out with the girls, where the jokes are dirty, and the calories don't count.	2000-12-18

This book was on a &quot;LIST&quot; that I found while I was looking for something completely different.  The person who recommended it had also read and loved some of my other childhood favorites, like Robin McKinley's The BLue Sword.  I figured I would give it a try, and I was very glad that I did.<br />The Perilous Gard manages to straddle a fine line between historical fiction and fantasy, taking the reader to pre-Elizabethan England, and to a world where superstition is not entirely unfounded.  Pope also straddles the line between fear and awe for the Elven folk.  Without actually liking them, or what they have done, her heroine feels sorrow for a world and a time lost, that can never be regained.<br />The only reason that this book didn't get a 5 was that it could've been 100 pages longer, and I still would've loved it.  The other characters needed a chance to develop more depth, and I would've liked a little longer in the Faerie world.  Still, if you are an adult fan of YA fantasy books, like Quest for a Maid, or The Blue Sword, you should read this book.  And if you have children who read fantasy, and want a book that is fantastical, and yet still grounded in reality, buy this one, now!	2000-12-18

There are two side of the issue, and a stunning debate that I'm not really qualified to approach, so I'll just say this:  Jordan doesn't have an evil strong enough to carry 13 novels.  He started well (really, really well), but the whole thing is getting old.  And the inactivity! It's like Shakespeare stretching Hamlet out for aproximately 8,000 pages, it just isn't happening.<br />I agree with the other reviewer that action is not the most important ingredient of a fantasy novel, but it is an ingredient. If there was an evil strong enough, this would work (maybe), but there isn't the &quot;presence&quot; that drives good, and without it, it loses urgency, and falls flat.  For heaven's sake, I practically fell asleep reading the TEASER!	2000-12-18

The characters are real, the world is problematic, but richly textured.

I can tell that this series is going to be one to read.  It'snot as dark as Laurell K.

I've only had this book a month, and already I've read it twice.  There is a great give and take between the characters that keeps you reading to the last page.  There is a flaw in the plot, but it is more than made up for by the great relationships, strong characters, and snappy lines.  <br />Daisy is strong and independant, and for once an author didn't put a female lead in a tough profession, and then have the hero rescue her.  Nick hired her to protect him, and protect him she did.<br />Nick was also a great character.  Life changed him from a spoiled rich boy into a working man.  He is cautious, but once he makes up his mind, WOW, does he ever try to show his love.  That is, if Daisy doesn't kill the FTD delivery man before she gets the message.	2000-11-22

Once again, Lowell saves a tired plot with clever banter and one likeable character.  Owen is, for me, the best male character of the series.  He is warm without being mushy, savvy without being hard like Archer.  Even with his recent injury, he manages to be extremely tough to kill. <br />Too bad he wasn't paired with a more memorable female lead, but Faith lacks spine.  Recovering from a very weak chioce on her last boyfriend, I began to wonder halfway through if she didn't deserve him.  There was just something missing in her character.<br />The plot itself is pretty mundane, missing gems, bad guys, eccentric southern family with a history of abuse and other weird stuff.  The resolution of the conflict also lacks sizzle.  Faith, proving once again what a flat character she is, caves competely, without even an attempt at assertiveness.<br />There wasn't as much information on rubies as I have come to expect, either.  I missed the soundbites of lore and legend, coupled with the gemacological tidbits<br />The improvement I would suggest is for Owen to leave Faith, meet a woman with a bit more oomph, and have a rough and tumble courtship that doesn't involve steroetypical bad guys (The Mob, come on!).  Now that would be a book worth keeping.  This one, I fear, is defintitely one to recycle.	2000-10-25

Namely, dark, hard, mysterious, and even a little on the cold side.  As honorable as Archer is, though, I thought that Hannah McGarry deserved a little better on her second time around.<br />The info about Pearls was, as usual, fascinating.

I read a review here that said that this one was the dud of the series, and that one might as well skip it completely and go directly to Blue Moon.  I disagree heartily!  Granted, the supposed main plot, the fires, quickly fade to the background, and I thought the fire man would play a bigger role, but the Vampire Coucil was more important.  Plus, it is traditional for the initial case of the book to fade into the background for the bulk of the book, and then pop back up toward the end.<br />Asher was an incredible character, and I really look forward to seeing more of him.  I hope he develops well.  I also hope for more development of Anita's abilities, which she uses to great success. The wereleopards are going to be important, too.<br />And the council? Well they can be summed up in Anita's words. &quot;Incredible power, near eternal life, and they were petty.  How disappointing.&quot;	2000-10-25

The characters are more developed, deeper and more complex.<br />Anyone who has ever been trapped between two worlds, never really belonging in either, will understand and love Lianne Blakney.  She is beautiful, funny, and intelligent, but also deeply hurt by her family's disregard.  Lianne is also full of useful information about jade and chinese culture.  If you leave this book without having learned something, then you should probably read it again.  I found it fascinating.<br />Kyle Donovan was burned pretty badly in the first book, and is wary of women.  His self-depreciating humor is endearing, as is his wary concern for Lianne.  The setting was also worth the cover price.  I love Seattle, and the entire Pacific Northwest!<br />All in all, this is a much better book than the first.

Finally, a book about old friends where the heroine hasn't been pining for the hero since she was ten!  Sam is independant and quirky.  She discovers that love can bloom from friendship, but she didn't spend the interim waiting miserably (and virginally) for him to turn to her.  Sam lives her own life, and has all along.<br />The part of the other woman was original also.  Whitney and Sam genuinely are friends, and Whitney has quirks and problems of her own.  She isn't all perfect, and she isn't all evil witch, the truth lies somewhere in between, in reality.<br />Cullum is the only tiresome character, but Sam and Erin, Sam's sister, and Whitney, and even Neal Beaumont (the other man) were so refreshing that I didn't mind.	2000-10-10

Though it seemed a bit darker and more serious than her previous books, I found that same quirky sense of humor that brought us the scene where Leo Friday reads the romance novel.

It deals well with the secondary characters, including the heroine's alter ego.  Lastly, his reaction to the revelation was devoid of the usual temper tantrums so common to romance novels when one of the characters finds they've been lied to.

Here's the story, weak-willed, spineless modern heroine meets domineering, chauvanistic alien in a very feeble attempt at a sci-fi/romance blend.        Aside from the brief flash of humor that has the heroine bringing an alien to Worldcon, there wasn't anything to recommend this book.              He tricks her into marrying him by some ancient tradition of his people, and then holds her to it.  And she buys it!<br />      He drags her against her will to his world, and tells her that she can't leave.  And she buys it!<br />      He changes her name.  And she tolerates it!         He dominates her, supresses her, refuses to listen to her point of view, or her opinions, or her desires, or even her choice.  And she puts up a token resistance, and then gives in!          The whole thing is full of platitiudes that closely resemble the &quot;A woman's place...&quot; attitude, and this supposedly modern woman, Deana, placidly swallows the whole thing, hook, line, and sinker.  <br />      God, it was so revolting!  I'm sure that if he told her to clean house in high heels and pearls (ala Donna Reed) she would do that too.  All in all, this book is a definite no no for anyone who was born after 1930, unless, of course, they missed the femenist movement completely.  Perhaps Ms. Joy slept through it?	2000-09-22

The mystery was  interesting, but the lives of the characters remained static.  Even the  dialog, funny at times, seemed a bit stale.  <br />There was no progress in  their relationships.  Eve and Roarke have a fight, and the making-up covers  more than half of the personal aspect of the book, but it wasn't anything  new.  Peabody and McNab make NO progress at all.  <br />As for Eve's past, the  one new developement came late in the book and seemed tossed in as an  afterthought.  Coming on the heels of Witness, which was brilliant and  satisfying on all levels, I would have to say that Judgement, which will  have to hold me for at least six months, was a let-down.	2000-09-12
