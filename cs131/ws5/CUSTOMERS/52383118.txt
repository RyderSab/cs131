The audiologist who confirmed the hearing loss was of the \\" deal with it\\" school.  I needed more than that.  My greatest source of help has been the American Tinnitus Association (ATA.org) and this is a book produced by them.  If you are experiencing this phenomenon or if you have someone in your family who is, this book is a terrific source of information.  It is done in a question and answer format and I can almost assure you that any question you might have is covered in this book in some fashion or another. And the reader is never made to feel that they are stupid for asking \\"that\\" question.  It was very helpful to me.	2005-03-24

If you want financial planning advice--frankly, go elsewhere.  But if you want help in dealing with all of the emotional stresses of retirement, then this is THE book for you.  I found it, by accident, on the first day of my retirement and it has been a God send for me.  While the transition for me has not been easy, the approaches undertaken by the authors have helped me clarify my thinking on many occasions.  Give it a try!	2005-03-24

I have read certain sections of it 3 times already and find them as compelling each time.  This collection of four seasonal essays contains so many examples of wonderful writing that I am amazed that this book has not received more attention than it has.  I was raised in New England, but I \\" know\\" many of the people and situations that Koozer is so eloquently writing about.

There are not enough superlatives available to apply to this collection of short stories. Quite simply, if you read no other book this year, this is the one to read, in my opinion.  I am not usually very impressed with Pulitizer Prize winning literature.  But I will make a real exception for this one.  Maybe it is because I grew up in the world of Northeastern universities and colleges that I find this collection so appealing.  Maybe it is because I live on the border now and hear countless stories of emigration.  Whatever the reason, I have rarely been as moved or as pleased as I was with this collection.

The 5 stars are not given for that.  But he has written one of the finest books about what it is like to discover the importance of nurturing a dog in one's middle age that I have ever read.  I went through this book cover-to-cover on a cross-country airplane trip last week.  My seatmate probable wondered why I was underlining so many sections while alternating laughter with tears.  But such is the nature of this book.  I was adopted by a &quot;lab-chow&quot; mix two years ago and she has changed my life in many positive ways.  Jon Katz captures all of what I have experienced so very well.  If you hate dogs--stay away.  If you are new to dogs and wonder why your life is being turned upside down--then this is the book for you.	2003-08-02

I have the time and the inclination then.  Ed McBain usually has one novel on that list every summer.  This one isn't bad--it just doesn't end up doing very much.  It may strike McBain as interesting to base a whole novel around the weeknesses and prejudices of Fat Ollie Weeks.  But seeing the world through his eyes is not a very pleasant journey. Even as a minor character he had little to offer except for his consumption of food and his prejudicial thoughts.  In this novel he has a bag with his own police novel in progress stolen This comes very early in the novel--thus the title--and I, for one, didn't care about his novel and had little or no sympathy for his loss.  There is a murder at the center of the book--but it's resolution is bland and dull.  The novel does allow the reader to keep up with his/her \\" friends\\" at the 87th.  But, all in all, I could have spent my time better--maybe a second Bartholomew Gill would have been better after all.	2003-06-28

I am glad I did.  Unlike the one review to be found here, I found this book to be great fun.  What I find to be the strongest feature of Gill's writing is the way he presents his regular cast of characters. I really care about all of them a great deal. So while the mystery is fun, what really matters is to watch these characters in their interplay with each other and with the possible killers.  The deceased deserved his untimely death and it does not really matter so much how he died.  I was glad to see him gone. But the solving of the mystery and how that solution impacts of Peter McGarr and his co-workers is great fun.  I have come late to the works of Bartholomew Gill and am going through them one at a time.  \\"Death of a Joyce Scholar\\" is the one that I recommend to people the most so far, but \\"Ardent Bibiophile\\" will now be on this list.  If you like Gill, this one will definitely not disappoint.	2003-06-17

I began with &quot;That Night&quot; and have progressed through &quot;At Weddings and Wakes&quot; and into &quot;Charming Billy.&quot;  In each instance it was a joy to watch her writing style mature and blossom--with each book better than the one before.  That string was broken with &quot;Child of My Heart.&quot;  I am glad that all of the neighbors find Theresa to be such an endearing caretaker for their children and household pets.  I found her interesting at the beginning.  But as it became clear that she was to end up being seduced by the 70-year old painter father of one of her charges, I really lost interest.  I had given her more credit--and the author had led me to believe that I should--than to be taken in by this drunken, aspirin-popping seducer of everyone.  Maybe there is something in this novel that I don't get--but I finished it more to get it out of the way and to move on than for any other reason.  I felt disappointment at the end and can only hope that Ms. McDermott will regain her stride soon.	2003-06-09

I started with his next to last book and now know some things about his characters that I would not have found out going in the opposite direction.  But even with that said, I find myself entranced by the characterizations in these two books.  I have become quite comfortable with the repeating case of characters and I enjoy my time with them.  The murder being handled sometimes seems secondary to other issues in their lives.  While I did have some trouble keeping the three potentially villainous women in this novel clear in my mind, it was nevertheless a fun read.  I have always avoided the reading of Joyce's Ullyses, but Gill makes an excellent case for my reconsideration of that decision.  He also brings me back, clearly and strongly, to all my memories of my one trip to Dublin and certainly encourages me to return.  All in all this is a fine story, well-researched and with characters well worth remembering.	2003-04-21

I knew who \\"The Goatman\\" was fairly early in the game, although the identity of the \\"real killer\\" was not clear to me until the end.  The book has its moments--most notably the run and chase ending--but it also has too much of the feel of pulp fiction trying to be something more. The fathrer's quick recovery from drinking and the early insight of a black physician into the work of Kraft-Ebbing is a little too much to believe.  But it does have its moments and it is not to be ignored.	2003-01-09

In all truth, nothing much happens--at least nothing sensational or bizarre.  What does happen, however, is a piece of life so real that you can add it to the \\" meaningless\\" affairs of your own daily life with great ease. McGahern could have easily slipped into Irish stereotype making these characters into  \\"wee people.\\"  But he avoids that flaw and avoids it well.  It was a comfort each morning to read a section or two of this novel--since there are no conventional chapters at all--have my breakfast and go off to work.  My life had already been enriched and yet my official day had not begun.  Read and enjoy.	2002-11-28

And am I ever glad that I approached them in that order.  Amstedam, is only sporadically literate and interesting. Its conclusion most definitely leaves very much to be desired.  It seems, unfortunately, to have been the point of the book but it is hardly justifiable in terms of the character's lives in the book.  It may be technically literate and clever--but it is not very credible. It is almost as if McEwan were struggling with his story to get to that point. <BR>     I also kept waiting for the \\"humor\\" mentioned in the reviews on its cover to reveal itself. It never did.<BR>    I can't help but believe that the best character in the book is dead before the novel begins.  We do attend her funeral and meet her lovers. It is hard to believe that someone as interesting as she is presented to be would have had much to do with the two central characters. Though McEwan is at great pains to assure us that her husband is dull and possessive,the lovers that she is allowed to choose are hardly any better. <BR>     But in the end,I should have known better.  Amstedam did win the Booker Prize, after all, and that is usually a \\"stay away\\" sign for me.  I would suggest not missing Atonement for any reason and to read this one in your spare time if you have a lot of said.	2002-11-11

I had read several of his earlier works and these reviewers stressed how much Atonement was a departure from the earlier materials. That grabbed my attention.  This is a simply wonderful novel that owned me from the opening sequence to its quite incredible conclusion.  These are people whose lives I became wrapped up in, page after page, section after section.  I read it in 30 minute spurts every morning for several weeks and felt as if I were entering the world of early World War ll England and France in a way that I did not believe was possible.  The middle section with the engrossing section on the collapse of France at the beginning of the War is simply stunning.  I then went on to read Amsterdam, the winner of the Booker Prize and the novel written before Atonement.  In a way I am glad that I approached them in that order.  Atonement is, to my mind, the superior book. Amsterdam is literate and very flashy. It moves at a much faster pace than does Atonement.  But to give the Booker prize to it is not much different than giving John Steinbeck the Pulitzer for Winter of Our Discontent.  Read Atonement first and view Amsterdam as a very filling after-dinner mint.	2002-11-10

While it does finally run out of steam near it's conclusion, it is an fine work in and of itself.  But for anyone who wants a sense of the modern Acadian movement it is invaluable.  And if one is an exile of any sort--cultural, political, sexual--this provides amazing insight into what it means to be an exile of any type in the modern world.	2002-08-10

Ever since I have returned, I have absorbed myself in all things Irish.  Sebastian Barry's book is by far the best of the lot--including the much overrated. A Star Call Henry.  This is luminous prose, which tells the full range of modern Irish history more graciously than any book I have read on the subject--so far.

As a first-time European traveler the introductory chapters are  particularly good.  It really is designed for someone who has not a clue  what they are doing. While I found its suggestions for day trips helpful in  making my pre-trip planning, I did find it unhelpful in planning  hotel/B&amp;B accomodations. Because it was slightly dated it,  inadvertantly, helped me get hopelessly lost when looking for Tube  directions to the new &quot;Tate Modern&quot; Gallery.

Unlike some other reviewers I eagerly await Mr. Haruf's next effort and  have enjoyed the process of reading this trilogy a great deal.

I am now on my second read and am  enjoying it every bit as much the second time around. The book is a  collection of ten interrelated essays all dealing with the profound issues  involved in the search for meaning in one's life.

It was with real reluctance that I came to the end of this novel.  Every word of praise that I have read about it  was certainly earned.  Above all else, I cared about each and every one of the characters in this book.  Maybe it  was because I grew up in a town like Holt, albeit in Massachusetts and in  the l950's. But I knew every person in this book.  But what is more  important I came to care about them intensely.  There is a scene of an  outrageous attack on two of the characters in the book which was so real  and so frightening that even though I was in a doctor's waiting room, I  wanted to scream &quot;NO! &quot; as loud as I could.  Rarely have I had  that experience with what passes for contemporary fiction  Maybe this is  an &quot; old-fashioned&quot; novel where nothing much seems to happen.  But if you have ever lived in a small American town, much of what goes on  there seems to be &quot; nothing&quot; until one looks back at it over  time.

But sometimes he requires a great deal more patience than I possess.  Noone presents Vermont with the same sort of clarity that Mayor does.  And he does have a good sense of character.  But  in this novel he goes on at too great a length to get the job done that he  sets out to do.  The final 50 pages seem like 500 and it gets too easy to  confuse characters and locale in the final chase sequence. This is a dark  mystery and not for someone looking for light reading.  In Joe Gunther,  Mayor has created a fine and likeable hero.  But the many subplots  abounding in this one are just too much to take.	1999-09-09

I have put nearly six months into reading it so far and am not the least bit bothered at my pace.   While the book is ostensibly about Mr. Frazier's family, it is safer to  say that it is really about the nature of family, particularly the American  family.  It is also a fascinating history of the country as seen through  the lives of this family.  Mr. Frazier has spent much time in gathering  simply every piece of information that he can possible find about his  family.  There are more names in this book than one can hope to ever  handle.  But the tone, the flavor, and the rhythm of this piece make it an  irresistable read.	1998-11-10
