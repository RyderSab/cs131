With rampant unemployment and inadequete wages for those who are employed. With former KGB in the underworld and secretaries who moonlight as hookers, all is not well in the former \\"Super Power.\\"<br /><br />Professor of History, Dr. \\"Fluke\\" Kelso stumbles onto the story of a lifetime, the preported existence of a Stalin Notebook, a journal of personnal writings from one of the most celebrated sociopaths the world has ever known. A work wrapped in an oilskin binding that could revolutionize the New Russia, and the world. But in the course of his journey Fluke will find out that Stalin left behind a bit more than his personnal thoughts.<br /><br />I'm telling you that this novel is one of the best that I've read in awhile, full of suspense, and history, which warms the heart of this History major, and an almost inside glimpse of what it means to live in Russia in this day and age.	2005-09-01

I was probably just the absence of Jude and the missing descriptive torrid sex that came along with Jude, that failed to draw me in as much. <br />That's not to say that I didn't think Penny Dreadful wasn't an excellent novel, full of surrealism and noir tendencies, fuzzy transitions and other worldly characters who prance about in a stress, drug and sub-conscious induced haze. Numb to the world around them and their plural indentities, in and out of the game.  <br />Phineas Poe our intrepid hero once again has found himself in a dangerous situation in the dregs of society, caught up in a web of drugs, fuzzy logic and dangerous individuals Poe must see through the B.S. which is much easier for him this go around without the morphine addiction and the whole coming to grips with his only having the one kidney.  <br />Poe as a character seemed much more together, and a lot less confused in the 2nd Poe novel, which I greatly liked, he is a very excellently developed figure and I like him better without quite so much fog. Thats not to say that he isn't confused and disoriented several times in this novel, its just a little less.  <br />Check it out, see what you think.	2005-07-21

Well, on the surface its about a group of individuals dooped into joining a writer's retreat which is more than they bargained for. But, in fact is just what they need, in order for them to confront the deomons in their combined pasts. And end up finding their voice in the end and write their masterpieces, with some gruesome details, viscious immoral acts, as well as illegal (and I don't mean when you put the single crushed up sleeping pill in Mom's wine so you could sneek out to sleep with your boyfriend and get knocked up, no I'm talking about the time you accidently killed your mother with a vicodin overdose, so you could sneak out and get pregnant by your boyfriend) and self-depravating characters along the way. Or else it wouldn't be a Palanuik novel without. <br />Deeper, its about reveling in other peoples misery. Hearing those most intimate embarasing details an loving every minute of it. We LOVE FAMINE, WAR, AND SUFFERING. And what's more WE LOVE HEARING ABOUT IT!!! We want to hear those horrible occurences from someone's life Those car crashes at the side of the road that we just can't help ourselves from slowing down and staring at. These stories that people have to say, we just can't stop from listening to. They are the equivalent to the deformed man at the video store, of the little girl wandering the mall with the skin grafts. They all have a story to tell, and we want to hear it.  <br />Not to mention that Palahnuik also breaches the \\"Blame\\" subject. How in out society we constantly seek scapegoats, someone to blame other than ourselves, because it couldn't possibly be OUR FAULT. Its not my fault I'm drunk and ran my car into that church bus full of orphans on their way back from the Cardinal game. Its the bartender's fault. And right now you all agree with me. Right? Then why does it keep happening? <br />At the end of my review I'd just like to leave you with a quote from the book. And Chuck's quotes are the best. Am I right? <br />\\"All those cures and remedies that claim to be 100% natural and therefore are 100% safe. Well, Cyanide is natural, so is arsenic.\\" <br />Thank you and have a great day.	2005-05-19

Hope you know who that is. If you don't check out Fight Club, by Chuck Palahnuik.  OK, Dies The Fire had an original take on the whole apaclyptic novel genre. But that still doesn't mean that it was a great book. At best, and I hate to make cliches, it was OK.  What happens, some inexplicable electrical storm off the East Coast of the US turns nasty and bright blinding light briefly flashes over the world, snuffing the life out of man's modern machinery. Cars stop in their tracks, planes fall out of the sky, and even gunpowder is manipulated on some mplecular level. So, no cars, no guns, what are people to do, well Stirling feels that things will revert back to Fuedalism after a massive die off, people will go back to an Agrarian way of life. Crossbows, swords, shields, bows, and seige weapons come back into play. We find three main groups trying to thrive in their new America.    Why do I feel this way, well one aspect I certainly would have liked to have read more about was Arminger, the Protector and his bunch, always like to read about the bad guy, alot of times they're just more intersting. And Mr. Stirling spent far too little time in telling us about them. Maybe he can address this in the sequel. One real issue I had with the book was all the Wicca, now I don't know much about Wicca, other than it being Earth worship like the Celts, but aside from that I know little else, and am not very interested in it besides that. Not only that alot of what these Wiccans say sounds, oh I don't know, Hokey, Corney? Yeah those would be best words to describe all the crap that comes out of the Mchensies mouths.  So my prognosis is, leave out the Wicca, and spend more time on the bad guys. Hope this helped, thank you.	2005-05-17

He expierences a people, a land and ways of life he could only have read about in his native Argentina. The lands and people of Latin America open their hearts and minds to our two intrepid travelers. Giving them food to fill themselves and a place to lay their weary heads. The exhaustive trip is captured here in these pages. Che was alive to me when I read this I could see his youthfull exhuberence, his mind hungary for experience, memories, tales and change. <br />They must have been two courageous individuals, \\"Che\\" and Alberto to attempt a feat such as this in a place like Latin America in the 1950's where much of the roads were poor, at best. <br />It seems this became a test to Ernesto and Alberto, a test to live off their wits, intuition, luck and inginuity. <br />Its clearly obvious that Ernesto was touched by the poor, disinfranchised and lowly people that he met along his journey. After reading his words, it will be no surprise to you why he turned out the way he did. Its no wonder that this trip was a milestone in the tranformation of one asthmatic Med. student into one of the most charismatic and driven revolutionary leaders of the 20th Century. <br />Thank you	2005-05-09

At first its just a exec. protect mission to keep a Arkansas congressman from getting into too much trouble. Which is a lot more trouble than what you might think, especially if this congressman is a drunk and has a penchant for whores. But true intentions are revealed when once again we meet up with Frenchy Short. Seems the CIA doesn't like a certain smooth talking revolutionary, nor do they like the potential threat he poses to Batista's corrupt regime down Cuba way. Which if he's a threat to Batista then he's a threat to American investments in Cuba, both of the legal and illegal varities.

Phineas Poe, former Internal Affairs Det. with the Denver PD is fresh out of a psychiatric ward after the death of his wife. He wakes up in a hotel room after a night of passion with what he thought was a prostitute, instead of being minus a few hundred bucks, he finds himself minus a kidney, but black in the vendetta department. In a bathtub of ice he calls 911 and the roller coaster begins. Hows that for an opener? Oh, but the originality doesn't stop there, it seems that our man Phineas develops a bit of a crush on the woman who removed his kidney, but its just lust if you ask me. Baer's almost absurd first novel is a great combination of self depravating charecters, depressed existince and cynical pose. Its fuzzy, chaotic transisions take us stumbling through Poe's psyche and timeline of the novel. The series of events in the novel erases the line between percieved reality, hallucination and dream. What is real, what is percieved and what is just a drug induced hallucination. Oh, yeah and what is real. Don't be fooled this is a nitty gritty trip into the seedy underbelly of America, where the slightest lapse in judgement can get you killed or maimed even in the Mile High City.

But Stroyar's two books, this being the sequel have left me with a great sense of hope not only for the world of literature, but also for mankind.  <br />In this the sequel to Children's War we pick up where we left off with our wonderfully developed main character Peter Halifax, though he has had many names in the past. Also in the fray is Peter's wife Zosia, her brother Richard, and his daughter Stefi. Now this latest episode in the saga (Maybe Stroyar Has Another Novel In Her. She Certainly Left The Possibility Open) Peter's trials and tribulations continue, to disolve and undermine the Third Reich in modern times. I don't want to reveal too much about this 2nd book so as to ruin for any of you out there, but let me just say this, Peter's problems are far from over, intrigue and espionage are being played out on both sides. I will however tell you that this book takes a much more political drive to it than Children's did. There is far less action and intrigue in this one.   <br /> <br />Its interesting to note that in an interview I read with Stroyar she noted that her two novels were not actually alternate history, but her instead novels about the Holocaust. But I really don't think so, its more about human rights, and what happens when no one does anything to stop violations of them. Several times it is discussed about why the NAU (North American Union) denounces the human rights violations of Nazi Germany, but still is trading partners and an aid distributor to several other countries with long standing violations themselves. Well what to you know fiction imitates fact on this one. I've often asked myself the same question. Why was it necessary to lie, cheat and steal the American way into a war to take out a one sadistic totalitarian dictator in Iraq, and allow other torturing regimes to go on in existince in Africa and other places throughout the world. And the only thingI can come up with is OIL.	2005-04-18

In the backlash of the sell out, his brefriended leader's son is killed. Fast forward to 10 years later and man is trying to cope with the sell out, he ultimately blames himself for what happened. Now that former befriended Kurdish leader is gunning for someone important, and our \\"Cowboy\\" has to stop him.  <br />There is no telling how popular this book would have been if it had come out during the 1st Gulf War, or in more rescent times with the 2nd Gulf War, when the American people knew about the Kurdish people, instead of the early 1980's.

Lots of action, plenty of guns, and sinful behavior, it is a Hunter book after all. <br />I've got to tell you that eventhough Hunter's books are thrillers, or action adventure or whatever they is a bit of underlying social themes to his novels. And that is the theme of men being men, or attempting to be men, and failing miserably, or just a minor trip up. Now for the most part when I say being men I mean, being good men in the family sense of the word. One other I've noticed is father figures the abundance of them in fact, whether they're good or bad.

Maybe a little more. Although its interesting to note that Nick Memphis has not made an appearence in any of Hunter's other tales. He's about run out of usable time for the two Swagger men. Unless he plans to cover Earl's service years in the Marines. Anyway, back to \\"Point,\\" Hunter's knowledge and research into our sub-culture of guns is astounding. I myself own a few, though I don't get to hunt or shoot as much as I used to, I still consider myself a part of that sub-culture, so I guess what I'm trying to say is, is that I enjoy the gun details, the bullet grains, the droppage, and the assignment of an actual manufactured firearm to a character.  <br />Oh yes, once again someone has double crossed a swagger, but just like his father before him, Bob Lee is nearly uncrossable, eventhough they try not to they always under estimate him, his opponents consider him a country hick, a bumpkin who doesn't know much more than shooting, but alas they get it everytime, the Swagger men are smart as they come as well as deadly as they come.  <br />Read enjoy, live the action and join \\"Bob The Nailer,\\" as he is nearly framed for an assassination then hounded throughout much of the U.S. until he seeks his revenge and begins to the hounding.	2005-04-04

Once there they are given a weapon on their way out. It might be a very useful one like a gun or a grenade, or it could be a rather useless weapon, like a fork or a hand fan. Because of the \\"Battle Royales,\\" no one trusts one another anyway, so one can imagine what happens. Its one of those viscious circle kind of things.  <br />An action packed novel full of social comentary, involving generational gaps in society. Though it moves a bit too fast in the beginning to allow any kind of character following, but that all changes once the ranks get thinned a bit. A novel about the generation gap, don't understand your children? Then allow your gov't. to stick them on an island to kill one another. And while your at it instill a national trait of paranoia and dis-trust of everyone, making it near impossible to form a revolution. Limit their freedom of thought.

There he stays until the man, his father, who is the man intrusted with Szell's vast wealth of diamonds dies. So Szell needs those diamonds to live. Doc, our hero's big bro. is a spy, but apparently spies need some extra cash now and then so he worked as a courier for delivering the diamonds to wherever they needed to go.   The White Angel thinks Babe (the main character) knows whether or not its safe to get the diamonds, torture of Babe insues. The old Nazi is a dentist so you can imagine how he tortures.     Though I wasn't too impressed with the story itself, already having seen the movie, and they are pretty much just alike, Goldman's prose on the other hand was outstanding, a fast paced well written little book. His dialogue was to die for, quick and witty, giving the characters a 1930's noir aura.    Really if just want to skip the novel and watch the book, feel free. Or if you have seen the movie and want experience the book, you really don't need to. They are nearly identical. Which makes since of course because Goldman wrote the sceenplay, so you'd think he'd stay true to his own work.	2005-03-02

In this alternate reality the Cuban Misssle Crisis escalated past demands and threats and into a full out nuclear war, leaving the Soviet Union utterly decimated and the USA better off, but only slightly so. Our hero is a former Green Beret turned reporter, and our heroine is a reporter for the London Times turned MI6 spy. So 1962 was the year for the nuclear war, Vietnam never escalates into a war, protestors never have a chance to start in with that, but the draft is still in effect and thousands of soldiers are drafted and sent to zones infected with radiation. So protestors still take on the draft. The people of the United States still learn to distrust their gov't. during this tumoltuous time period just as it happened in our own reality. Our country still looses its innocence during the same time period as it happened in our own. Though I read a lot of alternate history, this one got me to thinking about alternate realities in a much more philosophical way. Sure there may very well be other realities out there where the Nazis won WWII, or the South won the Civil War, or where oranges evolved into the dominate species, or they may be just as boring as your desk sits 2 inches over to the right from where it currently is. But with all that out of the way, this book was very believable, I could see everything invisioned in the pages of this novel, and could have lived there myself, it seemed that well thought out and imagined.  <br />-SPOILER WARNING- Do Not Read Past This Point <br />One thing that I liked and disliked at the same time was the charactor of General \\"The Rammer\\" Curtis, notice the similarities between this man and the charactor of General \\"Hooker\\" from Dr. Strangelove. Both are cigar chomping men who are looking to start a nuclear war. <br />What bothered me about this? Well mainly its that I'd have thought DuBois could have developed something on his own, rather than such an obvious copy of a classic movie character. And I liked it, because I recognized the homage paid to Stanley Kubrick.	2005-02-28

No one but themselves know they exist, and of course they're fingers reach into everything. But the worst one of the bunch just so happens to be our lead character's brother. His twin brother. More scary and disturbing than any horror book (though not really a horror novel) I ever read, and why? Because it deals with a tangible issue, and one that was happened in the past and occurs everyday, though maybe not so organized. This group will make the Nazis seem like pansey's.

The dialogue was good, and did not stumble (I felt), granted it wasn't a pullizer, but it wasn't trash either. And yes it was Alt. History I don't know how it could have been anything but. Course the develpment of WWI technology in last decade of the 19th cent. Machine guns, yeah, but airplanes, in 1894, that are 10 years more advanced than what the Wright Bro. flew in 1902, eventhough they had divine intervention. So military tech. progressed a little too quickly in this book. The most interesting aspect of this novel was the war dogs.

It was interesting however, as Hyde's historical thrillers are, the conspiratorial pose set amongst real historical figures and events lends these books a great tangible feel.

I picked this one up after reading Hot Springs, and just let me say that probably one of the big reasons I bought it was because it is set during the Spansih Civil War, which is one of my favorite conflicts in History, as well as I just love Spanish history and culture, having traveled there once.   Anyway, I liked the conflict the two main characters, an old friendship rekindled with doubts included. With Soviets and Nazis, Facists & Royalists, thrown into the atmosphere & history of the Spanish Civil War for good measure. Pick up Spainish Gambit or Tapestry of Spies they're the same book, you'll enjoy it.	2005-02-11

I started with 2nd Assassin, loved it, then it was Gathering of Saints, love it, then Wisdom of the Bones, and I loved it, but this early work by Hyde just didn't cut the mustard with me. I found it slow, and awkward, and it felt as though it was written by a novice. I didn't finish, barely got half way, which is pretty rare for me. I've got to really dislike a book to not finish. If I had read this book 1st I wouldn't have read any of his work since this one. Glad I didn't start here.	2005-02-11

So here it goes. In the distant future mankind has managed to destroy its earthly civilization. On Earth man has regressed to roving bands of hunter gatherers once again, one lone man becomes head of his tribe, just in time to have the messengers of heaven come down and steal women from his tribe. He manages to stowaway on their ship and is taken into space to a space station in Earth's orbit, where he finds that before the war the upper crust of society shuttled themselves into several space stations, and eventually each nation's station were connected to create one large station. Now the women of these stations have become baren and cannot produce children hence the stealing of the \\"primitive\\" women from Earth. Our hero is taken in and educated by the tech. class aboard, and this action proves to turn the station upside down as he becomes self aware and angery at the ruling class aboard. Don't want to reveal too much just thought this might help someone make a decision concerning this book. Thank you.	2005-02-10

The one issue I had with the book causes a conflict within myself, because it is also the praise that I give the author, that being, the fact that at times I just wished Roth would pick a direction coming of age or alt. history. Which for me made this a slow read. The tale that Roth comes with certainly seems plausible and sights this in the reading, that of Lindbergh becoming president, he certainly held sway over the American people, he was an isolationist, a great adventurer, and he also had the sympathies of the public due to his murdered son. I however didn't see Nazis kidnapping the child and blackmailing Lindbergh into running for president and implementing their policies toward the Jews, course this isn't really a big concern of mine, it is after all alt. history, certain liberties must be taken.	2005-02-09
US	40285720	R3D2324TZR6LKX	0060521562	26282771	Ice Hunt	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Average Thriller	Nothing spectacular in this book, kind of between a Michael Crichton book and a Mathew Reilly book, science meets adventure. Not as good as Crichton,, but not as outlandish as a Reilly. A Russian Ice Station dating to the 1930's is discovered by a research US Navy Sub, insuing chaos begins, and there is a possible world threatening catastrophe as the ultimate outcome unless the heros stop the MADNESS. Oh, sorry I forgot about the undiscovered man eating creatures called Grendels. Combined with Delta Force commandos and Russian Leopard Corps there's plenty of action at the top of the world. But little else, if you like sensless action, pseudo science, and chaotic sequence of events, then by all means pick it up.	2005-02-03

Now I'm not one of those people that can read any kind of alternate history and enjoy it, I just can't. The writing has to be good, and frankly I just didn't think Turtledove did a very good job on this one. I finished because just when I was about to give up, it picked up and became interesting, leaving the first 200 pages behind in a hurry.	2005-02-02
US	40285720	R7AUPJWCTLAL3	1573226521	117734468	The Beach	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Beach Culture Never Looked So Good, And Unappealing	I loved this book at first it starts out and I think OK its a bunch of rich shallow kids who are looking for some Nihilistic experience. But then they move on and find the Beach, and its culture, Richard and his 2 French companions find that Nihilistic experience there. Only in the beginning I think Richard was a little disapointed when no one sat around all day and talked about it. \\"Its just a beach resort.\\" Sal told him. But in the beginning it was so much more, Richard is mesmerized by action of fitting in, in this utopian experience. At first he sees no petty differences, just everyone living \\"the Life,\\" fishing, gardening, cooking, talking. There's no television, no radio, no newspapers, and no phone. So they only have each other for company and contact. There are some symbols of the outside world, only really two to be precise, the GameBoy, and the boat. Entertainment and transportation. Two of the bigger catalysts from the modern world. But then things sour, events don't just begin to sour, there were rifts previously there already, but they are made worse by some events that cause these rifts to broaden and engulf the commune. And it becomes evident that these people are in fact spoiled brats of rich parents and think only of themselves and how things will effect them and their time at the beach. They become completly irrational, they do not help people who are in life threatening danger, and allow them to be killed, they do not notify family members that their loved ones have died. In fact when some people are killed by other forces they in fact see this as a blessing, a particular problem that was bothering them has been taken care of, and the commune did not have to confront the issue. This bit was almost completly frustrating for me. I hated the people in the book for this. Read the book, enjoyed it very much, be sure to catch all the Vietnam references, one screwed event compared to another. One reference in particular is the Tet Celebration which signifies a change in the commune's way of life as did the Tet Offensive in Vietnam. <br />	2005-01-28
US	40285720	RENL4AE9U23B4	0671027387	315416156	Deception Point	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Disapointing Read	I loved Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, so I thought I'd try one of Brown's earlier works. I was sorely disapoointed, as you can tell from my title. It lacked the flash and panache of his works already mentioned. Too much invention, rifles that fire ice and sand bullets, ships capable of near impossible speeds, and of course \\"black\\" helicopters firing missles at the FDR Memorial? Uh uh, I didn't buy it, but I did finish it, mostly because it was a fast read, and I didn't feel like I was devoting too much time to a mediocre book. Not that they can all be great, maybe I should have started at the beginning and worked my up, might have been pleasently surprised.	2005-01-26

Excellent for a plane ride, or train	If your looking for something lite to read, something without hidden meaning, to take you to the exotic local of Cairo, Egypt, then this is the book for that. The action was minimal, but enough to keep me interested, conflict between love, duty, and friendship plays a role in the 3 main charactors. Nothing stellar about the book, it was just OK. Lacked the drama and conspiritorial shine and polish of Christopher Hyde's WWII thrillers.	2005-01-25

Garland however failed to pull it off. I wasn't too terribly interesting, other than the book store scene, and the childhood home scene. Read it in an hour, won't read it again, thinking about selling it to the used book store, but it looks cool on my shelf. Oh and it does have a cool look with nice interesting art work.	2005-01-25

But anyway a serial killer, kills and leaves the his victoms lifeless bodies in areas selected for German bombing raids in London, during the Battle of Britain. So how does the killer know? Guess you'll have to read to find out. Also plays on why Germany quit bombing London. Good book, Hyde as usual, does a stupendous effort with the research, and development of the characters. Scotland Yard MI6, and a well placed German agent help to make this book one hell of a read. <br />If you liked this one try Black Cross, by Greg Iles, and Archangel, by Robert Harris.	2005-01-24

Hmm, well it started out slow and then quickly regressed into a retarded nightmare full of odd characters and weird situations. Course what could be weirder than a zombie book? A dumb one? Maybe I'm expecting too much. The zombies, oh I'm sorry Xombies turn blue and its spread by women, unless they aren't getting their monthlies. The ending was hard to understand and didn't make much since and what I mean by that is, is it was pretty disjointed and seemed as though the author wanted to think up some surprise ending that would maybe shock the reader and leave us dismayed, but it really didn't. It was more of a dispointing ending. Hard to understand, didn't enjoy, trying to be too fresh, while just ended up being a bad deal all around. <br />I've only read one other zombie book other than this, and it wasn't any better, so maybe I'll just stick to the movies. Shaun of the Dead is good, go check that out.	2005-01-20

Well I hadn't either, but that's OK cause Jack Long thought of it for us. One very interesting read, if your into the Chricton science meets adventure genre. I've read plenty of those, but this book stands out. Its an exceptional read full of humanity and depravity. Its a lot like a frontier story, with man coming in pushing the savages back out of their territory using his superior technology and quest for adventure and riches as his catalyst and justification for ruining yet another another part of our planet. After all he's just taming Hell.  <br />Maybe we're not alone. Just instead of looking up we should be looking down. And maybe we should be a little more respectable. Because you just never know who's watching.	2005-01-14

Well walk across half of Asia, through China and Siberia, once you get to the Pacific catch a ride an then where? Well from there its a short jaunt down to Los Alamos. Whew! This was one of the better books that I've read in awhile. Kept me in suspence the whole time, very rare that book does that. Couldn't put down. Maybe not as good as Long's other book Descent, but still Year Zero is an excellent book. The main character is well driven, so well that I could see myself walking those distances and taking those risks right along with him to save my daughter or at least see her one last time. Good read, you'll probably get lost, but don't worry that's a good thing.	2005-01-14

I will read this book again, and again. Best of Christopher Hyde's body of work. Highly recommend that you order a copy today.  <br />The historical facts blended with fictional finesse blended the facts and fiction along near invisible lines, left me seeing conspiracies everywhere. I think he must have taken some initiative from Oliver Stone's JFK. <br />	2005-01-14

Deeply moving, involved is not an appropriate word, but its all that I can think of, maybe involved times 10. Simply a wonderful book. Its been a long time since I cared about a character in a novel and I deeply cared for Peter he became a part of my life for the better part of a month. I was lent the book by a friend along with The Plot Against America, and In the Presence of Mine Enemies, needless to say I was not overly impressed with either of those, I have read Alt. History but pick and choose what I read. 1901, and Fatherland have been about the best I've read up till Children's War. I was a bit intimidated upon first being lent the book, but once I started I loved it. I would recommend picking up this book, though the paperback might be a better choice the hardback can become a little uncomfortable at times, and reading it becomes a physical task as well as mental.	2005-01-14

Its been tough though finding a book in the same sub-genre that meets the enjoyment I got from this book. This book and a segment of Unsolved Mysteries has convinced me that there was something fishy going on with the whole Hess mess. But anyway, this book has made onto the keep shelf of my book case, because I have already re-read it and plan on doing so many times in the future. Though I need to get a new copy, lent it out too much, and its now falling apart. Hope you take my advice and pick one up for youself.	2005-01-14

I didn't go into it thinking \\"Oh look another Pulitzer Winner.\\"  I went into thinking that I like Crichton books, I'll like this one the summary seemed to support my theory. But alas, was I ever friggin wrong. Really we only needed about half of this book, the rest was just a rant gone bad.  <br />Really only one scene where the hero miracously stops the exploding bomb or doomsday device 5 seconds before it detonates is needed, defintely just the once, not twice.  And come on could there have been enough villians in this book, Nazis, Militia groups, rogue Army officers, ex-girlfriends who become whoring sister in-laws, giant jungle cats, and man eating caimans. Furthermore there was way too many tremendous feats achieved by a language prof. Yeah, yeah, yeah you can tell me the whole line about the courage of the everyday man, but come on. Oh and I don't know, but I guess that Mr. Reilly must have forgot that he had one of the pontoons on the seaplane shot off. But the charactors continue to fly and land the thing throughout the rest of the book. I thought that it'd be kind of hard to land a seaplane with just one pontoon WITHOUT IT CRASHING!!!  <br />I will say this, the initial idea for the story was good, but not much else. In fact I think this book sucked. The only reason I gave it a star was because I finished it. Why I don't know, but I did, guess I just figured I had too much time invested to just give up.	2004-08-26

The dialogue felt forced, and the writing was amateurish at best. It was entertaining for about the first 1/3 of the book, and quickly lost intrest, I did finish, and was most disapointed with the ending, it was just plain wrong. Now I understand the use of a cliffhanger, but there was no need for a cliffhanger and I don't want to hear that crap about how its the job of the reader to decide what happened. In the smart movies of Romero they all end with a hanger, but in those we are given a choice, in this one we aren't even given that.  It just ends with a scream. It is my opinion that this author painted himself into a corner and just had to end it.	2004-08-25

I just thought the book wasn't concieved near as much as the movie was, it seemed that Tim Burton put more fore-thought in the movie than Mr. Wallace did in his book. Now I did like the conflict between father and son and how this is resolved in the father's own special way, but besides that I didn't care much for the book. Now I loved the movie on the other hand, and thought it was excellent, best movie I'd seen in a while.	2004-03-01

I am now 24 and reread this book every 2 yrs. or so and it gets better every time. I have read it so many times and lent my original copy out to be read to nearly everyone I know that it has fallen apart and I recently bought another copy from amazon so that I may reread it again for the sixth time. I can't really say why I fell in love with it, but it's probably all the corelations with Sherlock Holmes and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and not to mention the all incapcitating web Frost weaves that makes it continue to bring me back time after time. I also read the sequel The 6 Messiahs, however enjoying reading it also, I wasn't as entralled with it as I was with the first.	2002-03-19
