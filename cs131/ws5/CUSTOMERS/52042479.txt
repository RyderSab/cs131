The book centers around a cowboy from Wyoming, Tully Mars, who has fled to Caribbean to an escape a warrant for his arrest that was filed by his crazed employer Thelma Barston.  The book follows Tully through several stops as a fishing guide, a mate on a large schooner, involved in a wild party and near capture in Belize and as the rebuilder of an old lighthouse which is the centerpiece of the story.  The book is really a collection of vignettes that are told by Tully or through letters written to Tully by a country singer/adventure pilot Willie Singer who is Tully's idol.  The book bounces around between telling Tully's story and that of his benefactor, the 101-year old captain of the schooner, Cleopatra Hightower.  The stories are loosely connected together with a nice out of left-field ending.  If you are looking for a fast, easy-paced read than you can't go wrong with this book.  It is like the best of Mr. Buffett's music, bright, sunny and full of good cheer.	2005-09-22

Writer H.G. Bissinger moved his family from Philadelphia to Odessa to immerse himself in the culture that is Texas High School Football.  The book tells not only of the incredible fanatism of the town towards the football team, but the origins of Odessa and its racial divide.  Amazingly, the town had segregated schools until 1982 and the racial intolerance of many whites towards most of the black players on the team and in the town in general is startling.  But it is Mr. Bissinger's writings about several of the team's players that is the most interesting aspect of the book.  The players all realize the importance placed on the team and they deal with the pressure in different ways. Some are aloof and inward, some revel in the special treatment they receive, others drink too excess and others soak in every last minute knowing that their life will not get any better than it is as a Permian player.  Whether you are a football fan or not, Friday Night Lights is compelling and highly enlightening and entertaining.	2005-09-15

While you know the outcome that Bannister is the first to accomplish the feat, Mr. Bascomb effectively keeps you in suspense following all three runners in the near misses.  His description of the races puts you right in the middle of the runners as if you were actually involved.  He also chronicles the changing face of sports in the mid 20th century where Bannister is the last of the truly amateur athletes, competing in sports and also living a full-rounded life (he studied and passed his medical exam all in the midst of training and breaking the barrier) and Santee represents the changing of the guard, athlete as entertainer.	2005-08-26

The concept of the book is excellent.  Connecting various stories of the 1975 season in a cut and paste manner makes for a more interesting read than just a straight chronological account.  Mr. Adelman is also very adept at painting a descriptive picture of the events he is relaying.  The frustrating part is that he is very inaccurate with his facts and one never knows if everything is real.  The story about how Barry Bonds started choking up on the bat during bat day at Shea Stadium just seems too far fetched to believe.  This other similar stories of young Ken Griffrey, Jr., Mark McGwire & Rickey Henderson lead you to question how accurate or real the stories of the actual '75 are.	2005-08-26

The book takes a look at the life of Broadway Joe from his days in the Lower End of Beaver Falls, PA to his greatest heights as the quarterback of the New York Jets.  Mr. Kriegel describes how a generation of boys grew up idolizing Mr. Namath and he is clearly one of them.  But Mr. Kriegel does a great job of walking that precarious line between being a fan and a reporter.  The book provides you with all the highs and lows from Mr. Namath's life.  From his dealings with purported mobsters to his problems with alcohol to his saving the AFL and forcing the AFL-NFL merger to his greatest triumph of winning Super Bowl III, Mr. Kriegel offers up it all up with sharp writing style.

His .406 batting average stands as of the game's greatest accomplishments and is still the benchmark average that modern players aim towards.  Leigh Montvale's Ted Williams: The Biography Of An American Hero is the most extensive book about the Splendid Splinter.  Despite the fanfare, the book is a disappointment.  Mr. Montvale spends far too much time on Mr. Williams' life after baseball than his time within the game.  To any reader of any sports biography, the most important aspect of the book should be the subject's athletic career.  No one wants to read just an expanded stat sheet, but Mr. Montvale concentrates too much of the book on Mr. Williams' life outside of baseball.  The 1941 season has some detail, but the 1946 is almost written as an afterthought.  That season ended in Mr. Williams' only trip to the World Series in his long career.  His two Triple Crown seasons of 1942 &amp; 1947 are mentioned in passing.  Mr. Montvale does do an excellent job of explained the bitter rivalry between Mr. Williams and the Boston sportswriters.  But again, he spends too much time into the background of the writers (one doesn't really care about the life history of Mr. Williams' fiercest critic, Dave Egan, but we get that).  Mr. Montvale does go into great detail about Mr. Williams' three marriages and his fishing life on the Florida Keys and Canada.  This is interesting, to a point, but these aspects of his life should have been given the secondary nature that his career received.  Mr. Montvale also conveys Mr. Williams as an impetuous, foul-mouthed crank and relays countless stories from acquaintances and loved ones who hammer this point home.  Included is a word for word interview with Mr. Williams' third wife Dolores that was conducted in 1969 but never released that makes this point abundantly clear.  Mr. Montvale ends the book with a sort of biography within a biography as he details the life and exploits of Mr. Williams' only son, John Henry.  Again, this is interesting and shows how sad of an end that Mr. Williams' life had, but he goes overboard in his tales of John Henry's transgressions.  This book is not without merit as it does provide some detailed insights into one of the 20th Century's greatest athletes, but it falls short of its potential greatness.oits of Mr. Williams' only son, John Henry.

It goes into the story about an underground society, the Priory of Scion, whose sole purpose is to keep the true meaning of the Holy Grail secret until it is time to reveal it to the world.  The story unfolds over basically one night in Paris.  Robert Langdon is a Harvard professor of symbology and is in Paris giving a lecture.  He is awoke in his hotel room and escorted to the Louvre as a well-known art curator, Jacques Sauriene has been murdered.  While at the Louvre he is met by Captain Bezu Fache who interrogates him and a cryptologist Sophie Nouveu who gives him a bizarre message.  It turns out that Langdon is the prime suspect in the murder and Sophie helps him escape.  It turns out she is Sauriene's granddaughter.  Throughout the night they elude the French police and go to an old acquaintance of Langdon, Leigh Teabing, for refuge.  Teabing is an excentrict Englishman living in France who is also one of the world foremost expert on the Grail.  Meanwhile, a strict religious sect, Opus Dei, is also in search of the Grail as well.  Eventually Langdon and Sophie put together all the pieces of the puzzle and Sophie's true identity is revealed to her.  The most interesting part of the book is the history of the Grail itself.  Whether you believe the story or not (most of it has been refuted and is hard to believe to be actually true), the story is very intriguing.  Explaining clues from Da Vinci paintings and the history of the Gospels makes for great reading.  Unfortunately, the story in between the lessons is weak.  Mr. Brown creates some very implausible situations and the true motives of Teabing are totally unbelievable and contrived. The plot and elaborate setup that Teabing constructs has absolutely no plausibility and could never be carried out, even by the most devious and creative minds.  That lacks of believability definitely hurts the story, but all the Grail information makes up for the huge plot holes.s up for the huge plot holes.	2004-07-01

The story centers around a game on December 9, 1977 between the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets at the Great Western Forum in LA. At the time, the NBA was not the institution it is today.  Drug use was rampant, fighting was commonplace and the league was really an afterthought to most fans.  In fact, the NBA finals were not even broadcast live on TV.  So, the game between the Lakers and Rockets was just an average early season contest between two mediocre teams.  The incident started when Laker center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Rocket center Kurt Kunnert got tangled up at center court.  Being that Abdul-Jabbar had hurt himself in a fight earlier in the week, Laker forward Kermit Washington got involved to protect Abdul-Jabbar.  Rockets forward Rudy Tomjanovich, who was at the other end of the court, saw the melee and ran down to try and break it up.  As Tomjanovich was running at full speed, Washington felt his presence, turned and delivered a crushing blow to Tomjanovich's face.  The force was so severe that it basically broke Tomjanovich's face.  Tomjanovich was rushed to the hospital, where it was discovered he was leaking brain fluid and actually if not for the good sense of the Laker trainer to call a head trauma specialist, he may have died.  The book is at its best when it details how due to this one brief instance, the lives of two men were irrevocably changed.  Tomjanovich's career got back on track, he returned the next year and was a starter on the Western Conference All-Star team, and he eventually became coach of the Rockets and won two NBA titles in the 1994 & 1995.  But the physical and emotional trauma that he was left with still haunt him.  He could never seem to accept accolades as he felt they were bestowed on his out of pity.  He also became an alcoholic.  Kermit Washington fared far worse.  His career never was the same.  He was suspended for an indefinite period of time and his career became defined by the punch.  Even though he was an enforcer and tough guy on the court, off the court he overcame many odds to succeed in life.  He was from a tough neighborhood in Washington, DC, but went to American University and not only was a star basketball player, but an Academic All-American and class valedictorian.  But since the punch, he was virtually been blackballed from getting a job in the NBA.  Mr. Feinstein does a great job of detailing the lives of the two men and how their colors, Tomjanovich is white and Washington is black, helped play a role in how the incident was received.  What The Punch fails to do though is to explain how this incident really changed basketball.  Outside of adding a third referee and scaling back on the fighting, Mr. Feinstein glosses over that aspect.  Basketball was changed and elevated to the level it is today basically due to Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird.  The Lakers and Celtics rivalry in the 80's and Jordan's pure athletic excellence propelled the sport and helped to overcome any stigmatism left from the 70's.  Mr. Feinstein does a good job of getting into the effects on the two players, but he takes what is essentially an ugly footnote in league history and tries to make into a pivotal, league defining and altering event.same.

But much of those books like Tom Brokaw's Greatest Generation series and the late Stephen Ambrose's books focused on the average foot soldier's experiences.  Presidential historian Michael Beschloss' The Conquerors looks at the men at the highest ranking of power, most notably Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Mr. Beschloss is an obvious devotee to FDR and he considers him the most important world leader of the 20th century, but the book is even-handed in its assessment of FDR's handling of the war and post war Germany.  Most notable is FDR's take on the Holocaust and his Treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau's efforts to convince FDR to take a more active role in stopping the concentration camps.  The fact that FDR was reflecting the views of day toward Judaism is not an excuse in Mr. Beschloss' mind for his passive attitude towards dealing with that most harrowing of situations.  Though much of the subject matter has been recounted in far too many other books to note, Mr. Beschloss' writing style is more entertaining than most.  While he deals with high-minded subject matter, he presents it in an intelligent, yet ease to digest manner.	2002-11-04

He sets out to travel to globe hitting points everywhere from San Francisco to Moscow to Cambodia to Mexico to France to Scotland to his hometown of New York City.  No food is too scary or repulsive to try and no alcoholic beverage is ever denied.  Along his journey, Mr. Bourdain eats food as varied as haggis, sushi, cobra's heart, iguana, stinky cheeses, oysters, doughnuts, hot dogs and sheep testicles.  In Kitchen Confidential, Mr. Bourdain ridicules celebrity chefs that appear on the Food Network, but he gives into the television business as the entire is being filmed by the network for a series.

Mr. Cobain's life was marred by trouble and tragedy, but nothing affected it as much as the divorce of his parents.  Throughout the rest of his life, he was constantly haunted by the divorce.  His life was an enigma.  He made up stories of how rotten his father was, yet, even near the of his life, wanted his love and approval.  He seemed to be the ultimate anti-hero, in which he wanted no part of fame.  But he was incredibly driven to succeed in the music industry and once Nirvana hit it big, was known to complain to his managers that they weren't getting enough promotion or airtime on MTV.

The team is one of most beloved of all time in New York sports and was made up of several NBA legends.  Mr. Berger was a beat writer and his inside story on this magical team is an immensely enjoyable read.  The players on the team seem almost like characters created for a novel.  The smooth and stylish Walt &quot;Clyde&quot; Frazier, the leader Willis Reed, the studious Bill Bradley (who would go one to be a US Senator and run for President), the scrappy, iron tough Dave DeBusschere, the understated but invaluable Dave Barnett and the supporting players all have interesting personalities on and off the court.  The late, great Red Holzman coached this team to greatness.  The book is even more interesting to read now, some thirty years later, as it serves as a history lesson in what the NBA used to be like.

Mr. Clayton-Lea offers an extremely pedestrian account of the life and times of Elvis Costello.  The book reads like press clippings in many spots and offers no insight into the man's career.  Being that there are barely any books on Mr. Costello, this book has a minimum of value for that reason, but not much else. if you are an avid fan of Mr. Costello, then this book doesn't offer much, but if you are not that familiar with his career, then this book is a decent primer.	2002-01-22

The book is a hefty tome that examines all of Sir Elton's songs in illuminating detail as well as other aspects of his career.  The book is reverently but not fanatically so and Ms. Rosenthal heaps praise and dishes criticism where necessary and in general has written the best book on Elton John's career.  If you are a fan of Elton John, then this book is an absolute must read.  Even if you are not a big fan, this book is well written and worth examining.	2002-01-22

The story reads almost as a novel and Mr. Bowden's writing style is detailed and incisive.  He doesn't inject his own political views into the story and doesn't provide conjecture on why the events happened and what could have been done to avoid them.  He just tells the servicemen's story and recounts the unbelievable situation that they found themselves in.  The mission seemed routine at the inception, but the men weren't prepared for the amount of artillery that the average Somailian carries on a daily basis.  Mr. Bowden makes you feel as if you are placed right into the firestorm and you get a real sense of the horrifying conditions. Black Hawk Down is a first rate book and worthy of all the accolades that have been bestowed upon it.	2002-01-21

Thompson became a self-described political junkie from his days on the 1972 Presidential campaign trail.  Unabashedly throwing his support behind Democratic candidate George McGovern, Dr. Thompson takes on a dizzying journey from hotel room to hotel room across the country lauding his man McGovern and railing against his enemy Richard Nixon.  The book provides as much detail about Mr. Thompson's activities as they do the campaigns themselves, but hell, Dr. Thompson is alot more interesting.  One of the most poignant moments is when Dr. Thompson rides in a limo with his enemy Nixon and they discuss football, which is a passion of both men.  Dr. Thompson actually sees some humanity in Nixon and breaks down the facade that Nixon and most politicians erect.  He shows a human side to a man who is often looked upon as inhuman.  Dr. Thompson still despises him and his views, but by peeling away a layer, he can expose things that lay beneath the surface.  For people like myself who were too young to experience this campaign and the times, Fear &amp; Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72 is a brilliant and amazing ride through the times.	2001-12-27

Obviously due to the dimensions of the book, each album is not reviewed in great detail. The reviews are decent, nothing spectacular.  The one plus the book has is that while there are numerous collections like this for rock or combine all genres, there are very few that concentrate only on soul music.  The biggest negative I have is that they include greatest hits collections.  Most all of the Motown groups like The Four Tops, The Temptations and The Supremes are represented by greatest hits collections.  While they are more noted for their singles work, they and many other Motown groups made some outstanding albums in the 60's prior to the groundbreaking album work of Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye in the 70's.	2001-12-27

But the magazine hit its stride and became cultural significant in the 70's.  This book is a great review of the decade detailing everything from Nixon to Springsteen to disco to All in The Family to the emergence of porn and casual sex.  Writers from Rolling Stone like Hunter S. Thompson detailing how gonzo journalism was conceived (and in his words, never truly achieved), founder and editor Jann Wenner on the man behind the infamous Pentagon Papers and others are excellent, but it is the contributions for others not necessarily associated with the magazine that hit the mark.  The Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde was a student at Kent State and gives a first person of what happened when the National Guardsmen killed four students.  Tom Wolfe expouses on radical chic and the stories about the emergence of Soul Train, the deaths at a Who concert in Cincinnati, the Saturday Night Fever and disco explosion, Bruce Springsteen and Al Trautwig's essay on Julius &quot;Dr. J' Erving are all superb.  The book's left-hand margin contains a running timeline that note important and relevant events of the decade in chronological order.  This book is an immensely satisfying, enjoyable and informative read.	2001-12-27

Most of Dr. Thompson's writings are in the first person and personally revealing, so the fact we get to read his personal correspondence isn't as revealing as it maybe for other journalists.  That being said, these letters are full of the insightful commentary that Dr. Thompson is noted for.  He can skewer people with the best of them, but amongst his rants lay a sharp sense of humor.

The Decades of Rock &amp; Roll continues their winning ways.  The book is coffee table sized, but not as bulky and is loaded with some great pictures.  But the real meat of the book are the essays by the likes of Robert Palmer, Chet Flippo, David Fricke, Kinky Friedman, Jim Farber and Kinky Friedman.  Each decade from the 50's to the 90's is well represented as artists as diverse as Ruth Brown, Madonna, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Public Enemy are examined. Sprinkled throughout the book are artists like Robbie Robertson, Steven Tyler, John Fogerty, Suzanne Vega, Ozzy Osbourne and others top ten lists of albums and songs from a particular era, group or genre.

His book on the 90's is not quite up to that level, but is still an invaluable information source.  Unlike his book on the 70's, Mr. Christgau does not provide a written review of every album that an artist released.  Only the albums that he actually reviewed in the Village Voice appear in the longer review form.  He also doesn't give letter grades to all releases, but gives varying degrees of stars to honorable mention releases, bombs and turkeys to some losers, a ham for choice cuts (singles) and even gives a grade of neither for releases that do not elicit a favorable or unfavorable reaction.  Mr. Christgau's introduction to the book details his reviewing process and it is quite revealing.	2001-12-27

This book culls together his reviews of albums that were released in the 1970's.  Mr. Christgau is bluntly honest in his reviews and isn't beyond ridicule in some of his reviews.  His reviews are short and concise and very usual on the mark.  What makes this book better than most review books is that he applies a letter grade to each album.  This avoids the confusion of the star system that most review books employ.  If you are a big fan of 70's music, then this book is essential for your collection.  Even if you aren't a fan of this era, Mr. Christgau's writing style makes for entertaining reading.	2001-12-27

He lists what he considers the 1001 greatest singles of all-time with Marvin Gaye's &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot; topping the list. The songs tend to skew towards music of the 50 &amp; 60's (the book was originally published in the late 80's, so that's why nothing from the 90's appears), but that's Mr. Marsh's era.  I don't agree with alot of his rankings (Van Halen's &quot;Jump&quot; ranks ahead of anything by The Beatles who probably are the greatest singles band of all-time is a major blunder), but that's the exact point of the book.  We all have our opinions on what is great and Mr. Marsh is simply expressing his.	2001-11-05

The album is a decent effort, but doesn't match up to his quintessential early 70's albums.  One big reason is that he severed his writing partnership with Bernie Taupin.  Together they created unforgettable songs, but apart, they've been hit and miss.  A Single Man falls into the hit and miss category.  Songs like &quot;Shine On Through&quot;, &quot;Ego&quot;, &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot; and the gorgeous and heartfelt &quot;Song For Guy&quot; (a tribute to his young messenger who was killed in a motorcycle accident) are quite good while others like &quot;Big Dipper&quot;, &quot;Georgia&quot;, &quot;Madness&quot; &amp; &quot;Reverie&quot; fall short of the mark	2001-07-12

Swimming in the ocean was a relative new thing at that time as people on the East Coast were starting to take advantage of new found leisure time and easier access to the Shore thanks to the railroad system.  It was a badge of honor amongst men to see how far they could swim in the ocean.  With no fear of the known undertows of the waters off the Jersey Coast or the creatures that live in it, men swam with a wanton disregard of danger.  The first known attack on a swimmer by a shark was a young Philadelphian of means, Charles Vansant.  Despite the reports that it was a shark, the experts of the day declared that it was not a shark as there were no documented reports that sharks ever attacked humans and that it was probably a killer whale or swordfish.  People were not deterred from going into the water after the attack, but after a couple more attacks, a reign of terror began to grip the Jersey Shore communities.  Mr. Capuzzo alternatively takes us through the lives of the victims and the shark's.  It is the detailing of the great white that is extremely interesting and insightful.  Mr. Capuzzo is able to reconstruct the shark's movements and thought in chilling detail.  The cavalier attitude of people towards the water and their lack of knowledge about sharks in general is stunning considering these events occurred less than 90 years ago.  Much like the book and movie it inspired, Jaws, Close To Shore will make you think twice about going in the water.	2001-06-26

Schulman's takes a look at how the Seventies shaped the political structure of today.  The book actually stretches from 1968 to 1985 and Mr. Schulman deftly shows how the country's political power shifted from the Northeast to the South and how the country moved from the prevailing liberalism of the left to the conservative right.  Along the way he discusses the presidencies of Nixon, Carter &amp; Reagan and the social and cultural movements such as Women's Lib, The New South, Minority Equality and others as well as issues like property taxes, environmentalism, skyrocketing inflation and the energy crisis.  Interspersed among all the political talk is a look at the music, film, television and how they mirrored the times.  Mr. Schulman does a superb job of showing how the 70's seemed to a time of malaise, but actually shaped our country more than we think.	2001-06-26

They had been a big success in Europe, but in America, they were somewhat popular, but not superstars. Up to that point, they had never had a top ten album or single.  That all changed when The Joshua Tree was released.  The album was an instant smash, spent a staggering 9 weeks at number one and spawned two number one singles, &quot;With Or Without You&quot; &amp; &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;.  They became the biggest band in the world and rock and roll icons.  This book deals with the creative process of the recording of this seminal release.  You get some good insights into the thought process behind the album. The one drawback is the book's size.  It comes in a cd jewel case and is the size of a cd booklet.  It doesn't feel like you are actually reading a book.  Other than that, if you love The Joshua Tree, then you should check this book out.	2001-05-21

Ellis has written an interesting account of the germination of the political beginnings of the United States, the longest running republic in history.  He shows the incredible foresight these men had in forming the laws of the country and how their decisions directly affect the way we live today.  He dispells some myths and offers keen insights into what really happened in history.  He had previously written a book on Thomas Jefferson, so it's no surprise that Mr. Jefferson plays a prominent role in this book and is portrayed in the highest regards.  But it is interesting to learn how influential James Madison was.  He is rarely mentioned amongst Jefferson, Franklin, Adams or Washington, but he played a major role in the history of the country Specifically in his determination of placing the nation's capital in Washington ,D.C., which at th time was basically swamp land.  There are many other great pieces of information including what really happened in the Burr-Hamilton duel.  Mr. Ellis notes that nowadays there is a flooding of books regarding the men and woman of the World War II era being the greatest generation.  While he does not dispute that generation's greatness, he makes a compelling argument that the Revolutionary generation is far and away the greatest generation in the country's history.  After reading this book, it's tough to argue.	2001-05-15

Most of those years, they haven't even been competitive, but the fans still fill up Wrigley Field game after game.  They know the Cubbies aren't going to win, in fact they expect to lose.  David Claerbaut's book focuses on the years of 1967-1972 when the Cubs put together the most impressive team in baseball, yet never won a division, much less a World Series.  Mr. Claerbaut, using statistics, all star appearances, future hall of famers on the roster and other items to show that those Cubs in fact are the greatest team to never win a championship.  Mr. Claerbaut is from Milwaukee and was originally a Braves fan, but converted to the Cubs after the Braves won the 1957 series.  He writes the book as a fan and it is clear he loves the legendary Leo &quot;The Lip&quot; Durocher.  But once you get past the fanatic aspect, the book offers some great information on team that due to never making the playoffs, had never gotten the attention they deserved.  If your a Cubs fan, then this book will definitely interest you.  If you are a student of the game, you will enjoy it as well.  It is a good, but not great read.	2001-05-15

Even native Australians are unaware of many of the treasures in their country.  Mr. Bryson takes us on a magical journey through the land down under, moving between major cities like Sydney &amp; Melbourne to remote Outback posts like Alice Springs.  Through it all he relays interesting stories about the country including its origins as a penal colony, its government, the incredible assortment of deadly creatures that live there, the men who first explored the dangerous Outback and other great stories too numerous to list.  We also get Mr. Bryson's personal anecdotes and stories of his trip that are always humorous and many times insightful.  Being that it takes 26 hours by plane to reach Australia, most of us probably won't get the chance to visit the country or if we ever do, we won't have the time to explore its vastness.

The book also details their live work which is the band is renowned for.  Mr. Platt has written a superb book that is another great volume in the Classic Rock Series.	2001-03-21

He has changed his image and persona and taken on alter egos so many times it's tough to remember them all.  One that rises above them all and is impossible to forget is Ziggy Stardust.  The image of the androgynous glam rocker has lived on and gave rise to Mr. Bowie's most critically acclaimed and arguably best album.  Mark Paytress examines the making of the album as well as the circumstances surrounding the creation of Ziggy Stardust and his Spiders From Mars.  The book also details Mr. Bowie's career before the album with the most revealing and interesting being his early days in the music business.  Mr. Paytress writes in too much a fan style as opposed to a journalistic style, but overall it is a solid book.	2001-03-21

A double album consisting of down and dirty, bluesy songs about the decadence the band was spiraling down into.  They were drinking heavily and doing alot of the drugs and the music mirrored their state of mind.  John Perry does alot of writing about the band, but seemingly glosses over the album itself.

The book opens with Mr. Schlosser detailing the origins of fast food restaurants that began in Southern California.  He spends a good deal of time with the leader in fast food chains, McDonald's.  One would think that Ray Kroc actually founded it, but he didn't.  It was actually started as a lone restaurant in San Bernadino, CA by two brothers named McDonald.  Mr. Kroc was a salesman who took the idea of the chain and franchised it throughout the nation.  But the book isn't just about the restaurants themselves, but the industries that supply them with their meat, potatoes and the like.  Mr. Schlosser focuses in on the meatpacking industry and he artfully skewers the almost medieval work environments that the industry leaders allow to exist.  You read about the startling callousness that the industries have towards their employees.  Mr. Schlosser also comments on the influence that the fast food industry has over our culture as a whole.  He has a mixed view of what the fast food industry is.  He respects and admires what the founders of the various chains and other industries did in their starting up of their companies.  They were inventive, industrious and determined to succeed.  But somewhere along the line, greed and the bottom line crept in.  After reading Fast Food Nation, you may think twice about the next time you step into a McDonald's or buy a piece of meat from the supermarket.	2001-03-21

After twenty years of living there, he was moving back to the States.  Notes From A Small Island details his final trip around the country before he moved away.  The book is part travelogue and part memoir as Mr. Bryson takes us along on his present journey as well as looking back to his initial arrival in England and other past adventures.  Mr. Bryson employs a sharp wit and self-deprecating humor that makes the book quite enjoyable.  Amid the humor and light heartedness, there is a sense of melancholy.  Mr. Bryson had called England home for twenty years and you can sense the mixed emotions he has about leaving.  This adds a personal touch to the book that makes you feel like a welcomed guest on his trip.	2001-03-21

Locked in a high stakes game of chicken, the world's two most powerful nations, US &amp; USSR, faced off over the Soviet Union's deployment of nuclear warheads in Cuba.  Robert Kennedy was the Attorney General at the time and this book (written shortly before his death) is his personal account of the Thirteen Days that the world waited in fear of a possible nuclear holocaust.  We see the innerworkings of the committee that the President formed to advise him on how to proceed.  Mr. Kennedy's writing vividly expresses the enormous pressure these few gentlemen were under.  They literally had the weight of the world on their shoulders and one wrong move could spell total annihilation.  Being the President's brother, he also is able to give us a view of the President that a normal cabinet member wouldn't be able to give.  The book also contains correspondence between JFK &amp; Kruschev, previously classified photos and transcriptions of speeches that JFK gave at the time.  For someone who remembers the Crises, this book will bring back strong memories and for those of us who weren't alive, the book details an important time in our country's history.	2001-03-21

Although they had arguments and outbursts (Ringo actually quit during the White Album sessions) before, this project brought all of their ill feelings to a head.  Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighart extensively detail practically every minute of the project.  We get some of the ideas the band were floating around at the time with the possible return to the concert stage being the most interesting.  The one problem with the book is that it is unauthorized and you don't get any real first hand recollections from the major players.  That aside, you can tell that the two authors are devout fans and their enthusiasm shines through the darkest period of the band.	2001-03-21

The book again incorporates real life characters including the famed lawyer Clarence Darrow and the woman rights activist Elizabeth Cady Staton.  The book also moves out of New York city into the upstate town of Saratoga.  As with the first book, Mr. Carr's description of turn of the century Saratoga is vivid.

A lawyer fakes his own death, steals 90 million from his partners and escapes to South America.  Patrick Lanigan is the lawyer and after four years, he is caught and brought back to Biloxi to face charges against him.  Before returning he is almost tortured to death and due to this he is allowed to stay in a hospital instead of jail.  While in the hospital he clues his lawyer and his judge friend in on the details of his escape. Everything falls into place too easily and of course Patrick gets away with everything.  No one would have as much luck as he had or be that smart to get away with it and it makes the story not very believable.  The ending does a fairly interesting twist, but the problem with it is that you see it coming about five chapters before it happens.	2001-03-05

He got away from crisp writing and strong character studies of his first two books and threatened to lapse into hackdom.  On The Rainmaker, he gets back to those original traits.  Rudy Baylor is a young lawyer who looses his job with a promising firm and has no other prospects.  He worked at a bar where shady characters frequented and the owner who likes him hooks him up with a small law firm. It is a less than scrupulous firm, with an ambulance chasing attitude.  Rudy is schooled in the art of hanging around hospitals from Deck, a squirrelly little guy.  In the meantime he moves into an apartment over the garage of a lonely old widow, Miss Birdie.  He tends to her yard and starts working with her on her will.  He also gets a case for a young man whose dying and his health insurance company refuses to pay for his medical treatments.  While hanging around the hospital, he meets Kelly, who turns out to be a victim of spousal abuse.  He gets involved with her while working on his cases.  The case against the insurance company is a classic David vs. Goliath scenario.  Mr. Grisham expertly weaves all these plot lines together and keeps the pages turning with bright, vivid and entertaining writing.  The Rainmaker is the best book of his career.	2001-03-05

The plot revolves around a serial killer who is preying on very young (12, 13 years old) boy prostitutes in New York City.  The police have no suspects and no real leads.  Sounds familiar, but the twist is that the story takes place in 1896.  The story is told from the perspective of a New York Times reporter, John Schuyler Moore.  His friend is Laszlo Kreizler, who is a controversial psychologist (they were called Alienists at the time, thus the book's title) and together are brought into the case by their mutual friend, NYC Police Commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt.  Mr. Carr expertly mixes real life characters like Roosevelt with his fictional ones.  The two bring in a young aggressive woman (and friend) Sara Howard and two brothers, detectives, Luscious &amp; Marcus Isaacison.  The Isaacison's subscribe to a new and highly controversial method of police work, forensics.  Together with the help of two of Dr. Kreizler's charges Stevie &amp; Cyrus, they track the killer through psychological profiles and forensic evidence.  They face numerous roadblocks along the way, but the book climaxes in a rousing and thrilling end.  Mr. Carr does an incredible job of detailing New York City in the late 19th century.  Through his vivid descriptions, you can imagine what the city was like at the time.  The Alienist is a very fascinating story and a great read.	2001-02-23

Between the shoes and clothing line, all the commercials, the image, the accolades, the title of ultimate champion, one can sometimes forget that before he won his first title in 1991, people viewed Mr. Jordan in a different light.  He was looked at a tremendous scorer, but not a winner.  People questioned whether he would tone down his scoring and become more of a team player in order to breakthrough and win a title.  The name of the book comes from the Detroit Piston's rules against playing Jordan.  Sam Smith was a beat reporter for the Bulls and his insights into the innerworkings of the team during their first title run in 1990-91 are revealing and entertaining.  Though his views of Mr. Jordan sometimes cast him in a less than favorable light (in reading the book you get the feeling that Mr. Smith is not a big Jordan fan), what he does show is that Mr. Jordan had an intense desire to be the best at everything he does.  It is this intensity that made him the greatest ever.  Every fan of Michael Jordan or fan of the game of basketball should read this book as it is an interesting chapter in the career of the best ever to lace up the sneakers.	2001-02-23

In 1984-85, the Lakers won their third title of the decade (second under Riley) over their hated rivals the Boston Celtics.  There were high expectations for the 85-86 season, but they were knocked out of the playoffs by the underdog Houston Rockets and failed to defend their title.  The book takes us through the 86-87 season in which Mr. Riley strives to get his team back on top.  We get to see how an NBA season underfolds from the point of view of arguably the best coach in history.  He gives an insider's  thoughts on all-time greats like Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy.  Mr. Riley has a wry sense of humor and his take on things makes this book a highly entertaining and insightful read.	2001-02-23

Jake Brigance is the lawyer who represents Carl Lee Hailey in the small Mississippi town of Clanton.  Carl's young daughter is viciously raped by a couple of rednecks.  The rednecks are on trial, but Carl takes matters into his own hands and kills them.  Carl is black and this incident has split the town along racial lines.  Was is justifiable homicide or premeditated murder?  Should he get the death penalty or be acquitted?  Grisham is a lawyer so his intimate understanding of the way a lawyer approaches a case and how a trial unfolds is letter perfect.  The book is a quick and easy read and highly enjoyable.	2001-02-22

Unfortunately, The Pelican Brief doesn't come close to matching the high quality of The Firm.  The plot revolves around the assassination of two Supreme Court justices that no one can figure out the motives behind.  A young law student, Darby Shaw, comes up with a theory about it and writes a paper detailing her thoughts.  It turns out to be more accurate than anyone thinks.  Her boyfriend is one of her professors and he is killed in a car bombing.  She fears for her live and ends up with a Washington Post reporter, Gray Grantham.  They set out to prove Darby's theory.  The book is a fast read, but the plot is so far fetched and unbelievable that you find yourself shaking your head at it instead of being taken in by it.  Mr. Grisham was obviously trying to capitalize on The Firm's success, but The Pelican Brief has the feel of being too forced and knocked off without much thought.	2001-02-22

He is the classic struggling law student, he has no money, lives in a shoebox apartment and drives a broken down heap of a car.  Upon graduating, he is flooded with offers for his services, but instead of following the normal course of a top Harvard law student and taking a job with a big New York City law form, he chooses the small firm of Bendini, Lambert &amp; Locke in Memphis.  Despite its small size, the company offers Mitch a new BMW, a nice house, student loan relief and lots of other perks.  Mitch and his wife move to Memphis to start their new life.  At first everything seems ideal, but things are quite what they seem.  Mitch wonders why no one ever quits the firm and the mysterious deaths of lawyers who are malcontents.

Prior to the book, most people didn't know about this subculture.  We knew about gangsters like Al Capone and the like, but not about the families. As we all know, The Godfather is about the Corleone family lead by the Don Vito Corleone.  The book follows the path of The Godfather Saga movie which combines the two movies in a more chronological pattern. If you've seen the movies, you can see that they follow the book quite closely.  Most of what happens in the movies unfolds in the book.  The difference between the two is that the book fleshes out lesser characters like Luca Brassi and explains situations like how Michael gets back to America from Italy that due to time constraints, the movie can't into.  If you loved the movies, then you'll love the book.	2001-02-22

(Globe Adapted Classics)	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Literary Classic	The word classic gets thrown around alot in describing books, movies, music, etc.  Very few books can claim that title, but John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath is one of them.  The book was released in 1939 during the Great Depression and it details the journey The large Joad family takes from Oklahoma to California.  The family at one time had a burgeoning farm, but the land dried up and became barren.  They are told that California is the land of milk and honey and jobs would be waiting for them.  They face hardships and discrimination along the way.  They are looked down upon as dirty Okies and life isn't so sweet.  Life is bleak and Mr. Steinbeck's vivid description of the camps that the Joad's set up in are heartbreakingly depressing.  The heart of the book is Ma &amp; Pa Joad's oldest son Tom.  Tom is Mr. Steinbeck embodiment of the struggle of the little guy in America at the time.  He has committed crimes, but he doesn't do them because he is bad, but he is forced to out of desperation.  The Grapes Of Wrath is not an uplifting story, but it is an incredible, real, believable American tale and a true literary classic.	2001-02-22

He had written several books on sports (including an excellent book on Michigan's Fab Five) that were not best sellers.  So when he published this small book about becoming reacquainted with a former mentor who was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease, no one expected much from it.  What has happened is that the book has become a cultural landmark.  The book has spent over three years on The New York Times Best Seller list, has been made into an Emmy award winning TV movie starring Jack Lemmon and made Mr. Albom into a star who has his radio show simulcasted on MSNBC and a development deal with CBS.  The book details how through his death, Morrie Schwartz taught Mr. Albom how to live.  Mr. Albom had seen his old professor on Nightline and decided to visit him.  He was wrapped up in his own life and felt ashamed and nervous around the dying Morrie.  In course of their initial meeting, they decide they would meet every Tuesday in what would be the last class Mr. Schwartz would teach.  Mr. Schwartz explains that dying people don't want pity, but dignity and that death is a natural part of life.  The lessons he teaches are somewhat depressing, but they do help one appreciate life.  The book is very easy to read and Mr. Albom has an inviting style of writing.  He lets us into his life and his relationship with Mr. Schwartz and through the book you can feel the genuine respect and love they had for each other.  Mr. Albom wrote the book as a true labor of love and as a testament to his friend.	2001-02-22

Whatever side of the fence you may fall on, Jan Stuart has written an interesting, insightful account of the making of a complex film.  Through interviews with just about everyone involved in the film, Mr. Stuart gives us an insider's view of not only the movie itself, but of the film's maverick director.  We are transported back to the July &amp; August, 1974 when the cast and crew invades the Music City.  Mr. Stuart paints a vivid picture of the town at that time and the feelings of the city's residents towards the Hollywood people.  We get detailed accounts of the origins of the film, the path screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury took to creating the 24 characters and writing the script, the casting choices for the roles (how some actors like Robert Duvall, Louise Fletcher and Susan Anspach backed out), the filming of the scenes and the mood off camera.  Mr. Stuart offers so much detail that you feel as if you were actually on the set.  As with any book written about a movie, Mr. Stuart obviously considers Nashville to be a masterpiece and Mr. Altman to be a genius.  Although he does praise both, the book is not a gushing love letter towards them.  He does not overtly interject his feelings and tempers the praise by detailing the criticism the film received.  All in all, Mr. Stuart lives up to the high standards of the movie, by writing a superb book.	2001-01-26

Storm Thorgerson &amp; Aubrey Powell formed the duo Hipgnosis and they designed most of Pink Floyd's albums and others as well, so their opinions on what makes a great album cover carry alot of weight.  Some of the albums you'll recognize, some you've never seen or even heard of the artist, but they are all visually interesting and the tidbits of information about them are highly interesting.	2001-01-08

Berke Breathed created one of the most bizzare collection of cartoon characters, mixing animals and people with neither one noticing.  Billy &amp; The Boingers Bootleg in part chronicles the metal band Billy &amp; The Boingers which had Bill The Cat on tongue &amp; Opus on electric tuba.  They were metal gods and their crazy antics were an obvious swipe at all the Parents Against Explicit Lyrics action that was going on at the time.  The events taking place in the meadow also find Opus getting a girlfriend, Lola, and other incidents that mirrored the times. For anyone who remembers the 80's, Bloom County remains a touchstone.  The original release contained a 45 that had two Boingers songs and the back cover is a hilarious spoof of U2's Joshua Tree album cover.	2001-01-08

Thomas Ryan advises that he was not a big Jimmy Buffett fan before he started writing the book, but grew to become one.  The book reviews all of Mr. Buffett's albums and you get an honest take from the author. If you have never been to Jimmy Buffett concert, you get a feel of what it's like to be there. The book is quick and easy to read as you can skip around the chapters. Hardcore parrot heads may be put off by the book, but if you area fan of Mr. Buffett, this is nice book to have on yourself.	2000-12-20

The films inclusions were based on not only quality, but on inventiveness and influence.  The films are not ranked, but merely presented in alphabetical order.  The real interest of the book is that the reviews are reprints from their actual newspaper appearances.  You get the first impressions of the reviewers and they are not diluted by the hindsight that you get in other film review compilations.  Vincent Canby practically invented the role of the film critic and to read his reviews are a real treat.  Even with 1000 movies, there are some omissions like Jaws, but overall, the book is an interesting read for anyone who is a film buff.	2000-12-20

The premise of the book is that Mr. Queenan is immersing himself in pop culture phenomenon like Cats to find out why something so bad is loved by millions.  He goes to Andrew Lloyd Weber plays, listens to music like Michael Bolton, goes to Red Lobsters and heads out to the entertainment wasteland in Branson, Missouri.

What makes the show so funny is Mr. Carey's ability to poke fun at himself and the humorous look at every day life.  This book is written in the same style except it doesn't suffer from the restrictions of network TV. If you are scared off by vulgar language and sexual situations, then this book isn't for you.  Mr. Carey goes into tales of his life with a self-deprecating style and keen eye.  His account of his trip to Mardi Gras is hysterical and his chapter on the ability, due to his TV success, to buy a house and accoutrements is priceless. The three short stories that make up the end of the book are extremely funny as well.  One minor setback is the chapter of big dick jokes.  A few of them are very funny, but he drags it out for too long and they get a little tedious.  Overall, this is an extremely enjoyable read and just like his show, laugh out loud funny.	2000-12-04

It is a must if you have the first volume as it wraps up the first season.  It is interesting to see how the writing improves as the year went along. The characters start building deeper personalities and we get to know them better.  That is always the key with successful TV shows, the ability to connect and relate to the characters and caring about how their &quot;lives&quot; turn out.

You get the background information on her career leading up to Buffy, but nothing revealing and it has appeared in countless other bios and is written in the dumbed down fanzine style. You also get episode reviews of the first couple of seasons but they are not enlightening. What saves this book is the info on the web sites, clubs and other stuff for fans to get involved.  Also, there is a quiz and alot of color photos.  If you like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Buffy and you don't own other bios on her, this book is as serviceable as any of the other bios out there.

Mr. Miles was and is close friend of Mr. McCartney's dating all the way back to the heights of the Beatles reign.  This book gives you the background biographical that most McCartney &amp; Beatles biographies have but what separates this from the others is the oral history from Mr. McCartney himself.  His insights into his relationship with John Lennon, the swinging London scene of the 60's, days on the road with the Beatles and most importantly, the stories behind the songwriting and creating of the Beatles songs are revealing and engrossing.  Of particular interest are the chapters on Sgt. Pepper's, the White Album, the creation of Apple Records, the first few weeks he spent with soon to be wife Linda in New York City and the ultimate demise of the Beatles.  The book is a bit lengthy and some chapters could have been trimmed down (the chapter on the time in India with the Maharishi is one to note), but if you are a fan of Paul McCartney or the Beatles, you will not find a book that matches the insight in this one.	2000-12-04

As the title suggests, Mr. Rosen tells the story of behind the making of every number one album.  This book is kind of like a mini Behind The Music.  You may or may not know the stories behind albums by major artists like The Beatles, The Stones, Springsteen and so on, but it's stories of the more obscure artists like Gerry Rafferty, Janis Ian, Pantera &amp; Vangelis that are the most interesting.  Not only do you get the album's story, you get a track listing, the date it reached number and weeks at number one.  A great book and hopefully it will be updated with the most recent number one albums.	2000-12-04

Despite the fact that the team made the Super Bowl last year, they did it as the Titans and not in Houston, but Tennessee.  There are so many other near misses and could have beens with this franchise and this book humorously accounts the almost 40 years of Oilers history.  The book is nicely broken up into chapters for each season and although there is some historical inaccuracies, the book isn't about stats or names.  The book is about the missteps and blunders the team's management has made through the years, so it's kind of appropriate that John Pirkle makes some errors along the way.  If you're an Oiler fan, this is a must read and if you are not fan, this book is still enjoyable as it is funny and has a nice cynical edge to it.	2000-12-04

The Script Book for Season One has the scripts for six episodes and not only do you get the scripts themselves, but you get insight from the writers and scenes that didn't make it onto the actual episode.  The writers have their fingers on the heartbeat of teenagers and through the guise of a vampire slayer fighting monsters, they convey the fears and uncertainty of going through high school.  A great read and I look forward to future volumes.	2000-12-04

Most people think that Mr. Lennon lived those last years in domestic bliss, taking care of Sean, baking bread with his biggest worry being what to watch on TV.  Robert Rosen once had access to Mr. Lennon's personal diaries and he reveals that those above notions aren't the actual truth.  The John Lennon we read about it in this superb book is a very fragile man who was concerned about his weight, his relationship with his first son Julian, his own relevance.  We learn of his bizarre belief in numerology and how he delighted in any misfortune that befell Paul McCartney especially his drug bust in Japan.  Mr. Rosen doesn't just focus on the failings of John Lennon, he tells stories of his tender relationship with Sean, the pride he took in learning how to sail and of his captaining a boat and the recording of Double Fantasy.  The book also chillingly details the downward spiral of Mr. Lennon's assassin Mark David Chapman and the days and months leading up to him actually firing the shots that ended Mr. Lennon's life.  Nowhere Man expertly breaks down the final chapters in John Lennon's life and we see him as a human being and not just a reclusive rock star.	2000-11-28

In that book he extensively looked at the lower end of the tour, Q School, in which golfers competed to gain a Tour Card that would allow them to opportunity to play on the PGA Tour. In his latest, The Majors, he dives into the other end of the spectrum as he dissects the four tournaments that make up the Grand Slam and the elite golfers chasing the immortality of being a Majors champion.  As usual, Mr. Feinstein's research is impeccable and we get some in depth information about the history of each of the tournaments, especially that of the Masters.  While Tiger woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson and other stars are profiled, the real star of the book is Mark O'Meara who won two majors in '98 after previously winning none.  As he notes several times in the book, a golfer is never considered to be a truly great golfer unless he has a Majors victory on his resume.  Mr. O'Meara had long been considered the best of the B's (golfers without a major) and the insight we get into his quest of a Major is superb journalism.  The one negative of the book is that too often we get into the personal lives and relationships of the golfers and those sections start to read like a copy of Tiger Beat.  That aside, this book is a good read and has the right balance that will appeal to both the hardcore and casual golf fan.	2000-11-28

The 70's were a decade of change and excess and baseball mirrored those strange times. Society started to accept men with longer hair, mustaches, crazy clothes and looser mores and baseball did the same. Players grew their hair long, grew mustaches and many teams changed their uniforms to contain gaudy bright colors moving away from the typical bland grays. The DH was introduced into the game, night baseball became more prevalent and of course the advent of free agency, all of which changed the game into what it is today. We read about the A's dynasty, the reemergence of the Yankees, the Big Red Machine, the tragic losses of Clemente and Munson, the wife swapping of two Yankee pitchers and other bizarre tales. There seemed to be more characters in the game at that time and Mr. Pepe gets into the changes and characters as told by the players themselves. You won't be able to put the book down as it is an easy and enjoyable read. A must for any fan of the game.	2000-11-28

In his latest book, he actually takes on the histories of two teams, the vaunted Cardinals and the hapless Browns.  In addition to the story of the teams, you get a history lesson of the city of St. Louis which is fairly interesting.  Mr. Golenbock spends alot of time on the Cardinals from their origins through the World Series years of the 1960's.  After that he spends virtual no time on the 70's teams and very little on the 80's teams even though they won a World Series in '82 and made two others.  Trying to grab the younger reader, he devotes too much space to McGwire's home run chase which even though it only took place two years ago, has already be written about to death.  The chapters on the Browns are mildly interesting if only for the Bill Veeck stories.  Overall the book is a decent read and contains some interesting antidotes from Stan Musial, Red Schoendist, Curt Flood, Tim McCarver, Dizzy Dean and others.	2000-11-28

You get every top ten chart from 1963 to 1998 and it makes for fascinating reader for any chart fan.  The 60's are the most interesting decade to review because of the incredible diversity of the albums listed.  On any given week, the top ten could contain such strange bedfellows as The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, a Broadway Cast Album, Herb Alpert, The Supremes and so on.  As the years wear on, the diversity wanes, but it is still a great read.  The Billboard Top Ten Album Charts is a must have for your chart collection.	2000-11-16

After the first two books in the series took place in exclusively in the L.A. area, Mr. Crais sends Elvis across the country to the East Coast.  The book starts out with Elvis being contacted by Peter Alan Nelsen, who is a big time action movie director, to locate his missing first wife and son. The meeting between Elvis and Nelsen at Nelsen's office is hilarious. In Peter Alan Nelsen, Mr. Crais perfectly captures the stereotypical, self-absorbed Hollywood type. After Elvis takes the case, his search leads him to a sleepy little Connecticut town where he locates Karen (the first wife) and Toby (the son).  What Elvis discovers is that Karen isn't leading the simple country life, she's laundering money for the mob.  Elvis took on the Japanese mafia in Stalking The Angel and this time he gets a crack at the fabled New York mafia in a way that only Elvis can.  Taking the storyline out of L.A. is a nice change of pace as we get to see Elvis outside of his normal element.  Lullaby Town further cements Mr. Crais as a great mystery writer and he keen eye and sharp wit are further honed in this third entry in the series.	2000-11-14

Elvis and his partner Joe Pike try to weed out corruption in the L.A. Police Department.  They are approached by a young woman who thinks her police officer finance is involved is less than scrupulous activities.  We know that Pike was a one-time L.A. cop and we learn a little bit more about his time on the force.  What we discover is that he didn't leave on the best of terms and the mention of his name still rankles some of the men in blue.  Free Fall loses some momentum in terms of the plot, but Mr. Crais is more interested in peeling back some of Joe Pike's layers and exposing more of his skin (an area that will be further explored in future releases).  As usual, Mr. Crais spikes his plots with liberal doses of humor and comes up with yet another winner	2000-11-14

Jodi Taylor is a popular actress who was given up for adoption at birth in the state of Louisiana.  She hires Elvis to search out her biological parents for medical reasons.  She has also retained the rights of a Louisiana lawyer who specializes in situations like hers.  Elvis heads down to Baton Rouge to meet the lawyer and search for the parents.  When Elvis walks into Lucy Chenier's office, he is immediately head over heels in love. The chapters where this initial meeting takes place and a dinner between the two are classics.  The story takes us through the small town south and we met less than honorable police chiefs, parish officials, double dealers and a killer snapper turtle.  Elvis eventual does find Jodi's biological parents and that turns out to be a major surprise.  All throughout the story, the relationship between Elvis and Lucy begins to take shape and grow.  This is the first time that a real love interest for Elvis is introduced and it gives the character another dimension.  After the Monkey's Raincoat, the three subsequent books were entertaining but were threatening to get predictable.  With Voodoo River, Mr. Crais ups the ante and comes back strong.  Just as he did with his adopted home of Los Angeles, Mr. Crais takes us through the nooks and crannies of his birthplace.  This is an immensely enjoyable read and is right up there with the Monkey's Raincoat.	2000-11-14

It's a real challenge to write about teams that basically stink.  Mike Shropshire had the unenviable task of covering a bad ballclub, the Texas Rangers, in the  late 70's.  Although the Rangers of that era are not the worst team in  baseball history, they did challenge the Oakland A's for the division title  in the '74 season, it's the way the owner ran the team and the overall  indifference fans felt towards them that makes it hellish for Mr.  Shropshire.  He also had to sit through bad baseball in the middle of Texas  summers, the heat alone probably made it fell like he was in his own  personal hell. The best part of this book is Mr. Shropshire's tales of the  Spring Training activites of the team and himself.  They are extremely  funny and Mr. Shorpshire delivers them with the right amount of  self-deprication as to not seem above it all. It doesn't hurt his story  that he got to cover two of the most interesting managers in baseball,  Whitey Herzog and Billy Martin.  The antedoces about them are a hysterical.  Whitey, it seems, had a propensity for sitting around his office with no  pants.  We get this and other &quot;useful&quot; information about the  team.  All in all, Mr. Shropshire tells a funny tale about about a team  that didn't necessarily know how to play good baseball but knew have to  have a good time.	2000-07-11

It is not quite as  good as &quot;The Monkey's Raincoat&quot;, but it is still very  entertaining.  Elvis is deeply involved in martial arts and yoga and Mr.  Crais has him mixing it up with the Japanese mafia, whose members also  follow the discipline.  Elvis is hired by the assistant to a high profile  hotel magnate who has aligned himself with the Asian community in L.A.  An  ancient manuscript in the magnate's care has disappeared and Elvis is  brought on to find it.  Mr. Crais suffers a little bit of a sophomore slump  with &quot;Stalking The Angel&quot;.  He uses some tired mystery novels  cliches, many of the charcters are stock profiles.  Despite some of these  shortcomings, this is still an above average story and an enjoyable read.	2000-07-10

Crais is a former TV writer who wrote for Emmy Award winning series  such as L.A. Law and Hill Street Blues.  In Elvis Cole, he creates a  charcter who, on the surface, seems to be just another wise cracking  private eye, but is actually so much more.  Along with his perpetually  sunglassed partner Joe Pike, Elvis owns a P.I. Agency in Los Angeles.  Pike  is quite interesting as well.  He says little and lives life according to a  strict code of discipline.  He reminds me a little bit of Clint Eastwood  from his spaghetti western days. The book opens with Elvis meeting with  Ellen Lang &amp; her friend Janet.  It appears that Ellen's husband Mort  has kidnapped their son.  Elvis reluctantly takes the case and what appears  to be a routine case of a missing person turns into something much bigger.  Through many twists and turns involving small time Hollywood agents and  actresses, he eventually comes face to face with a Mexican crime lord, who  is a former bullfighter. He thinks Elvis has his missing cocaine and the  story ends with Elvis searching for the cocaine and a showdown in the crime  lord's compound.  Crais weaves many interesting characters into a fast  paced, humorous tale.  The book contains the right amount of twists and  turns to keep you on your toes, but not too many as to seem implausible.  He reveals just enough about Elvis &amp; Pike for us to get know them, but  leaves somethings about them uncovered, so they can be explored in future  books.  This book is as entertaining as any I ever read and if you enjoy  mystery novels, you love this one.	2000-07-10
US	52042479	R2GTNVE22X7M2M	0316038857	786749071	It Ain't No Sin to Be Glad You're Alive : The Promise of Bruce Springsteen	Books	2	7	10	N	N	A Writer's Bruce Diary	This book is more like Eric Alterman's personal diary of his devotion to  Bruce Springsteen.  The introduction of the book tells of his meeting and  shaking hands with Bruce in the green room of The Charlie Rose Show and  ends with him attending a show at the Asbury Park Convention Center before  the start of Bruce's reunion tour with the E Street Band.  In between we  get more of Alterman's account of how Bruce affected his life.  The book  does provide a biography of Bruce's life and his work, but it has been told  before and much better in other Bruce books (most notable of course is Dave  Marsh's &quot;Born to Run&quot;).  Alterman is a political and cultural  commentator and the one saving grace of the book is his commentary on  Bruce's political leanings and his effect on our culture.  Also, it  contains an account of his 90's work which has not been extensively written  about to date.  Being a huge Springsteen fan myself, I want to read  everything that comes out about him and that's what lead me to this book.  After reading it, I was very disappointed.  The book is competently written  and if it had more cultural insight and less Alterman it would have made  for a better book.  For true Springsteen devotees only.	2000-07-09

He had the public persona of being a sex machine, but privately he thought of himself as  sexually inadequate.  He praised God and His message, yet was constantly  consuming cocaine and other drugs.  He thought of himself as the prince of  soul, yet was always doubting his ability.  In fact it seems that just  about everything that Marvin Gaye did in his life was marked with both pain  and pleasure.  Ritz provides the reader with entry to the innerworking of  Gaye's mind and soul.  The chapters that contain the reviews of Gaye's  musical work (especially the one regarding his musical masterpiece What's  Going On) are extremely insightful.  The one drawback to the book is that  Ritz is a little too melodramitic in his account of the last years of  Gaye's life.  He details them in a bit of a soap opera fashion.  That is  only a minor complaint though and I would highly recommend this book.  Marvin Gaye was a tortured genius and his life makes for compelling  reading.	2000-07-09
US	52042479	R3IAUMJ5YAE838	0679735186	167686037	Independence Day: Bascombe Trilogy (2)	Books	5	32	42	N	N	American Classic	Richard Ford has created in Frank Bascome the most interesting, insightful &amp; thought provoking character in American literature since Holden Caufield.  Over the course of a Fourth of July weekend, Mr. Ford takes us  on a journey that moves from the current day to flashbacks in the life of  Frank Bascome.  He is a real estate agent in a southern New Jersey town and  one of his current clients is a couple who are looking for the ideal home.  When Frank thinks he has found the right home, they have reservations.  Frank never seems to be able to meet the couple's pie-in-the-sky  expectations and that is central theme to the book.  No matter how hard we  try, we never seem to meet of own expectations in life.  Frank has had a  failed marriage, a failed career as a sportswriter and has entered what he  calls an &quot;existance period&quot; in his life. He yearns for the days  gone by when as he says &quot;pride still mattered&quot;.  Mr. Ford's  perspectives on life in general are razor sharp and he balances the  deepness of the story with the right amount of humor so the book doesn't  become too heavy-handed.  I recommend this book as highly as any book out  there.  If you liked &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;, check this one out.  You will not be disappointed.	2000-07-04
US	52042479	RD1OAU0RZT1LA	0786884509	147568932	Anaheim Angels: A Complete History	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Inside the Angels	If you are a diehard Angels fan, you will most likely love this book.  It details the origin of the team back in the early 60's all the way through the '99 season.  If you are just a fan of the sport and not the team, like  myself, the book is just average.  Ross Newhan, who has covered the team  since its inception, spends a little too much time dealing with the Angels'  second-class citizen stauts to the Dodgers in the L.A. area (they actaully  shared Dodgers Stadium for a few years), the &quot;curse&quot; on the team  in where talented young players constantly have injuries that either  curtail or end their careers and all the  bad luck that prevented owner  Gene Autry from  making a World Series.  In reading, you would think that  the Angels are a more cursed and unlucky franchise than the Red Sox or  Cubs.  Although I'm sure there are many long suffering Angels fans out  there, even they wouldn't even compare themselves to those teams.  The one  true highlight of the book is the chapter on the '86 season in which the  Angels came within one strike of reaching the Series.  Mr. Newhan captures  all the drama, tension, frustration and ultimate disappointment of the  team, it's owner and fans in that fated season.  The rest of the book  presents mainly a pedestrian account of the team's history.	2000-06-29
