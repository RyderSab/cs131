It tells about the author's experiences in a marriage dreadful from the start, and it quickly grows to brutal domestic violence. Then she endures a severe sexual assault. Yet through all that she preserves to earn a college degree, discovers faith and support, and becomes a successful writer and lecturer. The writing is vivid, dramatic, sparse yet specific. If you or a friend have--or may have to--endure any such dreadful events, this is a \\"must read\\" book. Recommended without any reservation.	2004-05-13

They range from the famed &quot;Corn Palace&quot; in Mitchell---a building so large that it houses sports events, yet is covered each year with &quot;600,000 ears of corn of all kinds&quot;---to a &quot;complicated recipe for Swedish meathballs.&quot;<br />Author Clayton Davis writes in a casual style, tells readers pleasing tales as they apparently come to his mind. For example, in writing about the giant grain elevator in his wife's hometown, Redfield, he also informs readers a bit about concrete construction of some 2000 years ago. Then he briefs us about &quot;the first concrete reinforced bridge built in America.&quot; And he also mentions inventor Thomas Edison making &quot;houses with poured concrete (that sold) for less than $1,200 and are still standing.&quot;<br />This book has many photos, mostly family snapshots. There are pictures of the author's wedding to Irene Brink in 1952; her grandmothers---&quot;One was from Sweden and the other from Czechoslovakia;&quot; a friend's sleek racing car; uncle Charley's old cow; and more.<br />Closing the book is a laid-back description of the author's &quot;trip (to) see South Dakota the way an early mapmaker saw it.&quot; Davis reports briefly on such places as a hunting lodge where you can stay in &quot;private rooms (or) an eighteen-bed dorm;&quot; Britton, the town named for a general manager of an area railroad; Fort Sisseton, which offers &quot;A five hour guided walking tour;&quot; and other such attractions.<br />If you are interested in mostly early-Americana, based largely on &quot;first-hand accounts told by immigrants in northeasten South Dakota and archival materials,&quot; written in informal prose and structure, this may be just the book for you.	2002-01-07

One major problem faced by many---perhaps most---patients is trying to understand the jargon their doctors spout at them. But that hurdle is not perpetuated by Dr. Anil Minocha in his truly superior book HOW TO STOP HEARTBURN. Subtitled &quot;Simple Ways to Heal Hearburn and Acid Reflux,&quot; this book indeed delivers what it promises.<br />It's written in plain English with medical terms and techniques kept to a minimumn; nearly all are explained clearly, simply. Example: in the very first sentnce, Dr. Minocha writes that what doctors call &quot;gastroesophageal reflux disease&quot; is what real people call &quot;heartburn.&quot;<br />The book is comprehensive; the index lists hundreds of topics from &quot;abominal pain&quot; to &quot;Zyban,&quot; a drug that &quot;reduces the desire to smoke.&quot; (&quot;Smoking is a major contributor to the development of (heartburn).&quot; (page 228) The 17 chapters and four appendixes cover such diverse topics as the causes of hearburn, how physicians diagnosis it, finding remedies that work, related illnesses such as peptic ulcers and some hernias, when surgery is needed---even alternative treatments such as yoga, juice therapy, acupressure, and other offbeat remedies.<br />A major section of the book covers &quot;Lifestyle Changes that Work&quot;---eating, sleeping, weight loss, stress reduction, and more.<br />A glossary explains many key words, including barium swallow, dosha, manometry, proton pump inhibitor, etc.<br />Should you think you don't need this book, consider these facts that Dr. Minocha presents: hearburn &quot;is one of the most common diseases in North America;&quot; &quot;about 55 million (20% of our population) suffer from it;&quot; Americans &quot;spend over $2 billion a year on over-the-counter heartburn medications.&quot; Yet one study documented that more than half of hearburn sufferers who took antacids &quot;for more than ten years developed serious illnesses.&quot;<br />The author is recognized worldwide as an authority of what he's written about. Among his very imnpressive credentials is his being Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology for the School of Medicine, Southern Illinois University.<br />The book's last chapter is encouraging. It points out that research for new remedies is extensive. One the horizon are new medications &quot;to block acid secretion;&quot; surgery that &quot;does not require an incision;&quot; &quot;genetic advances;&quot; and more.<br />But don't want: if you suffer from heartburn, seek professional help NOW---and one of the best places to start is by reading this book.	2001-10-09

It's set aboard a modern guided-missile destroyer operating under today's conditions. The  heros are ordinary sailors---not the usual ship's leaders, not the  overly-ambivious captain, not the intriguing female gunnery officer, not  the female hiliocopter pilot, not the CIA agent, not even the dead Libyan  officer. Especially commendable, interesting, and readable is the  dialogue---in this book, sailors talk like sailors really do talk. Many  genuine navy terms are used, snf any needing translations are almost always  explained in the next sentence. When, but a few hundred words into the  story, all hands are ordered to general quarters, you read what is actually  said in such announcements, not some hokey summation. During an assignment  to retrive a defecting Libyan officer, an accident destroys the rescue  team. Facing the dread of the fast-approaching deadline set by terrorists,  it is members of the ship's crew---not the ship's officers---who  successfully carry out the hazardous mission. Among the many  excellently-written, truly thrilling scenes is the final climatic shootout,  starting on page 328---a classic of authentic navy talk and action. The  author---Timothy Joseph McFadden---knows what he's writing about. He's a  former Navy seaman who served aboard comparable navy ships. As his  shipboard career progressed, he became a military journalist. While this is  his first published novel, his writings include many published articles  about ships, several war games, and two other novels in preparation. The  book, &quot;Landing Party,&quot; is accurately summarized by the author in  these words, &quot;If you want to read about the good and the bad, the  slackers and the hard chargers, the navy when seen from the deckplates  up---this book is for you.&quot;	1999-11-08

Martha Raye---Maggie, as her friends called her---is remembered by millions for her halarious routines, largely based on her big mouth---a feature she played up herself.

Later, she was honored repeatedly by a great variety of veterans' organizations and was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
