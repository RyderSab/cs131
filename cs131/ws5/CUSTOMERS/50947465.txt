The translations into English will suit most English speakers, but those who prefer Hebrew as the language of prayer and home ritual will probably find _Gates of the House_ wanting.<br /><br />Non-Jews who want a richer spiritual life at home might consider useing this prayer book as a point of departure from which to create home rituals for their own faith. Non-Jews interested in the _Pesach Seder_ service should consult a _Haggadah;_ that service has long since become substantial enough to require its own prayer book.	2005-04-05

Some of your opponents will adopt these avant garde methods (or similar but less extreme notions from Bergen and others). Those folks will bushwhack you if you do not understand what they are doing.<br />More importantly, seeing a radically different view on competitive bidding can drive a dialogue with your steady partner. Since competitive bidding and defensive play often stand among the weakest links in a partnership, that dialogue cannot hurt. Maybe, you'll simply firm up your current agreements without adopting anything Miles describes, but the dialogue will have served a valuable purpose.	2004-05-30

Between the covers of this book, one will find everything one must know to learn the game and play it competently. For many bridge players, this single volume, can be a complete bridge library. The sections on declarer play and defensive play will be as good 100 years from now as they were the day Goren wrote them.<br />BUT<br />One could have questioned &quot;new&quot; on the original publication date. Especially for duplicate players, even the Laws of Contract Bridge have changed. More practically, bidding has evolved quite rapidly since Goren wrote this work, and the bidding ideas he presents were tried and true (that is, shop worn) before publication.<br />If you are serious about the game, augment Goren with more modern works about bidding. Marty Bergen and Marshal Miles stand tall among those who will show you modern bidding methods at the leading edge. Still, if you can find more useful, well presented, effectively indexed information about the game in any other volume, buy it and clue me in on the treasure.	2004-05-30

The presentation often suffers from a tedious dryness only a bidding theorist could love. Yet, that dryness buys a concise description of a large, natural bidding system.

Better, the presentation reaches sufficient depth so that one may add the technique to one's arsenal without further ado.

Not only does the emperor have no clothes; Kohn has the courage to say as much. He has certainly pointed out some widely held false beliefs. His examples of the damage caused by actions based on these false beliefs can only resonate with any caring, observant person who has worked in the posioned enviroments pop behaviorism can create. Kohn and the researchers he cites may have it wrong, too. That is a matter for for further study.<br />Yet, Kohn-unlike the pop behaviorists-resonates with established management gurus like Deming, Drucker, and Goldratt. Throwing in concurrances with Gallup's massive study documented by Buckingham, et al and with Schumacher's economic conclusions yields diverse support for Kohn's unorthodox (for a psychologist) views. Thinking back to the last time I took a psychology class, my money's on Kohn over the psychological conventional wisdom.	2004-04-05

They base their findings on comprehensive personal interviews of African-American and white women working as managers or executives. Ultimately, the authors hit the reader over the head with the obvious: People from strikingly different backgrounds bring profound personal differences to the workplace. Too often, organizations stupidly attempt homogenizing everyone into minor variations on the existing (typically---older, white, and male) leadership theme. Unusually (Bell and Nkomo cited no such cases), organizations may wisely embrace the differences so that the organization and its people benefit from a more perceptive and inclusive world view.<br />Folks who need not spend their working hours &quot;fitting in&quot; contribute (A) more (B) less to the organization. Leaders who accept their people for who and what they are get (A) more (B) less from their subordinates. Guess where the authors suggest the readers take their outfits.	2004-02-03

In an apparent effort to explain not ony typhus, but epidemic disease generally, to the educated lay reader, Zinsser has gone one better. By explaining the infection mechanism and the organism life cycle, he introduces cause and effect logic and scientific thought (if not scientific method) with an elegant case study. Here, in his simple case study, one can learn that (not so obvious) causes and (powerful) effects need not appear near one another in either space or time. Observing the systemic effects in the typhus life cycle offers insight into systems thinking that will well serve any engineer or business leader. Zinsser's brilliant presentation of the typhus life cycle as a cause and effect system with delays may be among the earliest, and most comprehensible, public examples of the modern systems engineering (or ecological) thought processes. The reflected glow of the \\"light bulb effect\\" from others' (then) new ideas readers seen through Zinsser's eyes illuminates the way good scientists, doctors, engineers, and business leaders (among others) understand our world so that they can safely institute improvements. If you would rather be part of the solution than part of the problem, this volume can help open your eyes. _Rats, Lice, and History_ should be required reading for CEOs, lawyers, politicians, and revolutionaries.	2002-07-08

If you play bridge competitively, you and your favorite partners need this book. Any two bridge players will have at least four opinions about any bidding sequence involving a negative double. Thus, you and your partner probably miss each other more often than not after an opponent overcalls your side's opening bid. Bergen explains clearly and comprehensively how you and your partner can change that.<br />Exactly copying Bergen's ideas may not be for you and yours. That understood, studying his ideas and considering the alternatives can only help your partnership develop your ideas and understandings. With a united position on negative doubles, an adverse overcall will lose some of its sting. Better, you and your partner will know much better when and why lowering the penalty pass boom on the overcaller is better than bidding on.<br />Bergen's Negative Doubles is a foundation stone in the competitive bridge player's library. Read it, let your partner read it, apply it, and watch your opponents weep.	2002-06-30

Decision makers need information that will help them understand the likely results following from their choices. Most managerial accounting systems offer (at best) a glance at where an organization has been. Beginning with understanding the questions decision makers must answer to make effective decisions, Goldratt moves to how one might go about building an INFORMATION (NOT data) system which can offer up the answers to those questions.<br />Unfortunately, the valuable result will be heavy going for many readers. Particularly, the more narrowly one has specialized, the less likely it is that one will have the breadth of understanding needed to grasp the whole without help from one's associates. Team reading with an IT person, an accounting person, a manufacturing person, and an executive in the team should add value for all readers and their organization.	2002-06-13
