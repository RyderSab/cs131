If we pay attention to everyday news, we could see that most of the formulas mentioned in this &quot;report&quot; have being applied around the world in a systematic way as isolated cases successfully with none or few opposition by the victims.  I strongly recommend this book to those people that in some way or another can do something to stop this systematic plan already running.	2002-05-16
