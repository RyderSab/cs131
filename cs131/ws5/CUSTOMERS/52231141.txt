My first introduction to Ms. Keyes' work came through a double volume containing SENATOR MARLOWE'S DAUGHTER and THE GREAT TRADITION, both wonderful stories.  Over the years I've bought and read all of her books, and I've never been disappointed.  I can see how some readers might think her writing is slow.  That's because she takes time to give rich details of the time period, her settings, and the backgrounds for her plots.  Her impeccable research is second to none.  But that's not why I love her work so much.  What she does best is tell a great story.  In the end, that's the difference between her work and that of lesser writers.  Some of them have forgotten that first and foremost they are supposed to be story tellers.  Ms. Keyes' books stand the test of time, because great writing and story telling will never go out of style.  If you have a chance to read any of her novels, don't pass it up.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-09-20

US	52231141	R2XTKYRUGM9KTI	0451214153	961383120	Walking with Her Daughter	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Touching Story	This is the fourth book by Ms. Inclan that I've bought and read.  As always, she tells her story beautifully and with great skill and sensitivity, although sometimes her run-on sentences make me grit my teeth (but that's a minor picky).  This book tackles any parent's worst nightmare: the death of a child.  And the way Sophie dies is particularly horrible.  That first part of the book, where Inclan shows us Jenna's ordeal in identifying the body and grappling with the knowledge of what her beloved daughter suffered is so compelling and so terrifyingly real that I could hardly stand to read it.  I was actually trembling, that's how powerful the writing was.  In fact, if all I'd read was the first half of this book, I'd've wanted to give it 10 stars.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the last half of the book couldn't sustain that power, and the whole meditation scene seemed too contrived to me.  I also had a problem buying into Jenna's relationship with Tim.  I never felt the attraction between them, whereas I did see (and feel) the connection between Jenna and Mark, her ex-husband.  All in all, though, this is a book I would recommend to my daughters, sisters, and women friends, for in many ways, it's a superior story.  As always, I will look forward to Ms. Inclan's next book.	2005-08-25

Avery isn't her most sympathetic heroine, although what she goes through in trying to get pregnant does make you like her, even though the way she treats Daniel after finding out about him takes away some of that sympathy.  That said, the characterization of Avery is just what it should be.  She is not an idealized heroine.  Instead, she is very human, with many of the flaws humans can have.  I thought she overreacted to Dan's past life and his decision not to tell her about it, but I understood where she was coming from and I understood why Barksdale-Inclan wrote her that way.  Overall, this is a book that will keep you turning pages far into the night.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-08-25

The two of us almost always agree about books, and she recommended ELLEN FOSTER highly.  She greatly admires Kaye Gibbons' writing.  Unfortunately, this book didn't work for me.  First of all, I hated the writing.  Difficult to interpret, difficult to read, I found myself frowning and too often left wondering what in the world Gibbons meant to say.  The story itself is nothing new.  I've read others in the same vein that I enjoyed more.  And the ending left me frowning again.  Huh? was my reaction.  Since when did racial injustice have anything to do with this story?  I felt as if Gibbons just threw that part in at the end to give the story moral weight, but since the only reference to race was in Ellen's reluctance to eat anything made by Starletta's mother, I just didn't buy it.  Different strokes for different folks . . .	2005-08-13

I've lived south of the Mason/Dixon life most of my adult life, and it didn't ring true to me.  As one other review said, it sounded more like what people in the NE imagine southerners sound like.  But that's not really important.  I could have forgiven that.  What bothered me was the implausibility of the so-called \\"twist\\" at the end.  I'm sorry, but I kept thinking about the movie, The Sixth Sense, and how once you know what's really happening you can go back and see all the clues along the way.  That wasn't true of this book.  And if I didn't already have about 250+ books sitting on my TBR shelves and not enough time to read them all, I would go back and re-read just to make sure I didn't miss those clues.  I, too, figured out exactly what was going to happen when Mr. Wilson so conveniently taught Carrie to shoot.  I wish the book hadn't fallen apart in the end, but the fact remains, it did.  Sadly, I think the author is really talented, but this particular story didn't do that talent justice.	2005-08-12

I thought the book was well-written--there's where I disagree with some other reviews here and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 or 1--but the characters left me cold.  When I read a book, I have to have someone to root for, and there was no one in this book I cared enough about except the poor victim, and I knew up front there would be no happy ending for her.  There wasn't even the promise of something good coming out of the tragedy depicted, and there was certainly no sigh of satisfaction when I finished.  This is a dark, depressing, and dismal story with main characters that are sad, pathetic people.  I probably would not buy another book by this author.	2005-08-08

Since then, I've read all her books, and although some haven't been quite up to the bar she set with her first couple of books, I've never been truly disappointed until now.  THE ART OF MENDING simply isn't up to her standards.  The characters, the plot, even the writing seem to belong to a lesser author.  I finished the book--after all, it was Elizabeth Berg!--but by the end, I felt cheated.  RECOMMENDATION: WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK.	2005-07-31

I especially love the way she incorporates information about subjects most of us know nothing about (lobstering, raising angora rabbits, etc.) without boring us to tears.  She's a master at weaving her research into her story in a way that doesn't intrude on the story itself, and I really admire that.  I would have liked to give this book five stars, but because Julia, her heroine, frustrated me so much of the time, I couldn't.  Somehow, in this day and age, I just couldn't believe an educated, sophisticated woman like Julia would be such a doormat for her husband, nor would she put up with his infidelities.  It would be different if Julia had had no resources and no way to escape his tyranny, but that wasn't the case at all.  I just don't have much patience with women who can't stand up for themselves, and by the time she finally does, I almost didn't care anymore.  Despite these problems, this is a worthwhile read, and I do recommend it.	2005-07-30

Marcia Willett is a true find, and I only wish there were more of her books available.  I didn't think she could match THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, but A WEEK IN WINTER is every bit as good.  What makes her writing so special, aside from her brilliant descriptive prose, is her characters.  Even Polonius, the dog, emerges vividly, and you feel you know him.  I chuckled over and over again when Willett described what he was thinking, because I could believe every word.  Even the antagonists in the story, like Selina, were multi-faceted and fascinating.  Willett is simply a master at creating full-bodied, believable characters who amuse, frustrate, fascinate, and engross.  She also knows how to create and maintain suspense, making me want to turn the pages faster or peek at the ending (yes, I admit it, I sometimes do that). :)  Please, Ms. Willett, can't you write faster?  I only have one more book of yours left to read, and then what?  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-07-30

It was funny, sweet, sad, poignant, charming, and filled with wry and witty observations about life, love, and the pursuit of happiness.  All three women came across as real, although CiCi tried my patience more than once.  I kept wanting her to buck up and move on with her life the way her mother and daughter were doing.  She redeems herself in the end, though.  Archer's writing is very good and you can see the promise in it.  I predict she'll be a big star one day.  You read it here first. :)  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-07-06

Daria, Shelly, and Rory were especially engaging--Chloe, Grace, and the others less so.  Kill Devil Hills and the Outer Banks are a wonderful backdrop, and Chamberlain uses them to advantage, creating an atmosphere so alive and so vivid, you feel you are right there.<br /><br />All that said, this was not my favorite of Chamberlain's books.  The ending disappointed me.  I won't spoil it for other readers by giving it away.  Let's just say that for me, the ending didn't ring true.  I couldn't suspend my disbelief.  It's obvious others didn't feel this way, and I hope what I've said won't stop anyone else from reading the book, because it's definitely worth reading.  The problem is, Chamberlain is such a marvelous writer that I always expect perfection from her, and no one can give us perfection every time.	2005-07-06

CYPRESS POINT is one of my favorites--a complex mix of mystery, romance, and family drama--the kind of book Ms. Chamberlain does so beautifully.  The whole time I was reading it I kept thinking how much I wished I'd thought of this plot first, which is the highest compliment a writer can give to another writer.

And to think I'd never read a Marcia Willett book before!  I love when I find a new author, and when the author is as talented as Ms. Willett, it's doubly gratifying.  Nest and Mina are such wonderful characters.  From their first introduction, I felt I knew them.  Since other reviewers have synopsized the story, I won't repeat what they've said.  Instead, I'll say that I found this book to be charming, warm, and rich with the minute detail that brings settings and people alive and makes you feel as if they're real and you're there with them.  Throughout I cared deeply about what happened to this family and I was so sorry to have to let them go.  As a writer myself, I am in awe of Ms. Willett's talent.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-06-26

I particularly loved the relationship between the sisters, which I found completely realistic and exceptionally touching.  Although they had their differences and were envious of each other's lives and choices, their love for each other shone through.<br /><br />Ms. Wiggs is a wonderful writer.  I don't agree with the Publisher's Weekly reviewer who said she tends to overwrite.  The thing some reviewers don't get is that descriptions of emotions are to a romance what descriptions of gore and mayhem are to a thriller.<br /><br />The only thing I'd have done differently had I written this book (and I sure wish I had!) would be not to tell Lila the truth.  Ian needed to know, yes, but I don't think any higher purpose was served by telling Lila.<br /><br />But that's a minor point in an otherwise totally engaging, intense story that gave my box of Kleenex a workout!

Although STONE HEART may not be everyone's cup of tea, I found it thoroughly engrossing and hard to put down.  Knowing nothing about the Pequot Indians, I can't comment on the review stating that Ms. Rice didn't do her research except to say I find that very hard to believe.  One of the things I've enjoyed the most about Ms. Rice's books is their authenticity and her knowledge of the Connecticut shore and ability to translate that knowledge vividly.  The book tackled a difficult subject and gave it a fresh slant.  The characters were engaging and fully realized and the family relationships were complicated and realistic.  And, as always, the writing shone.  I'm glad this book was reissued as I would hate to have missed it.  RECOMMENDED.	2005-06-06

This book is essential to anyone who is or may be involved in a child custody battle.  Every possible problem is covered, giving examples, recommendations, advice, and solutions.  There's so much information, it's almost overwhelming.  Then again, being involved in a child custody dispute is no simple matter, so you need lots of information.  Better to have too much than not enough.  One man who bought the book said it contained details he never would have thought of, but because it did, he was better prepared and won his case.  WIN YOUR CHILD CUSTODY WAR has been recommended by parents, psychologists, mediators, educators, judges, lawyers, and wardens--all of whom have firsthand knowledge of what's involved when people are fighting one another for custody of a child.  Universally, they say that it's the most comprehensive book available today, with a breadth and depth of material not found anywhere else.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-05-10

Personally, I think the book should be required reading for any couple contemplating marriage and children.  The book consists solely of actual letters written by kids to judges in family court.  Filled with love and anguish, the letters brought tears to my eyes.  These poor kids.  It's a horrible shame what we adults have put them through.  In one letter, a kid writes, \\"I want you to undivorce my Mom and Dad.  It's just not working out for me.\\"  This says it all.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2005-05-09

My son sees his child often, but we don't, not the way we would if our son and his ex were still married.  This situation gave me a unique perspective in reading this book.  I knew visitation was hard on my grandson, not because he didn't want to be with his dad or his mom, but because it's hard to be torn in two.  It's hard to have two bedrooms and two sets of clothes and two loyalties.<br /><br />Joshua Shane Evans shows us, in this book, just how hard.  So much of what I read was poignant and touching.  On Page 10, under the heading \\"Why Kids Don't Want to Go\\" he says, \\"I get left out of a lot of things my friends get to do.\\"  And the older a child gets, the harder it is to split time, to leave friends, to get \\"left out\\" of what everyone else is doing.  Even when you love the non-custodial parent and want to be with him or her.<br /><br />Much of this well-done book consists of things to do while you're visiting your other parent--things that will take your mind off what you're missing at home and that are fun.<br /><br />It's a shame kids have to suffer in a divorce, but it's a fact of life.  So it's great that there are sensitive, smart kids like Joshua, who has let them know they're not alone.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2005-05-09

I confess, I'm mystified by those readers who didn't like this book, because I loved it.  The depiction of Navy life was incredibly realistic and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about what it's like to serve on a carrier and/or land a plane on a carrier.  I also loved the Pacific Northwest setting, which Ms. Wiggs brought alive so beautifully.  But what I enjoyed most about this book were the characters.  For me, it's ALWAYS about the characters, and Steve, Grace, Brian, Emma, Katie, Josh, and Lauren crept into my heart and stayed there till the very end, with me rooting for them all the way.  This book is beautifully written and a real page-turner.  Bravo, Ms. Wiggs! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-05-07

As another reviewer said, it started out like a house afire, but there were just too many wildly implausible brushes with and escapes from death and that diminished my enjoyment to the point I was talking aloud, saying things like, \\"Oh, come ON!\\"  And believe me, I'm one of the easiest readers any author is likely to find -- I will go along with just about anything if it's well-motivated and if I like the characters and am rooting for them -- so when I have a hard time suspending disbelief, you know there's a real problem.  Perhaps one of the problems I had with this story is I've seen the movie \\"Maria, Full of Grace,\\" (also about a mule smuggling drugs from Colombia) which was so well done and believeable that anything less was certain to disappoint me.

Beautifully written, about people you care about deeply, THE KITE RUNNER tears at your heart.  One of the best parts about reading this book was learning about a country and a culture foreign to me; yet finding that despite our differences, at heart we are all alike and pretty much want the same things: life, love, and freedom.

Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors and one of a handful of authors I buy in hardcover.  Like another reviewer said, I find some of her work brilliant and some of it not as compelling.  VANISHING ACTS falls into the latter category.  I, too, felt the prison scenes were unnecessary and distracting.  In fact, I skipped over most of them.  Unfortunately, this story didn't have enough meat to sustain it, and I suspect that's why the prison scenes were included--simply to flesh it out.  That said, even a less-than-wonderful Picoult novel is better than 90% of the fiction published today, certainly it's always better written.	2005-04-09

The subject matter is difficult, yes, but it will make for spirited and lively discussion among friends and in book clubs.  But aside from the moral issue explored, MY SISTER'S KEEPER is, above all, a beautifully told story with characters that wrench your heart.  Much has been said about Ms. Picoult's ability to pick a controversial and timely subject for her books, but that's not why I read her, and I don't believe it's why her legions of fans read her.

I feel the same way.  I, too, love Gaffney's wry sense of humor and her ability to show me the world in a different way.  That said, it doesn't really surprise me that some readers were bored, because this IS a quiet, character-driven story that develops slowly, and some readers just don't have the patience for that.

I love Berg's writing and I liked many things about this book, but I couldn't rate it higher because I didn't believe in these people.  I liked Frank and I felt bad for him, but I wanted to smack him for allowing Ellen to indulge her immature behavior.  And I wanted to shake her for being so immature and self-centered and selfish.  On the plus side, even a less-than-wonderful book by Berg is better than the best other writers can produce.  Still, I'd recommend waiting for the paperback before plunking down a big chunk of cash for the hardcover.	2004-06-04

This is such a heartfelt, heartwarming, wonderful story and Sophie is such an endearing heroine.  Actually, all the characters in this book were wonderful, from Crystal to Marion to Ruth to Drew to Jasper to Chef.  I especially loved the relationship between Sophie and Crystal.  It developed in a way that seemed very real to me.  In fact, everything in the book seemed real to me.  As someone else said, I never felt manipulated, yet I deeply felt Sophie's grief and bewilderment and rejoiced with her when she began to pull herself out of her depression and back into the world.  Lolly Winston is an extremely talented writer and I'll be waiting eagerly for her next book.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2004-06-04

I'm a writer, too, and when I finished STEP-BALL-CHANGE I thought how much I wished I'd written it, and that's the highest compliment I can pay another author.  Jeanne Ray is a terrific writer.  Not only does she have a great sense of humor (and I laughed out loud many times while reading this) but she has something to say about life.  I caught myself nodding my head in agreement more than once.  I especially loved her observations about marriage.  And I absolutely loved the way she depicted Caroline's relationship with her sister.<br />Jeanne, if you read this review, don't pay any attention to the person who only gave STEP-BALL-CHANGE one star and said it was boring.  She's wrong.  This story is charming and warm and wonderful, and I hated for it to end.  And you are a WONDERFUL writer.  I only wish there were more than three Ray books to read.	2003-11-18

I didn't think I could love a book as much as I loved DOMESTIC PLEASURES, but SAYING GRACE was equally mesmerizing.  The background of a private school with all its politics and conflicts made for fascinating reading.  How Gutcheon juggled so many story lines without creating a confusing mess, I have no idea.  At first, I wasn't sure I'd ever keep all the characters straight, but before long I was pulled into each story and had no problem at all.  In fact, I felt as if I were there at The Country School right along with Rue and Emily and Mike and Chandler and Henry and all the others who peopled this story.  The book was by turns hilarious, sad, illuminating, joyous, frustrating, and heartbreaking.  It was never boring.  Once again, Ms. Gutcheon has awed me with her talent.  I only wish she would write faster.	2003-10-07

It sat on my bookshelf for a long time before I picked it up, and then I was sorry I'd waited so long.  It was a terrific read.  Yes, it was uneven in places, but the characters were so well-drawn and so alive, I didn't care.  I didn't even care that some of the plot points didn't work for me -- like Ruth taking off with Gabriel's child.  I was just having too much fun reading.  I really wanted to give this book 4 1/2 stars, but since I couldn't, and since I save 5 stars for books I wouldn't change at all, I had to settle for 4 in this case.  I'd like to thank the author for the intimate glimpse into the world of ballet.  I found it fascinating.  I love it when a story is fun to read, plus I learn something.  This book delivered on both counts.	2003-09-23

DOMESTIC PLEASURES is one of the best books I've read this year.  I'm ashamed to say it's my first by Gutcheon, but it won't be the last.  I've just now ordered all the rest of her books and am looking forward to many hours of reading pleasure, although how she can top PLEASURES, I don't know.  As an author myself, I know how difficult it is to handle as many story lines, characters, and relationships as Gutcheon gave us in this book.  Not to mention writing from the point of view of such different ages.  And Gutcheon has done both so beautifully.  From page one, I was hooked by the characters and their lives.  Martha and Charlie, Sophie and Connie, Phoebe and Jack, baby Fred and Gillis, Patsy and Molly and Ruth and William and Dave.  I don't think I'll ever forget them.  I was so caught up in their lives, I didn't want the book to end.  Gutcheon is a marvelous writer.  Not only did she make me cry a few times, she made me laugh over and over again.  Her dialogue is so good, I wanted to smack her!  &lt;g&gt;  Okay, that's because I am jealous.  I'd love to be able to write dialogue that clever and witty and real.  Bravo, Ms. Gutcheon.  I am in awe of your talent.	2003-09-12

From the first paragraph, I was hooked by McCall Smith's deceptively simple story and story telling.  Precious Ramotswe is a great character: wise and amusing, the kind of person I would love to know.  Reading about her and her friends and loved ones, her village, and her country, has enriched my life.  Now I want to visit Botswana because McCall Smith, through Precious's eyes, has made the country come alive for me.  I own all the books in this series and hope McCall Smith will continue to write about these rich and wonderful characters.  Very highly recommended.	2003-09-12

The premise of LOSING MR. NORTH is interesting, but ultimately, I didn't like it as well as her other work.  The reason is, I found it unbelieveable that both women--wife and mistress--enabled Jack North to behave so badly for so long.  This made me impatient with them, and that lessened my enjoyment of the book.  I really need someone to root for when I read and I wasn't in the mood to root for either one of these women.  I could understand any wife forgiving a transgression if the husband seems really sorry and doesn't stray again (especially when there are children involved).  But to go year after year after year pretending not to notice that he simply disappears for periods of time?  To know he's had affairs all through their marriage and to never confront him?  How could I have any sympathy for a woman who lays down on the floor and allows someone to walk over them again and again?  And Rachel?  Let's not even go there.  Why was she so weak that she'd settle for so little?  Oh, well.  An author is not going to please every reader every time.  I'll just have to look forward to Ms. Kagan's next book and hope it compares to her others that I loved.	2003-09-12
US	52231141	R2ZRJH73XN54RE	0525946829	616631756	Quentins	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Disappointing	I have always loved Maeve Binchy, have bought and read all of her books and kept most to share with others.  I was thrilled to see she hadn't retired, although QUENTINS ended up staying on my to-be-read shelf for months before I finally had a chance to pick it up.  When I finally did, I was so disappointed.  Not only is the story uneven, as one reviewer said, it is actually disjointed.  The transitions from one story line to another were jolting and the thin common thread of telling the stories of the people whose lives were changed at Quentins (no apostrophe according to Binchy) wasn't enough to smooth the way, at least not for me.  But the biggest disappointment was in Ella, the main protagonist.  Contrary to what some others have posted, I found Ella totally unsympathetic.  Okay, so she made a bad choice in a man, but if she was really smart--as she's portrayed to be--she'd learn her lesson much sooner than she actually does.  I felt Binchy strung out the \\"I love him and there must be some explanation for his behavior\\" rationale only because she wasn't ready to end the book and not because a mature, intelligent, educated woman like Ella would actually believe the junk that was going through her mind.  I mean, how bad must a man get before a woman like Ella will finally say, \\"Enough!\\"  He lies to her, over and over again, he lies to her father and friends, he cheats her father out of money to her father's ruination -- both personally and professionally -- and then his cohorts threaten Ella, and STILL she is excusing him and thinking there has to be an explanation.  Oh, come on.  Bill Clinton gets caught in a lie and he's vilified.  But this jerk Don lies again and again and we're expected to sympathize with Ella because she is stupid and won't face the truth?  And it's not like she's getting anything out of the relationship.  After all, Don is long gone, living high off the money of others.  She was left to cope with the aftermath and the scandal.  Then Binchy used the same stall technique with the computer.  Any normal woman would have tried again and again to open the darn thing right up front, or she would have turned it over to the authorities immediately.  Again, though, that would have effectively ended the book, which Binchy didn't want to do. I will suspend disbelief easily if an author gives me a good reason to do so, but poor motivation really irritates me.  Excuse me.  Ella may be stupid, but I'm not, and I don't like to be treated as if I am.<br />I lost patience with Binchy about 2/3 of the way through the book, yet I kept reading because I have loved her past work so much and I kept thinking surely she would redeem herself and Ella, but it never happened.  By the time Ella has her epiphany, I was fed up with her.<br />Maybe it really IS time for our beloved Maeve to retire.d the same stall technique with the computer.

Warm, witty, and wise, this is a story that resonated with me, perhaps because I'm half Italian, but mostly because Gaffney is such a terrific writer.  This book made me cry, especially during the touching love scene between Theo and Rose.  And contrary to what the Amazon reviewer thought, I loved the developing relationship between Anna and Mason.  It was nice to see a prickly, very human woman portrayed so realistically, with every single one of her warts showing.  Of course, their fledgling romance didn't have the same depth and richness as Theo and Rose's.  How could it?  They were just beginning to know one another.  Trust and the deep kind of forever love we all want will (one hopes) come later, whereas Theo and Rose have all that history and are nearing the end of their time together.  I highly recommend this book and want to thank the author for a wonderful reading experience.  I'm looking forward to many more Gaffney books.	2002-07-31
US	52231141	RWB6EIQPVL56	0312277342	216391563	Custody	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	Engrossing family drama	If I'd been writing this book, I wouldn't have started with the teaser scene Thayer chose (and it was extremely confusing that the date at the top of the first chapter was an error--it should have read September 2000 rather than August 2000--who did the line edit, anyway?).  After reading that first scene, I didn't want to go back a month and read what led up to it.  I suspect that's why some readers found the beginning slow going.  If Thayer had just started the story earlier and told it chronologically, it would have been a more satisfying read.  Frankly, I didn't want to know what she revealed in that first scene.  I'd have preferred to find out who the man in the custody case was on my own.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Thayer's strength is characterization, and these characters were three-dimensional and compelling.  Ann was particularly fascinating, and Tessa was wonderful.  I was a bit disappointed with the end of the book, though.  Thayer wrapped things up a little too quickly, I felt.  We never did get to see Ann's turnaround.  I just couldn't buy into the idea that a woman so driven and obsessed would so quickly acquiesce to the changes wrought by the judge's decision.  I also wanted to see more of how Tessa felt afterwards.  Still, I would recommend this book and anything else Thayer writes.	2002-07-09

Since that first book, I've managed to get my hands on everything Wall has written, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them all, although HANDSOME WOMEN is still my favorite.  THE GIRLFRIENDS CLUB is a great read, though.  I loved each of the women, and completely understood the strength of their friendship.  Only women bond like this--sharing everything including their deepest fears and insecurities.  My only complaint about Wall is she doesn't write fast enough! &lt;g&gt;	2002-07-09

Certainly her earlier books are much better, yet I have to admit that even when I love one of her books, I rarely remember it once I finish it.  I also never become wholly invested in her characters.  I enjoy them and like reading about them, but they don't haunt me the way characters in other books have.  Still, a Binchy read is always pleasurable and if she keeps writing, I'm sure I'll keep reading.  The thing she does so well is set the stage.  Her rich depiction of Irish life would be reason enough to read her books.  Anything else is a bonus.	2002-07-09

I'll admit it took me a bit longer to get hooked by the story than most books I end up loving, but once I did, I couldn't bear to put it down until I'd finished it.  Gary, Molly, and Suzanne are terrific characters -- completely three dimensional and real.  At first, I heartily disliked Suzanne, but that's because I was only seeing her from Molly's point of view.  Once Suzanne came on stage and we got inside her head, she became someone I understood and sympathized with.  This is, quite simply, a great love story -- not just the love between a man and woman, but about the love shared by sisters, mothers and children, fathers and children -- the whole spectrum of family relationships.

The thing about the book that impressed me the most was the fact it is told entirely from the hero's point of view, yet as a reader, I never missed being in the heroine's head, because Ms. Reavis is such a skillful story teller that you know what Kate is thinking and feeling simply from her dialogue and actions.

I don't agree with the reader who said they hated the foreshadowing technique she used in telling us that in the end, two of the four women would be dead, one by violent means.

It was, in a word, fabulous.  I, too, get turned off by books that are overtly preachy and try to shove religious beliefs of one kind or another down the throat of the reader, but this book wasn't like that at all.  This book made you think.  To me, if a book is highly entertaining, with engaging, believable characters I can root for, and also makes you think, then that book has got something special.  THE PACT was the first book of Picoult's that I have read, and I loved it and recommended it to everyone who would listen.  I then proceeded to buy, beg, or steal copies of all the other books Picoult has written, and KEEPING FAITH is the last of those that I've read.  Along with THE PACT and PLAIN TRUTH, I consider it her best.  She is one very talented writer and I hope she'll keep giving us thoughtful books about difficult subjects.	2001-09-26

From the moment I began reading, I was stunned by this story.  At times, I had to put the book down so I could catch my breath and deal with the emotions evoked by Swick's deceptively simple prose.  Particularly poignant and gripping is Teddy's point of view.  As a reader, I cared so deeply for this boy, it almost hurt to read his thoughts.  As a writer myself, I was in awe of Ms. Swick's talent.  WARNING: keep a box of Kleenex handy.  You'll need it.	2001-01-14

This is the first book of Ms. Whitnell's that I've read, but it won't be the last.  I took it with me on vacation and absolutely devoured it.  I am rarely surprised at endings, but Ms. Whitnell managed to do just that, even as she was spinning a wonderful tale.  I highly recommend it.	2000-10-26

I agree that this is Joy Fielding's best book ever and I've bought and read (and kept) every one she's ever written.  And it's funny I should say this because I was disappointed by the hints from early reviews about the subject matter of this book, but boy oh boy, Fielding can write.  She squeezes every last drop of emotion from each well-chosen word, and the reader feels everything her characters are feeling.  The description of Mattie's MRI almost paralyzed me with fear (I'm soon to have an MRI myself).  I felt her panic as if I were right there with her.  This is a wonderful story, one I highly recommend.  It reinforced what I believe above all else: seize the day, for tomorrow we may die.	2000-09-25

I absolutely and emphatically disagree with the review by the woman who said Mapson repeated things too many times.  As an author myself, I know good writing, and this book is filled with great writing from an extremely gifted writer.  I took it along with me on vacation, and I liked it so much I found myself anxious to get back to the hotel in the afternoons so I could read more.  I especially loved the relationship between Margaret and her son and the way it developed over the course of the story.  I'm now hooked on Ms. Mapson's writing and am looking forward to reading SHADOW RANCH, which is next on my TBR shelf.	2000-09-25

I don't understand the people who have said they thought this book was  slow.  I savored every word and didn't want the book to end.  Mapson's  prose sparkles, and her observations about life, love, and family are witty  and funny and oh so true.  I also loved the world of the Wilder sisters.  The New Mexico setting was wonderfully drawn, and even though I know  nothing about horses, I felt a part of that world and understood the  feelings of the people in it.  This is a wonderful book, the kind I would  heartily recommend to my own sisters and daughters.  I can't wait to read  Ms. Mapson's other books.	2000-08-09
