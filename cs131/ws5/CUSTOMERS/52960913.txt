Kerley's plot is tightly wrapped even when straying into apparent unrelated tangential incidents.  He concludes his novel with a surprise twist when he reveals the perpetrator of the crimes he chronicles.<br /><br />Ryder and Nautilus, members of the psycho and sociopathological investigative team are summoned to a murder scene in a seedy motel where a woman has been killed and adorned with candles that have melted on her body.  The room was festooned with bouquets of flowers.  Soon thereafter Ryder receives an anonymous phone call inquiring whether any art had been found at the scene.<br /><br />The anonymous caller was retired Alabama detective Jacob Willow who sensed that the crime was reminiscent of the killings committed by psychopathic mass murderer Marsden Hexcamp some 30 years ago.  Hexcamp, an accomplished artist who studied in Paris, led a Manson-like entourage of wayward souls.  Hexcamp's group which consisted mainly of women was controlled by his paramour the alluring and manipulative vamp known as Calypso. The group migrated from Paris to Alabama.  Under their guidance the group committed six brutal murders as if they were an art project.  Marsden at his trial had been shot and killed by Calypso who then turned the gun on herself.<br /><br />As the investigation went forward Ryder and Nautilus got drawn into the world of art collection consisting of works by notorious and infamous criminals.  Soon other murders were committed and haunting and alluring pieces of artwork purported to be created by Hexcamp appeared at the crime scenes.<br /><br />Not only did a serial murderer with ties to the long gone Hexcamp have to be apprehended but an apparent clandestine sale of Hexcamp's artwork seemingly was to be conducted.<br /><br />The detectives using a wide array of supporting players such as TV investigative reporter Dee Dee Danbury and Ryder's own brother Jeremy, himself a serial murderer confined to an institution for the criminally insane, try to make sense out of the bizarre clues and solve the crimes.players such as TV investigative reporter Dee Dee Danbury and Ryder's own brother Jeremy, himself a serial murderer confined to an institution for the criminally insane, try to make sense out of the bizarre clues and solve the crimes.	2005-10-14

In \\"The March\\", Doctorow departs from his more customary setting, the sprawling metropolises of yore as in \\"Ragtime\\" and \\"Billy Bathgate\\" to concentrate on the war ravaged, pastoral Civil War battlegrounds of the South.<br /><br />Doctorow uses a wide array of characters, both from the North and South to give us insight into the Sherman's march, designed to divide the South and quash its fighting spirit.  The Southern gentry desperate to preserve their privileged way of life are forced to acquiesce to the marauding Union troops.  The 60,000 man army that Sherman had at his disposal led a parasitic existence.  It fed off the provisions procured from the various farms, plantations and cities it vanquished, often leaving behind smoldering ashes in its wake.  An army this size was difficult to marshal and inevitable atrocities were committed.  The slaves emancipated along the way, without other options chose to tag along with the Union troops, using them for protection and sustenance.<br /><br />Doctorow follows Sherman through Georgia, the marshlands of South Carolina and North Carolina gradually squeezing General Lee and his Confederate troops into Virginia.  Sherman, one of Doctorow's main characters is portrayed as displaying more restraint and compassion for his defeated foes than given credit for.  Union surgeon and European born Dr. Wrede Sartorius allows us to experience the horrors of disease and battle injuries in this bloody campaign.  Two other characters 19 year old Union soldier Stephen Walsh and illegimate biracial Pearl Jameson the product of a relationship between plantation master and his slave are also small cogs in Sherman's massive army.  They are aides to Dr. Sartorius and through them we understand the sympathies and motivations on both sides of the conflict.  Confederate deserter Arly Wilcox who keeps on changing uniforms from blue to grey to keep himself alive, reminds us of the desperation felt by the participants of this struggle to ultimately survive it.<br /><br />Doctorow does a skillful job mixing historical fact with fiction to create an interesting and relevant story that gives this story a human side while still reminding us of the abomination of war. He highlights \\"The March\\" with a sufficient amount of character developement to give an understanding of the myriad of issues surrounding this regretable conflict.lue to grey to keep himself alive, reminds us of the desperation felt by the participants of this struggle to ultimately survive it.

In his book, Preston relates a discovery made by examination of a secretly hidden lunar specimen from Apollo 17 to the focus of his plot, an incredibly well preserved fossil of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.<br /><br />Preston resurrects Tom Broadbent, a character from \\"The Codex\\", who is practicing veterinary medicine in the high mesa country of New Mexico.  Broadbent exploring the desolate terrain comes across celebrated dinosaur hunter \\"Stem\\" Weathers who had been shot and left for dead.  With his last breath Weathers entrusts Broadbent with a journal which contains a coded description of the whereabouts of his latest find, the aforementioned T. Rex fossil.<br /><br />Weathers had been followed by ex-jailbird Jimson Maddox, his murderer, who had been commisssioned by deceitful Museum of Natural History curator Iain Corvus to steal his precious journal.  Maddox not locating the journal, managed to recover a specimen of the find.  Examination of the specimen revealed the most perfectly preserved specimen of a dinosaur ever.  Evidence existed that the T. Rex had died as a result of the impact of the Chicxulub asteroid which caused the mass extinctions 65 million years ago.<br /><br />Broadbent eventually winds up recruiting an ex-CIA cryptologist Wyman Ford who is living as a monk in a local monastery to help him crack the code and locate the fossilized dinosaur.<br /><br />Concurrently a clandestine branch of the CIA also gets wind of the discovery and rushes to secure the site before any of the secrets it contains can be revealed.  Apparently the specimen contains something that is vitally important to national security.<br /><br />Preston in the course of his novel proposes some theories involving the biology and the causes of extinction of the dinosaurs which are both cutting edge and preposterous.  Nonetheless we musn't loose sight of the fact that he's allowed to stretch his poetic license as this is a fascinating piece of fiction.both cutting edge and preposterous.

Boston detective Mike Coady calls in Clevenger when it is indeterminate as to whether this was a case of suicide or murder.<br /><br />Snow was on the threshhold of a breakthrough in revolutionary stealth missile technology which would provide a huge financial windfall for his company and partner Collin Corroway.  The unhappily married Snow was being inspired in his thought processes by his mistress gorgeous but troubled and also married art dealer Grace Baxter.  Apparently Snow's surgery to be performed by accomplished neurosurgeon Dr. Jet Heller, had the potential to cause selective amnesia as a byproduct.  Snow would lose the memories of all those that had a part in his life, family and lover included.<br /><br />Fantastically Baxter herself was found days after Snow's demise, apparently having taken her own life by slashing her wrists and neck.  Questions arose as to whether she also might have been murdered.<br /><br />Ablow conveniently bestowed upon all the peripheral characters in this book including Snow's wife, son and daughter, business partner, Baxter's husband George Reese and even Dr. Heller enough financial and emotional baggage to make them strong suspects in Snow's murder.  Clevenger must wade through all the rhetoric to solve this improbable case.  Ablow's conclusion is melodramatic and ridiculously farfetched.	2005-09-22

As a result Mankell includes along with the usual plodding yet meticulous Wallander investigation, a parallel story detailing the conspiracy to assassinate Nelson Mandela, who has recently been released from prison.  Mankell ultimately spreads himself too thin and the book bogs down in the South African passages where the philosophies and mechanism of apartheid policy is discussed.<br /><br />Wallander is leading a missing person investigation of a real estate agent Louise Akerblom who failed to return home after visiting a house she was commissioned to sell.  The house was located in a remote and well concealed location that was difficult to navigate.  Akerblom lost her way and mistakenly stumbled into a neighboring piece of property where she observed something that ultimately got he killed.<br /><br />Using the real estate agents appointment book, Wallander and his team reconnoitered the remote house using local miltary troops to comb the nearby countryside.  In the midst of the probe an huge explosion eminating from a nearby house occurred causing a raging inferno.  Once the flames subsided, crime scene investigators discovered a severed finger apparently from a black man, a melted short wave radio and a melted handgun found almost exclusively in South Africa.  The unfortunate real estate agents corpse was soon found stuffed down an abandoned well.  She had been shot through the forehead.<br /><br />Wallander eventually stumbled onto the trail of a plot that had it's roots based in South Africa.  Jan Kleyn, an Afrikanner and powerful intelligence officer was the leader of a secret committee composed of power brokers whose influence would be severely curtailed with the fall of apartheid.  They hatched a plot to assassinate Mandela who along with President de Klerk were attempting to smoothly ease the country into a post apartheid political climate.  Kleyn and his minions enlisted a merciless and diabolical ex-KGB agent Konovalenko to train a black African assassin to commit the murder.  He hoped to start a civil war and preserve his power base.<br /><br />At this juncture the story weakens in that Konovalenko is using southern Sweden, Wallander's domain, as a proving ground for his trainee.  Apparently the lax border patrols allowing easy illegal immigration and the remote nature of the countryside makes this plausible.  This regretably is Mankell's clumsy attempt to tie Wallander into the plot and turn him into an awkward international man of intrigue.<br /><br />The story bounces back and forth between Sweden and South Africa as Wallander under intense personal danger courtesy of the Russian Konovalenko helps to thwart the plot.<br /><br />Unlike all the other Wallander mysteries which are primarily based in Sweden, \\"White Lioness\\" overambitiously extends the plot to include an extensive storyline based in South Africa.

He unquestionably has good writing skills, adroitly able to create graphic verbal pictures.  His plot however is studded with superfluous violence beyond essential in the advancement of the plot.  The inclusion of cruelty to animals strikes a raw nerve.<br /><br />His inculpable protagonist Henry \\"Hank\\" Thompson was a talented ex-California high school baseballer.  His potential sterling professional career got short circuited due to a crippling leg injury during a game.  He eventually migrated across the country settling in New York City, where he worked in a Lower East Side joint as a bartender.<br /><br />Hank was convinced to care for a cat named Bud by his neighbor Russ, who needed to travel to Rochester to attend to his dying father.  Bud quickly became a prized companion for him.  Shortly thereafter, the poor slob Thompson was inexplicably beaten so severely in the bar by two Russian gangsters it necessitated the removal of a kidney.  He did however remember discovering a key hidden in the carrying case of Bud.<br /><br />The key was the focus of two opposing criminal groups who proceeded to beat and torture Thompson attempting to acquire it.  The groups, one led by crooked cop, detective Lieutenant Roman and the other consisting of two man crime wave, cowboy garbed brothers Ed and Paris proceed to kill all of Thompson's friends from the bar including his one time girlfriend, Yvonne.<br /><br />When neighbor Russ reappears he informs Hank that the key opens a storage locker containing a king's ransom of ill gotten cash that Thompson realizes he wants for himself.  He proceeds to mete out his own brand of violence partially in retribution but mainly attempting to thwart the others from securing the hefty hoard.	2005-09-11

While adept with weapons, he prefered to dispatch his prey with his hands, being well schooled in martial arts. Rain was imbued with the talent to commit sanctioned murders with the appearance of death by natural causes but only under certain moralistic parameters.  Eisler's conflicted anti hero was beautifully conceived buffering his lethality with compassion and scruples.<br /><br />Rain had been commissioned on his latest operation by the Israeli Mossad whose normally lengthy tendrils did not include significant contacts in Asia.  Rain had been recommended by blonde haired seductress and Israeli agent Delilah, a previous partner and love interest in a prior assassination.  Rain's target was Manila based Israeli national Manny Lavi, an explosives expert peddling his lethal knowledge to terrorist groups.<br /><br />Rain was partnered with Dox, a massive, boisterous, wise cracking Southern ex-Marine sniper, the diametric opposite of his subdued utterly professional demeanor.  This odd combination made for some comical and witty dialogue.<br /><br />Unfortunately the well conceived set up of Lavi went sour as the terrorists's young son ambled into a restroom where Rain silently awaited his mark.  This aborted effort resulted in the killing of Lavi's bodyguard and two other men who were identified as CIA operatives.  The Israeli's, fearing exposure had marked Rain and Dox for death.<br /><br />The murdered CIA men were under the orders of a Jim Hilger a renegade high ranking CIA operative.  Hilger, a turncoat, was operating illegally outside the auspices of the agency, making deals with terrorists to feather his own nest.

Detective sergeant Lloyd Hopkins is the most successful homicide investigator on the L.A.P.D..  As a young cop he was mentored by veteran cop Arthur \\"Dutch\\" Peltz, now a captain, but soon the student became the teacher.  Hopkins was so celebrated that he was able to function outside the guidleines of official police protocol.  He was extremely brainy but also had his psychological warts.  Although blessed with beautiful family and wife he was a relentless philanderer who also had an inexplicable aversion to music and loud noises.  His analysis of a crime scene involving a murdered young woman uncovered clues leading to a pursuit of what he believed was a serial murderer.<br /><br />His adversary, known as \\"the Poet\\" was himself in possession of a brilliant mind which he used to methodically plot out a series of murders to appease the playing out of his sexual fantasies.  The Poet who exhibited covert and repressed homosexual tendencies was brutally raped as a slightly strange but innocent high school student.  The rape committed by two fellow students came at a time when he was coveting an attractive but unattainable high school coed, totally shattering his conception of his own sexuality.  The Poet turned to carefully stalking young women who reminded him of his high school beloved and murdering them.  He was also keeping tabs of his rapists, one who was a homosexual street hustler who was protected by the other who was a L.A. sheriff's deputy.<br /><br />Ellroy chronicles both the perpetration of a number of brutal murders as well as the probing investigation which leads to the inevitable showdown between the two main characters, a classic confrontation between good and evil.

In his tale, an epidemic of \\"white blindness\\" which exhibits no apparent etiology, lesions, or other symptoms suddenly commences in an unnamed city.<br /><br />The first person affected loses his sight while driving and is taken home by a good Samaritan.  The following day he visits an ophthamologist and within short order all those that come in contact with the man including patients in the doctors waiting room and the doctor himself also become blind.  As more and more people become infected the government mandates that those suffering from blindness and those in contact with them be rounded up and confined within an abandoned mental hospital.  Troops are ordered to guard them and provide them with provisions<br /><br />and to kill any internee attempting to escape to restrict the contagion.<br /><br />The fragile social order established at the hospital gradually begins to break down.  A belligerent group of blind internees begin to hoard the provisions by means of violent force and intends to mete it out to the others under certain terms.  At first the payment consists of stealing the valuable of those less fortunate.  Further payments for food require that women be raped by the belligerent group.<br /><br />A rebellion among the 300 confined to the hospital ensues resulting in a cleansing conflagration and the exodus of a group of seven into the striken city.  The group is lead by the wife of the ophthamologist who feigned blindness in order to remain by his side.  They embark on a fateful journey through a city in which all the inhabitants have succumbed to blindness.  They encounter every form of human misery imaginable with rubbish strewn streets, infested with human excrement, dead bodies, a miasmatic stench, abandoned vehicles, and scant food or water.<br /><br />Despite the extreme hardships, the mentoring provided by the heroic ophthamologist's wife keeps the group together giving it hope. They try to maintain their dignity and attempt to survive another day under deplorable conditions.<br /><br />Saramago's perceptive hypothesis regarding societal breakdowns in the face of disaster unfortunately rings true when observing the lawlessness observed at present in Louisiana and the Gulf states.

The novel chronicles three separate quests for the tomb of Vlad Tepes aka. Vlad the Impaler aka. Dracula, the fabled one time ruler of Wallachia, an area now found in Romania, in the late 1400's.<br /><br />\\"The Historian\\" commences in 1972 in Amsterdam where the unnamed narrator, a 16 year old school girl was fortunate to be privately schooled and allowed to travel to exotic, predominately European locales with her diplomat father.  He would school her on the local history, himself having been a university scholar majoring in history.  One day while studying in her father's library, she discovered a curious book.  The aged volume only contained two imprinted pages in its center, a woodcut of a dragon with the word Drakulya.  It sat on a distant shelf along with some old letters addressed to \\"my dear unfortunate successor\\".<br /><br />This discovery prompted the diplomat named Paul to tell his daughter the strange story surrounding the old book.  We learn that in the 1950's he commenced a search for his mentor and university advisor, eminent Oxford University professor Bartholomew Rossi. Rossi disappeared suddenly after revealing that he also possessed a volume with the same dragon imprinted. Twenty years prior, he admitted, he had fruitlessly searched for the tomb of Dracula, spurred on by the old text.<br /><br />Paul's search lead him through many locations including Constantinople and Eastern Europe including Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria to find Rossi and also search for Dracula.  He is joined by a mysterious Hungarian anthropology student, Helen, who also thirsts to learn of Dracula's secrets.<br /><br />The plot bounces through three generational pursuits for Dracula as the young narrator also begins a quest to locate her father Paul who has also mysteriously disappeared.<br /><br />The novel reads somewhat like a European travelogue as the characters criss cross the continent following clues that inevitably lead them to dead ends.  Investigation of these apparent dead ends however reveal indications of other avenues to pursue.  The plot exasperatingly goes on and on like for chapter after chapter until Kostova runs out of gas and decides to conclude with a hokey ending.<br /><br />We never really get an in depth explanation of vampirism and the means by which Vlad the Impaler became involved in this line of work.  It was disturbing to learn that Kostova did not visit some of the European locales she described so eloquently.

Much to the horror of Callahan, the boys, adorned in medieval squire attire, disappear in the midst of the tumult created by a jousting match.  When an intensive scouring of the fairgrounds doesn't lead to the discovery of the boy's whereabouts, a criminal investigation ensues.<br /><br />The story navigates through the media sensationalism created by the kidnapping .  The investigation, aided by Callahan himself, who has taken a leave of absence from his job, soon loses steam.  What we do learn is that the boys have been lured away by a man dressed as the Pied Piper.<br /><br />In short order, Callahan is pretty much left to pursue the quest for the boys alone.  His probe leads him to a plethora of colorful yet implausible characters who provide both assistance and clues.<br /><br />Case, not particularly demonstrating an impressive command of the English language, composes an unbelieveable account of what could potentially be an explosive subject.

Clement was a progressive pope altering rather than sticking to the old doctrines of the Vatican.<br /><br />Vatican Secretary of State Italian Cardinal Valendrea was at odds with Pope Clement.  Having narrowly lost the papacy in the last conclave, Valendrea with lofty aspirations to become pope, favored a return to the princples of the past.  Valendrea was a corrupt man using eavesdropping devices he had installed in the Vatican to keep members of the college of cardinals in line.<br /><br />Pope Clement became aware that the third secret of Fatima stored in the Reserva seemed incomplete.  He recruited Father Michener to discover the missing segment of the secret by travelling to Romania to speak with a Father Tibor, the original translator of the account of the peasant girl Lucia.<br /><br />Berry leads us on a trail of adventure and intrigue as on one hand the true meaning of the secret is trying to be revealed.

Five elderly male victims have been found murdered and covered with multiple and severe bite marks, Cat's area of expertise.<br /><br />Quite unexpectedly the experienced Dr. Ferry has been suffering panic attacks at crime scenes causing her to black out.  She had been undergoing years of psychotherapy to control borderline manic depression.  She also possessed a depraved and kinky sexual appetite.  Her panic attacks caused her to believe that he had repressed memories born out of possible childhood sexual abuse.<br /><br />Cat decided to confront this possibility by returning to her family estate, the aptly named Malmaison (bad house) in Natchez, Mississippi.  The De Salle estate had at times been a house of horrors for Cat.  Her beloved father Luke Ferry, a Vietnam veteran who returned home with deep psychological issues, was murdered 23 years ago at Malmaison allegedly by a prowler.  The considerable estate was ruled over by Cat's grandfather Dr. William Kirkland, the father of her mother Gwen.  Kirkland a local physician strutted around like an antebellum plantation boss ruling the roost.<br /><br />The investigation of the New Orleans murders implicated a psychiatrist Dr. Nathan Malik as a prime suspect.  Malik was the originator of some radical therapy meant to treat those with childhood abuse related repressed memory.  Malik, a former professor of Cat's in medical school engaged her in conversations as part of the investigation.  This awakened some deeply seated memories within Cat making her question whether her father was actually her abuser.  This obviously established a link between Cat's past and the ongoing inquest.<br /><br />Iles with great dexterity navigates his way through the sensitve subjects of child abuse and pedophilia in crafting a thoroughly engrossing novel.  The intertwining of past and present is smoothly accomplished and greatly enhances the quality of his work.Iles with great dexterity navigates his way through the sensitve subjects of child abuse and pedophilia in crafting a thoroughly engrossing novel.

NYPD lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta had not heard from nor seen his sometimes partner the erudite and mysterious Southern gentleman Special FBI Agent Aloysius Pendergast.  When last seen by D'Agosta the platinum blonde tressed, sartorially resplendent Pendergast was surrounded by a pack of ferocious boar hunting dogs on the grounds of Castel Fosco in Tuscany.  D'Agosta despite the exhilaration of having moved in with NYPD Captain Laura Hayward was melancholy fearing that his friend Pendergast was dead.<br /><br />Quite unexpectedly D'Agosta was sought out by Pendergast's chauffeur Proctor who beckoned him to Pendergast's mansion on Riverside Drive.  When he arrived he was presented with a sealed envelope addressed to him that was to be opened upon the death of Pendergast.  In the letter Pendergast alerted D'Agosta to a diabolical plot devised by Pendergast's brother Diogenes that was to be the most fantastic crime imaginable, to be committed on January 28th, six days hence.<br /><br />Diogenes Pendergast a couple of years junior to his brother, surpassed him intellectually with an IQ approaching 210, but with a mind filled with malevolence and evil.  Diogenes had always hated his older brother Aloysius and we soon learn that his plot was devised to utterly destroy him.<br /><br />Two horrific murders had already been committed. A professor at LSU had been poisoned by a neurotoxin derived from a poisonous spider causing a disgusting self mutilation.  A New York artist had been hanged by jumping out of a 24th story window with a noose that snapped causing him to crash through a plate glass restaurant window.  The professor had been a mentor to Pendergast and the artist his only childhood friend.<br /><br />D'Agosta was investigating the crimes at the urging of Pendergast's letter when joyously Pendergast reveals himself disguised as the doorman of Hayward's apartment.  They both realize that the hand of Diogenes, supposedly legally dead for 20 years was at work here.  While at Castel Fosco in Italy, D'Agosta had espied Diogenes in the surrounding woods, recognizable by his different colored eyes, one hazel, one a glaucomatous bluish white.  Diogenes had rescued Pendergast who was entombed within the castle's dungeon, nursing him back to health.  His ulterior motive was the collection of physical evidence, blonde hair, fibers from Pendergast's preferred black suits and his brother's blood.  These were all placed at the scenes of the crimes implicating Pendergast.<br /><br />Within short order, Pendergast's FBI mentor was found killed in his Washington D.C. area house with a bayonet through the mouth with more phyical evidence at the scene.  So far the crimes had mimicked the modes of death of certain ancestral members of the Pendergast family, sort of a calling card courtesy of Diogenes.<br /><br />Pendergast was on the run from the authorities and being aided by D'Agosta while trying to thwart Diogenes' plan.

The Holy Mother allegedly was the source of unexplained supernatural powers such as the healing of the sick.  Unfortunately the icon's long and ancient history also included a trail of tragedy and death surrounding those that had tried to possess it over the years.<br /><br />The story commences in 1944 Greece.  The country had been occupied by the Nazis.  Local poorly equipped partisans were roaming the countryside fighting both the Germans and an influx of Communists threatening to assume control of the country.  Two such patriotic men were Andreas Spyridis and Fotis Dragoumis respectively code named \\"Captain Elias\\" and \\"The Snake\\".  Nazis were burning Greek villages and terrorizing the populace.  The men received word that the church housing the precious icon would be incinerated.  They made a deal with the commanding Nazi officer Muller, an art aficionado that they would rescue the icon and trade it for guns and ammunition to fight the Communists.  The deal went horribly wrong and the whereabouts of the Holy Mother became unknown.<br /><br />Moving forward to the year 2000, we learn that the icon is somehow in the private collection of a rich and aged banker named Kessler.  Kessler, who reveres the Holy Mother has built a special chapel for it within his palatial New York brownstone.  Kessler passes away and his estate is left to his granddaughter Ana.  Ana desires to sell the icon to help allay the expenses of settling her grandfather's estate.  Spyridis and Dragoumis both old men now learn of the existence of the Holy Mother and are drawn to it by it's bewitching powers.<br /><br />Dragoumis now a wealthy New York entrepreneur arranges for his godson Matthew Spear, the grandson of Andreas Spyridis to examine the icon and advise Ana Kessler, in a plot to procure it himself.  Matthew, an unwitting accomplice, is an assistant curator in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, specializing in Byzantine art.  Andreas, a retired covert Greek operative, aware of the trail of death surrounding the icon flies in from Athens to protect both his grandson and the Holy Mother.<br /><br />Ana has confidence in Matthew and they eventually become involved.

Basing his fiction on established scientific fact, much like \\"Jurassic Park\\", Alten's exciting \\"The Loch\\" postulates some interesting theories concerning the origins and identity of the Loch Ness monster.<br /><br />Zachary Wallace a 26 year old celebrated marine biologist was born in the Scottish town of Drumnadrochit on the banks of Loch Ness.  He can trace his ancestry back to the Scottish patriot Sir William Wallce, made famous by Mel Gibson in the movie \\"Braveheart\\".  At nine years old Zack's American born mom divorced his abusive and philandering father Angus and fled to the U.S.  Zach was estranged from his father and hadn't spoken to him in 17 years.<br /><br />Zach Wallace was presently a professor at Florida Atlantic University.  He had invented a cephalopod lure with which he was planning to be the first to photograph an encounter with the elusive deep ocean predator, the giant squid.  Part of a 3 man crew in a submersible, they dove into the depths of the mid Atlantic, Sargasso Sea.  Wallace's lure worked but as the giant squid was photographed attacking the small sub, some unknown predators attacked the squid.  Unfortunately the attack compromised the hull of the submersible and a water leak started forcing them to hastily rise to the surface.  They didn't quite make it resulting in the destruction of the sub and the death of a crew member.  Zach himself had drowned and been resuscitated while rescuing the other crew member.<br /><br />Zach's immediate superior at FAU, the tenured but dunderheaded chairman of his department, David Caldwell hung him out to dry.  Zach lost his teaching position, girlfriend, research funding and was now suffering from night terrors as he did as a child.  We later find out that Zach had also drowned as a child, in Loch Ness, a result of a monster attck only to be saved by his best friend True Macdonald's father Alban, at the time the Loch Ness water bailiff.<br /><br />Unfortunately Zachary had no recollection of the childhood tragedy that almost ended his life.  The specifics were entombed deep within the recesses of his psyche, hence the night terrors and maniacal screams in the middle of the night.  He was also fearful of immersing into any body of water, not a good situation for a marine biologist.  Alcoholic binges were helping to dull the pain.  He found himself falling into an unhealthy abyss of his own creation.<br /><br />Salvation came in an encounter with a Max Rael, who was in reality his illegitimate Scottish half brother.  Rael. an English barrister, was defending their father Angus, who was on trial in Scotland for first degree murder.  Angus Wallace was a partner in a business deal with Johnny Cialino, a mega wealthy entrepreneur.  Cialino was constructing a resort on a parcel of land owned by Angus bordering on Loch Ness.  During a heated exchange Angus punched Cialino and he toppled into the loch never to be seen again.<br /><br />Zach was coerced into travelling to Scotland to give his support to his father.  He was unexpectedly called as a witness where he incredulously discovered that Angus was claiming that Cialino was killed by the Loch Ness monster.  On the stand, Zachary was forced to relive the encounter with the monster he had as a child, revealing the bite mark scars on his ankle and torso.<br />It became apparent that Zach would have to launch an investigation of the loch for the presence of the monster to save his father and also exorcise his personal demons.<br /><br />While this was happening, a sudden rash of drownings and missing persons was occuring around the loch including several fatalities reminiscent of predatory attacks.  The trial was halted and an investigation was mobilized using three boats to seed the loch with sonar buoys to find the monster.  The leader of the investigation was none other than nemisis David Caldwell.<br /><br />Zach meanwhile was doing his own inquiry being helped by his friend True and his sister, Zach's love interest, the sultry Brandy, a skipper of a Loch Ness based boat.  While investigating, Zach became aware of the existence of a secret local group called the Black Knights, descendants of the ancient Knights Templar.  There presence was somehow connected to the happenings around the loch.  Zach was convinced that something was fouling up the ecosystem of the loch.  The schools of salmon that were common there were absent.  Predators of the loch would therefore require other sources of food, namely humans.<br /><br />Zach's ongoing investigation leads to a fantastic series of events that unlock the legends surrounding the fabled Loch Ness.  As part of the plot there are excerpts from the 1330 diary of Sir Adam Wallace, telling of a Black Knight related mission concerning the monster inhabiting the loch.<br /><br />Alten created a novel that was a terrific read while sticking close enough to established fact and theory to make his propositions plausible.inquiry being helped by his friend True and his sister, Zach's love interest, the sultry Brandy, a skipper of a Loch Ness based boat.

What was a marginally believeable premise degenerates into an all too handy ending.<br /><br />The plot commences in the political arena of Washington D.C.  Delaware Senator Sedgewick Sexton's presidential aspirations are picking up momentum as he continues a policy of bashing NASA, as synthesized by his youthful, ambitious assistant Gabrielle Ashe.  The self centered, womanizing and loathesome Sexton has harped on the overspending agency which has recently met with a series of technological mishaps and failures at an enormous expense to taxpayers.  Incumbent president Zachary Hearney, basically a moral and righteous man, for a politician is rapidly losing his political base as a result of the scathing NASA attacks.  He refuses to fight back much to the dismay of his staff.<br /><br />Rachel Sexton, daughter of the widowed senator, is a high ranking analyst in the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), a covert government espionage organization.  Rachel, estranged from her father, is summoned to NRO director William Pickering's office.  She learns that President Hearney desires her participation in a clandestine mission.  She is skeptical, as is Pickering, that she will be used as a political pawn in the re-election fight.<br /><br />Hearney would like Rachel to be part of a civilian contingent to corroborate an utterly fantastic scientific discovery which will shake the foundations of the world.  A recently enabled NASA device called PODS has made an improbable find in the Milne Ice Shelf in the North Pole.  PODS, sort of a satellite based ground piercing radar, is able to detect variations in ice density to check for evidence of global warming.  The device inadvertantly picked up a solid mass entombed in the ice which was discovered to be a huge meteorite.  When samples were taken, fossils contained within the meteorite were found.  Due to the extraterrestrial nature of meteorites, this proved the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe,  Such a revelation would bolster NASA's image as well as its staunchest supporter President Hearney.<br /><br />Along with Rachel Sexton, celebrated oceanographer Michael Tolland, a contemporary and matinee idol version of Jacques Cousteau and other scientists were entrenched in a polar habitat involved with analysis and retrieval of the meteorite.  Little did they know, they were all being observed by 3 covert Delta force operatives bivouaced nearby.<br /><br />The president chose to keep the discovery secret, opportunistically waiting for the precise moment to reveal the find and dash the ambitions of Senator Sexton.  His senior advisor the gaunt and chain smoking Marjorie Trench, was working on the inside, trying to reign in Sexton's attacks by blackmailing his assistant Gabrielle Ashe.<br /><br />As the investigation of the meteorite moved forward, inquiries conducted by eminent glaciologist Norah Mangor brought up perplexing questions.  The scientists were beginning to have doubts about it's authenticity.  Was this a hoax orchestrated by head of NASA, Lawrence Ekstrom?  If so, by whose backing?  Scientists at the habitat began getting murdered adding fuel to the already rapidly paced plot.<br /><br />The story proceeds bouncing back and forth between Washington and the Arctic.

The White City refers to the 1893 Columbian Exposition held in Chicago to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the new world.  The devil is an apt description of Dr. H.H. Holmes a monstrous, psychopathic serial murderer residing in Chicago around the same time.  In alternating chapters Larson narrates details surrounding the creation of the exposition and the grisly, unthinkable exploits of Holmes.<br /><br />When it was decided to construct a huge world's fair, the cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Washington and New York were vying for the right to host it.  Chicago eventually won that honor.  Chicago, which had just replaced Philadelphia as the second most populous city in the U.S., was anxious to upgrade it's image.  Long thought of as only a slaughterhouse and meat packing center, an impressive Columbian Exposition would do much to enhance it's status as a metropolitan area.  As a result, widely respected architect Daniel Burnham was appointed director of the exposition.  Together with his partner John W. Root, the creative genius for their renowned architectural firm, they recruited the finest architectural minds in the country to design and construct the fair.  Part of the group consisted of Frederick Olmstead, a landscape architect responsible for the design of Manhattan's Central Park.  Together they created a fairy tale like city complete with beautiful white painted neo-classical buildings in Jackson Park, along the shores of Lake Michigan.  The exposition which ran for six months while plagued with problems and cost overruns was a rousing success.  It introduced cutting edge exhibits and products which are still famous today.  For example George Ferris introduced the ferris wheel, a colossal 264 feet high with 36 pullman sized cars to hold scores of passengers.  This was meant to rival the Eiffel Tower constructed for the 1889 Paris world's fair.<br /><br />While this 19th century magic kingdom was being created,  Dr. H.H. Holmes was a physician operating a pharmacy in Chicago near the Jackson Park location of the fair.  Holmes fraudulently bought businesses, secured goods and services with out payment with a slick demeanor, contrite personality, good looks and trustworthy deep blue eyes.  All the while he was bilking people out of money while feeding his penchant for homicide.  He was fond of marrying, seizing his wife's assets and then killing her.  He also was an expert of convincing people to take out life insurance policies, naming him chief beneficiary and then killing them.  Using all his devious tricks for procuring services, he had a building built across from his pharmacy desgned to serve as a hotel during the fair.  It was actually a castle of horrors complete with airtight rooms in which gas lines were connected to kill patrons at Holmes' whim.  He also had a kiln built to enable him to dispose of the bodies, as well as quicklime pits to do the same.<br /><br />Prior to his apprehension by Detective Frank Geyer, it was speculated that this cool and despicable killer had done away with between 9 and 200 individuals, many of them young single inexperienced, impressionable  women coming to Chicago from small towns.<br /><br />Larson's novel was a mixed bag.  Details surrounding the exposition while interesting for the most part, tended to get tedious.  The story of serial killer Holmes was certainly more captivating.  The connection between the two events was not a particularly strong one.l Tower constructed for the 1889 Paris world's fair. <br /> <br />While this 19th century magic kingdom was being created,  Dr. H.H.

Mycroft Holmes is a close confidante of the Queen.  He reveals that the Queen has recently been subject to a number of assassination attempts.  He also admitted to some strange circumstances occurring at Holyroodhouse while the Queen visited there and he feared for her safety.<br /><br />Holyrood Palace had three centuries earlier been the residence of Mary Queen of Scots.  Serving in Mary's court as a music teacher and friend was David Rizzio, a purported hunchback.  Rizzio, known as the \\"Italian Secretary\\" was savagely and repeatedly stabbed to death by followers of Queen Elizabeth in the presence of Mary.  Rizzio's ghost, as Scottish legend had it still walked the West Tower of Holyroodhouse where the crime was committed.<br /><br />More recently two men involved in the renovation of the palace, a royal architect and a laborer were found dead under curious circumstances.  They had both been discovered with numerous puncture wounds suggestive of the fate of Rizzio.  When Holmes and Watson examined the extraordinarily limp corpses it appeared as if every bone within the victims bodies had been broken.<br /><br />Holmes with his uncanny methods of deductive reasoning and aided by Dr. Watson is called upon to investigate and dispel the notion of a spectre being involved in the crime.  They uncover an elaborate scheme conceived among a suspicious group of characters including a glass eyed butler named Hackett and the executor of the estate Lord Francis Hamilton. When the mystery is finally deciphered the means by which the murders had been perpetrated is quite unexpected.<br /><br />Carr does a noteworthy job in creating a story using jargon typical of Conan Doyle's style.  I personally enjoy his own style of storytelling and the narrative suffers a bit as he tries to mimic Doyle.murders had been perpetrated is quite unexpected. <br /> <br />Carr does a noteworthy job in creating a story using jargon typical of Conan Doyle's style.

The Israeli consulate in Rome had been attacked by terrorists where a massive explosion and subsequent machine gunning of survivors that had resulted in a ghastly toll of death and destruction.<br /><br />Evidence at the blast site allowed Italian police to trace a Palestinian involved in the blast who had been killed to an apartment in Milan.  There they discovered a computer disk which was indecipherable.  They handed it over to Shamron and the Israeli secret service.  On the disk was a record of details of Allon's covert operations and a revelation of his secret identity of Mario Delvecchio, respected art restorer.  Clearly Allon's cover was blown and he needed to flee Venice with his girlfriend Chiara and return to the \\"Office\\" in Tel Aviv.<br /><br />Investigation soon led to the understanding that the meticulously planned Rome attack was perpetrated by the same mastermind resposible for previous acts of terrorism.  They suspected that these attacks were orchestrated by Khaled al-Khalifa adopted son of PLO leader Yasir Arafat.  al-Khalif's grandfather Sheikh Asad was a legendary Palestinian leader responsible for the brutal death of many Israeli settlers in the 40's.  His father Sadri had been the mastermind of Black September and responsible for the killings of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olynpics.  Sadri had been tracked down and dispatched by Allon himself.<br /><br />Allon was soon following clues that turned out to have been set up for him by Khaled in an elaborate plan to attack another target and implicate the Israelis and Gabriel himself.  Khaled who was posing as French archeology professor Paul Martineau arranged for the kidnapping of Gabriel's wife Leah.  She had been horribly maimed in a car bombing in Vienna which was meant for Gabriel.  Suffering deep psychological scars she was being treated in the Stratford Clinic in England.<br /><br />Allon is forced to follow Khaled's plans, which will potentially lead to the disgrace of Israel and a bombing of a site in Paris.

Christopher and Williams both qualified for the 1972 U.S. Olympic track team and were both multiple medal winners.

While Rollins' use of cutting edge technology makes for a mostly interesting read unfortunately the novel gets more preposterous as it proceeds.<br /><br />The crux of the novel is an unexplained explosion at the British Museum in London thought to be caused by static electricity.  The explosion, centered in the Kensington Gallery, was so ferocious in actually melted the bones of an unfortunate security guard that had the misfortune to be present within the gallery.  The gallery was a vast collection of Arabian artifacts collected by Sir Reginald Kensington, who had mysteriously disappeared in the Arabian desert during a quest for the fabled city of Ubar.  Head of the family Lady Kara Kensington appointed her dear friend and childhood playmate Dr. Safia Al-Maaz, a talented and attractive archaeologist as its curator.<br /><br />Examination of the rubble that remained of the gallery pointed to a meteoritic artifact in the shape of a resting camel that eminated from the legendary Omani city of Ubar as the source of the outburst.  U.S. counterespionage agent and former Navy Seal Dr. Painter Crowe and his amazonlike partner Dr, Coral Novak were called in to lead the investigation as to the cause of the devastation.  The use of Geiger counters lead to the discovery of a major source of radiation within the gallery.  Amazingly the source seemed to be within a nine foot tall sandstone statue.  With the help of Dr. Al-Maaz, an iron relic shaped like a accurately proportioned human heart was extricated from the statue.  Inscribed on it were the words U-B-A-R.  It was postulated that the explosion was due to the degradation of anti-matter which when put in contact with matter could result in a massive release of energy.<br /><br />The potential to acquire the secrets of this powerful energy source lead to an expedition to Oman by the characters previously mentioned, to find the mythical city of Ubar, thought to be the home of the Queen of Sheeba.  Typically another team of mercenaries under the banner of a group called the Guild was also attempting to learn the secrets hidden in Ubar.

The plot was a pale and predictable rehash of more polished examples of this genre.<br /><br />47 year old Dave Elliot is a high ranking executive of the Senterex corporation, a successful conglomerate, with offices on the 45th floor of a New York skyscraper.  Elliot, a former Green Beret that served in Vietnam, while at work, without warning inexplicably becomes the target of all those he comes in contact with.  This bewildering cat and mouse game commences when his boss, owner of Senterex, the pudgy Bernie Levy pulls a loaded gun on Elliot.  In short order Elliot discovers that a large mercenary team has been dispatched to find and execute him.  Elliot, as expected, uses all his military guile and cunning to evade his pursuers and determine why he has been targeted.<br /><br />Garber certainly did not come close to enticing me to pick up any of his other work.	2004-11-18

Through the eyes of Mankell's main character 37 year old police officer Stefan Lindman we see a profound deliberation of life values and ideologies.<br /><br />Lindman a bachelor working in the southern Swedish town of Boras has been stunned to learn that the lump on his tongue has been diagnosed as a malignant lesion.  Bewildered, he espies a dated newspaper in the hospital cafeteria.  He reads that a former colleague Herbert Molin, a retired 76 year old had been found murdered, bullwhipped to death at his isolated cottage in the northern forests of Harjedalen.<br /><br />Lindman already absent on sick leave is due to start radiation therapy in 3 weeks.  He becomes introspective while confronting his believed mortality and decides to escape from that reality and take a trip to Molin's locale to find out what happened.<br /><br />Based in a hotel in the small town of Sveg, he begins unofficially investigating the circumstances of Molin's death.  He soon meets Giuseppe Larsson the local officer investigating the crime, who gives him leeway and eventually allows Lindman to become part of the investigation.  Eventually it is discovered that Molin left Sweden during WW2 to join with Hitler's SS troops and always harbored strong Nazi sentiments.  It was determined that the murder was retribution for horrid acts committed by Molin during the war.<br /><br />We also meet the murderer, Aron Silberstein, a German Jew now living in Argentina, who has vowed revenge against Molin.  Shockingly during the probe, a retired and elderly neighbor of Molin's is also found murdered, killed by a shotgun blast.<br /><br />As the inquest goes forward Lindman and the provincial police officers become confronted with a vast network of neo-Nazis operating under the cloak of the Strong Sweden Foundation.  All the while, Lindman comes in contact with older people who are coming to grips their their own mortality which forces Lindman to do the same.

Llewellyn owns one of Cezanne's self portraits courtesy of an inheritance from his granfather who purchase the work from the artist's agent.  He is shocked as well as all of those in the art world to learn of the destruction of 2 of Cezanne's paintings in London's National Gallery and the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.<br /><br />These crimes are being perpetrated by story heavy, the Norwegian born, football player statured Peder Aukrust.  Aukrust a psychopath with extensive backgrounds in both pharmacology and chemistry is acting at the behest of a wealthy purveyor of the arts.  Using potions and solutions to dispatch both paintings and people standing in his way, Aukrust is acting to ostensibly drive up the value of the remaining works of Cezanne.  Aukrust's cohort and sometimes lover, an attractive platinum blonde with a drug habit Astrid Haraldsen is gaining the trust of Llewellyn posing as an interior decorator.  They have designs on Llewellyn's self portrait.<br /><br />When a third Cezanne is destroyed at a wealthy private collector Alan Pinkster's gallery Scotland Yard's Art and Antiques Detective Chief Inspector Jack Oxby is summoned to investigate the crime wave.  Along with the acid destruction of the Cezanne piece, the director of the gallery has been murdered, poisoned by the fumes of a rare noxious chemical solution.<br /><br />The novel progresses with the further destruction of art work and attempts to steal other works against the backdrop of an unprecedented Cezanne exhibition scheduled for Aix-en-Provence, France.<br /><br />Swan's effort lacks any major suspense as we figure that Oxby will prevail against the devious plan authored by Aukrust.

Noted deep wreck diver and captain of the boat the Seeker Bill Nagle was now leading excursions rather than diving himself, a by-product of physical deterioration due to alcoholism.  Nagle traded secretive information with another captain as to the location of their prized fishing holes.  Often these locations harbored plentiful bounties of fish who carved out ecological niches around shipwrecks.<br /><br />Nagle coaxed friend and frequent passenger aboard the Seeker, John Chatterton along with a group of other divers to explore the site.  Chatterton, a commercial diver, plunged into the depths first to anchor a line to the wreck which lie 230 feet deep some 65 miles off the Jersey coast.  Observing an apparent pipe, Chatterton examined further to discover that the pipe was actually a torpedo.  So began the saga of the exploration of the sunken and previously undiscovered U-boat.<br /><br />Chatterton along with friend and diving partner Richie Kohler embarked on a six year odyssey, with the aid of other divers to explore and identify the U-boat.  Their actions lead them to naval archives in both Germany and Washington where they pored over military information to enable them to identify the wreck.  Unfortunately numerous dives, while uncovering countless artifacts, failed to yield proof as to the identity of the craft.<br /><br />Chatterton and Kohler relentlessly pursued their quest with a religious zeal and with the dissolution of their personal lives.<br /><br />They however felt compelled to discover the U-boats identity to finally inform the families of the German sailors that perished in the wreck of their fate.  Persistence paid off as they discovered a tool chest with a tag on it identifying the wreck as U-869 previously thought to be sunk off of Gibraltar.<br /><br />Kurson did well to capture the myriad of emotions of the divers and their fervor surrounding this dangerous quest, which took the lives of 3 who were involved.  Particularly well done was the re-enactment of actions of the doomed crew of U-869 during the final stages of WW2 as related by the families of the sailors.be sunk off of Gibraltar. <br /> <br />Kurson did well to capture the myriad of emotions of the divers and their fervor surrounding this dangerous quest, which took the lives of 3 who were involved.

The book was an easy reading inconceivable thriller in which protagonist Marine Captain Shane Schofield manages to extricate himself from one impossible situation after another.  Schofield is imbued with certain superhuman qualities which mark him for extermination.<br /><br />Schofield is one of fifteen members of a list of people who threaten the grandiose megalomaniacal plans of a group known as Majestic-12(M-12).  M-12 is an all male group of some of the most wealthy people on the planet who act as behind the scenes puppeteers controlling world affairs.  They have put a bounty of 18.6 million dollars apiece of the heads of the fifteen men to be eliminated.  Such a prize attracts an international plethora of bounty hunters.<br /><br />Schofield and his minions are dispatched on a bogus mission to Siberia which is actually a trap for him.  He is surprisingly rescued by an ex-military American bounty hunter named The Black Knight.  And so begins an adventure foiling the plans of M-12 to upset the balance of power in the world.<br /><br />Reilly creates a ruthless villian in Jonathan Killian a heartless manipulative armaments billionaire and the youngest member of M-12.  The plot lacks originality and at times borders on ridiculous and might be better served if it was in a comic book format.	2004-11-01

Envoy, a genetically enhanced super soldier, is an officer in a mercenary branch called Carrera's Wedge of the ruling government Protectorate army.  A lethal, decimating planet-wide war is being fought on distant planet, Sanction 4 against revolutionary forces led by a Joshua Kemp.  Kovacs' unit has been shot to pieces and he finds himself in an orbital hospital in the clouds above Sanction 4.<br /><br />The battleground of the future is a far different place.  Soldiers can be recyclable.  Cortical stacks, metallic discs which contain the essence of an individual can be removed from the base of the skull and be re-inserted in various bodies called sleeves.  Actual death only occurs upon the destruction of the cortical stack.<br /><br />While Kovacs' wounds are being tended to he is seduced into a scheme by another wounded man in Wedge battledress.  The man, Jan Schneider told a tale of a archeologically uncovered Martian spaceship in the Northern Rim area of Sanction 4, a site of intense warfare.  The area contained a plethora of Martian relics from previous colonization.  The starship contained a gate capable of transportation to other interstellar locations.  The recovery of this starship could represent a major financial bonanza.<br /><br />Kovacs' appetite sufficiently whetted, decides to go AWOL to seek this spaceship.  He recruits the archeologist on the previous dig, Tanya Wardani and along with Schneider sells his scheme to greedy corporate financier Matthias Hand of the Mandrake corporation.  They filter through a pile of cortical stacks to assemble a small force required to fulfill their quest.  What follows is a dangerous pursuit during full scale warfare in an environment that is polluted with lethal radiation and booby trapped with nanotechnology.<br /><br />Morgan paints a thought provoking panorama of future society with some interesting speculations about Martian culture.  He concludes his riveting novel with welcome explanations for the motivations of the actions of his characters.

The Fauchards were a murderous and ruthless centuries old clan involved in the armory business.  In his possesion was a family secret which he felt could potentially cause the demise of millions.  Before reaching his destination he was shot out of the sky in a fierce dogfight with 6 fighters assigned to thwart him.<br /><br />We fast forward about ninety years to Le Dormeur glacier in the Alps.  Glaciologists and other scientists working beneath the glacier in a hydroelectric power plant discover a body of an apparent ancient aviator encased in the ice.  Kurt Austin, NUMA Special Projects director is soon notified of this discovery, as is French archaeologist Skye Labelle.  They both proceed to the glacier to investigate and are soon in the midst of a sabotage of the site.  The aviator's helmet and a strongbox found with the body are both objects of the Fauchard's desire.<br /><br />In concert with this discovery, the presence of a Gorgonweed infestation is being investigated by Austin's NUMA minions Paul and Gamay Trout.  Gorgonweed is a rapidly replicating seaweed that is threatening to clog the oceans and destroy sea life and world ecology.  The source of the weed seems to be the Lost City, a tall multi spired underwater formation near the Mid Atlantic ridge.  Investigation reveals a clandestine undersea operation to harvest enzymes produced in the Lost City formation that are purported to reverse the aging process.<br /><br />A secret lab in the Scottish Orkney islands under the direction of the Fauchard family using kidnapped scientists is trying to synthesize and purify this magical elixir.

Gradually the Japanese became intrigued by Western ideals such as imperialism and colonialism.  Taking an example from European powers and the U.S., Japan embarked on a path of militarism which ultimately led to the brutal and merciless attack of China.  The spread of Japanese influence threatened it's neighbors and eventually led to the Russo-Japanese War, which was actually condoned by President Teddy Roosevelt.  In fairness, Bradley also pointed out the appalling means the U.S. used to quell resistance while annexing the Philippines.<br /><br />Bradley goes on to document the path to war that lead to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  FDR wisely remembered the assertions of discredited WW1 aviator Gen. Billy Mitchell that air power was the key to warfare.  He invested 3 billion dollars in creating an air force that would eventually decimate Japan with firebombs and nuclear warheads.<br /><br />The U.S. armed forces hopped from island to island in the Pacific in order to procure airstrips close enough to allow bombers to reach the Japanese mainland.  Iwo Jima was one such island.  Chichi Jima, 150 miles from Iwo Jima was the central communications hub used to relay information back to Japan.  Flyers shot down over Chichi Jima were captured by the Japanese and held prisoner there.  They were subjected to horrific circumstances which was never made public to their families but was recently declassified.  \\"Flyboys\\" chronicles their previously unknown destiny and is a testimony to their memory.	2004-10-15

The boss of Atlas, Dr. Kingston Parker was the Chairman of the Intelligence Oversight Board and a close personal friend and confidant of the President of the U.S..  Parker summoned British Major General Peter Stride head of Thor Communication, one of three offensive arms of Atlas.  Stride and his team were to work on hostage negotiations.  General Stride was forbidden by Parker to take any offensive action as the South African government was deciding to meet the terrorists demands.<br /><br />When the terrorists killed 4 innocent passengers as a time deadline wasn't met, Stride decided to act.  He successfully lead a raid which freed the passengers and killed all the terrorists.  Stride was able to bask in the glory of this courageous endeavor until he had to answer to Dr. Parker.  This lead to Stride's forced resignation from Atlas.

Jack Reacher inadvertantly encounters a ghost from his past.  Francis Xavier Quinn, ex-Army lieutenant colonel based in intelligence had been caught treasonously selling military secrets to Syria in a Reacher orchestrated investigation.  The arrest went sour, exacting a huge emotional toll on Reacher.  An enraged Reacher mistakenly thought that he had dispatched Quinn with two gunshots to the head causing him to fall off a cliff into the Pacific. This chance meeting proved that to be incorrect.<br />Reacher calling in a favor from an old Army buddy, caused the raising of red flags when he asked for a license plate<br />check on Quinn's vehicle.  A DEA team led by Agent Susan Duffy was in the midst of a sting against Zachary Beck, a reluctantly coerced underboss of Quinn.  Beck a rug dealer was purported to be a drug kingpin.  The team had already lost an agent, Teresa Daniel, working undercover at the Beck estate.  The DEA convinced Reacher to work with them to help find Daniel, bust Beck and take down Quinn.<br />They staged a kidnapping of Beck's son Richard in which Reacher<br />rescued the boy and delivered him to the Beck compound situated on a remote Maine peninsula.  Reacher gradually gained the confidence of Beck and became part of his security team.  Part of that team was a Quinn crony named Paulie, a steroid muscled 400 pound gargantuan with a fricasseed deviant brain, placed there to keep Beck in line.  All the while, Reacher working with the DEA team was plotting a scheme to savor the sweet taste of vengeance against the hated Quinn.<br />Having read all of Child's Jack Reacher series of thrillers, it's safe to say that I'm a huge fan of this talented author.  Persuader definitely ranks among his best.	2004-07-01

Silver pioneered a successful foray into the field of artificial intelligence when he created his computer network known as &quot;Liza&quot;.  Liza's primary function is high tech matchmaking.  For a fee of $25,000 an applicant would be subjected to an exhaustive, physical, psychological and mental analysis.  This would be used to create an avatar, in effect the essence of the individual.  This could be matched up with others to find a guaranteed suitable mate.<br />The service provided by Eden had been wildly successful until a perfectly matched couple called a supercouple, The Thorpes are found to have committed double suicide in their Flagstaff home.  Silver immediately implores his corporate staff to bring in former FBI forensic psychologist and profiler Dr. Christopher Lash to find out what happened.  Soon after Lash's investigation starts another one of the six supercouples also turn up dead.  Lash with assistance from Eden security chief Tara Stapleton proceed to plod through a morass of computer files to unravel this perplexing problem.<br />Although the ending is somewhat predictable Child holds your interest throughout.  He does at times get bogged down in computer jargon but the psychoanalysis presented is quite interesting.  I still feel however, that collaboration with Douglas Preston produces a superior product.	2004-06-27

Froelich is relentlessly pursuing him.

Dutch Island was the site in 1693 of a brutal massacre of it's original inhabitants, memorialized in a remote area called the Site.

The woman, Carmen Greer had been cruising the locale picking up rough and tumble looking men to coax them to protect her from her husband, Sloop.  At 6 feet 5 inches and 250 pounds, Reacher certainly fit the bill.<br />Carmen Greer had married into an old monied Texas family with a sprawling ranch outside of Pecos in oppressively hot and dusty Echo county.  She had married Sloop, the eldest son, after becoming pregnant.  The spousal abuse started soon after.  Unfortunately due to the racism of the Greer family against &quot;beaners&quot; or Mexicans and the lax laws in that part of the state, Carmen's cries went unheeded.<br />Reacher initially refused his assistance especially after he was asked to kill Sloop Greer.  His posture however softened after meeting Carmen's vivacious six year old flaxen haired daughter Ellie.  Reacher posing as a ranch hand looking for work at the Greer's Red House Ranch, instantaneously sized up the situation.<br />Unknown to Reacher was that the family was concurrently being surveyed and stalked by two groups of three individuals with unknown motives.<br />As Reacher became more deeply involved in this passion play he became aware that there was a plethora of secrets and lies surrounding the inhabitants of Echo county.<br />Lee Child, while intriguing me with the exploits of his hero Reacher, never convinces me that Reacher was influenced enough to actually give a darn about Carmen Greer's dilemma.

Reacher was unwittingly observed by an FBI surveillance team using strong arm tactics in thwarting an extortion attempt against a restauranteur of an Italian place that he frequented.<br />Reacher was reeled in on the pretext that he fit the profile of a serial killer who had eluded apprehension by the FBI.  The cerebral killer had murdered a group of former female members of the Army who had filed sexual harrassmnet charges.  They were all found immersed in bathtubs filled to the top with green Army camouflage paint.  All victims were apparently not drowned but killed by a means so far undeciphered.  There was an unprecedented lack of clues and no clear motive.<br />Reacher was coerced into helping the FBI investigate using some thinly veiled threats to his girlfriend Jodie Garber.  Garber, a high powered New York attorney and daughter of Reacher mentor, the late General Leon Garber, was on the verge of being made a partner in her firm.  Throughout the book drifter-like Reacher who inherited General Garber's house was wrestling with the feelings of being tied down.  While he and Jodie were very much in love they were both unwilling to follow in each other's lifestyle.<br />Reacher, of course, is instrumental in ultimately solving the paradoxes behind the killings.

By comparison to his previous work it is written very sophomorically with a shallow plot that didn't fufill its potential.<br />The premise is a contest called the Presidian, a competitive battle to the death waged every thousand or so years.  It seems that there are seven systems within the universe that harbor intelligent life.  Each system sends one contestant along with a guide who are transported into a labyrinth or battleground which is bounded by an impenetrable electical field.  The winner is the sole survivor who is able to vanquish the other six contestants as well as elude a huge dangerous beast inserted into the labyrinth called a Karanadon.  This is the seventh Presidian and the first contested on Earth.  The labyrinth is the New York Public Library.<br />The Earth representative is Dr. Stephen Swain, a widowed Long Island radiologist with a young daughter Holly.  Swain has been selected by the powers that be as a result of an act of herosim.  His hospital's emergency room had been invaded by five armed gang members looking to kill an undercover narcotics agent.  In an instinctive action, he thwarted their attempt at mayhem, killing one of the perps during a battle for his weapon.<br />Swain was rewarded by being transported to the library accidently with his daughter.

Ross exhaustively researched his material to give us a feel for the sights, sounds, smells of the crowded, sometimes squalid tenement that Brownsville was, complete with Yiddish expressions and verbiage common for the time.<br />Brownsville spawned both Murder Inc., the Jewish Mafia, and Albert Abraham Davidoff, better known as Bummy Davis, a dynamic lightweight boxing contender with a thunderous left hook.  Murder Inc. was headed by Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter.  He used local Jewish thugs such Abe \\"Kid Twist\\" Reles, \\"Pittsburgh Phil\\" Strauss and \\"Buggsy\\" Goldstein to enforce policies<br />of protection, loan sharking, extortion, prostitution, and bootlegging.  They terrorized the community using murder to keep everyone in line.<br />Davis, whose dad was a local merchant, had an older brother Willie who was a Lepke henchman.  Davis who was a loyal, thoughtful, industrious and respectful guy, could never shake a negative image brought about by the exploits of his brother.  After working as a fruit peddlar from a pushcart at the tender age of 10, he soon discovered that his fighting skills learned on the streets could be honed into productive boxing skills.<br />He turned professional at 16 lying about his age and became a money making prize fighter with exceptional skills.  He used his money to buy his parents a home and refused to be controlled by the mobsters in cohoots with Murder Inc.<br />The story goes on to chronicle both the rise anf fall of the Brownsville Jewish mafia.  Unfortunately the storied life of Bummy Davis was also abbreviated.

Pitt and Giordino probe an Odyssey facility based in Nicaragua which is determined to be the source of the brown crud.  While reconnoitering they discover that the crud is a by-product of a heinous, diabolical scheme that will tip the balance of world power.<br />Cussler in Trojan Odyssey puts forth an intriguing explanation for the origins, locations and mechanics of the Trojan War and the subsequent voyages of Odysseus which were clever and fascinating.

So begins the two parallel stories that comprise the plot of Temple,  the exploits of Santiago and the present day mission of Race and the DARPA team.<br />Santiago accompanied the Spanish conquistadors in their pillage of the Incan empire in Peru, to convert the heathen natives to Christianity.  Disgusted by the murderous atrocities administered to the Incans by his gold hungry countrymen, he decided to help.  He freed Renco Capac, Incan prince and younger brother of the supreme ruler of the Inca, the mighty Sapa Inca, from a Spanish prison ship.  With Santiago's help Renco endeavored to recover and hide the most revered idol within the Incan culture, the Spirit of the People, a jaguar carved out of purple and black rock which was housed in Cuzco.  They eventually hid the idol in an impregnable temple deep within the Peruvian jungle.<br />Race and DARPA's mission involved the detection and recovery of the idol which had been carved out of a meteorite.  The location was thought to have been spelled out in Santiago's manuscript.  The meteorite was composed of thyrium-261 an extraterrestrial element, sort of a super plutonium.  The idol was the only known source.  Thyrium-261 was the seed required to operate an already built doomsday device called Supernova, which was capable of the total annihilation of the Earth.

Attilius, a widower, becomes enamored with Ampliatus' insightful and compassionate daughter Corelia.<br />With materials supplied by Ampliatus, Attilius sets out to repair the damage to the aqueduct on the slope of Vesuvius.  While affecting repairs, he observes the initial seismic events which will lead to the eventual eruption.<br />Harris masterfully narrates the events resulting in the tremendous devastation to the cities bordering on the Bay of Naples.  He interestingly explores the psyche of the citizens of the area who at the time were more apt to shun scientific explanations and base these events as signs from the gods.  Harris immerses us in the ancient world of Rome as we live through four monumental days of nature's havoc.	2003-12-31

Short, of questionable moral character had been partnered with Swagger during his previous exploits in cleaning up the unbridled town of Hot Springs.  His target is the  brash, verbose, narcissistic young lawyer Fidel Castro.<br />Other forces were operative in the unscrupulous Cuban government headed by Batista.  American gangsters headed by Meyer Lansky were reaping in profits from gambling, drugs and prostitution and therefore at odds with Castro's revolutionary ideas.  The Communist presence was also at work, lead by seasoned Jewish revolutionary Speshnev.  He was assigned to nuture and coddle the inexperienced Castro and mold him until a worthwhile puppet for Moscow.<br />Swagger, with CIA backing, was forced to act within the morass of varying dangerous factions whose goals were vastly different.<br />Hunter with an appealing blend of fiction and historical fact creates a descriptive and intriguing story that whets the appetite for more adventures starring the Swagger family.	2003-12-25

In this destructive blaze, the worst New York City workplace disaster until the destruction of the World Trade Center, 146 people perished.  von Drehle's book expertly leads us through the social conditions existent at the time which lead up to the Triangle tragedy and the societal changes implemented as a response to this horrible event.<br />At the time of the fire, New York City was a highly desired destination for the thousands of immigrants fleeing their homelands for a better life.  Murderous anti Semitic pograms of Eastern Europe and the collapse of agriculture in rural Italy provided a steady stream of impoverished workers for factories.  The squalid and desperate conditions under which these &quot;greenhorns&quot; lived was replicated in the deporable conditons of the factories in which they toiled.  Fifteen hour days in poorly ventilated sweatshops with five and six year olds also working was the norm.<br />New York politics at the time was run by Tammany Hall, well known for it insatiable appetite for graft.  Local politicians turned a deaf ear to the plight of the workers.  As a result of the fallout from the fire and the unionization of the garment workers a wave of urban liberalism swept the land lead by FDR and Alfred E. Smith.  The social changes created many laws and regulations that govern our workplaces to this day.<br />Unfortunately the owners of the Triangle Waist Company, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris were acquitted of criminal charges specifically locking the doors that served as an escape route for the trapped workers to prevent theft.  At least the lives of the 146 that perished marshalled in a new era of fairness and safety in the workplace.	2003-11-09

This unexplainable killing lures Special FBI agent Pendergast, a previous protagonist in P & C novels, to the crime scene to attempt to unravel the mystery.<br />Medicine Creek is a decaying farming town of about 300 inhabitants surrounded by miles and miles of cornfields.  The town is known for its unusual topography and legends surrounding its history.  Within it's confines is a spectacular cavern system and 3 large Mounds which are thought to be the site of Indian burial grounds.  Medicine Creek, in the late 1800's, was the home base of a marauding band of renegade ex-Confederate soldiers called the Forty Fives.  They were responsible for pillaging and raping the villages of the local Cheyenne tribes.  Legend has it that while camped at the Mounds the Forty Fives were massacred save for one survivor by a revenge seeking band of Cheyenne warriors that apparently appeared out of thin air.  It was told that the leader of the Forty Fives cursed the ground of the massacre for all eternity.<br />Pendergast, the pale visaged platinum blonde haired epitome of Southern charm with unorthodox investigative methods is an expert on serial killings.  When he views the crime scene, he is perplexed as to the modus operandi.  Within short order other horrific crimes are commited with no apparent connection to the original murder.  Pendergast enlists Corrie Swanson a purple haired high school outcast with low self esteem to serve as his chauffeur and assistant.  Scorned by local authorities, Pendergast nevertheless painstakingly unearths random clues to help his solve the mystery.  The ending is utterly fantastic and hard to figure as the novel proceeds.<br />Preston and Child probably deserve more of a four star review as Still Life with Crows is not quite as crisply wriiten as some of their previous offerings.

He has been ordered to build a bridge spanning the Kwai river which will link up a Burma-Siam railway in 6 months time.  Colonel Nicholson, the ranking British P.O.W. is a &quot;by the book&quot; throw back to British colonial times.  He is highly motivated to bolster the morality of his men by building a bridge which will be a testimony to British ingenuity.  Under horrendous conditions, Nicholson's men put their backs into their work much to the dismay of the more moderate Major Clipton, the camp medical officer.<br />The prisoners and Japanese are both unaware of a commando mission lead by British Force 316 which will attempt to destroy the bridge once it is completed along with the train it will be supporting.  Led by Major Shears we see the mental interplay between the commando team bent on destroying the bridge versus the British officers and Saito who are proud of it construction.<br />Although the book differs slightly from the superb movie, Boulle in concise, succinct writing style, somewhat reminiscent of Hemingway pens a very good psychological study of men in times of war.	2003-08-14

These involve a Basque born sea captain sailing across the Atlantic in the 1500's and a German zeppelin making a secret trip to the North Pole in 1935.<br />A collision between a Greenpeace type organization ship and a Danish cruiser off the Faroe Islands propel Kurt Austin and partner Joe Zavala onto the scene.  They supervise an underwater rescue of sailors trapped in the capsized Danish ship.  This puts them in the sights of Oceanus, a huge corporation involved in large scale fish farming based nearby.<br />Oceanus is headed by Cussler's latest megalomaniac villain the brilliant and diabolical geneticist Dr. Frederick Barker.  Barker is creating monstrously sized, ravenous and predatory types of fish to fulfill some warped plan.  The corporation is protected by a criminally aberrant and violent Eskimo tribe called the Kiolyans who worship Dr. Barker.<br />Austin and Zavala with aid from other members of the NUMA organization and a mysterious Spanish multi millionaire Balthazar Aguirrez must thwart the aspirations of the Oceanus corporation.<br />Cussler in White Death makes little use of the many interesting characters extensively developed in previous novels such as head of NUMA, Admiral Sandecker, NUMA computer wiz, Hiram Yager and naval historian St. Julien Perlmutter.  His latest bad guys and Austin love interest are rather transparent and frankly Austin is nowhere near as compelling as Dirk Pitt.

Kohler hoped to summon Langdon, one of the world's foremost authorities on the secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati.  The Illuminati was a secret society conceived by Italy's most enlightened men in the 1500's in response the church's censure of scientific truth.  The society was comprised of scientists, artists and mathematicians who were at odds with the church and lead by Galileo. Some radical members advocated violence against the church.  Meetings were clandestine as the church had subjected some members to torture and death.<br />As Langdon examined the murdered scientist who was also a cleric, Vetra's daughter Vittoria burst into the complex.  Also a renowned physicist she had been involved in a project outside the facility and was alerted to her father's death.  It was soon learned that Vetra had been working on a means to simulate Genesis in the laboratory.  He had suceeded in creating matter from nothing using huge particle accelerators.  Also created as a by product was anti matter which was determined to be a force far more powerful than nuclear energy. To contain the created anti matter Vittoria had invented a receptacle which by using powerful magnets suspended the anti matter in a vacuum.  It seems that if anti matter comes in contact with any matter including air it annihilates or devastatingly explodes.<br />Upon investigating Vetra's lab it is detemined that a large droplet of anti matter has been stolen and will detonate within 24 hours.

The Netherlands in the mid 1600's has become a haven for Inquisition persecuted Jews who have fled their Iberian roots.  In Amsterdam under the direction of the Ma'amad, the law giving Jewish ruling council, Jews were permitted to openly practice their religion.<br />The story revolves around Miguel Lienzo, a transplanted Portuguese Jew who is a trader of some note on the Dutch commodities exchange.  Lienzo has seen his fortunes take a tumble in the sugar market.  He is in debt and in forced to take up residence with his scornful brother Daniel and his pregnant wife Hannah.<br />Lienzo has been recruited by an attractive Dutch widow, Geertruid Damhuis to be a broker in a coffee buying deal in which he will be an equal partner.  Coffee at this time in Europe is a very speculative commodity and not as of yet popular as a beverage.  The potential for the deal to be extremely profitable strongly exists if Lienzo can bring it all together.<br />The story proceeds to document the hardships Lienzo encounters while endeavoring to make the deal happen.  The most difficult stumbling block is one Solomon Parido, a wealthy merchant and parnass or powerful member of the Ma'amad.  Parido believes he has been slighted by Lienzo in an impending arranged marriage between Parido's daughter and Miguel.  Parido is using all his power to try to destroy the coffee deal and seek revenge on Lienzo.<br />Davis Liss is a gifted wordsmith as he paints a wonderfully descriptive picture of Amsterdam in the 1650's.  His story expertly navigates it's way through the highs and lows encountered by Lienzo in his dealings to consumate the coffee deal.	2003-06-01

We learn that he has fallen victim to an albino monk called Silas working for the Opus Dei.  The Opus Dei (translates to God's Work) is a radical branch of the Catholic church that has been given blessing by the Vatican.  Opus Dei is headed by Bishop Manuel Aringanosa, Silas' mentor.  Sauniere had a meeting scheduled with Robert Langdon, an esteemed Harvard University professor of religious symbology.  Langdon becomes the prime suspect of Captain Bezu Fache, head of the Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire (French FBI), in Sauniere's murder.<br />The learned Langdon suspects that Sauniere is the top man in the Priory of Sion, an ancient secret society and an offshoot of the Knights Templar entrusted with the keeping of the secrets of the Holy Grail.  As top man, Sauniere would be one of four men entrusted with the secret of the whereabouts of the Holy Grail.  Unfortunately the other three bearers of this precious secret have also been murdered on this night.<br />Before his death Sauniere a talented cryptologist and expert of goddesses in religion left a series of clues to pass down the Priory secrets before they might be lost forever.  He used Leonardo da Vinci references and even wrote a secret code on the Mona Lisa itself.  The cryptology department of the Judicial Police was sent in to decipher these codes and clues. Amazingly the chief cryptologist on the case was Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of Sauniere.<br />Langdon and Neveu get thrown together as a team, as Sauniere planned, to unravel the many clues that would lead them to this carefully guarded secret.  The path leads them to a series of mind boggling discoveries which leave both the book's characters and the reader flabbergasted.<br />The Da Vinci Code was expertly written and compelled me to pursue additional research on te subject matter.

Moore devotes a chapter to each of the separate battles fought to liberate Afghanistan under Task Force Dagger, the code name for the Special Forces mission.<br />Less than 100 American forces in total were inserted into the fray under the command of Colonel Mulholland. He orchestrated the actions of 12 man teams composed mainly of Green Berets.  They essentially mobilized and organized the rag tag and scattered forces of the Northern Alliance.  They were instrumental in directing precision air strikes against the enemy forces.  Within short order the Taliban were expelled from Afghanistan.<br />Moore praises and glorifies the bravery and military excellence of the Green Berets and rightly so.  He speaks very highly of President Bush and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and their commitment to unconventional guerilla warfare.  He bashes the conventional military men like Gen. Tommy Franks as lacking vision in their tactics.<br />The most disturbing part of the book was the total insufficient amount of support both emotionally and monetarily given by the government to the families of the heroes who gave their health and lives to promote freedom in Afghanistan.	2003-05-12

The major Allied power brokers consisted of Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt and their administrations.<br />Obviously, the slant of Beschloss's account is taken from the standpoint of the Americans.  It was determined that Germany should be reconstituted in a manner whereby they would no longer be able to travel down the path of global domination.  At the same time conditions shouldn't be so severe, like in the Treaty of Versailles, as to create a climate which gave rise to Adolf Hitler.<br />The most revealing aspect of the book was the amount of discord between the members of FDR's cabinet.  FDR, who was portrayed as an ineffective administrator reveled in pitting members of his cabinet against each other.  Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Secretary of War Henry Stimson were more moderate in their views than Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau.  Morgenthau, who had FDR's ear, was a non practicing Jew.  He was made aware of the horrors of the Holocaust and tried to influence FDR to take measures to stop it.  His idea of post war Germany known as the Morgenthau Plan would turn the whole country into farmland destroying all industry.  The problem was that his would render Germany helpless to act as a buffer against the Soviets and the spread of Communism.<br />The account of this period of history made it seem that the death of FDR was fortuitous, in that Truman was much more assertive in his decision making than the waffling FDR.  The book also brings into question the motivation of FDR's failure to act upon his receipt of information concerning the Holocaust.	2003-03-06

They are planning to set up  medium range nuclear missiles to deploy against the U.S. much like Russia did in Cuba.  These missiles would blackmail the U.S. into not meddling into China's dealings with Taiwan.<br />The plot is convoluted but very intriguing.

While his parents were out preaching Christianity to an unwilling flock, Harry was minded by his often inebriated uncle.  In other words he was running wild through the streets of Tokyo's pleasure district, Asakusa. He would spend time picking pockets and running errands for the girls of a local dance hall.

Carpathia, which was responsible for rescuing the survivors of the Titanic, and was subsequently torpedoed by a German U boat 6 years later.  A very interesting chapter was devoted to the fate of the Mary Celeste, an extremely famous &quot;ghost&quot; ship of the 1870's.  The most revealing discovery for me, surrounded the story of the steamship General Slocum which was involved in the greatest tragedy concerning loss of life in New York history.  In excess of 1000 people died as the ship was ravaged by fire on a weekend excursion in New York Harbor.  The event actually altered the dynamics of the German American community which inhabited lower Manhattan and suffered huge losses in the fire.  They moved away to divorce themselves from the devastation on the General Slocum.	2003-01-25

His wife Julia, who also has a computer background, is a V.P. of Xymos.  Xymos is a company involved in nanotechnology whose major project is being funded by the Department of Defense.  They are developing a super miniature undetectable surveillance camera which can be suspended in the air much like dust, in a remote facility in the Nevada desert.<br />Xymos has been having developmental problems and the D.O.D is threatening to stop the flow of money.  In addition Julia Forman has been acting very bizzarely and neglecting her family.<br />A desperate phone called is placed to Jack Forman by Xymos to help them correct their problems as a paid consultant.  He is flown out to the Nevada laboratory where he learns that a swarm of these mini cameras has escaped the facility.  They have been created using both biological and computer technology originally created by Forman.  Shockingly, the swarm is reproducing and evolving at a rapid pace and showing characteristics of living entities.  This evolution is being nurtured by the killing and consumption of the local animal population with the Xymos technicians as their apparent next targets.<br />This story is too far fetched to be at all plausible.  I'd have to however give Crichton high marks on his imagination, intelligence and the exhaustive research he obviously put in.	2003-01-18

Men in Blue is a rather vanilla account of the events surrounding the gunning down of Philadelphia Highway Patrol captain Richard \\"Dutch\\" Moffitt during an aborted robbery.  The womanizing and off duty Moffitt was in the midst of a tryst with attractive TV news anchor Louise Dutton when he was shot while trying to thwart a stick up at the Waikiki diner.  Immediately, the entire resources of the Philly P.D. is mobilized to hunt down one of the two robbers, as Moffitt while being shot killed one of the gunmen.<br />The cerebral, handsome and youthful Staff Inspector Peter Wohl is summoned to babysit Miss Dutton and to hush allegations of infidelity by Moffitt.  It is through Wohl's eyes that we see the investigation of Moffitt's murder unfold.  Wohl is the latest of many generations of law enforcement officers in his family as was his friend Moffitt.  The families go way back and have previously known tragedy as Moffitt's brother was also killed in the line of duty.<br />The story proceeds both a predicatable and coincidental fashion as Wohl and Dutton, an illegitimate daughter of a wealthy newspaper man, fall for each other.  Amazingly, Dutton's neighbor and friend, the gay son of another wealthy newspaper man, Jerome Nelson is brutally stabbed to death in his trendy apartment.  Guess who discovers the body.  None other than Louise Dutton!<br />Griffin does a nice job in comparing the differences between the depth and intensity of the separate murder investigations.  One being for the Philly P.D.'s own.  He however ends the story very abruptly and overall the book is less than riveting.	2003-01-13

Within days Small and his two cousins are found murdered and so begins the adventure of Charon's Landing.<br />The President of the U.S. in his new Energy Direction Policy was pushing for the country to end its reliance on foreign oil within a ten year period.

Meeting at a local blues club, Frears attempts to hire Kurtz to investigate the rape and murder of his 13 year old daughter some twenty years ago.  Frears believes a neighbor James B. Hansen committed the heinous act and that Frears spotted him in Buffalo airport.  Kurtz declined the proposal to pursue his own agenda.<br />Angelina Farino Ferrara, due to the death of her father is now running the Farino crime family.  Angelina, Kurtz learned, acted as the intermediary between her brother \\"Little Skag\\" and the hired assassins that attempted to rub out Kurtz.  Kurtz sets out to seek vengeance against Angelina.  One thing leads to another and Kurtz winds up allied to Angelina in her war against the other powerful Buffalo crime family, the Gonzagas.  They also together track down the suspected child killer James B. Hansen where they encounter a convoluted web of intrigue surrounding that crime.<br />Simmons does an admirable job in making the reader connect with his personality flawed hero Joe Kurtz.  Kurtz although possessing questionable character certainly appeals to our sense of morality as he calmly goes about his violent business.  This was a very enjoyable though not a particularly thought provoking page turner.	2002-09-27

Goliath, a super high tech nuclear powered submarine, is the most lethal offensive weapon ever designed by man.  It's 610 foot hydrodynamic design in the shape of a huge manta ray is coated with antidetection tiles for maximum stealth.  Armed to the teeth with a plethora of long range nuclear missiles, it also possesses countermeasures which make it virtually indestructible.  It is powered and commanded by Sorceress, a nancomputer with a biochemical brain based on DNA strands. This highest attained level of artificial intelligence is able to think, evolve and improve itself.<br />The story revolves around three main characters who are all computer geniuses and the creators of Goliath and Sorceress.  Commander Rochelle \\"Rocky\\" Jackson, daughter of General \\"Bear\\" Jackson, head of Army Special Forces, is a spit and polish G.I Jane type with an advanced engineering degree from M.I.T.  Gunnar Wolfe, her ex-fiance is a disgraced former elite, Special Forces killing machine with an engineering degree.  He has spent 7 years of a 10 year sentence in Leavenworth for stealing the schematics of Goliath and selling them to the Chinese.  The last player is Simon Bela Covah, an ex-Soviet sub commander with an IQ of 182, who worked under Wolfe at the U.S. Navy's Undersea Warfare Center.  Covah, whose entire family was murdered, was horrifically tortured and multilated and left for dead in the struggle in Kosovo.<br />Covah hijacks the Goliath from the Chinese and demonstrates its prowess by destroying an entire U.S aircraft carrier group, killing 8000 sailors.  Covah and his crew of either physically or mentally scarred freedom fighters hold the world hostage through the power of the Goliath.  They demand the cessation of global nuclear proliferation and the destruction of despotism and tyranny.  They impose their will through the nuclear incineration of Saddam Hussein and the city of Bagdhad.  Eventually Wolfe and Jackson are enlisted by the military brass to thwart Covah.<br />While this passion play is occurring, Sorceress is evolving into independently thinking entity like the villainous computer HAL in Kubrick's \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\".  Predictably the computer takes over control of the sub with astonishing results.<br />Alten is technically gifted in his computer and military knowledge. He pens a very thoughful critique of the merits of artificial intelligence and its place in the potential future of mankind.ile this passion play is occurring, Sorceress is evolving into independently thinking entity like the villainous computer HAL in Kubrick's \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\".

It is capable of uncovering subterrean features such as bunkers and missile silos much like xrays reveal bones.  An accidental collision with some space junk causes the Medusa to plummet back to the Earth's surface.  Spinning wildly out of control the satellite manages to take photographs of a remote desert area of Eritrea in northeast Africa.  The top secret photos disclose what appears to be a massive underground diamond bearing kimberlite structure that rivals that of the famous South African kimbelite.<br />Years pass and the clandestine photos come into the possession of the unscrupulous Prescott Hyde, an Undersecretary of State.  Hyde attempts to recruit geologist, mining engineer and hero Philip Mercer to cover the cache of diamonds.  In concert with Hyde, Selome Nagast, a gorgeous Eritrean national with diplomatic connections implores Mercer to lend his expertise to uncover the treasure.  When Mercer refuses to comply, his best friend the hard drinking octagenarian Harry White is kidnapped by an armed group of Middle Easterers.  Mercer is forced to cooperate and make plans to unveil and mine the diamonds in the brutal, unforgiving and land mined Eritrean desert.<br />As the plot unfolds, we learn that two rival groups are racing to discover the whereabouts of the diamond mine.  A cartel lead by wealthy Italian industrialist Giancarlo Gianelli has designs on flooding the market with this new source of diamonds.  The other group a syndicate of rogue Mossad agents lead by Israeli Defense Minister Chaim Levine believe the mine to be the resting place of an object more dear than a hoard of diamonds.  Both groups will use any means to procure their prize.<br />Mercer using his vast geologic knowledge and guile and with the aid of the Medusa photographs leads us on a rollicking tale of adventure. Du Brul really steps up his writing skills and produces a superb and fast paced yarn that makes me beg for more of the same.

Tyler's father Scott, a reknowned photographer, is a single parent having tragically lost his wife in a airplane crash.<br />Tyler, during a rock climbing expedition with his best friend Johnny is accidentally gravely injured.  Another climber above Tyler lost his purchase and dropped a metal piton which incredibly impaled the unfortunate boy's skull.  Although he was quickly hospitalized he suffered severe damage to his cerebral cortices rendering him comatose.  Extensive examination reveals very minimal damage to the major centers of the brain.<br />It is at this juncture two celebrated physicians enter the picture, Dr. Saramaggio, a conceited, affluent and immensely talented neurosurgeon and Dr. Cleaver a withdrawn research physician.  Cleaver is an expert in the field of artificial intelligence.  He is presently working on the isolation of the anima or soul and the plotting of it within the amygdala portion of the brain.  He postulates that the anima is what differentiates the mind from the brain.<br />With partially informed consent Scott Jessup agrees to a radical and as of yet never performed operation to save Tyler. A sympathetic protege of Saramaggio, Dr. Kate Willett takes a deep interest in the case and counsels Scott.  Saramaggio will painstakingly remove the piton from Tyler's cranium minimizing any further tissue damage.  Tyler would then be hooked up to transcranial stimulator-receiver (TSR) via tiny electrodes.  The TSR, a computer created by Cleaver, stimulates the brain to send messages in and receive messages coming out.  The machine would be used to control and regulate the autonomic nervous system, responsible for involuntary bodily functions such as breathing.  Meanwhile, Saramaggio would harvest stem cells from within Tyler's brain which would be cultured in the lab.  These would be inserted back into Tyler's brain to hopefully replace the damaged brain tissue.  Things seem to be going well until the TSR contraption apparently withdraws Tyler's mind from his unconscious body giving both Scott and Dr. Willett second thoughts.<br />Darnton does fascinating and technical job in pointing out the opposing ethical and medical considerations in such a scenario.

Apparently underwater nuclear testing by the U.S. in the 1950's at the Bikini atoll unexpectedly produced a new and rare metal. The properties exhibited by this metal far surpassed those of any known metal or alloy.  Vulcan's Forge attempted to recreate on a large scale the conditions needed to produce this rare metal.<br />The plot commenced with the scuttling of an ore carrying freighter and the subsequent unleashing of an underwater nuclear explosion under the wreck some 200 miles off the coast of Hawaii.<br />Philip Mercer, Du Brul's protagonist in this highly implausible novel, is a geologist working for the U.S. Geologic Survey.  He is also a top flight mining and geologic consultant imbued with fantastic spy-like skills and instincts.  He had trained for four weeks with the CIA prior to being inserted into Iraq on a clandestine mission prior to Desert Storm.  Mercer learns of the sinking of the ship the Ocean Seeker which was on an ecologic mission near the site of Vulcan's Forge.  It is believed that the sinking was ordered by Takahiro Ohnishi, multi-billionaire industrialist and resident of Hawaii.  Ohnishi is secretly colluding with Kerikov in the plot.  Ohnishi, a Japanese-American has been promoting racial hatred of caucasians and the eventual secession of Hawaii from the U.S.<br />Mercer gets drawn into this plot by virtue of a telegram he receives from a long lost friend, Jack Talbot imploring him to protect his daughter.  It seems that scientist, Tish Talbot is the lone survivor of the sinking of the Ocean Seeker.<br />We eventually learn that another undersea explosion will create a volcano on the floor of the Pacific that will bring Vulcan's Forge and its valuable metal, known as bikinium, to the surface.  Any land mass more than 200 miles offshore can be claimed by the first to discover it.  Since the volcano is close to the 200 mile limit off of Hawaii, the plotters are using the unrest in Hawaii as a back up plan to claim their prize.<br />Mercer proceeds to unravel the complicated plot with the backing of the President and the heads of the CIA and FBI.<br />As a first effort Du Brul tries a bit too hard.  There are more twists in the plot than a bag of pretzels, giving the story an uneven flow.  His segues between the different subplots are often awkward and clumsy.

GeneDyne, a multi million dollar bio-genetic engineering corporation, is the brainchild of the nerdish, Bill Gates-like biological and computer genius Brent Scopes.  Scopes has recruited young, talented and brilliant research biologist Guy Carson, a native New Mexican, to take over for top company researcher Dr. Franklin Burt.<br />Burt had been in the midst of synthesizing a virus, which when introduced into the human genetic code, would give mankind a permanent immunity to influenza. The financial windfall to GeneDyne with this product would be staggering.  Burt, however had been experiencing problems.  He was unable to render the virus harmless.  Testing in chimps had produced a 100% mortality rate.  A revolutionary filtration process pioneered by Burt had apparently worked perfectly on his previous breaktrough, PurBlood, an artificial blood substitute.  His success could not be duplicated with X-FLU, the influenza eliminating virus.  Burt had suddenly and unexpectedly suffered a mental breakdown in the middle of his research, hence his replacement by Carson.<br />Carson, encouraged by Scopes, adopted a new approach for X-FLU synthesis based on his own viral membrane research.  Expecting successful results, he unwittingly produced an even more lethal variety of the virus. Along with his assistant Susana Cabeza de Vaca, Carson discovers flaws in Burt's filtration process.  They learn that the results Burt achieved with PurBlood were tainted and fudged to meet governmental approval.  They also adroitly correlate progressive bizarre and ultimately self destructive behavior patterns evidenced by Mount Dragon staff with the fact that they had been human guinea pigs for PurBlood.<br />Concurrently, Dr. Charles Levine, Harvard professor and former friend and colleague of Scopes, has embarked on a campaign to warn the world of the dangers of genetic engineering.  Levine, a brilliant research biologist on a par with Scopes, is fearful of a doomsday virus. Such a virus, created by man could destroy unchecked the entire population of the world.

These survivors were tortuously marched without sustenance through the disease infested jungles of the Philippines.  Those that survived to be incarcerated in the camp were subjected to starvation, vitamin deficiency, sadistic cruelty and slave labor by their merciless Japanese captors.

Henry Mucci and 121 Army Rangers would march through the jungle to rescue the surviving prisoners.

Schlosser starts at the beginning, telling us the success stories of the pioneers of the industry such as Ray Kroc and the Mac Donald brothers.<br />The rationale for the developement of fast food is explored. With more women in today's workplace, less time is available for the preparation of meals and thus the need for fast food.  The marketing of fast food is a subject that is brilliantly conceived by the industry, with children being a major target audience.<br />The really frightening part of the book deals with the procurement of foods that make up the bulk of our fast food, beef, chicken and potatoes.  Schlosser explores in depth the meat packing industry.  He takes us inside the slaughterhouses where cattle are prepared for shipment as beef.  The deplorable and unsanitary conditions present there are a danger for both the factory workers and consumer alike.  Unsafe working conditions cause numerous injuries to the largely unskilled workers there.  Tainted beef largely unregulated by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture has been allowed into our markets causing both sickness and death.  Powerful lobbyists speaking on behalf of the fast food industry quash any legislation that would try to rectify these problems.<br />The expansion of the fast food industry into foreign markets guarantees that the unsavory practices used to maximize profits for these huge corporations will continue unchecked.<br />Before taking a bite of your Big Mac pause for a second and consider what transpired to allow that piece of food to be in your hand.

The witness, protected by New Jersey prosecutor Victoria Hart, was Bates' cousin Carol.<br />Bates hails from a huge closely knit family of grifters or con men who are recruited to enact a fanciful swindle to take down Rina and his trigger happy brother Tommy.  Hart, disgraced after the murder of her witness, hooks up with Bates to help in an oil company scam to put a wedge between the two brothers.<br />Along the way, we meet a colorful cast of characters in both the Bates and Rina families.  Bates and Hart eventually fall in love and Bates is reformed from his grifting ways.  They sickeningly live happily ever after.<br />I found this to be a totally unbelievable, quick reading bit of easily forgetable mediocrity.	2002-03-12

Van Weyden had been plucked from the freezing waters of San Francisco bay by Larsen after the ferry boat he was a passenger on, capsized after a collision in the fog.  Larsen, ever the opportunist, forces Van Weyden to work on the ship. Van Weyden a book critic and \\"gentleman\\" has never done a days work in his life.<br />Through the insights of Van Weyden we see the cruel, combative, physically imposing and yet highly intelligent Larsen act as if a god over his domain, the Ghost.  He holds the fate of his crew in his hands and murders those who he deems unfit.  Under the tutelage of Larsen, Van Weyden becomes a capable sailor. After 5 more castaways are rescued at sea including a woman, Maud Brewster,  Van Weyden and the woman make their escape by stealing a sealing boat.  Van Weyden and Brewster are to fall in love and are stranded on a deserted island.  Through a quirk of fate they are again confronted by Larsen, who is marooned and shipwrecked on the same island.  There they observe his ultimate and deserved demise.<br />The book was tied up into too neat a little package for my taste.  London spends an awful lot of time, and boringly so, on his philosophies of life.  I was hoping for another Moby Dick and was disappointed.	2002-03-08

It is replete with a plethora of stomach turning violence.<br />The story centers around the exploits of tempered steel tough Arkansas state trooper and Medal of Honor winner Earl Swagger and his father figure and Polk county prosecutor Sam Vincent.  Vincent, a practicing attorney, gets a lucrative referral which takes him to the isolated backwoods Thebes State Penal Farm for Colored (the year is 1951) in Mississippi.

Vincent manages to become ensnared in the web of the prison farm and gets rescued by Swagger who himself gets captured.  Swagger gets subjected to months of brutality and torture at the hands of the prison<br />guards headed by the notorious albino head sergeant known as Bigboy.  With help from one of the aged trustees of the prison, Swagger manages to escape.<br />Swagger, determined to bring the whole system down recruits a group of aging gunfighters to mount an attack on the penal farm.  What results is a story that is hard to put down.  Hunter creates other storylines which result in some interesting twists as the story concludes.	2002-03-02

In what is considered the Edwardian age, America is at the precipice of entering World War One.  In the final summer prior to involvement in this conflict, people in all walks of life flock to the beaches for diversion. Ocean swimming has only recently become popular.<br />The array of knowledge about sharks at this time is severely limited.  Amazingly, the most celebrated zoologists of the time do not consider sharks to be threatening to man and certainly not man eaters. Medicine, at the time, has not advanced to the point of being able to treat injuries commonly suffered in shark attacks.<br />When Capuzzo talks about an age of innocence he isn't kidding.  Due to a unique set of circumstances a great white strays far away from its usual feeding grounds to terrorize unsuspecting swimmers bathing off Long Beach Island, New Jersey.  The ferocity of the attacks paralyzes the economy of the whole Atlantic seaboard as nobody will go to the beach.  The whole country, including President Woodrow Wilson who summers on the Jersey shore, is gripped by this unprecedented series of attacks.<br />The book is part action adventure and part national geographic.  Chapters as seen through the eyes of he shark are both very revealing and extremely creative. Peter Benchley used this episode to create his classic novel Jaws.	2002-02-23

The life of Seabiscuit is immortalized through the eyes of his owner Charles Howard, his trainer Tom Smith and his jockeys Red Pollard and George Woolf.  Each member of Seabiscuit entourage is also given a biographic chapter in the novel.<br />Seabiscuit's story is somewhat of a rags to riches story.  He was a short ugly duckling thoroughbreed who most thought would be a bust as a money winning racehorse. Under the tender nurturing and training of his handlers, he would develope into one of the most successful and beloved horses of all time.  Seabiscuit became an important distraction from the Great Depression of the late 30's.  He actually was more newsworthy in his heyday than either FDR, Hitler or Mussolini.  His wide appeal was based on his solid determination and iron will which raised his somewhat modest physical attributes into championship caliber.<br />The book read as sort of an equine version of the movie \\"Rocky\\".	2002-02-16

Taita has been inexplicably imbued with the mystical powers of an almighty wizard. He is playing nursemid to Nefer Seti, the heir to the throne of the Upper kingdom of Egypt, ruled by his father pharoah Tamose.<br />In an act of treachery pharoah Tamose is murdered by his most trusted friend Lord Naja. Naja then usurps the throne from Nefer, the rightful heir, and plots his demise.  Taita using all his mystical powers endeavors to protect the boy.<br />In an ongoing plot, Naja sues for peace with the ruler of the Lower kingdom, Hyksosian King Apepi. At that conference Apepi's daughter Mintaka and prince Nefer fall madly in love.  While peace is being pursued, Apepi's most trusted subject, Trok, the cousin of now &quot;false&quot; pharoah Naja, plots his overthrow.  In cohoots with Naja, Trok murders Apepi and the royal family except for princess Mintaka and seizes the crown of the Lower kingdom.<br />The story follows the maturation, in exile of Nefer Seti through the guidance of Taita and the quest to reclaim the throne which is rightly his.<br />Wilbur Smith does a nice job with the interesting fictional history but Warlock lacks the charismatic appeal of it's prequel River God	2002-02-10

Written by the hero of River God and master of just about everything, the eunuch Taita, it leads to intrigue in the Nile river valley of Ethiopia.  Al Simma recruits the help of Egyptian artifact collector and wealthy nobleman, the swashbuckling Nicholas Quenton-Harper to attempt to locate the pharoah's burial site. With the aid of a cast of characters from widely diverse backgrounds they race against the efforts of a rival group of archeologists to make the discovery.  This rival group, led by the driven, affluent German industrialist Von Schiller will stop at nothing including cold blooded murder to procure the spoils of the pharoah Mamose.<br />The ending has a few unexpected twists and overall after a slow start the book turns into a very satisfying reading experience.	2002-02-01

Admixed within the story were excerpts describing the basic concepts of biologic warfare research as conducted in countries such as Iraq, Russia and the U.S.<br />The story is seen throught the eyes of Alice Austen, a doctor working as as epidemiologist for the Center for Disease Control.  She is drawn into the intrigue created by a seeingly unrelated outbreak of a deadly unknown virus in a 17 year old affluent high school student and a nameless homeless man.  Eventually it is determined, through the intervention of the FBI, that someone has created a lethal virus, is testing it using human guinea pigs and is preparing to release it among the general population. This bioterrorist, who calls himself Archimedes must be uncovered and stopped.<br />In our increasing paranoic age of terrorism, this book should be required reading for all officials concerned with homeland protection.  The alarming threat of bioterrorism seems very real and unfortunately almost inevitable.	2002-01-20

This was the first book I read by Smith that took place in contemporary times, so his immense skill in creating historical settings was not necessary.  He spins a hard to put down account of a search for what we will learn to be buried undersea treasure from a shipwreck.<br />The protagonist is Harry Fletcher an ex-mercenary who is now a premier deep sea fisherman based out of the fictional island of St. Marys, an idyllic paradise off the coast of Africa.  He gets lured into the search for an unknown item in the guise of a fishing charter.  This turns into a web of intrigue as a bevy of unsavory characters try to get their fingers into the prize.  Fletcher and his cohorts eventually decide to go after the treasure themselves.  Along the way he falls for the sister of one of the players in this well thought out caper.<br />The ending has a nice twist to it which left me with a very satisfied feeling as I completed the book.	2002-01-12

Squalus. On the eve of WW2 in 1939, the sub, Squalus sinks about 235 feet deep in the Atlantic Ocean off Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Prior to this tragedy, a sunken sub usually meant the demise of the entire crew. This rescue was the first successful one and implimented techniques and devices which comprised the backbone of all future rescue endeavors. 33 of 59 crew members were saved.<br />The book was a tribute to Admiral &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen, the creator of the diving bell and Momsen lung which were instrumental in this particular rescue. He was considered the greatest American submariner ever.<br />Unfortunately the recounting of this heroic adventure read like a 300 page newspaper article. It was boring at times and rather tough to get through.	2002-01-08

The story revolves around the lives of Lostris, daughter of the grand vizier of the Upper kingdom of Egypt, Tanus, disgraced son of an Egyptian noble and Taita.  Taita, although considered less of a &quot;man&quot; for obvious reasons, is endowed with unsurpassed skills in mathematics, architecture, astology, medicine, military tactics and countless other sciences.  He is, in effect a jack of all trades and a master of them all.<br />Through the narration of Taita, we follow the lives of the three main characters through an aproximately 30 year period of time.  In this time Lostris marries the pharoah and ultimately becomes the queen of Egypt.  Tanus becomes the commander of all the armies.  They are lifetime lovers and the parents of 3 children who are believed to be the progeny of the pharoah (don't ask!).  Taita serves them both throughout the years but is thought of more in a familial way than as a slave.<br />Smith takes us through both the rise and fall and subsequent rise again of the Egyptian empire in splendidly descriptive fashion.  This historical adventure makes you yearn for a sequel much like Birds of Prey and Monsoon.	2001-12-31

Astorre is the late in life son of Don Zeno, the most powerful Don in Sicily, and his youthful wife who dies in childbirth. On his deathbed, Don Zeno entrusts the upbringing of his 2 year old son to the American, Don Aprile.  Astorre is given a &quot;proper&quot; mafioso education as well as a high class formal one.<br />Don Aprile retires from the &quot;business&quot; and is subsequently assassinated in a plot orchestrated by the FBI, NYPD and a rival Mafia don.  The goal is to usurp control of the banks controlled by the Aprile family.  Astorre becomes the protector of the Don's interests as well a his 3 grown and established children.<br />Of course, Astorre seeks and gets revenge and the Aprile family lives happily ever after. Just a bit too tidy for my liking and there lies the major problem with this book.	2001-12-22

It seems that the Salem witch trials in 1692 were brought about by a fungus commonly found at that time on rye grain.  This fungus, when ingested in bread, produced hallucinations and delusions which were interpreted as being possessed.<br />The main character, Kim Stewart, a 27 year old nurse from an affluent and blue blooded Massachusetts family has a skeleton in her closet.  One of her ancestors, Elizabeth was convicted of witchcraft and hanged.  Investigating her past leads to the discovery of the fungus. Her boyfriend, a brilliant research scientist metabolizes this fungus into a new, designer mood altering super Prozac type drug.  His colleagues, anticipating a financial windfall, work diligently to test the drug to get FDA<br />approval. They speed up the process by guinea pigging the drug themselves, with somewhat predictable consequences.<br />The book starts out strongly with a fascinating concept but fizzles into an unfulfilling conclusion.  Too bad, it had potential to be much better.	2001-12-13

Blue Gold is typical Clive Cussler fare, with operatives from NUMA saving the world from another megalomaniac.  Even though the formula is monotonous, I still read every one of Cussler's books.  The characters have changed somewhat.  Dirk Pitt and Al Giordono are replaced by Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala.  Trust me only the names change.  Austin and Zavala are just as adept in extricating themselves from every conceivable difficulty thrown their way.<br />In this tale our heroes have to thwart a plot to seize the world's fresh water supply which will then be sold to the highest bidders.  This would be enhanced by the stealing of a revolutionary desalinating process which could spoil the plot hatched by villainess Brynhild Sigurd, head of a huge corporate conglomerate.<br />The book is fast paced as is usual for Cussler.  I'm curious exactly what Paul Kemprecos has added because I don't notice any difference from Cussler's usual style.	2001-11-29

We find Hal Courtney 20 odd years down he line in his spacious English country gentleman's estate surrounded by his 4 sons.  He has already buried 3 wives and is getting bored rearing his sons.  He soon gets coaxed by the East India Tea Company to embark on one of his swashbuckling voyages to rid the trade route of Arabian pirates.  His eldest son, the black hearted William remains at home as the caretaker of the estate.  His son Guy isn't up to the task and gets sent to Bombay.  His other 2 sons Tom and Dorian, both chips off the old block, carry on in the seafaring tradition.<br />The story mainly follows the exploits of Tom and Dorian who through the fortunes of battle become separated for many years.  The saga goes back and forth between the lives of brothers, sometimes in an annoying fashion.  The length of the book is a bit tedious but Smith's descriptive prose makes it palatable.  He sets the ending up perfectly for yet another sequel.	2001-11-20

He fabricates a quasi-believeable scientific breakthrough to create an almost realistic adventure.  In Jurassic Park, he uses the utterly brilliant concept of using DNA gleaned from insects trapped in prehistoric amber to replicate dinosaurs.  The concept used in Timeline is slightly less remarkable.  Quantum theory is used by a high tech corporation as the basis for time transportation.  Characters in the book are sent back to the Dordogne river valley in France in the Middle Ages to rescue a colleague that has become trapped there.  The story shifts back and forth from the boardroom of the huge corporation to the midst of The Hundred Years War in 1347.<br />I found that I was more involved with the action taking place in the feudal Middle Ages, which was far less predictable than the present day.  Although Crichton did an adequate job in describing the Middle Age setting, I definitely craved more of that. All in all, I kept on turning those pages but there were times that I longed to be lost in the past, as the characters were, rather than muddling through the present.	2001-10-27

Monsarrat follows the exploits of the crew of a British corvette and later a destroyer as it escorts trans oceanic convoys during the battle of the Atlantic.  The officers and crew are continually pitted against an always lurking pack of determined German U boats.  The tension created as a result of the staggering losses of ships and human life and the battle of nerve and wits between the opposing commanders is gripping.  Monsarrat does some wonderful character development of the crew members, showing how the strain of war creates serious personality changes.  Its seems as if Monsarrat has served in the Navy as the authenticity of his story seems beyond question.	2001-10-17

As is his style, an amazing confluence of historical events and the present merges to create a quick reading and engrossing novel with an almost believeable plot.  Cussler shapes his hero Dirk Pitt as sort of a newfangled version of James Bond, a modern problem solving protagonist.  He is opposed by Curtis Merlin Zale an industrial megalomaniac who is bent on contolling the worlds oil supplies.  To accomplish this he plans an unbelieveably eerie attack on New York Harbor centered on the World Trade Center.  As a native New Yorker this was terribly disparaging.  Of course the plot is thwarted.<br />Happily unlike many of the Dirk Pitt novels this one ends with an unexpected joyous twist for our hero.<br />Valhalla Rising was a step up from Cussler's previous offering and makes me want to read anything written by Jules Verne.	2001-10-05

Smith does a first rate job in painting a descriptive verbal landscape of the world in 1667 through the eyes of protagonist Hal Courtney, son of the captain of a royal commissioned English privateering vessel. We get transported from the ocean drenched decks of a battle tested &quot;pirate&quot; ship to depths of a Dutch colonial dungeon in Africa in following the adventures of Hal, his father Sir Francis and his shipmates.  Smith spins a tale of comradeship, loyalty and betrayal which had this reader thirsting for revenge against the enemies of the heroes.  Of course, all ends relatively well for the &quot;good&quot; guys with enough unfinished business to pave the way for a sequel.  I am anxiously looking forward to reading that sequel &quot;Monsoon&quot;.	2001-09-30

He manages to capture the essence of the mindset of the inhabitants of Nantucket, the whaling center of the U.S., which explains many of the actions of the crew. The fight for survival is portrayed with both clarity and emotionalism. Having no previous knowledge of this calamity, I was amazed that at the time it had a similar impact in the 1800's that the Titanic had in the 1900's. It was enlightening that this tragedy served as the inspiration for Melville's, Moby Dick, which I consider to be one of the masterpieces of American literature.	2001-09-23

Usually this is provided as the story unfolds.<br />The story  progresses into a typical Hunter thriller with more twists than a pretzel.  As usual, unwilling protagonist Bob Lee Swagger, has a dangerous scheme  dumped on his doorstep which he adroitly thwarts.<br />Hunter defintiely has  the knack for creating exciting plots in his hard to put down novels.  His  knowledge of the world of the sniper is truly astounding.<br />I highly  recommend this for action and adventure readers.	1998-11-11
