Do not let the title mislead you. <br /> <br />This is fiction. The book is written as a diary, in first person, as if Merlin himself was telling his story. The narrative is fluid, splashed with ancient english words, the most famous wizard of all times tells his story. While it is very close to what we all know and love from Merlin, there are of course, some diferences from legend to legend. <br /> <br />Besides being quite a quick and entertaining read, what truly makes this book shine are the ilustrations. If you love fantasy art this is for you. You will be transported by the drawings and paintings in this great book. <br /> <br />Hard cover and thick, all color paper make this book a keeper for all fantasy lovers.	2005-09-09

This book is not a deep, scholar-like study of myths and legends, it is an easy to read compilation of classics from early northern Europe. From Irish to Welsh, to Celtic myths, the stories presented here are retold by the author in a modern way, and I feel no omission has been made, from a non scholar point of view.<br />I'm sure there are deeper and more intricate books about Celtic Mythology, but this one is a must for starters or fans alike.<br />Included are many, many tales about kings, castles, quests and magic, and the author remains true to the spirit of the time, and you'll be surprised to read the original telling of the classic Cinderella.<br />In all, a very good read, (More than 600 pages, dozens of tales) for kids or adults alike, and a good introduction to Celtic Mythology.	2004-12-21

This hardcover, coffee table book is great from front cover to back cover. Carefully binded and in Matte black cover with color printings, The Stratocaster Chronicles is a must for guitar fans, strat players or not.<br />There is not one of the 264 pages that doesn't include a great picture, from the first strats, to rare prototypes, to newer models, custom shops and stars' models.<br />The book includes many excerpts with key memebers of the Fender factory in 1950's, including the man himself, Leo Fender, along with Bill Carson, Freddie Tavares and many others. The author dove into his archives to present the most accurate history of the Strat to date, from its inception, the two horns, the origin of the famous peghead and all the details of the most loved guitar. <br />Rare pictures from the early 50's tell the tale along with narration from the author and dozens of interviews. This book includes an Audio CD with fragments of interviews with Leo Fender, plus 50 different sounds the Strat has become famous for, in the styles from player like Eric Clapton, Hendrix, Knopfler and Malmsteen, you can even learn to make your Strat sound like a Koto, from Japan!<br />In all, just the pictures in this book are worth the price, the history, interviews and Cd are a great plus. Celebrate the 50th anniversary of the instrument that shaped modern music with this great book.	2004-05-10

Needless to say, after reading the book in one day, I noticed that my knowledge on Lucas had not improved.<br />Very few is added to what fans already know (that he almost got killed in a car crash, he struggled to make American Graffitti, and Star Wars was a surprise success to him)<br />This book lacks the depth a figure of Lucas' status should be given. I wanted to know personal data as family members, how was the relationship with his father (rumored by many to be represented in Darth Vader) if he was the geek in school or not, etc, etc.<br />Good for non-fans or persons that know almost nothing about him, pass if you have read or learnt something about this modern myth-maker.	2003-08-01

Filled with information about Computer acquired RSI, the authors go through every major detail about the illness: Posture, genetics, diet, work habits, ergonomic workstations, you name it, they have researched a lot.<br />Then book features a direct and easy language, nice B/W illustrations, and many sites for research all over the Web, which you can use to further your knowledge about RSI.<br />This book doesn't feature too many excersices, it is mainly informative, and the authors just give a few pointers and encourage the reader to find professional help.<br />Now the negative: There are a couple of things I did find somwhat odd in this book. After describing and defining RSI, and documenting how missunderstood this illness is by the medical community, they  jump into their major recommendation: Go to a doctor and get a proffessional opinion. Well then you have to find a doctor versed in RSI, and not one that only want to operate, like they did on the many cases described in the book.<br />Second, I actually found a little offensive. They are quick to dissmiss any form of alternative therapy such as herbs, taking vitamn B6, homeophaty or even acupuncture regarding them as 'new agey' and not worth trying. To the mainstream or regular medical community, massages and physcal therapy like the authors suggest are also alternative. I have personally combined exercises with acupuncture and healthy eating habits plus suplemments, with good results.<br />In all, a great resource book, not many excersices but a lot of info, and we all know the best tool against any illness is information.<br />Buy it along with Conquering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome : And Other Repetitive Strain Injuries by Sharon J.

From upper-body to hand-fingers, this book (Comprised of mostly full-page illustrations) helps you relieve the symptons of your RSI. I can't say I don't have any pain anymore, but I can say it has greatly reduced, and improving.<BR>There is little text in this book, dealing mostly with how you should do the repetitions and how to avoid further injury, then it is right ot the action with the diagrams and instructions for every exercise.<BR>If you have an RSI try this book, and also check for your posture while working, seating, and standing.

It helps you with many doubts that arise during the process of building a guitar, plus details the construction of 3 major projects: A bolt on guitar, a set neck guitar, and a bass. Following every project step by step, you get coverage of mostly all processes involved in any kind of electric guitar building.<BR>In my own project I had a strong doubt about neck angle, since I was using a TOM bridge, but this book helped me clear all that.<br />Filled with black and white illustrations all along, the book deals with designing a body, cutting it, binding it, building a neck from scratch, gluing or bolting it and dealing with electronics, to finally achieving high gloss finish. There is also a very useful set of templates for pickup routing of guitars and basses. In all, with this book and supported by the guitar maker's forums on the net, I was able to build my first guitar. Check my website for pics of my project.<BR>Peace	2003-04-28

On the good side, the pictures presented here are amazing. From a walk on Central Park in full makeup! circa. 1975, to a session of facials the band got in a beauty parlor, the rare pics are worth the price of the book alone. You will read this book in an hour and certainly will enjoy the dozens of pictures Waring Abbott shot from 1974 to 1981. I would have liked for the leaders of the band and writers of the book to comment more on each individual photo and also invite Ace and Peter to give their two cents on the shots. Anyway, a good book on Kiss at a not so high price. Great for  any fan of the band.	2003-01-23

Mr. Stanley dismissed this book as not being the definitive Kiss book, and although it may not be the ultimate Kiss book, it is by far one of the best - if not the best - written today.<BR>This book chronicles more than 5 years of research by the authors who stormed the Internet, chat clubs, fan forums, libraries, ect. All to get the latest info on the more than 1800 concerts that Kiss has played to date. Written in very easy english, the book is more like a reference guide to all the concerts the band has played, but under most dates you will find little text add-ons that are delightful. The authors interviewed tour managers, roadies, pyro techs, wardrobe ladies, managers, producers, and muscicians who tell great stories from the early and not so early days. To top it up, there's more than 200 amazing shots of the band, some we have seen, some rather obscure.<BR>In all, a great book.	2003-01-06

What kind of strings did Eric Clapton use in the early 70's? How Eddie Van Halen learned to play? Suffer no more, this grat book answers all the questions any guitar lover could think of. From Jimi Hendrix to Stevie Ray; from Duanne Eddie to Alan Holdsworth, this 40 masters of the guitar reveal some of their secrets, techniques, tips or simply talk about life in this great compilation of interviews conducted by top journalists from Guitar Player Magazine. Most of the interviews range from 1970 to the early 90's. The book has a very nice white cover, with black and white texts and a picture of every player interviewed. Of course one would love color pics, but then the price would go up. My only complaint with this book is that it is too short and features none of the blues greats (They mention why in the intro, though) and maybe that some interviews could seem far too old for the average modern player. You can consider Conversations... as a bible of the modern electric guitar (though Segovia and other acoustic players are featured). If you are into Blues-Rock-Jazz or play guitar, you can't let this one pass.	2002-10-01

While it leaves out key spoiler scenes it does recreate the feel and sequences of the movie quite well. The dialogs are of course adapted to the medium and the drawings are quite simple and straightforward, yet beautiful. One of the flaws of this graphic novel is that it does not add much to the plot or the pciture itself, while it could have been used to tell the unseen part of the movie, it just recreates it the most faithfully and accurately possible. I think it's more a souvenir or collectible than a real comic book. Worth getting if you collect SW stuff.	2002-08-28

From early inceptions to the new Special Editions (1997). The book leaves off just weeks to the release of Episode I but has some chilling insight when refering to the future of the Saga. For instance, when they comment on the burp jokes on Return of the Jedi the authors write \\"whats next? Bodily function humor? Maybe we'll see that on the next movies\\" Well, they got it right, didn't they. This books makes a complete recollection of all things Star wars since from 1977 to 1997. From an extensive detail of all the books so far published, to the comics and radio dramas. Especially amusing is the sections 50 reasons why Return of the Jedi sucks. Never had I laughed so hard at any form of Star Wars humor. You will see ROTJ with different eyes after reading this. If you are a SW fans, don't let this one pass.	2002-07-17

Based on astronomy and archeology, with some hints at astrology and metaphysic knowledge, Mr Hancock and Mr Bauval take us trhough a journey in time, trying to get back to the origins of the always mystical and eningmatic Pyramids and Sphinx. Although the title lays on the cat-headed monument, they indeed spent a lot of time and pages of this book dealing with the pyramids and their main details. <br />Through this book you will be able to learn about the constant attempts they and many other researchers have made to go deeper in the study of the Sphinx, in concrete, to try and find the secret chambers that lie beneath the monument, and how all of those attemps have been met with a burocratical &quot;no&quot; from the different administrators of the site.<br />The authors also have managed to come up with a coherent theory about the building of the pyramids. Although they do not affirm that the Giza monuments were built in 10,500 BC, their research and evidence presented in this book leds you to your very own conclusion that they might actually have been built 8000 before what &quot;traditional&quot; egyptologists claim.<br />Finally I should say that this book is not an easy read. The first 2 3rds of it are simple and deal with much of astronomy and some politics (they are everywhere, aren't they?)<BR>The last half of it is about egyptian mythology and how it fits in the context of the pyramids, the constellations and the authors findings, this part requires a very concentrated read.<br />In all, a must for all the searchers of the truth out there, very helpful at coming at your own conclusions.

The quality of the printing is really good, but the story and some characters are kinda weak. The good stuff is finally we find out how Vader came to know of his son and the hunting he begins. The problem with the story is that it drifts away in subplots of minor characters that got absolutely nothing to do with the atual plot. This way  the reader finds himself jumping from the story of an envy alliance pilot  to a female bounty hunter (Not THAT one, though) and spend little time with  the actual conflict between Vader and Luke.

Although the book is a little repetitive (You just can read so many times the story behind Thx or how he became a  film maker) it lets you inside the professional life of a man known for not  giving many interviews in a year. The best article is by far the 1997  interview-story that John Seabrook wrote. And here's a little note for the  editors, in page 186, the writer mentions that Lucas adopted 3 daughters,  so next print you may want to correct that one. Enjoyable book, but get the  cheap edition :-)	1999-12-28

It's a little too deep so you'll want to read it again and again, but instead of just reading the deep concepts of Takuan, you  awake to them as you read, it's like remembering something you, somehow,  already knew.	1999-08-09

The writing is down to earth, yet descriptive and complete, leaves you wanting to know  more, especially great is the step by step narration Dietz makes of the  first Dark Forces level. The illustrations are great, but i found a couple  of errors in this book: Acording to JK game, Kyle doesn't get his  lightsaber until level three of the game, this book refers to Dark Forces,  so why is he painted with a saber in the cover and other 2 illustrations?  Also, when he meets Jan, the description tells us he's wearing a  Stortrooper armor, yet in the drawing he's not...great book,  nevertheless...	1999-08-09
