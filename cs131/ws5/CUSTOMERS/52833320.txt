The Lion's Game is better. You should not start this book on a day before you must go to work--lost sleep and lost work are high probabilities. You also should not read this book if your reaction to the horrors of 9/11 is to avoid the world of violence. The Lion's Game has lots of violence, lots of hatred and lots of the material we are now reading and hearing about the why of terrorism. DeMille tells it like it is. He has done his homework--he knows his history, geography, people and institutions, the equipment of death. He knows why Mideast terrorists hate us and he shows the reasons for that hate in a way that is vivid. He also knows why our intelligence community is so flawed and takes us behind closed doors to see those flaws. The Lion's Game plot is horrific; the protagonist and antagonist are in our face; the tension, excitement, yes, the thrill are spine-tingling. One of our reactions to 9/11 will be a national reticence to depict terrorism in movies, on TV and in books. I hope we can keep our perspective between what we value as Americans and what we use for escapist entertainment. I hope that Nelson DeMille gives us more of John Corey and Asad Khalil.	2001-10-10

He also creates great titles--who can resist the offer of &#8220;Perfect Health?&#8221; I checked it out at the library because I was compelled to see if the book lived up to the title. Chopra introduces us to what he calls the &#8220;quantum mechanical human body.&#8221; His theory is that &#8220;by treating the underlying quantum mechanical body itself, Ayurveda can bring about changes far beyond the reach of conventional medicine, confined as it is to the level of gross physiology.&#8221; Sounds good to me. Let&#8217;s get to those devils, the details. First we take tests to learn which body type we are, Vata, Pitta, or Kapha, or a combination thereof. We learn that these names also refer to doshas, &#8220;metabolic principles.&#8221; By implication, we surmise that we must keep these doshas in balance or our health will suffer. We learn about the twenty-five gunas, or fundamental qualities. We learn about the subdoshas. We address How To Balance Your Doshas: diet, exercise, daily routine, seasonal routine. Then we get right to it, Opening the Channels of Healing. This encompasses panchakarma, meditation, primordial sound, pulse diagnosis, marma therapy, bliss technique, aroma therapy and Gandharva music therapy. That&#8217;s where my problems with this book began. After convincing me of the value of meditation I learned that &#8220;meditation needs to be learned from a qualified instructor, it cannot be learned from a book.&#8221; Primordial sound, I read, &#8220;is a medical treatment taught by a qualified Ayurvedic doctor after a complete diagnosis of the patient&#8217;s condition.&#8221; Then &#8220;any patient who comes in for a consultation with an Ayurvedic doctor is routinely given pulse diagnosis.&#8221; &#8220;Most Ayurvedic clinics offer a special marma therapy that includes instruction for home treatment.&#8221; As for the bliss technique, &#8220;Instruction is by a qualified teacher who is also an Ayurvedic physician and takes about an hour; a complete medical evaluation precedes the actual teaching.&#8221; Finally, at aroma therapy, we find something we can do for ourselves, but we are pointed to page 317, where we may find sources for oil, aroma pots and diffusers. Ghandharva music also requires no instruction beyond the book, except of course we are told to buy the tapes and CDs &#8220;from the sources listed on page 317.&#8221; The marketing continues with Ayurvedic herbs, called rasayana. After selling us on the value of same, &#8220;You can obtain further information regarding these rasayanas by writing to Quantum . . .&#8221; We are also encouraged to drink teas appropriate to our body types--yes, from sources on page 317. My biggest disappointment, though, came in the section on diet. I learned that I should not be eating many of the items that have kept me healthy for sixty-five years, onions, garlic, carrots, spinach, tomatoes, bananas, yogurt, cheese and eggs, and that I should be drinking cow&#8217;s milk which I&#8217;ve not touched in decades, and I should be eating ghee, which is butter with the water cooked out of it. Chopra writes that I should minimize raw foods, which flies in the face of everything I have learned about food over the last many decades.<br />This book contains some reasonable ideas. The rub is that the book buyer gets only a few ideas they can use and a lot of ideas for which the author tells us we need an Ayurvedic doctor or products. As usual in his books, he provides scientific tidbits, sensational anecdotes and little scientific data.<br />Ayurvedic theory and practice dates back in India more than 5,000 years. Chopra urges us that Ayurvedic practitioners and practices will give us longevity and perfect health. Ayurveda is &#8220;the science of life&#8221;  or, as Chopra prefers, &#8220;the knowledge of life span.&#8221; Others say it is the science of longevity. I checked that out. According to The World Health Organization, India ranks 134th of the 191 countries recognized for &#8220;healthy life expectancy.&#8221; (The USA ranks 24th.) There are other reasons why Indian health statistics are so poor, but it is difficult to take seriously an ancient practice that seems to have failed in its native country. I think that Deepak Chopra is an essentially good person who has been caught up in the American mania for fame and fortune.  I suggest that our money is better spent on books that give instructions we can follow without travelling to a doctor&#8217;s office or buying exotic foods, herbs and essences.tion, India ranks 134th of the 191 countries recognized for &#8220;healthy life expectancy.&#8221; (The USA ranks 24th.)

The essence of his power is nature. \\"Nature is not a place to visit, it is home-and within that home territory there are more familiar and less familiar places.\\" Two sons, one Pulitzer, many other awards so far.

This book has nuggets on nearly every page. And unlike some authors, Raymond is open-minded to the various gardening methods and  has tried them. Even better, he has worked in different soils in different  parts of the country. And he is innovative.<br />I am not a fan of tillers and  I am biased against chemicals, so Raymond had to overcome my initial  skepticism. He did. While he extols the use of his tiller [he has a long  relationship with Troy-Bilt, owned by Garden Way, publishers of this book],  he also shows how to garden without one. And in most cases he offers  organic alternatives to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore,  he started out on a farm, paid for his first home with a garden and  roadside stand, has appeared in food production documentaries and has given  gardening classes throughout the country, face-to-face and on radio and  television.<br />I do not agree with all he writes, nor is he inclusive of all  gardening methods, for instance Fukuoka's no-till, Steiner's biodynamics or  Mollison's permaculture. But in gardening, the proof is in the eating and  it is clear that Dick Raymond eats very well. Beginning, mid-field and  advanced gardeners alike will learn valuable techniques for soil  enrichment, bed-building, seed-growing, transplanting, spacing,  weed-killing and insect-handling. He is excellent on green manure crops,  seeding and harvesting. I was especially taken with his Eternal Yield  experimental plots, where he imports only seeds and lime but has improved  yields and soil over a ten-year period. \\"My goal was to plant different  sequences of green manure crops to see if they alone could provide all the  nutrients food crops need. My guidelines were simple: don't add any  fertilizer, compost, or manures to the soil. As for organic matter, till  under only the crops that grow on the plot. Do not bring in any outside  material--no leaves, no mulch, nothing.\\"<br />This is the best-illustrated  gardening book I have found. Hundreds of color photos and drawings on  high-quality paper illustrate every lesson. All popular plants are given  their own coverage including gourds, peanuts and sunflowers. In the section  on pests I learned a technique I am eager to try on the mole army  here--sticking pieces of blackberry canes into the runways. There is an  insect pest section as well as one on diseases. An eight-page planting  guide supplements and synopsizes earlier coverage, there are maps on first-  and last-expected frost dates.

Double pages, no.	This title grew from a 1971 experimental garden in Palo Alto, California instigated by Alan Chadwick and Stephen Kafka. That garden showed that  using the biodynamic/French Intensive method produced four times more  vegetables than conventional techniques.<br />Biodynamic techniques were  developed by Austrian genius Rudolf Steiner. French Intensive methods were  developed in the 1890s by market gardeners outside Paris, a time when  horses provided more-than-ample fertilizer and the city provided a ready  market for vegetables. Chadwick studied under Steiner and French  gardeners.<br />The method requires double-digging garden beds and adding  compost or aged manure. Double-digging to two feet in depth provides loose  soil that roots easily penetrate. Plants are seeded or transplanted very  close together and form a living mulch, shading roots, causing greater  water retention, denying sunlight to weeds. Other aspects of the method are  planting and transplanting by the phases of the moon and daily sprinkling  rather than periodical flooding.<br />This material has been recycled four  times since the 1974 typewritten edition. I regret to report it is no  longer up-to-date gardening knowledge, it will intimidate beginning  gardeners, and it will bore experienced gardeners. There is only one new  chapter, titled Sustainability, which is mostly promotion of Ecology  Action. In addition, Jeavons seems confused. In the first four editions he  wrote that he was teaching us the \\"biodynamic/French intensive method\\" of  Steiner and French gardeners as learned and taught by Chadwick. Now in a  chapter titled A Perspective for the Future, he writes that his work is  based on the \\"Chinese Biointensive way of farming.\\" Yet nowhere does he  advocate or tell how to use humanure, which is the basis of Chinese food  production, as first shown by F.H. King in his book, Farmers of Forty  Centuries. Only in the bibliography do we find book listings under the  heading: Human Waste. The huge bibliography (36 pages, was 22 pages in the  last edition) apparently lists every book and catalog in the Ecology Action  library but there is NO INDEX! I find the lack of an index in a nonfiction  book to be unforgivable. For instance, looking for crop rotation or  mulching methods means scanning the entire 201 pages--and coming up  empty.<br />There are pages and pages of drawings and technical charts that  most readers will never use. We find listings of plants and information  both barely usable--seeds per ounce, pounds consumed per average person per  year--and important--bed spacing, yields--although there is no recognition  or advice concerning the many soil types and growing zones. One is dismayed  to find--in a book titled How to Grow More Vegetables--more pages of charts  about grain, protein source, vegetable oil crops; cover, organic matter,  fodder crops; energy, fiber paper and other crops; tree and cane crops--20  pages in all, than about vegetable crops--8 pages.<br />Promotion of Ecology  Action uses a fourteen-page chapter in addition to six more pages of  self-promotion in the Sustainability chapter. If you want to support  Jeavons' work, send a check to Ecology Action, or buy his book, The  Sustainable Vegetable Garden, adapted from this book by co-author Carol  Cox, which is smaller and less expensive and has all his best stuff without  the wasted pages of charts, drawings and promotion, and it has an index! If  you want current gardening information, read authors such as Eliot Coleman  and Dick Raymond who are progressive and work with all garden designs,  including the mulch method first popularized by Ruth Stout and now used by  hundreds of my gardening friends across the country. Most of us have tried  the double-dig method and have long since moved on. I recommend you not  waste your time, except maybe once for new gardens, depending on soil  conditions. Thereafter, use mulch, save your back and spend your time and  energy on better pursuits.rsuits.	2000-05-31

He knows modern American farm life as it really is, not only its hard-wrought joy  but its deep, dark underbelly. Here he exposes the sad facts of crop  subsidies and their effect on people who before political propaganda and  intervention had the common sense to farm on a family scale and enjoyed the  satisfaction that derived therefrom. Tractors that cost more than a farm  should cost. Soil death by toxic chemicals and erosion. The criminal  collusion (my words, not Logsdon's) of land grant agriculture colleges,  equipment companies, chemical companies and politicians. The stupidity of  laws that put Amish minister Henry Hershberger in jail for building a  superior house but without a permit because of his religious beliefs.  Logsdon also shows what works. The Kemp farm of Jerusalem, Ohio, with only  140 acres but a carefully built herd of cows whose pedigree commands value  nationwide. A Berkeley, California, \\"farm\\" of one-third acre that grosses  more than $300,000. The Amish farmers, whose success embarrasses  agribusiness practitioners. Logsdon cares about people and nature.

This may be because each author sees something unique, but it may be that community defies narrow definition, indeed, encompasses all of life's values and activities. What  some call community is simply a neighborhood of people with little in  common but geography. At the other extreme are cyber groups of individuals  with only a common interest and the equipment to communicate with each  other, yet they perceive themselves as a community. Co-author Ken Norwood  was born in 1924, enjoyed a large family living throughout Southern  California when each town was separate and distinct, served in WWII as part  of a B-24 crew flying missions out of Britain, spent one year as a Nazi  POW, became an architect-planner, worked in several intentional communities  as carpenter-architect, founded the Shared Living Resource Center in  Berkeley, California. So he has seen community from many perspectives.  Co-author Kathleen Smith also chose the field of architecture, has traveled  widely, has pursued a career in community design. Therefore this book  focuses on the role of habitation in community. Most designs presented are  for cities. The one chapter about rural community design is titled Rural  Communities, the Romance and the Reality, which shows urban bias.  But--country living advocate that I am--their material is inclusive and  their arguments are sound. Country life is not for everybody--in truth,  most Americans prefer to live in cities and suburbs and the current social  and political climate favors and facilitates urban and suburban living. The  anguish over loss of community has been expressed in a plethora of public  polls. When community ceases, bureaucracy increases. Can citizens rebuild  community and take back those parts of their lives that are now controlled  by government ? The authors of this work go a long way in showing how that  can be accomplished.	2000-05-08

His gorgeous Healing Plants calendar is  on my wall; the verdant photos provide daily pleasure.  Herbal preparations  as alternatives to synthetic drugs are increasingly chosen. St. John's Wort  for depression, Saw Palmetto for prostate treatment, Goldenseal for a  multitude of symptoms. Not typically thought of as herbs, trees are also a  part of our living pharmacy and 66 are included here. Ginkgolides extracted  from leaves of the Ginkgo tree (ginkgo biloba) are the best-selling herbal  preparation in Europe. Aspirin derives from the willow. Amongst shrubs I  learned that Hawthorn leaf and flower preparations are used in Germany to  treat congestive heart failure, based on at least 14 controlled clinical  studies. With increasing usage, many plants are in danger of being  overharvested. Conservation is necessary to preserve a viable natural  community of plants that can and may help alleviate human suffering.  Stopping plant thieves is a law enforcement challenge but easy  identification of plants may save others of us from bulldozing a patch of  ginseng for a house site. It is noted that Pale Purple Coneflower  (Echinacea pallida) \\"is common in eastern Kansas but it is very rare in  western North Carolina at the eastern extreme of its range. The plant might  be judiciously harvested in Kansas, but in North Carolina it should be left  alone.\\" More than just a field guide, Medicinal Plants and Herbs is an  essential reference book for our personal library. The value of this big  little book can hardly be overestimated.	2000-05-05

If your idea of appropriate cost size is a quarter million dollars or more,  this is an idea book with seductive pictures. But if you care about the  world in which your grandchildren will live, don't buy into this mindset,  and don't buy this book.	2000-05-01

During the year that I recommend you observe and inventory natural conditions before you build, you will have time to decide not only where your buildings will be  planted but what their form will be. Here is a book that extols traditional  styles and connects you to the architects who have adapted those styles to  modern codes. Architect/editor Berg has found seventeen designers who are  unabashed proponents of traditional style, most of whom live the country  life, so they have first-hand appreciation for what works and looks best.  Each offers mail-order plans for simple but elegant inexpensive country  homes and outbuildings. Here are drawings of floor plans and exteriors of  86 designs in all, from a 144-square-foot cabin to a farmhouse and  Southern-style cottage with wraparound porch, each of 2,000 square feet.  This is a sampler; I checked out the Web sites of the designers and found  that they offer many more designs. Most offer plan catalogs.<br />In addition  to sourcing working architects' plans, Berg connects the reader to  alternate plan sources, including log homes, timber frame, historic,  magazine and Cooperative Extension plans, which are hard to find but nearly  free. There is also a Resources section of building codes, building book  catalogs and on-line resources, plus other books on country building. The  Country Building Directory has entries from Acorn Forged Iron to West Coast  Weather Vanes. Happy country planning, building and living.	2000-04-29

In 1966, when he was 22, Paolo Lugari and his brother drove over barely passable roads to a desolate area 200 miles east of  Bogota, Columbia. The llanos area is a poor-soil barren that grows only a  few nutrient-deficient grasses, a vast expanse of  sun-baked plains in spite of over 100 inches of rain per year. A place of  deadly water and hungry mosquitos. Conditions were so  daunting that the Columbian government abandoned an attempt to build a road  through the area. Lugari saw an opportunity to  create  something very special. And he did it. Today Gaviotas is a thriving,  sustainable community of hundreds of joyous people  studying, inventing, producing, singing and dancing amidst a huge forest  that they planted. Residents from all walks of life have  designed and built, planted and harvested, birthed, nurtured, taught, and  entertained. There are teeter-totters that operate  super-efficient pumps to bring water to the school, solar heat to cook  meals, solar kettles to sterilize drinking water, ultra-light  windmills to provide power. The hospital has been designated one of the  40 most important buildings in the world. Some have  called  Gaviotas a utopia. Lugari insists that, &quot;Utopia literally means no  place. We call Gaviotas a topia because it's real.&quot;  Gaviotas the village is surprising, uplifting, extraordinary. Gaviotas the  nonfiction book is as compelling as a novel, as  educational as a textbook, as inspirational as the biography of a great  person. If you need to rise early, do not take this book to bed with you.	2000-02-10

In 1981 he received the Right  Livelihood Award--the Alternative Nobel Prize--for his work in  environmental design. He and David Holmgren  coined the word  permaculture; Mollison has devoted his  life to teaching the concept.  Permaculture is humans  working with, not against, nature. It's about  causing  land, water, plants and animals to synergistically cause multiple  benefits and to improve an ecosystem simultaneously. It maximizes  functional connections so that the many parts become a  whole. To create  permaculture design is to make the  strongest possible statement of our  eco-values, a  resounding vote against current agribusiness practices. I have  four of  Mollison's books--this one has it all plus 129 color photos and a gazillion  drawings by  Andrew Jeeves. Here is complete knowledge to create your  personal permaculture, a  place to work and live in harmony with nature, a  place that will nuture your body and your soul.	2000-02-10

Most of us have these  evolved truths deep within us but we rarely think of them. Given here are  253 patterns, each consisting of a design challenge, discussion,  illustration, and solution. Your knowledge of these patterns can help you  to create a home that is a pleasure to live in, one that is imaginative,  inspiring, healthful, and psychologically satisfying as well as fully  functional. I cannot imagine designing any building without refreshing my  memory of these wonderful patterns. First published in 1977, this book has  already attained the status of classic.	2000-01-29

In the period 1984-1987, 54 of the 230 seed companies in the U.S. and Canada went out of business, resulting in 943 non-hybrid varieties  becoming unavailable. One answer to the extinction of food crop varieties  is Seed Savers Exchange, the publisher of Seed to Seed. Begun in 1975, SSE  maintains more than 18,000 rare vegetable varieties at Heritage Farm in  Decorah, Iowa. Another answer is for individual gardeners to save their own  seed from non-hybrid varieties. Varieties that grow and taste exceptionally  well in specific areas can be planted year after year from home-grown seed.  A further advantage is protection from seed price increases. Ashworth  provides definitive information on seed gathering, processing and storage  techniques. Twenty family entries include taxonomy, pollination  characteristics and techniques, general production and processing  techniques. Each of the 160 species entries includes botanical  classification; pollination, crossing, and isolation; seed production,  harvest and processing; seed viability. Ample black-and-white photographs  complement the text.  Hybrid seeds are in the control of large companies.  You can be in control of heirloom varieties that do best in your garden.  Happy eating.	2000-01-13

Eliminate canning and  freezing? Do this all at low cost? Eliot Coleman does, you can, too, and  here is the how. Coleman is a market gardener in Maine who may eat better  than Bill Gates. He shows that sunlight and wind protection are more  important that temperature--and, by the way, most of the U.S. gets more  winter sunlight than Coleman's place. Inexpensive, unheated greenhouses  that he calls tall tunnel houses--some say hoop houses--and cold frames  protect from wind and keep snow off the veggies. Greenhouse comfort is more  to benefit the gardener. The key is what and when to plant. Full info given  for planting dates, construction details, sources of seeds, tools,  greenhouses. Well illustrated. An essential guide for organic gourmands.	1999-10-27

This is touchy  territory--one potential subject flatly told Ehrenhaft it was none of his  damn business. Others made excuses. I'm glad the author persisted. The  result is a balanced offering of widely diverse stories: teacher,  housecleaner, teacher, architect, graphic artist, symphony flutist,  policeman, artist, builder-writer.<br />Most interviewees began their projects  overenthused and underinformed. Lacking knowledge, skills, and tools, they  were impelled by financial necessity, curiosity, fantasy, a hunger for a  transcendent adventure. Men with wives struggling to understand; women  dealing with macho members of the building trades. Personal relationships  gone awry. Disaster and achievement. Despair and elation.<br />The author  found sentiment, resilience, intuition, testing of limits, reverence for  nature, \\"a conspiracy of forces,\\" and \\"`being filled with a thrilling and  joyous sense of Shelter--with a capital S.'\\"<br />Like writers who must write,  owner-builders must build. Pity those who never feel the natural high of  living in their own created shelter. Pity yourself? Or step into the lives  of these nine and live the transcendent moments with them.	1999-09-09
