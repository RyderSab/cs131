I love stories that truly develop their characters, and which contain characters about whom you care. Dickenson seems to be one of those authors, like Anne Tyler and Anne Lamott, who can accomplish this effortlessly. This is a good read, and the ending sweet.	2005-08-07

I found this book thouroughly delightful, and am hoping it is an introduction for me of a thouroughly delightful writer. I enjoyed every moment of the story, just enough tension, just enough truths (without sermonizing or platitudes), just the right descriptions (a poet, of course). Children should thouroughly enjoy this book, and it would be a wonderful read aloud story. My copy is in the Fantasy Annual IV, edited by Terry Carr (Timescape Books,1981). If you just want a tale that is lighthearted and not too childish for an adult to read, this is a lovely vacation book. <br />	2005-08-07

I knew about the first two from her books on writing and her book of paintings; However, I was thrilled to find that she is also a Poet. In my opinion, she is mostly a Poet. I read her novel, \\"Banana Rose,\\" and a novelist she is not. However, her poetry sings. I say this because there are lines that can stand alone with their beauty:  <br />\\"aspen leaf quaking in the quiet of the world...\\"  <br />\\"the cold the lonely face of yearning/and spring broken through the bounty of wingless trees\\"  <br />\\"and the dark bounty of coal about to burst into diamonds\\"   <br />For these three lines alone (from 3 separate poems), this book is worth its weight in gold. The paintings in the book are pure New Mexico, and if you like Southwest art, you will enjoy them. They add to the beauty of the book. I would highly recommend this book to any poetry lover; and I'd highly recommend Natalie publish more poetry.	2005-01-10

She writes real books about characters who are real, substantial and who have hearts that cry and sometimes laugh. Authors who give us life as it is, messy, but don't wallow in bitterness, despair or the shock value of absent values, these are the authors who give us books that are worthwhile. <BR>This is a stunning story about loss and love, about a lost and lonely teenager, and about a lonely, but not so lost, old man who find one another. The twist at the end is sweet, and yet keeps from being sappy. <BR>Highly recommended for teen readers and their parents. Like all great books this is a grand book for any age.	2004-02-22

Here were photographs that spoke volumes, that said here is the spirit of woman that has been hidden by fashion, jewelry, makeup and society's expectations.

It is science fiction/fantasy that has multiple layers and can lead to some deep questions. The parallels to the Middle East cannot be avoided; but the story is so well crafted, that is not a distraction. Surprises emerge when you think you have the characters and plot figured out. And the characters are so well developed, you really get to understand them. I thought Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; and Walker's &quot;Possessing the Secret of Joy&quot; were the most wrenching books on the repression of women in parts of the world, but Marley is masterful in this book. I can highly recommend this novel and this author. Don't miss &quot;The Glass Harmonica&quot; as well.	2002-10-24

I tried to read this book, but I was stopped cold when Mr. Pinker declared that there was no such thing as a soul. Outside of any religious sense, I still fail to see how he comes to this conclusion, and how he can justify it. By the use of convoluted logic, I suppose. He is arrogant enough to declare himself an authority; but I remember the real authority Leo Buscaglia saying &quot;I met many PhD's. When I left the man who had worked with me (in getting his license), I told him 'Call me if you ever need help.'&quot;<br />Just my humble opinion.	2002-10-24

I am reviewing this book in October and just realized what a great read this would be for this holiday.

Heads in the sand don't cut it with Gloria. <BR>But, reading the reviews, I don't remember all the characters were dead at the end (?) and I didn't realize some of them tied in to her other books. Fascinating. Now I have to go read it again--goody!<BR>The thing I DO remember most from this book was the way one of the characters was taken off heroin. That method is brutal, but you know I think it would work. Not without compassion, nonetheless. <BR>Add Gloria Naylor to your list of best authors if you like well developed characters, and meaningful writing.	2002-10-24

Not only is the character a transgender M2F, but a lesbian as well. Not only is she in love, she is in love with  heterosexual whom she met and courted as a man. Going from one to another as narrators makes the tale more readable and believable. Chris is an expert at getting inside his characters. I felt I understood more about the subject of transgenders after reading this book. However, I still don't feel the characters would have interacted in this way. I really didn't buy the ending either. But this book is worth a read, especially if you want to know about a subject BEFORE making judgments.	2002-08-09

I was first struck by the abslute genius of the writing in this book. It should be used in writing workshops--the use of tension is maintained right from page one to the last page. Also, a masterful use of first person and multiple periods of time, flashbacks that are not confusing as most writers tend to make them. I found myself really caring about all the characters, except maybe the jerk prosecuting attorney. It also is like \\"House of Sand and Fog\\", where no one is really a bad guy, things just turn out miserably for everyone. So here is moral dilemma on many levels: do you save the baby or the mother? do you report your mentor when you believe they have done something unethical, or maybe criminal? is destroying evidence really immoral in all cases? how DO you deal with mistakes that may have cost a life--how do you deal with being responsible for Life? <BR>This novel has none of the prdictablilty that writers like Elizabeth Berg fall prey to in otherwise enjoyable stories.<BR>I'm not sure how some of the other reviewers missed the obvious depth and craft of this novel. Perhaps they Should stick to Dick & Jane. I think this is one of the best novels I've read in many years, and will no doubt remain so for some time.<BR>One caution: do not read this if you are pregnant or contemplating becoming so. The description of labor is an antidote for the population explosion.	2002-05-31

This book is a long tantrum of poor me, how the white man stripped us of everything, and how the white man is exploiting the Indian still. Nerburn whines as much as the old man whose life he is chronicling. Neither makes the point for resolution or reconciliation. I can agree there are those who are Indian wannabees; I can agree that several hundred years ago, some callus, stupid Europeans destroyed a rich and valuable culture. But how does whining over that for several hundred pages help? The elder alternately complains because the white man doesn't want to learn about the Indian culture and because the white man wants to learn about the Indian culture. It is very simple for him. Indian good, white man bad. And everything since Columbus landed is the white man's fault. I don't buy it, and I don't recommend you do either.	2002-05-06

She writes with authority because she has walked in those shoes. When standing in line and feeling totally exhausted because of her illness, another woman is wheeled to the front of the line in a wheelchair. Thus the perfect illustration of the difficulty. She uses the classic Dumas novel &quot;Camille&quot; to illustrate the status of the sufferer, and the reaction of those surrounding her. This is a book of perspective, and one that should be read by anyone in the caring professions, and anyone with a loved one who has an &quot;invisible&quot; illness.	2002-04-07

Death has been spirited away behind closed doors, and banished from our thoughts until it forces its way through, as it always will. This is a must read for anyone working in \\"Health Care\\" or with the elderly, also anyone counseling families and the dying. I would hope to find it on a required reading list for medical schools as well. de Beauvoir gives an honest, raw account of her thoughts and fears as her Mother dies; it is a bit reassuring to see that not all of those thoughts are pure and idyllic. She gives any ethics committee a firm reference point  in the consideration of assisted death vs. assisted living. Read this book, it will enhance your life.	2002-03-12

People need to have values and integrity. But eventually her finger wagging and self-righteousness got to me. Then I began to look more closely at her advice; shunning, judging, and the most obvious: oversimplification. It is easy to judge when you over-simplify the issues. But life isn't black and white, it is many shades of grey. Although she will tell you she has faced challenges, any person who feels they are always right and you are always wrong will have lessons to learn. <BR>On the other hand, I feel she has often been mis-judged and abused herself. We do, as a society, seem to look for ways to shoot down anyone who stands up for good, and who has integrity of their beliefs. If you listen closely to her, she is actually compassionate. I agree with her stand on day care, working mothers, and thoughtless pregnancies. I could go into examples, but it would get pretty ridiculous. <BR>Suffice it to say, this book is a good balance for books like Ann Rice puts out, and the many SELF help books.	2002-01-02

Then I was angry	I wanted to read this book because I heard Barbara on several interviews. I, too, had some problems with her brief trial of living poor, when for so many it is not a choice; however, I believe her intent was to point out the truth about poverty: hard work does not equal success in this country. Success is mainly a product of rich parents, a college education, good breaks, and an ability to sell oneself due to a good self-image and some smarts. When you start at the bottom, in most cases it is nearly impossible to break free of that. Middle class is not what I am talking about. I am talking about kids who start out malnourished, abused, without proper health care, in inner city schools, and with single/split and less than interested parents. It is okay to &quot;make wrong choices&quot; when rich, because money can fix alot of things. If you are poor, it means the door not only closes but locks. <BR>It is time for America to stop believing the Horatio Alger myth, and find out why thousands of children go without proper nourishment, education, safety, housing, and opportunity in this land. <BR>It is also time to remember the middle class is a buffer from revolution. When it is forced to the lower class, we all will pay. <BR>Also remember that there is no us &amp; &quot;them&quot;. What will you do when you get your lay off papers?<BR>Bravo, Barbara!	2001-12-21

I think Ms. Berg must have been reading my diaries or a fly on the wall. This is nearly my life story! And yes, do not doubt her characters are real. I'll allow her some poetic license for taking off mid-day to  spend a day at the beach with her patient, for breaking all ethical codes by falling in love with him and having him move into her home (her agency must be pretty lenient--I wasn't allowed to sit by my patient's bedside in the hospital). But this is a novel, not a treatise on the politics of home health. The ending is the most poignant since &quot;One True Thing&quot; and she ranks up there with Anne Tyler and Anna Quindlen for character development. I'll be reading lots more of her work.

I read the book in one evening. Many times I came away puzzled, or turning the page for the rest of the story, but it is so refreshing in these days of computers and Canned TV, ads and radio to find someone with true Imagination that I have to give her 5 stars. I read &quot;the Healing&quot; in Story Magazine, and had to go find more of Aimee. I don't think the stories are necessarily deep. Existential--maybe. Poetry, yes--if poetry is a love affair with words. I'd rate her as a wonderful writer. Wish I had that talent.	2001-04-30

I am in awe of this writer, and being a poet that says something. She is a wonderful story weaver. I believe she must be a gentle, loving, spiritual person to write with such depth of feeling and gentle understanding. If anyone has lost a loved one, I highly recommend this book. I can't wait to read the rest of her works.	2001-04-28

There are things about Darcey's writing that I don't like--sometimes, I just can't picture her characters and their setting, and I get lost at times in where the plot is going. In Jesus Saves, I never did understand why she juxtaposed Ginger and Sandy, or the deal with the deer. But I always will pick up a book by Darcey because her use of words is so eloquent. The best part of this book is the dream sequences that Sandy uses to stay alive. Darcey Steinke writes from the dark side. Redemption and meaning do not enter in.	2001-04-22

Susan Griffin writes from experience, and yet  manages to write an objective, thoughtful book on illness and what it means  to society. Although New Age prides itself in having escaped the  restrictive judgments of past centuries, and mind/body philosophies and  metaphysics portray themselves as more enlightened, Susan exposes the  underlying hypothesis for what it is--the same old moralism: &quot;If you  think the right thoughts, you won't be ill.&quot; &quot;You are ill because  there is something for you to learn.&quot; We still want to believe, she  points out, that we are greater than Nature, that we are in control. Yet,  anyone who has had a chronic or severe illness knows how very little  control we do have. Perhaps, after all, New Age is just another way of  dealing with the knowledge that someday, no matter how good we are, we all  will suffer and die.	2000-09-10

What is most astounding is Kenneth Koch's  humility and honesty, and his willingness to admit mistakes made in  teaching poetry to a group of old people at a nursing home. He divides the  book very usefully as well. First he introduces the process from start to  finish of the workshops, including some of the seniors' works. In the  second half of the book, he prints the poems done by participants for each  exercise first, then discusses what occurred during the session. One  participant in particular is very much a poet, although he'd never written  poetry before, and I  fell quite in love with him. However, as the book  went to press, Kenneth says, this man passed on. You will thouroughly enjoy  this book. Aside from the poetry, it has alot to say about the assumptions  we make about old and/or infirm people.	2000-08-27

Perhaps if the sixties was more like  this experience for you, you would enjoy it more. But by the end, I just  didn't care what happened to Banana Rose. I thought she was nuts for not  rushing into her female lover's arms and staying there. And she does whine,  on &amp; on, while refusing to face facts. Like all of us, I suppose. I'd  rather enjoy Natalie on writing, and her wonderful voice.	2000-08-27

The subject is disturbing,and also very complex. I have great respect for Ms. Walker as a master writer and storyteller and as a woman of integrity. Sometimes her  views are a bit too feminist for me (I think fathers do have value in a  child's life, for instance), and I agree the issue is much more complex  than man's will to dominate women (although it would be hard to argue that  this practice stems from anything else.) However, sometimes to fight  against  a tradition this ancient and so firmly imbedded in an ancient  culture, one has to have a narrow vision. I had some trouble keeping up  with the time line while listening, and although the speakers were  announced, that got a bit tedious to keep track of as well. Maybe that was  clearer in the written text. Certainly the elders' conversation that Tashi  heard as a girl did not come across well in the tape: it would have been  better to act it out with different voices than identify as &quot;number  one&quot; &quot;Number two,&quot; etc. One of the best things I liked about  listening to the tape version was Alice's silky velvet voice. My oh My! Her  co-reader does a fine job with dialects with the exception of Benny, who  sounds very cultured and educated and not at all &quot;slow&quot; despite  pauses. I loved the conclusion, and the last two poetic lines took my  breath away. This issue came to our town several years ago when a family  insisted on the operation in a local hospital. Despite efforts to stop it,  the doctors (do no harm? ) went ahead with the procedure; to my shame.	2000-03-25

Some of the poems made it into lyrics, but in neither case can I make any sense of them. Alot of teen angst and anger comes through, to the point of being  painful. Being as I adore Janis' talent, this book was painful to read. I'm  glad she chose songwriting. However, with the talent and depth of her  lyrics today, maybe she should try poetry again. It would be awesome.	2000-03-25

This book was originally published in 1975, one of her earlier works, but rings with the same truth today as then.  Soft-spoken, Walker nonetheless is sure of her truths, and diligent in  communicating them. Love poems for her people, for all people, and for the  men she has been accused of hating. Thanks, Alice, for your spirit.	2000-03-18

Too often, I have heard doctors tell patients it was all in  their head, or just go home and learn to live with it. Too often, I have  felt I was just being lazy or crazy (the Z words) because standing in line  and getting up in the morning required concentrated effort and will. All  medical and health personnel should be required to read this book. It is  written in easy, understandable language and so is appropriate for family  of ICI patients and helpful for those suffering from chronic illness as  well. Hopefully, some day research will give us clues as to why so many of  these &quot;syndromes&quot; seem to be increasing in frequency. If you  suffer from any chronic illness I salute you for your courage and  strength.This book is for you.	1999-12-31

Dickinson is a fabulous writer, and develops his  characters so that you are certain you know them. His writing reminds me of  Anne Tyler (trade Baltimore for Chicago).One of the ways the elderly lose  their rights is the loss of the driver's license.

I discovered Jane Kenyon when her poem &quot;Otherwise&quot; and her beautiful presence aired on Bill Moyers' &quot;The Language of Life&quot;. It was the year I found I could no longer tolerate my depression and set  about creating a new life that I learned of her depression. I learned that  she had been born one year earlier, and in her poetry I found us kindred  spirits. Then I found she was dying of leukemia, and indeed died that next  year after the research center across the street had once again made  promises it could not keep. My best friend's husband had heard the same  promises and suffered the same fate. Last week Seattle's beloved school  superintendent had those same promises fail him. When I heard Donald Hall  had written poems on her death, I had a mixed reaction. I did not want her  death minimized or exploited. Yet, I wanted her remembered, her courage and  victory over herself. So it was some months later when I picked up  &quot;Without&quot; and began reading of the journey Donald and Jane made  together, a journey not unfamiliar to those who have taken the path before  them. I felt their pain, their love, and their courage. It was difficult  reading, I felt as though I knew her personally, and I grieved her more  than others. But he wrote with grace, love and truth. Jane is there in the  poems, and in all the works she leaves beind. If only we had had her for a  little longer.	1998-12-02

I discovered Nancy Willard through this new book of poetry, and she won my heart immediately. Her poems are about everyday ordinary things that we mortals overlook and take for granted. Nancy opens our eyes and helps us to see the wonder all around us. It does not surprise me she also writes for children, for it is with the wonder of the child that she brings her vision to us. Yet her poetry is profound, and to be read and reread, new meanings appearing with each reading. This is a poet's poet, and her writing a study in imagery and a study in life. Thank you, Nancy.	1997-12-10
