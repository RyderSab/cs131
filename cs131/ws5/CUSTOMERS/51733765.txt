For these principles I give the book five stars. The only problem is that you can get the principles by reading the table of contents...which isn't necessarilly a bad thing but one expects to get more in depth explanations inside the chapters. What I got was a litany of arguments and examples for a &quot;stereotypical American&quot;-- a sort of Oprah-watching couch potato with low self-esteem. I didn't associate with McGraw's examples and I'm not sure there are many who do (at least not those who are taking the time to read a book about personal life strategies). In short, I felt that McGraw haad some brilliant life strategy ideas and then he played to the least common denominator in American society. But, I loved the table of contents!	2001-01-31

It is especially fun to flip through and look at all of the illustrations which are just as valuable as the reading. My only criticism of the mind mapping model and subsequent software is that it is &quot;too centralized.&quot; Natures systems are often decentralized where many hubs are of equal importance. Our mind is the same. Our thoughts are built upon many &quot;hubs&quot; of equal importance rather than one central hub in the middle of many radiating thoughts. In other words, I have found mind mapping to be far more useful when thought of as a &quot;network&quot; rather than a &quot;central hub&quot; like that of a wheel with radiating spokes. A decentralized network is made of many equal hubs with many radiating thoughts and ideas which relate to other thoughts and ideas and other hubs. No single hub is more relevant, &quot;bigger,&quot; or more &quot;central&quot; than any other. In this way, the system has greater integrity and stability.	2001-01-26

The genius of DaVinci is inspiring and Gelb does a great job of piecing together the Maestro's genius into 7 easy to understand principles. For me, the practice sections detract from the rest of the book although I'd guess that many people find these sections helpful for giving context and making the principles pragmatic.	2001-01-26

It has some good ideas and presents a solid model. My only concern is the focus on time management and the personal planner. If we are to become a society entirely obsessed with time management and personal effectiveness, perhaps we are missing the joy of rambling without purpose. But, if you need greater time management and effectiveness, there are some excellent and helpful concepts in this book. I have found the circle of concern/influence to be a timeless lesson.	2001-01-23

If Gardner is writing to the educational theorists then perhaps they will wade through the drudgery, but these ideas are worthy of the general public.	2001-01-23

This is a simple book, but beneath the four simple agreements lies an underworld of complexity that all of us should embrace.	2001-01-23

And on page 1 I was excited. And on page 10 I was excited and on page 15 , and 30 and 40 I began to be less excited...Devlin, who is supposedly a real master in the field didn't seem to provide any answers. Sometimes he would ask a good question and I got excited that there would be an equally good answer and instead found an answer that seemed like one a smart guy with very little time would come up with. This books reads like a disjointed work, like a publisher wanted another book...and fast and Devlin had to race to put together some ideas. I don't doubt Devlin is intelligent, but his assumptions seem to lack any kind of depth or definition.	2001-01-23

But, if one takes their time there is much to be learned. I especially appreciated the icons that Senge uses throughout the book (explained at the start) that help the reader to organize their thoughts and to put the ideas into context. This is definately a fieldbook for the leader of the learning organization--a guide that can be used and referred to over and over again.	2001-01-23

I know Anderson is supposed to be one of the great thinkers in thought but I take issue with his title..If you're going to name a book Atomic Components of x, then you need to offer something resembling atomic components???? For example, physics gives us atoms, quarks, leptons, etc. Chemistry the Periodic Table of Elements...Are &quot;memory,&quot; &quot;knowledge representation,&quot;  &quot;performance,&quot; &quot;learning,&quot; &quot;the visual interface,&quot; or any of Anderson's other chapters really atomic components. These all seem to be large, general concepts rather than atomic, &quot;unsplittable&quot; componenentry...The book itself is worth the read for academics and the like but if you judge a book by its title, Anderson misses the mark.	2001-01-23

But it could be better. Einstein said, &quot;things should be as simple as possible but not simpler.&quot; I think this book is overly complex, not because its inherently hard to understand, but because I think the mind is complex based on simple rules. In other words, while the human mind is wildly complex, the functions that lie beneath are dumbfoundingly simple. Minsky gives us a great deal of food for thought which is interesting and valuable, but I found myself wanting more simplicity, better organization from one of the great thinkers from MIT. When you listen to the greats (Feynman, Einstein) they made things so simple yet the things they describe are so universally relevant. I wanted Minsky to do the same.	2001-01-23

The model itself however can be understood by reading a single page of text (or atleast only one chapter). I found Senge's follow up fieldbook to be more useful.	2001-01-23

Combining the venerable Pooh with the Tao was a great idea and Hoff pulls it off very well. There are two classifications (to my mind) of &quot;The Tao of...&quot; books: one is poorly thought out and the other is very enlightening. The Tao of Pooh is in the latter group. In other words, the ideas fit together and one simultaneously gets new insight both on Pooh and the Tao.	2001-01-23
