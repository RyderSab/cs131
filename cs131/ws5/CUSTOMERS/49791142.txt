With \\"In Praise of Slowness,\\" Carl Honore offers a gift that is simultaneously outrageous and practical --- what a great combination. It is outrageous in that our culture has become so addicted to speed (the pace, not the drug) that for many of us, the idea of slowing down and making more conscious choices about how our time is spent is perceived as nearly impossible. It is practical in that there is nothing impossible about what Honore describes and recommends in this useful and enlightening book.<br />As a psychotherapist, speaker and author (Embracing Fear &amp; Finding the Courage to Live Your Life) who teaches the advantages of living life by decision rather than default, I appreciate Honore's emphasis on responsibility of choice. He is not recommending that we exchange one end of the continuum (speed) for the opposite end (slowness). Instead this book is about developing the full range of choices --- as in, \\"I want to be ready and able to move as quickly in life as the situation calls for, but I also want to be capable and willing to slow down and not approach every task and every errand as if is a matter of life or death.\\"<br />\\"In Praise of Slowness\\" takes us on a very interesting tour of places where slowness is already becoming more valued (and practiced). He gives examples ranging from individuals to medical professionals (that's not about the long, slow wait to see the doctor), to even city planners who are designing communities that are conducive to slowing it all down. Much of this is about a return to bottom-line human values --- caring more about the quality of our lives than the quantity of items we check off our list at the end of each day.<br />Most of all, this is a book about the importance of being in charge of our own lives. This is an informative, enlightening and entertaining read, and I recommend that you make time to read it. <br />And get an extra copy to leave on the desk of the busiest, most rushed person you know.<br />- Thom Rutledge,author of Embracing Fear &amp; Finding the Courage to Live Your Life	2004-05-24

Thank goodness for this book. Ted Halstead has collected some real gems here. The essays are excellent in and of themselves, but this book screams a bigger message: if we cannot collectively think outside the box of partisan politics, the good ole U.S. of A. is on its way down the tube. <br />The Real State of the Union contains intelligent analysis, accurate problem identification and &quot;real&quot; problem solving. As a psychotherapist and author (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco) reflecting on the lack of mental health and emotional development in our nation's political system, this book offers some rare and welcome hope that it may not be too late.<br />The chief characteristic that distinguishes human beings from other species is our endless capacity to miss the point. Only through genuine connection and authentic communication can we change this. The Real State of the Union is significant in its potential to take us in that direction. <br />Buy several copies of this one and share it with friends. Let's follow Mr. Halstead's lead.

This book has the wrong title: Positive Pushing. It is not about \\"pushing;\\" it is about encouraging, inspiring and guiding children. Most importantly this is a book that teaches parents how to pay attention, how to respect, and how to respond to their children in ways that will contribute to their becoming satisfied and fulfilled in childhood and beyond. <br />As a psychotherapist I spend a significant amount of my time helping people to break free from all or none, black and white thinking learned --- you guessed it --- in childhood. Dr. Taylor's emphasis on an expanded definition for success lays a solid foundation for teaching children how to experience themselves outside the box of such limited thinking, setting the stage for us to offer the next generation legitimate alternatives to double-binding, self-defeating concepts of success that have nothing to do with genuine happiness.<br />Best selling author Alice Miller (The Drama of the Gifted Child, Breaking Down the Walls of Silence, etc) reminds us that if we are serious about changing the world, it can only begin with caring for our children. Positive Pushing will help you be a better parent --- definitely. But the book's own potential is bigger than that.

It works kind of like \\"Find the Hidden Picture\\" in the children's magazine, Highlights: at first you don't see the shoe, the spoon and the puppy, but once you discover them, there is no way to stop seeing them. In the tradition of New World, New Mind by Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich, Shoveling Fuel takes us past the point of no return on the road of increased awareness.<br />Specifically Brian Czech teaches us the fallacy of neoclassical economics, explaining that our pursuit of the illogical and predictably elusive goal of constant and infinite economic growth will result in devastating consequences to be paid by generations to come. Czech makes this a little more personal by referring to the generations who will pay the piper for our foolishness as \\"the grandkids.\\"<br />Czech outlines a new economics, what he calls \\"steady state economics,\\" and he explains himself so clearly that even a guy who can't balance a checkbook (like me) can understand.<br />As a psychotherapist and writer of social/political commentary I love what Czech has to say about how the necessary changes must come as a result of social, rather than political, revolution --- his term is \\"a revolution of public opinion.\\" Translation: the politicians who are supposed to represent us will not change until we do. <br />I am inspired by what Czech has to say on this subject because I believe that his thinking is applicable to issues even broader than the economy. The lesson essentially is that if we don't invest the time and effort into thinking through the big issues of the day, those found under the umbrella of globalization, we might as well start preparing to hand over a complete mess --- our train wreck --- to \\"the grandkids.\\"<br />Read this book.

But in spite of such tremendous competence, they fall under the spell of the irrational beliefs and misaligned values of eating disordered thinking.

Wyatt Webb makes clear in the first sentence of his book that he is NOT a horse whisperer. And even before that (on the book cover in fact) he makes clear that it's NOT about the horse.

One is that children are clay and parents sculptors, assigned the job of molding the clay into what they believe is best. The other metaphor is that children are seeds, and parents gardeners, with the job of caring for  the enviornment surrounding the seeds so that they can grow into whatever they are meant to be. Mimi Doe is a master gardener with a wonderful ability to teach other gardeners.	2002-05-25

Like Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist in Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, Melody Beattie has come unstuck in time. When Billy Pilgrim ceases to experience his life in chronological order, he learns from the invisible inhabitants of the planet Trafalmadore that life is a collection of moments, and that our job is to concentrate on the good ones and try to ignore the bad.<br />Melody Beattie is wiser than a Trafalmadorian. With Choices, she takes us on a journey, skipping from one moment to the next, in her own life and the lives of many others. And whether the moment is about celebrating a victory, dealing with a child's death, jumping out of an airplane, taking a horseback riding lesson, or simply being indecisive, Melody will convince you that every moment is important, and that every moment holds the potential for choice.<br />As a psychotherapist and author (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco 2002) I frequently emphasize to clients and readers that there is an important difference between being \\"in control,\\" and being \\"in charge.\\" Melody's new book is a wonderful collection of lessons about how to be in charge even when we seemingly control nothing.<br />These lessons are not really unstuck in time; they transend time. They are timeless, and well worth reading.	2002-05-19

Alice Miller (author of The Drama of the Gifted Child and Breaking Down the Walls of Silence) has long emphasized that if we are serious about solving society's problems, we must focus on how we treat children --- as individual families and as a cultural. This book is an excellent contribution toward that end.<br />From thought-provoking observations to practical suggestions about solutions, Best Friends, Worst Enemies is an effective education about social problems that begin in childhood, but do not end in childhood. One point the authors make that interests me greatly is that when one child is being bullied by others, the majority of children witnessing the abuse will either do nothing to intervene or they will join in with the bullying. If you think that is not a reflection of the society in which we live, think again.<br />As a psychotherapist and author (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco) who emphasizes personal responsibility and facing fears head on, I hope that more than just parents and educators will read this book. I think there is something here for us all to think about --- no, to do something about.	2002-05-03

It seems inherent to the human condition that we make getting to that simplicity such a complex task. Loving What Is, cuts through that complexity and brings us back home to what is simple, but more importantly, to what is real.<br />As a psychotherapist and author (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco) who emphasizes present-tense focus, self-compassion, and personal responsibility, I will certainly be recommending this book to my clients and readers. The writing is accessible, the content is practical, and the results readers will discover are powerful.<br />The authors have an appreciation for the prevalence of paradox in personal growth, demonstrating repeatedly that the answers we seek are frequently found in the opposite direction from where we have been looking. Most importantly, Ms. Katie's \\"Work\\" shows us how to use the power of acceptance to reclaim a position of authority in our own emotional lives.	2002-05-01

As a psychotherapist and as an author (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco) I have spent the better part of 20 years realizing --- then teaching --- that for life to be good, it must be meaningful, and that the respect we most need to earn is our own. \\"Anyway\\" by Kent Keith is a clear, concise and clever expression of these two essential points. Great truths are simple truths, and this book is full of them.<br />Order at least five (5) copies; you will want to share this one. Sure it's more expensive to buy five copies, but do it anyway.	2002-04-29

The Invitation is the antithesis of the all-too-common, overly simplified self-help books that teach in cliches and promise more than they can possibly deliver. Don't be fooled by her name --- Oriah is a real person living in the real world, with a goal of being the best person she can be. And this book is an honest, intimate sharing of her efforts --- triumphs and failings included.<br />I find it interesting that the negative reviews of The Invitation are written with what seems to me to be so much anger, fear and even hatred. These reviewers frequently site their fears of Oriah's misguided values, but they have no problem investing their energy into going beyond reviewing a book to personally attacking a person they have never met.	2002-04-21

This book is first and foremost, intelligent. It does not tell us that we should not do everything in our power to protect our children from sexual predators and other potentially harmful and lethal circumstances. It does tell us that we need to be more responsible for how we use our power to protect. Specifically Ms. Levine is advising us on how we might avoid passing along some of our neurotic fears to the next generation. <br />As an author who writes about the importance of distinguishing between productive healthy fear and destructive neurotic fear (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco), I welcome this book and hope that parents, teachers, counselors, clergy and law enforcement professionals will read it before jumping to conclusions and passing judgment. <br />I especially appreciate Ms. Levine's use of interviews and research to help dispel myths and exaggerations about children, sexuality, and specific dangers related to both. Many of us grew up either misinformed or uninformed about sexuality. It just makes sense that we might need a little assistance from authors like Judith Levine to improve the quality of what we do pass on to the next generation.	2002-04-13

Cardinal Arinze says \\"Peace is not an optimal climate for human life and growth --- it is a necessity.\\" If this is true, then of course we are in a lot of trouble. But from the Cardinal's insistence that half-measures are useless measures, he still manages to confront us with the hard truth while remaining consistently compassionate.<br />While I do not agree with all of Cardinal Arinze's religious views, I am grateful to him for representing the importance of tolerance and understanding within and among all of the world's religions. It is, after all, the narrow view of exclusivity (If I am right, you are by definition wrong), not religious doctrine itself, that contributes to religions being used as excuses and justification for destructive conflict. Cardinal Arinze emphasizes the need for education about other religions and cultures --- as opposed to perpetuating propaganda --- as a part of every faith community's responsibility.<br />Whether or not you are religious, there is a tremendous amount to think about in this small 143-page book. It has been my experience in working with people as they confront their fears (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco) that we humans are very inclined to abandon our expressed value systems when we feel deeply threatened. The courageous among us are those who do not let go of what we believe when the rubber meets the road or something hits the fan. <br />Religions for Peace can help us be those courageous people.	2002-03-10

As a psychotherapist and writer dealing with fear from a psychological perspective (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco 2002), I am delighted to discover Pema Chodron, an author who both supports and challenges my beliefs from a spiritual point of view. <br />Chodron speaks directly and clearly to our hearts, but never fails to attend to our minds in this thoroughly enjoyable and immensely helpful book. She goes beyond teaching us what it means to be brave; she shows us how to make courage a daily practice. I am especially impressed with what Chodron has to say about the value of moving toward (rather than hiding from) what scares us. She validates what I have experienced --- professionally and personally --- time and again: that fear is a tremendous teacher. <br />And last but certainly not least: if an excellent sense of humor is really a sign of intelligence, this woman is brilliant.	2002-02-09

These 20 years later, reading The Gift of Therapy, I am reminded that I made an excellent choice.<br />Irv Yalom's \\"open letter to a new generation of therapists and their patients\\" speaks to three essential aspects of myself: the psychotherapist, the human being, and the writer.<br />As a psychotherapist I am validated for thinking outside the traditional boxes and challenged to keep learning with every client I see. Yalom offers everything from specific suggested questions to ask clients to the wisdom of his experience such as \\"therapy should not be theory-driven, but relationship-driven,\\" and \\"though the physicality of death destroys us, the idea of death can save us.\\"<br />As a human being I am reminded that there is seldom --- if ever --- only one valid explanation for how we become who we are. And I am enlightened by Yalom's reminder of Paul Tilich's list of four \\"ultimate concerns\\" --- death, isolation, meaning, and freedom.<br />As a writer I am thoroughly entertained by how Yalom puts a sentence together. For instance, speaking of the importance of dream interpretation in therapy, he writes, \\"Pillage and loot the dream, take out of it whatever seems valuable, and don't fret about the discarded shell.\\"<br />Most of all, as I close my now well-worn, underlined and dog-eared copy of Irv Yalom's new book, I am inspired by the man and the psychotherapist who has been, and remains, a hero of mine. (I suppose Irv would consider that literary transference.)<br />Bottomline: great book for therapists and non-therapists alike.	2002-01-28

If you are ready to pay attention, and I mean really pay attention, The Axemaker's Gift will alter your perception of the world --- specifically humankind's relationship to the natural world --- forever. In the relatively few pages of this book, James Burke and Robert Ornstein take us on a journey from humankind's beginning to present day, maintaining all along the way their metaphor of the double-edged axe (Every advance has a price).<br />Books like The Axemaker's Gift (New World, New Mind by Ornstein and Paul Erlich is another) go beyond interesting reading. This material is important. We need to read it; we need to think carefully about it; and we need to act on the sharp (pun intended) insights provided.<br />The subject matter is essential, the point of view realistic, even if a little dark, and the authors make The Axemaker's Gift an interesting and enjoyable read. As a non-fiction author, I am always impressed with the ability to make serious matters fun, without losing the message.<br />My recommendation: read it, enjoy it, learn from it.	2002-01-19

As a psychotherapist and author who writes about facing fear (Embracing Fear, HarperSanFrancisco 2002), I am happy to see Gavin DeBecker's intelligent and realistic message being spread throughout our (now more than ever) fearful world. <br />The emotion of fear cries out for reassurance, but reassurance can be effective only when it is credible. We all know there are no guarantees. And since we cannot see into the future, clear-headed intelligence and well-researched material like you will find in Fear Less is the best reassurance there is.	2002-01-07

As a psychotherapist, and recepient of plenty of psychotherapy myself, I can testify to the power of fear. Track any emotional difficulty to its core and your will find fear. Track any fear to its core and you will find the fear of death. Fear cries out for reassurance, but not just any reassurance will do --- we need credible reassurance.<br />To my knowledge, no one has solved the great mystery of the afterlife with absolute, undeniable credibility, and until that happens we have to use our own good judgment about whom we can trust on this essential subject. I trust Lily Fairchilde. I have worked with her personally on many occasions over the past 20 years, and have never found reason to doubt that she is the real deal. Lily is definitely unique; I think maybe half human and half spirit guide.<br />And Voices from the Afterlife is a beautifully written, highly credible reassurance for people like me, who are definitely human and who need continued reassurance that life goes on. Thanks, Lily, for the Serenity you have given me.	2001-12-01

The Will of God was written in 1944, but remains relevant today for anyone interested in a God that is more than an oversimplified, superstitious way to avoid the pain associated with the hard realities of life. \\"These are days full of loss and pain, of suffering and sorrow. But they are not days of waste,\\" the Reverend Leslie Weatherhead tells us. <br />This little book ---- only 85 pages --- offers a simple but powerful way to reconcile genuine faith with thoughtful intelligence. Since it is our response to the circumstances of life, rather than the circumstances themselves, that determine whether or not these are \\"days of waste,\\" Reverend Weatherhead's paradigm for understanding the relationship between God's will and man's will is a valuable tool to help us improve the quality of that response in the face of everything from the catastrophic to the most mundane of circumstances.<br />The five chapters of The Will of God were originally five sermons written and delivered by Reverend Weatherhead, but it is not necessary to be a Christian to benefit from the wisdom here. In fact, there is nothing evangelical about the book. It is a lesson in practical spirituality, applicable to us all, and it will be as relevant in another sixty years as it is today. <br />I suggest buying several copies at once to save on shipping --- you will want to share this one.	2001-11-18

Kent Nerburn's books are always filled with intelligence and compassion, and \\"Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace\\" is an excellent example of just how much head and heart can be beautifully installed into 129 pages. Nerburn's reflections on the Prayer of Saint Francis teach us more about ourselves than about the famous saint, and that is probably just fine with Francis.<br />Nerburn always emphasizes the practical. \\"I would rather try to manifest my belief in God than to profess it,\\" he writes. In this way, Saint Francis and the self-admitted not-so-saintly Nerburn make a wonderful team. They teach us that we cannot successfully hide from the dark side of our world or of ourselves; that instead we must face even the \\"most frightening human emotion\\" --- hatred --- head on. The goal is not to become a saint, thank goodness, but to accept responsibility to do what we can to manifest, and not just profess, our own beliefs. <br />Congruent with its contents, the physical book itself makes an excellent gift. I keep several copies in my office to give away whenever I may be so moved --- by the spirit of Saint Francis perhaps. (Although I doubt that Francis is involved in book promotion)	2001-10-28

Both the fan of magic and the psychotherapist in me read Houdini's Box ---- with our feet propped up on the back porch railing, on a September Sunday afternoon. <br />The psychotherapist in me respects Adam Phillips' way of provoking thought without claiming any corner on &quot;the truth.&quot; (If you like being introspective about the human psyche, this is a good one.) But mostly, the fan of magic enjoyed Phillips' take on Harry Houdini. There is little doubt that Houdini would be proud to be receiving so much attention 75 years after his death, but I think he would especially like becoming an archetype for the human condition.<br />If your taste runs toward mixing introspection with entertainment, and if you are curious to discover what you may have in common with &quot;the great mystifyer,&quot; the two of me definitely recommend this book.	2001-09-09

It is difficult to imagine, but The Dance is even better than The Invitation. With her unique blend of beautiful language and down-to-earth wisdom, Oriah Mountain Dreamer takes us to the next logical, post-invitation step: action. &quot;Don't just say 'yes' to my invitation,&quot; Oriah tells us, &quot;. . . take my hand and dance with me.&quot; The Dance is about active spirituality, about putting our dance steps where our mouths are. And as with The Invitation, Oriah Mountain Dreamer leads us along this path by taking her turn at vulnerability first. She leads by example, and she is a beautiful, perfectly imperfect example of what humanity can be. The Dance offers fresh perspectives (&quot;I believe that the big picture is somehow shaped by how we live the details, the little pictures that run through our lives.&quot;), and wise counsel (&quot;If you need to be afraid, fear will come wherever you are, but you don't have to go out looking for it.&quot;), and it confronts the dangers of oversimplified, sugar-coated self-help recipes. (&quot;Guaranteed outcomes and delineated steps may be warranted and useful for baking cookies and assembling bookshelves, but I find them less useful and potentially misleading when we are talking about finding meaning and creating happiness in our own lives and in the world.&quot;) As a psychotherapist, as an author, and as a human being, I have found a kindred, anti-namby-pamby spirit in Oriah Mountain Dreamer. Reading The Invitation is not a prerequisite for reading The Dance, but I can't think of a better way to spend your reading time than to read these two babies back to back. I said that it is difficult to imagine that The Dance is better than The Invitation, but you don't have to rely on imagination. Reading is believing.	2001-08-28
