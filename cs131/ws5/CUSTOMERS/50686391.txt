I have to admit that I am a HUGE fan of VI Warshawski, I love her tough-as-nails outlook on life, but still has a soft heart. She is a damn good investigator, street fighter and has a mouth on her that would make guys blush, she is a tougher version of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, and all VI's stories have a great element of humor in them too...<br />This time, VI is investigating the death of her cousin Boom Boom, who used to work in Chicago's shipping industry. Boom Boom has seemed to have drowned, but VI is convinced her cousin was murdered and spends her time trying to uncover secrets down in the shipyards. <br />Even though the story is good, it really isn't enough to keep me interested. I did finish the book, but there are many other VI stories out there are much better and much more fast-paced than this little sleeper.<br />Ok, if you are a VI fan and you want to read the series, otherwise choose another one.	2001-05-02

How does a young, struggling, single mum receive $200,000 in the post? How are these two events and people related? And how does this make for a sensational book?

After a few strange happenings and feelings, she is diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, a crippling disease that eventually is fatal.<br />Her husband, feeling guilty, returns home to help her and look after his teenage daughter. Basically, this book is very thin on plot, but it isn;t the plot that makes this story interesting, it is the three main characters, that make this book unforgettable and un-put-down-able! <br />Even though the story rushes toward a tragic ending, it is the emotion, psychology and dialogue that will have the reader glued to the book. <br />I definately recommend this book if you are after something that will stay with you and is superbly written.<br />Well done, Ms Fielding!	2001-05-02

Although Sidney Sheldon is a millionaire from this style of writing, I didn't think that he was such a bad writer. I tried a couple of his books when I was 17, thought they were ok, and tried this one 10 yrs later, what a waste of paper!<br />I am aware that Sheldon has to put the gorgeous young bimbette as the heroine, but this one takes the cake. Dana Evans is a sensational TV journalist (she is probably all of 14) and has just recently acquired a young orphan boy from his war-torn country. Over the past few yrs, a very wealthy and famous family has had its members taken out, in different, but tragic circumstances and Dana, being the clever vixen that she is, is the first person to see that there might be a link.<br />So Dana sets out with her man Jeff (equally as young, successful and gorgeous) and crosses different countries trying to figure out what is going on with the famous Winthrop family, meanwhile Jeff is playing doctor and nurse with his ex-wife (a model, of course!) who has fallen tragically ill and while Dana is jettsetting, she fails to realise that her poor orphan boy, who is a model for ADD kiddies everywhere, has suddenly become very placid, polite and downright lovely young man, when left in the hands of the babysitter!!!!! <br />This is such a bad bad novel, but it would make a good made-for-TV thing that would be on a Tues night, but I don't think that I would be watching it!<br />I am surprised that there are people out there that like this book and what is even more surprising is that Mr Sheldon has made squillions from writing crap like this, oh well, I suppose there is hope for all budding writers.	2001-05-01

Please leave the Stephen King-esque story lines to Stephen King.<br />I was eagerly awaiting this book by the brilliant Mr Lehane and when I read the back cover, I realised it wasn't about his usual suspects - Angie &amp; Patrick, but I figured, it is still a Lehane, it's got to be good, right?<br />WRONG! This book is so boring, I only finished it because it was written by Lehane, but basically the story involves 3 boys who grew up together - Dave, Sean and Jimmy. After a good opening, Dave gets into a car and disappears for a few days, when he finally returns, his disappearance is not dealt with and we fast forward to 25 years later where Sean is a cop, Jimmy owns a store but has done a stint in prison and Dave is trying to deal with what happened to hiim 25 years ago.<br />Now, the premise is great but this is the sort of thing that King would write and do it 50x better. It could have been good, it could have been great but it wasn't, there are too many questions, not enough answers, a very weak ending and it is basically a very boring book.<br />If you are after excellent Lehane, do yourself a favour and try anything else he has written!	2001-05-01

Years before, Shana &amp; Lily were raped and although the rapist was found and jailed, he is out again and on the war-path, stalking Shana (as he knows where she lives!) <br />Lily is coming to terms with protecting her daughter and rekindling the romance that she has with another defence lawyer, Richard.<br />Basically, Lily, Shana, Richard and John (her ex) are very annoying people. Ms Rosenberg has made everyone very 1 dimensional and there are too many questions. If Lily &amp; Shana were both raped by the same man &amp; there he is still stalking them, would you send your daughter off to stay at a friends house (that she barely knows ) so Lily could get some nooky with Richard? Sounds like a great parent! If the rapist is stalking Shana, wouldn't you move out of the same house???? <br />Sorry, Ms Rosenberg, I felt this is was just an attempt to cash in on a tired theme. <br />Overall, this is a very average book that will keep you entertained for the time that you are reading it. Don't expect it to be brilliant like anything from Michael Connelly (excellent crime author) but it will give you something to do.	2001-02-18

This book is no exception. <br />Peter (LAPD) &amp; Rina Decker are on their honeymoon in Rina's hometown, so the references to Orthodox Jews are virtually the book on its own. While Peter is grappelling with Judasim and all its words (that for a non-Jew, gets very frustrating at times) he seems to be also be searching for a runaway teenage boy &amp; here is where the story starts to get interesting. The boy (Noam) is his half-nephew who has seemed to have hooked up with another teenage pyscho who likes filleting gay men. So, Peter, has to spend his honeymoon looking for Noam and his friend, Hersh. <br />Bascially, the entire book is about Peter's search for Noam, Hersh, his r'ship with his wife, her family, his struggle with the religion and his first meeting with his 'real' other. <br />Unfortunately, Kellerman spends way too long on the Judaism and not enough on the actual story &amp; I had read books from her that don't involve Rina, and they are fantastic!<br />Overall this is an ok book. If you are looking for great crime fiction, then look towards Michael Connelly or John Sandford but if you are looking for light crime with a heavy dash of religion, then this is the book for you!	2001-02-18

In the mist of my collection of serial killers, crime, suspense and political thrillers, I manage to pick up one of those wonderful, beautiful books, that leave you breathless and begging for more when it finishes.<br />I absolutely loved this book by Jodi Picoult. Faith is a 7 yo girl that is having a very tough time going through her parents divorce. She calls upon her imaginery friend 'Guard' to help her through it. She is actually calling God and seeing her - yes, her! Through a number of miracles and other examples of Faith and her God, the media comes to town, bringing with it, believers, those who want to be healed, TV athiests and of course, reps from Rome. <br />This is not just a book about Faith and whether God actually exists or not, it is cleverly entwined with Mariah &amp; Colin (Faith's parents) and they deal with the fact that their 7yo daughter might or might not be a visionary plus the fact they are divorcing and who gets custody of their little miraculous daughter.<br />This book is so much more than what I can describe in a review, it is beautifully and cleverly written, the characters are wonderful and you want to keep reading just to see what happens next to Faith and her 'family'. This has definately got to be one of the best books that I have read for a very long time (that isn't a thriller) and I highly recommend it!!	2001-01-26

Kerry had never liked the idea of getting involved in politocs, but after a number of years as a lawyer, plus the fact the public loved his brother, he is thrust into the world of politics and the media.<br />This is basically a story of political backstabbing, affaires, murder and what can happen when 1 mistake can ruin your whole life as well as many other peoples along the way. <br />I have to admit that this is probably one of the best political thirller I have read in a very long time and I usually steer well-clear of anything with the US govt or army, but this one from Patterson is nothing short of sensational!<br />Highly recommended if you like easy-to-read thrillers but one that are written beautifully, really explore their characters PLUS keep you on the edge of your seat!	2001-01-22

This book kept me enthralled from the very first page and would let go. <br />Lt Col Jon Smith (USAMRIID) is trying to investigate the death of his beloved Dr Sophia Russell, who was killed after doing some detective work on a very rare virus that seemed to be kiliing random people across the world. This virus had Ebola-type symptoms and after Sophia goes digging into what sort of virus it is and where it comes from, somebody thinks she is better off dead. <br />Smith enlists the help of 2 friends to uncover a myriad of missing documents, doors slammed shut and unethical scientists that seem to love making terrible viruses and trying them out to see what would happen, but the question is why??<br />I thought this was a sensational read, not too heavy and very well written. Being a research biochemist myself, I love the way Ludlum incorporated todays technology into a suspense thriller that was able to keep me up all night! Excllent piece of fiction, Mr Ludlum, I will definately be reading everything else that you have written!<br />Highly recommended!	2001-01-22

He encounters a vet, Frannie, who spots a young girl on the side of the road..and she has wings and can fly! Basically, the rest of the story is trying to find out where she has come from and who/what are doing these sorts of experiments. I had guessed the ending well into the book, so it really wasn't a surprise for me, but overall, the plot was not that great, esp considering JP introduced me to Gary Soneji and Det Alex Cross!<br />Overall, I was disappointed with this book from Patterson, although he is an excellent writer, I really do believe that he should stick to real thrillers with Alex Cross and let the suspense/horror to Stephen King or Dean Koontz.<br />If you are a fan of JP, then you will be disappointed but this is a fast-read (short chapters) and it will keep you entertained for a least a couple of hours, otherwise re-read 'Kiss the Girls'.	2001-01-18

I am starting to think that if the book doesn't have Alex Cross in it, then it is going to be boring, which this one was..<br />The offering from JP has the main characters, a cop 'Stef', in a wheelchair. He was put there trying to kill a major mafia/drug lord that he had been chasing for 2 years and unfortunately for him, the guy got to him first. Fast forward 2 years later, the cop enlists the help of a young policewomen to track down a killer who is going around killing memebers of the 'Midnight Club' a club whose members include heavy players from around the world and whose head-honcho was the drug lord that Stef has spent a large part of his life trying to put away. <br />From the beginning, I thought that this had shards of Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme, but luckily, Stef is nowhere near as annoying but still the story is SOOOO SLOOOOOOWWWWWW that it really doesn't go anywhere at all and I dumped it 3/4 of the way through as I really didn't care if Stef and his girl lived, died, figured it out or not, all I knew is that I wanted to get rid of 'The Midnight Club' asap.<br />I ama huge fan of JP's work and I am constantly amazed on how well he can write esp with so many different chacters, he doesn't rely on one main character to write about, but maybe he should stick to it, as 'The Midnight Club' is probably the worst JP book I have read....<br />Disappointing.	2001-01-18

Ok, I have to admit that this was not like 'Kiss the Girls' or 'Along Came a Spider' but it was definately an excellent book with one of my fav characters - Det Alex Cross.<br />I can't get over how brilliantly JP can write - esp through the eyes of his characters who happen to be African-American men, battered wives etc - he always seems to know exactly how to portray them, sometimes I think he must have ghost writers!<br />Anyway, 'Jack &amp; Jill' is basically about a couple that are going around the streets of NY and killing famous women and men, for reasons the reader is not sure about and neither is the NYPD, therefore making the profiling very difficult. Along side these very gruesome murders are the murders of young children and Alex Cross and co and trying to figure out if they are connected or not, if so, why. Luckily for the reader, you get into the lives of the killers, so YOU know who-dun-it but you just have to wait for Alex to catch up! As per usual, JP gives the reader great twists and turns throughout the story which keeps you on your toes but luckily, with the short chapters, you want to keep reading just one more...<br />I highly recommend 'Jack &amp; Jill' for an explosive thriller - it will keep you up all night!	2001-01-18

I absolutely loved this offering from Pearson and I was expecting it to be bad as I really didn't like 'Undercurrents' at all.<br />The opening scene is horrific - young policewoman gets bashed and ends up paralysed, she can only move her eyes. Enter Lou Boldt, excellent cop &amp; detective investigating a string of home robberies and trying to tie them together with the assalt on the young policewoman plus a few other policemen along the way.<br />I love the excellent, believable characters that Pearson has given us. Boldt is in the same league as Alex Cross (James Patterson) and Harry Bosch (Michael Connelly) - excellent detectives that love to make their own rules, but aren't know-it-alls as it still takes a while to piece all of the info together and catch the killer.<br />This is a sensational book from Pearson and I just might have to re-read 'Undercurrents' now...<br />Highly recommended if you like your crime fiction with a twist of suspense and your heart racing!	2001-01-14

The opening prologue was good - two young virgins pregnant and about to give birth, both saying the births will be miracle births..but that is about as believable and interesting as the story gets!<br />I have to admit that I love the fact that Patterson writes very short chapters, if it wasn't for that, I would have dumped the book ages ago so I actually did finish it within a couple of hours, but it was a terrible book. The plot was pathetic, the characters were wooden and very silly and overall, I was very very very disappointed with this lastest book from Patterson.<br />If you a big Alex Cross fan or just love anything from JP, leave this book on the shelf and if you want good vs evil, get Stephen King!	2001-01-14

This has got to be the 2nd JP book that I have hated so much that I had to put it down halfway through, I never ever ever do that to JP! <br />Although I was looking forward to reading about the Jews, Nazis, Hilter, this book was so unbelievably boring that I did not care about what was going to happen to Alix or any of the silly characters. <br />I did not know that this was written in the 70's, before his success with Alex Cross, if I had known that, I would never have bothered to pick it up.<br />Please, if you are looking for the suspense-filled, action packed, twists and turns at every moment, usual JP books, this do yourself a favour and DO NOT READ THIS ONE! <br />Thank goodness for Alex Cross!	2001-01-07

I throughly enjoyed this offering from Faye Kellerman even though I had given up on Stalker just days before.<br />Peter Decker is a great cop that gets the job done but along side his career is his family as an instant dad when he married a woman with 2 sons. Families don't get mentioned much in suspense novels unless the families have been hacked to death by the serial killer in the book, or about to be! But, this one, Faye introduces the reader to the Jewish faith (which I know nothing about but loved reading about it) without being condesending or too informative. <br />Jupiters Bones is about a scientist-turned-cult-leader who is found dead at his cult, but was he murdered? And if so, why? And who by? Of course, this is a classic 'whodunnit' but it is very entertaining and cleverly written, with the reader trying to figure out who out the silly named characters could of killed old Jupiter. <br />I enjoyed Jupiters Bones and I am glad that I gave this Kellerman another chance after 'Stalker'. This is not quite in the realm of Michael Connelly or James Patterson, but it still is a good book. My only complaint - why why why do any cult books always have to end the same???	2001-01-07

Ok Ok, so this doesn't have the sensational Detective Cross, but it is still one hell of a brilliant story by James! As much as I love Cross and his band of men, I have to admit that James can still write excellent suspense novels without the help of his famous and very goodlooking(!) Alex Cross!<br />This is a story about Maggie Bradford, a famous singer, who is in an abusive marriage - two infact - and how she deals with them. I thought that although this was not quite the fastpaced, action-packed &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; or &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; it was still and enjoyable book that left me wanting more. A definate plus on JP's side is the fact that he has such short chapters which makes you want to read more, and before you know it, you are off to get another JP book before you suffer from withdrawal symptoms.<br />If you are looking for a crime novel like &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; then you will be disappointed but if you are looking for something from James Patterson that is still easy to read and keeps you up all night trying to finish it, then you will love &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;.	2001-01-07

This was quite a enjoyable book that was basically about 2 women who are with the same man, one as his wife (Slyvie)and one as his mistress (Marla)- both look the same only the wife looks 10 yrs older. Marlahas always wanted to be his wife and Slyvie wants to be his mistress, so they change themselves a bit and viola! swap places without the hapless man knowing anything about it..<br />Although this story asks you to suspend belief, as it is unrealistic in places, plus the main man is definately not the brightest fellow, it is still cute and worth reading if you have a Sunday afternoon free and you don't want a 'heavy' book.	2001-01-07

Reluctently,Chase agrees and soon finds himself falling for one of the most beautiful women in the world, Sienna. Unfortunately for Chase and Sienna, her husband happens to be a illegal arms merchant who is quite happy killing anything that looks at him the wrong way. <br />There is much more to this fast paced story, but I don't want to give it away. I have never read anything by Morrell before but I love crime/suspense novels that keep you up all night and this one certainly did. I highly recommend 'Burnt Sienna' - it is different that the usual suspense thrillers out there but will still keep you on the edge of your seat!	2001-01-07

But, in true Connelly style, murders are not what they seem and soon Bosch is actually investigating robberies that are somehow connected to his dead friend. <br />What I love the most about Bosch is that he is such a tough detective, that you can't help but love him and the millions of times, he gets thrown off cases for being too damn good. <br />Connelly is an excellent writer and although this is not quite as good as &quot;The Poet&quot; or &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot;, it is still a brilliant book for his second time. I love &quot;The Black Echo&quot; as it kept me up all night just piecing everything together and wondering what happens next and who else is involved...<br />Excellent work from an excellent author!	2001-01-07

Let me count the ways..Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls, Hide and Seek, Cat and Mouse - I am just about to start Roses are Red!<br />I thought that this was one of the best books that Patterson has written. I loved the re-introduction of Gary Soneji as everyone's favourite psycho serial killer, I love the fact that Alex Cross is such a sensational detective, I loved the story - as one killer is caught and killed another is on the hunt (and somehow JP blends them beautifully together).<br />But, I think the main reason that I love JP's work is the so very fast paced action and dialogue. The fact that Sampson and Cross are brilliant detectives but quite unlike Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme where he knows EVERTHING just by looking at a blade of grass. I love thrillers that keep you turning the pages because you WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT and with his excellent concept of short chapters, you cannot put this one down! <br />I loved Cat &amp; Mouse for the heart-stopping twists and turns, excellent characters, brilliant storyline and damn fine writing style. If you are looking for a serious crime thriller, that will only take you a day to read as you will not be able to put it down, then definately get Cat &amp; Mouse, you will not be disappointed!	2001-01-07

I picked up this book months ago and gave it away as it just didn't grab me, but I decided to give it another try considering I enjoy books written by Deaver, even though his main characters always know WAY too much than the average detective.<br />I was really very surprised on how much I really enjoyed this book. The 'Coffin Dancer' is a contract killer who is hunting down 3 people and Lincoln Rhyme, an excellent forensic cop, is trying to find him and WHY he is killing these innocent people at the same time trying to keep them safe as the Coffin Dancer is one sure psycho who is always one step ahead of Rhyme, even though Rhyme can work out exactly what happened at a crime scene even though he has only seen 1 speck of blood..sometimes his powers of deduction are way behind belief.<br />Overall, this is an excellent thriller, well above the average 'whodunits' as it throws in many unexpected twists and turns but still believable enough to enjoy.

I was looking forward to some short stories so I could read quickly in my lunch break but after skimming through the first 3 pages and then trying to read about a dying AIDS patient and finally settling on a story about a girl who was so fat that she was shocked when someone wanted to marry her and then he took off when she decided to lose weight (sorry to spoil that ending, but that is as good as it gets!)..I knew that I could not continue reading such boring drivel. What was the point of these stories? I have no idea, except maybe to cure insommnia.<br />PLEASE do yourself a BIG favour and DO NOT get this book!	2000-12-18

The opening of the book is brilliant - a little girl (Amanda) is caught in a strange storm and goes off into the woods. The rest of the book is about Lonnie Blake, a musician, who helps out a prositute (Carol Dodson) one night and eventually falls for her. But Carol is hiding her daughter, Amanda, from many people, for reasons that are apparent throughout the story and Lonnie helps out both of them.<br />I was disappointed with this book, it was hardly exciting plus by the end of it I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters, I pushed myself to finish it, but the ending was no surprise.<br />Not recommended if you are after an excellent thriller, bypass this one and head on over to anything by Dennis Lehane or Michael Connelly.	2000-12-18

A mother with a baby gets carjacked and it seems that carjackings are on the increase in LA and the LAPD are trying to link them together. Enter Cindy Decker, a young rookie cop, whose dad is a detective on the force, and she a graduate of one of the country's top colleges, you would think with that background she would be quite intelligent..wrong!<br />I have never read Faye Kellerman and after not being impressed with Johnathon Kellerman, I thought that I would try Faye anyway. I should have listened to my instincts....The opening is great and you learn into the book that Cindy is being trailed for some unknown reason. But about halfway into the story, I realised that Cindy is not a bright spark, does ridiculous things for a 26 yo woman who is being trailed plus eventually you really do not care why someone is after her or who that is. <br />I got to the last 20 pages or so hoping it would get better, but I was wrong - I couldn't finish it as I really was not interested in anything else but finding a better book to read. I don't think that I will be getting another of Kellerman's books if this is what they are like, thank goodness I never actually bought it!<br />If you are looking for excellent thrillers try anything at all from James Patterson or Michael Connelly..you will not be disappointed , unlike this book.	2000-12-18

For a lover of crime fiction, this has got to one of the best books around that is definately not crime! I could not put this book down, I was even reading this at work! It was a very long book (800+ pages) but believe me, you will not notice it as you will just wanting to read one more chapter...<br />This book is a real eye-opener into the beloved world of Hollywood and L.A. Even though this is a fiction book, you can't help but wonder if that what REALLY goes on in Tinsel Town (and I am SURE that it does!). <br />This centres around the lives of three young actresses - Jahne Moore, Lila Kyle and Sharleen Smith, each with their own style, each trying to make it big in Hollywood, each with their own problems and secrets. I am definately not into books by Jackie Collins etc but this was one trashy, hilarious, sexy, excellent book that has a serious undertone and an insight into the false world of the entertainment industry.<br />If you REALLY want to know what goes on 'behind the scenes' with all your favourite actors, producers and directors or if you just love a wickedly funny, trashy book, then definately do yourself a favour..pick this up, have a couple of days off work and READ IT!!!	2000-12-11

But, I know that the 'Three Blond Mice' weren't quite the age of the Goldern Girls, but Bea Arthur makes a terrific Elaine.<br />This is a very light-hearted story of three friends who, every year, go on a holiday, and this yr they have chosen to go on a cruise. Basically, the three middle-aged women have ex-husbands and they just want to get away from life for a while but the opening of the story introduces the reader to the fact that one of the women are going to get killed, commissioned by her ex-husband. The rest of the story is really about the three women, the men that they meet and of course, finding the killer before it is too late.<br />This is a very easy to read book, but I found that it wasn't very exciting and it nothing really happened. I really did conjure up Bea Arthur on The Love Boat, and if you liked those two shows, then you will love this book. Personally, I thought that 'Infernal Affairs' was much better and quite funny, where this is quite flat and uninteresting. Unless you are a huge fan of Jane Hellar, don't bother with this one.	2000-12-06

I loved 'Along Came a Spider' and this was just as good. <br />Det Alex Cross is now after British Intelligence resident psycho Geoffrey Shafer, who loves playing computer games, but in real life. He hunts down women and kills them just so he can tell his fellow gameplayers that he is Death. The women that he selects are random and so Cross and his colleagues are finding it hard to piece this puzzle together. But the game suddenly turns personal for Cross and he must end it before there are dire consequences.<br />Thankfully, Patterson introduces us to the killer early into the story and so we can follow Shafer's warped mind and the cops that are trying to catch him. Patterson also takes this story over a couple of months, even years, which is different to the usual crime fiction, where even the most cunning and intelligent serial killers get caught within a couple of weeks of their horrific crime.<br />I highly recommend 'Pop Goes the Weasel' as each chapter is only a few pages long and you want to read just one more...	2000-12-04

This book grabbed me right from the beginning and never let me go! This is a story that revolves around the murder of wife and mother and her husband confesses to killng her...but early on in the piece the reader discovers that he didn't do it and he is trying to protect the killer. But does he know the real story? Why has he hired such an inexperienced lawyer who has never dealt with murder trials before? <br />Moment of Truth is one of the best crime novels I have read for ages - it is extremely entertaining and has so many twists and turns that you don't see them BUT they all make sense!! And the killer is not a rogue cop - amazing! Luckily, the reader knows who the killer is early into the story but the way that Ms Scottaline's unravels the rest is her real strength, keeping it with excellent characters with strong family values.<br />I wil definately be getting more of Ms Scottaline's novels, she is an excellent author and this book will keep you up all night!	2000-12-03

This is my first Jane Heller book and being a fan of Olivia Goldsmith, I was tempted to try something from JH. Well, I was certainly not disappointed! This is a very 'light' read but it is laugh-out-loud hilarious and exactly what I was looking for after a few heavy crime novels, that I had been reading. <br />This is a great story about a very depressed woman who basically makes a deal with the devil to get everything she wants out of life. But of course this is a dangerous pact and she learns to deal with it as best as she can throughout the rest of the book. <br />If you are looking for something to keep you laughing and very entertained for a few hrs, then pick this up, you will not be disappointed!!	2000-12-03

'Red Leaves' was bad enough but this is terrible, I could have written better myself. For those of you who are expecting another 'Tully', you will be sorely disappointed. This is basically a story about preganant Didi (ready to give birth) who gets kidnapped by a young man in a shopping centre. For the next 11 or so hrs, he takes her for a drive, killing a few people along the way and the reader tries to work out WHY he took HER. But towards the end of the book, it is clear why and I am amazed it takes Didi so long to work it out. Meanwhile, her frantic husband teams up with the FBI to locate his missing wife and strangely enough, the distraught husband seems to know exactly where this psycho has taken her, but the FBI, don't have much of an idea. Didi, in the meantime, is trying to work out her kidnapper, pretend she is not in labour (she doesn't want him to know - can you hide that???) and reason her kidnapping with the Almighty.<br />I am sorry Ms Simons, but this is truly a very badly written book, the characters are terrible and the plot is totally unbelievable. The ending, with a lovely bow tied around religious reasons, as to why her kidnapping took place is so disappointing, I couldn't wait to finally finish this book.<br />If you want GOOD crime fiction, with excellent characters and real page-turners, try ANYTHING from Michael Connolley or Dennis Lehane.	2000-11-27

This story revolves around an excellent fashion designer Karen Kahn, who after many years in the aggressive and competetive fashio world, has finally received golden honours. She has a loving husband, wonderful working environs and a dysfunctional but entertaining family, so why is she still unhappy? Karen would love to concieve a child but cannot, plus she was adopted when she was very young, so this really is a story about Karen finding out who she is and what she wants out of life. But, this is not a heavy finding-yourself book, it is a very entertaining and easy to read book that will have you laughing, crying or hurling the book across the room, depending on the bit you are reading!! <br />I really enjoyed 'Young Wives Club' and 'Bestseller' and this is up there with those two books. I cannot wait to get OS next book as they are all brilliant esp if you are looking for entertaining books to keep you happy over the weekend!<br />Highly recommended!	2000-11-27
US	50686391	R1XYZY4PRJ0RAR	0061095540	984341135	Marrying Mom	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Average from Goldsmith	I certainly didn't enjoy this as much as I did Bestseller or Young Wives Club, but it was still an ok read. This is a story about 3 siblings who are not very impressed that their widowed mum is leaving Florida and coming to live with them in NY. She is loud, brash, aggressive, strong-minded and always sticks her nose into places where they don't belong. The three decide to set up Operation Geezer Quest, a plan to get their mum to marry and old, rich man so she can be looked after..well away from them. Basically, the story goes on about how this mission is accomplished but at the same time bringing the family closer together. <br />It is quite a funny book and it is short so you can finish it in one sitting. It is entertaining and cleverly written but it is nowhere near as good as other Goldsmith's books - still a good book to read if you have a few hours to kill.	2000-11-17

I enjoy excellent crime fiction in the likes of Michael Connolley or Dennis Lehane but this one from Franscell was very average and I guessed the killer quite early on. <br />Basically this book is about a newspaper editor that comes back to the small town that he grew up in. While he is there, he decides to take on the wish of a dying man convicted of a murder he didn't committ. Naturally, being in a small town, the townspeople are not happy with him dredging up the past in order to find the killer of a murder that happened more than 30 yrs ago especially when everyone in the town has 'secrets' which they don't want to be uncovered.<br />I find this book to be very cliched and everything happens exactly how you expect it to - editor &amp; his perfect wife are victimised, he finds out the truth just moments before the old man dies etc.<br />This was not an exciting or enthralling book, it does not keep you guessing or keep you page-turning..I just wanted to finish it and I did - unfortunately.	2000-11-17

I really thought that the opening of this book was great - Indian girl gets raped by prominent politician and her Indian brothers try and get revenge &amp; this is basically what the book is about. The first 50 pages or so are really good - American Indian going around killing 'innocent' people with a large blade, police trying to track him down. But after a while, the story gets really quite boring and soon you are really not interested if they get their man. As much as I love Lucas Davenport, I am really not impressed with Sandford, I keep hoping that I will find another Mind Prey, but this certainly wasn't it...	2000-11-13

I don't think that there is any other writer quite like Crais and his excellent characters Elvis Cole &amp; Joe Pike. If you like great thrillers that are humorous but keep you entertained and guessing throughout the whole story, then you will love The Monkeys Raincoat. Somehow, Crais is able to depict his characters so lifelike that you can actually imagine all the scenes, especially those with the high body counts!<br />This is the 2nd Crais novel (with Elvis) that I have read &amp; I couldn't put it down!

Goldsmith is a wonderful writer who lets the reader take a look of what it is like in the world of writing &amp; publishing and what it takes stay on top! Goldsmith made all her characters come to life from the staff at Dash &amp; Davis to all the writers trying to get their book published. It is an eye-opener for those who knlow nothing about this world and for those who do, realise how on the mark Goldsmith is.<br />I enjoyed Bestseller so much so, I could not put it down at any point. The writing is great, the scenes made me laugh and wonder 'who' she was actually writing about!<br />I will definately be getting another book by Goldsmith and this one was worth every cent.	2000-11-06

I waited SO LONG for this book to finally get into my hands that I thought 'this has got to be great' and I was not disappointed! The thing that I like most about Connelly is the way he can write excellent crime thrillers without having to rely on one character throughout his books. I do love Harry Bosch but Connelly is such a talented writer that every book of his is better than the last, Bosch or no Bosch!<br />'The Poet' centers around the apparent suicide of a cop, Sean,  who has left behind a note that is written on his windshield, it is a line from an Edgar Allen Poe poem, and nobody can quite figure it out. Enter his brother, Jack, a reporter, who is convinced that his brother definately did not committ suicide and soon learns of other cops that died exactly the same way.<br />Jack gets involved with the FBI and soon everybody his trying to hunt down 'The Poet'. With insight into the killers mind &amp; life throughout the book, this makes a truly excellent and riveting read for those who love Connelly's work or love crime fiction. There are a few twists in the ending to keep you the reader guessing and coming back for more Connelly!	2000-10-23

I have never read 'First Wives Club' but I did see it on TV and thought that this was so much better than that movie (thank goodness!) and an excellent, extremely enjoyable book on 3 women who are with horrible husbands and how they try to change their lives. One of the reviews descibed it as 'high quality candy for the mind' and I would definately have to agree! <br />After reading many crime fiction novels, I really needed the lives of Michelle, Jada and Angie to make me laugh out-loud yet still be sad for these women and their idiot husbands. Even though it is a very long book (about 500 pages), I just couldn't put it down as I read about each woman, her life, how true friendships last lifetimes and how to get revenge on your truly idiotic ex! Sensational, funny, sad and poignant reading from a wonderful author who really made a difference to my Saturday.<br />I will definately by getting the next Olivia Goldsmith novel!	2000-10-23

Because she is never tried for her murders, she is kicked out of the FBI and is put in a Witness Protection Program where she is happy living, until she gets an email from Billy Bones, a serial killer who she didn't quite catch the last time.<br />Billy Bones, convinced he is the son of Charles Mason, sends Jay on a wild-goose chase so she can track him down and have her day with him. Billy is an absolute psycho and his character is reminiscent of Dr Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, intelligent and very very scary.<br />The entire book is about Jay tracking down Billy with the obscure clues that he leaves for her. It is actually very cleverly written and it is a different spin on the usual 'whodunits' as the reader knows who done it, and actually gets of insight into the serial killer (not many authors do that).<br />This is a very easy book to read, but it is still an enjoyable thriller that will keep you interested right until the end. Ok, so its not as brilliant as Michael Connelly or Dennis Lehane, but it is still good.	2000-10-17

I have read many of the Prey series and apart from Mind Prey, this is the only one that is actually quite good. <br />This one takes us into the world of modelling and soon enough Davenport is trying to solve the murder of the one of the country's top models. The opening is great- it hooks you in and never lets you go. The body count in this one is quite big and you have to be on your toes if you want to keep up with the story  but it is well worth the wait! <br />Although, I have to admit the ending also left me flat as well ( I would have never has guessed the killer ) and I don't know how Davenport can go from nothing to captured killer is 5 days, but I loved how Sandford kept referring to past books and well as developing more of Davenport and his 'women' - it makes the book entertaining,not just focussing on the crime at hand.<br />I disagree with many of the reviews written here &amp; it takes alot to make me happy! Although Sandford is still not has good as Lehane or Connelly, this one is a good addition to the Prey series (esp when many of the others are boring and not well-written!) Keep this up Sandford &amp; I might actually consider buying some of the Prey series.	2000-10-10

This time Bosch and his crew and investigating the murder of a well-known Hollywood player. He is found in the back of his Rolls , murdered by what looks to be a Mafia hit - or is it? <br />This brilliant novel never loses its way and twists and turns along the way, bringing the reader with it.

But, as usual, things are not always as they seem in Boschs' world and soon is in Mexico, looking for answers that involves drugs and a body count.<br />Bosch is a superb character and Connelly is sensational at developing him and making a brilliant story to go along with it. The reason that I love picking up anything that Connelly has written is that everything he writes is different and extremely entertaining and that is what keeps me coming back for more!<br />If you are sick of the usual 'whodunit's and want thrillers with a twist or few, then pick up The Black Ice or Void Moon, you won't be disappointed!	2000-10-02

This is another excellent offering that brings the reader back into the lives of Patrick and Angie, two PI's, that are so damn good you would definately want them working for you, if they were real!<br />Lehane has excellent character development and such razor-sharp dialogue between all his characters, that you forget that they are not real people. The story goes at break-neck speed and has great twists and turns, that you would never see coming. Apart from all of these sensational aspects, the one thing that Lehane is really good at is introducing humour in this genre. I have never read brilliant thrillers that have a great humour in them as well - probably as good as Janet Evanovich, but with more realistic drama.<br />Sacred is basically about Patrick &amp; Angie being hired by a terminally-ill very rich man looking for his daughter who has disappeared..along with the best PI that money can buy. Patrick &amp; Angie spend their entire time trying to trace both of them, but along the way encounter cults and a high body count.<br />This is not really along the same lines as Lehane's 'Darkness, Take my Hand' or 'Gone Baby Gone', but Lehane has such a high standard that it would be too difficult for him to write 5 star books constantly.<br />If you love crime/thrillers with a bit of humour thrown in along with a dash of the 2 most brilliant PI's that are around, then you will love Sacred!	2000-09-29

Separated mum lawyer in a average cold, snowy town, defending a man on a murder charge who is accused of killing his brother. Not a bad eposide but I hate Family Law and Northern Exposure and I would much prefer to watch The Practise!<br />This book has got to be one of the worst legal 'thrillers' around. Like Family Law, the actual 'law' part takes a backburner to the relationships that actually happening to the main characters. The opening is good - guy sees his brother ski off a cliff and somehow he is wound up charged for murdering his brother, but the rest of the book, is really about Nina Reily (his lawyer) and what is happening in her life when she is taking a break from defending him. One special moment is Nina's marriage to another lawyer, who happens to be the prosecuting DA in the same trial! Funnily enough, the guy on the murder charge is not really happy about this little arrangement, I wonder why? Hello..realism?<br />As you plod through the book, you eventually get to the last 10 pages or so when the story does get a bit more interesting (hence the 2 star rating) but by then you really don't care what happens to anybody and the very last 2 pages is even more unbelievable.<br />I really don't think that I will be reading another book by Perri, I would advise you to do the same unless you like mediocre television shows that don't go anywhere.	2000-09-25

Granted I haven't read them in order, but i read Mind Prey first and I wanted the rest of them to be as brilliant as that one, but slowly, as I pick up yet another Prey book, I get even more disappointed.<br />This one starts brilliantly - excellent opening scenes in (&amp; out) of the courtroom bringing the reader up to speed with the main character Bekker and the guy who is going to get him, Davenport. Now, I really like Davenoprt as a character, he is great but the rest of the story left alot to be desired. It basically introduces Bekker as a pathologist-turned-psycho and what he has done in the past Prey books to get Davenport so intent on hunting him down but unfortunately, it just goes on and on and there is nothing in there that I haven't read before. The only redeeming feature of this one is the fact that Bekker is a complete nutcase (Sandford has done very well here) with a penchant for women's clothing, but apart from that, it is really not an interesting story at all. Infact, I gave 1 extra star for the psycho who likes collecting eyelids and eyes from his victims (good variation on the usual run-of-the-mill serial killer).<br />I am sorely disappointed with the Prey Series and I am really considering not reading any others. If you are after a heart-grabbing sensational crime thrillers try Dennis Lehane or read Mind Prey, if you want to stick with Sandford, otherwise, don't bother with this one.	2000-09-23

I know, I know that it gets better further on but it was so damn boring &amp; it was such a tedious job getting to where I already was that I couldn't keep it up.<br />Why? I really don't know. Pearson's dialogue between characters is really not that good at all &amp; maybe his plots are better, but the story wasn't really going anywhere and it didn't get my attention right from the beginning, therefore it was doomed!<br />The last reviewer said that after 200 pages the story gets better but nothing that hasn't been done before so I though, why bother? esp when I have a stack of Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane to keep me going for the next few weeks.<br />Maybe I should have stuck with the rest of the book, but the writing and character development is terrible. Crime fiction lovers, do yourself a major favour and read Michael Connolley instead.	2000-09-21
US	50686391	R2FWBG6H1YDG5	0446602620	435728437	Blood Work	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Connelly delivers the goods - again!	What a talented writer Michael Conolley is! I never tire of reading  anything that he has written as he can go from his serial detective Harry  Bosch in works such as Angels Flight and The Concrete Blonde, to other work  involving completely different characters, like in Blood Work.<br />This  thriller centralises around ex-FBI agent, Terry McCaleb, who is  investigating the death of a young lady. McCaleb had received her heart in  a heart-transplant operation &amp; as he is relaxing from his FBI job, her  sister tracks McCaleb down, in order for him to investigate into the death,  which McCaleb does reluctantly, as it seems to be a case of a random  shooting in a deli. But, of course, there is more to the story than meets  the eye and soon McCaleb is off running around searching for the killer and  the motive.<br />Although this is not one of Connelly's best, it is certainly  an excellent read. He is a master of bringing new ideas into crime  thrillers and is able to link other books into his work, without the reader  having to have previously read them.<br />This is a brilliant offering by  Michael Connelly. I highly recommend it if you like crime/thrillers with  not too many characters, easy to follow, excellent writing style and not  too much time waste on the scenery! I am off to read Trunk Music now!	2000-09-18

I have read 4 out of the series so far  &amp; they are all as sensational as each other. Her main character,  Stephanie Plum, is an ex-lingerie buyer and had taken up bounty-hunting as  a career to pay the bills, not that she knows anything any bounty-hunting,  she only likes the title!<br />Stephanie, Lula, Joe Morelli, Grandma Mazur are  all excellent &amp; hilarious characters that will have you laughing along  to everything they do &amp; say. <br />In this series, Stephanie finds herself  running after Mo, an old guy that had failed to appear in court.  Unfortunately for her, he is the town sweetheart, as he never does anything  wrong &amp; he has owned the icecream parlour for as long as everyone  remembers, so chasing after him is not exactly an easy job as there are  many people who love him dearly &amp; don't want to see him  caught.<br />Unfortunately for Stephanie, there are also others after Mo &amp;  so the plot thickens while the bodycount is getting higher and Stephanie  turns to Morelli, Ranger, dying her hair &amp; eating everything she can,  so it will make her job easier ;-)<br />This is truly a sensational, hilarious  book that isn't a brilliant crime thriller but it is the characterisation  of Stephanie and her friends &amp; family that will keep you up all night  and then buying the rest.<br />Highly recommended for anyone that loves a  great comedy with a bit of murder &amp; mystery thrown in for good measure.	2000-09-15

I like my thrillers to be exactly that - a thriller ie-  fast-paced, witty dialogue, heart beating as you turn the page to find out  who the kiler was and what deep, sordid secrets he/she/they had. But what  was this? A very, very, very long-winded story about a boy who finds a  skeletal hand that had been buried over 50 yrs ago &amp; the 2 detectives  that go off in search of the killer. <br />Leaning abit towards Kathy Reichs  &amp; her novels on forensic anthropology, Robinson takes us on a journey  that is filled with so much unnecessary detail - the countryside, the  colour of the wallpaper, the very unexciting &amp; unnecessary  relationships with Banks, his ex-wife, this son and the other detective  that he is having an affair with. Usually, I don't mind about character's  lives are revealed as it is crucial to the storyline or at least gives you  some insight into the characters, but these details went on and on and I  continually skipped paragraphs and pages, just to see who the killer was,  which, I had figured out halfway through the book.<br />The problem I have  with English authors is that they spend far too long setting up scenes and  boring the reader with pages and pages of things that aren't necessary -  this has not changed my opinion.<br />If you are after a great crime novel, or  even a thriller, DON'T get this book, but if you are after a story about  people, thier lives, the colour of their hair, the car they drive and they  countryside they live in, with a subplot of a murder that happened in a  small town, then you will love it!	2000-09-14

This is my first Robert Crais book, after I had seen all of his work rate  so highly on Amazon.com, and I had to say that it is brilliant!<br />Crais  introduces us to ex-cop, now PI, Elvis Cole - who is very much into martial  arts (with baddies) and witty one-liners with potential clients. Along with  his psycho friend, they out to the streets and fight crime (along probably  making &amp; breaking their own rules as they go along).<br />Stalking the  Angel brings us into the world of the Japanese Mafia and kidnapping.  Although this can be a heavy subject, it is dealt with in an extremely  amusing &amp; entertaining storyline and you will be laughing along with  Cole's antics and razorsharp dialogue.<br />If you are looking for a good  crime/thriller novel with alot of humour and entertainment, then don't pass  up Stalking the Angel!	2000-09-08

I loved Mind Prey and was hoping that the rest of  the Prey series were written in the same way, but Secret Prey was  not.<br />This crime thriller sees the reader again with Lucas Davenport  trying to solve a murder of an extremely wealthy businessman - there are a  number of possible suspects and one by one they get eliminated during the  course of the book. Halfway through the book the reader finds out who the  killer is, but it still takes Lucas a while to get there. <br />I enjoyed this  book, but it certainly didn't 'wow' me like Mind Prey as I felt that the  last half of the book really didn't tell us anything new, it just made us  follow Lucas' trail to the killer. I read this book in a few hours &amp; I  recommend it if you are looking for time to kill.<br />I don't think that this  is one of Sandford's best, but it is still entertaining.	2000-09-07

It has been a year or so since I read  Mortal Fear &amp; I couldn't remember who wrote it until I picked up The  Quiet Game. <br />The Quiet Game is a legal thriller that grabs you right from  the beginning and doesn't let go. Penn Cage is a best-selling author that  goes back home to Natchez after his wife dies. He thought that while he was  there, he could catch up on some R&amp;R, but he was sorely  mistaken.<br />Penn is soon involved in solving a murder that occurred 30  years ago, looking out for his dad who is being blackmailed and reassessing  his relationship with a girl from his hometown...and how all of this fits  together. <br />Iles keeps enough suspense in the story to make it extremely  interesting &amp; believable. There are enough twists &amp; turns to keep  you turning the pages and strangley, even though, there are many  characters, it all seems to flow together nicely and you are not left  wondering &quot;who was that again?&quot;.<br />If a book doesn't grab me  right from the beginning, it is doomed! But, this certainly hooked me in  from the first page &amp; didn't let me go until 2 days later, much to the  annoyance of my fiance! <br />If you are looking for a great crime/legal  thriller, then pick this up asap, you will not be disappointed!	2000-09-07

Angels Flight is not as good as Void Moon, but it is still a great crime novel. Connelly is your better-than-average crime/suspense novelist and he  doesn't disappoint with Angels Flight. <br />Harry Bosch is great &amp; the  story basically is about the murder of 2 people, one being a high-profile  lawyer. It is better than just your average 'whodunit' as it is still  political enough to be interesting and still clever enough to keep you  guessing throughout the book, with enough twists to make it  believable.<br />After a few crappy crime/suspense novels that I have read in  the last couple of days, Connelly was just the ticket to get me back into  great ones again &amp; I have just ordered all his books!	2000-09-03

I was after a light read after a few heavy crime novels and  JD Robb's novel hit the spot. Unfortunately, now I remember why I got into  great crime novels..to get away from the romantic suspense novels, that are  basically Mills &amp;Boon with a bit of crime thrown in to fill up the  pages. <br />I was able to read Naked In Death in a few hours, the plot is ok,  nothing exciting but really, a billionaire that is still avaliable goes  after a interesting looking cop, she has an affair with him &amp; her  superior doesn't really mind..ok.<br />A bit of realism wouldn't go astray,  but then again, this is really just a bit of fluff to fill my Saturday  lunchtime at work.<br />I don't think that I will be getting another JD Robb  book again unless I was completely bored and the library burnt down.	2000-09-03

Although this book has over 130 chapters (it is only about 250 pages), it  makes it very easy to read and you look forward to the rest of the story  instead of flicking through the pages to see when the chapter ends. I  really enjoyed Farrell from KEY news as she embarks on a story involving  the famous Faberge eggs that were commissioned by the Russian Czar, many  years ago. Although, this is not really a 'great' crime novel (like John  Sandford or Dennis Lehane) it has enough likeable (or not!) characters to  keep you entertained throughout the whole story, similar to Janet  Evanovich, without the humour.<br />If you are looking for a great, easy to  read novel, that truly isn't boring or a chore, try this one, it is really  worth it!	2000-09-03

Jack Wade an arson adjuster for California Fire and Life Mutual, he  understands and reads fires like no other person I have ever come across.  The first half of the book is exactly an EXTREMELY detailed version of how  Jack reads fire and how he became an arson adjustor...unfortunately for me,  I really can't endure page after page of detailed descriptions for fires  and gas chromatography - and I am a scientist!<br />Finally, after skipping  several pages of descriptions about burn marks, patters on the wall and  carpet, I finally see a story emerging, but by the time this happens, it is  filled with ridiculous characters and plots that I can barely keep my eyes  open..at four o'clock in the afternoon!<br />I had to put this book down about  1/2 way through, I really didn't care anymore about 'whodunit' or  'why'...<br />If you have insommnia or you really love fires, then buy this  book but otherwise stick to Dennis Lehane, John Sandford or James Patterson  for interesting crime/thrillers.	2000-08-28

I was expecting a brilliant crime fiction novel, the way that everyone  carries on about Ed McBain, but infact, I think that I could have written a  better book. <br />The story revolves around an old man that was found dead in  his bed, by his daughter. But did he really die in his sleep? Or was there  foul play? Who cares? <br />I read the entire book, but guessed the ending  almost straight away. I can't believe that someone who has written 80 books  has produced this drivel. As far as comparing him to John Sandford - well,  I don't think how that comparison can be made - chalk &amp; cheese!<br />If  you a looking for a great crime fiction, miss this out and do get John  Sandford or Michael Conolloy.	2000-08-27

Then I got &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot;..it is a  very quick, excellent read that has more twists and turns than you can  imagine plus they ALL MAKE SENSE!!!

I would definately have to agree with one of the reviews already written.  The opening of this thriller is superb, but after that the plot jumps  around too much and there are too many characters introduced. I really  couldn't get into this 'thriller' at all. By 1/4 into the book, I really  didn't care who the Travelling Man was or what else he had done.<br />If you  are after brilliant thrillers, try Dennis Lehane or James Patterson ( I  read 2 of their books in one sitting) while still trying to read Every Dead  Thing, hoping it would get better..it didn't.	2000-08-24

I have read 3 of Lehane's novels and they are all  brillant. I have to agree with other people's comments..the conbination of  Kenzie/Gennaro is wonderful. Lehane really brings to characters to life and  you really feel like you are in the story with them. I don't think I have  read anything by an author that can actually bring me into the action, like  he does. The book is filled with great one-liners and has a great storyline  to boot!<br />I didn't think that this book (or any of the rest) are too  violent, but if you are a fan of crime fiction, then what do you expect?  <br />A truly sensational book, I highly recommend it if you are looking for a  freal page-turner, filled with suspense, comedy and old-fashioned  who-done-it?<br />The only problem with Lehane, he doesn't publish books quick  enough!	2000-08-21

I think that Sandford has  written better Prey novels and this one really lacks an edge. It has the  typical beginnings of a good crime novel, but soon falls away with a boring  story and a disappointing ending.<br />Try Mind Prey if you are after a great  book by Sandford, this one is not really worth getting unless it is from  the library.	2000-08-21

It was witty and there was definately  a great storyline to follow - it was exactly what i was looking for after a  few heavy crime novels. But 3/4 of the way, it started to introduce too  many characters who were involved in the plot and I really couldn't be  bothered with it anymore. I really didn't care why Clara had run away or  where she had gone. <br />I have read much better crime novels and I don't  think that I will be reading another by Stephen Greenleaf..I think I'd  rather stick to Dennis Lehane.	2000-08-21

I haven't read a horror for a  while now &amp; this was a perfect one to get me started again. Ok, so John  Saul can't do horror like Stephen King but I disagree with many of the  reviews about this book. I liked the fact it was in a small town with a  secret and the newcomers have to find out what it is etc. The story made  perfect sense to me &amp; it wasn't at all difficult following where it was  all leading up to.<br />I have never read a John Saul book, but I quite liked  this one, it kept me riveted right until the end...I will be going out and  getting another one..<br />For all of you who have never heard of John Saul or  read anything of his (like me), pick this one up, it is a good read!	2000-08-14

I have never read any of his work before and I loved it!<br />Connelly gets the reader straight into the  action with the opening of Cassie and Max working together, as thieves who  rip off casino gamblers, that win big time. Fast forward to 6 yrs later,  where Cassie is in need of scoring some big dollars and she needs to work  again, unfortunately for her, she rips off the wrong guy and so the story  continues. You actually want her to get out unscathed - even though she is  the 'bad guy' in this book. Usually, the author makes you rooting for the  police, ME, detective, PI etc etc, but this is the opposite!<br />I read this  in 1 day as I couldn't put it down. It was a sensational thriller and is  highly recommended if you are tired of the usual crime genre.	2000-08-14

It is extremely  graphical and sometimes the English police terminology was hard to  understand, but I definately recommend this book if you can stomach the  details and if you don't mind the medical terminology. <br />The story is  sensational even though halfway through you know who the killer is, it  doesn't stop there. It is diffcult to reveal the killer half way into the  book and still keep the reader interested, but Hayder did it well.<br />Not as  good as Lehane, Pottinger or Deaver but I will definately be getting  Hayder's next novel.	2000-08-11

I would have  to agree with some of the reviews all ready written that it was a bit  far-fetched esp with the paper &amp; writing analysis, but I suppose  without that there wouldn't have been a story.<br />Still, this is better than  your average crime/thriller novels that are around at the moment &amp;  because I am always on the lookout for 'something different' but of the  same genre, this was quite good. Highly receommended if you are fan of John  Sandford or Dennis Lehane - although not quite as good as those two.	2000-08-11

I have never encountered a writer like Lehane. He really brings his  characters to life and the he is a great suspense/thriller/crime writer.

The story has far too many  unexplained events &amp; Lisa doesn't bother to explain major storylines -  like Melanie's memory loss etc . <br />If you are after a good crime novel  that will leave you reeling afterwards, try something from Dennis Lehane or  Stanley Pottinger.

This has got to be one of the best novels I have read..the  only negative aspect - it is a bit long &amp; because all the characters  are interwoven within in each other, it gets a bit confusing but definately  keep reading...it is well worth the ending! <br />I can't wait to read another  Stanley Pottinger book, these are the sort of books I love - not just a  boring whodunit, or why they did it or even a boring romance..it has  everything a good book should &amp; heaps more!

This is a very long book but it gets you in the  story straight away and you can't put it down. <br />The Don, Sonny, Michael  Corleone &amp; the rest of the Family make compelling reading - this book  has something for everyone who enjoys crime fiction and you know that this  what NY would have been like in the 30's-60's. I am sure that the character  Johnny Fontane was based on Frank Sinatra.<br />Although I am Italian, I never  really got interested in the Mafia, until The Sopranos.

I found the protagonist too annoying &amp; found it hard to believe that someone in her 30's couldn't work things out herself in the  relationships she had with men. <br />I do realise that it is supposed to be a  toungue-in-cheek look at women &amp; their complexes but I couldn't really  identify with the protagonist.<br />The book is easy to read but not very  exciting or funny. It is ok if you have nothing else to read and want  something very light.	2000-07-04

I found this better than Four to Score as there was more to the plot not just what Stephanie wore or ate. The characters are wonderful esp Grandma Mazur. If  you want time out from serious crime fiction, but still enjoy reading it  &amp; you want some humour, then these books are for you. I have already  ordered Hot Six &amp; I can't to get it!	2000-06-16
US	50686391	R2RTNHTZEI5TLQ	0330348485	793919160	Goodnight, My Angel	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Some light reading	This is an entertaining crime/thriller. It only took me a couple of hours to get through but it was a disappointing novel as I guessed the killer halfway through the book plus the heroine is a little to heroic in the  things that she does. If you want a light, Sunday afternoon book, then this  is the one to get.	2000-05-23

But, this book was unbelievably boring! There isn't anything to keep you turning the pages. I stopped about 'July'  as I couldn't take it anymore. If you want to read about what life was like  in the Year 1000,pick another book.	2000-05-18

I thought this book sounded great but I just couldn't get passed the first few chapters, it was so slow and boring. I really appreciate good  horror stories (I love Stephen King &amp; Anne Rice) but this had nothing  to keep me interested at all. I am very glad that I did waste my time  reading the rest of this book, obviously it doesn't get any better.	2000-05-18
US	50686391	R1Z8USWR4XZUM0	156100765X	810981621	The Daddy Clock	Books	3	0	3	N	N	Easy reading	This is an enjoyable book that is easy to read and relatively funny along the way, but the ending could have been dealt with better. This is a fun and light book to read if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday, but I  certainly won't be running to the bookstore when this author publishes  another book.	2000-05-09
US	50686391	REEZUSB0DMZ0Z	014025661X	593064816	An Evening with the Messiah	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Easy to read	This is an easy to read book, that is quite enjoyable. I was disappointed by the ending &amp; the characters in the book weren't developed enough, but it is an ok book to read if you have nothing to do on a lazy Sunday.	2000-05-09
US	50686391	R21JIL58WQ5O0H	0312954212	833302189	Tully	Books	5	1	4	N	N	Brilliant!	This book is absolutely brilliant, it affected me for days after I had finished reading it. This is probably one of the best books that I have ever read and I am a die-hard Stephen King, Patricia Cornwell, Janet  Evanovich fan. I recommend this book to anyone, esp if you only read one  book at year, definately read Tully. <br />I am an avid reader, but don't get  much time read anymore, I find myself reading only the first few chapters  of books and then dumping it, if it doesn't capture my attention ( I would  never usually do this! ) But with Tully, it drew me in straight away, I  couldn't put it down and was reading it even at work as I loved this book  so much. I will probably be re-reading it shortly &amp; I  never re-read  books!<br />Definately read this book!  Have I said it enough?	2000-04-25
