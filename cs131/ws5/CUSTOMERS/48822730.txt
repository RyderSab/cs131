What I remember of S.F. is lots of stories centered around men in space, with lots of ridiculous, unpronounceable names for things and goofy deus-ex-machina \\"technologies.\\" Most of these stories have neither of those elements. They are considered, accessible contemporary fiction, some of the best being written in any \\"genre\\" in the world today.<br /><br />The excerpt from Matt Ruff's HOUSE OF SOULS excited me tremendously, and I'm now reading that book.	2005-08-08

Wordless stories drawn in all different styles, always beautiful. The comparison to Krazy Kat is certainly apropos. These stories usually involve just a few key characters playing off each other in each story in different and fascinating ways every time. Manhog, the loser; Jerry Chicken, the mercant; Pupshaw, the \\"godling\\" (Frank's pet -- \\"god\\" is obviously related to \\"dog\\" in this case); and Frank, \\"our hero\\" who isn't always moral. In the black and white stories, the backgrounds are drawn in a woodcut style, and the color stories are painted with a beauty that can be compared to (I wish I knew more about this stuff) Dali and such. FRANK is completely different from anything you'll ever read, and it's quite possible (as another reviewer says) that it is the only comic from Fantagraphics, Drawn & Quarterly, or anybody to show any real vision. Certainly it's the only one today to use original characters, doing interesting, cartoony doings and still be amazing art. Chris Ware is brilliant but seems capable only of one set of emotions; besides \\"Ghost World,\\" Daniel Clowes really isn't that great; and I hate R. Crumb except for his very early greeting-card and sketchbook stuff, which amounts to just well-made funny comics (which were all over the place in the fourties, and aren't really that special except that no one is really doing them anymore).<br />Anyway, these books are wonderful. I give them four stars because I like better the current ongoing FRANK comic magazines from Fantagraphics (five so far, 12 or so pages each). They further simplify the characters and environment to the essence. And they have more PUPSHAW! I can't tell you how much I love Pupshaw and Pushpaw. I would buy an 800-page book if Pupshaw and Pushpaw were on every page.<br />Anyway, get these books because no one else today is doing work this brilliant.	2001-12-20

His best work is to be found elsewhere (check out his brand-new full-length hardcover book from DC for a trip), but this book is certainly good.

Chris Ware is brilliant in every way. Design! Story! Dialogue! Pacing! Layout! Composition! This huge 32-page book (intended to evoke the huge comics sections of yore), printed luxuriantly on yellow-tinted thick paper, includes the serialized exploits of Rusty Brown (collector), Tales From The Future (consumer), and Quimby the Mouse (who has one strip for each season of the year).<br />Like in Acme #7, the centerfold is a huge Jimmy story (this time it's about Christmas). But there is another centerfold (printed on thick white paper) inside of THAT centerfold, which has a stereoscopic motion picture viewer cutout on one side and a Rusty Brown calendar on the other side. The movie viewer is nearly impossible to put together, but the calendar would make a great wall hanging. As always, the themes are always loss and grief -- but executed through the most brilliant whole-package design comics has seen since Krazy Kat or Flash Gordon. Every element is controlled and used to Ware's advantage.<br />Appearing in cameo is God/Superman (cover, where he appears as the antithesis of Jimmy), Rocket Sam (2 strips), and Big Tex (one strip). There's also a serious article by Ware, an obituary for his art teacher who died (it's even relevant to the book because he collected like Rusty Brown) which is especially touching because it's not funny or ironic. The cover itself unfolds to become a huge diagram to which I still haven't figured out all the meanings. And the cover is colored by HAND. It's beautiful.<br />One thing to watch out for is that the front cover has some spots in the white areas -- this was true for every copy at my local comics shop. I think they're all like that. So don't yell at Amazon if your copy is speckled. It's not a big deal, only in one area of the cover.<br />Notice Ware's cameos: he appears buying the edison rolls from Chalky White, his early book &quot;Floyd Farland&quot; is at Captain Kid's Treasure Trove, and his 6' display is in the small &quot;Putty Gray&quot; comic strip below the movie viewer cutouts.<br />His next book will be the first chapter in a full-length Rusty Brown novel. In a few years we should see a Chris Ware sketchbook from Germany (Fanta will import it). If you like this one, be sure to seek out Ware's other issues of the Acme Novelty Library at your local quality comics shop or Fantagraphics's web site.<br />Hint on storing this book: I keep my Acme 15 and 7 sandwiched in between my computer tower and the wall, and it works very well.<br />-Yakov.Gray&quot; comic strip below the movie viewer cutouts.<br />His next book will be the first chapter in a full-length Rusty Brown novel.

Frank Miller is very good at making The Last Comic Book (after which comics can finally move on to a post-Kirby era); he keeps doing it over and over again. First the Daredevil run, then The Dark Knight Returns, then Sin City, then 300, and now this: an intentionally ridiculous sci-fi techno-thriller (in the mainstream cinema, &quot;Terminator,&quot; &quot;The Matrix,&quot; sense) starring a man who thinks he has a perfectly normal life, but then it turns out he's only programmed to think that, etc., right up to the nonsensical revelation (you'll plotz when you find out why he was created), predictable climax (I guessed it correctly after one glance at the cover!), and signature Miller letdown ending (Batman doesn't die, Marv gets into Roark's fortress pretty goddamn easily after all that, and...?). I would love it for its sheer audacity (pushing the tired &quot;post-apocalyptic sex-based society&quot; idea to its limits, killing extras by the truckload without so much as a fare-thee-well, writing ridiculous movie-star [&quot;Come and get it, you bum...&quot;]/funnybook [&quot;oof!&quot;/&quot;ag!&quot;/&quot;oof!&quot;/&quot;oof!&quot;/&quot;nef!&quot;/&quot;hah!&quot;/&quot;oof!&quot;/&quot;hah!&quot;/&quot;oof!&quot;/yaa&quot; is from an actual sequence] dialog, giving all the women, including the female robots, gorgeous bodies), If Miller hadn't created so MANY comics exactly this one. (Waiting now for &quot;DK2.&quot;)<br />Geoff Darrow, however, really gets a chance to show off his technical abilities in this story. In fact, this entire book can be considered an excercise for Darrow. His anatomy and perspective is wonderful (at least when you compare it to most mainstream &quot;artists&quot;) and he can draw post-apocalyptic crowd scenes and bloody robots (with skin hanging off, torn clothes, eyeballs hanging out of metallic sockets) like, um, no one else. The colors are OK, although I find myself wishing Darrow had done them (they were assemblylined by a fellow named John Workman). They feel a little subdued, slowing down the pace.<br />Overall, this is a nice 20-minute read to flip through at the library or bookstore.

First issue is the cover. It was supposed to be by Daniel Clowes (who is actually a talented artist) but was rejected because it was too deconstructive of DC's heroes. (You can find the black &amp; white version on the web, just run a search.) And on into the book, which has an embarrasingly contrived &quot;wrap-around&quot; story that is filled with obscure DCU references and was done by half-a-dozen different &quot;creators&quot; -- essentially, it's mainstream. Some of the stories are good, but they could have been a lot better if the authors (talented cartoonists themselves) could have illustrated their own stories. Essentially, no one working on DC's major characters can write and draw his own story unless he has incorporated himself, because of character ownership and other legal issues. Another nail in this collection's coffin right there. All but one of the stories is in color (another nail) and much of it was colored by in-house DC colorists (another nail).<br />HOWEVER, there are two or three stories in here that are definitely worth reading. Better make that two. I'm talking about HAWKMAN by James Kochalka/Dylan Horrocks (art, letters, color by D.H.) that is wonderful with a wonderfulness I can't begin to explain -- just READ it, it's so heart-warming and funny and beautiful and i don't know what else. And then there's BATMAN by some writer and TONY MILLIONARE who draws the &quot;classic batman style&quot; in glorious *black and white* (actually black and sickly green) and it's wonderful.<br />There are some other nice stories in here, but those two are the only ones that really hang together and work well (and have ONE artist).<br />Anyway, this book will probably blow away people who've never read a good alternative comic, but for me it's not so impressive. Do read those two stories I mentioned, though.<br />peace out -- yakov.	2001-10-16

Sharmat has created a hero for young boys. He acts very independently, walking around the neighborhood by himself, making his own pancakes, etc. but he wears his rubbers, and he *always* leaves a note for his mother. Marc Simont really comes through in his laid-back illustrations (some shaded, some in color) that reveal important points of the case, but do not force things down the readers' throats. Also, like the writer, Simont manages humor without going overboard.<br />As in the best children's books, the writing style is simple yet powerful, like a haiku. Although the &quot;Nate the Great&quot; series is written in full sentences, Sharmat has slyly created a wonderful introduction to poetry-that-doesn't-rhyme with his carefully placed line breaks and page breaks. Here is the first page of text: &quot;My name is Nate the Great. / I am a detective. / I work alone. / Let me tell you about my last case: / I had just eaten breakfast. / It was a good breakfast.&quot;<br />The first book in the Nate the Great series is by far the best, because the funniest parts are in the character development that, of course, takes a back seat in later volumes. The establishing shots of and paragraphs talking about Nate, Annie, Fang, and Rosamond are absolutely hilarious. Continuity watchdogs will note Fang's slightly more menacing nature (and color change) and Annie's lost fascination for yellow in later books. Of course, kids won't notice or care.<br />The official reviews don't make it clear which books in the series are actually in this volume. The cover is definitely not the original cover of book 1. You might want to look into that before buying.<br />This series is great fun for little kids and whoever is lucky enough to be reading to them. Get all the Nate you can find!	2000-11-12

Others have expounded on the great art, writing, etc. But I think the humongous format, lushly detailed images, and reversal of Superman's standard modus operandi has the effect of showing us that there really isn't a big future out there for superhero comics. In this book, DC is proving to itself once again that it's upteen titles per month per character, endless continuity acrobatics, $3.25 per book, assembly-line system just isn't going to work in the long term.<br />But back to talking about this book... The format is nice, but the interior pages my copy (actually my copy of Batman: War on Crime, which is in the same format) have gotten kind of wrinkly near the spine. I've talked to a lot of people, and it seems like there's no way to prevent that from happening with the heavy glossy stock. Oh well. It's really breathtaking art though. // ----Koby	2000-11-08

Some of these plot points were told or alluded to in episodes of THE NEW BATMAN ADVENTURES or BATMAN BEYOND but they didn't go in depth as much as this book does.<br />THE LOST YEARS tells how Batgirl became an official part of Batman's team; Dick Grayson dropped his Robin persona, left Batman, and became Nightwing; and how Tim Drake became Robin. In the &quot;real&quot; comic book continuity, these events were sloppily spread out over dozens of years and creators, with filler all over the place. Here, Hilary Bader and the animated team tell the story in a much more satisfying, concise, and kid-friendly fashion, in 128 pages.<br />Forget your preconceptions of Hilary Bader -- here, she is gold. Hampton and Beatty are at the top of their form, and, of course, Ty Templeton's covers are always welcome.<br />My only problem is with the physical book: the paper is cheap and the cover's pretty wobbly.

The animated cartoons I mentioned above are now on CARTOON NETWORK, except for BATMAN BEYOND, which is still on Kids' WB! Saturday mornings and in production as of this writing.	2000-11-07

Since hischaracter is pretty awfully constructed, Batman has to dumb himselfdown to fit into his comic book. The colors are garish, the dialogueis awful, and the layouts stink.  As others have said, the pinups(i.e. every panel) are cute. The inside back cover is a dedication toJack Kirby, which, when you think about it, is absolutelyhilarious. Frank Miller is an enigma; it seems that he has a severecase of multiple personality disorder... hopefully, his forthcomingsequel to &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; will be written on agood day.	2000-11-01

First, the plot: There are holes in the holes! If Hell is so powerful, why haven't they won in 500 years' time? Seems like they could just destroy the world in a year's time; humans could do it much faster, after all. The new Spawn, Daniel Llanso, is worse than Al Simmons in his self-absorbed time-wasting vacillations between easy evil and difficult virtue. The akward, wordy dialogue and captions make me cringe. (&quot;Battered, broken, a weeping wound from head to toe, Daniel Llanso uses the last of his waning strength to leap and dig his talons into the runneled, festering archdaemon flesh of the sovereign of the bottomless pit, the destroyer, the chief of the demon locusts. Abaddon.&quot; Rereading this gives me a stomachache.) One caption box in particular: &quot;--AND A NEW HELLSPAWN RISES.&quot; is nearly illegible from the multiple computer effects and filters applied to the text and background. And this brings me to the art.<br />It is undeniably cartoony, but somehow over-detailed besides. It's anyone's guess how Dwayne Turner pulls this off. All lines are inked with exactly the same thickness, so you have to stare at the picture for a few minutes to figure out what the heck you're looking at. And it would be an understatement to say the computer coloring is overdone. It's beyond the realm of overdone. Just plain awful. I can't look at it or think about it anymore. BLECCHH. If zero stars was allowed I would have picked it. Avoid this and other Spawn books at any cost. ..............-koby.	2000-10-29

LITTLE LIT, the brainchild of comics master Art Spiegelman, was created to fill a void in comics: There is nothing out there anymore for kids. He looked around himself and saw talent brimming over the surface, but no one creating for the people who made comics popular in the first place. On the back, it says, &quot;COMICS -- They're not just for grown-ups anymore!&quot; The oversize hardcover is a collection of seventeen artists -- some comics creators, some illustrators, some children's book authors -- for this book of fairy tales. Let me say straight out that the art is downright beautiful. Gorgeous. Breathtaking. However, with the exception of one Japanese folk tale, there is absolutely no diversity: All white, and mostly male. There is no excuse for that. Beyond that, however, most of this book is solid gold.<br />Firstly, it's designed by Chip &quot;BATMAN: ANIMATED&quot; Kidd. He is, quite simply, the best graphic designer in the business. In this volume, he strikes the perfect balance between old-fashioned and avant-garde design. And the covers (no dust jacket -- just the leather hardcover) are by Art Spiegelman. The paper is thick and matte. The only problem here is that the book seems a little fragile, like the pages will come out at the slightest provocation. But I could be wrong about that.<br />&quot;Prince Rooster&quot; (Spiegelman), &quot;The Leafless Tree&quot; (Joost Swarte), &quot;The Two Hunchbacks&quot; (Lorenzo Mattotti), &quot;The Baker's Daughter&quot; (Harry Bliss), and &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot; are all lushly drawn, fairly simple fairy tales. &quot;Humpty Trouble&quot; (William Joyce) and &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (David Macaulay) are light satires. &quot;The Hungry Horse&quot; (Kaz) is a wonderful story, my favorite *story* of the batch, but &quot;The Fisherman and the Sea Princess&quot; (David Mazzuchelli), the Japanese folk tale is my favorite overall. The only story here that I don't like is &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; (the ending that nobody knows) by Daniel Clowes, because he can't draw people who look good or smile or anything that you need in a fairy tale. Also thrown in is a lost Walt Kelly cartoon, &quot;The Gingerbread Man,&quot; originally from FAIRY TALE PARADE (?!) in the 40's. Shorter features are a memory game, a laugh-out-loud &quot;What's Wrong With This Picture,&quot; find the twins, and Spookyland (Charles Burns), which is absolutely terrifying -- I think it's too scary for little kids myself. In the front and back is FAIRY TALE ROAD RAGE (Chris Ware), a game with little cars to assemble and chits to punch out and instructions to read. Essentially, you move around the board and create a story by picking random chits and putting them in the appropriate places on your card. When it fills up, you read the story and make up a moral. It's a lot of fun. And the pictures and instructions are absolutely hilarious.<br />All in all, this book is highly recommended for small children of any age! :)<br />E-mail if you would like to discuss (kobyc@softhome.net) ...... -Koby.uot; (the ending that nobody knows) by Daniel Clowes, because he can't draw people who look good or smile or anything that you need in a fairy tale.

The very very beginning shows promise -- if the art is cleaned up a little and the coloring made less garish, then this could have become interesting. Needless to say it didn't. It breaks my heart to see people talking such great thing about Spawn like it's great literature. Go read A CONTRACT WITH GOD, WATCHMEN, BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, MAUS, DAVID BORING, JIMMY CORRIGAN THE SMARTEST KID ON EARTH, and most importantly UNDERSTANDING COMICS. Then get your money away from Todd McFarlane's new clothes and read some real comics literature.	2000-10-28
US	48822730	R3HGKR66L0980I	0375406921	392405614	David Boring	Books	3	3	10	N	N	SPOILERS: Well written, but supremely depressing	The story of &quot;David Boring&quot; is really great. It takes its characters through a roller-coaster ride of surprising plot twists, with all kinds of wonderful literary junk in there. But -- even though lots of stuff happens to the characters, I don't feel like they really grow or change by the time the book ends. All of David's quests come for naught. The ending doesn't feel like the ending of a novel; it feels more like the ending of a short story.<br />And maybe this book wouldn't depress me so much if Dan Clowes had the ability or desire to draw anyone honestly smiling or -- heavens! -- laughing. Based on this book and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; in LITTLE LIT, it becomes clear to me that Clowes himself is a very depressed person. This comes through in his art....<br />But, overall, DAVID BORING is a well-constructed graphic novel that gives a glimpse into the full-scale renaissance of comics literature that could be just around the corner. (As it says on the second page of JIMMY CORRIGAN, &quot;It is expected that the earliest examples of such literature will appear in target economic regions later in the year, with a general release in the fall.&quot;)...	2000-10-27

The paper is nice, the three articles in the beginning (one by Eisner, one by Alan Moore, one by someone else whose name I don't remember) are nice. But there's a problem: Since the strips are seven pages long, every other story starts on the left page. But they originally were on the right! Eisner had a great eye for layouts, and this includes facing pages. This effect is killed in every other story. I hope this oversight is corrected future editions, especially the later, more visually impressive strips.	2000-10-27
