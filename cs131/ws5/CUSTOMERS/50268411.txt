Imagine being in a world where every girl's main concern is getting married to a handsome, rich man.  That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice.  Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off.  Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.)  One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that.  Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet.  Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman.  The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet.  I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you.  Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book.  You can see her ingorance in her first statements which she bases on the fact,&quot;That a single man in possien of good fortune must be in need of a wife.&quot;  All in all, I really find the book and the statement above shallow.  All though I understand that British society at that time diplayed courting as the top of the list for females, but this book makes women appear as empty-headed, man-hungry, child-like people that bow down to man's and society's every wish.  I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband. I also find this book unrealistic for many reasons, mostly because the complete personality of the charcters change in the blink of an eye.  I really feel that this book is not pleasurable to read, though it may benefit you to read it so that you can learn to find the good and bad pionts of a book and compare it to other literature like it or during that time.	2000-10-16

That's how Becca, from Becca's Story felt.<br />     Becca likes her life the way it is, but when the war breaks out, she knows life will never be the same.  Because she hints they should support their country, both of her beaux, Alex and Charlie, join the army.  She feels she is now responsible for what happens to either of them.<br />     Before they part, both Alex and Charlie ask for her hand in marriage.  Becca loves both of them equally, but she must make a decision before, or if, they come back.<br />     I believe this is a very interesting book.  Forman did a great job combining history with a love story.  Although there was a bit too much history, this really is a great book.	2000-10-16

Imagine being stranded in the wilderness alone and learning to survive.  We all think about it at least once in our life, learning to hunt, getting shelter, and staying sane.  In the book, Hatchet, Brian Robeson, age thirteen, is stranded in the Canadian wilderness, after his plane crashes, with only a hatchet and the clothes on his back.  Brian was on that plane to his dad's house because of the Secret...     This survival-fiction book tells how Brian undergoes a complete character change.  When he first arrives he is relatively weak, but eventually Brian has keen, alert, senses, and he is a stronger person.  In the book, Brian must deal with insane moose, and making a new friend; fire.  Hunting and food gathering is a major part of the book, which makes it seem very realistic, but will Brian ever make it home alive?    This book is a Newbery honor book and I believe it is very deserving of that prestigous award.  Gary Paulsen's portrayal of someone in that predicament is very accurate.  He puts you right in the action and in the struggle.  I recommend this book to people of all different ages and backgrounds.  You will feel every moment of hope and rejection in this amazing Paulsen novel.	2000-10-16

Two nations, the United States and the Soviet Union, compete to find a rogue missle submarine. In 1988, Captain Ramius, a Soviet captain in command of the most technologically advanced Russian missle sub, disappears into the Atlantic. The United States President hires Jack Ryan to claim it for the United States, while the Russians try to blow it up. All this counts down to the final conflict.<br />   The book is overall a fairly good book, but some parts are unrealistic strategically; for example, the Russians pile all their military boats into one sea, leaving Russia one big target. The United States does the same thing. This ,however, is the only complaint. Otherwise, the author, Tom Clancy, does a great job translating the nautical terms fot those who haven't heard them.<br />   Overall, the book is very, very good and fun to read. It raises a lot of questions that are fun to think about and makes you wonder how the military works. This book is excellant.	2000-10-16

I don't usually like sports books but this one I did. It's by a well know author, Matt Christopher. It's about two brothers Tlenn and Paul. Glenn, the oldest, teaches Paul to play basketball. There's a problem; Paul has a learning problem and is slow. Paul is on a team but does not play a lot. The coach is mean and treats him badly because of his problem.    Most of the story is exciting, but some parts are  unrealistic. Like there family sits by the fire and sings Christmas songs. Also Glenn and his brother never fight.    Matt Christopher has other good books but this one was my favorite. As you can see Long Shot for Paul is a very good book.	2000-10-16
