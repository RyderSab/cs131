US	52933713	RN2UAGA632JDE	0743262514	611334106	All the President's Spin: George W. Bush, the Media, and the Truth	Books	4	11	14	N	N	A Terrific Resource	This book is a credible, persuasive compendium of misleading communications from the Bush White House.  The authors are credible because they formed spinsanity.com, a website that skewers spinning left and right.  They are a pox on many houses!  When they get to Campaign 2004, for example, they point out howlers and evasions from the Kerry camp as well as the continuing efforts of the White House to stonewall the truth and to disseminate nonsense.  The authors are credible as well because they document their claims so that readers may check their accuracy.  The authors are persuasive because they avoid name-calling and exaggeration in favor of measured criticisms.  They do not call President Bush a liar when he cannot be shown to have deliberately misstated known facts for political gains, for example.  Instead, they note the cunning phrasings and convenient reinterpretations, all of which line up in favor of whatever the President's men and the President seek.   <br /> <br />Most of the time, President Bush and his people do not lie.  Indeed, they do not have to lie.  Most reporters do not look behind what is said, so vague or ambiguous utterances will not be assessed.  Instead, reporters practice a false objectivity.  They balance the overstatements, fallacies, and speciousness of one \\"side\\" against similar shams from opposing \\"sides\\" as if an equilibrium of mendacity were equivalent to the truth. <br /> <br />The book emphasizes that the White House exploits statements that are not provably false but that lead to false conclusions.  This is a crucial insight!  When Bill O'Reilly and other defenders of the Administration indulge in Clintonesque literalism to prove that President Bush never technically lied, they encourage listeners and viewers to conclude that the President is honest.  That is naive.  The key question is whether our president bamboozles.  If he bamboozles us, then the President is not truly honest.  President Bush's predecessor was seldom caught flat-out lying [and paid the price when he was finally caught lying] but \\"Slick Willie\\" dodged and shucked and buffaloed all the livelong day.  President Clinton's other deceptions were far more insidious than his fibs and lies.  So it is with George W. Bush. <br /> <br />The authors do identify instances of deliberate misstatements.  When the president claimed that he had said in Campaign 2000 what he cannot be demonstrated ever to have said at all [pp. 1-2], he may simply have misremembered that Vice President Gore made the statement in question in 1998.  However, when the president's team was informed that the president was speaking a falsehood, the president and his spinners did not eliminate the falsehood immediately.  Rather, they continued to wield the falsehood to alibi their deficits.  That is deliberate reliance on what once may have been misstatement but with repetition became a lie. <br /> <br />This book disturbs because it shows how politicians left and right elect deliberate misrepresentations and flimflammery.  Every American adult should realize that Democrats and Republicans alike have bought into fictions that support themselves and their causes.   <br /> <br />Whatever we citizens reward, we'll likely get more of.  If we reward politicos for misleading us, the best deceivers will tend to survive and truth-tellers will tend to lose.  That Bubba would be followed by Dubya is no accident!  Deception works!  Slander works!  Flimflam has always worked to some degree, but we the citizenry must punish political con artists or live under them forevermore. <br /> <br />I stopped just short of five stars, however, because I believe that the authors slight the efforts of Corn, Conason, Franken, and others to document this administration's flagrant whoppers.  I can see why the authors may have wanted to differentiate their labors from efforts that call the President and his aides liars.  Still, whenever the authors stop short of noting deliberate falsifications, they condone or reward lies.  In short, I suspect that the authors may have [I hope inadvertently] understated the lying of Kerry and Bush.  I fear that spinsanity.com has itself spun!	2004-09-08
US	52933713	R3GIYWNDSOC6BK	0670032735	748219420	The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)leads America	Books	5	14	17	N	N	Challenging, Compelling, Chilling Review & Preview	I agree with much that previous reviewers have put much better than I ever could. This book is NOT an easy read because <br />  <br /> 1) it is encyclopedic, far more compendious than other samplers of deviance and deception in the White House 2001-2003;  <br />  <br /> 2) it is documented thoroughly and carefully; <br />  <br /> 3) most (perhaps nearly all) of its characterizations and interpretations are reasonable and even-handed, which makes the prose more daunting than sound bites on &quot;Air America&quot; or &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot;; and <br />  <br /> 4) it covers in far greater detail and nuance many incidents familiar from other books (by Ivins, Conason, Corn, Franken, John Dean). <br />  <br /> The virtue on which I focus in praising this work, however, is that the authors explain how and why the Bush Administration has pursued mendacity and mush with such success. Their first hypothesis -- that Rove and others have learned that sheer, stubborn cunning and daring will usually overcome facts and fairness because an easily cowed media will not expose the Administration, especially after 9-11 -- shows us that honesty in high office has reached a new nadir. Innocents who thought that President Bush would have little trouble being more honorable and more honest than his predecessors must admit that Slick Willie never dreamed of getting away with such boldfaced, baldfaced hokum as Dubya routinely does. Nixon and Clinton lied, too. They got called on their lying to a far greater degree than Bush 43. <br />  <br /> The indolence and expedience of modern mass media are crucial to Rove's and Dubya's getting away with their cons. Reporters, editors, and publishers know that, for instance, almost all the science cited by the White House is junk science. They do not bother to correct President Bush or his minions because it would take research beyond the Rolodex and because they fear being called &quot;liberal.&quot; Please note that fear of being called &quot;liberal&quot; does not by itself doom the media's efforts; rather, the media's anxieties are exacerbated by their inability and unwillingness to do the hard work of exposing Bush's blather about global warming or stem cells.  <br />  <br /> This book also demonstrates how much of the problem is explained neither by Bush's lying nor by the media's lassitude so much as by the credulity of elites and citizens in thrall to ideology. When liberals accept every libel of President Bush and conservatives reject every suggestion that Dubya may be fudging facts, the polarized polity guarantees that no sensible discussion will ensue. Instead, dogmatists repeat talking points and blockheads on the left and the right chant slogans and shibboleths that reinforce existing cleavages and make civilized discourse and learning improbable. <br />  <br /> In sum, the scary thing about this book is that it is as much a forecast of future decline as it is a chronicle of the downward spiral of the last 12-20 years.	2004-08-04

Walter Olson's tales are usually interesting, especially when he deviates from the facts of cases.  His animosity toward lawyers makes for diatribes that are far more amusing than informative, so Olson's storytelling adds up to theses that seem more compelling the less that one actually knows about law.  As is usual for popularizations, &quot;The Litigation Explosion&quot; will move the unwary to outrage and to tears.  It will not educate the unwary, of course.  It will instead adjust their attitudes so that they will embrace tort reform by book's end.  Olson is a master propagandist, which is usually what the Manhattan Institute wants and pays for.<br />Walter Olson has produced an accessible book regarding lawsuits.  His writing is lively.  You'll laugh; you'll cry; your blood will boil if you mistake his caricatures for reality.  If you believe that lawyer jokes are not merely funny but scholarship, this book is for you.	2004-02-13
US	52933713	RMWMUYLR21Y5Q	0820457922	259778762	Changing Images of Law in Film and Television Crime Stories (Politics, Media, and Popular Culture)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Useful Starting Point	The author categorizes dramatizations, mostly in movies, by the degree to which they resemble liberal imagery, conservative imagery, or images between those stereotypes.  Dr. Lenz labels liberal those films or shows that depict or endorse due process ideals, rehabilitation, indeterminate sentencing, judicial review, legal autonomy, or professional administration of criminal justice.  Movies or television programs that prefer crime control ideals,  punishment, determinate sentences, legislative control, populist sovereignty, or political administration of justice Professor Lenz labels conservative. Those loosely defined \\"poles\\" form a Liberal-Conservative Non-Continuum, which leaves room for other images that the author presumes to be intermediate.<BR>  <BR>The author then associates these archetypes and the intermediate category with historical eras.  Accordingly, he finds that liberal images are associated with films of the 1930s and around 1960.  Conservative images, by contrast, have been more prominent since the 1970s; while the transitional 1960s and early 1970s, accompanied by waning regard for liberal views and waxing support for conservatism, shaped admixtures of liberal and conservative imagery.  Lenz speculates that a new transitional state may be in the offing as criticisms of current criminal justice conservatism mount.  <br />Lenz detects themes in cinematic or televised productions by closely assessing the plotlines that he then interprets consistent with his categorization of images and periodization of productions.  Some of his descriptions of movie plots are quite lengthy, such as his treatment of such classics as \\"12 Angry Men\\" or \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" so this monograph may launch some college or high school papers.  The narratives are generally accurate and reasonably representative of main story lines and include some peripheral but meaningful scenes and characters.  Long or short, his sketches of films and television programs, such as \\"Dragnet\\" and \\"Law & Order,\\" usually yield messages that Lenz then fits to liberal or conservative themes.  <br />Of course, this book's approach has some problems.  First, most dramatizations emphasize one or more themes but feature opposing perspectives implicitly.  Any feature film will likely project images from one pole, from the other pole, and points in between.  Of course some facets of criminal justice need little or no emphasis to be accessible to mass moviegoers, so the presence of this theme or the dearth of that theme need not betoken much in any instance.  The import of any asserted theme, it follows, is problematic.  <br />Lenz is sometimes interpretive and sometimes impressionistic, an approach that generates insights but tempts both the author and his readers to overlook opposing premises, baseline norms, and clashing values that make many movies rich and interesting.  Readers thus will find in this monograph a wealth of ideas but should not use it for confirmation or authority.<br />Third, the author's themes often require that he hammer films until they fit.  For example, Lenz has obvious reasons to assert that the multiple \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies denigrate liberal legalism and liberal politics.  Beyond the obvious, however, each of the motion pictures featuring Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) also reinforces liberal politics and images inconsistent with either of Lenz's ideological \\"poles.\\"  Inspector Callahan's partners in the first three films of the series are Hispanic (in \\"Dirty Harry\\"), African-American (in \\"Magnum Force\\"),  or female (in \\"The Enforcer\\" after Callahan's Italian American male partner is stabbed), and each projects the mettle of a member of a previously under-represented group in law enforcement.  This strikes me as a liberal message that might induce some in the audience to believe that desegregation-even (in \\"the Enforcer\\") affirmative action-might result in an influx of courage and competency into the police ranks that tend, across the series, to be led by craven incompetents.  Harry Callahan attacks newfangled notions and resists \\"progress,\\" but he also learns the error of some of his ways even as he reasserts at great muzzle velocity and caliber the superiority of his cowboy ways.  Moreover, judges and administrators (in the Lenz liberal column) and elected officials and their handlers (who likely align on the conservative pole) frequently appear loathsome when they are not inept, which could easily foster selective confirmation of expectations by a viewer/interpreter.  <br />The selection of motion pictures and television programs should trouble any reader familiar with movies of a given era.  Given the volume of movies that are produced, a number that have some focus on criminal justice must be neglected, of course, in a short book.  Many readers will never have heard of \\"Adam's Rib\\" (1949) and will be unaware of its multiple liberal and conservative themes regarding criminal justice that are embedded in the comedic battle of the sexes between Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.  <br />For the reasons above, this book serves to generate insights and ideas but does not provide comprehensive coverage or much depth.	2004-01-21

Alterman's contention is that conventional beliefs are molded and common sense is formed in large measure through the influence of observers who are more famous than informed.<br />Pundits rule America, the author argues, by constructing and maintaining &quot;informed opinion&quot; that marginalizes alternative perspectives left and right.  Commentators narrow the possibilities and discount the imponderables, thereby deepening troughs in the stream where the opinion-shapers feel most comfortable.  If these spinmeisters succeed in moving this or that trough closer to the opinions fashionable in their own circles, so much the better.  Their most important goal, however, is to preserve, protect, and defend the mass-mediated mainstream in which they are reckoned to be authoritative.<br />This &quot;dredging&quot; narrows the diversity of acceptable facts, beliefs, perspectives, and insights that will be carried in mass media.  As a consequence, novel critiques, original thinking, and perceptive syntheses usually cannot penetrate sequences of fabricated, exaggerated threats and reassurances that characterize everyday debates on television, the Internet, or radio and in newspapers and periodicals.  This conventional wisdom tended by the pundits not only amplifyies the problem that so many ordinary Americans know little about politics, government, their own country, and the world but also exacerbates the difficulty that so many people who trouble themselves to follow the news know so much that is not true.<br />Alterman deftly describes and documents how pundits set themselves up as experts by making themselves well known for being well known (to steal Daniel Boorstin's phrase).  Many of them know a little about a little.  Through marketing and self-promotion, they pose as knowing much about nearly everything.  The reader is first amused and then amazed at how little it takes for this columnist or that essayist to become a frequent guest on chatfests.  The more that the pundit pretends to know without actually risking his or her &quot;authority&quot; (often pundits have no &quot;authority&quot; in any subject to begin with; they have merely recognition or notoriety) and the more memorable their snappy patter, the more invitations that television is likely to extend.  If you have wondered how Alec Baldwin or Martin Sheen or Ann Coulter or Peggy Noonan came to populate cable &quot;news&quot; shows, this book will suggest some plausible hypothesies.<br />When Alterman documents how succinct phrases and other arts of punditry actually clash with genuine knowledge and merited authority, the reader begins to appreciate how the sound and fury of these media creations have diminished politics and impoverished discourse.<br />P.S.  Does anyone else suspect that the customer review from &quot;A reader from Alexandria, VA USA&quot; was crafted by some lefty to imply that one who disliked Alterman's book due to Alterman's writing would himself or herself write so poorly?	2004-01-19

Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly	Books	4	47	56	N	N	A Useful Reference	This book serves up poetic justice to Bill O'Reilly.  Mr. Hart calmly and usually persuasively shows how often Mr. O'Reilly puts the shuck on his viewers, listeners, or readers.  By the end of the book one must conclude that, if Mr. O'Reilly had a guest on &quot;The Factor&quot; who equivocated, prevaricated, or obfuscated as much and as often as Mr. O'Reilly does, the host would throw one of his tantrums.<br />On the other hand, Mr. O'Reilly broadcasts so much and writes so much that finding his mistakes is not very challenging and not revealing.  What is revealing are Mr. O'Reilly's attempts to escape from his own errors, inconsistencies, and hypocrisies.  O'Reilly wants to play the Tribune of the American People each night, but he also wants to be smarter than the average guy.  As a result, Mr. O'Reilly too often agrees with positions that ordinary folk who have not thought matters through accept but invents novel reasons or factoids to bolster those popular positions.  And, like any pundit, Mr. O'Reilly knows so much that is not true.<br />An advantage to Mr. Hart's compendium is that the author does not feel compelled to call O'Reilly a liar.  Mr. Hart does better than Mr. Franken (although Mr. Franken is funnier) because he does not call every misstep or misinterpretation a lie.  I have seldom caught Mr. O'Reilly in a flat-out lie, and I watch him regularly and listen to his &quot;Radio Factor.&quot;  Mr. O'Reilly instead looses blather and bombast on his listeners and viewers.  That is, he is frequently dead wrong but almost always quite sincere.<br />The author does a bit too little analysis, or else I'd give the volume five stars.  I would like to have seen more attention to the rhetorical techniques and logic-chopping in which Mr. O'Reilly engages.  Mr. Hart could do many readers and viewers a service by showing how a little knowledge of a few fallacies or intellectual bad habits would explain Mr. O'Reilly's antics.<br />I thought that Mr. Hart might havedevoted more space to Mr. O'Reilly's hypocrisy as well.  When he is bullying a guest or shouting over a speaker, Mr. O'Reilly reeks of the incivility and ill-breeding that he piously laments.  He rails about the excesses of Teddy Kennedy or others (and rightly so!) and how they are spoiling American politics.  Then he behaves boorishly and intimidates those who come on his show.  He profits from his perch on Fox News while ignoring much of the shock journalism and shlock that passes for content on Fox and other cable channels.  <br />Mostly, however, this book is terrific at showing how often Bill O'Reilly is talking through his hat.  Mr. O'Reilly is often the populist whom he plays on TV.  He has the vices of his virtues.  He wants viewers and listeners to believe that he knows much more than he knows (and occasionally much more than anyone could know)-- just like the loudmouth two barstools down.  He clings to whatever he has long believed despite all evidence to the contrary -- just like ordinary true believers do.  He denounces ideas new to him as ideological nonsense -- which saves him from admitting how mindlessly conservative he all too often is and how far he is from those conservatives who inspire admiration and belief for their learning and wisdom.<br />Taking the spin and the skin off O'Reilly is a public service!	2003-10-21

I would like to highlight one reason to read this book and suggest one reason for concern about the book.  <br />The most compelling reason to read this book is to see how easily some of the misleading statements might have been corrected by the authors skewered by Mr. Franken.  Perhaps the most revealing part of this book is that so many statements in the books of others are flat-out untruths.  [Whether they are lies is another issue!]  The authors, their editors, and their adoring fans appear utterly impervious to the principle that oen should only contribute reliable information to the public debate.  What may be worse, many of our fellow citizens seem indifferent to the specious or false information that some of the targets loose on the world.  Mr. Franken's volume, read in concert with similar works by Joe Conason and David Corn, suggests that some misrepresentation or mendacity is not even considered an ethical lapse any more.  Has our culture gotten so used to self-evident falsehoods that we do not even worry about spreading misinformation if it suits our purposes to do so?<br />The only concern that I raise is that Mr. Franken's satiric use of irony and other rhetorical devices provides him an escape route that he would not permit and has not permitted Ms. Coulter, Mr. O'Reilly, or President Bush.  Mr. Franken gets to say &quot;Just joshing&quot; or &quot;Can't you take a joke?&quot; when he veers over the line.  That gives him an easy out that he denies to others.  I hope that fair readers will consider this difference between the satirist and his sanctimonious targets.<br />Both the reason to read the book and the caveat about Mr. Franken's humor may tell readers much more about the sorry state of public discourse than they care to acknowledge!	2003-10-20

Moore	I agree with the criticism that Mr. Corn has compiled a book when he might have achieved a more revealing synthesis.<br />I do not mean to play down the significance of Mr. Corn's compilation.  The author documents lie after lie from sea to shining sea.  Mr. Corn enables us to marvel at the vituosity of the Bush Campaign in 2000: Al Gore came off as the liar when George W. Bush was already shucking and jiving far more.  The author also shows how the Bush Administration assumed, having gotten away with lying during primary and general campaigns and during the tussle over Florida, they could continue to fib and falsify with impunity.  <br />Why did all the President's women and men presume that they could stretch and distort and prevaricate about WMD and not be held to account?  Because they had yet to pay any price for any of their mendacity to date.  Smash Iraq, drive Hussein underground, and who will care that the Administration was hiding its whims behind whoppers?<br />Still, with more insight and elbow-grease, Mr. Corn might do more than document the whoppers.  First, the author might differentiate among fibs, fables, factoids, folderol, and fantasies.  I know of no evidence that President Bush does not believe seven impossible things each day before breakfast.  If Mr. Bush believes what he says, then he is not lying in any strong sense of the term.  Mr. Corn is not making fundamental distinctions that he must make if some charges of flat-out lying are to stick.<br />Second, Mr. Corn might have inventoried lies beyond what he did.  Does Bush lie more about domestic or foreign matters?  Had he lied more about the probable effects of his tax cuts or about the probable consequences of near-unilateralism?  Even some elementary categorizations beyond the obvious might have yielded insights.<br />Third, the author should have related the record of mendacity to context and correlates.  When and where does President Bush tell flat-out lies and when and where does he tend to rely on clever phrasings and anecdotes?  Does the President mislead more when the press is watching but make it up when the press is less evident?  <br />All the above said, I believe that Mr. Corn provided a valuable service in publishing the list.  I assume Mr. Corn will add to the list to make it a cumulative, dynamic reminder of just how cynical the President's handlers are and how gullible any sincere admirers of this president must be.  Because I assume that Mr. Corn will augment and perhaps enhance his project, I award four stars for the book that it might become.	2003-10-07

The cover of this book ought to have talked me out of purchasing it.  The contents talked me out of adding it to my library - too late.<br />Consider the blurb (which Judge Bork did not write): \\"While the actions of legislatures in America and other democarcies are closely watched and hotly debated, the power of judges is largely unchecked and unexamined.  For two centuries, judges have steadily expanded their authority, reaching far beyond their traditional responsibilities.\\"  If the publisher or the marketing staff got such nonsense from the book (which they might have by reading it), any educated reader must put the book back on the shelf and save his money.<br />The power of judges has been neither examined nor checked?  Judge Bork, President Nixon, Nathan Glazer, and a host of congresspeople and other lawyers opposed to BROWN v. BOARD or ROE v. WADE or Warren Court activism or Rehnquist Court activism have bellowed about judicial activism for half a century!  Judge Bork embarrassed himself with a book on the subject, THE TEMPTING OF AMERICA, that actual experts on constitutional law panned.  The power of judges - both in the United States and abroad - has been examined by many commentators both in the United States and abroad.  The power of judges to enforce their views is most assuredly checked: Massive Resistance; abortion regulations and the Hyde Amendment; continuing school prayer in public schools and other public venues; tort reforms; mandatory sentencing; wars over appointments to U. S. courts; the ousting of Rose Bird and two other California Justices; and other measures too numerous to list have circumscribed judges, lawyers, courts, and laws.<br />\\"For two centuries, judges have steadily expanded their authority, reaching far beyond their traditional responsibilities.\\"  Say what?  The expansion of judicial authority has hardly been steady, as even passing familiarity with any judicial doctrines would disclose to a second-day student at any law school.I doubt that one could even argue that the expansion of judicial power has been monotonic.<br />And what traditional responsibilities have judges reached beyond?  Have they assisted African Americans?  women?  the poor?  Oh no!  Thank heaven that segregationists, sexists, and other bigots have Judge Bork's assistance.<br />Through most of the history of the United States, judges and courts and the law have been profoundly conservative.  They have conserved advantages and privileges for overdogs who could employ counsel and disabilities for underdogs who had no hired legal guns.  I am hardly enthused about many of the developments that Judge Bork laments, but I am not so blinded by the conservatism we share as to complain about \\"judicial imperialism\\" whenever working folk or victims start to catch some breaks from a very few judges.<br />This book is not even worthy of assignment to high school students to highlight (as another reviewer already noted) the perils of political polemics masquerading as scholarly studies.  <br />The editorial page of the NEW YORK TRIBUNE opined that the DRED SCOTT decision was entitled to about as much moral sway as the majority of a Washington saloon.  In a like manner, I found in COERCING VIRTUE as much expertise and reason as on the average radio talk show.  Thus, COERCING VIRTUE continues the lousy research and illogical argumentation of Bork's previous work ever since a majority of the Senate observed that he was unworthy of the U. S. Supreme Court.	2003-10-01

In addition, most of the examples and allusions will strike modern Americans as dated and obscure. Nonetheless, Ellul saw long ago where moderns were headed. He saw that authoritarian use of modern technologies would mesmerize, stultify, and reduce humans to thralls, just as Orwell and Huxley, in far more hysterical prose, had dramatized.<br />Orwell's electronic miracles monitored citizens directly or indirectly. Huxley's miracles were far more therapeutic or medical. But routine surveillance or treatment is inefficient and overwhelms any state that would depend on omniscience or envelopment. Ellul foresaw tools both electronic and human that would so condition subject-audiences that close monitoring and careful prescriptions would be unneeded.<br />Ellul also argued that this &quot;Brave, New World&quot; could not but subvert democracy and decency. Once the will of the citizen is not his or her own, then democracy in any meaningful sense is at least devalued and perhaps transformed into reassuring internment.<br />Perhaps Ellul's most important insight was that the educated believed themselves immune to propaganda when, due to their proclivity for reading and watching news and other governmental outflow, such &quot;intellectuals&quot; were actually far more vulnerable than masses who did not receive propaganda as often.<br />So turn off the set and log off the internet and settle in with a truly life-changing read.	2003-09-16

Debunking is good because truth is good!<br />This book will please politically astute readers who long for retorts to crackpot conservatives [Coulter, D'Souza, Murray, and Horowitz, for examples] and will please those crackpots and others who will nitpick Mr. Conason to keep spinning ideology and partisanship.<br />This book will be most useful, however, for casual observers of politics who might have been taken in by broadcasts on talk radio or Fox.  Although Mr. Conason's book must compete with Al Franken's and David Corn's new books on conservative or Bush Administration mendacity, this book has the virtues one should expect of its author, a veteran journalist.  Conason provides context clearly and quickly, states the truth-stretching or falsehood(s) succinctly, then moves on to the next whopper.  In addition, Conason has targeted a larger group [the chattering class on the Right] than Mr. Franken [specific BS artists] or Mr. Corn [President Bush], so he has more alarming and more amusing blather from which to select.<br />As some reviewers below have noted, Conason misstates some details.  [If those reviewers were themselves more precise with language, spelling, grammar, and so on, I might be more disposed to take them seriously, if not their complaints.]  He writes that Steve Symms was Senator from Idaho later in the volume but places him in Utah early on [page 58], for example.  Such missteps should be corrected in later printings.  They do not undermine the thesis of BIG LIES.<br />Conason does go over the top in places, which makes him resemble palely those whom he attacks.  For example, Conason tasks John Ashcroft for likening to traitors those who, in objecting to the USA PATRIOT Act, unduly alarm the populace [page 102].  Although I agree that Ashcroft was out of line, Conason slightly misinterprets Ashcroft's language, which was carefully phrased to give Ashcroft an escape.  Conason writes that Ashcroft equated dissent with treason, \\" ... the perennial answer of the authoritarian ruler, who quite often believes he was chosen by God.\\"  Conason should calm down lest he furnish too much ammunition for the prevaricators whom he will rile with his book.<br />Overall, I am delighted to find in one volume documentation of prevariacation, which seems rampant in our civil discourse.

US	52933713	R3D5HQBESRKSSP	0195147561	463881838	Regulating Tobacco	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Very useful and eclectic	This collection of essays is practical and wide-ranging.  The editors have assembled essays from academics who study law, politics, public health, and economics.  The information is reliable and current.  The charts are easy to understand.  The writing is almost always clear, but arguments and analyses will challenge newcomers and provoke old hands.<br />Essays concern the regulation of tobacco by means of international and domestic politics, taxes, marketing, and litigation, as well as efforts to reduce injuries to smokers and availability to youths.  Every essay complements the whole.  Each chapter features at least some history to summarize the performance of policies to date.  The index will expedite use of the book as for building bibliographies, as will the abundant references and footnotes.<br />I award only four stars because some of the chapters go too far and some not far enough.  Dr. Jack Slade calls the marketing of tobacco &quot;peculiar&quot; despite the fact that the appeal of tobacco companies to freedom of choice is a position accepted by 75-80% of Americans, to the best of my information.  Dr. Robert Kagan and his co-author conclude on page 32 that &quot;On balance, contemporary U. S. tobacco policy seems to reflect American public opinion much more than it does the preference set of either the tobacco industry, public health activists, or antitobacco lawyers.&quot;  Try writing that &quot;duh!&quot; conclusion in a term paper and see what grade you get when the teacher stops guffawing.  Not only is that contention so obvious as to be risable, but it also misleads.  Even if tobacco companies have not gotten all that they wanted, they have made billions by addicting young people to known carcinogens.  Policy may long have reflected tobacco power far more than public health activism or litigation, ya think?<br />Still, this is a terrific resource.	2002-04-16

Hans's assessments of misinformation and disinformation about the civil jury may do little to overcome the propaganda of tort reformers except among well-informed citizens, but citizen who cares to learn more about courts and law than about rhetoric will profit from her book. Hans, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware, tests claims about how juries treat businesses in civil cases. She assembles myriad charges, and then she acquits the civil jury system of nearly every specification. She often establishes a preponderance of evidence opposite to criticisms of civil juries.<br />The author proceeds so methodically and dispassionately as to win over every informed and open-minded reader. If there are no \\"Perry Mason\\" moments at which witnesses break down and admit that they were making it up as they went along, the \\"testimony\\" of purported experts is discredited all the more effectively by Professor Hans's fastidious craft and consistent fairness. (The author does establish that jurors tend to believe horror stories that have been discredited and sloganeering against litigants and lawyers, so jurors might still be derided for gullibility, just not by those who fabricate the tales and spread the slanders.<br />Professor Hans's findings diverge from common beliefs because she undertakes to replace anecdotes and assumptions with information and evidence. Her results, almost always consistent with research to date, issue from three methods of inquiry. The author interviewed 269 jurors from 36 civil cases that involved businesses or corporations and were tried to a verdict or a hung jury. She conducted a statewide survey of respondents' views of business regulation and civil litigation. In addition, she designed experiments with mock juries to focus on telling variables and contexts. Given this methodical and methodological resourcefulness, her findings must instill great confidence.<br />Hans finds that jurors are suspiciousand even dismissive of victims and their grievances. Critics who assumed or asserted the ignorance of jurors may thereby have overlooked what jurors know well: everyday realities and everyday people. Because jurors believe that they understand what reasonable persons will or should do, plaintiffs often find civil juries a tough audience. Mindful that whiners and chiselers abound, jurors often begin cases presuming the plaintiff's culpability and become persuaded of the defendant's liability only slowly, reluctantly, and judiciously.<br />A few of Professor Hans's findings may pleasee tort reformers, however. Professor Hans shows that jurors expect more of corporate defendants than they do of ordinary individuals. Business defendants are expected to measure up to norms that physicians and other professionals must meet to avoid charges of malpractice. Dr. Hans reminds her readers that this tendency may be true outside the United States: Japanese jurors too tend to expect corporations to anticipate and to avert what less knowledgeable and less organized defendants might be forgiven for not having foreseen.<br />Hans concludes that juries simply are not pro-plaintiff as a general matter. She concedes that sympathy for civil plaintiffs and civil complaints may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. On the whole, however, she finds too little evidence for any pro-plaintiff biases among civil jurors. The evidence that Professor Hans and others have discovered, then, runs decidedly opposite to the common assertion that juries favor Davids over Goliaths.<br />Nor are most jurors anti-business, as those sympathetic to Goliath (or other Philistines) have insisted. When jurors expressed hostility towards business defendants, their judgments were explicitly based on outrages in particular cases.<br />The myth of \\"Robin Hood\\" juries that use trials to redistribute wealth found little support as well.  However useful political  invocations of \\"Robin Hood\\" juries may be, in practice such juries turn out to be about as fictitious as their namesake.<br />By taking critics seriously, Professor Hans has undermined their criticisms and credibility in a concise and compelling manner. Her labors need not, of course, affect attacks on civil juries or civil justice, since many or most of those attacks depend so little on valid premises and so much on expedient presuppositions. Nonetheless, Professor Hans has made it harder for the well-informed to claim that their opinions of the civil jury are based on expertise or experience rather than expedience.	2002-04-05

I also expected him to repeat his apology to President Clinton.<br />I did not expect Brock to name names and supply facts.  The names and facts have yet to be contested, although I expect that Brock must have distorted this detail or misstated that factlet.  If Brock's old buddies on the Right begin to quibble with the specifics the way Brock did with the particulars of the authors of STRANGE JUSTICE (who exposed Brock's and Thomas's tricks), they will tacitly admit that they cannot effectively dismiss Brock's larger point.<br />That larger point is that the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" of which Senator Clinton complained is neither widely based enough to be vast nor organized enough to be a conspiracy but is nonetheless a malevolent machine for destruction of liberals real (Sen. Clinton) and imagined (President Clinton).<br />The most revealing tidbits in the book concern officeholders, who have some explaining to do.  Brock has \\"outed\\" their then-latent but now-patent efforts to slur and to smear.  I shall not name the culrpits in this review, but I urge readers to see what certain Bush- and Reagan-appointees were doing in their spare time.  Particularly significant are the activities of members of the Federalist Society (touted as a better organization for rating judicial appointees than the American Bar Association) and other organizations and agents who flatter themselves as being above the skullduggery of radio hosts and reactionary media.<br />No American need believe every bit of this book to profit from it.  Even if Brock got some things wrong, the sheer bulk of the case he assembles is overwhelming....	2002-03-26
US	52933713	R225YEO1CKBH2I	0226752917	860973783	When Law Goes Pop: The Vanishing Line between Law and Popular Culture	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Much Better as a Reference than as a Read	Professor Richard Sherwin concludes his book with an explicit statement of his thesis, the usual format for mysteries but not for academic studies.  If you are a reader who prefers to know where the case studies are headed before reading the case studies, you might do well to read the last chapter first.  I hesitate to advise readers to do so, however.  Many of Professor Sherwin's analyses of one or a few movies are rich with insight and will inform, enlighten, and even entertain.  In contrast, his theoretical contribution (affirmative postmodern theory) is too skimpy to justify a place in my library.  Thus, I recommend that readers locate this book in a local library and consult it regarding legal matters in popular culture.<br />I recommend Mr. Sherwin's analysis of Errol Morris's &quot;The Thin Blue Line.&quot;  I shall never watch or show that classic without thinking about Professor Sherwin?s gloss thereon.  I disagree with his comparison of the older and younger versions of &quot;Cape Fear.&quot;  I suspected that each of his characterizations of one film might just as easily be asserted about the other, but he held my interest and impelled me to watch both versions again.  Mr. Sherwin appears to believe that films of David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino tell us much about theories or institutions of law and law enforcement.  I was not convinced but found the argument interesting.<br />I recommend highly Sherwin's comparison of the &quot;jigsaw puzzle&quot; closing of Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden in the first Simpson trial to the heroic saga narratives favored by Johnnie Cochran and Gerry Spence.  Sherwin is especially good at exposing Mr. Spence's skill.  Mr. Spence appears to be the shrewd country lawyer whom he plays on television.<br />I also recommend Sherwin's account of myth making in famous cases of the 19th and 20th centuries, although consideration of landmarks of sensationalism calls into question just when the law began to go &quot;pop.&quot;<br />I recommend that readers skip the numerous lists of questions with which Mr. Sherwin mars his manuscript.  I could never be certain where the questions were headed and where I was supposed to the find the answers, if any.  Readers should be underwhelmed as well by Mr. Sherwin's generalization from aberrations, including the aforementioned Simpson trial.  In these matters, Mr. Sherwin seems to succumb to pop law and to see the world in a sound bite of the erstwhile &quot;Rivera Live.&quot;  <br />Most of all, I urge readers to overlook his every attempt to generalize about law and legal institutions from movies.  As I have said, Mr. Sherwin's analyses of movies are intriguing.  However, getting from the movies analyzed to legal institutions is no minor trick.  When Mr. Sherwin would generalize to the legal culture from this or that trend that he claims to see in this or that movie, the reader should indulge his impulse to attend to the movie critique and to ignore the alleged social criticism that, it appears, the author believes his cinematic analyses justify.  Mr. Sherwin's methodological justification for this twist on cinematic verity is almost self-satire:  &quot;My working assumption is that film, like notorious cases, provides a reasonably reliable indicator of shared, conflicted, and newly emerging beliefs, values, and expectations&quot;(p. 171).  With working assumptions such as that, what hypothesis wouldn't work out?<br />Mr. Sherwin separates postmodern sheep from postmodern goats, but the author's renditions of postmodernism seemed to create multiple Potemkin Villages.  The specter of skeptical postmodernism may haunt some in the Western world, but Mr. Sherwin's manifesto will strike most readers as disjointed and overwrought.	2002-01-29

That compendium is very useful.  However, any thorough reader would have to supplement it with readings that make the case for tort reform more effectively and more accurately than the authors do.<br />Although tort reformers, who distort so often, deserve caricature as a form of poetic justice, the authors crafted no evenhanded approach to guide beginners through tort law.  Perhaps the best use of this book would be as a case-study of how adversarial settings bring out deception and trickiness on every side.  <br />Koenig and Rustad were most cogent in their criticisms of popularized arguments for tort reform, but in advancing the case for current law and policy, the authors sometimes imitated tort reformers? reductionism, anecdotism, and sophism.<BR>   <BR>Koenig and Rustad?s defense may persuade readers that tort reformers have been guilty of false and fallacious argumentation but may not convince many readers that Koenig or Rustad have behaved much better than those whom they critique.  <br />The chapters that addressed gender justice, patients? rights, and product safety effectively raised overlooked issues.  Chapter Three showed how differences and disadvantages related to sex condition civil law in general and torts in particular; Chapter Four demystified myths about medical malpractice; Chapter Five stretched a few guidelines for manufacturing safe and honest products into ten commandments for avoiding products-liability suits and judgments.  Each chapter, however, overlooked issues that tort reformers must and should raise.  Chapter Three celebrated compensation of victims of silicone implants without acknowledging the judgmentsof epidemiologists and judges that such compensation hinged on poor science or no science.  In Chapter Four the authors cited the Harvard Study to show that perhaps one out of one hundred victims of documented malpractice sued, but did not admit that the same study revealed three or four unwarranted medical malpractice suits for every one the study?s experts found to be warranted.  The authors supplanted reformers? horror stories about frivolous litigation and outrageous results with their 10 Commandments but should have admitted alarming exceptions to each of the authors? ten commandments.<br />In sum, not a very balanced presentation.  If academics behave like this, why shouldn't legislators misbehave?	2002-01-28

She did not claim that the CAT scan erased her psychic powers.  She sued for malpractice after a hospital resident injected her with an iodine contrast dye to which Ms. Haimes had told the doctor she was allergic.  The immediate results were too gruesome to detail here.  Over the next ten years, Ms. Haimes suffered from intense headaches.  She could no longer conduct her business, which consisted largely of reading people's auras.<br />If you would like to learn about the real case, this book is accessible and interesting.<br />... Mr. Haimes (Judith's husband) has meticulously reproduced details of testimony and evidence from the transcript of the trial to show what the case was actually about and why eight jurors awarded Ms. Haimes damages.

Moreover, Ms. Haimes's services to the FBI and other law enforcement agents will be hard to explain unless one believes that she has some special sensitivities.<br />Irrespective of the reader's judgment about psychic powers, this book offers a human-scale account of an extraordinary individual striving to get some ordinary justice from a negligent physician.	2002-01-28

They are correct that this book would have been better were it about the jury or the experience of judgment more and about the author and his high opinion of himself less.  <br />I was amazed and amused by the pedantry and pretensions, but I am academic and therefore used to that.  What I was less amused but more amazed to discover was that a writer who so esteemed himself throughout the monograph cannot write well.  I should have seen this coming, however.  The author stated at the beginning that this was his account of his experiences.  As I read, I confirmed that this was a book about Mr. Burnett into which the criminal case, the judge, the lawyers, the accused, the evidence, the courthouse staff, and other jurors would intrude from time to time.  Given Burnett's fascination with his mental prowess and process, what I regarded as digressions he would have seen as the essences.<br />Do not buy this book.  Go to a public library and get ANATOMY OF A JURY by Seymour Wishman or secure a copy of a &quot;Frontline&quot; cassette called &quot;Inside the Jury Room.&quot;  That &quot;Frontline&quot; had a pretentious academic, but he was not allowed to dominate.<br />If you must look at this book, examine it at the bookstore.  Skip the parts about what Mr. Burnett ate [please do not believe that I am kidding] and find references to subjects about which you might care.  Read those quickly.  You can push through this book in an hour or so.	2002-01-22

However, most such books will be polemics that exude more bias than the medium or media that they attack.<br />This book, in contrast, does not pretend to find the one, great bias that is ruining the press.  Rather, ten journalists provide their experiences in the increasingly commercialized business of news.<br />You may read about small weeklies and about Washington bureaus.<br />You may read about racial integration in the newsroom and why it has fallen short.<br />You may read about social, political, and commercial influences obvious and insidious that shape what you read, hear, and/or see, but -- more important -- that select what you cannot read, hear, and/or see.

I recommend it to everyone as a quick read that will fuel whatever side of the arguments the reader favors.<br />The author focuses on litigators who tried to hold tobacco companies responsible for some of the harms from which the companies [and governments] have profited.  Many of those litigators were flush with money derived from suits over asbestos or other faulty products, so this book features the swashbuckling lawyering familiar from the plaintiffs' attorney in A CIVIL ACTION.  If the reader stereotypes lawyers as greedy parasites, that reader will find ample examples in this book.  On the other hand, readers open to the idea that little folks sometimes get something resembling justice through lawsuits or not at all may regard the trial lawyers as the last hope for many underdogs -- not perfect by any means, but better than no champions at all.<br />Some litigators were motivated by other values than money or in addition to money, so the reader whose mind has not been poisoned against all lawyers will find attorneys acting on principles or ideals.<br />Readers unaware of the secrets and misbehavior of the tobacco companies should probably read about those companies in greater detail elsewhere, but this book provides a deft summary of intimidation, perjury, junk science, public relations, and other corporate viciousness.  <br />Readers who emphasize that Big Tobacco deals a legal drug that users are free to reject will find little sympathy for that view in this book, but they will find ample evidence of the misbehavior of critics of Big Tobacco.<br />Readers who believe that plaintiffs file frivolous suits to shake down moneyed defendants every day will learn just how hard it is to get any money from economic powers.<br />Readers who suspect that economic clout translates to legal and litigational prowess will find ways in which that is both true and false.  Such readers will learn that black and white views do not adequately convey the complexity of economic powers.<br />It is true that one ends this book without a tidy ending to this ongoing struggle.  Even that, however, is an important lesson about tobacco politics.	2002-01-08

Politics	I do not want to repeat too much that other reviewers have said better than I can or shall.<br />Still, this is a very readable introduction to the politics of regulation.  More important, I believe it to be an excellent civics text.<br />Because Big Tobacco involved and still involves public relations, advertising, lobbying, coercion, litigation, subsidization of junk science, campaign contributions, localism, and ideology, Dr. Kessler's narrative implicates each branch of government and each arena of political influence.  That makes it an introduction to U. S. government.<br />Moreover, each branch, each locality, and every group is shown to comprise at least reasonably principled actors and utterly craven characters.  This introduction to U. S. politics and government, it follows, reveals heroes to be emulated as well as villains to be excoriated.  That makes it a balanced introduction to U. S. government.<br />This volume also features science versus pseudo-science; lofty exhortations calling on Americans to be their better selves versus crass bloviations calling on Americans to look the other way during a plague of cancer and emphysema; and proof that Bill Clinton hardly invented hair-splitting and mendacity and that the Nixon Administration did not invent the non-denial denial. That makes it a wide-ranging [but not comprehensive] introduction to U. S. government.<br />This is no fairy tale, however.  The travail involved in getting tobacco executives to admit what everyone else knew to be true should frighten every reader about what &quot;authorities&quot; tell us.  That scientists as well as lawyers, politicians, and lobbyists were entangled in the deceits necessary to preserve an empire that made billions from addicting citizens in the United States and abroad should give every American pause.  That makes it a relaistic and cautionary introduction to U. S. government.<br />Review the reviews below mine: if anti-smoking crusaders are dissatisfied with their prominence in this book, but at least one free-marketeer is willing to slander Dr. Kessler as a socialist who is deeply suspicious of all business and markets [he isn't], then Kessler must have maintained at least some impartiality.  Judged by its few detractors, this must be a great read.  It is.	2001-10-30

Those who have read about the Court avidly or extensively will not find much here that is new, but that tends to validate what Dean says.  Those who knew little about President Nixon or the politics of appointments in the Nixon Era will find more than a few fascinating stories.  <br />Mr. Dean was a lawyer working in the White House.  Thus, he was privy to many of the machinations of the Nixon Administration.  If Mr. Dean is liable to be suspected of repenting or exaggerating his role, he may be at least presumed to be an authority.<br />One of Mr. Dean's overarching points is that Mr. Rehnquist was appointed to the Court nearly accidentally.  The naive reader will be startled to see how little thought went into the selection, how late in the process that thought came about, and how few second thoughts were lavished on the selection once it was made.<br />In addition, the reader will be amused by the cavalier banter that passed for analysis between Nixon and his various sounding boards.  Dean has reproduced dialogue from the White House tapes, so the quotations appear to be authoritative.<br />The &quot;might have beens&quot; are too delicious to spoil in this review.  Dean deftly introduces each possibility with a capsule description so that readers who did not pay much attention in 1971 may appreciate who was who.<br />No one should be surprised to read that Nixon was prejudiced against blacks, Jews, and women, but the vehemence with which Nixon spews stereotypes startles even thirty years later.<br />Dean concludes that Rehnquist, in 1971 and 1986, fibbed his way thorough difficulties.  The splendid irony that the fellow who presided over Clinton's trial in the Senate in 1999 had perjured himself onto the Court and into the Chief Justiceship is hardly news.  To believe Rehnquist's denials concerning challenging minority voters in Arizona in the 1960s or concerning his memorandum urging the justices to uphold &quot;separate but equal&quot; as good law required muscular denial.  [Dean does not raise the matter of the restrictive covenant on Rehnquist's property.]  Those familiar with these issues will find very little new.  However, those new to the matter will find in the &quot;Afterword&quot; a concise but articulate discussion of why Rehnquist's denials were unbelievable.<br />What readers may not gather from Dean's prose, however, is that, in a roundabout way, the system worked.  Stymied by the American Bar Association [which found Nixon's first few candidates to be unqualified or unimpressive] and stung by mass media attacks on Nixon's attempts to appoint mediocrities, Nixon felt compelled to go for a little stature with predictable ideology.  Rehnquist was a predictable conservative.  He was also many cuts above the sorts of people with whom Nixon wanted to saddle the Court.	2001-10-04

Gullible souls, beware!<br />Embarrassing as it should be for someone who went to law school to rely on stories to make an argument, it is worse to get the stories wrong.  <br />If you were thinking of purchasing this compendium, page through it at a bookstore to see if you can square one telling of the McDonald's Coffee Lady story with another in the book.  No reference to that case in this book is entirely accurate, but that is not my point.  My point is that Mr. Howard did not even trouble himself to make his misinformation in one part of the book match his misinformation in another part of the same book.  Now that's sloppy, counselor!<br />If Mr. Howard cannot get correct a story that was in many papers and magazines, what must a reader think about tales that Mr. Howard attributes to this or that local paper?<br />Don't cry for Mr. Howard, however.  He'll make money off readers who do not ask whether stories are true.  Since his argument suits prejudices about lawyers and law, any number of rubes will grasp at his story telling.<br />Don't you be one of them!	2001-09-28

Bushisms: The Slate Book of Accidental Wit and Wisdom of Our 43rd President	Books	4	41	64	N	N	Why is Dubya just a heartbeat from the Presidency?	The whining of the Right to the contrary notwithstanding, this book shows that the Supreme Court selected a man who cannot qualify as literate if one's standard for literacy exceeds reading the Washington Times or, with concentration, Our Weekly Reader.<br />The great benefit of this book is to provide a response to silliness about how truth and decency have entered the White House as Dubya replaces Bubba.  Even if Dubya were truthful about his past and his tax cut and even if he were more decent than he appeared when slandering McCain, are there so few truthful, decent women and men available that we had to settle for an ignoramus who shames Yale and Harvard by showing how affirmative action for the progeny of plutocrats worked? <br />Yes, President Bubba was given to splitting hairs on the meaning(s) of &quot;is.&quot;  Granted, President Dubya would never do that.  Because Clinton's distinction relied on a verb's tense, Bush 43 could not split that hair.  He would definitely not take advantage of the questioner's stupidity in relying on the present tense because Dubya does not understand verbs' tenses.<br />This book shows the other matters that have eluded our accidental leader in his first half-century of non-learning.  Yes, some of the entries are not very revealing.  Some are mere slips of the tongue.  However, when so many flubs and howlers bedevil a candidate for high office even when he is as programmed as Bush was, the idiocies begin to form a pattern.<br />I award only four stars because I agree with Mark Crispin Miller that merely ridiculing Dubya misses the larger point.  Dubya's mistakes too often obscure the meanness and mendacity that underlie his candidacy and his presidency.  President Bush, that is, distracts citizens by being even more of a bonehead than Vice President Quayle was or is.  While Letterman and Leno and Maher are guffawing, the advisors to the First Twit are running the country.  I doubt that they will do more harm than Bubba's criminals, but I see no reason to suppose that they will do less.<br />Do you imagine that George H. W. Bush selected J. Danforth Quayle to lower the bar to such a degree that George W. Bush would seem not so bad?	2001-09-07

Given a choice of Buchanan, Bush, Gore, Nader, or others in 2000, the mystery is why any punchcard had even a dimple!<br />On the negative side, Miller \\"over-reads\\" various of Bush's statements.  When we read too closely the remarks of ANYONE who is ad-libbing, we risk unfairness.  When we read microscopically the ad libs of a man who -- Miller argues -- is utterly inept at English, we are grossly unfair.  If President Bush is as inarticulate as Miller claims, then Miller should not read the president's remarks literally or interpret them Talmudically.  Dr. Miller errs (purposely or not) when he takes the President at his exact words to set up a devastating response.  To be fair to Mr. Bush, Miller should have conceded what the president probably meant to say.<br />In addition, I was put off by some of the leftish cant in this book.  Dr. Miller should be aiming to reveal what the election of an illiterate says about our politics and our polity.  The more that he presumes verities that strike the middle and the right as untrue, the more that Miller circumscribes the audience for his analyses.	2001-08-03

Yes, much evidence that pointed to Simpson's guilt never made it into the courtroom and never reached the jurors.  Judge Ito's rulings, prosecutorial misconduct, and LAPD's ineptitude all played a role. And yes, Simpson participated in the murders beyond any doubt.<br />Yet jurors entertained reasonable doubts precisely because of some of Vannatter's testimony and mishandling of evidence. This puzzle points to some paradoxes at the heart of this book.<br />Vannatter claimed that when the four detectives -- the usual complement for notifying a man who is not longer next of kin that his ex is dead -- invaded Simpson's estate, Simpson was not a suspect.  This is paradox one.  If Simpson were not a suspect by the time the four got to his place, then the four were incompetent detectives.  If Simpson was a suspect, then the four precipitated a search as illegal as the one they conducted after Vannatter lied to get a search warrant.  So which is it?  Liar or incompetent?<br />In addition, Vannatter drove about LA with Simpson's blood for no good reason that he even he can conjure.  You do not have to be Jackie Chiles or Johnnie Cochran to find that inexplicable road trip to be explicable in a way that helps Simpson.  The second paradox to be highlighted, then, is that Vannatter dismissed himself!<br />In sum, this book poses a third paradox.  If the reader is credulous enough to believe these Keystone Kops, the reader is credulous enough to believe Simpson's lawyers.  Hmmmmmmmmm!	2001-07-31

They revealed him to be a liar on the stand, so what should we expect Fuhrman's reaction to be?  <br />...This is a very useful volume.<br />Fuhrman's account of the crime scene is devastating, not just to myriad theories floated by the Dream Team (that is the job of criminal defense), but far more to reputations of the police and prosectutors.  If any part of Fuhrman's account is true, those who \\"processed\\" the crime scene missed or destroyed evidence more compelling than some evidence that they trumpeted in court.  Fuhrman asserts that the blue-black sweatsuit should have been booked into evidence.  He makes it clear that the bloody spot on the Bundy back gate was a thumbprint.  As another reviewer has observed, such evidence would have defeated anything the Dream Team could concoct.<br />For these and other reasons, I urge you to read this book to get in better perspective just how lousy the gathering and presentation of evidence were -- and had to be if O. J. was to walk.  Do NOT slander the jurors until you see just how much of the most powerful evidence the prosecutors and criminalists and police managed to keep out of court.<br />As you read, never forget that Fuhrman lied and that he appeared willing to stand by as Marcia Clark and her team tried to destroy a woman who would testify to Fuhrman's racism.  For all his ploys to gain the reader's sympathy, Fuhrman must admit that he was willing to stand by while the prosecutors demonized a woman who has to this day not been shown ever to have lied.  <br />As you read, never forget that that woman and others were prepared to substantiate Mr. Fuhrman's racism.  Recall as well that Fuhrman had claimed that his racial animosities interefered with his work.  If the Dream Team demonized Fuhrman -- and I believe that they did -- they accentuated what was already present.<br />I am not sure how much Fuhrman's disgrace at the trial mattered, for the jurors have long since made it clear that they did not believe him anyway.  As I listened to Fuhrman deny having used the \\"n-word\\" in the last decade, I howled in derision.  I was encouraged to learn that the jurors silently drew the same conclusions.<br />Neither Fuhrman nor Vannatter was very credible on the search of Simpson's premises, so we cannot have any certainty that Furhman did any further harm by taking the Fifth.  Indeed, to read much of this case is to learn that the case was almost certainly lost by summer of 1995.<br />If you read and accept Fuhrman's assertions, you will see that the case may have been lost by the end of summer of 1994.	2001-07-31

I doubt that any will create analyses as understandable as this book, however.<br />The best way to read Dershowitz's book is in combination with Richard Posner's BREAKING THE DEADLOCK.  Posner is brilliant, but he had to use verbal gymnastics and conjure crises to attempt to justify what the Supreme Court did.  Dershowitz skewers the Supreme Court far more directly and persuasively.  I found that contrast telling.  If Posner must pile presumption upon presumption and stratagem upon stratagem to defend the result of Bush v. Gore -- remember!  Even Posner must concede that the Court's reasoning was laughable -- and Dershowitz may straightforwardly contradict both the Court and Posner with less cunning and cleverness, the style of the books alone tells the reader a good deal.<br />Dershowitz's defense of the Florida Supreme Court and his demonization of Ms. Harris are not as persuasive as the rest of his book.  Judge Posner does a better job of showing that Ms. Harris had a presumption in her favor as Secretary of State.  Yes, she gives every evidence of being a GOP hack, but find me someone in the whole Florida mess who behaved honorably.  <br />Mr. Dershowitz has all too often been a mouthpiece for unworthies as well.  When he serves as a criminal-justice lawyer, his job is to press for his client.  However, when he writes books, Mr. Dershowitz should be more dispassionate.  He gives in to his polemmical side too often for me to award five stars.<br />That qualification having been logged, SUPREME INJUSTICE is the best analysis of the jurisprudential hijinks of November-December 2000 that I have read.	2001-07-30

The account herein may be exactly what Darden's reasoning was.  If so, more's the pity!  Darden did not want to let the Dream Team run a scam so he ran it for them?  Good thinking!<br />Dershowitz's account of the glove incident, baffling though I find that account, is superior: F. Lee Bailey impugned Darden's manhood and Darden, like a rube, fell for it.<br />Of course, the glove demonstration did not much impress anyone (including the jurors, I suspect) beyond showing that the Amateur Hour had returned to television.  <br />Darden's rank speculations about Simpson's motives are no compelling in this book than they were in the trial.<br />In sum, read this book if you would understand just how incredible the prosecutors were.	2001-07-23

Mr. Goldberg's written rendition of the evidence is unpersuasive when it is not half-clever. Mr. Goldberg should hold himself in contempt if this is the best he could do.<br />As clueless as Mr. Goldberg seemed to have been during the trial, his recounting of the Thano Peratis tape -- they would have been better off showing \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" than that home movie -- and of the prosecution's unwillingness even to produce the boob who botched the autopsy represent a stunning lack of awareness.<br />If you would understand the scientific evidence supporting the prosecution, read Rantala's O. J. UNMASKED. If you would understand how such evidence got negated, read Dershowitz's REASONABLE DOUBTS or KILLING TIME or A PROBLEM OF EVIDENCE.<br />To paraphrase Mr. Books (John Wayne) in \\"The Shootist,\\" Mr. Goldberg might look for a different line of work, because this one doesn't suit him.	2001-07-23

This is the book for you if you are less skeptical than those imprisoned on the jury for the Simpson criminal trial.  Ms. Clark could not sell herself or her case to them.  Now she has taken millions in advance to try to sell herself and her case to those who do not know what happened in the courtroom.<br />I own more than forty books that are, all or in part, about the Simpson trial or trials.  Ms. Clark's -- alas! -- is not the worst of the lot, but it is far from the best of the lot.  From the point of view of the prosecution, even prominent blowhard Vincent Bugliosi is more persuasive.  If you would learn why the jurors would have been derelict had they not acquitted Simpson, read Dershowitz's book or, even better, read KILLING TIME.<br />Ms. Clark, it appears from her book, was unable or unwilling to surrender either the timeline that made little sense or the police officers who told little lies.  She phased herself out of her own case for weeks while incompetents made a hash of the DNA evidence.  She dissembled about child care, mugged for the cameras, and made a dozen debilitating mistakes and then, in this book, blames Judge Ito.  Judge Ito was, I agree, no month in the country; but Marcia was not even a Sunday drive.  If I were foolish enough to step into a ring with Mike Tyson, I would never last a minute, but I could hope he would not knock me so senseless as to blame my loss on the referee.<br />Ms. Clark had better come to grips with two statements that I regard as facts.  One, O. J. Simpson killed or participated in the killing of one or both victims.  Two, O. J. Simpson got away with his crimes due to the ineptitude, stubbornness, and childishness of Marcia Clark more than any other factor (except his money).	2001-07-23

Such anecdotal evidence is not compelling but can serve as a wakeup call.<br />The author lays out laws of criminal justice, not as portrayed in  books or ideals, but as practiced in courtrooms.  The most telling of these is the last -- no one wants justice.  To be sure, that law is imprecisely put.  What Dershowitz means is that, in an adversary system, almost no participant wants to do justice more than she or he wants to win.<br />Why might such an insight matter?  Well, when I listened to Marcia Clark and Geraldo Rivera and others whine about O.J., I was nonplussed to endure their cant about the search for justice. When Johnnie Cochran and Robert Shapiro packaged their defense as the pursuit of justice, I cringed.  If Clark and the prosecutors or Bob and Johnnie were seeking justice, what were they doing in court?  You don't look for filet mignon in a hindo diner!<br />Dershowitz need not convince any reader that the criminal justice system is as flawed or that Dershowitz is as flawless as the book pretends.  Nonetheless, the read will be an enlightening, entertaining call to see and think anew.	2001-07-23

Mr. Bugliosi shows why President Bush would do better on &#34;The Weakest Link&#34; than the prosecutors did on &#34;The Judge Ito Show.&#34; Bugliosi's criticisms of the jurors are as baseless in this book as they were during his tours of Geraldo's and other shows.

If you count that as a bias, then you must consider paying attention and retaining information to be vices.<br />The strength of her book, however, is not her fervent belief that O.

The book is almost always understandable even by those who have little background in constitutional law.<br />I recommend this book highly even though by the end of my reading I concluded that Judge Posner only established anew that he is one of the cleverest fellows whose books I have been privileged to read and that even he could not make any sense of the appellate hijinks of the U. S. Supreme Court or the Florida Supreme Court.<br />Assuming that they read books more adroitly than directions or ballots, former Vice President Gore's supporters will want to pore over this book to discover how poorly reasoned and defended the ultimate decision of the U. S. Supreme Court was.  Although Posner pronounces the RESULT to be the best way out of a crisis, such result-oriented reasoning has for decades been exactly what law students were supposed to be trained NOT to engage in.  Readers who are not familiar with Posner's ideas about judicial pragmatism will not quite appreciate the originality and brilliance of Posner's solutions to a treacherous case, but they should be impressed at his candor and insight.<br />As flawed as I find it to be, Posner's defense of the RESULT is far more persuasive than anything that the justices penned.  Posner dismisses seven justices' alleged reliance on the equal protection argument.  He fails to show -- as, for example, Vincent Bugliosi does in his over-the-top book on the same subject -- that then-Governor Bush had no standing to assert the equal protection rights or interests of any voters, but most readers will not know about standing and will not care.<br />Instead, Posner makes the less technical but compelling point that any violation of equal protection that the justice might have found or imagined in manual recount would have been present in the variety of modes of counting ballots both in Florida and inevery other state in every other election.  On this issue Posner sold me.  Other than that the justices' argument makes no sense to anyone who can read and understand it, the equal protection argument was a terrific effort that might barely have passed in a constitutional law course if the professor was groggy while reading the exam.  Well done, Supremes!<br />Supporters of President Bush will appreciate Posner's demolition of the sloppy work of the Florida Supreme Court.  Although Posner indulges in strained word play with regard to &quot;tabulation&quot; as it is used in Florida's statutes, I found his arguments in support of the Florida Secretary of State's discretion to be terrific.  I believe Posner that Florida law clearly authorized Ms. Harris to steal the election.  Hence, she stole it fair and square.  While the Florida Supreme Court may have had democratic-republican mores and ideals on its side, it did not come up with a good reason to have set aside Ms. Harris's reasonable determination.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Posner's main point -- that the U. S. Supreme Court had to break the deadlock to avoid a constitutional crisis -- justifies expediency to save the republic from the processes stated in the Supreme Law of the Land.  Such a victory through expedience may be worse than any crises or defeats that Posner dreams up.  [He is a clever guy!  Some of his imaginings are beauts!]  <br />If one may disregard or elude the law to save the republic from processes that the law requires, then what did the Florida Supreme Court do that the Supremes did not end up doing?  If one follows Posner's logic, the lawless Florida Supremes were not wrong because they were lawless [and Posner convinces me that they were]; they were wrong because their lawlessness was not the final lawlessness.  The U. S. Supreme Court was correct in its lawlessness because there was no appeal from that Court.  Does Posner's result-oriented approach work best when litigants have nowhere else togo?<br />In my reading, then, Posner's attack on the Florida court for its lawless escape from a crisis provides ample reason to attack the U. S. court for its lawless escape.  If I am correct, Posner's brilliant device at argument's end undermines his brilliant attack on the Florida Supreme Court in the argument's middle.  Posner has destroyed a village in order to save it, if it takes a village to apply the law.<br />I ended the book unpersuaded, then, of Posner's major point, but deeply impressed by his critiques of both courts.<br />Moreover, I found that Posner had made the best possible defense of the Supreme Court of the United States.  I had suspected that one could not persuasively defend what Chief Justice Rehnquist and the others had done.  Posner has demonstrated that even one of the most erudite and skilled jurists in the United States cannot save the Court from charges of partisanship, ideology, and lawlessness.<br />Judge Posner has distinguished his reputation even as he has extinguished the reputations of the Florida and U. S. Supreme Courts.	2001-07-17

I agree with reviewers who have said that the prose is typical of Bugliosi's -- overwrought and simplistic are the most polite descriptors -- but I disagree with their dismissal of such prose.  In an age of television and talk radio, the best we should expect from many sources is superficiality, cant, and hype.  As such commentary goes, Bugliosi's is better than Geraldo Rivera's or Rush Limbaugh's or Bill O'Reilly's (to name but three entertainers who masquerade as political commentators).<br />Bugliosi is not a man of the left, so we cannot dismiss his book as another Red Rant.  The author obviously has issues with what he calls the extreme right, so he is not much of a conservative. That does not make Bugliosi a moderate because there is nothing measured about Vincent Bugliosi.<br />That immoderation, overall, is what keeps this book from being very useful.  Bugliosi goes beyond stating that the justices came up with no persuasive opinion and indulged in non-law-like decision-making;  he calls them treasonous criminals.  How does such name-calling improve on the justices' acts of last December? I find such extremism every bit as lamentable as anything Bugliosi attributes to the &quot;felonious five&quot; or to ultra-conservatives.  Indeed, the justices were at least under time pressure.  Did Bugliosi have to produce his NATION article and book so quickly that he had no time for a second draft?  Did neither publisher believe that an editor could improve this screed?<br />If you seek to understand more about &quot;the 36 days&quot; from a legal point of view, read Dershowitz's AND Posner's books.  If instead you want to re-experience the bombast of the media and the partisans over the 36 days, peruse this book.	2001-07-16

I also agree that, having read it, one should move on to later treatments.<br />...Please find it in a library and let it drip off your brain like fine wine down your tongue....	2001-03-09

I enjoyed the humorous nuggets in this book, and it confirmed my suspicion that &quot;Dubya&quot; is in many ways the Christian Right's best form of flattering William Jefferson Clinton through imitation. <br />I have found  more Ivins in earlier books and more humor in Ivins.  She is wickedly funny  on her own; she and her co-author are droll in this book. Perhaps they were  impaired by their having to kid on the square.<br />The question this book  raised for me was whether, by April or May, we shall have two scions and  Clinton wannabes, one Democrat and one Republican, shucking and  triangulating past substance and ideas to the politicking of naked ambition  and content-free communication.  <br />I endorse this book as a means [simple  observation would be another means and cheaper] by which to see just how  empty one of the two major vessels will be.  I await the book that covers  Shrub's opponent, Blood Drop.	2000-03-01

In addition, most of the examples and allusions will strike modern Americans as dated and obscure. Nonetheless, Ellul saw long ago where moderns were headed. He saw that authoritarian use of modern technologies would mesmerize, stultify, and reduce humans to thralls, just as Orwell and Huxley, in far more hysterical prose, had dramatized. <br />Orwell's electronic miracles monitored citizens directly or indirectly. Huxley's miracles were far more therapeutic or medical. But routine surveillance or treatment is inefficient and overwhelms any state that would depend on omniscience or envelopment. Ellul foresaw tools both electronic and human that would so condition subject-audiences that close monitoring and careful prescriptions would be unneeded. <br />Ellul also argued that this \\"Brave, New World\\" could not but subvert democracy and decency. Once the will of the citizen is not his or her own, then democracy in any meaningful sense is at least devalued and perhaps transformed into reassuring internment.<br />Perhaps Ellul's most important insight was that the educated believed themselves immune to propaganda when, due to their proclivity for reading and watching news and other governmental outflow, such \\"intellectuals\\" were actually far more vulnerable than masses who did not receive propaganda as often.<br />So turn off the set and log off the internet and settle in with a truly life-changing read.	1998-09-11
