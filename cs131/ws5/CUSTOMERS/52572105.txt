Maybe its subject was considered too literary and therefore lacking in commercial potential. Whatever.  <br /> <br />It is nevertheless Toibin's best novel to-date and a richly imagined work of fiction that eschews the linear narrative of biography in favour of a selective approach that filters out most of life's noisy irrelevance for a distillate that becomes pure paint for an airbrushed portrait in the hands of author. Exquisitely literate, tasteful and restrained, Toibin's gorgeous prose is typical of a style in the classical tradition now rarely used among contemporary writers of today. <br /> <br />The novel opens on an ominous note as we witness a confidence shattered Henry James recoiling from the blows of poor critical reception accorded to his play (\\"Guy Domville\\") at the West End, London. Compared to the wild success enjoyed by the flamboyant Oscar Wilde, James felt like a failure not realizing his own talent laid elsewhere. From there on, the journey that Toibin takes us on as we follow James' sojourn through the grand parlours of Europe and backwards and forwards in time reaching back to James' childhood past is one that reveals to devastating effect the paralyzing repression endured by the great novelist in his own interior life. James' natural reticience, his lack of courage in facing up to his own nature, condemns him to playing third party spectator as he watches the parade of life march by. Though his heart beats faster in close physical proximity to members of his own sex, he never ever finds true expression of his own sexuality, so to conclude that James was essentially homosexual may be to overstate the truth. His relationships with the opposite sex are either platonic or sexually unenthusiastic, so the conclusion the reader reaches mayyet be the same. Ironically, it is his tragically symbiotic relationship with the emotionally catatonic Constance Fenimore Woolson that is among the poignant and best written in the novel.   <br /> <br />Compared to his brilliant but convention minded older brother William whose worldly achievements never ever surprised, Henry's luminous talent proved the deeper and ultimately shone the brighter. Equally, the relentless torment suffered by his mentally corseted sister Alice and his cousin Minnie Temple only exposed the cruelities of social rigidities and intellectual restrictions imposed on women of the time, a fact doubly reinforced by the oh-so-knowing acts of wickedness and cynicism by the monstrous Lady Wolesley. Quite clearly, the swell in the tide of intellectual freedom hadn't yet reached its fullness, so it's not surprising that Henry James, already seized with self doubt, should find a ready channel for his repressed feelings in the stories and characters he created in his novels. In other words, he lived life only vicariously through the lives of imagined persons who sprung from the pages of his books. But oh what revelations these turned out to be ! It may pay readers already familiar with \\"Portrait Of A Lady\\", \\"Turn Of The Screws\\", \\"Washington Square\\", \\"The Aspern Papers\\", \\"The Wings Of A Dove\\", etc to re-read them for a fuller appreciation of James' inner thoughts and yearnings.   <br /> <br />\\"The Master\\" is a great novel. It is enduring literature of the finest quality and should be read as widely as possible. I can't recommend it highly enough.	2005-09-25

For I don't find any of the Joneses to be charming or endearing enough to excuse their lunatic behaviour or warrant our sympathy for the plight they find themselves in. Janus and his uncle Janus Brian may be gone cases as far as alcoholics and drunks are concerned but the others are just a pathetic lot, lacking in any redeeming qualities, not to mention moral fibre, backbone or integrity, so you can't help but anticipate the disaster that finally befall them. <br /> <br />The father Aldous seems to be in a vague but perpetual state of denial about the state of his family. The mother Colette - an ex-junkie and a recovered alcoholic nave enough to think that a little drink now and again won't hurt - may be a lovely person at heart (she does after all selflessly care for her dead drunk of a brother) but she's an airhead and downright flaky. The daughter Juliette is to my mind just a cold hearted little witch who's way too eager to get her brother thrown out of the family home so that she and her latest beau can shack up and live off her parents. The other siblings aren't bothered about anything or anyone but themselves. Funny how people think it's all right to as awful as they like to living family members, so long as they don't forget to turn up and say a few kind words at their funerals ! Why bother ?  The book works better as a despairing state-of-the-nation commentary on the family as a growingly obsolete institution.    <br /> <br />If Woodward intended any humour in this rather ludicrous and rambling story, you'll find it in the last third, which I must admit did raise a few laughs. Even then, the effect was mild and fleeting and the humour only became a painfulreminder of the absurdity of the Joneses' situation after the humour has dissipated. Sorry, but the sentiment behind Colette's parting gift to Aldous simply rang false. It read like a desperate attempt to make us like the Joneses more.   <br /> <br />Woodward is a promising writer with an engaging style. It's just that the premise he's chosen isn't commensurate with his talent. He should look elsewhere for inspiration.  Not a bad read but unworthy of its Booker nomination.	2005-09-03

Her highly literate style of writing, interest in Greek mythology and art, and her preferred choice of setting for her stories - often girls' schools and institutes of learning - lend a certain aura of female respectability to her mysteries. Those who have read and enjoyed \\"The Lake Of Dead Languages\\" will find \\"The Drowning Tree\\" equally entertaining if not as satisfying. <br /> <br />Goodman takes her time telling her story of love, friendship, betrayal, heritage and madness. The plot enfolds amidst much evocative delving into the past where deadly secrets are buried in recently discovered sketches, letters, deliberately misassembled stained glass paintings, submerged treasures in out-of-bounds estate grounds, etc. All this paves the way for a denouement that isn't as much predictable as artificial, as if Goodman is trying her damnest to avoid the obvious once readers have cottoned onto the truth very early on about what really happened more than a hundred years ago. For this reason, I found the ending somewhat anti-climactic, like a last minute diversion into some minor lane. It is ultimately the consistently high quality of writing that rescues the \\"The Drowning Tree\\" from being an averagely plotted thriller. Goodman should find new plot direction if she is to avoid repetition and being stuck in a rut. <br /> <br />Four stars for the plot but five stars overall.	2005-08-02

Perhaps it should have gone on to win the prize `cos it really is kind of special. A narrative with minimal dialogue about the life of tattoo artistes and their strange, subterranean low life trade, it is specifically about one Cyril Parks, who through his blood-streaked sweat-tainted craft, helps to restore the damaged parts of individuals (no, not freaks) who are often victims of some act of human deprivation or violence. For the first time, light is cast upon the murky practice of tattoo artistes and the psyche of their clients and it is entirely to Hall's credit that she has successfully woven together different elements of human interest to tell a story that is at once intriguing, poignant and redeeming. The love story - if it can be described as such - between Cy and Grace isn't what you'd expect. In Grace, all the hurts of living come together, so the twist at the end should come as no surprise.    Without a doubt, Hall spares us little about the seediness of the business but it's her excellent characterization that makes EM such an absorbing read. Cy's mentor, the drunk and dissolute Eliot Riley, a complex Fagin type character, is like a spirit haunting our protagonist long after he's been written out of the plot. Reeda, Cy's mother, another fascinating character, is described by Hall as \\"graceless\\", yet exudes nothing if not grace in the way she calmly accepts all kinds of curved balls life throws at her. Pity Hall never resolved to any degree of clarity Reeda's past relationship with Riley. Finally, there's Grace, a Jewish immigrant treading the boardwalks of Coney Island as a circus girl,  and a revelation. Silent and mysterious, she's the hardened survivor who hasn't lost her vulnerability or surrendered her soul and is the embodiment of the spirit of Reeda and Riley.     \\"The Electric Michelangelo\\" is quite simply gorgeously written, a thing of beauty. Hall's lyricism is illuminating, never showy. Read pages 260 and 261 of the English paperback edition and you have all the insight you'll ever need into the cult mentality of those who seek the permanence of tattoos on their bodies. Quite brilliant.	2005-07-23

The ordinary Brit-in-the-street in 1948 didn't know who these coloured people were, where they came from, what they were doing in their country, nor were they much interested to know that they had fought loyally on the side of Allies during the war, and so were deserving of being treated with some respect if nothing else. The comedy of errors is complete when juxtaposed against the equally mistaken impression held by the people of the colonies that \\"Mother Land\\" was the land of milk and honey offering a far superior way of life to the ones they were leading in their own countries. Those that made it to England came face to face with a nasty shock.   <br /> <br />Levy has chosen a heavy subject but she tells her story with so much lightness, humour and charm the reader can't help but be seduced by its easy profundity. Her four main characters whose first person voices shape the narrative are fully rounded, totally believable human beings. They aren't always sympathetic - Bernard is an ignoramus but nothing worse - he hasn't got a bad heart. Queenie is delightful in her generous spiritedness, her artlessness and her infectious sense of humour. The manner in which Gilbert and Hortense learn about the way things are is simply heartbreaking and thankfully, to Levy's credit, without the usual overflow of drama and tears. Hortense's transformation from little miss hoity-toity to mature wife and mother closes the drama on a note that hints at a bridge across the racial divide. This is no cop-out, only an expression of hopefulness for the future.   <br /> <br />Andrea Levy, a young British novelist born to Jamaican parents, has an easy un-showy and instinctive style to her prose that is truly delightful. Far better than say Monica Ali whose \\"Brick Lane\\" must be one of the most highly overrated contemporary novels of recent years. Readers who enjoy good writing without the pyrotechnics will love \\"Small Island\\". Highly recommended.	2005-06-25
US	52572105	R2T5KRRMW7NFW6	006072448X	467980841	We Need to Talk About Kevin: A Novel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Harrowing but brilliant read, worthy of the Orange Prize	All too rarely is a book prize winner worthy of the prestige the award bestows upon it. If that's what you're thinking, believe me, you won't be feeling the same way about the new Orange Prize winner after you've read it. Lionel Shriver's \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is truly rivetting, a totally engrossing read and an outstanding novel that handles its difficult subject with such a searing degree of honesty and with such a clarity of vision and perception you don't have to be a mother to realise that ultimately parenting isn't a science, not even an art and that the influence one has in the shaping of the personality of one's offspring isn't as dominant a factor as one would like to think. Narrated through a series of unanswered letters to her estranged husband, Franklin, in the aftermath of their son Kevin's slaughter-fest, Eva leaves no stone unturned as she unearths and examines every bit of detail of her relationship with Kevin from the time of his birth to the present in order to understand her own failings as a mother, her own culpability. Funny, isn't it, how all mothers think they are the baker and their children their bread ? That Shriver should allow Eva to draw a blank after her exhaustive and harrowing introspection isn't surprising or cheating for having let off Eva lightly. It's only telling it like it is. Only Eva knows deep down inside she cannot take responsibility for the way Kevin turned out. Look at how he repaid his father's sensitive nurturing. Kevin's the changeling child from hell, the devil incarnate from \\"The Omen\\" but that's Eva's secret her naive husband refuses to share in.     Kevin may be the devil incarnate but what drove him to the rampage ? Now here's rub. Kevin understood the society that spawned him. He knew where and how he could get his two minutes of fame and watch his mother turn overnight into a second liner celebrity icon (after him, of course) and being skewered for his crime and \\"bringing him up wrong\\". That, for Kevin,would be like scoring a double victory, having his cake and eating it. Shriver's indictment of American society, one that has come to take everything that's good and right for granted when they remain hopelessly out of reach for many people elsewhere in the world, and one that expresses uncomprehending outrage when it's snatched away (albeit momentarily) from them, is a timely caution against complacency and self satisfaction. In other words, you don't want to end up like Franklin in the story.    \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" digs real deep and hits a couple of painful spots if you're a parent. Though emotionally harrowing, the close and clammy truths the novel reveals and Shriver's razor sharp no holds barred prose makes it an utterly rewarding and resonant read. One of the very best this year. A brilliant novel you shouldn't miss !	2005-06-18
US	52572105	R24A45TKHS5FX3	0099466090	958755338	Snowleg	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Identity and redemption behind the Berlin Wall	Nicholas Shakespeare's \\"Snowleg\\" is a novel about the search for identity and redemption. Its hero Peter Hithersay's young life first comes to a sudden standstill when his mother stuns him with a confession that just about erases his past and leaves his self identity shaken and confused. No sooner has he set out on an obsessive mission to recover his past than he meets and fall in love with a young East German girl who desperately needs his help to escape the East and whom he knows only as Snowleg.  In a familiar moment of weakness, he rejects her and spends the rest of his life regretting and trying to atone for this one mistake. Whose forgiveness he needs - hers or his own  - is a moot point and a theme of the novel.     For sure, life for Peter loses all semblence of normality until his soul is settled. Till then, he sleepwalks through life as in a state of suspended animation. He conveniently forgets he has a loving family back home in England. As a medical student in Germany, he wanders through a series of half-hearted affairs with some of the most selfish and unsavoury women you can possibly imagine and even manages to sire a son. Only when he connects with an old lady he is treating does he unknowingly stumble upon the first clue that will lead him to one of two people he is searching for...and then not.  Find out for yourself. Shakespeare's reliance on chance and coincidence to make this plot connection is possibly a weakness but one we all too readily forgive for the romantic resonance it brings to Peter's story.    Those who have read \\"Stasiland\\", Anna Funder's wonderful piece of investigative journalism, will also appreciate the heightened sense of drama brought upon by the post-1989 confession of those who had spied for the regime and lived through a chapter of recent history from behind the Walls. The cataclysm visited upon the lives of East Germans since the Wall came down couldn't be more contrasting against the relative stability of England.    The parallel between Peter's story and that of his mother's says something about the cyclicity and the folly of love and life. She has learnt to let go. He must do too. One's self identity can only be redeemed from within, the novelist seems to be saying.     \\"Snowleg\\" is a beautifully written novel. Definitely one to be read and savoured. Recommended.	2005-05-22

The \\"bitter fruit\\" imagery is resonant of the poison that infects their relationship with each other and members of their extended family and friends.     Lydia's bitterness at Silas' cowardly complicity turns into anger and despair that only a clean break can dispel. More tragic still for Mikey, himself the \\"bitter fruit\\" of his mother's rape by a white security official, who is deprived of any means of confronting the open secret of his own paternity until he finds the perfect outlet for a practice revenge before the inevitable happens. Our sense of  Mikey's psychological state crystallizes the moment we discover that he covets signed originals of published classics stolen from his teacher's home. His identity crisis, coupled with his search for his family's roots and his own biological identity parallels that of South Africa's confused present as the country struggles to emerge from the trauma of its apartheid past. Incest, a recurring theme in the novel, is also symbolic on two levels, of the perverted self-hatred that resides and festers from bleeding wounds in the human heart as well as of the social disequilibrium that persists in a nation in transition.    Dangor's eloquence is both precise and poetic. His style achieves a nicely judged balance, allowing him the facility to explore the interiors of the human heart without sacrificing the demands of  tempo and momentum in a gathering plot. The shattering climax isn't as much shocking as in the way it is so economically and unsensationally told.     \\"Bitter Fruit\\" is an excellent novel and fully deserving of the lavish critical praise heaped upon it. Highly recommended.	2005-04-03

Maybe because I've just started taking a serious interest in Chinese history. Apart from it being a heart wrenchingly written yet curiously dry-eyed and emotionally direct account of Chang's three generation family history stretching back to the warlord years of the 1920s, there's no better or more pleasurable way of learning about China's tumultous Mao years than from reading \\"Wild Swans\\". What you glean from the history books is corroborated and richly fleshed out by Chang in her detailed first hand revelation of the suffering and torment endured by her parents during the Cultural Revolution years when the country went totally berserk.     Chang's story is particularly memorable for the way it reveals the acute and palpably real sense of anticipation in the psyche of educated people like her parents during the onset of the post-1949 Communist years. Her father's unquestioning obedience to the dictum of China's socialist ideals at great personal cost to himself may raise a few unintended laughs among readers today, but that's how much people like him were willing to sacrifice for a better life for his countrymen. Her mother was a saint, considering how she had to uphold yet be content playing second or third fiddle to her husband's unwavering fervour for the communist cause. The outcome or pay off is tragic.    Read this if you're not a history student but want to understand China in the 20th Century. \\"Wild Swans\\" is a modern classic and a stupendous piece of work.

Tellingly, Choi adopts the perspective of the shadowy helper Jenny -  daughter of an interned Japanese immigrant - rather than the celebrity figure of Pauline (Patty) in this fictional and richly imagined account of the incident.    Choi's examination of 70s radicalism and racism in America throws up fascinating insights into the phenomenon of terrorism as we follow Jenny's increasingly uncertain mental and emotional state while hiding and keeping Pauline and her kidnappers away from the clutches of the law. Her prolonged period of exposure and contact with the kidnappers lead her to examine and understand her own motives for taking part in a bombing of a public property, her feelings for William, a co-conspirator now in jail, and the caustic irony of terrorist acts which devalue human lives while claiming it as their cause. Jenny gets to consider the twisted logic by which a terrorist absolves himself from guilt by calculating that the building about to go up in smoke shouldn't have any occupants anyway. Tough, if there should be.      Jenny thinks she knows Pauline from the time they're out there playing Thelma and Louise. Little does she know that when the game is up and Pauline is back in the arms of her clan, the realm of protection that privilege and celebrity confers takes over and their time together seems like only a dream. The message isn't a pretty one. But it would be wrong to see Pauline as dishonest. She isn't. Her helplessness in captivity gives her the freedom to hit out at her family and the high society that made her unhappy and a rebel. In other words, she got a free ride from not having to take responsibility for her action but eventually the privileged close ranks and a packaged verdict is delivered to a bewildered public.    Susan Choi is an important new writer in contemporary fiction. Her voice rings loud and clear over the familiar and much publicized story of Patty Hearst. \\"American Woman\\" was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize. Pity she didn't win it `cos it's an astounding sophomore effort from Choi and for my money better than the one that did.	2005-03-20

Shirley Hazzard's \\"The Great Fire\\" was a worthy winner but it's also more difficult and less accessible to the reading public.  <br /> <br />EOTU is an uncommon masterpiece, a magically uplifting work of American fiction that outstrips anything I have read in recent years. Written in gloriously poetic, incandescent prose, EOTU is ambitious, even epic in scope, yet relentlessly intimate in execution. Wiggins somehow manages to locate the fulcrum that keeps the delicate balance throughout without losing either thread. The story of Fos and Opal is a tender love story on one level and a ode to the mystery of life on another.  <br /> <br />Fos is obsessed with light, radiance, phosphorous material, anything that glows in the dark. Opal is the \\"gem\\" that drops into his life while on the way to catch the falling stars one night. But unlike the untutored Opal who exudes a quiet wisdom in dealing with life's surprises, Fos hangs his life on harnessing the natural world for the betterment of mankind, so when his faith in science turns around unexpectedly to backbite the hand that feeds it, his world crumbles and dissolves. But just when it seems like science has dealt the couple its most cruel blow, we are reminded that life has also gifted them with Lightfoot, a child that dropped into their lives, as it were, from nowhere. Just as it is capable of delivering Lightfoot to the childless couple, life is equally capable of letting an innocent child bite into a live cable and leave death and destruction in its wake.   <br /> <br />When Lightfoot picks up the fallen threads of his life with Flash's help and he meets a girl called Ramona who paints using the invisible glow of fish hearts to illuminate her picture, we know that the cycle of life has once again begun and that it will go on forever. <br /> <br />\\"Evidence Of Things Unseen\\" isamong the finest of contemporary American literature that deserves to be widely read.

Well, \\"Who's Sorry Now (WSN)\\" made the longlist a couple of years ago but inexplicably got no further. That's a real shame because WSN should have been that breakout novel. It's hilarious and an out and out winner in the best English tradition of comic writing. Crisply written, hugely funny, razor sharp in its humour, deadly in its comic timing, yet terribly sad in its observation of the state of contemporary life in England.  <br /> <br />Those with an inherently biased view that comic writing has to be lightweight and frivolous should read WSN and then reconsider. Such is the deceptive modesty and slyness of Jacobson's aim that before each laughter dies on your lips - usually after another of Marvin's or Charlie's pathetic antics - you begin to discern the taste of bile in your mouth. The Kreitmans and Merriweathers are or think they're good friends until the men agree on a spouse swapping experiment to cure one of them of boredom born of envy and fidelity. The contrasting lifestyles and social milieu of the couples soon find the experiment taking them to places they never imagined. Happiness and bliss from their new coupling soon dissipates, and here's when the plot takes a surprising turn. Jacobson's deftness and sureness of touch shines through in the spying sequence that ends on a deliciously jaw dropping note ! The novel winds down dispensing a general sense of poetic justice, though not everyone comes off safely. Some emerge with more than a scratch. The title's message is reserved deservedly for Marvin.  <br /> <br />WSN isn't all about sex and infidelity. The relevance of the family as a social unit, class-based lifestyles and cultural snobbery all come under Jacobson's cleared-eyed scrutiny. Naturally, the verdict isn't encouraging.  <br /> <br />WSN isn't funny ha-ha. It's a comic novel with a deep social conscience and that's a rarity.	2005-01-21

He understands the social rules of the times only too well, ie, that in order to survive, someone like him needs to keep his head down and avoid trouble at all cost. But trouble has a way of following him around, first when he faces off a nasty situation with his boss who steals money left by a client for the widow of a fellow caddie who dies on duty, then when he finds himself in a mysteriously unresolved confrontation with his would-be stepfather one night, and finally when Packard Miller adopts him as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; on the golfing circuit, things start to spiral out of control.<br /><br />When Packard Miller, the enigmatic and emotionally challenged police sergeant, gets involved with Norah Rose, a rape victim and sole survivor of a yacht hijacking and then marries her, the murder-cum-rape investigation takes a queasy turn, surely a commentary on the irrelevance of reasoning in the face of retaliation against racism. Miller, as it turns out, discovers too late that he cannot hide from himself, so even as he pulls poor scarred Norah into the future with her back to the past, his own unresolved nature resurfaces to haunt him with shocking and horrific results.<br /><br />Dexter's narrative technique is nothing short of brilliant. His storytelling is also as evocative and atmospheric as you'd expect a noir-ish thriller to be. Even his minor characters, like susan - yes, Susan with a small s - the mincing tease and young photographer wife of failed property developer Mr Cooper, is a revelation. The passage describing the \\"explosive\\" effect she had on young Train gives new meaning to eroticism in prose.  There can't also be a more powerful indictment of racism than in Plural's decline from hiring out his head and suffering permanent brain damage from it.<br /><br />If  I'm allowed two small criticisms, I'd say that Packard's character is underwritten and in need of further elaboration. The last few chapters also seem to lack momentum, so when the big payoff arrives, it misses - by a small margin - the sweet spot as the story grinds to a halt.<br /><br />That said, \\"Train\\" is a dazzling triumph and one of the best novels I have read all year.led property developer Mr Cooper, is a revelation.

US	52572105	RU59DECOZ42MV	0375701494	160007841	Old School	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Truth and redemption - a modern classic	It seems to me that good old fashioned writing has gone out of favour while crazy novels that read like the drug induced hallucination of some raving lunatic are shoo-ins for book critics' lists these days. So, it is with genuine relief that I found Tobias Wolff's truly excellent \\"Old School\\" on the shortlists for the National Book Critics Circle and the Pen/Faulkner Awards this year. Finally, due recognition is given to a conventionally structured but beautifully written novel that comes as a timely reminder that literary excellence isn't about technical pyrotechnics but coherence, integrity and literacy. Truth, courage and integrity are themes that reverberate throughout Wolff's small but emotionally potent novel.   <br /> <br />The study of literature is important because it illuminates and holds the mirror to one's soul. This perspective was never more evident than in a 50s New England prep school where only the best minds qualified and competed for the school's most prestigious annual prize each year which included a personal interview with some loftily regarded visiting icon from the literary world. But when the pursuit of enlightenment through an appreciation of truth, art and beauty is cloaked in so much elitism, it comes as no surprise that the subtly corruptive influence of class and privilege or more pointedly the lack thereof can lead - ironically - to the opposite. In the case of Wolff's unnamed narrator, his less than correct social pedigree becomes a secret that finally explodes to ruin his chances of winning a personal interview with the heralded Ernest Hemmingway. As he dons a self-forgetful mask to find acceptance by his peers, his essays become an exercise in emulation - his poems speak of \\"elks\\" rather than deers - he strays further and further from his inner self until the eve of the deadline for the submission of his entry, when desperate for inspiration, he stumbles upon a story published by a student in a girl's school magazine.....   <br /><br />The narrator's crime against his school saved him from a lie. He shows no outward sign of guilt or remorse because in his own eyes, he has done no wrong. The story WAS his very own. In truth, he found redemption and just in time. Much later in life, long after the event, he discovers that Dean Makepeace, the school dean who suddenly quit his position at the time the world tumbled about him, did so for much the same reason, to keep his integrity intact.  <br /> <br />The study of literature may have lost much of its shine and prestige today. Yet its value - like the gold standard - remains. \\"Old School\\" is highly relevant and instructive in our age and is already a modern classic. A real gem of a novel.	2004-12-19

The author weaves together horrific stories from behind the Berlin War about lives lived under the prying eyes of the East German secret police and its appalling private network of recruits, the shocking tactics employed by the state apparatus to invent a false reality for their citizens' forced consumption and the ludicrous extent they go to intimidate and cow dissenters into submission.     The horror of Funder's findings through interviews with survivors of this system is sharply heightened by self deluded confessionals extracted from the former regime's stoutest and craziest defenders after the wall had crumbled. Without a doubt, the \\"thought police\\" has come to believe the lies they had invented and fed their victims with. The free world may have celebrated with the German people when the Berlin Wall came crashing down....but has anyone considered the psychological trauma ordinary easterners must have experienced when overnight they had to cope with a new reality thrust upon them. It must have been like getting Martians to live as Earthlings !      Funder's work is a powerful, timely and acute reminder to the world that after East Germany, there is another story waiting to be told. It's called \\"Tales from the Hermit Kingdom\\". No doubt, more horror stories in store. So for those who optimistically proclaim the death of history, hold on to your horses, there's still a loose one about !	2004-12-05

To condense over 2000 years of Japanese history into 300 pages is no easy feat. So Meyer's \\"Japan : A Concise History\\" is an excellent introduction to the topic for any newcomer or reader interested in a quick overview of the essential elements of the subject. I found the chronological segmentation of the different phases of Japanese history especially useful. Serious students of Japanese history may justifiably prefer a topic by topic approach but for first timers, chronology is a relief and an ideal prism through which to peer into the past.<br /><br />Format aside, the writing is a little dry, which makes the book less than an absorbing read. The absence of any maps, pictures and graphical representation is unforgiveable - a thoughtless omission on the part of the author and the publishers. We know how the use of maps and pictures can make all the difference. They enliven and add immeasurably to the enjoyment of the reading.<br /><br />A good book which could easily have been better.	2004-12-05

While critics have been nearly unanimous in their praise for Ford's breakthrough novel, readers have been more divided about its merits. Some allege its lack of plot, others complain about the seemingly interminable stream of consciousness styled interior monologue of its central character. But what makes failed novelist turned sportswriter Frank Boscombe such an enduring figure in American literature may be his more than passing resemblence to Willy Loman and his litany of everydayman insecurities. Surely, the dank whiff of failure about Frank's middle aged crisis struck existence is a condition that most educated American males can relate to.<br /><br />Bereaved of a child and divorced from a wife (referred to only as X) whom he still vaguely regards as part of his environment, Frank finds himself drifting into a permanent state of \\"dreaminess\\", which when he explains himself turns out to be a place we've all been before though few would care to admit it. X and sportsmen in general, he calls factualists. Their lives are purposeful, defined, nailed down by very specific goals. Sportswriting allows Frank to abdicate from making any real decisions because his duty is only to report.  Should it surprise that Frank scores a big zero on the relationship front ?  Dreaminess isn't conducive to the making of any real friendships. With women, there's at least sex, though his fling with Vicky proves to be another rudderless affair. With men, there's even less incentive to fake interest. When fellow divorced men's club member Walter confesses his dark secret, Frank doesn't want to know, so when Walter finally chucks it in, Frank's response is one of incomprehension.<br /><br />The quality of Ford's writing is consistently excellent and never less than satisfying. Literate, sensitive and honest, he manages even to win sympathy for a hero whom many less charitable may regard as a wimp. For all Frank's faults, we root for him because we recognise something of us in him. The novel ends on a hopeful note which leaves a smile on our face. \\"The Sportswriter\\" is a wonderful novel.a hero whom many less charitable may regard as a wimp.

The problem doesn't lie with the story but with Winton's language which others may find poetic and lyrical, but just seems jarring and obscure to me. His characters spit out half sentences, phrases, punctuated by local slang and references that nobody unfamiliar with the Australian outback will be able to understand.<br /><br />Notwithstanding, \\"Dirt Music\\" has a decent story going about two people, one unhappy and listless in a loveless marriage, the other strung out and catatonic with grief after a car accident which wipes out his entire family, how they ignited the last spark of life in each other when their paths crossed one day, with devastating consequences. Damaged people recognise and are drawn like magnets to each other, Winton seems to be saying.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Georgie and Lu share very little page space. Whereas Georgie's past and character is revealed in words, Winton relies on language and imagery to express Lu's situation, which lies buried beneath his deep freeze reserve. Lu's solitary flight into the wilderness may be key to the story but it goes on for far too long and becomes interminable. The Georgie chapters are far more satisfying.<br /><br />Not as good as \\"The Riders\\". Disappointing.	2004-11-11

Without the benefit of hindsight and a false 20/20 vision that an omniscient narrator would have provided, Logan's words are vibrant with currency and charged with a spontaneity and immediacy that guarantees honesty and integrity. As we follow him through his school years, his brush with the Bloomsbury set in England, his experiences during the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War, his mix up in wartime espionage, leading to his sad personal decline and descent into abject poverty as the century draws to a close, we are left with the distinct impression that Logan's lifetime highs and lows are seldom of his own choosing and the insight that it isn't what life delivers but how we deal with its challenges that finally matter.  <br /> <br />The novel is also brimful with thrilling episodes - far too many to enumerate - as Logan's career  undergoes a series of dramatic transformation - though his scary encounter with the sinister Duke and Duchess of Windsor is easily the most memorable.  <br /> <br />Boyd's ultimate coup de grace may lie in his storytelling technique, which reveals an uncommon deftness in keeping Logan always deeply human and ordinary, thus enabling him to tell a story of an extraordinary life and making it utterly believable.  <br /> <br />Boyd's prose is sharp, poised, humorous and intelligent. \\"Any Human Heart\\" is hence a wondrously literate yet emotionally generous piece of work that glows with resonance recalling greatliterary giants like Evelyn Waugh. Few fictional writers today manage to find and convey that delicate balance. Boyd has done it. \\"Any Human Heart\\" is enduring contemporary literature of the finest quality that deserves to be read and enjoyed by all. Highly recommended.	2004-11-06
US	52572105	R79OOIDSV1FYV	1400041090	582474494	A Distant Shore	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Alienation and displacement in contemporary England	\\"A Distant Shore (ADS)\\" is Caryl Phillips' beautifully mature and emotionally resonant new novel about life in contemporary England. The story's protagonists, Dorothy and Soloman, can't come from more different backgrounds. She's white, he's black. She's a lonely retired schoolteacher with deep family secrets, including a broken marriage, to haunt her. He's the sole survivor of a family wiped out by ethnic cleansing in an unnamed African country and an illegal immigrant desperate to begin a new life in civilised and democratic England.  They are both \\"outsiders\\" in their own social context and outsiders recognise if not seek each other out in their subconscious yearning for human contact. Their dim lives brighten up albeit briefly when they intersect before fate rudely steps in to despatch them to their own black holes. Significantly, even their shared loneliness could not bridge the gap in their ethnic and social differences when they tried to connect but sadly failed. Unbeknown to them, they would never get a second chance.  <br /> <br />Phillips tells his story backwards with time scale detours in between. The final outcome comes as a shock when it is revealed less than a quarter of our way through. We then backtrack into the past when Soloman was Gabriel and we follow his escape route out of hell into the land of milk and honey. Dorothy, who disappears for much of the middle section, returns in the final third to reveal her own private hell from being repeatedly used and humiliated by men, including a male colleague and an immigrant grocer, who aren't interested in anything but a casual sexual relationship. Her fragile mental state takes a turn for the worse after she arrives a little too late to nurse her estranged and dying lesbian sister and goes into terminal decline when her friendship with Soloman is cruelly ended.  <br />        <br />Phillips' narrative technique parallels the novel's theme of alienation and displacement. The early Dorothy sequence suggests she's an unreliable narrator before we finally realise she's indeed in mental decline. The quick cuts as we leap backwards and forwards in time is fused together expertly and seamlessly, so we don't find it confusing.   <br /> <br />Blighted by racism and parochialism, Phillips's contemporary England isn't a pretty sight. You may not die from ethnic cleansing in England but all the same, it's a society fraying at the edges from the pressures of new social forces at work. Yet the deep, deep sadness at the heart of ADS is tempered by the realisation that in life, there's always kindness and goodness to be found in the most casual or unlikely of places and persons (eg,  Soloman's sponsors from the north have absolute hearts of gold). <br /> <br />\\"A Distant Shore\\" is an excellent novel that will appeal to readers who love books that speak of deep and personal truths. Those who enjoyed Clare Morrall's \\"Astonishing Splashes Of Colours\\", one of last year's Booker Prize nominees, will also love \\"A Distant Shore\\".	2004-09-18

With GD, those acquainted with the works of South African novelists like Nadine Gordimer and J M Coetzee will find themselves in familiar territory. South Africa in transition is a perspective commonly adopted by these writers.  <br /> <br />At its highest level, the brooding tension between Frank and Laurence in their unlikely relationship is symbolic of the struggle for supremacy between the forces of old and new. When Laurence's wide-eyed enthusiasm is pitted against Frank's resigned and cynical indifference, the result is cataclysmic, far beyond the reader's imagination. While Galgut's story is touched by death and regret, his vision isn't entirely bleak. When Laurence and Frank swap beds, deadbeat after a long night out, they feel strangely comfortable in each other's beds. Like yin and yang, are they not twin halves of a pupa society emerging from its chrysalis ? Laurence's stubborn perseverance against the stultifying bureaucracy of Dr Ngema's hospital isn't always altruistic. His callous disregard for Frank's plight as he goes in frenzied pursuit of his vision of setting up a village clinic is delirious if not a little mad. In spite of this, it is Laurence who unleashes the momentum that forces Frank to examine what's wrong in his thwarted life - his failed relationships with his father, his ex-wife, Maria, etc, and who is ultimately the catalyst for Frank's transformation.  <br /> <br />There are scenes in GD that are truly memorable, like Frank's and Zanele's unexpected nocturnal encounter with the shadowy figure of the Brigadier, the town's former tinpot dictator. Surely Zanele's schoolgirl-like enchantment with her host is Galgut's sideswipe at the veneer thin and uncomprehending sloganeering of armed chaired liberals from afar. Galgut's characterisation is excellent, sharp and realised throughout. The sullenness of Tehogo, the hospital's sole unqualified male nurse, perfectly encapsulates the corruption, rot and decay of South African society. Only the rehearsed platitudes flowing from the mouth of Dr Ngema comes across as false, stagy and predictable. You know what she will say even before she says it. A minor lapse in otherwise great characterisation. <br /> <br />Galgut's poised, unhurried and reasoned prose is an absolute delight. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to reveal many layered truths of a society at its crossroads without hyperbole or false bravura. A thoroughly confident and assured debut from Galgut, who will no doubt join the ranks of great South African novelists.	2004-09-06

Perhaps that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed it while many others disliked it. As a standalone novel about narcissism - surely a contemporary social ill, if not the scourge of our age - I thought \\"Dorian\\" stood its own ground very well.  <br /> <br />Self doesn't pull his punches in his depiction of the dissolute lifestyle of the upper classes. He seethes with barely concealed contempt for their amorality and their never-ending drug and sex orgies. There's not one sympathetic character among the lot. They're careless and callous of life - they dismiss somebody else's death by murder with the wave of a limp wrist - so when they catch AIDS and find the dagger pointing at their own throats, should anybody baulk ? Dorian is only the distillate and the end result of a values system that encourages if not promotes self worship.  <br /> <br />Self's excessive wordplay - headache inducing as always - is only quintessentially Self. I'm sure he's added liberally to the English language. His graphic, no holds barred take on decadence is often unpleasant and shocking. His narrative technique is sometimes confusing as he takes us backwards and forwards in time, juxtaposing past events alongside current occurrences through the use of bedside confessions. We confront our horror just as the tale reaches its nadir when Dorian confuses himself with his airbrushed video images. The rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br />\\"Dorian\\" isn't for everyone. It's nasty, graphic and violent but also eerily contemporary and necessary.	2004-08-14
US	52572105	RCI440I32P9NO	0060557540	5482241	The Known World	Books	5	8	12	N	N	An epic novel about Slavery and moral confusion	Edward P. Jones' \\"The Known World (KW)\\", the 2003 Pulitzer Prize winner, is an epic novel about slavery in the years immediately preceding the American Civil War. Unlike other epic novels set in the same era like \\"Cold Mountain\\", KW doesn't have a real protagonist because Jones' interest extends beyond telling a story about individual lives. His subject is Slavery and in choosing to examine a curious and little known phenomenon of free blacks owning un-free blacks, he sets up the perfect vehicle for exploring the corrupting influence of this pernicious social paradigm on the morals of otherwise decent human beings.  <br /> <br />Henry Townsend, the novel's nominal hero whose early and untimely death is anticipated in its first pages, thinks he can be a more humane slave owner once he buys his own freedom and becomes a slave owner himself. He doesn't live long enough to see his \\"property\\" fall apart and dissipate under the hapless management of his widow Caldonia. Using the detached voice of an omniscient narrator, Jones weaves together an intricate tapestry of interconnected anecdotes involving a huge cast of characters - too many to keep track of - to reveal the horrors of slavery and the moral confusion it brings to its subjects. His characters, black and white, struggle unsuccessfully to give expression to their humanity because the legal dictates of slavery and the code of behaviour it enforces on its subjects are unnatural and run counter to their instincts. This sense of moral confusion is clearly evident in the choices facing Fern Elston and the Sheriff, but most poignantly conveyed in the tentative coupling of Caldonia and her overseer Moses, whose affair is doomed not to survive their legal relationship of owner and owned when the chips are down. <br /> <br />Jones' narrative voice is calm and controlled throughout, accentuating by way of ironical inference the abnormality of human relationships under slavery . His anecdotes are moving and heartfelt thoughnot always memorable - there are a couple we could do without, like the one detailing Counsel's long sojourn across the country, - though his tendency for under-dramatisation only serves to heighten the impact of those that resonate. There is none more tender than the story of Elias and Celeste, nor one more  heartbreaking than that of August who bought his freedom only to be sold back to slavery when his papers disappear down the throat of a white rogue patroller. The novel ends on an uplifting note offering hope and a future to the lucky few who escaped the system. <br /> <br />\\"The Known World\\" is classic American literature, a novel that will be read by many for years to come.	2004-08-07

This time, she bagged the 2003 National Book Award for fiction with &quot;The Great Fire (GF)&quot;. While critical reviews have been ecstatic, the reading public appears to be polarised between those who adore it and those who loathe it.  Me, I love it because it's right up my alley - ethereal and cerebral, yet curiously gothic. The experience is akin to one gained from staring at a great painting and imagining the lives of its subject on canvass. Turner's impressionist painting on the cover of the British paperback version is particularly resonant.  Readers who draw on the immediacy of emotions for their enjoyment of a novel may find the effect of Hazzard's writing style distancing, bloodless, sometimes even unreal. <br />Hazzard's descriptive prose is spare, picturesque and precise, each word crystallising on the printed page like a hand picked gem.  Her dialogue is terse, sometimes awkward. Nobody speaks like that, you catch yourself thinking, before you realise that maybe Hazzard never intended to capture the flow and cadence of natural speech anyway. Each word is laden with so much meaning there's almost a history behind it.  GF is a challenging read but the riches within make the effort worthwhile.<br />The post-2WW landscape in Asia as described by Hazzard is one of utter desolation, filled with ashes from the ruins of torn lives. The burden of victory oppresses the survivors as much as death and humiliation haunts the conquered. There are no winners. Aldred and Peter, the novel's two protaganists find themselves awash and adrift, emotionally disconnected and unable to resume with any conviction the lives they left behind. Fate, as it pans out, is kinder to Aldred than to Peter. He finds courage in reaching out for an innocent love and is finally redeemed by it. Peter is jolted by a squalid encounter with sickness and disease but his act of compassion signalling an unconscious desire to rejoin the living only brings devastating consequences. <br />The novel's thematic coherence and rich tapestry of colours is reflected in its wondrous characterisation. Some, like the elder Driscolls - frightening in their ugliness, or the prophetic &quot;Ginger&quot; (Japanese POW), may not occupy much page space but they remain firmly etched in our minds long after they have disappeared from the foreground. They and the many others who make fleeting but memorable appearances are the glue that bind the story together.<br />&quot;The Great Fire&quot; is like a finely chiselled work of art whose appeal may be limited to readers of serious literature. Clearly too, Shirley Hazzard won't be everybody's cup of tea, though readers who're so inclined will find GF an intoxicating read. A gorgeous novel.	2004-07-18

After all, who ever heard of DBC Pierre ? Nobody till then, I reckoned. So, what's the hoopla about ?<br />With VGL, Pierre has decisively broken the mould of how a book winner should read. It's a sizzling satire about reality TV obsessed America and zanily written in helter-skelter youth culture slang language, liberally laced with broken English and references nobody outside of Texas will understand. I wasn't convinced the critics had got it right until I was two-thirds way through. Then I was blown away.<br />Sure, the people of Martirio are gross. They're overweight, gadget fixated, fame obsessed and mostly in dire need of getting a life. Some American readers may feel justifiably offended by Pierre's caricature of contemporary America but if the flood of reality TV programmes inundating the media is an indication of where the nation's pulse is at, I say we have every reason to be worried. Pierre's satire is an indictment of the media, whose &quot;dumbing down policy&quot; towards its public fosters a &quot;anything for two minutes of fame&quot; mentality even if it's in total disregard of the truth. In fact, nobody in Martirio seems much interested in the truth - particularly if it's complex - unless it's capable of being packaged into something simple, something the public will be able to embrace and throw their collective weight behind . So, Pierre rightly asks very early in the novel whether something that happened actually happened if it wasn't seen by anyone. <br />When Vernon's buddy Jesus goes berserk, shoots down his college mates and then turns the gun on himself, somebody other than the dead Jesus must pay. There's only one convenient scapegoat and that's poor Vernon. Nobody's interested in his DNA proof alibi - a hilarious touch  - which leaves psycho reporter Ledesma an open field to frame him. <br />Pierre speaks to us through Vernon. Only in Vernon's late encounterwith a surprising fellow inmate headed for the gallows do we hear Pierre's own voice. He exhorts Vernon to join the others and play the game if he's to have any chance at all, the message being &quot;don't wait for God above to intervene&quot;. Be God yourself, hence Vernon &quot;God&quot; Little.  I'm not sure I agree but Pierre sure makes a compelling point.<br />&quot;Vernon God Little&quot; isn't going to everybody's cup of tea. For a start, it won't be easy reading for non-Western readers like me. The youth culture slang was real heavy going. You are advised to read it slowly to get it. Quite apart from my mild irritation with Pierre's headache inducing language, I also wasn't overly enamoured by what I was reading until more than halfway through when the story and the writing both suddenly took off.  <br />Love it or loathe it, Pierre's debut novel is a totally contemporary and relevant satire the reading world needs. A timely wake up call.	2004-07-01

How such a luminously crafted and finely imagined work of historical fiction can be overlooked in the annual book award stakes in favour of showier but less deserving titles is something presumably only those familiar with the internal politics of book critic awards can understand.<br />&quot;The Siege&quot; is a story about a family who endured and partially survived the extremities of cold, hunger and other devastating hardships inflicted on the people of Leningrad when their city came under siege by the Germans in 1941. The horror of the opening transcript of German intent prepares us for what follows. The opening chapters describe the buzz of ordinary lives albeit under the tyranny of the country's own leadership. Nobody trusts anyone. Even neighbours stay away from those in suspect professions (eg, artists and journalists). But life was still good, you can smell the scent of flowers in the air and the natural aroma of fresh fruit and vegetables from the ground. All this will disappear when the Germans suddenly attack, supplies are cut off , the city is frozen solid, stocks run down and people are reduced to starvation and using their furniture and books as fuel for heating as winter encroaches. Scenes of how healthy adults and bonny children turn into emaciated skeletons, scrabble around for broken bits of wood, boil their leather belts for nutrients, etc will guarantee that you will never again leave any morsel of food uneatened on your dinner plate.<br />We experience the siege of Leningrad through the lives of Anna and her family (her doctor lover Andrei, invalid writer father, his actress mistress Marina and baby brother Kolya). Dunmore's touch of feminism shows through in her vivid characterisation. The womenfolk are warriors compared to the men.  Anna's courage and fortitude, Marina's quiet strength and compatriot Evgenia's irrepressable will to live make them unforgettable characters. They tower above the rest. Anna's feelings towards her father (she knows she's the defacto head of the family after her mother's death), her continuing ambivalence towards Marina, etc are all beautifully nuanced, reflecting Dunmore's uncommon grasp of the politics of human relationship.<br />&quot;The Siege&quot; is a faultless, hugely powerful and emotionally resonant piece of work.

It isn't even a particularly outstanding novel about immigrant lives in the land of milk and honey. I've certainly read better. <br />To begin with, the book is over 400 pages long and grossly overwritten. The plot is gruel thin - there's no narrative momentum to speak of, the story goes nowhere - and the prose is for the most part curiously flat. While it's a huge relief to know that not all young novelists feel the need to write in the manic style so favoured by contemporary writers of today, Ali's writing simply lacks spark. She makes the further mistake of making Hasina write to Nazneen in laboured broken English. I developed a headache reading it. It would help if I half understood it.<br />Thematically, it's also too conservative. Ali doesn't stretch out far enough. Sure, you experience the intergenerational conflict of immigrant families, wonder at the irony of Chanu's romantic homebound longings and so on but isn't it incredible that we don't get to meet a single white person in a story about life in England ?      <br />Ali succeeds best with her characterisation. Nazneen is a picture  of docility, accepting whatever Fate doles out to her...until Karim the young local-born firebrand walks into her life. Chanu is a lovable buffoon - pure bathos - but one that wins our sympathy  -  he is as much a victim of traditional values as Nazneen. Mrs Islam, a bloodsucker masquerading as friend and Razia, Nazneen's one true friend and source of her deliverance are full bodied and wonderfully sketched characters.  But why does Karim seem so underdeveloped and skeletal in contrast ? Maybe Ali didn't bother because he's only the catalyst for Nazneen's transformation, nothing more. In any case, Nazneen's affair with Karim is perhaps the least convincing aspect of the story. It has a false note about it and for that reason, I never bought it.<br />&quot;Brick Lane&quot; isn't a bad novel. It has its moments but these don't justify the huge praise lavished on it. It is in my opinion possibly the least worthy candidate for last year's Man Booker Prize. Disappointing.	2004-06-04
US	52572105	R349YQFRJC7HRB	0241142040	705609587	The Light of Day	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A noir-ish thriller about murder, love and betrayal	Once you've adjusted to Swift's trademark narrative pacing, his rapid fire interior monologue and fragmented half sentences reflecting the instant imaging of narrator George's ruminations, there's much in &quot;The Light Of Day&quot; to enthrall you and keep the pages turning. <br />The story - a psychological thriller about murder, love and betrayal - pans out in compelling noir-ish fashion with George, a former disgraced policeman turned private investigator, as the novel's sole narrator. In fact, we don't ever meet anybody else (even the novel's heroine Sarah) in the first person. In other words, we live in George's mind and have no means of ascertaining the reliability or otherwise of his version of events that unfold. We gather very early on that an assignment starting out like any other soon proves to be a cataclysmic event that turns his life upside down. He is inexorably drawn to his client Sarah, hence hopes to deliver &quot;good news&quot; about the future of her marriage (evidence of unselfish love ?), yet secretly harbours hopes of supplanting her faithless husband in his client's affection.  Confusing ? Not quite. Once you've figured out George's own murky past, in particular the terrible burden he has had to bear to protect his mother's false happiness, all will become clear. Swift keeps you guessing till the very end. I can't agree with reviewers who complain that &quot;what really happened that fateful night&quot; is predictable and less than earth shattering. I thought it was deeply truthful and powerfully resonant. Betrayal turns love in an instant into hate and then back again.  <br />The novel isn't obviously overwritten, though its arguably thin premise makes it seem so. At least, there is the feeling that Swift repeats himself once past the half way mark. Perhaps Swift meant to simulate the workings of a ruminative mind. Who knows ? In any case, Swift fans won't be disappointed with &quot;The Light of Day&quot;. It's stylishly crafted and executed to perfection. Highly recommended.	2004-05-27

Set somewhere unidentified in Eastern Europe, the smell of death, destruction and ethnic cleansing permeates the air from its opening pages. You know something evil is about to happen and shortly - the chapters are structured by the hours of a day - but you don't know why and to whom. Donovan keeps you guessing till the very end. <br />The novel pans out as a stagy two man dialogue about the history of evil in world civilisation. Throughout the ages, evil has been perpetrated and justified in the name of religion, trade, even progress, but what remains are the ashes of human suffering and destruction that gets lost in the annals of recorded history. The telescope of the book's title, a metaphor of great power and resonance, peered into from back to front gives a totally different view of the living truth of history. <br />The baker and the schoolteacher. One commands the other to dig a trench in the icy winds out in the wintry open. Who's doing what to whom. We can only guess. The baker's knowledge of life is defined and circumscribed by his craft and his instinct to survive . He has no soul. The schoolteacher is a learned man but he has experienced love and suffers for it. As the hours lapse and time inevitably runs out, something does happen and we will know why.<br />ST is an incredibly moving piece of work of surprising depth and maturity. It is a thinking man's novel that raises many thought provoking issues about evil, life and love. One of best new novels I have read this year.	2004-05-23

Omovo's troubled life is a metaphor for the myriad problems facing the African continent. The green scumpool Okri's hero paints could be the picture the author has of Africa in his mind. Quite apart from the dirt, the grinding poverty, and the soul destroying corruption underlying the system at all levels, Okri rails against the &quot;thought police&quot; who are out to muzzle the press and the free expression of artists, as well as the deliberate inefficiencies and regular cover-ups by the law enforcement agencies. You can also feel his pain and anger in the passages describing how blacks are reduced to obsequious monkeys sucking up to their supercilious white superiors in their own country. <br />The tragic ending to the love story brings us full circle. The mysterious dead girl Omovo discovers in the swamp earlier on becomes like a bad omen, a premonition. But it's more than that. The girl is also a symbol of the problems that are swept underneath the carpet and conveniently forgotten.<br />Okri's prose is full of poetic images that fill the senses. His characters occasionally withdraw into themselves, reinforcing the contemplative nature of the novel. Though his social commentary is far more rivetting than the love story, the latter is nonetheless essential and an integral part of the novel. He does get a little lost in the final pages but that doesn't make &quot;Dangerous Love&quot; less than a fine, fine novel by a great African novelist.	2004-05-22

It was even considered good enough to be shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. I can see why. It is the uncomplicated yet articulate nature, and sheer precision and razor sharp quality of Heller's prose that impresses me most.  She makes good writing seem so easy. That's because she hails from a tradition of fictional writing that includes icons like Muriel Spark.<br />Don't expect the plot or the Sheba-Barbara relationship to develop along the lines of the infamous duo in \\"The Talented Mr Ripley\\". It is simply nowhere as sinister and readers expecting otherwise are bound to be disappointed. The story is also not about Sheba. She's only its nominal subject. It's really about Barbara, a strong touch of irony considering that she's the one telling us about Sheba's scandal but in the process reveals more about herself to us than the subject of her tale.<br />Sheba is this attractive and middle class pottery teacher who shows her silly dippy side when she falls for an under-aged student who has a fleeting crush on her. Her disgraceful affair, once out in the public domain, wreaks havoc on her family and professional life. Lost, in shock and despair, she finds Barbara, her lonely spinster colleague who's in desperate need to be needed, just waiting by the side to step in and take charge of her shattered life. Barbara's prim humourless no-nonsense exterior betrays her own lower middle class insecurities. Her jealousy of Sheba's friendship with another teacher Sue doesn't in my opinion make her a closet or unconscious lesbian, more an embittered soul who's absolutely terrified of being an irrelevance to the lives of others. Funnily, or is it just my reading of it, the betrayal scene suggests that it isn't deliberate but accidental, an act of  reflex precipitated by the feeling of hurt, embarrassment and jealousy. The novel winds down satisfactorily though a little unsteadily with just a hint ofunnatural supremacy in a lopsided relationship. <br />NOAS is indeed an excellent novel. It is good solid contemporary literature and deserves to be read and enjoyed.	2004-05-19

It is an inspirational and original book about an incident - the murder of a neighbour's dog - that has taken hold of an autistic child's mind and in the process unsettled some dark family secrets which have remained deeply buried within the hearts of the adult community. <br />The story is narrated by and told through the eyes of the child, so his perception and understanding of events as they unfold become our own. Mark Haddon's simulation of the autistic child's reality and sensibility is so touching, truthful and poignant I was completely blown away by its emotional resonance. The heartbreak one feels stems from the fact that the autistic child is incapable of interpreting simple messages in conversation. He responds to reality as he sees them, in the only way he knows how, and so misreads cues that should be straightforward to the non-autistic person. <br />Don't let the dog incident distract you. It may be the triggering event that sends everything unrevelling but hardly the story's centre which is firmly rooted in the more complex world of adults. I wonder if Christopher would have been better off wired like the rest of us. I doubt so. There is also surprising depth to Haddon's characterisation. Christopher's father is a saint, his mother much less sympathetic and more difficult to judge, like the Meryl Streep character in Kramer vs Kramer. <br />It's interesting that the book is marketed as both an adult's as well as a children's book. The adult and child reader will have different reactions to the book. Haddon has made an important contribution to contemporary literature. All we can do is read and be enriched by it.	2004-05-09

Books	5	11	27	N	N	Funny, truthful  and outrageous but vastly overated	So what's the big deal about \\"Stupid White Men\\" ? Not much really if you analyze its content, except that Moore has the audacity to shout out loud what many of us instinctly know is true about the state of the nation in America in the most funny and outrageous way. His is the voice of the silent majority and for this reason alone is likely to bring about catharthic release in all but the most right wing of readers. Yet one can't help but feel that the book for all its crackerjack reader-friendly in-your-face humour is itself probably guilty of hyperbole and undeserving of serious scrutiny. At times, its relentless vitriolic and diatribe against all and sundry becomes tiresome and sadly reductive. <br />Read it anyway.

Even the strange bleeding phenomenon that visits Einar/Lili is treated in the most clear-eyed and unsensational way. Unafraid to explore the subterranean realms of human consciousness, his dare and genius is to make us believe the impossible, that love can transcend the inversion of a normal conjugal relationship. Which wife would ask her husband to slip into a woman's shoes if only for a pose ......unless she senses - albeit subconsciously - something essentially female about his inner self ? Right through the early stages of Einar's transformation into Lili, it almost seems like Greta is coaxing Lili out of Einar's closet without a thought for the implications of their relationship. With Lili out in the open, Einar's personality withdraws, grows indistinct and then disappears. Only when Lili finally emerges and falls in love does Greta recognise that the Einar/Greta relationship has unalterably ended.<br />Ebershoff's curious tale of an unusual love is genuinely heartwarming and never less than absorbing. It is also relentlessly sad and true. A beautifully written novel.	2004-04-22

Timothy Findley's \\"Spadework\\" doesn't conform to any specific type or genre in literary fiction. To begin with, it's most certainly not a murder mystery or thriller the blurb suggests it is - Penguin Books, its UK publisher, should be rapped for being misleading. So, what kind of book is it ? A tale of marital breakdown, lust and ambition among members of a theatrical community in Ontario ? Hard to say. <br />But love - all sorts of love - takes centre stage in \\"Spadework\\". There's conjugal love between struggling stage actor Griffin Kincaid and his prop designer wife Jane, love between parent and child (as between the Kincaids and their son Will), love between family members (as between gardener Luke and his young troubled uncle Jesse), homosexual love or lust of stage director Jonathan for Griffin, mature love between housekeeper Mercy and Luke, and Jane's idealised love for the Bell repairman Milos.  According to Findley, love caves in under pressure, its manifest qualities change albeit temporarily.  Like an elastic band, it finds its original shape eventually. <br />Findley's characterisation doesn't always succeed. His supporting characters like Mercy, Luke, Milos and Claire fare much better than his protagonists. With each page, I found Jane increasingly shrill and irritating and I began to feel she deserves what's happening to her.....until Milos turns up and she wanders into a dream world of her own and becomes interesting as a human being once again. Griffin's character is the most problematic. He's supposed to be desperate and ambitious and his sudden abandonment of his family for Jonathan's casting couch is a move that suggests he has sold his soul to the devil - remember Rosemary's husband in \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" ? - but in truth, he's a wimp and his return to the family fold after Jonathan's confessional is a bizarre twist that strains credibility and ends the story on a hastily executed feel-good note.        <br />Quite apart from revealing his roots asa playwright, Findley's liberal use of asides and self directed utterances to punctuate his narrative is also a devise that doesn't quite work. Indeed, I found it unhelpful and distracting and gives the novel an incongruous feel about it. There is nevertheless much to enjoy in \\"Spadework\\". The good parts are excellent and they'll make it all worthwhile for you.	2004-04-18

From start to finish, the pace never lets up. The refugee war criminal with blood on his hands is harboured by friends in high places and hunted relentless by enemies seeking revenge for the war crimes he perpetrated during the Nazi era in France. His razor-sharp antennae goes into overdrive each time danger approaches, with surprising results. That he is a ruthless criminal with a dangerously flawed conscience there is no doubt, so when he comes to his sticky end, there's only the feeling that he's had his just deserts. <br />But has justice been done ? What about his powerful protectors ? Aren't they just as guilty, if not more ? Moore's insightful portrayal of the Catholic Church, its monastries, underground sects and secretive subsidiary organs as human institutions is a powerful reminder that the Church, however catholic, is ultimately comprised of individuals, each with his own thoughts and beliefs, and as long as its members remain also members of secular society, the Church cannot stop them from acting in secret according to the dictates of their own conscience, however flawed or wrongminded.<br />Moore is a master of this genre. \\"The Statement\\" has all the ingredients of a first class thriller that will satisfy his fans and win over lots more.	2004-04-12

Her latest, &quot;The Photograph&quot;, is an intriguing little novel about the elusive nature of identity in life and its amorphous quality when resurrected from the collective memory of family and friends in death. We know nothing directly of the dead Kath except from the impressions of Glyn, Elaine, Nick, Polly and others. Despite its intensely intimate quality, the story pans out as a mystery or a near whodunit with the promise of a tell-all at the end, and that unfortunately may be its weakest aspect because &quot;the truth about Kath&quot; as revealed by her friend Mary Packard in the last chapter is strangely predictable and less than earth shattering.  Everyone seems to be in agreement that Kath is this artless beauty whose free spirited soul sets her apart from the rest who must deal with the ordinary mundane matters of life and career, so when the real Kath finally emerges, it turns out she isn't what we expect. Loneliness and the lack of genuine warmth and intimacy finally claims her life too. In their separate attempts to get to the bottom of circumstances surrounding the incriminating photograph, each of the others reveal more of their own ugly nature than of the ghostly Kath, eg  Glyn's selfish conceit, Elaine's cold-bloodedness, Nick's weakness, Polly's lack of filial feelings, etc. Is it any wonder that we never caught the real likeness of Kath from the secret ruminations of the others. &quot;The Photograph&quot; is a beautifully written novel and an immensely enjoyable read.

Its screen adaptation may have guaranteed it pride of place on the shelves of every household, but I would argue that the book has been mostly ill served by the movie. Though largely faithful to the plot except for the cop-out crowd pleasing ending, the movie unwisely reduced the character of Carlo, a full-blooded and heroic figure comparable in stature to Corelli, to a mere walk-on part. <br />At its centre, CCM is a tragic romance set in the island of Cephallonia in Greece during the start of the Second World War. Pelagia, the daughter of a folk medicine doctor is betrothed to Mandras, a local illiterate fisherman but falls in love with Captain Corelli, an unwilling enemy soldier more comfortable wielding his mandolin than his rifle during the island's occupation by the Italian army. When Mandras suspects the truth, he joins the country's communist insurgents and returns with vengeance on his mind. But fate has other designs for Pelagia and Corelli. A powerful earthquake devastates the entire war-torn community of Cephallonia. Corelli is seriously injured in the war against the Germans when Mussolini collapses and Italy pulls out of its alliance with the Nazis, but he survives and returns to his homeland only to discover decades later of how life might have panned out for him and Pelagia, had it not been for some unfortunate misunderstanding of each other's circumstances.   <br />With a plot so familiar, it is a supreme testimony to de Bernieres' genius that he manages to avoid the pitfalls of melodrama.  When he tells his story, he has at least five other pistons firing away, so there's always another dimension unfolding to keep the reader enthralled, like Carlo's intriguing series of heartbreaking confessionals, the Greek prime minister's despairing monologue, and the lovely touch of magical realism in Mandras' final scenes with the dolphins. Even Mussolini gets to reveal his soul to the reader. CCM also boasts a large supporting cast of fascinating characters like Dr Iannis, Drosoula, the priest, the royalist and the communist, and others too many to mention - truly a feat of inspired characterisation. There are also lots to savour of de Bernieres' humorous political commentary on the motives of the Germans, the Italians, the British and the Greeks during the War.  <br />CCM is truly a magnificent fictional work. It is headily romantic, funny, lyrical, colourful, and magical. It is also hugely entertaining and is sure to be read for generations to come. Forget about the movie. Read the book.	2004-03-16

Shena Mackay's latest novel \\"Heligoland\\" has been shortlisted for several prestigious UK book awards including the Orange Prize. That comes as no surprise as Mackay's pedigree is quite impeccable and \\"Heligoland\\" is just the sort of novel that's aimed at book critics to win heaps of prizes but will be challenged to sell ten copies to the great reading public inside (let alone outside) the Great Britain. Put simply, it is too writer-ly, obscure, quirky and parochial in its orientation and for that reason won't be a natural candidate for any reader's recommended reading list.<br />Mackay's story about a bunch of socially inept, period outcasts, antiquated relics and leftovers from the last world war, squatting and living uncomfortably together in a clamber-shell shaped building in South London called the Nautilus doesn't offer a very promising premise for an interesting story. It wouldn't be so bad to have the plot randomly overrun by a wide cast of tedious, colourless and instantly forgettable minor characters if we had solid central characters to serve as anchor for the story. The truth is that neither Rowena Snow - the novel's heroine - Celeste Zylberstein, Francis Campion, nor Gus Crabb make compelling characters. They're drab and boring and they don't leave any impression and that's the crux of the problem.  <br />Mackay's prose is flawless, beautifully crafted and vividly imagined in fine descriptive language but it is also economical to a fault.  Dialogue is used so sparingly there's a distinct lack of immediacy to the plot, causing the scenes to run into each other. Besides, Mackay makes no concession to the foreign reader, so you're likely to be lost (like me) in the face of constant references to landmarks, places and objects that will have no meaning to anyone living outside of the locale. It's not until you reach the final 30 pages or so that things start to happen, some measure of coherence is established and you begin to see the point of it all. By then,it's too late and you're just relieved you've made it to the end. And it's a short book.<br />Book prize nominee or not, I really didn't enjoy \\"Heligoland\\". The critics seem to love it. They have made their case but I cannot honestly imagine it having much of an appeal to the general reading public.	2004-02-13

I was going to tackle Vikram Seth's magnus opus &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; but being deeply suspicious of big (often overwritten) books, I chickened out when I saw how voluminous it was. So I did the next best thing and plumbed for &quot;An Equal Music (AEM)&quot; and oh...what pure unadulterated joy to read some of the most beautiful, luscious and lyrically luminous prose ever to have graced the printed page. Seth is surely a master of the written word.     <br />So, believe the reviewers when they wax lyrical about Seth's eloquence or come seemingly close to overstatement with their claims that Seth's writing IS music or at least transmogrified into the music he so articulately writes about. There's more good news. While classical music lovers will be blissfully lost in seventh heaven with Seth - himself no doubt a music afficionado - the musically ignorant won't feel in the least alienated because music is only a metaphor for the love story that lies at the centre of AEM. The friction and endless struggles among members of the Maggiore quartet mirror perfectly the emotional twists and turns Michael and Julia endure in their tentative attempts to re-engage after a fateful misunderstanding in Vienna which led to the sudden and tempestuous break up in their relationship many years ago. The story is really about love, lost and found and the ownership of love. Julia was never Michael's to have. The violin on loan from an elderly neighbour clearly was.  <br />Though a resounding critical success, the novel in my view peaks out too early, so that for much of the middle section it feels like it's treading water as the plot runs out of steam and starts to sag. Seth couldn't sustain the high he hit with an amazing account of how Michael researched and sleuthed his way through virtually every second hand record dealer in London in search of that elusive string quintet in C minor by Beethoven, coveted his treasure only to lose it the same day when he spots Julia sitting in abus that's moving alongside his own in London. After a rather turgid (some would say mildly tiresome) middle section, Seth recovers some of the lost dramatic impetus with a marvellously observed auction scene that has all the nail-chewing excitement of the real event. You feel your palms sweating and tiny beads of perspiration gathering on the crown of your forehead as he tells it. Piers didn't land the item he was eyeing but that's no tragedy - Seth seems to be saying - because there's no love in his life. Michael, on the other hand, may have lost Julia even before the story began, but because there's love, he gains something immeasurably precious to him to remind him of that love. There's love in music, or music in love. Or both. Whichever.<br />&quot;An Equal Music&quot; is a wondrous piece of fictional writing that will surely endure. It shouldn't be missed.	2004-02-07

Modesty, restraint and austerity typifies the tone of this vividly imagined tale of Dutch painter Vermeer's portrait of a maiden now known forever as the &quot;girl with a pearl earring&quot;. Though its author has declared the novel to be a work of fiction, such is the resonance and quiet power radiating from the heart of this simple tale I can't see how readers (and moviegoers) are ever going to regard the novel as anything other than being based on a true story. This is only Chevalier's second novel and already she has made her mark on the literary scene with a wonderful little book that is simply for keeps.<br />Chevalier's precise, stripped down yet luminous prose conjures a mental picture of 17th Century Holland so vivid it stays like a painting in your mind's eye. Like the everyday material painter Vermeer works with in his studio, colours, shades and hues feature prominently in the language. Chevalier's characters are also never less than sharp or finely etched. Our heroine and subject, Gret, may be outwardly subservient as befits the times but she has fire in her belly. She is clearly no wimp underneath. Catharina, the master's wife, may be the story's most odious character but she is also its most pitiable. She's bad tempered, surly, untidy, clumsy and graceless. Her husband won't paint her or even allow her to enter his studio because she's so ungainly and incongruous with the beauty he's trying to capture on canvas. She's bitterly jealous and suspicious of the lowly maid her husband secretly paints because she knows she herself is only good to him as a breeder. Or Maria Thins, the conniving mother-in-law who doesn't miss a beat or betray a conscience when she pimps shamelessly to guarantee bread on the family's table. The devilish Cornelia - a changeling child if ever there was one - is another unforgettable character. The character of the master painter Vermeer, silent and a ghostly figure at the edge of a scene most of the time, is deliberately underwritten but nevertheless articulately defined by his gestures.<br />At the centre of the novel is Gret's unrequited love for her master which is expressed most touchingly in the suffering she endures for him. Most tellingly, she withholds physical intimacy with her butcher suitor, young Pieter, until AFTER she has allowed her master to see her without her scarf on. In her own mind, she has saved her &quot;virginity&quot; for the beloved master whom she knows she could never have, so when Gret finally permits her suitor whom she doesn't love to take rough liberties with her, the act becomes a powerful metaphor of sacrifice and exorcism of a hopeless love. GWAPE only stumbles when its author makes an unwise concession to popular taste with an ending that's smaltzy, sentimental and frankly disappointing. <br />This one false note aside, &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; is a beautifully crafted novel, one that is destined to have a long shelf life and enchant readers for many generations to come. I enjoyed it tremendously. I'm sure you will too. Highly recommended.	2004-01-24

His is a clarion voice of reason that speaks of the dysfunctionality permeating contemporary society today. <br />The Drummond family is a microcosm of a society that has gone to seed and needs to rediscover its own validity and direction. Apart from matriach Janet whose worst sin may be to accept without question the poor hand of cards life has dealt her, the others (notably ex-husband Ted, sons Wade and Bryan, and their respective spouses Nickie, Beth and Shw) are lowlifes, fanatics or nuts temporarily out of touch with their own humanity. Of course, there's also Sarah, the crippled-by-thalidomide but high achiever daughter whose participation in the historic space shuttle launch is the occasion that brings this sleazy, crazy family together in Orlando, Florida. Their other common denominator is disease - HIV mainly  - a topical metaphor for society's ills.     <br />AFAP is a non-stop action packed slapstick comedy told through side-splitting scenes of witty, wacky and wise cracking dialogue that literally brings tears to your eyes. Tears of laughter at their crazy manic exploits and the absurdity of situations the Drummonds find themselves in. But there are also shining moments of genuine sadness, poignance and wisdom that stayed with me long after the book has ended. Most touching of all is the primal unconditional love that survives between mother and son. My favourite lines in the novel are \\"Blame is just a lazy person's way of making sense of chaos\\" and \\"We're the untended garden, the garden that lost its gardeners\\".  <br />Some readers have complained about Coupland's undue obsession with action and plot. They have a point. There are a couple of creaky moments in AFAP that strain credibility, like Janet hooking up suddenly with rogue millionaire Florian after a chummy telephone conversation.  But that's a minor lapse. AFAP is afast paced, zany, crackerjack of a novel that'll enthral you because it's funny and touching and it manages to transcend its nasty subject and farcical plot with oodles of charm, honesty and realism. I enjoyed the book tremendously. I'm sure you will too. <br />I also see AFAP translating brilliantly to film, so if it's not already optioned, the studios should start talking to Coupland.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-11

Though the current wave of fanaticism sweeping the Muslim world may be the motivating factor behind this latest publication, the premise of Kimball's book is far wider in its reach as he demonstrates how evil throughout the ages has been perpertrated in the name of God and religion. <br />The Five Warning Signs he discusses at length are so basic and obvious they're almost commonsensical. Through much of it, you may even wonder why such a book needs to be written. To anyone who feels this way, my advice is to hang in there. Chapter 7 (&quot;An Inclusive Faith Rooted In A Tradition&quot;) alone is worth the price of the book. Kimball's treatise that all men follow their &quot;spiritual compass&quot; in their quest for God (or the Truth) is the nugget at the heart of the book. It is conceivable that some Christians may feel uncomfortable with Kimball's ecumenical conclusions, but that's too bad 'cos it's the only convincing way of making sense of our multireligious world. <br />&quot;When Religion Becomes Evil : Five Warning Signs&quot; is an excellent book, well written and accessible, and one that deserves to find a wide readership.	2004-01-10

There is no better murder mystery writer than P D James. She is without doubt the absolute best and the reigning queen in her given genre. There isn't a single James book I haven't read and not enjoyed. \\"The Murder Room (MR)\\" is no exception....so if I seem unduly critical of her latest, it's only because I've grown accustomed to her usual high standards and can't help but judge its merits against her very best works.<br />Adam Dagliesh as romantic hero in MR may be poignant only to James' fans. Newcomers are likely to find Dagliesh's new guise oddly irrelevant. Colleague Inspector Kate Miskin shows her slightly bitter and cryptic side and though it's not always a pretty sight, it's a contemporary reminder that the effects of the English class system haven't completely worn off. The characters that populate MR are typically Jamesian, hard, cynical, and ruthless and there's none more unpleasant than Caroline Dupayne, one of the three trustees of the Dupayne Museum, whose fate depends on whether the trustees agree to carry on. That woman chills your blood and wilts your soul. There are also the usual damaged people who make excellent suspects (eg, Tally, Muriel), so once you've met them, you know you're in familiar territory.<br />MR doesn't offer anything new but at 83, James shouldn't be expected to deliver anything groundbreaking. Though I enjoyed the book immensely - her writing is never less than sharp and exquisite     - the plotting, I felt, was a little weak and ultimately unconvincing from the second murder onwards. There are too many red herrings in there, suggesting a lack of cogency in plot development. The identity of the murderer, when it is revealed, doesn't surprise though the motive isn't remotely commensurate with the violence and viciousness of the crime.<br />Enough with the negative comments. There's always integrity and quality in James' work as she is never less than erudite in her research. Despite the above criticisms, MR still makes a rivetting read and you can do a lot worse than picking up a copy and finding out for yourself.	2004-01-04
US	52572105	R1QVL9XUW988KZ	0060529709	420660459	Everything Is Illuminated: A Novel	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Novel and inventive, but not equal to its hype	A great deal of fuss has been made of Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\". Indeed, the inner sleeves are covered with so much critical hype I couldn't help but venture out to find out for myself. Well, is it the blazingly original masterpiece everyone says it is ? Probably not, as I have mixed feelings about it.<br />Sure, it's daring, swanky and boldly irreverential in its novel format. The book pans out as a combination of letters, backward and sometimes logic defying time scales, dream sequences, poems, and selected passages from the Jewish Holy Book. Using a cross cultural alter ego to tell a story of personal devastation and loss, of memory and fate that reaches back to the depths of the deep distant past, Foer also paints -  by inference and suggestion than narrative detail - an unspeakably bleak landscape of human misery left by the Nazi era on the surviving Jewish community in Europe. The novel is at its most emotionally resonant and powerful when Foer is at his least deliberate, consciously clever and innovative, and the linear storyline is allowed to develop and find a natural rhythm to its flow...but unfortunately, these moments don't come often enough. That's because it keeps getting interrupted by Foer's obsessive need to keep pace with the not very illuminating parallel story from the distant past. <br />The direct Russian-to-English translation of the English language may be funny and inventive - up to a certain point -  but beyond it, the novelty wears out, it gets tiresome and starts to grate. It doesn't help that Foer isn't an assured enough writer at this stage to resist using gimmicks. Sammy Davis Jr, Jr, the narrator Alex's pet dog, is clearly one. Having got his early laughs out of this \\"character\\", poor Sammy makes his exit quite inexplicably without being noticed, or did Foer simply forget while churning out his cast of a myriad of one-scene-only characters ? <br />Most disconcerting of all is that Foer doesn't evenhave the good grace to play it straight when he drops the big one on us. I had to flip back and forth between certain easy-to-miss but crucial passages from different parts of the novel to make out the secret that should have made the mind bending reading exercise all worthwhile. <br />Quite apart from Foer's reliance on unlikely coincidences for its denouement, \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\", while brave,original and experimental, isn't the assured literary work of groundbreaking importance it is made out to be. The good parts are brilliant, inspired even but overall, it's a far too contrived piece of fictional writing to be hailed as a masterpiece. Next time, Foer should just let his hair down and see where it takes him.	2003-12-24

Last year, they picked Jonathan Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\". This year, they chose \\"Middlesex\\", Jeffrey Eugenides' sophomore effort and follow-up to \\"The Virgin Suicides\\". <br />A magnificent opus truly deserving of the huge and unanimous praise heaped upon it, Eugenides' genius lies in taking a quaint and offbeat topic - hermaphroditism - and transforming it into a shimmering beautiful and incandescent metaphor for change (writ large) that must inevitably have destabilised the status quo of intergenerational relationships within immigrant families that have settled in America for decades. The Stephanides are a Greek family hailing from a little village in Asia Minor. Driven out of their homes by the terrible racial violence that broke out between the Greeks and the Turks, Lefty and Desdemona fled - incognito - to America to join their cousin. Reinventing a past to hide a terrible secret taboo that will weigh upon Desdemona for the rest of her life, they started a family and business ventures that would leave some of their highest and lowest points in their early immigrant lives.   <br />Lefty and Desdemona got off without a scratch when they had Milton. But nobody suspected or was prepared to believe anything was wrong when puberty seemed to elude their granddaughter Calliope. While Calliope struggled valiantly with the pain of lacking a clear sexual identity, her family turned a blind eye, so when the chips were down and there was nowhere to run, Calliope did the only thing possible.<br />\\"Middlesex\\" is simply a great, great novel. Better than \\"The Corrections\\", which I also enjoyed and admired. There are few modern novelists who write with the generosity, lucidity and honesty of Eugenides. His prose is never bombastic or cute or coy even when dealing with an unusual subject. Calliope/Cal are so palpably real and human we never stop believing or caring for them. <br />If there's one American novel you have time for in 2003, let it be \\"Middlesex\\". It is an important novel and will surely enter the portals of Enduring American Literature.	2003-12-20
US	52572105	RKI8OUW9J1OTE	0679749837	178273647	In Between the Sheets	Books	2	9	13	N	N	Best forgotten - not even for big McEwan fans !	I'm a big, big fan of Ian McEwan's. I've read and loved virtually everything he's written, especially \\"Black Dogs\\" and \\"Atonement\\", so it's doubly disappointing for me to say that \\"In Between The Sheets\\", his second collection of short stories, is without doubt the worst and only substandard piece of work he has put out so far. Granted, what we have here is very early McEwan but that doesn't excuse the amateurish and shoddy quality of these mostly pointless vignettes. \\"First Love, Last Rites\\", his earliest work, wasn't McEwan at his prime but it was more than halfway decent and contained more than a trace of promise of his developing craft as a short story writer and novelist. \\"In Between The Sheets\\" just seems like scraping the bottom of the barrel.<br />I can't name anything in here that is remotely memorable. Indeed, it was so bad I hardly finished the book. \\"Pornography\\" is mundane and pedestrian. It's been done to death (and better) by others. \\"Reflections Of A Kept Ape\\" almost succeeds - could the ape be the retarded child of the woman ? are the ape's sexual fantasies just its hallucination ? I haven't a clue what \\"Two Fragments\\" is all about. \\"Dead As They Come\\" is ludicrous. By the time I got to \\"In Between The Sheets\\", I lost interest and couldn't wait for this slim volume to end. <br />The publishers should quietly delete this title from McEwan's catalogue as it diminishes his tall standing among the great contemporary writers of today.	2003-12-07
US	52572105	R2VMJH114SSDDY	0449908798	544951661	Duplicate Keys	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Not Smiley's usual but still an excellent murder mystery	Jane Smiley writes about families and relationships, not murder mysteries, so it's a feather in her cap for versatility that she acquits herself more than decently on this atypical novel of hers. The murders have already taken place before we begin, so the rest of the novel has us backtracking through a minefield of relationships that once bound the friends together. Quite clearly, the network has collapsed beneath the growing rot that nobody seemed to care to notice until the inevitable happened. The friendship, if you could call it that, was undermined by a combination of sexual betrayal, professional jealousies and other dependencies and left to find its own bloody equilibrium. The narrator Alice Ellis' voice isn't an unequivocal one. It's hard to nail her personality down or even decide whether she's likeable or not. She's bitter, insecure, vulnerable, defiant and bitchy all at the same time. But then again, we are reminded that Smiley is always more interested in the people than the plot and so it shouldn't be too surprising that we get an edgy character for a heroine and some excellent characterisation to boot.<br />Some readers have complained about the identity of the murderer being predictable. I don't. If there's an awkward and unsatisfactory element in the story, it's in the romantic subplot. Henry may be the secret lover who lives across the street but he doesn't belong. He should have been saved for Smiley's next book about Alice. Smiley may have set out to write a different novel but she couldn't help but leave large traces of her familiar genre behind. Still, \\"Duplicate Keys\\" is a hugely enjoyable novel. Recommended.	2003-11-19
US	52572105	R1NG4X460CM5ND	038550408X	686540144	Property: A Novel	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Spare, restrained but no less powerful : a literary triumph	Valerie Martin's Orange Prize winning novel \\"Property\\" opens with an unforgettable scene which hints at sexual perversion straight from Tennessee Williams territory. But Martin is a mistress of restraint, economy and understatement. She shows how in her hands, less is more.  Eschewing sensationalism, she serves up some of the most spare yet articulately written prose I have read in recent years, recalling a style that has become unfashionably rare among contemporary fiction writers.   <br />\\"Property\\" aptly describes the relationship that existed between white plantation owners and their black slaves during the 1800s in the deep south of America.  Less obviously, it also characterises the relationship between men and women, whose legal status in society relegates them to the position of chattel. Should it therefore surprise readers that we have a cold, unfeeling and utterly self-absorbed heroine in Manon, a hapless young woman trapped in an arranged and loveless marriage to a boor, a philanderer, and a pervert ? Can we expect chattel to behave humanly towards other chattel, when its own humanity has been denied rightful expression ?  Note how Sarah, Manon's slave and her husband's kept woman, remains almost silent throughout. The few words spoken between mistress and slave never defined their owner-chattel relationship more eloquently. The thinly disguised contempt Sarah feels for her mistress to whom she was \\"gifted\\", mirrors the cruelty - born of frustration and sexual jealousy - of  Manon, who relentlessly pursues her property rights when Sarah escapes only to realise she has gained a hollow victory.  The novel achieves its dramatic climax in a scene which has Manon eating her heart out upon discovery that Sarah, her property, has at least experienced albeit briefly the trappings of being a white man, when she herself will forever be condemned as his property in her own polite society. The irony of this observation cannot escape any perceptive reader.<br />Martin's \\"Property\\" is a huge triumph of literary substance over form. It is understated but no less powerful than the emotions its subject evokes. A major achievement and highly, highly recommended.	2003-10-27

It's a fascinating study of genealogy and of the dreaded blood disease (haemophilia) that afflicted Queen Victoria's progeny. This time, we're spared Rendall's nonsensical flirtation with grotesques (eg, &quot;A Sight For Sore Eyes&quot;,&quot;Adam And Eve And Pinch Me&quot;, etc). Instead, we get to burrow into the secret life of the fictional former Lord Henry Nanther, great grandfather of biographer Martin Nanther and physician to QV herself in his time. As Martin tries to make sense of Henry's life for the biography he is writing, he interviews surviving relatives and scrutinises letters between family members for any light that they may shed on his subject. In the process, he stumbles across curious evidence suggesting the existence of a dark family secret, not formally known or understood, though suspected among those affected within the extended family. He hunts down the clues to reveal a truth that is as appalling as it is sensational. In the meantime, we are treated to a mildly interesting subplot involving Jude's (Martin second wife's) desperate attempts to bear a child and yet another subplot - more interesting this time - about the life of peers in the House Of Lords. <br />Figuring who's who isn't too difficult with the help of the two geneology maps that precede the narrative. Nobody with an interest in families should find the proceedings tedious. I didn't. Indeed, I found it fascinating. <br />&quot;The Blood Doctor&quot; is another clear and undisputed triumph for Barbara Vine. Don't miss it !	2003-10-19
US	52572105	R3CJ9I7BLPQJ9T	0345450892	431887144	The Lake of Dead Languages (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Wow...exquisitely written and a real page turner	Carol Goodman's debut novel &quot;The Lake Of Dead Languages (LODL)&quot; is an enthralling thriller and a real page turner.....even if the setting and the plot seems oddly familiar - Donna Tartt's classic &quot;Secret History&quot; springs to mind. But nothing about it feels second hand or derivative because Goodman's writing is so eloquent, gripping and satisfying. Unlike murder mysteries and crime fiction in general, Goodman pays serious attention to characterisation, a major strength because it allows us genuine insight into Jane's psyche and motivation. The darkness at the heart of all-girl Heart Lake School is also eerily reminiscent of the ties that bound Muriel Spark's famous Jean Brodie brood, with hints of lesbianism that thrive in an all-women school environment. The action that takes place on iced up lakes and amidst blinding snow storms, moves backwards and forwards in time, with the present mirroring the past so closely you almost forget where you are but Goodman knows how to keep you turning each page faster as you hurtle towards the denouement. Contrary to the opinion of some reviewers, I didn't find the whodunit element in LODL at all predictable, though there are indeed telling signs of who Jane's nemesis might be. Like in the movies, a significant minor character doesn't just emerge from the past for no rhyme or reason, simply to make up the scenery. More often than not, the character takes on an expanded role only in the movie's last frames where its dramatic role is revealed. That's how it pans out here. So far, so good. Yet ironically, it is in the story's final pages that Goodman lets her flawless judgement slip, with a wrap-up that is just a little too pat, betraying a puzzling need for all the loose ends to find their rightful place. Pity, as life isn't at all neat and tidy and Goodman ought to have had the confidence and the courage to resist a Hollywood style ending that spoiled it a bit for me. Nevertheless, I still give it a 5-star rating simply because LODL makes such a fantastic read. Highly recommended.	2003-10-19
US	52572105	R12D32QXRFT6RY	0375414622	726962617	Platform	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Powerful & courageous,	With \\"Platform\\", Michel Houellebecq has disproved the adage that you can't follow up a groundbreaking debut with something even better. If truth be told, I thought \\"Atomised\\" was original but wildly overpraised, but when I finished \\"Platform\\", it felt like a train had run through me. I was floored by its power, vision and courage. Unlike many books which peter out after a promising start, \\"Platform\\" gets better with each page and ends on a shattering climax and a devastating afternote. <br />Like \\"Atomised\\", the author speaks directly to us through the voice of the novel's protagonist (also named Michel), so you'd be forgiven for simply assuming that it's Michel Houellebecq himself who is telling the story. This perspective is reinforced by the author's unique trademark of making political and social commentary an integral part of the novel's plot. So when critics lambast Michel (the character) for being racist, anti-Islamic and all the rest of it, it's hard to escape levelling these same charges against the author.<br />But while it's tempting though surely missing the point to dismiss much of \\"Platform\\" as a diatribe against the lurid excesses of third world sex tourism, the madness of terrorism, etc, it isn't difficult to locate the tongue-in-cheek yet bitter irony in Houellebecq's view of the 21st century world. The pimps and whores of the third world regard the sex trade as a means of survival, and that's alright because everybody has a right to live, their customers - mostly pathetic human specimens in need of getting themselves a life like the early Michel and his failed bureaucrat friends - are driven to such levels of depravity and despair by their own society which makes gratification of their primal sex urge such a complicated and unattainable affair. So the graphic sex scenes featuring Michel, his bisexual girlfriend Valerie and many anonymous others in twosomes or threesomes are funny, absurd, sexy, yet strangely touching. Houellebecq has elevated sex to hyperbole in \\"Platform\\" to suggest that Western society may have dug its own grave on the subject of sex from playing too many mind games. Hence the need to \\"Look East\\" to rediscover their lost but false paradise.<br />Houellebecq's narrative voice can be distancing and alienating, especially when he's being cryptic during his periodic lapses into commentary, so the really big surprise is that by the end of the story, he has transformed Michel into a real human being and against our better judgement, we begin to feel for him and even find ourselves hurting badly over his loss. <br />\\"Platform\\", Houellebecq's sophomore effort is not only vastly superior to \\"Atomised\\", it is a truly great novel. I am tempted to call it a masterpiece. There aren't too many novels this powerful, daring and courageous. Don't miss it !	2003-10-01

It is definitely not for the fainthearted or the casual reader expecting simply a good plot and a decent storyline. You'll have to enjoy literature (written large) to appreciate the wordy but intricately spun prose that flows from the Frazier's pen because nothing very much happens between the novel's first and last pages. <br />Disillusioned and wounded Confederate soldier Inman escapes from the hospital he is interned in and heads for Cold Mountain to reunite with his beloved Ada and that just about sums up the plot. On route to his final destination, Inman encounters a motley crew of personalities including a disgraced preacher, a young war widow and a goatswoman and narrowly escapes death at the bloody hands of Confederates who take the law into their own hands to bring their defectors to justice. As Inman battles the elements, he endures terrible physical deprivation as well as a desperate longing for his beloved. Meanwhile, Ada, brought up as a lady by her recently deceased missionary father finds herself totally at odds with the prospect of having to run a farm by herself. She is saved from this predicament by the sudden appearance of a brusque but practical girl Ruby, who has known nothing but hardship and survival since childhood and between the two of them, they make steady progress turning the farm around. <br />In telling his tale, Frazier dispenses largely with dialogue, choosing to paint his landscape of a new country torn by a war nobody fighting it truly understands with long passages of descriptive prose that is dense and difficult yet eloquent for the sentiments they express. You don't have to be well versed with American Civil War history to understand the references. In fact, Frazier isn't as much interested in the facts of the war as in evoking the feeling of befuddlement that must strike those caught in it. There is no attempt to demonise either side of the North South divide. Evil is evil and its perpetrators are in both Confederate and Federalist camps. But so is goodness and there are little episodes in there that must bring a lump to your throat. There is also something allegorical and beautiful about the story of a fiddler with a tune that is his and isn't his but all of America's. Just like America's multiple perspective of the war.  <br />\\"Cold Mountain\\" may be slow but it is filmable. Let's see whether Anthony Mingella does justice to it. Hopefully, he doesn't commercialise and over dramatise the love story which is a low key but poignant and bitter sweet affair.<br />\\"Cold Mountain\\" is Frazier's stunning debut. It is a masterful piece of work even if it won't be everybody's cup of tea.	2003-09-25

In this Somerset Maugham Award winning book, McEwan displays all the qualities that have come to characterise his style. Unafraid to break taboos or upset social conventions, he forces the boundaries of acceptability and occasionally goes for the jugular when he employs shock tactics to awaken our natural instinct for the dark and the macabre that lies dormant beneath our consciousness. <br />The opening vignette \\"Solid Geometry\\" is fascinating sci-fi-cum-horror fare. I couldn't help stifling a chuckle at the inventive way in which the protagonist finally \\"got rid\\" of his wife. \\"Homemade\\" about the awakening of a boy's sexuality via the only means available to him is another winner, both terrifying and funny. \\"Butterflies\\" and \\"Conversations With A Cupboard Man\\" are more conventional stories about loners and the devastating effect of repression. \\"Last Day Of Summer\\" is a gentle reminder that \\"still waters run deep\\" with grotesques. I don't think I got the essence of \\"Cocker At The Theatre\\" though it seems to be about sexuality and control and how they don't mix. The last two stories are to me the weakest in the collection. The title story seems tame and listless, ie, it goes nowhere, while the closing vignette \\"Disguises\\" is too befuddling to make any sense of. Is the aunt just mad or is she a closet cross dresser and a dominatrix in her little mad house ? Too much of a mindbender for me. <br />\\"First Love, Last Rites\\" is a qualified success. The highs are truly excellent but be prepared for a couple of disappointments.	2003-09-13

Except for its subtle timeline shift, the movie is uncannily faithful to McGrath's novel. I read the book after I watched the movie and scene after scene, it was almost identical, except that Cronenberg decided to leave out the scenes relating to Spider's period of incarceration in a nuthouse. <br />McGrath is a master of the dark, disturbing and macabre. He doesn't mess about and knows how to tell a good story. Brooding and deeply atmospheric, the reader believes what Spider tells him about his childhood, his relationship with his adored mother and hated father, his father's cheap and nasty affair with the neighbourhood barmaid and its fatal consequences. Although a little slow and repetitive when McGrath takes us through Spider's routine as he takes temporary refuge in a half-way house after his release, this is unavoidable and in fact a realistic depiction of the circular illusions in Spider's head.  There's a twist - more than a little twist - at the end which isn't just clever but credible. Quite clearly, Spider didn't just turn loony from his father's beatings. There is just a whiff of a hint of the underlying cause in Cronenberg's movie - I won't say what it is - but I think it's a perceptive take on a less than pat ending.<br />Those who discovered McGrath through his later works like \\"Asylum\\" will find \\"Spider\\" an excellent novel. It deserves the attention it is now getting. Recommended.	2003-09-12

The truth is that Weldon didn't have to make any concessions, let alone pander to the demands of advertising for she had written a winner and nothing should detract from the fact that &quot;The Bulgari Connection&quot; stands head and shoulders above most other titles in the same genre. It is a contemporary, thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining book and one that I would recommend without hesitation to anyone.<br />Weldon knows how to tell a story. She understands humour and how to find that elusive funny bone in readers that shuns mediocrity and the common attempts by many inferior novelists to try and pass off vulgarity and cheap nasty jokes as humour. It is a rare craft that Weldon has mastered and one that she wields with confidence and authority, considering how the story of Grace and Barley and Doris and Walter might in lesser hands have degenerated into farce. She manages to avoid all the pitfalls by making her characters and their feelings real and recognisable. How many readers out there wouldn't identify with the spurned and outgrown older wife or the insecure businessman finding success late in life who think that a trophy wife is all he needs to enter the portals of the rich and successful? Even Doris Dubois, the modern career woman, a guttersnipe and a bitch without scruples or redeeming qualities is a misshapen product of our society. When we laugh and cry at the antics and manoeuvres of these four characters, we're not unaware or unconscious of Weldon's social commentary on life in our modern times. <br />Don't let anyone persuade you that &quot;The Bulgari Connection&quot; is frothy and lightweight. It isn't. It is funny, relevant and entertaining and frankly you can do a lot worse than that.	2003-08-31

Fans of Banville will recognise their favourite author's trademark writing style. Packed from cover to cover with long flowing sentences and beautifully eloquent prose that recalls the flair of the great classical novelists, \\"Shroud\\" is also a psychological thriller that speaks of lies, deceit and the charisma of identity to those desperate to escape their own past and reality. <br />Alex Vander, a celebrated expatriate professor of literature in America, is forced to flee to Europe to confront an enemy figure who threatens to reveal his true identity, expose his long buried past to the world and blow his distinguished career apart. His nemesis is Cassie Cleave, a tormented and slightly crazed lady with demons of her own. From their first meeting in a hotel, there isn't a modicum of doubt that their liaison - surprising in some ways - would lead to tragedy and tears.<br />I'm not giving anything away but just don't imagine Alex to be a replica of that now famous Ripley character from Patricia Highsmith's novel. Alex may be a cantankerous old semi-invalid. He may be selfish, deceitful and lacking in redeeming qualities - his callous treatment of Magda, his long suffering deceased wife is vividly alluded to in flashbacks - but he is no murderer. So, there are far less high points of drama in the revelation than the blurbs at the back of the book would suggest. What Alex, Magda, Cassie and the other characters share in common is an old world heritage of pain, loss and deprivation. That's the real enemy that haunts their past. <br />The story is narrated from Alex's perspective, though Cassie's tale alternates with Alex's for centrestage. Banville is obviously less concerned with plot than with unrevelling the mysteries of the human heart. The love story that develops between Alex and Cassie is surprising and by no means a cliche. It is both touching and heartbreaking, so when the tragedy unfolds, the understated emotional impact is almost unbearable. <br />Banville for me can do no wrong. His \\"The Untouchables\\" is a modern masterpiece. \\"Shroud\\" comes close and should have made it to the Booker shortlist. Read it. You won't be disappointed.	2003-08-17

At the heart of &quot;The Innocent&quot; is a love story between a young Englishman - assigned on a secret mission at the Anglo-American and Russian border of divided Germany - and an older and more experienced frau with a dangerous past (spelled femme fatale).  Without a doubt, the liaison would lead to personal tragedy and other betrayals far beyond the ken of imagination. <br />Built around the love story is an artifice that speaks of espionage and deceit - even between allied partners - that for me proved far more compelling than the story's central concern.  Happily, McEwan doesn't miss a beat, seizing the opportunity to pour scorn on the provincial-mindedness of the English while not condoning the crude display of American superiority. But when the plot starts to move away from Leonard's external life to focus on his passionate love affair with Maria, that's when the story loses its thread and begins to seem rather familiar and predictable. Even the ex-husband's reappearance and the outcome of his encounter with the couple on their engagement night plays like film noir melodrama. But wait, just as McEwan never ever disappoints, his writing is never ever less than riveting. From there on, the reader is kept in constant nail-chewing mode pondering poor Leonard's fate as he watches him try desperately to bury the evidence that would incriminate him. For the first time, McEwan delivers a denouement that may be written a little too large. Sure, it made my jaw drop but you can't help thinking afterwards......is this believable ? <br />Quite apart from it being not his style, McEwan would have outraged our sense of morality had he allowed a &quot;happily-ever-after&quot; ending for Leonard and Maria. No such luck. Before the final curtains falls, we wouldbe treated to a letter in a fast forward that would explain all and move the most hardened heart to tears. It would also win over any dissenter for the novel's occasional lapse into melodrama. &quot;The Innocent&quot; isn't my favourite McEwan novel but it's got all the ingredients of a great novel which combined with his familiar trademarks and flourishes makes it a winner for me. Highly recommended.	2003-07-22

Richly praised by book critics, the public has embraced it unreservedly by buying large quantities of it to ensure that it stays high in the bestsellers list. What's so special about it ? I've read it, yet I can't say I know the answer.<br />Perhaps it is down to Sebold's comforting feel-good message of hope to us mortals that when our loved ones die or leave us unexpectedly, they don't disappear forever from our lives but hover above to protect the living like guardian angels. But Sebold doesn't stop there. According to her, the spirits in Heaven hanker to return to planet Earth to experience what's unfinished in their lives and it's that yearning that connects the living with the dead.<br />Sebold takes a horrid subject and turns it into magic, the kind that is seductive and all too willingly embraced by readers. Suzie must be the most cheerful victim of rape and murder in the history of fiction. She's not bitter because she continues to live in the hearts of her family and friends and vice versa. It doesn't hurt that Sebold has lined up a luminous cast of characters to enthral us with. Suzie's father is the big-hearted loving father that anyone could ever wish for. Her mother, more distant and frigid emotionally, hurts more, so goes AWOL in search of herself. Brainy sister Lindsey and cuddly brother Buckley make up the nuclear family, to which is added the charmingly eccentric Grandma Lynn. Ex, coloured boyfriend Ray, oddball girlfriend Ruth, policeman Len, Ruana Singh (Ray's mother) and  Mr Harvey, Suzie's creepy murderer complete the novel's colourful cast. <br />In keeping with its feel-good orientation, LB isn't about exposing the killer and bringing him to justice, so readers needn't fret or feel disappointed that Mr Harvey isn't finally apprehended, handcuffed and marched into prison. Sebold entrusts this to the icy hand of Nature. Instead, Suzie \\"returns\\" to take care ofsome unfinished business of her own, thereby learning to let go. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is an enchanting story, one that will warm the cockles of your heart. <br />Yet I found LB oddly unexceptional. Despite its delightful take on death and the afterlife and some fine characterisation, Sebold's prose is deliberate and forced and frustratingly less than smooth. Her constant references to all-American objects and symbols is also unnecessarily reductive and deeply annoying, which is a great pity. I enjoyed LB well enough, but it's no great shakes.  I don't think it'll find its way anytime soon into the portals of Enduring Literature.	2003-07-22

I'm just grateful it came to my attention because it's a priceless gem and one of the most offhandedly brilliant and enduring works of literature I have read . <br />Omar Razaghi desperately needs to obtain authorisation for the publication of the biography of little known novelist Jules Gund but the executors of the late author's estate won't grant it. He needs to change their mind or his university career is over. Egged on by his American girlfriend Deirdre, Omar hops on board a plane and arrives in Uruguay unannounced to do just that.  Unbeknown to him, his visit would alter the course of his own life and that of the three executors who chose to languish - frozen in time - in a remote residence in Ochos Rios, inaccessible to casual callers and in a state of uneasy mutual coexistence. Omar's effect on the tired chemistry that binds the wife (Caroline), the mistress (Arden) and the brother (Adam) to each other is imperceptible but real and by the time the story draws to a close, the alignments would have changed forever.<br />Apart from its tantalisingly exotic premise, COYFD is distinguished by its gloriously pristine dialogue and absolutely marvellous characterisation. Not many writers are capable of writing dialogue of this quality. It's deceptively easy, but eloquent and true and stays well clear of the mundane. The sparkling dialogue that fills the pages never less than illuminates the souls of its characters, each of whom is vividly drawn and etched in our minds. <br />Omar was tentative, uncertain and confused when he set out for Uruguay. Little did he know that it would lead to a journey of self-discovery that would locate the final resting place for his unsettled soul. All it took was the sting of a honey bee. Deirdre, the pushy, conventional minded American girlfriend, grows increasingly irritating as the plot develops but shows her redeeming qualities in the end. Adam, the aging gay brother, is a genius creation of fiction - never a caricature - and not surprisingly given the novel's sharpest and funniest lines. Caroline has a deep dark secret to hide and is all control and repression. She exudes pure unadulterated negative energy. Arden, on the other hand, isn't quite ready to close the chapter on her life. She is quietly waiting in the wings for someone to extend a hand to yank her back to the land of the living. The careful reader will have observed Cameron's use of differentiating imagery for the two women, dead flowers for Caroline and fresh flowers for Arden. How apt.    <br />Peter Cameron's \\"The City Of Your Final Destination\\" stands tall among other great contemporary novels of today. It is to my mind far superior to many other overpraised titles and deserves a much wider readership than it gets. One of the best novels to have been published in 2002. Highly recommended.	2003-07-17
US	52572105	R15WJF951YOC0H	0670031542	730101042	The Story of Lucy Gault	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Elegiac and distinguished, this is literature at its finest	William Trevor may seem incongruous alongside the other contemporary writers shortlisted for this year's Booker Prize award. Yet his prose - elegiac, graceful and distinguished, infused with an Irish sensibility that is unmistakeably his - retains its old school charm with the power to move and touch readers that makes Trevor an evergreen and a literary giant today. <br />True, I can't see many casual readers hitting the bookstores for \\"The Story Of Lucy Gault (LG)\\". It isn't the stuff that bestsellers are made of. It's a sad, sad story, slow moving with few points of high drama and hardly a plot to speak of. You can have the synopsis in three sentences. The values and sentiments that drive Lucy's decisions are also peculiarly early 20th century and may not be fully appreciated by young readers today. But Trevor never ever hits a false note and if you're looking for literary qualities in a book, you'll find liberal doses of it in LG. <br />The theme of loss, longing, missed opportunity and disappointment that permeates LG is treated by Trevor in the most unsentimental manner. Even deaths in the family are marked by a quiet acceptance that recalls the passing of a season. The politics and religion of Ireland is kept strictly on neutral, reflecting possibly Trevor's own ecumenical position on these matters. Even the unfortunate incident that sparked off the calamitous chain of events results in a fall out on both sides, the Gaults as well as the Horahans. <br />Lucy and young Horahan are finally victims of guilt. Both see the need to atone for their childish acts of petulance or anger and the pain they had unwittingly caused others. Lucy deals with her own guilt by denying herself happiness with Ralph. Poor young Horahan has fewer choices. Haplessly drifting from job to job, he meets his tragic fate in the end. Lucy blames Horahan for her own failed life, yet their communion suggests Lucy's perception that they are united in their matyrdom. Because Trevor's charactershold so much of their feelings in check, the sense of release we experience when they let rip of their emotions is simply devastating, as in Lucy's breakdown scene with her father. Heartbreak at its most shattering. <br />Read \\"The Story Of Lucy Gault\\". This is literature at its finest.	2003-07-04
US	52572105	RS3L93X4N299X	1841953830	456989408	The Cutting Room	Books	5	7	9	N	N	More than a crime novel - a stunning debut	Crime novels seldom qualify as literature because as a genre, crime fiction is said to be manipulative and hence considered a lower written art form. Not so, with Louise Welsh's stunning debut, \\"The Cutting Room (CR)\\". Welsh is undoubtedly a fresh new talent but already she shows such craft, style and maturity in her writing it would be a shame to pigeonhole her as a crime novelist so early in her writing career. She has the stylistic versatility to cross over.<br />As several reviewers have noted on this site, it isn't the plot that makes CR such an impressive and riveting novel. If truth be told, plot is possibly the one weak element in Welsh's story. The premise is certainly fascinating. An aging gay auction house dealer turns investigator after stumbling across possible evidence - from among a rare collection of pornographic books - of a snuff murder being committed in an earlier time. He and his firm needs the money from the job to survive. Before he completes the job, his client dies and he and his boss are tempted to make off with the collection including the evidence but is stopped by an inquisitive and awakening conscience. <br />Rilke is an enthralling anti-hero figure. He is jaded, depraved and dissolute. He cruises bars and parks after work to satisfy his lust for young flesh but his conscience remains alive, buried beneath the stains and ravages of smoke, drugs and drink. Here, Welsh shows her natural talent with characterisation. Rilke's associates and the other lowlife who make up the human landscape are also utterly real and believable. <br />But that's not all. Welsh delves deep into the art auction business and emerges with an authentic and vividly assembled picture of the trade. She's great at scene setting and creating the right atmosphere for her story. What's possibly lacking is a sustained interest in plot development. Often it seems she might have a different bee in her bonnet and this is most evident in the way she engineers the denouement.Suddenly, in a blink of an eye, it's all over. It's as if you sneaked out to the loo and found you missed the ending when you came back. <br />\\"The Cutting Room\\" is nevertheless a formidable debut and one of the most impressive (crime) novels I have ever read. It would be unfairly limiting to consider Welsh simply a budding crime novelist. I think she has potential to produce literature of enduring quality. CR is just the beginning. I'll be looking out for her next. Highly recommended.	2003-06-30
US	52572105	R37PGR6O5XOV9J	0241135796	26357912	Kitchen Venom	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Smug, pretentious and unpleasant, I hated it !	The blurb looked interesting. The author was picked as one of Granta's Best British Novelists and the book won the Somerset Maugham Book Award. So, it should have been more than an even bet that I was on to a winner. Sadly not.<br />\\"Kitchen Venom\\" makes a pretty dreadful read. Philip Hensher offers a particularly cynical and hateful perspective of English parliamentary life. If he is to be believed, it's one great big circus. Nobody does anything of value. The scribes sit around all day gossiping, swapping tales and visiting rent boys in the afternoons. The novel's narrative tone is also deliberately cold and distancing, as if the creatures Hensher writes about aren't worthy of being named. Those he deems worthy of specific identity aren't much better. They're all emotionally deformed. Is John's hump some kind of metaphor ? I wonder. Anyway, John, his daughters Jane and Francesca and fellow clerks Henry and Louis are all hideously repressed. Their external lives are so meaningless they have to invent and act out their fantasies to remind themselves they're alive. There's not a single dialogue between any of these main characters that sounds remotely human or real. Sometimes, mid-chapter, you even get visited by a mysterious first person narrative voice who remains unmasked. Pretentious rubbish. <br />If there's one single stunt Hensher pulls that works, it's the murder scene. The timing of it is so unexpected it leaves the reader in shock. But don't miss the significance of this scene. There's no room in Hensher's world for love and tenderness, only secrecy and lies, so when love rears its head and threatens to blow his cover, there can only be one outcome. Violence and death from a permanently clenched fist. <br />I found much to dislike in \\"Kitchen Venom\\". It's smug, unpleasant and pretentious and I couldn't wait for it to end. Sorry, but I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone.	2003-06-24

The only surprise is that it hasn't - to the best of my knowledge - been optioned for film but if and when that happens, there is no one better to direct the movie than David Lynch, the master of celluloid surrealism. <br />It is hard to tell if Lawrence Miller is living or hallucinating his nightmare existence. After all, he may not be the most reliable of narrators. He is plagued by self-doubt, the result of an emotionally scarring incident involving his step-sister recalled most colourfully and in great style by Lasdun. His wife has left him and he is seeing a shrink. But we take what we read at face value. Then strange things begin to happen and Lawrence thinks he's losing his mind or there's somebody - a disembodied soul perhaps - occupying his office at night or worse spying on him all the time he's working from a little space under his desk. Lasdun cranks up the spook factor by revealing that the previous (day) occupant of his room died under mysterious circumstances and some of her belongings are still left in the room.<br />Lasdun then plants evidence suggesting that our invisible stalker may be a shadowy Bulgarian playwright figure whom we never get to meet. From then on, HM starts to pan out like familiar episodes from \\"Twin Peaks\\". No, there are no dwarfs but Lawrence starts mistaking a strange exotic woman for the shrink he is seeing, getting drawn almost against his will into a totally unreal relationship with a woman attorney, dressing up in his dead ex-colleague's clothes to follow a lead in his investigations, and trading physical blows with a faceless violent presence. As Lawrence's paranoia mounts, we begin to doubt his story. By the time he starts growing horns - as in the book's title - we don't know what to think anymore. <br />Lasdun doesn't offer readers a pat ending. That's why Lynch is the perfect director for a film adaptation of HM. I'm not sure I truly \\"got it\\" but I don't care because maybe I'm not meant to. HM is a real page turner. I was thoroughly entertained every page of the way. Lasdun's prose is crisp, concise, yet suffused with a brooding menace that brought a special intensity to the atmosphere. HM is simply unputdownable. One of the best reads this season.	2003-06-19

Chloe Hooper's debut novel \\"A Child's Book Of True Crime (CBTC)\\" promised much - it was even shortlisted for the Orange Prize - but delivered little. That's because the author couldn't decide what she wanted the novel to be, a stylish murder mystery with an alternative ending and one that cleverly uses the past to mirror the present, or an ode to the nature of violence, a condition inherited from Australia's history as a penal colony. Written in an uncomfortably choppy prose, the novel makes a frustratingly uneven read.<br />As a murder mystery or psychological thriller, CBTC fails on two levels. First, you don't get any resolution to the \\"who murdered Ellie Siddell\\" poser from the past, though luckily you do get to find out whether Kate is letting her own mounting paranoia get to her head or if Veronica is really out to repeat the true crime she is writing about with her rival. But that's not all. Readers will feel doubly cheated when they discover at the end that the Kate/Thomas/Veronica triangle is really a sideshow and that the spotlight of the story is on Lucien. This makes Kate's defiant show of concern for Lucien's welfare as played out in the closing scenes particularly unconvincing and difficult to understand. Up until then, she was only afraid for her own life.<br />CBTC reads much better as an ode to violence as a condition inherited from the past that still haunts the present long after the original settlers have passed on. There is a lurking sense of violence bubbling beneath the surface that runs throughout the novel. Even if the farmer who helped Kate fix her broken car didn't turn out to be a pervert, there is the verbal violence heard spasmodically by Kate in the background to remind us. The psychological violence inflicted by the philandering Thomas and his chilly true crime novelist wife on their son Lucien by treating him not like a nine year old boy but as a \\"short adult\\" is truly horrific. Eventhe storybook animals in the imaginary story are gentler to their own kind and that's the rub.<br />Chloe Hooper was working with great material but she lost it when she couldn't quite decide on the genre she was writing in. CBTC fell between two stools and that's a shame. A courageous but failed experiment.	2003-06-09
US	52572105	R2KTPVP8Y7BEVI	0452283973	838675611	The Impressionist	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A promising debut marred by its poor ending	Hari Kunzru's \\"The Impressionist\\" is one of the most promising debuts to have been published this last year and yes, the novel is excellent, though not nearly as assured or accomplished as the hype would have us believe. The premise of the novel is certainly interesting and an ideal vehicle for Kunzru to explore issues of race, culture and identity in an ironic tongue-in-cheek manner through the life of one half-caste, Pran Nath. From the moment he was conceived, Pran needed only nature's endowment, the instinct to survive. Born into a wealthy Indian family, our pampered hero finds himself unceremoniously dumped into the streets one day when his true paternity comes to light.  Kidnapped by pimps, he is forced into prostitution, servicing a bent colonialist until his incredible escape into the shelter of a half-demented Scottish missionary and his native friendly wife. But that's only half the story. When fate presents the opportunity for a total makeover, the light skinned Pran seizes it, acquiring the false identity of a young Englishman and before we know it, he finds himself \\"back\\" in England living on trust money and the life of an Oxford undergraduate, chasing after an airhead. After many more twists and turns, our young protagonist lands up in Africa. <br />As we witness Pran's multiple transformation, we come face to face with the realization that perhaps, just perhaps there's no real person underneath the skin and bone. Watching this beautiful butterfly morph into a moth and back again is like watching a snake shedding its skin, an ongoing process powered by nature and instinct. While \\"The Impressionist\\" is undoubtedly an impressive and intriguing novel, Kunzru may have overreached himself and the minisaga pays the price of being overwritten. In my opinion, the author seems to have bitten off more than he can chew. Apart from his tendency towards bombastic vocabulary and his occasionally awkward sentence construction, the novel also suffers from eclectic characterisation and a slightly unsteady tone. The madcap resolution in the forest between the Nawab's retinue and the colonialists dissolves into camp and farce, like a scene from \\"A Midsummers Night Dream\\". Major Privett-Clamp and his wife Charlie are cartoon characters to laugh at. The MacFarlanes are eccentrics, though I suspect I've met the demented missionary before in Matthew Kneale's \\"English Passengers\\". Star, the heartless bimbo and object of Pran's desire, is clearly the English cousin of Daisy Buchanan (from Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\") from across the Atlantic. But most disappointing of all are the final chapters in Africa. Turgidly written, obscure and confusing, they are a terrible letdown. <br />That said, don't let the overhype surrounding \\"The Impressionist\\" put you off. It may not be the realised masterpiece critics claim it is, but it is definitely worth your time reading it. Despite its poor ending, I enjoyed it immensely.	2003-06-06

This year's winner, \\"Three Junes\\", a three-part novel held together by a couple of casual common character threads, isn't a million miles from the subject of last year's winner (Jonathan Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\"). Both make the event of homecoming -  a parents' funeral in \\"Three Junes\\" and Christmas in \\"The Corrections\\" - the flashpoint for the subtle outbreak of sibling hostilities and the restoration of calm via an uneasy truce that comes with the recognition that family love binds us all.<br />\\"Three Junes\\" is a linearly constructed three novella whose centre and emotional core lies clearly in the middle story. Nevertheless, the opening vignette about the recently widowered father's escape to Greece to deal with his bereavement is both poignant and heartbreaking in conveying the deep sense of longing experienced by Paul McLeod for the missing intimacy with his late wife, Maureen, an independent and feisty woman whose life seemed to have been tied up more with her beloved collies than with her family. In his travels, Paul strikes up a casual acquaintance with a young woman, Fern, who will be written out of the script only to make a mysterious reappearance as the central character in the concluding episode of \\"Three Junes\\".<br />In the middle and most substantial story, Paul's three grown up sons, Fenno, and twins David and Dennis and their wives Lilian and Veronique, return home for their father's funeral. At the same time, another story emerges in parallel, that of an earlier homecoming when the boys visit the family home to spend time with their dying mother and to subsequently attend to her funeral. It pans out that nothing is quite what they seem on the surface. The cerebral and intellectual Fenno is most like Dad but sides with Mum. Subconsciously, he admires her fiercely independent streak. Who can blame him, when he has the privacy of his secret gay lifestyle in New York to protect ?  Music critic and bosom pal, Mal, is mistaken by the family for Fenno's lover while secret lover Tony remains invisible to all but Fenno. The ever pragmatic David - his mother's son - thinks he knows something from the past about Mum that may haunt them.....but does he, really ? As it turns out, his life isn't nearly as perfect as it seems. Even Veronique, Dennis' French wife, shows she isn't quite the shrew we all came to expect. Ultimately, the McLeods don't let the half-truths, secrets and lies that permeate their lives to destroy them. They overcome the odds to show each other the meaning of love. It is in this middle story that Glass impresses most with her strong characterisation and her gorgeously written and luminous prose that speaks straight to the heart. If she had ended with this middle story, \\"Three Junes\\" would have been an unconditional triumph. <br />Sadly, she didn't and lost her way in the concluding episode, which feels dramatically out of place, flat, and unsatisfying. Why would anyone be interested in Fern so late in the day ? She is after all a long forgotten minor character from the opening story. Had Glass stayed with Fenno, she would have had a more convincing wrap up.<br />\\"Three Junes\\" is a flawed but smashing debut from Julia Glass. It is gorgeously written, emotionally resonant and one of the most delightful reads this season. Highly recommended.	2003-05-29
US	52572105	R25GLBTAKX5OPA	1573229725	595147475	Fingersmith	Books	5	36	39	N	N	Pure storytelling of the highest order !	Sarah Waters' third novel \\"Fingersmith\\" is both a critical and popular favourite. It has been shortlisted for several book awards including the Booker Prize. Waters herself has attracted much attention from literary circles since the publication of her first two novels \\"Tipping The Velvet\\" and \\"Affinity\\", both of which have won her many accolades. The former has even been made into a TV movie by the BBC. So what's the fuss about ? I'd say it's down to the fact that Waters has created a niche for herself writing fiction the way the old masters used to. Her style cannot be further away from the rabid excesses of many contemporary writers who try to pass off bad for inventive writing. Waters' eloquent and long flowing sentences recall the style of classical writers like Charles Dickens. Her craft lies in pure storytelling - about petty criminals, thiefs, pickpockets, damsels in distress, etc all in a Victorian setting - but with a strong dash of the new feminist sensibility that brings her story bang up-to-date.....and it works !<br />\\"Fingersmith\\" at more than 500 pages long may be overwritten but it is superbly crafted and a truly compelling read. Sure, there's drama, mystery, suspense and great characterisation but it isn't the fearsome mindbender the blurbs make it out to be. After you have recovered from the jaw dropping shock that Waters has laid in store for you at the close of the first segment, the other twists and turns that ensue aren't that difficult to follow. In fact, they're fairly predictable but that's a compliment, not a criticism, because it shows Waters cares more about her story's integrity than delivering cheap shocks. By the time you get to the end of it, our heroines, Sue and Maud, must seem like two peas in a pod or spiritual twins from opposite sides of the track.

US	52572105	R3HCL41RVQC93S	0007141076	958226210	Unless: A Novel	Books	5	17	21	N	N	Full of the brooding intimacy of female contemplation	Women novelists dominate a genre in fiction that attract mostly female readers.  These writers specialise in stories about ordinary lives. Burrowing deep into the psyche of people who live normal unexceptional lives, these stories typically explore the interiors of our human existence for dark troubled spots that lie just beneath the surface, waiting to explode and when they do, the fallout is undoubtedly damaging though seldom sensational. Anita Brookner is one such writer. Carol Shields is another. If you're male and don't consider yourself the sensitive type, chances are that you're not going to enjoy such books. Unless you read for the pleasure of language and derive adequate compensation from oodles of tremulously and articulately written prose.<br />&quot;Unless&quot;, Carol Shields' latest and possibly last novel, is as the titled preposition suggests. It's one long drawn out pause, during which our heroine Reta Winters strikes a pose as she ponders over the myriad details of her life and in the process questions their significance. She ruminates over her accidental career transition from translator of memoirs to light fiction novelist, the routine itinerary of her book tours, her regular morning coffee gathering with fellow feminists and friends, visits to the neighbourhood library, her complacent yet unconscious relationship with her husband Tom and three teenage daughters, Norah, Christine and Natalie, etc. <br />Reta's bout of self examination is sparked off by Norah's sudden abandonment of home and college to sit by the roadside begging with a signboard that says &quot;goodness&quot; hung around her neck. Was she somehow responsible for Norah's inexplicable act of surrender ? Did she cause Norah to despair at such a tender age of ever leading a life of significance ? As Reta's internal dialogue runs its course and the story draws to a close, she learns a few things about herself and about the possibilities of life. Despite her new male editor's pushiness, she shows she can still after all stand her ground and maintain creative control over the second light fiction novel she is writing. On the other hand, Reta's self absorption makes her blind to the loneliness of her mother-in-law whom she thinks is congenitally silent until she learns that the old lady opened up to a complete stranger one evening when the family was away from home. <br />The mystery behind Norah's sudden turn is revealed in the last chapter. I won't say what it is so as not to spoil it for readers. While sufficiently explanatory, it is also not entirely satisfying. It lets Reta off the hook somewhat but it did bring her self awareness if nothing else.<br />&quot;Unless&quot; has been highly praised by critics. It was shortlisted for the Booker and appears on the Orange Prize longlist.  While by no means a spectacular piece of work,  Shields' trademark qualities are stamped all over it. Beautifully articulate and well written, &quot;Unless&quot; will appeal to readers who love the brooding intimacy of female contemplation.	2003-04-17
US	52572105	R2X0C33PCEKA25	0375706852	127846038	My Name Is Red	Books	5	18	20	N	N	"My Name Is Red" is a modern masterpiece !	It is tempting to compare \\"My Name Is Red (MNIR)\\" with Umberto Eco's \\"The Name Of The Rose\\" but that would be to deny Orhan Pamuk's masterpiece its own beauty and originality. Pamuk's technique of using a rotating cast of narrators not only adds to the intrigue of the murder mystery but facilitates the juxtaposition of the conflicting opinions that emerged in Turkish society at a time when foreign influences were slowly but surely creeping into the arts and craft of its traditional civilisation. While the whodunnit element remains undoubtedly the driving force behind the narrative, readers are likely to derive their biggest payoff from their appreciation of the Islamic philosophy towards the arts, the painting of still and natural life, and of how and why it is an abomination against God for any artist to develop his own style or paint a lifelike portrait of any human being. In depicting the duplicity of its characters, the novel also pierces the facade of a closed and repressive order. <br />MNIS is a monumental piece of work that has to be read to be believed. Written and translated into a prose that's accessible, vivid and rich with poetic imagery, I believe MNIR will one day sit alongside other modern masterpieces of the century. Highly, highly recommended.	2003-04-08
US	52572105	R3ENWR21RQSXEQ	0312252803	493018762	The Country Life: A Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	N	An elegant novel that's full of poignance, wit and humour !	Rachel Cusk has been shortlisted as one of England's new generation of great novelists. Writing in the tradition of  Jane Austen, Cusk has the ability to transform a small range novel into a modern comedy of manners that will appeal to readers who love good old fashioned writing, a lost art it seems with many of today's contemporary novelists who confuse bad for inventive writing. She writes in long flowing sentences and the result is a very literate prose that flows with an easy elegance, making \\"A Country Life\\" a truly enchanting reading experience.<br />The ordeal that Stella Benson endures as an au pair to the Maddens is as much due to the eccentricity of her employers as to her own mixed up emotional state after hastily deciding to abandon city life for the country and severing all ties with her family. Her transformation in 24 hours from big time city solicitor to lowly hired help in the country is fraught with uncertainties for our Stella. Unprepared for the quaint habits and scorching sun of country life, Stella stumbles from one awkward situation to another but survives the humiliation with stoicism and good humour. Quite plainly, the Maddens inhabit a world of  their own. They live in a different planet from city folks. Even the ground keeper and the creature-like shopkeeper behave strangely.  Piers and Pamela and their grown up children are characters straight out of Evelyn Waugh's England. Pamela is falsely genteel and patronising in her treatment of Stella but since it is born of insularity and ignorance rather than rudeness or plain bad manners, she deserves our pity.  Caroline and Toby are spoilt privileged types and rather unattractive characters. Only the physically handicapped Martin has the playful wickedness to make Stella confront some home truths about herself.<br />There are vague hints of deep dark family secrets, adulteries and even incest throughout but thankfully none of these prove to be fertile leads. To her credit, Cusk remains focussed, never losing sight of the point of her novel but at the risk of disappointing readers who expect something darker to develop. I like it as it is. \\"A Country Life\\" is something of a minor masterpiece that is delivered with an abundance of poignance, wit and humour. I'll be reading a lot more of Cusk in the future, that's for sure.	2003-04-02

Michael Frayn's &quot;Spies&quot;, the 2002 Whitbread Prize winner, is a quintessentially English novel that recalls L P Hartley's classic &quot;The Go Between&quot;. Both novels begin with an old man indulging in the queasily pleasurable habit of visiting the past when as a young boy he was innocent of the tragedy his childish detective games would set in motion for the adults and end with a stark recognition that resonates with an indescribable pain we feel for the ruined lives they have caused. The rush of familiar smells and the recollection of other childish secrets like a misspelled password trigger off a flood of memories for the adult Stephen Wheatley. These in turn become the catalyst for unravelling the secrets that underlie the mystery that consumed the boy Stephen and his playmate Keith one fateful summer.<br />Frayn flits skilfully between past to present but when we enter the world of the boy Stephen, we become child observers too. We don't have a head start in our understanding of what is happening among the adults because our senses are his. Even Keith's mother - like all mothers - doesn't have a name. The suspicious routines that preoccupy Keith's mother - her constant shuttling between home and her sister's or the post office, and her mysterious disappearance from sight every time she turns the corner  - is shrouded in a mystery that deepens with vague hints of cruelty and abuse that only the adult Stephen is able to discern. Indeed, the relationship between Stephen and Keith is hardly a friendship, more an emblem of their class differences, which allow the middle class Keith to play leader to the socially inferior Stephen. In the same way, Keith's parents exude a distance and coolness that is slightly unnerving.<br />Frayn's characterisation is flawless. His characters are all vividly drawn personalities that leap out of the pages at you. Stephen's torment and debilitating lack of confidence as a socially underprivileged child is especially resonant and a masterpiece of characterisation. Then there's Keith's mother. Her icy elegance and well groomed exterior conceals the desperate and terrible turmoil beneath it. Keith's father, constantly at work in his home garage, is a lurking and quietly menacing presence. Then there's Keith. His haughty silence and his cruel smirk, duplicating his father's, is a precursor for when he draws blood. Finally, there's Barbara. Her precocious spitefulness makes her every pre-teen boy's nightmare big sister. <br />&quot;Spies&quot; is a delicious psychologically thriller that fans of the English novel will delight in. It is beautifully written and a real page turner. You will find your pulse racing as the story approaches its climax.  But Frayn eschews an explicit revelation, so you might have to read the last chapter carefully (if not twice) to get it.  Sadly though, he decides to wrap with a contrived shock revelation about Stephen's own family history that is unnecessary and brings the story to an end on a false note. &quot;Spies&quot; is otherwise an excellent and ingeniously crafted little novel that deserves to be read and enjoyed widely. I'm glad it won the Whitbread.	2003-03-25
US	52572105	R2YSA7RJVIFOS4	0142001422	804365556	The Pickup	Books	5	12	15	N	N	Powerful and deeply resonant....possibly Gordimer's best	\\"The Pickup (PU)\\" may be Nadine Gordimer's best novel to date. Her observations about social and cultural conflict and the universal truths revealed in her latest is proof indeed that, despite her well entrenched reputation as an African novelist, Gordimer's aim is lofty and wide and the result is that she has successfully avoided being cast in the limiting mould of an ethnic writer. <br />PU doesn't necessarily make easy reading. Gordimer's prose is terse, occasionally difficult, and distancing. Her perspectives often shift from Julie to Abdu and back again without any warning, so you may find yourself stranded in mid air - like a deer caught in the headlights - but the discomfort is only temporary because you quickly find your feet and recover. The style that Gordimer has chosen to write in isn't alienating but curiously congruous within the context of the social and cultural issues she surfaces in this tale with an otherwise well worn premise of a white girl picking up a black boy and paying the price of her socially disgraceful act.<br />Julie Summers is a white girl from a privileged background in South Africa. She despises her father's life of business, privilege and distinction, choosing to spend her time hanging out with her other liberal minded friends at the \\"EL-AY Café Table\\", where they congregate daily to [complain] about social injustices, etc. Abdu is an illegal immigrant, working long hours like a \\"grease monkey\\" in a run down garage and desperate to make a living in his newly (albeit illegally) adopted home. Julie picks Abdu up after a chance meeting. They become lovers and when Abdu gets deported, Julie decides to marry him and they return to his natural home, an unnamed country in Africa. <br />The internal conflicts and struggles in their relationship before and after leaving South Africa arise from their contrasting backgrounds and the unspoken cultural baggage that accompany them. To Julie, dignity is about principles - she baulks at crawlingback to Daddy for help. For Abdu, it is about survival and building a better life for himself, so he finds Julie's attitude genuinely puzzling. Julie gives scarcely a thought to the meaning of \\"home\\" for she always had one. For Abdu, his natural home is a hell hole from which he must escape to find another that allows him to fulfil his potential. Then there are Julie's friends at the Table. What do they really know and what do they stand for ? Is their all talk and no action simply a pastime for privileged white youths ? <br />When the second half of the story moves permanently to black Africa, we sense the subtle changes creeping into the relationship between Julie and Abdu, who becomes Ibrahim, his real name. Here, Gordimer shows great intuition judging their behaviourial shifts as they make the transition. In his own habitat, Abdu becomes even more silent, concentrated and tunnel visioned. Julie's quiet acceptance of her new family's ways shows a genuine attempt to blend in and is both touching and real. Still an outsider, Julie seeks solace in her visits to the \\"desert at the end of the road\\" - her secret place - where she recoups her resources and regains her sense of balance and perspective. Like us perhaps, Abdu waits for Julie to crack up and reveal her true mettle as one of the boys at the Table. But Gordimer has other ideas and the ending she has devised contains a jaw dropping twist nobody will foresee. It is the novelist's expression of eternal surprise and compassion that encapsulates the human spirit. A beautiful ending. \\"The Pickup\\" resonates with a power and optimism that makes this one of the most compelling and deeply satisfying novels I have read. I'm surprised it didn't make it beyond the 2001 Booker Prize longlist. In my opinion, it's more substantial than and far surpasses some which made the shortlist.	2003-03-11
US	52572105	R2Q4V82A5BNIE5	0151008116	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A delightful novel to be enjoyed by readers of all ages	The selection of Yann Martel's \\"Life Of Pi (LOP)\\" as 2002's Booker Prize is an unusual choice but it comes like a breath of fresh air. It's hard to say what it is. At the most basic level, it is an epic adventure story about an incredible shipwreck and the struggle for survival on the high seas by a motley crew consisting of one human being - our hero Pi - and the most unlikely assortment of animals (from his family's zoo in Pondicherry) you can possibly imagine. Yet it has all the elements of a fable. The simplicity and directness of Martel's language masks the duality and complexity of his insights into the human condition. Are human beings so very different from animals, he seems to ask ? Probably not, as you will conclude watching Pi's relentless bid to outwit and establish supremacy over Richard Parker, the Bengali tiger he's left alone with on the life boat in the Pacific Oceans. Even Pi discovers a few surprises about himself. His courage in the face of adversity is simply awesome and gives faith to us all. Conversely and in a beautifully lyrical passage, Martel tells us that the underwater world of sea creatures - big and small - too has its own traffic system that rivals ours. How's that !<br />LOP also says something about the place of faith and religion in human society. Did it help Pi survive his ordeal ? Ecumenical to a fault - he bows to the gods of Christianity, Islam and Hinduism in random order - he buys insurance from across all religions to cover the risks and by and large succeeds and reaps his rewards. However, Martel's take on religion is perhaps the weakest and least convincing aspect of his novel. He plants the seeds but doesn't water them, so they don't flower. His ideas on religion remain tentative and undeveloped.<br />As if conscious of this lack of closure, Martel engineers a twist at the end of the story that should leave readers scratching their heads in wonder. Have they been taken for a ride ? Should they cry cheat after it is revealed that Pi's account of his adventure on the high seas may be less than reliable ? I don't really know. But read the ending carefully. Herein lies Martel's message. I hear him asking \\"Is anything less than true only because it falls outside the realms of belief ?\\"  \\"Does something become more true only because it is witnessed and corroborated ?\\" <br />But let's not get too intellectual pondering these questions. Read \\"Life Of Pi\\" any way you like. Just remember to enjoy it. \\"Life Of Pi\\" is a treasure that will appeal to readers young and old. An absolutely delightful novel. Unique.	2003-02-24
US	52572105	R2FXKPJKZGTA7Z	0385722109	660348741	Hotel World	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Experimental, inventive but overly hyped	Ali Smith's \\"Hotel World\\" is hardly a novel. More like five vignettes held together by the most tenuous of links - a common locale, the Global Hotel, where the stories take place, a perfect excuse for the use of five disembodied voices as narrators. There's the ghost of young national swimmer Sara Wilby, the chambermaid who paid for the fun of a prank with her life, her grieving sister Claire, regular bag lady Else from across the road who gets to be a non-paying guest for the night courtesy of the kindhearted receptionist Lise, and Penny, the glamourous visiting journalist. Smith's writing style is consciously experimental, almost deliberately inventive and varied, so it shouldn't surprise that some of her stories work better than others. Sort of a hit or miss. <br />The opening chapter, Sara's ghostly confessional, is an absolute delight. Full of playful regret and poignance, it expresses articulately poor Sara's shock at being consigned in a few seconds to the other side of existence. So much so that she keeps going over and reminiscing on every little detail of living. Lise's story is also strangely moving because we can all relate to it. Her ambivalent act of kindness is every minion's secret dream. Of cocking a snook at management as a therapeutic release from one's sense of powerlessness. Claire's stream-of-consciousness rambling is rich in content but frustratingly difficult to access. Unless you've had plenty of practice with Virginia Woolf novels. Penny's adventure on the corridors outside her room is surrealistic and reads like a spooky episode from \\"Twin Peaks\\". But it isn't quite up to the mark. Else's story is unexceptional and the closing chapter with references to the spirit of national icons like Princess Diana and the late 60s pop diva Dusty Springfield just seems like a lame attempt by Smith to gain a more general validity for her novel. Stylistically, what gives \\"Hotel World\\" a coherence is Smith's use of repeat themes and objects throughout herstories. Like that of \\"falling\\" (Sara's flight down the chute.....and the strange girl outside Penny's corridor peering into the void behind the wall) and the \\"watches\\" and \\"time\\" motif , etc. <br />Ali Smith's \\"Hotel World\\" is an interesting experiment and typical of the works of young contemporary writers from England. She is a name to watch but it's early days yet. \\"Hotel World\\" is ultimately more hype than substance...and by far the weakest and the most lightweight of the Booker Prize nominees of 2001. Smith has to pay her dues to land the big one !	2003-02-18
US	52572105	RRJ64WMK4XMFK	0375702784	877422050	Original Bliss	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A stark, edgy and arresting piece of work by Kennedy	A L Kennedy is regarded as one of today's most promising young writers. Her writing, her way with words, is decidedly contemporary, modernist and may not appeal to readers bred on novels styled the old school way. Kennedy favours the intensely emotional, the dysfunctional and the unmentionable for her subjects. She also believes in the value of shocks, which she delivers with the use of brutally strong language. But you're not offended because it somehow feels right. The honesty and nakedness of the emotions she writes about is made all the more real by the starkness of its expression. <br />\\"Original Bliss (OB)\\" is about how two unspeakably damaged souls find solace and healing in each other. Helen Brindle, the battered housewife, is too numb to feel pain anymore. She has lost her life force, her line of communication with God and makes a desperate connection with cybernetics expert Edward Gluck after she sees him on TV. Unbenown to Helen, her would-be saviour is in a private hell of his own. He loses himself completely in his intellectual pursuit to forget he can't feel and finds unrelenting relief in pornography. Their first unhopeful meeting at a conference in Stuttgart leads to a relationship which can't be adequately described or pidegeonholed as an affair because that would be too limiting. Their relationship is both tentative and desperate. Like two wounded animals touching each other as a prelude to rediscovering their own beating hearts. Kennedy's prose is choppy, claustrophobic and suffocating but how else should it be if we're to understand Helen's and Edward's predicament ? We also mustn't forget Mr Brindle, Helen's abusive husband. He's a monster and inexcusable even if he doesn't know it himself. <br />OB isn't exactly an easy or pleasant read. It's edgy and awkward in parts. The words - especially the dialogue - don't flow. They stutter and jerk because our two protagonists are only just learning to articulate. The words they speak form snatches of broken sentences because they're as much directed to themselves as to each other. Nonetheless, OB is an impressive and arresting piece of work. Kennedy is clearly an original talent and one whom we will surely hear alot from in the future.	2003-02-14

In less than 150 pages, McEwan gives meaning to the concept of \\"evil\\", the indescribable and unutterable sense of horror we recognise but often cannot articulate. <br />Here, June Tremain's shattering encounter with evil while taking a walk in the French countryside one day drives a permanent wedge between her and her newly wed husband Bernard and radically alters her world view of life.  Quite inexplicably, she abandons her life's work with Bernard, renounces her membership of the British Communist Party, and withdraws into a life of solitude, quiet reflection and contemplative mysticism. Her betrayal of the cause on which they built their marriage baffles and embitters Bernard. He came close but because he never shared his wife's experience, he is left stranded across the philosophical divide. Was it chance or fate that chose June (and not Bernard) ?  Perhaps it was June's more gentle nature that made her vulnerable. We may never know but their contrasting reaction to the butterfly that visited them at the railway station leaves a clue. <br />It is left to Jeremy, the Tremains' son-in-law, to uncover the truth. The preface explains Jeremy's parent fixation and his undertaking to write June's memoirs. But Jeremy is also the perfect literary devise to peel away the layers that shroud the mystery and tell the story backwards. Again, McEwan shows why he is the reigning Master of the Sinister genre. I could feel the hairs at the back of my neck grow erect as the brooding menace intensified with each chapter. Every human encounter, whether with Jeremy and Bernard as they jostle with the crowds to watch the Wall come down in Berlin, or Jeremy alone with strangers in a countryside motel, is stalked by a latent violence just waiting to erupt. Jeremy's close shave with the king spider one night in an empty cottage hauntingly foreshadows the revelation of June's frightening encounter with the \\"black dogs\\", which McEwan adroitly leaves to the last while leaving the reader with a last gasp of horror when the truth behind the canine predators are revealed.<br />In its depiction of evil, \\"Black Dogs\\" recalls \\"The Comfort Of Strangers (COS)\\" but it is a superior work in conception and execution.  It is a hidden gem and a McEwan classic that deserves wider recognition and is destined for a long shelf life. Spread the word around. Go read it !	2003-02-05
US	52572105	R2JBA5ECVLW4TU	0786709820	50158188	According to Queeney: A Novel (Bainbridge, Beryl)	Books	5	1	4	N	N	Esoteric subject brought to life by the talented Bainbridge	\\"According To Queeney (ATQ)\\", Beryl Bainbridge's historical fictional account of the last 20 years of Samuel Johnson's life, will appeal especially to readers who have some background of the subject but it won't shut out the rest of us who don't. Although Bainbridge parades her huge supporting cast of characters to readers with scarcely an introduction as if we're on first name terms with them, it doesn't take long for us to catch up...and we make the effort because after a slow start, we're intrigued as we read on. Bainbridge's disciplined, economical yet eloquent prose stimulates our curiousity and brings to life a subject the non-literary minded may justifiably consider esoteric. <br />ATQ doesn't seek to compete with Boswell's biographical masterpiece because it is fiction. What Bainbridge offers is a personal and intimate profile - warts and all - of a great lexicographer and an eminent man of letters who in his twilight years has become a sickly, strange tempered and eccentric old man. This profile is developed from his imagined life as a permanent house guest of Southwark brewer, Henry Thrale and his wife, Hester on whose emotional support he grows increasingly to rely. Through the eyes of young Queeney, the Thrales' eldest daughter, we observe the lifestyle of Johnson and the Thrales, how they behave, the fellow artistes they consort with and their meticulously organised travels to Europe. More interestingly, we detect the development of a curious relationship between the crotchety Johnson and his hostess, the unhappy and shallow Hester. Not quite \\"the story of unrequited love \\" suggested by critics, it is nevertheless a relationship founded upon mutual need and one that isn't in the least obvious or easy to discern. That it should end the way it did doesn't surprise. The story is also littered with incidents of spite, bitterness and petty jealousies among the servants in Johnson's own household as they compete for their master's affection. There is ironically a subplot of \\"unrequited love\\" in the story but not where you expect to find it. Queeney's voice is sour and reluctant throughout. She was a precocious child - that's why Johnson was so fond of her and became her Latin tutor - but the sentiment isn't especially reciprocated. Her letters as an adult to various Johnson researchers seeking corroboration and evidence reveal a less than enthusiastic friend, if ever she was one. What does that tell you about Johnson's success as an individual ? <br />ATQ is a quietly confident historical novel of Johnson's erratic life that will appeal to the literary minded, afficionados as well as those who simply love good writing. Bainbridge must be the most often shortlisted fictional author - ever - for the Booker Prize. She's earned her dues and played bridesmaid long enough. Let's hope she wins it some day. ATQ didn't make it beyond the longlist. More's the pity because so few contemporary writers today possess Bainbridge's virtues. With her, less is more.	2003-01-27

Robinson isn't a flashy or gimmicky writer. He doesn't have to be because he's got craft. He knows how to tell a good story, work up the suspense and keep you turning the pages until you run out of them. His characters are well developed, rounded and believable personalities you care about. Inspector Alan Banks will become a household name if he isn't one already. The interplay between Banks' tentative romance with DS Annie Cabbot and the uncovering of the truth behind the murder that took place at Hobb's End during the post-war years adds immeasurably to the poignance of the story. There are no real startling truths waiting to be unlocked from the closet. The revelations are almost predictable - we guess correctly at Vivien Elmsy's identity early on - but we never feel cheated, let down or disappointed because the plotting, the intrigue, the suspense and the characterisation are so exquisitely executed you judge the entity by the quality of the reading experience which for me couldn't be better. An excellent murder mystery. Highly recommended.	2003-01-20

It is nevertheless a wickedly clever black comedy depicting the heartlessness and moral bankruptcy at the core of a society that thinks nothing of playing \\"God\\" with our own lives and that of others, or even resorting to murder to remove any obstacles that may lie in our paths to personal glory. There isn't a single moral character in \\"Amsterdam\\". Neither Clive (music composer), nor Vernon (editor), nor Julian (Foreign Secretary), nor George (publisher). Even the promiscuous Molly Lane has a better score card than her ex-lovers only because she is dead. Molly is invisible except in their dreams but her eyes are the lens through which we observe their acts of ruthless scheming. Clive may be outraged by Vernon's betrayal of Molly's memory but he is no better when he doesn't bother to report a crime he may have witnessed while lost in thought over the construction of his millennium anthem. McEwan's acerbic wit and razor sharp gift with language shines throughout, even as he takes us on an excursion into Clive's mind as he muses over the melody and movement-in-progress of his would-be masterpiece. Needless to say, the denouement McEwan has engineered for us renders more than a touch of poetic justice to our two ugly protagonists. A little sick perhaps, or even hyperbolic but then again, it's also quintessentially McEwan and he's brought us to darker places before.<br />I enjoyed \\"Amsterdam\\" very much. It is brilliantly crafted, inspired even in parts, but one can't help the feeling that it was a consolation Booker Prize that McEwan won for his earlier works. \\"Atonement\\", his latest, is a far more complex and accomplished novel but it lost to Peter Carey's \\"True Story Of The Kelly Gang\\"....but then again, the book awards - like the Academy Awards - are sometimes more about politics than merit and that's amurky area we don't want to get into. Suffice to say that \\"Amsterdam\\" is an excellent novel that McEwan fans will most definitely enjoy. It may even win over new fans.	2003-01-15

None of that sci-fi or futuristic stuff for me. It's a big book but don't be intimated by it. Sure, Banks takes his time setting the scene and you may get a little impatient or lost making out who's who and getting the chronology of events into perspective - Banks does get carried away toggling between past and present in the first third of the novel - but persevere 'cos when the story finally gets going and builds into a dramatic climax, it becomes a real page turner and by then, you're hooked and can't wait to find out how it'll end. <br />The McHoans and the Urvills are an extended Scottish family. They are highly eccentric and of all persuasions - atheists, religious, environmentalists, etc. You name them, you'll find them. Throw them together and you have an explosive cocktail of types. Banks also introduces the perenniel class divide, with the working class Watts on one side and the moneyed Urvills on the other. How their paths cross is the one surprise element that will propel the story towards its own dramatic conclusion. Meanwhile, poor, confused young Prentice, the novel's protagonist, isn't coping too well with his love life. He falls in lust with the lovely Verity when his heart belongs to another. As soon as Prentice cottons on to the sinister happenings within his family - a mysterious disappearance, untimely deaths, etc - the tempo of CR changes, the narrative acquires more focus - no more going backwards and forwards in time - and we're onto a thriller that builds relentless into a climax. <br />CR is a sleeper. A little too loose and sprawling perhaps at the beginning, but is quickly transformed into a heady thriller with a heart when Banks starts to focus and everything else falls into place. A marvelous novel, I enjoyed it very much.	2003-01-09

They may be right. In my humble opinion, it should have beaten Peter Carey's more showy \\"True Story of the Kelly Gang\\" for the 2001 Booker Prize. \\"Atonement\\" is about how a young girl innocently ruins the lives of two people she cares about and spends the rest of her adult life atoning for her crime. Did aspiring playwright Briony let her fertile imagination run wild after witnessing scenes she barely understood ? Did she jump tragically to the wrong conclusion or was there something subterranean at work that we or even she didn't realise at the time ? <br />The novel breaks neatly into three parts. The first and arguably finest part is so expertly constructed it knocks practically everything else that follows - barring the epilogue - into the shade. In typical McEwan fashion, we are spared long intros common to writers who indulge in elaborate scene setting. We cut straight to that fateful summer in 1934. The action begins after the extended family has assembled in the Tallis' home and at once there is a brooding tension that perfectly anticipates the tragedy that follows. Here, McEwan shows his mastery of suspense by going over the same happenings through different eyes. <br />The middle section deals with the aftermath of the crime. The torrid war scenes poignantly heightens the bitterness experienced by Cecilia and Robbie of their broken lives. This section also provides a natural bridge to the final part where we see the adult Briony working tirelessly as a nurse in a hospital attending to the sick and wounded. Will the physical punishment she puts herself through atone for her crime ? How does she seek forgiveness from the aggrieved when the past cannot be rewritten and when she was only doing what she thought was right ? As usual, McEwan has left his best shot for the last. The ace secretly tucked up his sleeve is revealed in the concluding chapter when the 77-year old Briony makes peace with herself and those she has hurt by using that same imagination she was blessed (or cursed) with. What an ingenius resolution....but then again, it's only McEwan spinning his magic.<br />Ian McEwan is unquestionably the pre-eminent contemporary novelist of our time. He gets better and better with each effort and with \\"Atonement\\" he may have reached his peak. A literary masterpiece. I have every incentive to mine his entire back catalogue for the enjoyment it will provide.	2003-01-02

That said, it's only natural to make some comparisons since they are both medieval tales set in the times of the infamous Spanish Inquisition. Whereas Eco's genre-defining tour de force is brilliantly complex in its plotting and treatment of the subject, Kalogridis' tale of persecution is more personal, less ambitious in its scope but no less enjoyable.<br />As a reader unschooled in medieval European history, I was intrigued by BT's focus on the practice of the old (ie, pre-Christian) religion and how this became an underground religion for many who masquaraded as Christians but continued to practise in secret in the medieval days. The novel is also instructive in demonstrating how horribly intolerant \\"new\\" religions invariably are before they take root and how ecumenical they become when they are established, become secular or the accepted religion of the day. <br />BT unfolds in a sequence of flashbacks as Sybille, the Mother Abbess held captive by the Church and awaiting death at the stake, confesses her story to young trainee monk, Brother Michel. While there's nothing in the plot development that surprises, the suspense never lets up until you reach the final page. Kalogridis knows how to tell a gripping tale. The only false note I detected was in the depiction of Michel's lust for Sybille, a concession to young readers raised on a diet of sex and sin. A bit of a cheap shot. Kalogridis should have trusted herself more.<br />BT is an absorbing, enjoyable and a very well written novel. I highly recommend it.	2002-12-19

I love Ruth rendall's writing, so I'm already partial but despite glowing reviews from both critics and readers, I found \\"A Sight For Sore Eyes (ASFSE)\\" to be a major disappointment. ASFSE isn't a conventional murder mystery but that's not the problem. It's about damaged people and how tragedy is unavoidable if their paths cross and they're left to their own devises. The story is so full of weirdos or people of stunted development you wonder it isn't set in an insane asylum. Francine's stepmother, Julia, is so hysterical and over-the-top the whole thing feels like a circus. <br />Somehow, there's an air of artificiality about ASFSE, from its storyline to its characters, from Rendall's prose to her method of telling. Because it's contrived, the reader is also distanced and cannot believe what he's reading, let alone feel for the characters. Kate Grenville's \\"Dark Places\\" had the same effect on me. Even the clever ending - a stroke of inspiration on Rendall's part - couldn't stop the novel from degenerating into a freak show. The reader is ultimately cheated of a genuine sense of horror because the story unfolds like a bad joke. <br />Sorry, I beg to disagree but ASFSE falls far short of Rendall's usual high standards. A major disappointment.	2002-12-16
US	52572105	R6P67WSYMVHBN	0449006972	71254966	Gertrude and Claudius: A Novel	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Updike infused with the Bard's spirit : gorgeous	No student of \\"Hamlet\\" will fail to be impressed by John Updike's imaginary prequel to the Bard's famous play about the moody Danish prince. A few pages into this enchanting little novel and I was in awe, captivated, struck, and rendered speechless by the magical power of Updike's language - hey, it seemed like the author was inspired if not infused with the spirit of the Bard when he penned \\"Gertrude and Claudius (G & C)\\". There is a mesmerising beauty and sensuality to Updike's prose that has to be savoured for its full meaning to be appreciated in all its nuances. It is colourful, vivid, shimmering, passionate, voluptuous even. It took my breath away. The language of G & C is simply gorgeous but it is matched by the depth and profoundness of its content.<BR> <BR>As a latterly written prequel to \\"Hamlet\\", G & C is entirely credible because it is uncannily faithful to the spirit of its sourcebook. Shakespeare would embrace it without hesitation. The young Prince was always an introvert and a cold fish. Moody, sullen and remote, Hamlet's nature was the opposite of the sensual Gertrude's. He was clearly not his mother's son. Updike picks up on that inspiration to paint a startlingly human portrait of a young princess whose lively spirit was forcibly held in check, then gradually wilted as queen to a noble king until set free by the amorous wooing of her charming rogue of a brother-in-law. In Updike's hands, Gertrude comes gloriously alive as a lusty and passionate woman whose misfortune was to have been poorly matched in a politically motivated arranged marriage to a good but dull and officious man. It is a sympathetic characterisation and one that - if you think about it - is in total congruence with the Bard's Gertrude. Claudius may be more the fruit of Updike's fertile imagination but he is still a thrilling persona. A daredevil - quite the opposite of his brother - he is passionate like Gertrude but with a difference. He is also conniving and ruthless. The othersupporting characters including Polonius and Ophelia from \\"Hamlet\\" are all full bodied personalities. Great characterisation all round.<br />G & C is truly inspirational. I haven't read anything this good in a long while. It should have earned Updike far more accolades than it did. How could the critics have ignored such an incandescent and joyous piece of work ? This is classy literature, to be read and enjoyed over and over again. The best book I've read all year. Six stars.	2002-12-11
US	52572105	R2XLYDWYQXV4VE	0375413839	22904795	The Rotters' Club	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A book reviewer's favourite, RC is a delightful read	Incredible but true. Jonathan Coe's \\"The Rotters' Club (RC)\\" was at the top of nearly every London book reviewer's year-end recommended reads list last year. I was curious but sceptical, expecting another lightweight Nick Hornby type novel to while away the weekend but, seriously folks, there's more depth to RC than meets the eye. Heartwarming, touching and poignant, it is also fun, friendly and easy to read but it isn't pulp fiction. It may even be literature.<br />RC captures perfectly the political climate of 70s UK before Thatcher squashed the trades unions and steered England back onto its capitalist path. There's no doubt we're in the midst of a class war and Coe deftly throws us a shocker a quarter of the way through to remind us of the horrors of war and conflict - but RC isn't all grim and horrible. Hardly. The fellas on the shopfloor may be fighting their bosses by day, but they don't forget to have their bit of fun by night. Meanwhile, their children - the gang of four, whose varied exploits this novel is occupied with - experience the pains and the usual ups and downs of adolescence. Though awkward, irritating, confused, self conscious and love lorn, these kids dare to dream and it is the honesty and spontaneity of their dreams that make them such an endearing bunch. Nobody is painted in black or white. Even Cicely Boyd, the golden girl of every boy's wet dream, isn't a caricature of the school flirt we might expect. Maybe it's too early to tell. Let's see how the story pans out in the sequel promised to us. And a sequel there must be, for the last chapter (\\"Green Coaster\\") is all build-up and no climax, a tease with the promise of a pay-off in the next instalment. <br />Coe is also a master of wit and comedy. Benjamin's encounter with God viz the just-in-time appearance of a mysterious pair of swimming trunks is just one unforgettable and funny episode RC offers. There're loads more to delight you. Instantly accessible and great fun, I know why the reviewers loved it.	2002-11-21

It's light and breezy, silly and fun, with just a touch of sadness at its centre. The book overflows with whacky characters, all with bags of tricks up their sleeves to split your sides over and over again. Just when you think Theroux may have topped himself, he floors you with yet another with scarcely a breather in between. This is Theroux at his best.<br />Buddy Hamstra is an unlikely hero. He is a slob, unscrupulous, lacks a conscience, drinks and flirts too much and embodies all of mankind's most common frailties. In short, he's absurd but also thoroughly unforgettable. The narrator, a retired writer and Theroux's alter ego, is never just the passive observer. He is very much a part of the action and takes centrestage when he betrays feelings of jealousy when his wife's ex-lovers show up. The premise that his native wife (Sweetie) may be John John K's half-sibling is a hoot. <br />If the novel has one failing, it may be that it has packed in far too many transient characters who make a quick appearance, then exit, never to return to the pages again. Some of these characters could have been excised without any loss of coherence. In fact, it could have given the novel a tighter and more disciplined structure. Another thing. Some readers may be offended by Theroux's caricatures of the Polynesian natives and their customs but - seriously - how can you take offence when he's taking a dig at just about anybody on two legs ? <br />\\"Hotel Honolulu\\" is an absolutely delightful read. Definitely one for the road.	2002-11-08
US	52572105	R2S8U7LDGM2OML	0312421273	647099960	The Corrections: A Novel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Just great :  A slice of America's social history in fiction	Why the media hoopla and frenzied ecstacy over the publication of Jonathan Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\", you might ask ? Well, because it marks the arrival of a truly great fictional work that also reads like a slice of contemporary social history of America. As Franzen peels off the layers hiding the dysfunctionity of each member of the Lambert family (first Chip, then Gary, Enid & Alfred, and finally Denise), we are brought face to face with the multiple influences of change that have crept up on ordinary Americans in the last 50 years, made redundant old social values and reshaped their lives without having in the least prepared them for it. Alfred's tunnel vision of his role as family provider and disciplinarian, his stubborn refusal to embrace the values of an age where cash is king, Enid's desperate sublimation of her sexual frustrations from an unfulfilled marriage through drugs and medication, and their three grown-up children's confused or angry revulsion for their parents' anachronistic lives in St Jude, are all unmistakeable signposts of a society undergoing upheaval. While the oldies live in a time warp and pretend that the steam engine (not the almighty dollar) reigns supreme and decent people live like folks in \\"Father Knows Best\\", the kids fare no better. Gary, Chip and Denise are all strung out, Gary from nervous exhaustion from the demands of his yuppy wife Caroline and their brats, Chip from derailment as his teaching career falls apart after being falsely accused by a student of sexual harrassment, and Denise from her own confused career aspirations and sexual identity. <br />Franzen doesn't pull his punches. The Lamberts aren't especially likeable people, especially Gary (ironically the family's icon of success), whose selfishness and meaness borders on the spectacular. But even he is a victim. His wife Caroline comes close to but just escapes being a caricature. She's so scary but  a hoot. A real send up of a character. Chip and Denise are complex human beings. They're flawed but real and rounded. Franzen is simply a master of characterisation. Making us care for these Lamberts takes some special talent. They could be tiresome in less expert hands.  Enid gets her \\"one last Christmas party\\" wish at St Jude's but it's not a pretty scene. People bite each other's head off, arrive late, nearly miss one another, or wish they were gone no sooner than they get past the front door but somehow, this crazy and emotionally wired scene works. <br />Franzen is an amazing writer. He has that rare ability to achieve an intuitive though precarious sense of balance that juxtaposes the serious with the ridiculous and makes you laugh and cry at the same time. \\"The Corrections\\" is exemplary of the best of contemporary American literature. Believe the hype. Go buy yourself a copy. You won't regret it.	2002-11-01
US	52572105	R3JOUPP1O809QK	0452282829	872593606	We Were the Mulvaneys (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	3	7	11	N	N	Disappointing...not Oates' best by a mile	Joyce Carol Oates must be one of the most prolific contemporary novelists writing today. Her &quot;Black Waters&quot; was a slim book but it was powerful, full of resonance and simply unforgettable. &quot;We Were The Mulvaneys (WWTM)&quot; is a different sort of book. It is a family drama, thrice as long but sadly lacking in qualities I would consider essential in good narrative fiction. <br />The basic storyline pans out like bad afternoon TV soap opera. That this picture perfect upwardly mobile all-Americam family should crumble and fall apart so quickly after &quot;the incident&quot; is hard enough to believe. Straining credibility even further is the suddeness of decline in the Mulvaneys' economic fortunes. Worse, the poor Mulvaneys and the members of the community in which they live behave like they're in a time warp, like 50s characters resurrected for the post-Woodstock 70s. <br />After all that, how can we like or even feel sympathy for a family who behave like creeps to one another when the chips are down ? Mike Senior, the father, is easily the family's prize creep. His banishment of poor Marianne simply because she won't testify makes him easily the most selfish, self-loving and unsympathetic member of the clan. But sadly, his action doesn't ring true and that bothers me. Corinne, the loving wife and mother, is also ultimately a poorly drawn character. How can she be the novel's Mother Earth figure when she condones her husband's decision and yet carries on like she cares. Mike Junior - the hothead - is written out of the story early. Patrick, the angry intellectual and Mum's favourite, is unfortunately too introverted to stop the rot. He too flies the coop. Judd, the baby of the family, is such a feeble narrator we almost forget he's there. He flits in and out but never makes any impression on the reader. Marianne, the victim, is also a pale cardboard like character, a defiled Desdemona figure, if you like, but completely bloodless and uninteresting. Howcould she even stand to be with her parents after what they did to her ?<br />Oates clearly has problems with characterisation. But that's not all. Her less than steady hand at plot development is also manifest in the final 100 pages or so when she decides to bring this overlong and tiresome novel to a hasty close by orchestrating an instant family reunion that has an air of falseness about it. A quick but shoddy wrap-up that like feels like an after thought. <br />I also found Oates' prose suffocatingly longwinded and manic (in parts), especially the irritating asides in italics. Sorry, WWTM isn't an Oates novel I would recommend to anyone. She has written some wonderful thing before but this isn't one of them.	2002-10-17
US	52572105	R1E4NS7AP3UBG8	0060934417	546555129	Bel Canto	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Truly, a  work of genius and inspiration : delightful	At long last, we have an award winning novel you could recommend to a friend without hesitation or fear that it might fly above their heads, for far too often the literary awards circle has tended to recognise portentously serious works in favour of more accessible titles of equal merit and distinction in their annual awards. Without a doubt, Ann Patchett's \\"Bel Canto\\" is this year's novel to rave and die for. It is truly a work of inspiration and genius that celebrates life and brings hope to humanity.  <br />Patchett uses the occasion of a state party in some unnamed Latin American country to stage a hold-up and then watch how the hostages and their kidnappers, a randomly flung together cosmopolitan sample of humanity from opposite sides of the track first test the boundaries of trust with each other, then gradually loosen up and shed their skin as they discover their inner selves through the joys of music, love and beauty to become totally transformed - even transfigured - by the end of the story.  <br />Not surprisingly, Roxanne Coss, the glamourous opera singer, being the only woman hostage, becomes the central figure of obsession for the male hostages. More instructively, she is the catalyst for their transformation. Through her, some relive the memory of their former lives, rediscover their passion for their wives or put to test their latent culinary talents, others (from even among the terrorists), their thirst for knowledge, or talent for chess or singing. The longer the hostages and the terrorists remain an isolated community - we never venture beyond the gates - the more completely their worldly resolve weakens. As an idyllic calm settles upon their unreal existence and the barriers between hostages and terrorists dissolve to the point we're almost unable to tell them apart, it dawns upon us that nobody really wants the siege to end. Neither the hostages nor their kidnappers, because subconsciously perhaps they realise that the real enemy - the enemy of humanity - lies beyond the gates among the politicians and the military, and they don't want back their former existence. The seige had taught them that freedom isn't necessarily about physical space - the hostages accept the privilege of using the courtyard cautiously and joylessly - but about the heart, the mind and the soul.<br />Even as we bask in the glow of this strangely threatening paradise, the discerning reader is never in any doubt of the final outcome. No matter, for by then we're so much in Patchett's spell no downbeat ending can spoil the experience for us. \\"Bel Canto\\" is contemporary literature at its finest and most delightful. If there's only one book you have time for this season, let it be \\"Bel Canto\\". You won't be disappointed !	2002-10-09

Guys are just as likely to identify with Jo Becker's situation because Miller hits bulls eyes with this wonderfully resonant and keenly observed psychological thriller. Jo isn't perfect but she's real and utterly believable. Her itchiness to put her marriage at risk and recall if not re-experience her bohemian past with Eli Mayhew, the most shadowy member of her 60s gang, may be foolish, giddy headed and wrong but it's entirely credible and describes behaviour you encounter in real life. Miller's control over her plotting and pacing is nothing less than consummate, for when she pulls the jaw dropping shocker on us, I nearly freaked out.  From then on, the novel darkened and never read the same. Eli is a stroke of genius in characterisation. He's creepy (a loner), morally ambivalent and by far the most interesting character. Daniel, Jo's pastor husband, is sympathetic but oh-so-boring. His hurt and slow to heal response to Jo's betrayal makes him a bit of a prig. The grown up children (Cass, Nora and Sadie) complete the family. Though they aren't really essential to the plot development, they - notably the rebellious Cass - help us understand Jo better.  If not for Jo's past, how could anyone conceive of a pastor's wife, truly proud of and cheering her wasted daughter on at her gig ? Among modern female novelists writing about domestic life, Sue Miller must rank alongside greats like Anne Tyler, Jane Smylie, Alice Munro. There was never a dull moment reading &quot;While I Was Gone&quot;. Poignant and gripping, it is a wonderfully entertaining novel and comes highly recommended.	2002-09-29
US	52572105	RVHQO3AUV4X3U	0375756566	316489894	Austerlitz (Modern Library Paperbacks)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	An important and scholarly piece  of work	Less than a year after its publication, W G Sebald's \\"Austerlitz\\" is already being hailed as a modern masterpiece, one of those literary heavyweights that make such an indelible impression on critics and writers they're almost guaranteed a place on the \\"must read\\" list of future generations of literature students. I can see why. While likely to appeal mostly to serious readers - it certainly won't be cannon fodder for the youth or bestsellers market - \\"Austerlitz\\" isn't inaccessible or especially difficult for the persevering. Admittedly, the novel gets off to a slow start. The first hundred pages or so is packed with so much detail about places and objects you wonder at the point of these interminably dry passages, but once the unnamed narrator gets going, the long flowing sentences start to reveal a subtle and poetic rhythmn that brightens the character Austerlitz's confessional.<br />Austerlitz's unhappy childhood with his adoptive parents in England isn't the cause of his unsettled mind. It's the absence of memory - of his natural parents, their life together, their history and their fate - that has created this large hole he needs desperately to fill. There is a passage about homing pidgeons in there that perfectly encapsulates the novel's  theme of  the indestructability of identity and the futility of obliterating one's past. <br />\\"Austerlitz\\" reads like a black and white silent movie about the Holocaust years. There are no torrid scenes of Jews being gassed in chambers or roasted over flames, only ghostly images of derelict buildings and ash grey landscape to denote the pitilessness of the times.  Sebald's semi-documentary approach is made all the more deliberate by the use of b&w pictures of people, places, artifacts and landscape - all anonymous and unannotated - that produces a curiously distancing effect, suggesting perhaps an alignment of the general with the particular in the telling of the character Austerlitz's history. <br />\\"Austerlitz\\" is an important and scholarly piece of fictional writing. For serious readers only.	2002-09-23
US	52572105	R3BP9KXZZ18PU7	0002261944	783241042	As Meat Loves Salt	Books	4	15	20	N	N	An impressive though not fully assured debut	The critically acclaimed &quot;As Meat Loves Salt (AMLS)&quot; is an impressive debut by British novelist, Maria McCann. Due to the enormous amount of historical research that must have gone into its preparation, AMLS has been touted as a novel about the 17th Century English Civil War. Certainly, having a more than superficial knowledge of the Diggers movement and their mission to create a new society of free men would be helpful in understanding what makes our two protagonists tick, though it isn't strictly essential, for at the heart of AMLS is an unusual story of love and obsession between two men, the treatment of which should strike a responsive chord with modern readers of alternative literature, even among those without the least interest in English history.  <br />Jacob Cullen, a gentleman-turned-servant in a royalist estate, must be the most morally ambivalent protagonist of all time. The difference is, he knows it and we do too. He is given to bouts of murderous and lustful rage. His nemesis, Christopher Ferris, the graceful idealist soldier, is equally enigmatic. Though the less aggressive of the two, there is never any doubt that Christopher will be the one finally calling the shots.<br />The premise for the love story, though fascinating, is difficult to execute without some loss of credibility. The thought of these two macho men hitting on each other as soon as they have a moment alone together becomes slightly ludicrous and even embarrassing. The reader must feel like poor Becs after she has cottoned on to the truth. This and the (underwhelming) event that triggered their break up left me strangely befuddled. The love story, though central, may be the shakiest part of the novel.<br />The first part, set in the royalist estate, is full of interesting characters, adventure and intrigue. Pity it ended so abruptly. A more cogent plot could have developed from there. The middle portion, beginning with Jacob's rescue by Christopher after he flees the estate, is the risky bit. While it doesn't quite succeed, the love story solidly underpins the novel's centre. The concluding section, focussing on the building of the Diggers commune, could have been less rambling and more sharply written. <br />McCann is a promising writer. She has both style and craft and knows how to tell a story. AMLS may not be the realised masterpiece some critics have made it to be but I'll be looking out for her follow up. For all its faults, AMLS is still one of the best reads this season.	2002-09-12
US	52572105	R1XG3OSG0O686M	0060527099	627682796	Possession	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A finely crafted masterpiece from a tapestry of subgenres	A S Byatt's Booker Prize winning novel, \\"Possession\\", isn't just the literary sourcebook for the current movie of the same name. It is SERIOUS LITERATURE for SERIOUS READERS, so Movie Tie-In fans expecting a compactly written synopsis of the film are well advised to stay away. But if you're a literature aficionado, and wading knee deep in long flowery poems, obscure verses, beautifully but wordily written letters and journal entries isn't a problem or better still, your cup of tea, there's much in \\"Possession\\" that will delight and enthrall you. <br />Subtitled \\"A Romance\\", \\"Possession\\" is more than the coupling of an ancient with a contemporary love story, though the movie adaptation may have you believe that. Victorian poet Randolph Ash didn't just have a dirty weekend with fairy poetess Christabel LaMotte. Their secret liason did however result in an awkward outcome that should not surprise readers. In Byatt's hands, their love affair is cloaked in mystery and cerebral splendour and though it may be hard to fathom the foundation of their mutual attraction, its credibility doesn't suffer because the affair isn't played out in real time but reconstructed and deduced from fragments of evidence from the past. It's like examining a black and white print through frosted glass. As for the coupling of modern day academics Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell, those who have read the novel but not seen the film may be surprised that their relationship has been characterised as a romance. That to me is surely the crudest way of depicting Maud's and Roland's journey of self discovery as they collaborate in their research into the murky past of Ash & LaMotte and then join up in their undertaking to secure ownership of the invaluable evidence they have uncovered. <br />The flowing poems and verses may be the novel's styling, the romance its subject, but \\"Possession\\" is above all a thriller and a breathtakingly exhilarating one at that. No violence, bloodletting or shootouts, onlytreachery of the kind practised by learned men of letters. They're all so civilised yet undeniably vicious in their scheming and stalking of one another, it's like having one's throat slit by paper. So fine and fatal. Byatt's enactment of the final scene at the graveyard, where she calls upon the elements to unleash their destructive power, is a dramatic coup de grace that would translate perfectly on screen. <br />A S Byatt is a difficult novelist. Not surprisingly, \\"Possession\\" - her grand opus - doesn't make easy reading but a more finely crafted entity drawing upon a tapestry of subgenres you will not find. Truly a modern masterpiece. It'll be a tragedy if younger readers remember it as the book that inspired the film. Don't let that happen. Go read the real thing !	2002-09-05

Patrick Neate's &quot;Twelve Bar Blues (TBB)&quot; richly deserves the Whitbread Book of the Year Award. It's an epic novel tracing the torrid lives and lineage of gifted black cornet player Lick Holden from New Orleans who in the 1920s spends half his life searching for his coffee coloured half-sister Sylvie and present day retired prostitute Sylvia Di Napoli from London who will go to the ends of this world to discover her lost identity. Interlocking with these two fascinating stories is an experimental piece of magical realism that connects the past of Lick and Sylvia with the present in black Africa. Though the unfolding plot reveals a sprawling family tree that cuts across three continents, it isn't hard to guess how Lick and Sylvia are related to one another. Just as Lick survives many close shaves with Naps as his guardian angel, Sylvia's chance encounter with white drifter Jim Tulloch on route to New York turns out to be the source of her redemption. There is a recurring line in the novel about knowing or not knowing one's past and its bearing on the present that best sums up the quest of our protagonists. Lick knows his past but how has this helped him deal with his one obsession ? Sylvia, on the other hand, is resigned to a bleak future as an ex-prostitute and retired singer. She thinks discovering her past will save her but is too jaded to see that redemption is sitting right next to her. Who can blame her, though ? Fate and chance have a way of bringing a curious symmetry to life that we least expect. The African subplot in Neate's enthralling tale of ethnicity, lost identity and fate isn't as loose and arbitrary as it seems. The village chief has no hangups about his past.  He's proudly African and has no slave history in his family to contend with. His problem is with the future, in particular an urban wife and the uncertain paternity of the child she's carrying. TBB is a phenomenal literary achievement. It's earthy, brutal and passionate, yet wonderfully lyrical and otherworldly at the same time. Just as the fourth part of Lick's anatomy expands when he's riding the crest of a note from his cornet, the novel is magically transformed whenever Neate comes up with a passage that resonates with irony. TBB is a masterpiece of modern fiction that has to be read. Don't miss it !	2002-08-27

The experience is not dissimilar to tuning into a confession. But don't read the blurb and jump to the conclusion that you're dealing with some overhyped angst ridden family drama belonging to that genre much beloved by British book critics. \\"Oxygen\\" is exceptional because its writer is not only gifted with an uncommon eloquence, he has the rare intuitive ability to connect with the reader in a manner suggesting a dangerous knowledge of the human heart and that is what makes the difference. Alice Valentine is dying of cancer. Her two sons, Larry and Alec, return to Brooklands to spend her last days with her. The family is not estranged but separated, Alice in the loneliness of her terminal illness, her golden boy Larry in the shameful aftermath of his collapsing marriage and career in America, and the listless Alec in his own sense of failure as he struggles on with his translation work for a Hungarian playwright. They harbour truths about themselves they're barely able to recognise let alone confront or articulate, so Alice's death scene becomes the perfect occasion for them to come together, resolve their differences, exorcise their demons and settle the score. This they do, but quietly - strictly no histrionics - and in ways you least expect. Lazslo's story may be linked with Alec's by a thin narrative thread but he shares with Larry and Alec the same need for courage and redemption. Whilst Larry's release comes unexpectedly one evening after Alice suffers a fall, Alec digs deep to find the resolve to perform the ultimate act of heroism. For Lazlo, he sheds the burden of guilt for letting his lover die in enemy hands during the 1956 Hungarian uprising when he agrees to act as courier for a political cause. By using contrasting settings (domestic and bohemian) for his two stories, Miller universalises the issues and achieves an impact far beyond his contemplation. \\"Oxygen\\" is hugely deserving of its Booker Prize & Whitbread Prize nominations and the many accolades heaped upon it. A minor masterpiece.<br />--	2002-08-04

It must also be THE travel book to recommend to the uninitiated for not only will Mayle's incomparable wit and humour make instant converts out of you, it is guaranteed to leave you panting for more. You will want to read everything else Mayle has written as well as make a beeline for the nearest travel agent to make the French countryside if not Provence your next holiday destination. I know so for I count myself among the unashamedly smitten. Mayle's travel diary is neatly divided into twelve chapters, each corresponding with a month in the year.  Quite clearly, life in Provence is never dull.  Activities of its inhabitants are as varied as the climate and social custom will allow.  Escaping from rainy old England, Peter and his wife eagerly adapt. How could they not, with the weather this sunny and food this excellent ? Granted, the work ethics of contract workers and the habits of French road users may take some getting used to, but net net the conditions of French country living  are nothing less than idyllic. Mayle not only makes our mouths water when he waxes lyrical about every description of French country cuisine, he regales us with so many side splitting tales it is easy to lose count but impossible to forget, mostly about awful scroungers from England who descend on the Mayles expecting free board and lodging. &quot;A Year In Provence&quot; is such a deliriously happy and charming book it is bound to bring relief and joy even to the terminally depressed. I am also reliably informed by a friend that the Provence so picturesquely and vividly described by Mayle is as close as you can get to the real article. So, my recommendation is go buy yourself a copy, relish every word of it and head for your travel agent's.	2002-07-26

The film was entitled &quot;Short Cuts&quot; and this publication brings together these 9 stories (including a poem) which were culled from several original Carver publications. The book opens with an introduction by Altman who confesses to taking small liberties with Carver's stories and its characters but without compromising their integrity. Those who have seen the movie will concede that the changes in fact give the entity a coherence that would otherwise be missing. But as a collection of short stories. they can and should be read as standalones. Carver is a master of social commentary, using anecdotes of casual human behaviour to capture the absurdity of modern American life. These candid snapshots may not conform with the dictates of conventional fictional writing in that they may lack a beginning, distinct plot development and a neat ending. Often it isn't even the events that trigger off the response of the characters that are significant but the fact that they respond in a certain way that is interesting from the view point of understanding human behaviour. Carver seems to be saying that sometimes the strange things that happen to us are all due to chance and that like it or not, we need to factor chance into the equation of living. As a short story writer, Carver is exceptional. He has that rare ability to communicate some essential truth about the human condition without using melodrama or any of the other techniques frequently used by lesser writers to captivate and sustain our interest. The 9 stories in this collection are individually separate entities which exist in their own right. No character appears anywhere but in the story he originates from. The situations they capture are also pretty diverse. Yet, they don't seem disjointed when you read them in sequence. They are thematically bound together by Carver's magicwhich may be hard to define but there all the same. I found every one of them absorbing and captivating. Read this first before you watch the movie. You'll enjoy both better.	2002-07-22
US	52572105	R2ZH7IHTQL5NJA	0312287739	57804293	The Love of Stones: A Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A gripping historical thriller  about obsession with jewels	Tobias Hill's \\"The Love of Stones\\" (TLOS) is a historical thriller tracing the movement over the ages of the much coveted \\"Three Brethren\\" jewels which have passed through many hands and traversed many continents. There are two parallel and seemingly independent stories running alongside each other, one set in modern times and the other straddling the 19th & 20th centuries. Like two rivers, they cut through different terrains and flow at different speeds but finally converge in a surprise ending that may seem a little contrived but takes the novel into a whole new direction. Katherine Sterne, the heroine of the modern story, has only one thing on her mind. In her singleminded pursuit of the Three Brethrens, she takes inordinate risks with her own personal safety. Her obsession with jewels is neverly properly explained, although her final meltdown suggests there's blood coursing through her veins after all.  Until then, she's a blank, unknowable and unlikeable. She doesn't make conversation. Her utterances are typically monosyllabic and bad tempered. We follow her escapades half the world over as she picks up on clues left by her most recent informant and closes in on her prey. The other story set in the past about two Iraqi-Jew brothers, Daniel and Salman, is more poetic and emotional. Like ying and yang, the contrasting natures of the two brothers balance but do not cancel each other out. While it is Salman's drive and determination that gets them to London and become royal jewellers to Queen Victoria, it is the more sentimental and steadfast Daniel that lasts the course. TLOS is a racy thriller filled with unexpected twists and turns and lots of seedy characters that spring from nowhere and just as quickly disappear.  Of the minor characters, Eva Glott is the most well developed. Her incident with Sterne is especially memorable. TLOS is a finely crafted novel that makes absolutely rivetting reading.  Hill's plotting is superb throughout except for the ending whichbetrays a slightly unsteady hand. His prose, on the other hand, like the jewels he writes about, can be hard and awkward in places. It takes getting used to but it's no trouble once you get the hang of it.  One of the best novels I've read this season. Highly recommended.	2002-07-20

In this beautifully evocative 1997 winner of the Governor General Book Award, Jane Urquhart pierces the cerebral exterior of successful modernist artist Austin Fraser to reveal a cold callous soul, whose inability to give or receive love leads to unconscious acts of cruelty to those closest to him. Only upon reflection as an old man does he acknowledge his part in their fate but he has only memories to taunt not console him. Sara, his model and lover of many years, proves to be nothing more than a handy object holding a mirror to his own soul. She doesn't really exist for him, hence when they break up, he looks back upon a relationship spanning fifteen summers, not fifteen years. Not surprisingly, the fox in Sara's garden - a metaphor for Sara's inner self - doesn't exist in his mind simply because he has never seen it.  When his mentor Rockwell critiques his paintings, it turns out to be an indictment of the painter himself. Austin is furious but finally unable to deny Rockwell's judgement. Vivian, heartless and vain, is Austin's spiritual twin in the novel. They are an anathema to George and Augusta, whose lives are deeply rooted in reality. George is also an artist, but unlike Austin, doesn't despise industry but works in his father's china shop and has survived the war. Augusta is a farm girl, warm, practical and disciplined, and the perfect partner for George until Vivian, with Austin's help, re-enters their lives one evening with devastating result. &quot;The Underpainter&quot; brilliantly exposes the selfishness of art for art's sake. It is a chilling reminder that art unless tempered by humanity ultimately conceals more than it reveals. Jane Urquhart is a tremendous novelist. &quot;The Underpainter&quot; is a gorgeously written and incandescent piece of work that leaves an indelible impression long after it's read.	2002-07-12
US	52572105	R1U5W1ANUT0UGE	0375726403	340719393	Empire Falls	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Great plot, exquisitely written & every bit a prize winner	\\"Empire Falls (EF)\\" deserves to win this year Pulitzer Prize simply because it is so exquisitely written. It isn't particularly deep or weighty in content. Neither does it pretend to offer any profound insights into our human condition. What it does offer is great storytelling on which Richard Russo gets to display the virtues of his craft as a novelist. EF - the title, if you get it, has a double meaning - is full of thwarted and unfulfilled people. People whose lives are filled with regret and compromise because they didn't have the courage to follow their destinies, people who feel they deserve better. This condition doesn't just afflict the struggling or the down and out. Even the Whitings who own half the town cannot escape this curse. Protagonist Miles lusts hopelessly after waitress Charlene but finds himself playing good Samaritan to poor crippled rich girl Cindy who is love with him due to guilt and conditioning by his once-fallen-but-otherwise-saintly mother Grace. Wife Janine wrecklessly risks all for a second chance with Walt, who is long on promise but short on delivery, in retaliation against her dead marriage to Miles whom she despises and regards as a pathetic wimp. Unhappy daughter Tick is saddled with school outcast John when she secretly longs to rekindle a relationship with some boy she met briefly at Martha's Vineyard one summer. Corrupt cop with a complex Jimmy Minty goes out of his way to be hateful to Miles because deep deep down inside he craves Miles' acceptance....and it is this way with the other characters in the novel, except for the unapolegetically bad and incorrigible Max. He would be played by Jack Nicolson in a movie adaptation of EF. The story could easily have degenerated into farce or cheap melodrama. In Russo's expert hands, it is transformed into a tightly structured and compelling tale of human folly that's anchored by equal measures of poignance, humour and truth. Strong characterisation also makes us care deeply about theirfate. The novel may be downbeat but never depressing. Russo isn't a pessimist. Even Francine Whiting, the town's black widow, reveals a side to herself nobody would have foreseen. EF is a big novel but you when it ends, you feel you haven't had enough of it. One of the best novels this season and every bit a prize winner !	2002-07-05
US	52572105	R2LP04YJO727I3	0312420196	85872492	Border Crossing: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent thriller that just missed being great	Pat Barker makes writing seem so easy. Like Muriel Spark, her prose is always crisp, lucid, eloquent and smooth and for these qualities alone, it is always a pleasure to read anything by her. \\"Border Crossing (BC)\\", her latest novel, serves up cat and mouse styled mind games played between two protagonists with a shared past whose unlikely connection with each other is revealed after a shocking incident that will alter the course of their lives forever. Barker doesn't waste time setting the scene or building up tension. A distracted Tom Seymour, out on a jog with his wife one evening, witnesses a suicide attempt on the river. It takes him seconds to decide to dive after the man to prevent it.  Why did Tom risk his life for a stranger ? Was he responding to the dangers of the moment or the pressures of a crumbling marriage ? This is the sort of question we ask ourselves as the story unfolds. Barker proves she's no novice at writing pyschological thrillers. She skillfully keeps us in a state of anxiety and suspense throughout. There's also a palpable smell of danger in the air and a threat of violence that never quite breaks out.  As a thriller, BC works because it's highly absorbing and gripping. Pity the novel never quite develops beyond establishing whether or not Danny committed the murder he was convicted for. Or whether Danny is the master of deception those who comes into contact with him say he is. We do get definitive answers to these questions. We even get to observe and make our own judgements about the horror of society's response to juvenile crime and its aftermath. That Barker never used Danny to hold the mirror to his nemesis' soul and allowed us readers to truly get under Tom's skin is something of a disappointment. BC is a wonderfully accomplished novel. It could have been great one had Barker mined its premise for its full potential. I would give this four and a half stars rating if I could. If not, it's closer to five than four stars. One of the best novels to have been published in 2001.	2002-07-01
US	52572105	R17MAOYKD3ZL36	0375724672	96071634	True History of the Kelly Gang: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Brilliant but a little too calculated for my taste	Peter Carey joined the exclusive company of J M Coetzer when he snazzed the prestigious Booker Prize Award a second time for \\"True History of the Kelly Gang\\" (THOKG\\"). Never before were the British book critics so unanimous in their praise and selection of THOKG as \\"the best read of 2001\\"... Anyway, read it I did and the verdict is positive. Though grappling with the novel's ungrammatical vernacular can prove challenging for the non-native reader, Ned Kelly's voice is such a rich and potent instrument you find yourself responding to its heady prose at an emotional level even if some of its literal meaning escapes you. I can see why THOKG is such an obvious choice for the awards. The premise of documenting one's own personal history to set the records straight and redeem your character and moral standing with your unborn child is a promising one and Carey milks this vantage perspective to its full advantage. Kelly has us eating out of his hands when we cotton on to the conspiracy among the nation's law enforcers to nail him and his family for every act of mischief ever committed against society. His growing associations with bushrangers, thieves and robbers, as the story enfolds, only reinforce the impression that Ned and his gang were driven to it by the need to safeguard their own livelihood and protect their own kin against the unfairness of their loathesome prosecutors. Kelly's devotion to his mother, hapless and worn out by the antics of the many scoundrels who compete to take her husband's place in their marriage bed after his demise, is both touching and heroic. Kelly and his gang's last fight to secure his mother's release from gaol has all the excitement and flourish of an great adventure story. Carey is courageous, swanky and stylish in his delivery and executes his ventriloquist act with great aplomp. However, in my judgement, an exhilirating read though THOKG undoubtedly is, there is something calculated about it that I distrust. It may be the obvious title to beat in last season's book awards but me, I prefer the more controlled style and humour of Matthew Kneale's \\"English Passengers\\", which in my opinion is one of the most outstanding fictional titles published in the last 3 years.	2002-06-12
US	52572105	R1DFSFO8Y0ZUX3	0375421041	27158829	The Dark Room: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Three German perspectives of the Second World War	Rachel Seiffert's debut novel entitled \\"The Dark Room (DR)\\" is named after the first of its three novellas. For a first effort, it is a remarkably confident and mature piece of work examining the effect of the Holocaust on the psyche of generations of Germans who had lived or whose parents and grandparents had lived through the trauma of those terrible years.  Each of the three stories lend a different perspective to the events that took place. <br />The first of these, while the shortest, is also in some ways the most touching because there is a tragic innocence about Helmut's patriotism that is entirely believable. He makes up for his physical handicap and inability to participate more directly in the war by using his photographic skills to document it.  That's his way of dealing with his personal guilt. The camera becomes Seiffert's metaphor for perspective as it makes a return appearance in the concluding segment of the novel. <br />The middle story entitled \\"Lore\\" is arguably the most direct because it depicts suffering but it is also the least satisfying of the three stories. Here, our teenage heroine escapes with her younger siblings to their grandmother's after their parents' arrest by the Allied forces at the end of the war. Seiffert's message in \\"Lore\\" isn't that Germans too suffered during the war. Rather, it is about the loss of innocence and the pain of betrayal. Lore is a young girl, barely into her teens and totally uncomprehending of the evil surrounding her. Her feeling of betrayal, upon discovering the true identity of the kindly Thomas whom she even develops a slight crush on and the truth behind the pictures of Jewish torture victims, is a searing pain she and even we find hard to bear. But the story drags on a bit and becomes repetitive and interminable past a certain point. <br />The final instalment named \\"Micha\\" after its protagonist, focuses on guilt and responsibility borne by the post-war generation of Germans for the crimes committed by their forefathers against the Jews. So schoolteacher Micha's life remains in turmoil until he learns to confront his beloved Opa's past. He travels to Belarus to interview an old couple whom he hopes will have the answers to his questions but is thrown when he learns the truth, which is never as straightforward as it seems. Even ordinarily good people behave unusually in unusual times and it is futile for Micha to try to reconcile his image of the loving Opa he knew with the Opa who, like many others in the war, was tainted by blood on his hands. There seems to be a collective abdication of responsibility on the part of individuals for their actions during the war because the leadership had supplied the cause and the justification. It is a chapter surviving generations of Germans should acknowledge and accept but not forget. \\"Micha\\" is by far the most powerful and deeply resonant of the three novellas. <br />Seiffert's \\"The Dark Room\\" will move you to tears. It is an outstanding piece of work and completely worthy of the enormous amount of praise - including a Booker Prize nomination - heaped upon it.	2002-06-09

It's about simplicity, clarity and integrity in conveying some essential truth about our human condition. &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot;, Lahiri's Pulitzer Prize winning short story collection, embodies all these qualities. The stories are mostly though not exclusively about immigrant Indians who have settled overseas and the cultural displacement they experience in their adopted homeland. Sometimes, the perspective is reversed, the location shifts back to the Indian subcontinent and we observe how second generation Americans of Indian origin are regarded when they return as tourists to their motherland. The stories are varied and thoroughly enchanting but the ones that work best are those that capture the absurdity of ordinary situations. There are no heroes and villains in these stories, just people who are vaguely discontent in their relationships due to disharmony with their new environment. &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot;, the collection's centrepiece, is absolutely brilliant. It is poignant, yet humourous and the ultimate comedy of errors. &quot;A Temporary Matter&quot;,  &quot;When Mr Pirzada Came To Dine&quot;, &quot;A Real Durwan&quot; and &quot;Mrs Sen&quot; are also memorable and deeply affecting for the little truths they reveal. It's great to see that the award committees are finally getting back to basics and recognising the virtues of good writing. Far too often, the splashier titles hog the headlines when it is timeless books like &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot; that are the more enduring and enjoy the longest shelf life. I'd be willing to bet that a decade from now, people would still be reading Lahiri's collection when other more showy titles have lost their shine.	2002-06-01

I loved nearly every moment of it. Mitchell takes us on a magical mystery tour through major cities and other exotic locations in Asia (Okinawa, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Mongolia) and Europe (St Petersburg, London, Ireland) and uses the short story medium to showcase current phenomena and burning issues of the day, from the horrors of terrorism, nuclear war risks, fraud and corporate greed, to eastern mysticism, political blackmail, and love and infidelity. The individual stories are presented as a series of self contained vignettes which are bound together by a common sensibility running through them. Occasionally, a familiar character may resurface without warning only to vanish just as suddenly. The fleeting reappearance of characters from past episodes makes them feel like passing ghosts in the night. The stories are multi-genreal and though different as chalk and cheese, share a sense of the unexpected.  My own personal favourites are  the ones set in St Petersburg, Hong Kong and Ireland. Only the last story disappoints. It's bizarre and difficult to follow and a downbeat ending to an otherwise spectacular collage of scenes from our modern age. David Mitchell is such a talented contemporary writer I reckon we will hear alot more from him in the future. For a first effort, \\"Ghostwritten\\" is an incredibly mature, assured and imaginative piece of work. One of my best reads this season.	2002-05-26
US	52572105	R2GXYC0QPODOJK	0375726659	814842893	No Great Mischief: A Novel	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Quiet, low key and beautifully understated	If anyone should doubt the book critics' relevance in guiding readers' choices, look no further than Alistair MacLeod's &quot;No Great Mischief (NGM)&quot;. If not for its constant appearance on their notable reads list, the publication of NGM would likely have gone unnoticed because it's a low key unshowy kind of book that's unlikely to attract attention. But thanks to them, I have discovered a gem about one's family, clan, and roots. Quiet, reflective, and lovingly narrated by a modern day MacDonald in Ontario, the story traces the history of the MacDonalds back to the 17th Century when its first immigrant parent arrived from Scotland to settle in Canada, desperate and poor. The author takes certain liberties with chronology - eg, toggling between scenes of the narrator as a successful dentist and a coal miner working alongside his older brothers can be a challenge  -  but it's consistent with the story's dreamlike quality. Recurring images or memories unfold like a chorus that locks you into the rhythmn of the song. There are many scenes that are simply unforgettable and will remain firmly etched in your mind, like that of the dead immigrant's wife being offloaded into the sea, the family dog swimming against the tide into the arms of its owner, the tragic ice accident that claimed his parents' lives, his brothers melting ice from buckets to make their morning coffee, the horrific decapitation of a MacDonald in the mines, etc. These floating images, coupled with the impression that the MacDonalds have multiplied like rabbits and all but conquered Ontario, only serves to reinforce the novel's theme of blood and kinship. If only MacLeod had been less presumptuous about his reader's knowledge of Canadian Confederation history and its Scottish anticedent, the references to how key characters fought for opposite sides at different points would have made more sense. Despite these slight misgivings, I enjoyed NGM tremendously. MacLeod's prose has a beautifully understated and intimate cadence to it that suggests an assuredness absent from much of what passes today as good contemporary writing. NGM won't change your life but it'll add to it. Highly recommended.	2002-05-17

Ballard's latest novel, the critically acclaimed \\"Super-Cannes\\", is a futuristic thriller set in a high-tech business park somewhere in Cannes, where the eerie hum of economic activity within the cloistered confines of offices and laboratories substitute for real human contact. The novel's protagonist and narrator, Dr Paul Sinclair and his wife Jane, arrive in Cannes and are immediately checked into the house formerly occupied by Jane's ex-colleague from England, David Greenwood, who shocked the township when he went on a murderous rampage one morning, killing several of his colleagues before turning the gun on himself. So, unlike a typical murder mystery, we know who did it. The question is why ? Incapacitated by a bad leg from a flying accident, Paul sets about investigating the incident while his wife disappears like clockwork into the shining concrete jungle every morning. The first half of the novel ticks like a detective story, focussing on Paul's sleuthing as he retraces the events of that fateful morning. Nothing unusual so far except for creepy new age characters like the chief psychiatrist, Wilder Penrose security guard, Frank Halder. Nevertheless, there is a mounting sense of disquiet as the story progresses. Notice you never actually see Jane or anybody else at work. In fact, the only people you meet are neighbours and others relevant to Paul's investigation. Then something completely unexpected happens and you feel as if you're in another story. Hints of weird goings-on (eg, racial violence, gang busts, etc) and drug addiction start to surface and when this coincides with Jane's growing estrangement from her husband, you know there's an external force at work and it's to do with powerful occupants of the tech park. That's when you feel you may be hallucinating or have wandered into a Ballardian science fiction novel by mistake. Unfortunately, that's also when the plot begins to feel a little contrived. Super-Cannes is a real page turner. No doubtabout it. As a thriller, it succeeds well enough but its vision of a work obsessed society with the all the attendant value perversions that accompany it is, though frightening, not particularly illuminating. Super-Cannes may not be Ballard's best work but it's highly entertaining and definitely worth your time reading it.	2002-05-07

Sam's displacement from his domestic environment is mirrored in his wife's and son's futile attempt to rediscover his old familiarity which seemingly evaporated during his long absence. His inability to articulate his feelings about the war locks him into his own world where nobody can reach him.  The fragile nexus holding together conjugal relationships is also revealed in the aftermath. The novel opens optimistically with the reunion scene but from there it's downhill all the way.  Soon, the nerves start to fray and bouts of anger fill the void.  The horrors of war may have reduced Jackie to a mental invalid but Sam is forced to admit that he misses the sense of purpose fighting for kin and country in the jungles of Burma. Coping with the vestiges of the old life is just too much for him. Ellen and Joe are the victims of this cruel irony when Sam decides to build a new future for himself and his family away from home. Bragg captures the tension of disintegrating relationships with a rare economy and insight.  He pays great attention to period details with elaborate descriptions of provincial life. The novel is filled with many such passages which will no doubt endear themselves to British readers for the air of familiar nostalgia they create. For the rest of us, they can seem rather interminable. &quot;The Soldier's Return&quot; doesn't break any new grounds. It treads a well trodden path but does it with authenticity and honesty and for that, it is has to be applauded. It is an accomplished piece of work that deserves to be read.	2002-04-28

It's not hard to see why. Rarely has the choice of a title been this compelling in recent years. EP is outstanding for its literary and intellectual qualities, historical interest, social relevence and comic wit. It is also immensely funny in its tongue-in-cheek commentary on tragically well meaning but hopelessly blinkered colonialists who try to bring civilisation to savages in faraway lands. Although EP's mixed genred interests defy easy categorisation, it has, for want of a convenient pidgeon hole, been labelled a travel tale. A bunch of smugglers find themselves mixed up with an Anglican pastor leading a motley crew, whose members include a botanist and a Machiavellan doctor intent on proving his theory on genetic determinism, in search of the Garden of Eden. Together they set sail for the island of Tasmania on the other side of the southern hemisphere, each in pursuit of his own agenda. Meanwhile, the colonialist government of Australia is hapless in its defence of the aboriginal population against the marauding ways of the worst of its white settlers. Kneale's genius is in seamlessly knitting together these disparate elements and using different voices and a dual time scale to tell a fascinating story that is at once absorbing, tragic and comic. The novel boasts a wide cast of memorable characters, many of whom make only cameo appearances but leave behind a distinct impression. The pious and self-righteous Reverend Geoffrey Wilson is a scream. To see his mental state reduced to that of an inmate for the nuthouse is to revel in poetic justice. From the pleading letters and confessionals of the various characters, we enter their minds and hearts and emerge with different perspectives from which to judge their actions. Kneale reserves his master stroke for the last with an ending that simply resonates with irony. So much for Dr Thomas Potter's crackpot theory of genetic determinism. \\"English Passengers\\" is a rare literary treasure that will delight readers for years to come. This is literature at its most incandescent. I can't praise it enough. Please read it !	2002-04-24

Sure, the mafia-like grip of Japan's all-powerful financial and business oligarchy over the nation's wealth and economy and the Imperial Family's collusion in willingly playing the part of a stooge in return for a lifetime of comfort and wealth with America's secret backing is a shocking eye opener for readers who know little of Japan's history. Reading the book helps us understand why the Japanese economy remains moribund and in a state of paralysis since the bubble burst in the early 90s. Genuine reform cannot take place because the oligarchs and political leaders pulling the strings will never act against their own interests. Neither will the bureaucracy which feeds from it. A truly damning appraisal of the state of Japan as a nation. Yet, I had difficulty accepting all of the Seagraves' account of it as history because of their highly controversial if not downright sensational style in telling it. If history were written and taught this way in school, you'd have no problems filling up the class. Don't get me wrong. The book makes for rivetting reading. It is absolutely unputdownable. Nevertheless, historians might react with horror at some of the gross oversimplication of the truth as told by the Seagraves. It is not difficult to imagine that that they might call into question the source and accuracy of some of the information used in the book. The Seagraves' monochrome/black and white portrayal of the wide cast of characters also turns history into faction, if not soap opera. I enjoyed 'The Yamato Dynasty\\" tremendously and would recommend it without hesitation to others. But I would be cautious in reading it as history. Better to judge it as a dramatised story of the Japanese imperial family in the post-Meiji era.	2002-04-23

It is well written. Its subject is meticulously researched so that every detail of the religious life she writes about corresponds with reality. Her characters are, as always, mostly of the sour, dour, hard bitten and cynical variety and clearly a breed apart from the cartoonish types that populate Agatha Christie's stories. As readers, we relate to them because we can almost pick them out from the people we know in our lives. Even our favourite detective hero, Adam Dagliesh, harbours secrets from the past and has a slight hint of romance and sexiness to him that appeals to female readers. True to form, James is unstinting in creating the right atmosphere for the plot to develop. There are even the usual proven Jamesian flourishes like a sudden recollection of some minor connection with the past that proves fatal etc, which makes the story a real page turner. The let down for me was in the anticlimactic ending. The denouement was disappointing because it just wasn't up to her usual \\"dark\\" standards. I was frankly underwhelmed. Never mind. Better plotting the next time and there will always be a next time for me because P D James is my all time favourite detective mystery writer. A respectable if not outstanding work.	2002-04-21

I finally gave up on \\"Mating\\" after a gruelling week of struggle to get past the interminable chapters of this absolutely dreadful book. My endurance simply packed up and deserted me. I had to resort to skimming the last 100 pages or so and even that provided scant relief. I must have read close to a hundred books these past two years but none has proved this frustrating. There is some semblence of narrative or plot progression in the way the story unfolds and sure, parts of it even make quite revitting reading, but these are so few and far between they're not worth the bother. \\"Mating\\" sets out to be an ambitious novel of ideas but these ideas don't seem to be properly delineated, developed and thought out. Most of the time it reads like a horribly confused and badly written treatise on subjects as diverse as the matriachial society, feminism, mating instincts, socialism, alternative organisational structures, even racism and corruption.  The book is rendered even more dense and inaccessible by its pseudo intellectual babble which prolongs the agony of reading and worse, dissolves ultimately into noise. Much as I persevered, I got nothing out of it. Neither pleasure nor enlightenment.  I remain as clueless now as before I started on it. It is incredible that \\"Mating\\" won the National Book Award.

US	52572105	RYL1OLI27TUWG	140003065X	366389334	A Fine Balance	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Great literature of the history of India	Rohinton Mistry's multiple award winning \\"A Fine Balance (AFB)\\" is a magnificent novel, a must read for anyone interested in India and its rich cultural heritage and history. It is also a big, though not difficult, novel. Told in straightforward narrative, it is a story of an independent minded Parsi widow struggling to keep her garment contracting business afloat, two poor village tailors she employs illegally and a middle class undergraduate boarding with her. The plot is set in an unnamed location in India during the Emergency Law years in the 70s under the regime of a unnamed female prime minister. The use of an anonymous setting is a masterful stroke of genius as it opens up the canvas for Mistry to telescope and paint the vast history of India in all its multifaceted complexities onto 500 or more pages of living, breathing prose of the finest order. The India we see through the entwined lives of these four protagonists is characterised by ethnic strife, religious intolerance, caste bound prejudices, and sexual inequality.  Notwithstanding differences in their social backgrounds, they suffer the same cruel fate and gross indignities of an ancient values system painfully at odds with a progressive world. Just as the courageous Dina fights an uphill battle against her brother's smug chauvinism and the forces of a corrupt public administration, the tailors Ishvar and Omprakash sink under the deadweight of a caste ridden society that considers any attempt at social mobility an anathema.  Then there is Maneck, the poor little rich boy who appears to be having it relatively easy compared to the rest until the last frame when we find ourselves agape and numb with shock, contemplating his damaged soul and the pitiless horror of his final act. The impact is simply devastating. The novel's bleakness and despair deepens as the plot draws to a close. By then, our tears would have been flowing fast, yet we'd also have witnessed acts of heroism (big and small), self sacrifice, and common decency that restores our faith in humanity. These four characters and several memorable others who populate and enrich the novel's vast human landscape, wrestle with and finally overcome tradition bound prejudices to be united through suffering in love.  Mistry's message of hope is not \\"love conquers all\\". Who would believe him ? But without love, what hope is there that humanity will continue their fight to free the millions enslaved by cruel institutions of ancient customs and beliefs which can have no place in modern civilised societies ? Mistry is a classic storyteller. In AFB, he has produced a stunning masterpiece, an astounding work of breadth and vision. It is great literature at its most relevant and powerful and one of the most important novels to have been published in the past decade.	2002-03-18

In small town America, in a little place called Verity, where emotional refugees from upstate New York like Lucy and the unfortunate murder victim seek shelter from their private storms, we are joined midway and quite suddenly by Angel, a phantom figure and the afterlife reincarnation of Julian's cousin who had died tragically behind the wheels during an in-car fight many years ago. Up to this point, the cast of characters and plot deveopment were pretty much standard psycho thriller fare but the arrival of Angel changed all that. His benign ghostly presence and gentle haunting over the affairs of Verity's folks gives the novel an otherworldly feel that very nearly transforms TM into a fable. As a murder mystery, TM succeeds in maintaining the suspense right through the end. While we're following the emotional ups and downs of Verity's inhabitants, we still want to know whodunnit. The dry scorching heat floating off the pages of TM aggravates the grief of these [people] - they're all running away from spouses, parents, betrayals or memories - but Hoffman isn't a pessimist. Her faith in human nature is like a beacon of light that remains undimmed throughout. Consider. Even the \\"worst behaved boy in the world\\" finds courage in the face of extreme adversity. Likewise, the growing romantic attachment between Lucy and Julian can only be mutually healing. They both seek redemption for their past. Hoffman only loses her balance once, lapsing into sentimentality when she has the bad boy Keith fall for the dog and pays the price for it. TM is otherwise an excellent and wonderfully entertaining book that you can<BR>enjoy and finish within a day.	2002-03-01

As a thriller or murder mystery, it is in a class of its own. No two ways about it. But Tartt had loftier aims and it would be criminal not to recognise her breathtakingly fresh look at the face of evil. Richard Papen, the narrator, didn't know it lived within his own soul until it was too late. Neither did the others in the clique he drifted into. Like Jean Brodie's girls, Julian's boys (Henry, Bunny, Francis, Charles) & Camilla are a reactionary bunch. They are encouraged by their study of the Greek classics to explore the outer limits of freedom and abandonment. On one fateful April night, their experiment went a little too far resulting in a horrific and senseless murder, which in turn triggered the masterminding of a second murder to cover up the first. It's perhaps tempting to see their mentor Julian as a kindly old fuddy-duddy but what he represents and fosters - consciously or otherwise - is a heartless amorality infinitely more frightening than the actual murders themselves evoke. Look how he reacts when the truth finally stares him in the face. The enactment of the Dionysian frenzies in the forest is for me quite the most chilling passages ever written. It spooked me out because it was about the EVIL in us being given the night off and on a rampage. Henry's outburst in reaction to Julian's indifference is telling and insightful. These boys are sick of the decadence in their lives. What they need for therapy is the exact opposite of what the Greek philosophers espouse. Dark ironies. Tartt's writing is beautifully taut, precise and lucid. She skillfully sustains the seething momentum of quiet hysteria all through the first half of the novel. Only after the second murder is committed does the pace slacken somewhat but it quickly regains its lost momentum to deliver a shattering ending that will leave you shaking. \\"The Secret History\\" is such an outstanding and accomplished work it should be included in every literature student's reading list. A monumental advertisement for the thriller genre.	2002-02-22

Subtlety, style and quiet restraint typifies this strikingly beautiful and confident work of Atwood's.  It may seem hard to believe but she gets better and scales new heights with each new novel. For a start, the story within a story structure is a masterful sleight of hand. There is even a third sci-fi story just waiting to burst forth from the fictional story. As we peel away successive layers of the onion to reveal a core of uncertain truths (and lies), we steal glimpses of the misty past of Iris & Laura Chase, including their growing up years during the Great Depression and a multitude of compromises foisted upon them that would shape their destinies. Excerpts from Laura's own novel are intermittently but skillfully spliced into Iris' narration from the vantage point of an old woman. The fictional story - about an unnamed lady of high social standing and her bohemian lover - is suitably obscure, hinting at Laura's own left-field sensibilities. Iris, on the surface the resident matyr of the Chase clan, reveals a hidden dimension to her character. When Atwood finally drops the big one on us, we are floored by the subtlety and understatement of her revelation. Still waters run deep. The impact of Atwood's prose, graceful and ethereal, is magnified by the controlled power of her delivery. I can think of no finer book to recommend to anyone this year. BA is a major triumph for Atwood. May the ink of her pen flow on forever.	2002-02-15

I can see why. On the surface, HG reads like a none too extraordinary murder mystery. The heroine gets bumped off real early. She leaves behind a grieving and befuddled lover who sleuths away to discover that she had led another life in secret whilst cohabitating with him. As he peels off the layers to unmask her real identity, we are thrown into a nightmarish world of sex abuse, drugs, prostitution, a make believe family history and a sordid past that made Rosa Kelly the damaged person she had become. Her love affair with magician Brendan Fletcher never had a chance. It was doomed from the start because she'd lost her innocence and was in no fit state to accept let alone give love. All in all, pretty unexceptional stuff, you might think, but what elevates HG above the more formularic efforts of others writing in the same genre is Bedford's craft in exquisitely blending the thriller with the human interest elements to produce a novel that is at once gripping, intelligent, touching and believable. His contrasting treatment of the illusionist's magic and Rosa's deliberate deception of Brandon is both poignant and painful. The premise for HG wasn't especially promising but the result is spectacular. The book reviewers were right. HG is a wonderfully entertaining novel you wouldn't want to miss.	2002-02-11

They tug and pull and for a long time, the game looks like it could go either way, but after much heaving and jostling, the rope gives way and both sides fall to the ground. That pretty much sums up the plot of Andre Dubus III's \\"House of Sand and Fog \\" (HSF). At one end, we have ex-Iranian Colonel Behrani asserting his rights to contract on the purchase of an auctioned property. At the other, Kathy Nicolo is contesting the sale of the same property - once hers - by the state county. Kathy is abetted by troubled cop Lester who has fallen for her. The tragic outcome of this explosive contest of wills is predictable, leaving a trail of broken and lost lives. But what makes HSF such an intriguing novel is Dubus III's true-to-life characterisation and his skillful use of the human condition to expose gaps in the East-West cultural divide and force us to reflect upon the equity of certain values which Americans hold dear. The irony of Colonel Behrani's impasse with Kathy is made all the more bitter by the fact that the very society that purports to uphold the principle of the sanctity of contract is about to cheat him of his last hope of restoring his pride and position within his family. Despite his occasional wrongheadedness, I found him a more sympathetic character than the out-of-control Kathy. Lester I disliked and despised until I understood how Kathy offered an escape from an unhappy marriage and a release from his own pent up neediness. I was ready to dismiss HSF as melodrama but was won over by Dubus III's directness, integrity and style. HSG is a gripping thriller that's simply unputdownable.

Encouraged by glowing reviews, I joined the ranks of its swelling readership only to have my raised expectations dashed. A little. Not that it isn't an enchanting little novel. It is. Only that I expected more. What it offers is old hat and lacks profoundness. The message of daring to dream and follow one's dream isn't new. The proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow - here, the treasure the boy shepard seeks in the Pyramids - is, of course, an illusion and not so different from Fitzgerald's &quot;green light across the bay&quot; that lured Gatsby to his tragic end.  The treasure we covet isn't external to us but lies within ourselves and like raw diamond, will reveal its lustre only when polished, ie it is the journey (not the arrival) that confers wisdom and maketh the man. Paul Coelho's simple unpretentious style makes &quot;The Alchemist&quot; a quick and entertaining read but it's no great shakes. I can't see what the fuss is all about.	2002-01-25

Boasting some of the most gorgeous prose ever committed to print, it is bursting with heartfelt yearning and promise for the future as it traces the path taken by the celebrated stage actress Maryna and her community of friends, who embittered by their history of colonisation by the Russians, chose to leave Poland in the late 19th century to build a utopian commune in America. Their grand agrarian experiment to rediscover the vitality of simple living and return to basics fails. Due to lack of experience or otherwise, Maryna's commune comprising scholars, writers, painters and their families, breaks up and some of them return to their former lives in Poland. Maryna herself, after a brief period of self imposed exile returns to active professional life and quickly establishes herself as a celebrity once again but this time in her newly adopted country. &quot;In America&quot; raises a whole cache of fascinating ideas. It contrasts the inherent cynicism and corruption of old world values with the innocence, optimism but also shallowness of new world morality.  Sontag's ambitious novel starts off promisingly, using an unnamed female narrator who then mysteriously disappears, never to show up again. The narrative then segues seamlessly into a penetrating and fascinating peek into the Polish soul. Using a blend of shifting perspectives, the experience is both insightful and mesmerising. But when the utopian commune breaks up, some of the magic in Sontag's writing also evaporates. Certainly I found the final 100 pages or so a little pedestrian.  The use of a jumble of literary formats including letters, poems, rotating confessions, etc also gives a slightly disjointed and unstructured feel to the book. The concluding section featuring a soliloquy by Edwin Booth emerges from nowhere to close the book ! Talk of abrupt endings. However, the high points were so absorbing I was too far away in seventh heaven to notice or mind. &quot;In America&quot; is an outstanding literary achievement. It may not make easy reading but it'll repay your effort many times over. Don't miss it !	2002-01-17

It is also curiously cinematic and hence likely that some big movie studio will soon buy the rights to exploit to the full the &quot;noir-ish&quot; qualities of this eminently filmable thriller. All the elements you'd expect of a book of this genre are there - shady underground characters ranging from gangster bossmen to their threatening sidekicks, from the ambitious boss wannabee who tries too hard to the inevitable femme fatale who mysteriously disappears, etc, etc. The plot is chock full of suspense and never less than rivetting but these aren't what make MB special. The magic lies in Lethem's boldly inventive but risky way with language. That takes some courage but it works because the scatty prose pulsates to Essrog's Tourettish tics. Frank Minna and his boys may put him down and call him &quot;freakshow&quot; to his face but it's still Lionel Essrog, the underdog, who delivers and we hear ourselves rooting for him.

Each of the four segments making up CTR is a cry from the soul, which poignantly if not bitterly captures the essence of the cultural dislocation suffered by those sold to foreign lands. Some, like Nash in &quot;Pagan Coast&quot;, imbibe the Christian values of their colonial masters but experience the pull of their native calling when they are set free and returned as missionaries. Others like Martha, from &quot;West&quot;, suffer the misery, indignity and hopelessness that only chattels should know. Phillips isn't out to demonise the white man. He leaves it to us to judge. How do we doubt do-gooder Edward's sincerity in making Nash into a new man ? But then there is also skipper James Hamilton's indifference to the cruelty meted out to slaves in the title segment. The final segment &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; doesn't seem to belong but it does. The strong emotional resonance that these stories evoke is what binds them together. Phillips also displays his literary genius and stylistic versatility in using different styles for the different segments. His Conrad-influenced prose in &quot;Pagan Coast&quot; boasts some of the most beautiful and fluent writing ever. On &quot;Somewhere in England&quot;, he comes across like a contemporary novelist using prose punctuated by thought fragments. &quot;CTR&quot; brings four separate but all desperately heartrending stories together. The names of the three children - 2 boys and a girl - sold to slavery by their father in an act of desperate foolishness and named Nash, Martha and Taylor, all make their appearances. They are the countless nameless who consititute the African diaspora today. CTR is a brilliantly constructed and devastatingly powerful piece of work.

Muriel Sparks' latest novel &quot;Aiding &amp; Abetting&quot; doesn't take up much shelf space but sure proves the adage that less may be more ! This psychological thriller, based on the unsolved Lord Lucan murder mystery, is so cleverly constructed and seamlessly meshed with the subject of another true story - that of the fake stigmatic Beate Pappenheim - I found myself unable to stop until I finished it in one sitting. Sparks' ingenious plotting is once again evident in the way the pulsating narrative takes unexpected twists and turns that keeps you in total suspense with the unyielding promise of a surprise ending. I felt my heart thumping and my mind racing just watching the two Lucans and Hildegarde and their aiders connive and plot to outwit each other. The novel may have taken class as its starting point but it is blood that binds their fate. Nobody writes like Sparks these days. Her dry wit and rare economy with words make for an eloquence that is both unique and unparalleled. It is also a hallmark of great writing. &quot;Aiding &amp; Abetting&quot; may be her best work in recent times. This slim novel sure packs a wallop. It comes highly recommended.	2001-12-30

Beautifully romantic and lyrical in style and content, it recalls one of those magical realism tinged three generation family sagas so typical of Latin novelists of today. The narrator is Anna, daughter of Fantina and grandaughter of second generation patriach Davide Pittagora of Rupe, Italy. Once married to but now divorced from an Englishman, Anna lives in London but undertakes a personal project of tracing and writing her family's history by interviewing her own mother. Piecing together bits and pieces fitfully remembered and sometimes imagined by Fantina (Davide's youngest daughter), Anna's story takes us from the Pittagoras' hometown of Rupe, then briefly to their new immigrant home in New York before their final return to Italy in the 1920s. It is a colourful story, filled with memories of love, friendship, loyalty and honour but also treachery and deceipt which tainted the unrequited love affair of Rosa and her brother Davide's best friend Tommasso, and spawned the mythological duel fought between Davide and Tommasso in defence of Rosa's honour. All this is told in grandiosely sweeping style against a backdrop of political upheaval as Italy enters its Fascist period under an unnamed &quot;Leader&quot; with ambitions to dominate the world. The flow of words from Warner's pen is unmatched in the incandescent beauty it produces. &quot;Lost Father&quot; positively shimmers. Jumbled up, its poetic and dreamy sequences resemble fragments snatched from the recesses of fading memory. It is a tour de force and should not be allowed to languish on old bookshelves.

Evelyn Sert (aka Priscilla Jones) suffers an identity crisis whilst living unhappily in England. She is torn between her Englishness and her own ethnicity, so when she decides to pack her bags for Tel Aviv to make her small contribution to the Cause, she comes face to face with an uncomfortable life in a kibbutz before finally emerging in Tel Aviv, where she works as a hairdresser. It is through her surprising encounters with characters as varied and diverse as Meier, Blum, Mrs Lintz, Mackintosh and her lover Johnny - most of them leftovers from the recent historical past - that we enter the minds of the various ethnic communities (including the colonial English), some declining, others rising, but all experiencing a deep turbulence in their consciousness. Just as the English weren't shedding their colonial mentality or adjusting to their declining influence on the world stage quite so quickly enough, the German Jews who had survived the Nazi era weren't ready to shed their prejudices about the Arabs and so forth. But Grant isn't out to make a political statement. Her aim is to entertain, so what she has in store for us is an adventure story, with all the ingredients of political intrigue, spying and kidnapping, etc, as we follow Evelyn in her narrow escapades and search for her own soul and identity in her burgeoning fatherland. She tastes the complexity of it and emerges the wiser and ready to give counsel to her daughter, Naomi, who asks the same questions. Grant may have made her name as a journalist but she has proven herself to be equally adept as a novelist. She has written akeenly observed, deeply relevant and highly impressive novel that will stand the test of time. It should also make compelling reading for those like me who are keen to fill the gap in their knowledge of how it was for the Jews who built Israel. WILIMT richly deserved the Orange Prize in 2000.

When legendary trumpeter, Joss Moody, is certified &quot;female&quot; by the undertaker upon his death, his adopted son Coleman goes ballistic at his father's deception and betrayal, his widow Millicent sinks into deep mourning as she copes with her loss, while friends and colleagues express shock and disbelief but reminisce on the times when Joss revealed a softer side that could have signalled his true sex if only they had paid attention. As his wife, son and friends take turns telling the story, it becomes apparant that the truth as they perceive it is conditioned by their relationship with the famed trumpeter. Even the female journalist conspiring with Coleman's help to publish a &quot;tell all&quot; of the incredible life of Joss Moody reveals through her internal monologues insecurities which drive her need to forge a writer's relationship with her subject. The big question must be, despite the deception and a lifetime of seemingly living a lie as a person of the opposite sex, whether anyone who was an integral part of Joss' life was truly damaged by the revelation ? Can truth and love be obliterated by a biological detail ? What if the undertaker had faked it or Joss had somehow been laid to rest without anybody making the discovery ? Wasn't he a great musician, whether he was Joss or Josephine ? Kay's &quot;Trumpet&quot; made an enormous impression on me. She managed miraculously to tackle a rather strange if not unusual subject with all the emotional honesty and rectitude that the task demands without stingeing on any of the ingredients that go into the telling of a gripping and compelling tale. Once I began on it, I couldn't put it down. This is a wonderful book. Please read it.	2001-12-16
US	52572105	R2RG66Y7HZDGJJ	0679761640	476200848	The Makioka Sisters	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Japanese classic : important but less than compelling read	Junichiro Tanizaki's &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; (MK) has been hailed as a classic of postwar Japanese literature. In style and content, it resembles Naguib Mahfouz's masterpiece of Egyptian life, &quot;Palace Walk&quot;. The novel relates how the once grand Makioka family clings desperately to the past as it copes unsuccessfully with its declining fortunes and social status, and the encroaching tide of modernity. The Makioka sisters' growing desperation is evocatively captured in their endless shuttles between their beloved hometown Osaka and the increasingly dominant but alien metropolis Tokyo, and in their many failed attempts to marry off the third sister, Yukiko, which according to Japanese tradition, must precede any marriage proposal for the rebellious youngest sister, Taeko. I lost count of the number of miais the unenthusiastic Yukiko had to attend because they all ended the same way. In rejection and tears. These repetitive events that lead to dead ends give the novel a claustrophobic edge, though this has a tendency to wear the reader down. Written in flowing prose and plain narrative, MK offers a richly textured picture of a crumbling order, a society in transition as it begins to take in foreign influences ranging from western fashion to a working lifestyle for women. It is also a time of war and upheaval around the world. Non-Japanese readers may be amused by the plethora of Japanese rituals (eg, the meddling of matchmakers and the customary investigation into the social background of suitors, etc) and their stylised manner of speech and thought, but that's the way it was and to some extent is today. Osaka and Tokyo are metaphors for the old and the new. The Makiokas reveal their parochialism when they complain endlessly about the inferior lifestyle they have to suffer in Tokyo. As a family epic, MK is strangely less than compelling. The plot is static. It goes nowhere. The novel's lack of momentum may not be incongruous with its own artistic ambitions but is ultimately tedious. Characterisation is on the whole shallow, though Sachiko, the second Makioka sister through whose eyes the story is told, is pretty solid and comes to life. So does the rebellious black sheep sister, Taeko. MK is an important but not always engrossing read.	2001-12-10

It's a coup de grace and her piece de resistance. You don't need to be an afficionado of Shakespeare to appreciate the dazzling humour of Carter's story and celebration of &quot;wrong-side-of-the-trackness&quot; in a theatrical family of multigenerational twins (the Hazards) or thrill to their cross-Atlantic adventures but it'll surely heighten your sense of pleasure if you're familiar with the Bard's comic characters and able to pick them out from among the novel's fabulously diverse and colourful personalities. The novel starts on a promising note and quickly settles into a swinging groove, which Carter skillfully sustains with a momentum that just builds and builds, constantly hitting new highs just when you think it can't get any better. A diabolically clever mix of pathos and humour maintains the balance between realism and a sense of the ridiculous which is unmistakeably Carter. Her legendary tongue twisting, mind bending, linguistic pyrotechnics is in full flower and display throughout. She's in top form and those familiar with the Bard's &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Winter's Tale&quot; and &quot;Tempest&quot;, among others, will delight in the resonance that the novel's many references evoke. The denouement is also a masterful sleight of hand that is distinctively Carter. &quot;Wise Children&quot; is quite the most fascinating and entertaining novel I have read and enjoyed all year. I finished the book with such a good feeling it carried me for days. This is an &quot;absolute must&quot; for those who love contemporary literature of the finest quality. Don't miss it !	2001-11-27

The novel is a clear-eyed and devastating indictment of contemporary American society, one which has lost its moral bearings and belief in decency and truth. As the nation's morals plunge new depths witnessed by the lurid sensationalism surrounding the Clinton/Lewinsky affair, should it surprise anybody that ex-friends and colleagues of Coleman Silk should unquestioningly accept as truth the rumours and accusations - however ridiculous - hurled at him, from charges of racism to sexual debauchery with Faunia, a fallen angel and white trash ? The brutal irony is that Coleman's terrible secret, the bitter denial of his race and ethnicity to free himself from the shackles of prejudice, was finally of no avail in a society which turns a blind eye to justice in deference to cheap sensationalism. His anger, when he recognises the truth, drives him into the arms of Faunia, a damaged woman whose status as outsider and outcast, allows her the freedom to define standards of her own. Likened to a crow, she's a human scavenger and for someone like her, there's no lack of dignity in &quot;cleaning shit&quot;, if that's what she does for a living. Faunia sits at the novel's moral centre. She lights up the pages. As a character, she is incandescent and a wondrous creation of fiction. Her scene with the crows is especially memorable. So is Coleman's confrontation scene with his mother. Powerful, devastating and heartbreaking, the pain runs deep. Delphine Roux is a bit of an enigma, a little hysterical perhaps but an interesting character nevertheless. I can't say the same for Lester Farley (Faunia's war deranged husband). He is a cliche. Roth is one of the most accomplished contemporary novelists writing today. &quot;The Human Stain&quot; could be the best he's written to date. One of this year's most enjoyable reads for me.The book comes highly recommended.	2001-11-17

Her prose is clear, concise and flowing, yet never dry or prosaic. Albion Gidley Singer, the subject of &quot;Dark Places&quot;, could very easily have become a caricature, but in Grenville's expert hands, he is at once a monster for the evil he perpetrates but also a victim of his parent's grotesque upbringing methods. Brought up to despise the female species - in his eyes, soft, weak, mindless, lacking in intellect and above all, trivial - the cruelty he shows to his society wife Nora and his fat but intelligent daughter Lilian, is a front and a cover up for his own pitifully underdeveloped inner self. He surrounds himself and obsesses with facts simply because he hasn't the ability to offer an opinion or make a common human judgement on anything. Lacking a sense of humour, he is socially inept but retreats behind a picture perfect persona manufactured to fool the world. His unspeakable cruelty and crime against the rebellious Lilian marks the start of his own unrevelling. Even poor weak John finds his vocation and loosens himself from Albion's clutches. &quot;Dark Places&quot; is a fascinating study of dysfunctionality, yet there are times you feel your interest dulled by the sheer deadweight of its predictability in characterisation and its unremitting sense of doom. If not for Grenville's remarkable skills as a writer, some may even find it one dimensional and tiresome in parts. I myself enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it as a text to be studied and discussed.	2001-11-15

Strauss' story contains several conjectural elements but in his expert hands, they become the natural premise for surfacing issues of universal interest including racism, hypocrisy, love, pain, suffering and above all, truth. C &amp; E are freaks of nature. They survived as long as they did as circus exhibits to be prodded, gawked and laughed at. That they are human is often forgotten except by their wives, who even then became disenchanted with their lot. The paradox surrounding the novel is the truth that C &amp; E may look identical but can't be more different beneath the surface. Chang is humourous, quick witted, a showman but weak and eventually falls victim to alcoholism. Eng is intellectual, introverted, sensitive, but pays for a guilty secret that will torment him till his last days. This paradox takes on a different dimension considering the circumstances under which they found their spouses and gained a normal family life. There is the nagging suspicion that Adelaide and Sarah and their parents accepted C &amp; E as husbands and sons-in-law only because they were ostracised and rejected by their society for Sarah's past. The cruelty they meet in civilised America is also cleverly juxtaposed with their childhood days in barbaric Siam whose King ritually beheads dissidents for a pastime. The irony is deafening. This spellbinding tale of C &amp; E ends on a note that will break your heart. The utterance of a shattering truth that will finally provide cathartic release from heartache and pain. &quot;Chang &amp; Eng&quot; deserves all the critical praise it gets. You gotta read it !	2001-11-04

Out of print for some time, it is good to see it back on the book shelves. Those expecting jaw dropping revelations from the closet will be disappointed. There aren't any real shockers. Bawden's skill lies in weaving a modest tale of deceit, which she reveals using clues subtly planted on the canvass of a copy painting.  Common, petty deceits borne of human weaknesses and foibles that may not shatter lives instantly but as sure as night follows day work their poison given the right time and place. The painter narrator is somebody you identify with. It could just be you. His unfaithful ex-wife Helen is a testy, unhappy, and selfish woman whom you almost emphathise with. Clio, the narrator's child-wife, a cloying, whining creature, you feel like slapping. She must be the most irritating personality to have been given life on print. Then there are others like mother Maisie, aunt Maud and Ned who are so funny and each so vividly drawn they come to life on the pages. Bawden also writes like a dream. The prose that flows from her pen is smooth, witty, honest and an absolute joy to read. &quot;Circles of Deceit&quot; is a well written, tightly structured novel that will not change your life but it'll add to it.	2001-10-23

It's laden with so many weighty ideas and written in such cleverly precise and economical prose you need the patience to plough through it slowly to get its meaning. This may or may not be a put off depending on why you read fiction in the first place. For the uninitiated, the proliferation of dense techno jargo does slow down the reading somewhat but you persist because the novel's richly textured human interest is so palpably warm in its emotional resonance you don't want to give up. The love story aside, the protagonist's abandonment of a prospective career in science for literature and the devastating impact of his decision on his father is simply heartbreaking. It is also the fodder which feeds his return to U. Equally touching is witnessing how single mother Diana (Powers' colleague) courageously copes with bringing up two kids, one a near genius and the other a retard. He learnt so much from her. Finally, the experiment with building Helen, a thinking machine capable of passing the English exams, dubbed the Pygmalion experiment by critics, reveals the manifest danger of letting science assume the driver's seat. Galatea 2.2 is such a complex novel readers will almost certainly finish the last page with different ideas and conclusions of their own.	2001-10-20

All of the above	Michel Faber's &quot;Under The Skin&quot; (UTS) is an extraordinary novel, one that defies easy classification as it's got elements of suspense, horror, science fiction, and allegory all rolled into one. You're not overly concerned about giving the mixed genre its rightful name because the blend is so seamless and of such fine and captivating quality you're delirious with excitement following Isserley's adventures in her weird world of half humans and mutants. Without giving too much of the plot away and spoiling the experience for other readers, let's just say that UTS isn't what you think it is.  Your jaw drops a few degrees with each revelation.  In daring to be experimental, Faber's flirts with the bizarre and pushes the boundaries of disbelief to extremities without causing the novel to capsize, lose its balance or coherence. The hitchhikers Isserley pick up are &quot;vodsels&quot;. So are the others who live in the &quot;Estate&quot;. Are they of the same species ? Who knows ? Isserley's bitterness at her own condition, the outcome of a sacrifice she apparently had no choice but to accept, is contrasted with the naivety of the privileged and sheltered Amlis Vess. The moral centre of the novel rises to the surface in the beautifully felt and heartbreaking encounter between these two. Faber was evidently inspired by and borrowed from the scene between Miranda and Caliban in William Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot;. But there is nothing derivative about UTS. It's a rare original, and one infused with a strange and incandescent beauty that's endowed by Faber's economical yet articulate prose. I have a feeling its appeal will endure. One of the best reads this year. I can't recommend it highly enough.	2001-10-17
US	52572105	RGWW4XANRL76W	0385720467	133960389	Disobedience: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Promising but didn't quite deliver	Jane Hamilton has been compared with other female novelists like Anne Tyler and Jane Smiley who write in the same vein and specialize in overblown domestic dramas.  &quot;Disobedience&quot; falls neatly into this category but it's family drama writ small. The premise for the novel appears promising. Henry, teenage son of Kevin and Elizabeth Shaw and brother of tomboy younger sister Elvira, stumbles upon his mother's adultery with fellow musician, Richard Polloco, whilst accidentally reading her emails one day. He recoils and spends the rest of the novel stewing in helpless horror at his mother's betrayal. He's seized by inaction not because he's a wimp - though there are moments you feel like giving him a good shake - but because he's half child, half grownup and cannot quite make emotional sense or carry the lonely burden of his awful discovery. His mental distress and confusion is evidenced throughout by the multiple identities he has created for his mother - she is referred to often in the same paragraph if not the same sentence as Elizabeth, Mrs Shaw, or Liza (her email nickname). He even imagines she was his warring spouse in his former life. While it's hard to quarrel with the smooth, intimate prose flowing from Hamilton's expert pen, &quot;Disobedience&quot; falters on its poor characterization and inattention to plot details which strain credibility. The latter first. It's hard to imagine Elizabeth not taking basic precautions with her email access when she is carrying on this torrid online affair with Richard she's trying to keep secret ? A more serious criticism is Hamilton's less than convincing conceptualization of the Henry character. She never quite got into his head. His response just seems odd for a teenage boy.  Elizabeth, I found unsympathetic and irritating. Hamilton is rather more successful with Kevin. He's the cerebral, head in the clouds type who is simultaneously a godsent parent to Elvira as well as the emotionally distant if not spaced outhusband who has driven his wife up the wall and into the arms of Richard. We're ambivalent about him but that's fine. However, &quot;Disobedience&quot; is saved from total failure by Elvira, the eccentric tomboy sister of uncertain sexual persuasion who is obsessed with the reenactment of the Civil War, but also the novel's one character you really care about. She's a lively invention who lights up the pages and brings a big smile to my face whenever she appears. Hamilton would have had a more successful novel in her hands had she made Elvira the subject of her novel. Maybe she should, as a sequel to this. &quot;Disobedience&quot; begins promisingly, then finds itself stuck in a groove for nearly two thirds of its length, but ends with the aftermath of a dramatic episode that leaves you with the funny feeling that dysfunctionality still lurks beneath the surface and could rear its ugly ahead should Hamilton decide to write her next instalment on the Shaws. My recommendation is, &quot;forget about Henry, concentrate on Elvira, you've got a heroine in her&quot;.	2001-10-05

Writing in a different vein, Lanchester's sophomore effort is an astounding work of pure craft and genius. A day in the life of an accountant who has been told he's fired but his wife doesn't yet know. He leaves home at the<BR>usual time the next day but instead of heading for the office, spends the day wandering about town observing the movement of normal human traffic and figuring out the statistical probability of conventionally held beliefs about normal human activity including how often people have sex, meet with accidents, etc. Before the day is through, he would have had a few strange<BR>encounters with unlikely social specimens, watched a pornographic movie in Soho, London, stalked a favourite TV personality he spotted in Chelsea and been caught in a bank hold up. All this may sound quite inane and absurd but it isn't remotely. In losing his job, Mr Phillips also loses his bearings. As his defence mechanism goes into frantic overdrive, he starts playing mind games with himself. He tries desperately to recreate a new reality to define and validate his own existence. An equilibrium of sorts restores him to the world by the time he makes it back home. Maybe now he can tell his wife. I loved &quot;Mr Phillips&quot; because Lanchester has chosen for his subject an area of our subconscious we're all secretly familiar with but never<BR>thought somebody would unrevel on paper with such incredible lucidity, poise, humour and finesse.

Based on the childhood memories of youngest daughter, Dolores, the story is told in a jerky sequence that flits in short spurts (albeit seamlessly) between past and present, using images and details of recollection that resemble shards of broken glass from a fragmented past. Azzopardi paces the novel expertly, the gathering momentum keeping the reader engrossed as he tries to re-order the ever shifting mosaic of an imperfectly remembered past. So, it takes nearly all of 282 pages for a not quite complete picture of how it really was for Mary and the girls to be unveiled....but to register relief at being handed the truth is surely to miss the point. Celeste, Rose, Fran and Luca, given the chance, would have their own stories to tell. Celeste, the eldest, who willed herself into accepting an arranged marriage to an old widower, would be surprised to find herself portrayed as a self centred, conceited snob when the sisters meet after years of separation at their mother's funeral. It is surely also a testimony of the strength and success of Azzopardi's characterisation that we should have a confident dual appreciation of the characters. The loyal Salvador, big hearted Eva, and fire loving oddball sister Fran, are gorgeous creations of humanity. While there are no happy endings for the damaged lives that must carry on, the author pulls a lovely surprise at the every end when the one character you wonder and care about finally arrives to complete the reunion. I finished the book with a big smile on my face. What a rare treat !	2001-09-27

The opening chapter describing an industrial town in an advanced stage of disintegration and the destruction wreaked upon the lives of its inhabitants must be the most desolate scene ever to have been conjured and committed to print in a long time. What an intro. The protagonist Bill's ice trade family background is also a masterstroke of irony and genius on the part of Collins considering that he's writing about a dust filled parched out landscape full of weary people with sweat stains in the armpits of their shirts, sour bile in their mouths, and swigging mugs of ice cold beer all day to overcome the oppressive heat. The eventual capitulation of the editorial team of the town daily, &quot;The Truth&quot;, which leads to its demise, nails with deadly accuracy the spirit of the times, of the losing battle waged by traditional print media against the immediacy of television. The elevation of Ronnie, the murder suspect, by the town's youth to media hero status, is as ridiculous as it is unnerving. What chance does the Sam, Ed and Bill team have against the glamourous Linda Carter, who's always first on the scene with the latest and the hottest ? It seems like nobody living in the community is spared the overwhelming sense of displacement following the end to an old way of life. Bill, scarred from the memory of the suicide of his father, is arguably as strung out as his newspaper colleagues, Sam and Ed, or even the diabolical Ronnie, whose torment is so palpable and real I couldn't help but shed a tear for him. He goes out metaphorically on an unutterable cry of despair. There are no winners in this tale. Only losers. Though dubbed a murder mystery, the most frightening moments weren't about the sliced finger or rotting head of the decapitated victim, but the revelation of the unshakeable solidarity and determination among the town's womenfolk led by Darlene to protect the devastating secret of Ronnie's estranged. More irony ? The men's morale collapse but the women remain steadfast to the very end. KOT is an accomplished and astounding piece of work, certainly among the best that contemporary literature has to offer and Collins is such a major writing talent I can't wait to read what he has next in store for us. Yes, KOT deserves nothing less than a five star rating. Don't miss it !	2001-09-13

Notwithstanding, what we have in &quot;White Teeth&quot; is an impressive and stunningly mature piece of work from a precocious new talent who writes likes she's already lived a hundred years, ingested the entire social and cultural history of mankind and applied those influences to create a wonderfully fresh new novel about multigenerational conflicts within immigrant families in England. There are even touches of the great Rushdie in this hilarious yet absorbing and relevant tale of racial, sexual, social and cultural confusion that now pervades the proverbial &quot;green and pleasant land&quot;.  There are many rivers and tributaries feeding into the soil of multicultural England. East Indians (Pakistan), West Indians (Jamaicans), you name them, they're there. What's fascinating about this explosion of influences coming from all sides including the host culture is the capacity they create for the unexpected.  Nothing is what they seem. The wilful retreat of Samad into eastern conservatism, the clear eyed revolt of his wife, Alsana, who wishes to annihilate all references to her own motherland, the opposite natures of their twin boys, Magid and Millat, and the mindboggling paths they took towards their destinies, etc is the stuff of great fiction. I also loved the characterisation of the obsessive Chalfens, whose eccentricity is uniquely English.  Joyce is an absolute scream. The novel just builds and builds.  It never flags and indeed ends on a big note. Smith's language is quite simply dazzling but also occasionally overworked. That's when you develop a mild headache but it's a small criticism. &quot;White Teeth&quot; is such a massively enjoyable piece of fiction it will entrance readers for years to come. The second novel will be the big test but if Zadie Smith continues to produce novels of this quality and standard, she will soon find herself ensconced among the pantheon of great contemporary writers.  Believe the hype. This novel is epic in breadth and sweep. Don't miss it. For once, the critics got it right.	2001-09-03

Her taste for torrid themes, in particular the brutal and bizarre, are well known. &quot;Expensive People&quot;, one of her early works, starts off with a bang. A more direct opening you'll not find. The scene is set. You're instantly captivated and as she reels you in, you succumb and immediately find yourself in Richard Everett's head as he unveils his life story to you...bit by bit. You know you're dealing with dysfunctionality as soon as you meet his parents.  There's a seething madness underneath just waiting to get out.  If the medium were film, you'll see them cast in grainy black and white. But it isn't. Sad to say, the book loses momentum midway and it becomes tedious. You keep waiting for something to happen and when it does, it's anticlimactic. In the words of Richard, life isn't fiction. Nor is it half as dramatic. Oates is a colourful and engaging writer. She's got craft but has a tendency to indulge herself and when she does, she loses focus. &quot;Expensive People&quot; isn't a conventional thriller. It's a social critique of American society at the turn of the 60s decade and about the falseness of respectable society on the brink of a social revolution that will forever shatter time tested norms.  While flawed and not entirely satisfying, it's an impressive early work and Oates got much better by the time she wrote Black Water.	2001-09-03

The western reader may find some of it culturally alien and difficult to understand, but Asians should be familiar and quite easily identify with the characteristics of conservative patriachal societies. The seemingly two-faced tendency of the novel's patriach (he's the admired successful businessman on the outside but the family tyrant at home) isn't really tantamount to hyprocrisy, though it's tempting to label him a hypocrite for exhibiting double standards. His subservient wife, Amina, may be a doormat by our reckoning but she has the emotional ballast to keep the family afloat through the most trying of times. And so on. This sweeping family saga addresses the issues of male supremacy, female subservience, double standards, courage, conviction, change and renewal. It is about a society undergoing a quiet revolution. The imperialist forces that threaten to break down the fabric of feudal Egyptian society also release pent up feelings of rage and dissent as evidenced by the growing revolt among the young against the ruling order. Consider Fahmy's new found courage, patriotism and sacrifice, Yasim's wife's outrage against her husband's debauchery, the open display of Maryam's love for the soldier, etc. Even the patriach undergoes a makeover of sorts at the end. The novel opens on a quietly intimate note, then reaches an early climax when Amina is thrown out of her home for daring to venture out of her cloisters. Contrast this with the winds of change sweeping across the social landscape with each passing decade. Two minor complaints. The novel ends too abruptly, thus anticipating a sequel. Those unfamiliar with the historical background may find some of it puzzling (eg, the constant reference to the obviously unwelcome encroachment of Australian soldiers).

So, it shouldn't surprise us to find the narrator and his friends coping with their own sexual condition as a malady, each unconsciously but surely searching for a cure to restore himself to the mainstream. Indeed, with parents like the unnamed narrator's, who can blame them for developing a complex ? The protagonist worries that he isn't thin or handsome enough. His friend, Sean, suspects he isn't intelligent enough. Even Maria, the jokey intellectual, finds herself on shaky grounds, flitting from being a radical activist one day and a sloganeering feminist the next. She only lets her mask slip when she falls briefly in love with Maeve. What's clear is that despite the honesty they uphold with each other, they're in denial over their &quot;condition&quot;. That's why the spectacle of young gay males lining up at public toilets (even school toilets) to indulge their fetish is both sad and funny. That's also why there's an unmistakably celebratory feel about the coming out of the narrator's sister during more progressive times. In her own words, &quot;there's nothing secure about suffering&quot;. The novel ends on a pregnant note of expectation, with the uprising at Stonewall Tavern marking the beginning of the gay movement to gain political rights for itself as a minority group. White is both humourous and serious and his intimate understanding of the subject lends a special authenticity to his writing. &quot;The Beautiful Room Is Empty&quot; may be the second of a three part trilogy but it succeeds well enough on its own. I haven't read either the prequel or sequel but those who have seem to find it even better.	2001-08-15

The feeling of displacement or alienation suffered by Dr Hata, first as an adopted child in a Japanese household and later as an alien intruder into American society, is mirrored in his turbulent years bringing up his own adopted daughter, Sunny, whose ingratitude and hostility seems inexplicable but is ultimately rooted in the same cause.  His sense of not belonging has denied him the confidence to develop any real relationships with people around him. His tentative friendship and courtship of the widow, Mary Burns, evocatively detailed, is filled with wry regret and unfulfillment. He is scarred by his surprising but tragic war time love affair with the young comfort woman (K) but also learns from the experience the devastating truth of the most cruel discrimination visited upon Korean immigrants who have settled in Japan but continued to be regarded as aliens by their hosts. Hence, his retreat into polite civilian life in America after the war and content with being merely an observer, always on the outside looking in but never quite participating or engaging. He avoids surprises, choosing a life of routine of work and daily exercise. It is only through the persistent attempt by decent people like Liv and Renny to reach out to him that finally restores his confidence in building long lasting relationships.  The union between these not-so-young younger folks is a poignant reminder of how it might have been between Dr Hata and Mary. Lee manages the time shift between past and present congruously. Whilst the war time episode is by far the more dramatic, it is the present day panning out of Dr Hata's life in his adoptive community that is the more revealing and satisfying. Lee is a tremendously gifted writer. His prose is smooth as silk and flows so naturally you feel yourself riding the emotional waves with Dr Hata. &quot;A Gesture Life&quot; is a wonderful second novel from Lee and one that I would recommend without hesitation to anyone who loves good literature. A remarkable literary achievement.	2001-08-02

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Wicked funny black comedy : best in its genre	Jonathan Coe's \\"The Winshaw Legacy\\" is a wickedly funny black comedy of the very first order. It's a satire which lampoons the \\"greed is good\\" ethics of Thatcherite England using a cast of third generation Winshaws who must seem like the vilest human specimens ever to have inhabited planet earth. They are all beyond redemption, from media superbitch Hilary, to art enthusiast and scoundrel Roddy, merchant banker with a secret fetish Thomas, shamelessly two-faced politician Henry, dirty dealing Mark and agricultural businesswoman and philistine, Dorothy. They are their parents' progeny. No doubt about it. It leaves Aunt Tabitha, the mad and odd one out among the second generation Winshaws, to commission the settling of a long held but hushed up family secret.  The detective work is carried out by the narrator whose own peculiar past sets him up for the undertaking. The Winshaws are all drawn up in bloated pop colour proportions it's clear we're not expected to take them seriously as characters.  The last section of the novel may seem awfully predictable (\\"paint-by-numbers\\" you think in your head) but it's OK because we're watching a spoof and a spoof made all the more wonderful because it's so incredibly funny. Henry's hilarious television interview and Dorothy's gruesome cost saving methods in chicken farming are just two episodes that stick to your mind. Aunt Tabitha looms in the background like a witch but when she shows up, she lights up the pages.  Coe's writing is consistently first rate, deliciously wicked and thoroughly enjoyable. His humour is always well timed and spot on in its execution. \\"The Winshaw Legacy\\" is an stupendous piece of work that will appeal to readers of both serious fiction and detective thrillers. Don't miss it !	2001-07-29
US	52572105	R1OGHT8GTQ7MUK	0374140243	550414805	A Disaffection	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Reads like you're living in somebody's head	I guess there's no easy way into a James Kelman novel. He is not the most accessible of writers to non-native readers because he uses the language of the vernacular to capture the essence of daily thought and speech patterns of the Scottish working class. Authentic it may well be, this style of writing is nevertheless limiting in its readership appeal. Thus, it was with some reservation that I began on &quot;A Disaffection&quot;, my first Kelman novel. After stumbling around a bit with familiar looking words spelled funny and expletives that scream at you from nearly every line, I got into a rhythmn and found myself on the way to a strange journey that's not without its appeal. Kelman's stream of consciousness style means that we stay very much within the confines of our hero Patrick Doyle's mind. Nothing much happens but that's the point. Pat is a university graduate from a working class background, who hates and despises his job as a teacher, believes he is polluting the minds of the children he teaches with useless capitalist thoughts, secretly falls for Alison, a fellow teacher who's married, but is too scared to declare his intentions, and ends up being transferred to another school but cannot remember having asked for the transfer. It's bad enough that he's paralysed by inaction, his elder brother, Gavin, an unemployed builder, harbours a secret resentment against Pat for being the educated one in the family, not realising his lonely plight. The novel begins with two sets of pipes that Pat finds at the back of the Arts Club, intending to use as musical instruments. He never gets round to it.  That's the story of his life. The pipes are a symbol of his private ambitions. They are painted and shiny but he never gets round to playing them at the nightclub after work. &quot;A Disaffection&quot; is remorseless in its pessimism and criticism of the state of  Scottish society but it's also infused with so much good humour and honesty you leave the embattled scene notnecessarily unscarred but alive. My first taste of Kelman may have been fraught with some initial difficulties but you get the hang of it and the final verdict is a thumbs up.	2001-07-19

The three generation family drama at the heart of this deceptively slight novel may not set any sparks flying but chances are you'd still be thinking of it long after the story has ended and settled into a warm afterglow. Toibin is an unflashy writer. He aims straight for your heart and succeeds in a disarmingly off-the-cuff way. The opening chapters have a luminous quality about them that sets the tone for Helen's subsequent encounter with her mother (Lily) and grandmother (Dora). The event that brings three generations of feuding mothers and daughters together is Declan's terminal illness from AIDS. In caring for and trying to make peace with the dying Declan, they resolve their differences with each other in a chillingly unsentimental and cold eyed manner.  Ironically, the characterisation of the three women at the centre of Toibin's novel are a little weak and indistinct compared to Paul and Larry (Declan's friends) who spring to life as the story unfolds. Declan, however, remains little more than a catalyst. His part is curiously underwritten. Tuskar Rock and Blackwater Lightship, two lighthouses out at sea, one still working, the other not, are deeply symbolic of the choices facing the feuding family members. They can either decide to close the chapter and get on with their lives or continue to nurse their wounds privately and watch them fester. The recurring image of the landslide eating into their neighbour's house is also a powerful metaphor for the corrosion of family relationships.  &quot;Blackwater Lightship&quot; is a sensitive and quietly enduring piece of work that will surely touch you. The final chapters including an unlikely one with Helen and Paul baring their souls to each other, are absolutely devastating. This is literary fiction of the finest quality that deserves to be read. Not to be missed.	2001-07-17

It's also seldom that the movie is better than the book, so it's doubly disappointing that Oscar Hijuelos' much lauded &quot;The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love (MKPSOL)&quot; should prove to be such a shallow, shabby and one dimensional affair. The novel's premise hold much promise - tale of two Cuban brothers who work at a meat packing plant by day but transform into gilded musicians in a band by night - but the execution is surprisingly amateurish. Characterisation is poor - both Cesar and Nestor seem like caricatures (the extrovert/hunk and the introvert/dreamer) rather than rounded or believable characters. We never truly understand their psyche but then we don't really care because we can't relate to them anyway. The graphic sex scenes that litter the novel keep repeating every three pages or so. They are not an affront to good taste - we are not prudes - but cheapen the reading experience. The plot also suffers from a lack of  dramatic momentum. The storyline stalls some place midway, becomes quickly boring and repetitive and degenerates into a one note samba. Hijuelos' prose may be straightforward, easy on the eyes, easy on the brains but curiously flat and pulp fiction like. Only the Desi Arnaz episode manages to lift MKPSOL from its low aim by showing the funny side to the American psyche - always ready to be star struck. MKPSOL makes for a light entertaining (albeit over long) read but it hasn't remotely the literary qualities worthy of its Pulitzer Prize winning status. I can't imagine it surviving as serious literature for the ages. If you want to read a good book by a Cuban or similar writer, go for either Christina Garcia or Julia Alvarez.	2001-07-13
US	52572105	R2W8AHY4FAMS25	0060915544	842706595	The Bean Trees	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A beautifully life affirming and uplifting novel	Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful novelist, honest and truthful in her observations and compassionate in the treatment of her subjects. She is also extremely funny and had me doubled up in stitches at the most unexpected moments. When she writes about social injustice, colonial prejudice or racial discrimination as she does in &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; (&quot;BT&quot;), she is disarmingly understated and all the more slyly suggestive and powerful in her delivery. BT, her debut novel, is a beautifully conceived little gem that will warm the cockles of your heart.  As soon as Taylor drives off in her weatherbeaten car in search of a life and headed for nowhere, she find herself landed with an abandoned child of Indian (native) origin whom she names Turtle and with her in tow embarks on a journey of self discovery.  As she travels in search of work and accommodation, she strikes up a friendship with a group of people including the bighearted Mattie, the mousy worrier and some time single mother Lou Ann, and the troubled Cherokee Indian couple, Estevan and Esperanza, who has lost their child. Not surprisingly, Turtle becomes a natural catalyst for the emotional catharsis they will each experience as their lives entwine, separate and unfold. In their own ways, they are transformed and healed by their friendship which has taught them what it means to be human. As the plot unrevels, you realize that there are just no stereotypes to humanity, the motto being &quot;we should always be ready to be surprised&quot;. How else would you explain the role reversal in the positions of the confident Taylor and the insecure Lou Ann by the end of the novel ? Kingsolver's multiple name identities for her characters (eg, Estevan/Steven, Esperanza/Hope, Marietta/Taylor, etc) is also a subconcious metaphor for the myriad realities of life. I loved Kingsolver's balanced and finely judged prose, which has a steady clarity and lucidity about it that reaches its peak in the chapter about nature and the elements, preceding the telling of the terrible incident that set Turtle's recovery back. Kingsolver is obviously knowledgeable about botany and vegetation because she uses her expert knowledge to great effect. BT is serious, yet incredibly funny and life affirming in its values. I found reading it a thoroughly entertaining and uplifting experience and I highly recommend it to anybody who loves excellent and unpretentious writing.	2001-06-27
US	52572105	R3SO5CEZ04EVM2	0679721827	687597039	The Fifth Child	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Not an ordinary horror story after all	&quot;The Fifth Child&quot; isn't a typical Doris Lessing novel. There's none of the bleak introspection you might expect if you're familiar with her other more famous works. Here, she tackles the horror story genre for the first time and shows what an incredibly versatile and talented writer she is. The narrative is linear and the storyline straightforward. The prose is clear and uncluttered. The life of Harriet and David Lovatt from the time they meet at an office party to their shattered twilight years as they watch with horror their changeling child grow is told in a single rolling sequence unbroken by chapters, the effect of which is to focus with merciless clarity on the phenomenon of Ben and his pernicious influence of destruction on the Lovatt family and clan. It may be tempting to see Harriet and David as an ordinary couple caught in this weird, near supernatural conundrum but in typical Lessing fashion, she seems almost to suggest to the reader (this reader, at least) that Ben might be their just punishment for so irresponsibly burdening themselves with such a big house and breeding like rabbits when their finances won't allow it, yet using emotional blackmail to live off the love, goodwill and charity of their parents - David's father (James) provides the cash while Harriet's mother (Dorothy) becomes the resident slave. Read in this light, &quot;The Fifth Child&quot; isn't just a domestic horror story but becomes a different entity altogether. A kind of morality play, perhaps. Quite clearly, Lessing had planned on a sequel. The novel closes almost too abruptly, leaving several loose ends untied. Like &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; anticipates &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Child&quot; anticipates &quot;Ben&quot;. It's a scary, creepy but thoroughly engaging and thought provoking novel. Lessing is in great form throughout and I'd be looking forward to reading the sequel....if the reviews weren't so lukewarm.	2001-06-15

No two ways about it. It's a dark, complex, and difficult piece of work and not easy to digest unless you have a modicum of knowledge of Japanese socio-economic history. The spirit of revival of the feudal uprising of 1860 is the central motif that renders the dialectical relationship and the unspeakable horror visited upon the two Nedokoro brothers, Mitsu and Takashi,  ultimately comprehensible. While radical younger brother Takashi needs to relive the heroic (real or imagined) past of his great granduncle to bring a measure of validity to his own existence, older brother Mitsu's life crumbles when he sires a horribly retarded child whom he institutionalizes and then fails to come to terms with the ritualistic suicide of his best friend. So does Mitsu's marriage to his wife, Natsumi, who takes to the bottle and appears headed for disaster until brother-in-law Takashi imbues her with fire and converts her to his cause. But there's no happy ending and she's cruelly let down. Takashi's rabid vendetta against the Emperor, the Korean supermarketeer, and his cruelty towards his disciples is a perversion in his search for truth. Mitsu's inability to break out of his self imposed inner exile, his refusal to connect with the past and his corrosive negativism poisons everything about him, including his marriage to Natsumi, which is wryly but painfully observed.  Oe employs the imagery of the dark encroaching forest over the valley to evoke a dangerous sense of foreboding that builds to a shattering climax when shocking family secrets are revealed but there's no relief, forgiveness or healing in the aftermath.  Nevertheless, Oe avoids an entirely downbeat ending by pulling off a stunning surprise that forces Mitsu to re-examine and give his life another go. The ritualistic suicide of Mitsu's friend is the dramatic manifestation of the &quot;silent cry&quot; of truth he finds unutterable. At another level, &quot;The Silent Cry&quot; can be read as a study of an insular nation coping with the rising tide of foreign influences that threatens the old way of life. It's incredibly rich in its treatment of a universal theme that will guarantee its relevance forever. Oe writes with a rare intensity that perfectly captures the strangeness and beauty of the Japanese psyche. It's an awesome landmark of a novel that no serious lover of literature can afford to miss. Some may find &quot;The Silent Cry&quot; a  dark and disturbing piece of work. Perhaps it is. But it's essential reading.	2001-06-12

This is a coming-of-age tale of young Jeanette who outgrows the religious fanaticism of her adoptive family to discover her own wayward sexuality in small town England. In my opinion, OINTOF could have been a more confident and intimate piece of work if Winterson hadn't used a tone of voice or style that tended towards caricature than realism. The people who made her growing up years such a horror - especially her mother and the priest - are so demented you can't quite take them seriously. Maybe they are genuine nutcases. Certainly, Jeanette saw them that way. Maybe it's down to Winterson's style which is inherently quaint and quirky, but by painting the landscape this shade of purple, she creates a strangely distancing effect that negates the heartbreak and poignance that lies beneath. The use of fables to break up the narrative is also a technique that doesn't work for me.  They interrupt the flow, confuse and obscure rather than enlighten or add to the overall effect. I don't mean to pan the book because I rather enjoyed it. I just felt it could be better.	2001-06-02

His multiple award winning novel, &quot;The Great World&quot;,  is a coming-of-age tale of lost innocence of two lads (Digger and Vic) whose separate childhoods in the outbacks of Australia and their shared experiences as interns in the Second World War helped shape the course of their future together. It's difficult to characterise the relationship these two men have with each other. To call it friendship would be to simultaneously overstate and understate the position. They were never really buddies - hell, Digger didn't even like Vic - but fate had different ideas and kept intervening at critical moments to draw them together whenever their lives took separate turns after the war. Of the two, Vic is the more colourful and vividly drawn character.  The early rejection of his natural father - a weak and sorry piece of low life - and his obsessive need for self determination provide more than a clue to our impression of him as a steely hearted &quot;user&quot; (of Digger, his adoptive family, etc) of family and friends for his own ends. The sad irony is that Vic is as much a victim as the people he uses and only his wife, Ellie, is privileged and burdened by knowledge of the truth when she catches a glimpse of his real self in the dark. More disappointment follows when his son Greg turns out to be a sloganeering liberal. Digger, on the other hand, is arguably the novel's moral centre but as a character, he seems curiously underwritten. His part is that of the moon to Vic's sun. He possesses a vulnerability that is simply incandescent. Even Jenny, his retarded sister, sees through Vic, but Digger remains trusting and accepting to the end. But &quot;The Great World&quot; is far from a two man show. There are loads more characters that Malouf creates who are truly memorable. Mac, their war time mate, may have been given limited script space, but his spirit lives on long after he has been written out.  It's also a wonderfully uplifting moment for the reader when  Pa and Ma, Vic's adoptive parents, find their true vocation in life as poet and businesswoman, respectively. Malouf is a classic writer in the best of the old fashioned tradition. He knows how to tell a story and keep you enthralled from start to finish. His prose is warm, accessible and true. Reading &quot;The Great World&quot; may not change your life but it will show you what it is to be human. A great novel. I highly recommend it.	2001-05-25

It's a shame it didn't enjoy more widespread recognition as a major and enduring literary work than it did. I've read many award winning contemporary novels these past two years but few have been as engaging and satisfying. Despite its topically controversial subject of the &quot;Cambridge spies&quot;, Banville eschews cheap and tabloidy sensationalism in favour of a subtle and intimate approach to the unrevelling of the minds and motivation of a small group of intellectuals who betrayed England by passing state secrets to Russia. When their treachery was made public, the shock was compounded by the fact that the last of these spies to have been exposed (renamed Victor Maskell) was not some hip lefty but an art historian personally as well as professionally close to the Royal Family. But what emerges from this poignant and fictionalised treatment of the scandal and Victor Maskell's psyche is the realisation that these acts of treachery were probably committed for reasons that had little to do with ideology but with a desperate need to satisfy a hidden longing. Remember, the Soviet cause never took hold of Victor after an early visit to Russia which totally disenchanted him. But he secretly revelled in the furtive recruitment interviews and the risk of being caught as it provided relief and outlet for his (unconsciously) unhappy existence as a repressed homosexual. To all appearances, he was a family man but there is no trace of fatherliness in his relationship or feelings towards his adult children. The reader isn't spared a tragic ending and Banville's restraint only heightens the pain. &quot;The Untouchable&quot; makes a truly compelling read because Banville's writing is elegant, smart, humourous, subtle and hits you in between the eyes. His prose is never pretentious, always accessible and smooth as silk. This is an outstanding novel that should havemade it to the Booker Prize shortlist. I'd give it a 6-star rating if I could. Read it.	2001-05-16

On each of these visits, the grand matriach would open up her suitcase of relics from her French past and hold the teenager and his sister spellbound with fascinating stories of public figures and larger than life personalities. While these influences no doubt help him connect and make sense of his bicultural heritage, they also set him apart from his schoolmates and creates obstacles to his coming to terms with reality. This &quot;double vision&quot; effect, picturesquely depicted in his two framed view of the naked lady in the ship, causes him discomfort and for a time, he rails against it. But he finally understands that dreams and memories conjured by imagination and recollection is not necessarily the enemy of factual history and knowledge as they add to the appreciation of the soul of a nation. Memories of pomp and drama in the life of past presidents and their mistresses is as valid to the appreciation of one's history as the march of poor, tired and anonymous old soldiers in war. The grand matriach Charlotte's life echoes with the history of France and Russia. She has lived through much and endured more than most of us would ever have dreamed possible. Her secrets take most of the novel to unfold. Makine's prose is richly lyrical but always accessible and coherent. It is also restrained yet emotional. I enjoyed the book immensely but found the last section a little unfocussed and disappointing. Hence, my 4-star rating for this 5-star novel.	2001-05-13
US	52572105	R2HYDL6PWDBUX8	0140108513	290998376	Love (King Penguin)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Gothic love triangle	It's hard to pidgeonhole Angela Carter's &quot;Love&quot; into a specific genre. It has all the elements of a  melodrama - love, sex, madness, violence, even a hint of incest - but the entity created by the talented Carter isn't remotely the cheap and tawdry sexploitation feast you might expect from such seemingly unpromising material. If I had to categorise this slyly mythical tale of a deadly love triangle between/among two half brothers, Lee and Buzz (one blonde and fair, the other dark with traces of foreign blood) and a girl, I'd call it a gothic love story.  With great skill, Carter quickly sets the tone for the novel with an opening scene that is simply unforgettable. The picture of Annabel, crouching in the dark under the open skies, is an early hint that the cosmic powers will play their part in shaping the lives of our three protagonists. Carter seems to like writing about lowlife in 60s England - her debut novel &quot;Shadow Dance&quot; is another example - but in &quot;Love&quot;, she gives the subject an off centred spin to create something unique. You'd be hard pressed to find a sympathetic character in this chilling but compact short story. They're nearly all dirty, scruffy, drunk and vile. Annabel's parents don't count because they're middle class and even they're helpless in saving their daughter. The waif like Annabel (shades of Ophelia) isn't the victim you think she is. Mentally frail and otherworldly to the point of self absorption, she has no real grasp of reality and wreaks havoc on the lives of the menfolk around her. The gorgeously written tattoo scene is especially memorable and symbolic of the nature of her relationship with Lee. It's all about possession and control, aspects of love which the brothers have no ability to respond to or cope with. You know that it can only lead to tragedy. Haunted by the memory of their mother who lost her mind and gave them over to the care of their aunt, Lee and Buzz are as debauched as their friends and as out of control as Annabel. Carter is an incredibly gifted writer. Her prose is imaginative, colourful and sparkling and always a pleasure to read. This book is a wonderful read. It comes highly recommended.	2001-05-11
US	52572105	R39N5R1RVQZBAC	0156007754	787923440	Blindness (Harvest Book)	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Back to basics with humanity	Nobel Prize winning novelist Jose Saramago's &quot;Blindness&quot; is a powerful and devastating piece of work. It is a pitiless examination under microscopic scrutiny of humanity which has forgotten its own nature but rediscovers itself only when deprived of the sensory power of sight. A sudden outbreak of  blindness known as &quot;white evil&quot; infects one person, then another and so on and before long, the asylum where the government decides to quarantine those afflicted to contain the spread of this mysterious disease finds itself unable to accomodate, clean and feed a ceaseless torrent of new patients. That's the perfect set up for strange things to happen because in the kingdom of the newly blind, its inhabitants find themselves in unfamiliar territory and come face to face with their own humanity, with surprising results. The filth, poverty and decay and the total transformation of this unidentified place into a desolate wasteland is told in horrific detail. There is no scene more chilling than that of a company chairman on his way to a Board meeting but never arriving because the elevator he is travelling in suddenly stalls on the way up. The &quot;dog of tears&quot; joining the party of blind inmates as they flee from the fire gutting the asylum is also a brilliant creation, reminding us that we are not very different from animals when even they can shed tears for us. It is appropriate that Saramago's characters should remain nameless throughout and are identified only by their physical attributes. Does anonymity matter when identity ceases to exist without the power of sight ? Except for one, the doctor's wife, who pretends to be blind to be with her husband. Ironically and tragically, she suffers much, much more than the others because she can see. It is pivotal to Saramago's allegorical tale that there should be a witness to the carnage. How else are we, the readers, to believe that all he has told us has taken place ? Without sight, what do we know ?&quot;Blindness&quot; ranks among the best of contemporary literature. It is a rich and masterfully executed piece of work. Highly recommended.	2001-05-03
US	52572105	R3BMASAO7TXKPH	0805055800	129665449	A Crime in the Neighborhood	Books	5	2	4	N	N	A wonderfully enjoyable and memorable first novel	There's nothing deep or pretentious about Suzanne Berne's first novel, &quot;A Crime In The Neighbourhood&quot;. At first glance, it may not even read like &quot;literary fiction&quot; if to qualify a novel has to be chock full of abstract elements or important themes and ideas. But serious fiction it is, because Berne has produced a deceptively easy to read and wonderfully entertaining first novel about childhood memory of loss, guilt, alienation and pain. ACITN isn't a who-dunnit. The boy's murder isn't even central to the novel's purpose. It may be an emblem for the sign of the times and of change rippling through America in 1972. Washington neighbourhoods would never be as safe again just as the American national consciousness lost and would never regain its innocence after Watergate. But the murder was also the perfect occasion and excuse for members of a dysfunctional family to manifest their repression and hurt in ways that brought calamity to others, notably Mr Green, the loner whose non-conformity made him a natural target for suspicion. Long after the incident, the narrator (Marsha) looks back with horror but understanding of what she had done. When her father left his family with her aunt (Ada) one day, it altered the standing of her family among neighbours. When a search party was organised to look for the missing boy, Marsha and her siblings felt excluded as they didn't have a man in their house to join in the search. The sense of alienation most affected Marsha and her mother (Lois) leading to tensions that would finally explode and seek release in ways bordering on perversity. Mr Green's final &quot;why ?&quot; to the 10-year old Marsha would be answered several years later when as an adult she poses the same question back to her father. The scene of Mr Green's failed barbeque party ending with Lois' blurted confession to her host is one of the most painful scenes ever to have been committed to the written page. Berne writes like a dream. Her prose issimple, direct, uncomplicated and honest. ACITN is a remarkable page turner and a compelling read. Critics have compared it to the works of Anne Tyler and Harper Lee. I have a feeling its true value as a serious work of fiction will be properly recognised in years to come.	2001-04-29
US	52572105	R3ONCHN3U2CEOP	014013168X	918150347	The Buddha of Suburbia	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Anomie in 70s England	It's hard not to like &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, Hanif Kureishi's Whitbread Prize winning novel. It's funny, touching and honest. At one level, it can be read as a commentary on the social and cultural upheavals of 70s England that reduced a whole nation to a state of anomie. Nobody escaped or was spared the effects of the malaise. It wasn't just the young pushing the boundaries of acceptable social norms and behaviour by dressing outrageously and spitting in the face of adults. Confusion reigned with the parents generation too, as they sought new meaning in their lives by experimenting with mysticism and eastern religion, the influences of a growing immigrant culture. Within the Indian and mixed race community, the adjustment process was further complicated by cultural incompatibilities that brought tragedy to some and a new dawn to others. Interestingly, the novel doesn't make dramatic capital of Karim's sexual ambiguity. It's merely observed, a metaphor for the sign of the times. His father, the novel's &quot;buddha&quot;, thinks he has finally discovered his true self when he leaves his wife for Eva, but has he really ? He's still as useless and helpless unaided as when he first arrived as an immigrant in England. Eva, the relentless upgrader, is presumably English but she manifests energy levels associated with the tireless immigrant Indians. Confusing, eh ? Then there's Anwar who schemes and engages in emotional blackmail only to find himself frustrated and in a hopeless cul de sac when he lands a son-in-law from homeland who cannot function out of locale. His long suffering daughter, Jameela, forced into an arranged marriage, is both subservient and defiant (like Mahatma Ghandi) and becomes a towering figure of heroism. I found her offer of the olive branch to the baffoonish Changez  the single most touching moment in the novel. You also know her mother (the Princess) has emerged triumphant when she quietly holds her own running the store while her husband wastes away. Kureishi's characterisation is razor sharp throughout. You may dislike his characters, like the horribly selfish Eleanor, who plunges the depths of social depravity to rid herself of any association with her own despised privileged background, but they're real and believable human beings. Then, there's Pyke, the theatre director, whose debauched lifestyle merely proves that you can't change the man underneath just by spouting new slogans. &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; is one incredibly enjoyable read. Kureishi manages to be funny, sharp and poignant, all at the same time and that's no mean feat.  This novel comes highly recommended.	2001-04-20
US	52572105	R2LFP92QBZ1BO4	0140119906	702863006	Love in the Time of Cholera (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Love's redeeming properties : a classic tale	Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez's &quot;Love In The Time Of Cholera&quot; is an impassioned tale of an unrequited love that survived five decades of personal and social change to reap the rewards of patience when the object of this love is set free finally by a death that is at once comic and tragic.  It has the majestic sweep of a grand love story that defies obstacles of social class and opportunity to triumph in the twilight years of its protagonists. More than that, this beautifully lyrical novel examines the nature of love, its transformative and redeeming properties but also its cruelly blinding effect on other human emotions. Florentino's love for Fermina is obsessive in much the way her sudden rejection is impulsive and incomprehensible. Fermina's marriage to the socially eminent Dr Urbino may have been based on different considerations but is the end result not also love, a oneness and unity of being fostered by conflict, domination and acquiescence. Hard to say.  Florentino's singlemindedness in his pursuit of Fermina may invoke admiration for its constancy but is it also not at the same time a deception, a falsehood in the light of his many one-off sexual encounters and his failure to recognise true love until he has conquered.  GGM's grandiosely lyrical prose is filled with colours, smells, fauna, flora, spectacular buildings, open marketplaces, etc, all of which conspire to shroud love and passion from the taint of cholera and disease. The novel also examines the workings of social class, racial prejudice, pride and deceipt to stirring effect. &quot;Love In The Time Of Cholera&quot; reads like a classic. Its slightly erractic sense of chronology is a little unsettling but the redeeming quality of love it so exquisitely evokes simply melts your heart. Think of Fermina's recurring tears when she reminisces on the murder of an old couple who had been lovers for over 40 years, or of Florentino's final capitulation and recognition of his feelings (is that also love ?) for somebody other than Fermina.  That love springs eternal on release from love's bondage is a double irony that resonates throughout this great novel. A &quot;must&quot; for serious readers. Not to be missed.	2001-04-02

She had one mortal life to live and became Martin in that time. In short, Mary was a transexual, a boy trapped in a girl's body, who suffered great torment as a daughter to the brutish farmer, Sonny and his hapless spaced-out wife, Estelle who spends her life shuttling between the funny farm and home. Mary's struggle to come to terms with herself would have been intolerable in provincial Suffolk if not for the support of grandad Cord, schoolmistress Ms McRae and batmaker Edward Harker, all shining examples of humanity in a community constricted by a numbing lack of imagination.  There's the goodhearted but dim witted and conventional minded Irene and the ever pragmatic Grace who hasn't the imagination to understand why her son, Walter needs to seek salvation in faraway Nashville as a country &amp; western singer. Just as Mary finds her own support group, Walter relies on his uncle, Peter to inspire him. Even Timmy, Mary's brother, finally escapes to find fulfillment in a vocation that would  break his father's heart. &quot;Sacred Country&quot; is a novel about the isolation and loneliness of non-conformists. The ghost-like figure of Livia (Estelle's mother, Cord's wife) symbolises the spirit of adventure and heroism. She hovers silently above the community like a big bird urging everyone to their own destinies. Mary took nearly three decades (from the day King George died in 1952) to become Martin. In that time, the world has changed, but have we ? &quot;Sacred Country&quot; is behind it all an ode to human courage. Tremain is a tremendous writer. She has written a novel that will endure. Highly recommended.	2001-03-25
US	52572105	R33DBGM93UZECS	0385497520	507343445	The Child in Time	Books	5	25	27	N	N	An outstanding study of interiors - one of McEwan's best	Ian McEwan never disappoints. I've read &quot;Enduring Love&quot; and &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; and they're both excellent.  In his 1987 Whitbread Prize winning novel &quot;The Child In Time&quot;,  McEwan tunnels deep into the subconscious to deliver an outstanding study of interiors that positively glows and radiates with poignance and compassion.  There is the inevitable social commentary on power, hypocrisy and corruption but none of the anger and vitriolic you might expect. Using the subject of a child gone missing in a supermarket as its starting point, the novel snakes its way around with dramatic twists and turns nobody could have anticipated - a typically McEwan trait - that continually shatters the reader's evolving preconception of what the novel is all about.  One moment you're astral travelling with Stephen as he struggles manfully with his private grief while sitting absentmindedly in parliamentary subcommittee meetings on children's education, the next you're in a nasty car accident and a stroll down memory lane that proves to be pivotal in drawing all the loose ends together.  The confession Stephen's mother makes to him will strike you like a lightning rod.  It comes full circle, suggesting the power of the subconscious in shaping the reality we perceive as fixed or unchanging when it hangs on a thread.  McEwan's command of his craft is none more evident than in suddenly letting Stephen's almost indifferent friendship with Charles take centrestage in the last third of the novel, with devastating effect but for a purpose, not as a gimmick but because it's highly explanatory.  Though McEwan suppresses his natural taste for the macabre in TCIT, there's still a liberal dose of the uncanny left in these pages to savour and enthrall us and give the novel the distinctive McEwan touch.  This time though, he has in store for us an ending that's beautifully rounded, emotionally congruent, and morally uplifting.  What more can a reader ask for ? TCIT is a wonderful novel, richly deserving of the critical accolades heaped on it.  Go get a copy and read it. You won't be disappointed.IT is a wonderful novel, richly deserving of the critical accolades heaped on it.  Go get a copy and read it. You won't be disappointed.	2001-03-16

Its subject is indeed unpleasant - quite revolting actually - but Crace's deeply lyrical and technicoloured prose is so incredibly sparkling and affecting you quickly cotton onto the fact that it isn't just the dead he's writing about. The putrifying rot from the decaying corpses of the murdered old couple among the sand dunes is a deadringer of a metaphor for the estrangement between Celice/Joseph and their daughter Syl, as much as the proverbial worm infecting their own conjugal relationship. To underscore the irony of their fate, Crace deftly ties in Celice's feelings of guilt and Joseph's indifference to a tragic event that marked the beginning and end of their lives together on Baritone Bay. Is it also not entirely fitting that as scientists, they should be surprised by the hand of a murderous thief out there in the dunes than by the predictable hand of nature ? In asking whether it is better to age, wither and decay or be cut off in full bloom, Crace juxtaposes the cruelty of the elements with that of man. Think of Syl. Her callousness may be unnerving and symtomatic of the times, yet paves the way for restoring life to its normal cycle. &quot;Being Dead&quot; makes a fabulous read. It is original, intriguing and intelligent, and has all the ingredients of a great novel. It made the shortlist of several book awards but didn't win any of them. A pity and an injustice, which the reader would do well to correct by going out and buying a copy. You won't regret it !	2001-03-05

It's after all over 450 pages long and boasts a cast of characters that spans several generations and makes Tolstoy's &quot;War and Peace&quot; seem like a cosy family drama. It's hard work initially figuring out who's who and this is complicated by Boyle making us jump backwards and forwards alternating between the 17th and 20th Century, but once you get into a groove, it's no sweat. &quot;World's End&quot; is a multigenerational family saga with all the pyrotechnics you'd expect but Boyle expertly skirts and avoids melodrama. The themes of real estate, power, race, class and betrayal are worked to their fullest and the effect is nothing short of stunning. All quite old fashionedly powerful stuff except for Boyle's quirky sense of humour (eg, Walter van Brunt's accidents) that nudges the novel somewhere left field. Boyle's own empathy for the hippy movement of the 1960s also lends an authencity to the &quot;present day&quot; developments. The novel is really about Walter's search for his mysteriously missing black sheep of a father, Truman - an enigma till the end -  and as he drives himself and others crazy discovering his past and how the histories of three feuding clans are inextricably bound by blood, hatred and deceit, he comes face to face with the shocking truth that in three hundred years, nothing changes and humanity is powerless against the forces that threaten to engulf them. Boyle is a great storyteller. His prose is exotic, colourful, always compelling and a joy to read. Reading &quot;World's End&quot; takes commitment and dedication but the reward makes it all worthwhile. This is one novel nobody who loves serious literature should miss. Highly recommended.	2001-02-17

It's exciting, exhilirating, yet incredibly intelligent and enduring. The novel begins on a deceptively quiet note as art historian Martin Clay retreats to the English countryside with his wife and baby daughter to finish his project on the study of nominalism. But fate quickly intervenes and we find ourselves plunging headlong with him into a journey of discovery of his own corrupt soul as he schemes to covet a painting he suspects to be the missing piece in a series of six by the great Flemish painter Peter Bruegel. The owners he attempts to wrest the prized treasure from are no angels, as we soon discover. The immorality of their mutual intent cancel each other out - they are a rotten bunch - so we find ourselves (shamefully) rooting for Martin as he rollercoasters his way through seemingly countless new obstacles that keep popping up from all sides to derail him. Fueled by a relentless nervous energy and the rush of adrenalin pumping through our veins, we ride with him as he negotiates each twist and turn to yield surprising results. The whole scheme is a farce. Martin knows it. So do we, but Frayn's genius lies in turning the farcical nature of the exploit to reveal a humour and a realism that is at once touching and ironic. Every impulsive tick or nuance experienced by Martin registers with us. Instantly. It's as if Martin is rendered skinless. Transparent. Significantly, Frayn's foray into 16th century Dutch art history isn't the pointless or impenetrable diversion some readers have made it out to be. I was intimidated at first but needlessly. It was friendly, absorbing and relevant. Frayn's prose is always sharp, witty, intelligent and accessible. &quot;Headlong&quot; should, in my opinion, have won the 1999 Booker Prize. Not that J.M. Coetzee's &quot;Disgrace&quot; wasn't a deserving winner. It's just that &quot;Headlong&quot; has that extra spark that should have tilted the balance. One of the best novels I have read in a long time. Don't miss it !	2001-01-25

It's such a pleasure reading this finely written yet understated gem of novel I didn't want it to end. It's hard to describe the type of novel TH is because it's got all the elements of mystery, intrigue, personal tragedy, loss and betrayal that provide the natural ingredients for a great novel but it is only in Trapido's expert hands that all these elements come together to produce a finely judged and balanced whole. The novel is personal, warm and engaging. Her characters - without exception, down to the minor ones - are brilliantly defined and come to life. They leap out at you from the pages like real human beings because they're neither good nor bad, just people with all their frailties. Recounted in flashback and by rotation through the eyes of Ellen, Jonathan and Stella, Trapido weaves together personal contemplation, plot development and social commentary into a complex mosaic of splendour and intrigue. Lydia, a ghost-like figure hovering over the proceedings, is the catalyst for the novel's dramatic development. She is also the glue that binds  the loose pieces together. Trapido's genius is to engineer a denouement that is emotionally congruent, satisfying and uplifting. Amidst the avalanche of new titles being published each week, it is easy to miss this wonderfully little gem of a novel. It would have escaped my attention had it not won the Whitbread Prize award. Please don't miss it. &quot;The Travelling Hornplayer&quot; deserves to be read by all who love good literature.	2001-01-19

Certainly, they share a wicked sense of humour and black comedy, and an interest in writing novels about consumerism and twentieth century industrial values, but the similarity ends there. Whereas the novels of Amis and Barnes always have something interesting to say, and they say it with great aplomp and style, Will Self comes across merely self-indulgent and pretentious in &quot;My Idea Of Fun&quot;. The story of the Fat Controller's svengali like control (no pun intended) and vise like grip over the life of the hapless Ian  Wharton, could be read on different levels. It's as much a fantasy as a satire. Trouble is, Self is so busy trying to write a clever, clever book, using words so esoteric nobody other than novelists could ever know, the result is a highly confused and unsatisfactory novel. The Fat Controller is a thinly disguised &quot;Devil&quot; persona. His multiple identities as Samuel Northcliff and Mr Broadhurst certainly collude to give the impression. Parts of the novel remind me of &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot;, only that Ian is constantly trying to dodge, not make a pact with him. The novel is spookiest when the Fat Controller is not around. Like a ghost lurking in the shadows, you sense his looming presence. The horrific murders he commits are treated in such an offhanded manner they only compound the shock. &quot;My Idea Of Fun&quot; is excellent in parts but the good feeling is never sustained. The chapter entitled &quot;The Land of Children's Jokes&quot; is frankly bizarre and ridiculous. Self's writing tends also to be overwrought, pretentious and unpleasant. I am aware of his reputation as a controversial writer. You either love or loathe him. &quot;My Idea of Fun&quot; didn't help me become a fan. Newcomers are well advised to start elsewhere.	2001-01-13

Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; has been honoured by book critics as the &quot;Booker of Bookers&quot; and no wonder ! It's one of the most original, brilliant and stunning novels I have read in years. How apt too that Rushdie's technique or genre of writing should be described as &quot;magical realism&quot;, for MC dresses the telling of post-war Indian history with so much fun, humour and imagination from references drawn from such a deep ancient well, your senses reel from the rush and cultural overload. Granted, Rushdie's method with language doesn't make for easy or casual reading. Words meticulously chosen, assembled and invested with meaning tumble helter skelter onto the pages in dazzling and colourful rapid fire prose - &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style - you really need to concentrate to understand and savour its riches. Its huge cast of characters evoke the sense of a grand pantheon of gods overlooking the lives of its divided people. Not surprisingly, these same gods (or God) - depending on whether you're Hindu or Muslim - connive to coincide births, deaths and marriages and the mercurial fate of these &quot;midnight's children&quot; who come from disparate social and religious backgrounds with the making of history. The use of the &quot;switched-at-birth good Saleem/bad Shiva&quot; as a central motif in the novel is also a masterful stroke conveying both irony and plurality that characterises India. &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; is one of those important novels that just has to be read by everyone who loves serious fiction. I'd be willing to bet that it'll get on the reading list of every literature student, if it hasn't already done so. A rare and genuine masterpiece. Make time to read it.

On the surface, &quot;The Catastrophist&quot; appears to be treading well worn grounds occupied by illustrious writers like V S Naipaul and Chinua Achebe, but this Whitbread Prize shortlisted novel is no second rate hack job. Its premise may seem all too familiar - a white journalist exorcising her colonialist guilt on foreign soil - but what differentiates this wonderfully compelling novel from others I've read is the fresh perspective it lends to the subject. For once, it's the man (James) who suffers...and for the love of a woman (Ines), who has more serious matters on her mind than thoughts of domestic bliss and love. The male/female role reversal is strangely effective and though it took some getting used to initially, there was nothing that seemed false or didn't ring true. Told exclusively from James' perspective, you ride on his emotional waves and judge his relationship with the other characters accordingly. I found myself disliking Ines for her selfishness, then admiring her courage and vascillating in my opinion of her. The flashback to James' childhood in Ireland is also deeply poignant and explanatory. Ronan Bennett's writing is truly awesome, beautifully judged and always compelling. &quot;The Catastrophist&quot; is both a thriller and a love story. Read either way, it's a towering achievement and an unconditional success. The struggle and emotional tug-of-war between James and Ines parallel that between the freedom fighters and the Belgian colonialists in Congo. A great read and highly recommended.	2000-12-23

Sure, they're at least chronologically arranged to reflect Rose's personal development from a child growing up on the poor side of town to an adult pursuing a career in acting, and it's only this progressive timeline that gives these short stories a momentum they fundamentally lack. Munro seems to suggest that Rose never quite got over being poor and an unattractive child/teenager, hence her serial like entanglement with men whose natures are totally incompatible with hers. The quality of the chapters/short stories also vary quite a bit. Some like &quot;Royal Beatings&quot;, &quot;Half A Grapefruit&quot;, &quot;The Beggar Maid&quot;, and &quot;Mischief&quot; are quite fun and even compelling. Others like &quot;White Swan&quot; and the last three stories are plain boring, which I could have done without. Contary to the blurb, the stories aren't really about Flo and Rose. Sure, Flo's parenting method influenced Rose's development as an individual but it is Rose who takes centrestage. The worst part is feeling that Rose may not be a heroine worth spilling so many words on. I'm not sure if I'll read another one of Munro's after this. Perhaps I picked one that didn't suit me. Depends.	2000-12-19

Despite already knowing how the plot would unfold, I found Patricia Highsmith's &quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; a gripping and exciting read. Mingella stuck faithfully to Highsmith's storyline, departing only in his explicit outing of Tom Ripley by inventing a third murder absent from the novel. So barely concealed is Tom's interest in Dicky and distaste for Marge that it seems the most natural thing for Mingella to do....to complete the persona of Tom Ripley by painting in his sexuality, an aspect which the author had (deliberately ?) left us with a question mark. Whilst the novel is highly entertaining, there are gaps in the plot development which strain credibility. The reaction of Dicky's father to Tom's letter concerning Dickie's so-called will is plain absurd. We know Tom is a sociopath but what's unsatisfying is that by the end of the novel, we still don't feel as if we've nailed his psyche down to anything intuitively convincing. Still, the book is a worthy read and recommended.	2000-12-16
US	52572105	R167MEODS0Y4W0	1582340269	927504401	The Ventriloquist's Tale	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Clash of culture and opposites......magically told	Pauline Melville has written a novel that ranks among the best to be published in the past few years. The subject is a familiar one : the clash of cultural opposites, the subtle tyranny of colonialism in liberal disguise, and the havoc they wreak on lives caught in-between, stranded in no man's land. But its treatment is both unique and magical. Melville is a brilliant writer. Her descriptive prose is so imaginative and incredibly sparkling the reader is quickly swept into an almost make-believe world of savannahs and wild rivers, where mysticism takes over from rationalism and dates and time of day are irrelevant. Scientific explanation has no place in a world filled with dramatic stories of how the moon and the stars and the galaxies that line the sky originate from the uncannily human-like action of fowl from the land and fish from the sea. In this mystical unspoiled world, you are encouraged to feel that even brother and sister incest isn't quite the unnatural and sordid business we are brought up to believe it is. The story of three generations of the McKinnon's living in South American Guyuana with its family secret is unveiled across two timelines, the present and the past. The dual storyline structure, each with its own love interest, resembles that of &quot;Heat and Dust&quot;. The modern day love affair between the third generation half-breed Chofy McKinnon and visiting Czech scholar Rosa Mendelson is fraught with painful irony. Melville seems to be juxtaposing and questioning the &quot;naturalness&quot; of this cross cultural relationship against the incestous affair of the past and coming up with an answer that is apparant only from the way she ends the story. For those familiar with the works of Evelyn Waugh (especially &quot;A Handful Of Dust&quot;), there's also an eery reference to the obsessive reading of Dickens by the visiting Waugh to a native that positively shimmers. A lovely touch. Like &quot;Wide Sagarso Sea&quot; to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. &quot;The Ventriloquist's Tale&quot; is a masterful piece of fictional writing that just has to be read. Go get it !	2000-11-11

It isn't hard to imagine the storm of controversy it created by its flagrant use of overtly sexual and lewd language. Its undeniable shock value notwithstanding, the novel is still regarded today as a classic for its blistering account of life on the other side of the tracks. The novel is full of unsavoury characters consisting of brutes, louts, pimps and whores. They inhabit a world where the sun never shines. They are all doomed. Georgette, the transvetite, Tralala, the town whore and most fascinatingly Harry, the union leader with a terrible secret even he doesn't know and pays for it when he does. Told through a series of loosely connected vignettes, Hubert Selby Junior's pitiless account of these wretched lives is so brutally honest it hurts to read. His prose is unconventional, utilising a combination of vernacular and &quot;speak write&quot; that has the dizzy immediacy of a screenplay. He switches between the first and third person with hardly the skip of a beat. As a novel, it's a mesmerising and compelling read. I couldn't put it down. Its cinematic possibilities have also been exploited and mined to the fullest some years back in a film version that is remarkably faithful to and captures brilliantly the essence of Selby's novel. The film has deservedly become a cult classic. I am only amazed the director didn't take advantage of the cinematic potential of Selby's last chapter, in which he indulges his voyeuristic licence to its fullest. Robert Altman would have had his camera  cutting across the skyline and zooming in turns on the developing chaos within each household in the Brooklyn neighbourhood. &quot;Last Exit To Brooklyn&quot; may still be an uncomfortable read for some today. It's strong stuff, but those with the stomach for it will find it a wonderful read. A true modern classic.	2000-10-31

However, the brooding sense of foreboding that just builds and builds doesn't quite lead anywhere. In the absence of any discernable climax to the plot, the reader experiences none of the cathartic release he expects from the denouement in a novel of this genre. The subject is clearly Stella, the psychiatrist's (Max's) wife. The other characters are just wallpaper and background noise. Whether intended or not, the author has left me with the impression that her fatal obsession with Edgar, the hospital's murderously dangerous patient, has in fact nothing to do with Edgar. Edgar is simply the catalyst for the release of Stella's pent up frustration and hatred for her dead emotional life with Max. It could well have been anyone else. The disappointment is that Edgar started off as a fascinating Hannibal Lector type character until McGrath lost interest in him midway and decided to write him out of the plot. Well, almost. You keep waiting and waiting for his return but he doesn't quite show up. The use of Peter as first person narrator is, on the other hand, an eerily effective technical devise. You keep guessing at his possible entanglement in the whole sordid business and this works wonders in keeping up the suspense. Whatever the novel's shortcomings, McGrath makes up for the small disappointment of its underwhelming ending with his spellbinding way with words. He is such an accomplished writer I would gladly read anything by him anyday. His prose is smoooth as silk and always magnificently crafted. Not quite the stunner I expected but still, a worthy and enjoyable read.	2000-10-20

Crackling with a wicked humour that's uniquely his own, Fischer paints a none-too- pretty picture of life in 50s Hungary by following the antics and exploits of two national basketball players (Pataki and Gyuri) as they traipse around the country playing matches against amateur basketball teams to qualify for privileges and a better life. Through their eyes, we observe a Hungary struggling to come to terms with their new masters who fought on their side in WW2 against the Germans, the widespread petty corruption permeating their society, and the sordid lives of the helpless masses. Despite the seriousness of the novel's theme, Fischer maintains a delightfully light and humourous touch throughout, making its message all the more effective. The silliness of the pranks of our two basketball players only heightens our sense of the pitiful state of their existence. It's as if they need this conscious distraction to remind themselves they're alive (ie, it's the only way they know how to survive and keep their sanity). The novel's ending is heartrending as our two protagonists each find their own way forward. This is one of the best books of its kind I've read. It's funny and serious at the same time and Tibor Fischer is a terrific writer. I highly recommend it.	2000-10-19

Not that it hasn't its moments, only that they occur too rarely and mostly at the beginning and end of the novel, framing what must seem an overly long and terribly slow moving middle section. This is all the more disappointing given that Kate's adventures in the Australian outbacks form the emotional core of the novel. Her escape from her natural family and her dreadful husband and in-laws following the tragic death of her children is to redeem as well as to expunge herself of all the loathsome and corrupt elements of her life with her philandering businessman husband. It is only her Uncle Frank, a fallen priest and the novel's most colourful character, who forever lives in her heart. Quite apart from the immense difficulty I had with Keneally's awkward prose, I couldn't quite nail down the story's setting long after the plot unfolded. Each time I imagined Kate in Victorian garb (ie, hooped skirts) would I be reminded that she attended Kiss concerts. Strangely, the mental picture I conjured of the storyline kept shifting between period and contemporary. Could this be just me ? Perhaps but even so, the author must take some responsibility for this curious lack of contextual definition. There is an interesting story (and a movie even) in there somewhere, but Keneally has buried it so hopelessly in layers of inaccessible prose it's hard for the reader to work up any enthusiasm for the book. No, I shan't be tackling &quot;The Schindler's List&quot; in the near future if &quot;Woman of the Inner Sea&quot; is typical of Keneally's work.	2000-09-20
US	52572105	R26SY5IRH2XVL7	0786706880	533662959	Letters to Alice on First Reading Jane Austen (Weldon, Fay)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A &quot;must read&quot; for sceptics of the value of literature	There's a national debate going on in my country concerning the value and  relevance of literature in modern society. Students are liberally  encouraged by their schools to drop literature from their curriculum in  favour of more examination friendly subjects to increase their chances of  achieving the maximum aggregate score for their &quot;O&quot; and  &quot;A&quot; levels. So, it is not without some irony that I should be  reading Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice On First Reading Jane  Austen&quot; as my introduction to this author's works. Well, I was  completely blown away by its first chapter/letter entitled &quot;The City  of Invention&quot; which alone is worth the price of the book and....says  it all. The imagery she uses in distinguishing the different genres in  writing as well as the intrinsic or superficial merits of each form of  writing is absolutely breathtaking. In it, she hints at why Shakespeare in  the &quot;city of invention&quot; is that castle that marks the skyline and  a compulsory stop for every tour group making the rounds of the  &quot;city&quot;. Weldon is eloquent, witty and wickedly funny with her  pen. While she never quite hits the high of that first chapter again, she  offers some rare and valuable insight into why Austen is read even today.  Great literature has the power when read (whether quietly or aloud) to  touch the masses by revealing the universality of some home truths or  values they espouse. Although Austen fans will be delighted to see their  favourite characters come to live in Weldon's world, you don't have to like  Jane Austen to enjoy this book. To fellow Singaporeans sceptical about the  value of literature in schools, my advice is &quot;read this and you will  see how absurd the question really is&quot;. No matter if you disagree  after reading the book, b'cos you would have had a jolly good time. Great  stuff. Truly.	2000-09-10
US	52572105	R1MSP69Y9LUGUS	0375705503	776660814	England, England	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Serious, yet witty and humourous - a great read	Julian Barnes didn't impress me much with his first book, &quot;Metroland&quot;, so it was with some scepticism and doubt that I  started on his 1998 Booker Prize nominated &quot;England, England&quot;.  The prognosis was good after reading the first short section entitled  &quot;England&quot; and any reservations I had quickly lifted. Though this  promising introduction proved relevant, it didn't quite point to the  direction the novel was headed for. What ensues is an engaging mix of some  pretty serious ideas, brilliantly executed. Barnes' craft, his razor sharp  wit and sense of humour reminds me very much of Martin Amis, another  luminous contemporary novelist with an uncompromising yet dazzling style.  Here, in &quot;England, England&quot;, Barnes uses satire to present,  analyse and explore the modern day obsession with &quot;replicas&quot;, the  advantages of which over their sources have been touted without any genuine  understanding of its implications. Sure, &quot;originals&quot; are a true  slice of life and therefore, messy, smelly and unpredictable. Replicas, on  the other hand, are neat, run like clockwork, and given to stage management  for optimum commercial effect. But they're sterile and false and the  antithesis of life itself. Notice how the actors in the Isle of Wight  (England, England) grow unruly, break down, or start to invent human forms  of activity after the loss of contact with the real world. Ironically,  Martha, the damaged heroine, learns a few hard lessons from her real life  interaction with the likes of Paul and Sir Jack. Barnes punctuates his tale  with hilarious surprises along the way. These little flourishes only serves  to whet your appetite. But he delivers each time and...how ! The last  instalment is an absolute coup de grace, an elaborate painting (almost) of  the future of old England. The effect is both poignant and ambivalent and  to be relished by the reader. &quot;England, England&quot; is serious  fiction of the first order. It is thematically rich, full of humour and  wit, and a joy to read. I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2000-09-01

Using beautifully lyrical prose, she insinuates and entices, then  reels and draws you in. Ilona's sense of foreboding when she meets the  hosts of the dinner party she attends with Claud foreshadows not so much  her breakup with Martin but more significantly her discontinued  relationship with her older semi-retarded brother Albert whom she had  deliberately left behind. The feelings of guilt, pain and loss that these  later chapters evoke are so real and true they moved me to tears.  Berriault's genius lies in the economy, intimacy and emotional accuracy of  her writing. I think Ilona realised at the end that the world isn't made of  two kinds of people, those &quot;blessed&quot; and those not. Ilona's  distress from Martin's departure is mirrored in Albert's hopeless pining  for his sister to make contact and this is what gives the novel a balance  and roundness that makes &quot;The Lights Of Earth&quot; such an excellent  novel. I don't know if this is the place to discover Berriault. I do know  however that I enjoyed it immensely and if the proof of the pudding isn't  in the eating, where then lies it ?	2000-08-13

The proliferation of American slang and jargon  made the book a difficult read for me. There are nevertheless tracts in  there which I truly enjoyed - like the disastrous incident with the young  middle class couple who wanted to experiment to experience the real thing -  very much a sign of the times which evoked in me an indescribable sense of  horror. That the novel is populated exclusively by unsavoury characters is  not unexpected or a put off. After all, we're dealing with the underground  world of drug traffickers in a hell that has followed us back to America  from Vietnam, where you learn who you really are. As I was reading the  book, I was thinking to myself, &quot;what a great movie this would  make&quot; not realising that it was made into a movie in the late 70s  under the title of &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; with Nick Nolte,  Tuesday Weld and Michael Moriaty. While I found much of the book tough  going and confusing - especially the part with Ray Hicks hallucinating -  perhaps seeing the movie will help make the meaning clearer. My feelings  towards the book are decidedly mixed. It's an important book. I only wish  it were a little more accessible to non-Americans like me.	2000-08-08

The humble servant boy, Triton, is steeped in  old world values but hero worships the intellect of his marine geologist  employer, Mr Salgado. Both fail to come to terms with the political issues  of the day. Triton is too busy keeping house and entertaining Mr Salgado's  friends to care. His employer spends his time astral travelling and nursing  his many esoteric concerns while impressing his girlfriend, Nili, with his  hospitality. Ironically, it is the humble Triton who shows more strength of  character and resourcefulness than any of the educated lot. The outcome of  Mr Salgado's affair with Nili is reflective of the tension generated by an  evolving value system. &quot;Reef&quot; is both subtle and lyrical in its  appeal and Gunesekera rewards us with an ending that is both heartwarming  and uplifting. It is an impressive debut by Gunesekera and not surprisingly  shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Highly recommended.	2000-07-29

A fairy tale of horror	Hailed as a tour-de-force of creative writing, Patrick Suskin's &quot;Perfume&quot; is a classic fairy tale of horror. Is it any wonder that a human society so filled with putrifying rot, disease and sickening  body odours should produce a specimen of pure evil as Jean-Baptiste  Grenouille ? As I followed the development of Grenouille's personality into  the monster he became, I found my feelings toward him becoming increasingly  ambivalent. Is he the inexplicable human embodiment of evil we are asked to  believe or the refracted image of a distorted humanity that is estranged  from and therefore seeks love ? There are shades of Caliban in the  murderous Grenouille. He is both perpetrator and victim. His panic on  discovery of his lack of body odour is truly pitiful because it becomes the  shameful emblem of his perceived rejection by society. The denial of his  humanity is what drives his self loathing and megalomania which must run  its tragic course. There is enough evidence in Suskind's tale to support  this reading. Just in case I give the impression that &quot;Perfume&quot;  is laden with heavy messages which might detract from your enjoyment of it,  well, it needn't, as Suskind's prose is as fluid, supple and intoxicating  as the scents he writes about. It's a stunning piece of work that will be  enjoyed by all. It doesn't come more highly recommended.	2000-07-23

That's my honest reaction to this quietly restrained tale of remembrance, whose floodgates were opened by the  unexpected death of Judge McKelva and the ensuing funeral gathering of  neighbours, in-laws and family. Welty's heroine, Laurel, through whose eyes  the tale is told, is so unnaturally quiet - she barely speaks or responds  to conversation - she's a Cordelia-like character from &quot;King  Lear&quot;. She must also be the most underwritten protagonist ever in a  novel. The reader has almost to construct her character from the dots left  by the author. Wanda Fay is, on the other hand, a caricature - a southern  bimbo. The story (thankfully short) moves at such a slow pace you have to  pinch yourself to stay awake. The dialogue is awkward and hard to make out.  Maybe that's how southerners speak or sound to foreigners. It's only in the  last chapter that sparks start to fly and Laurel shows she has blood  flowing through her veins. It took a trapped bird in the house to bring  that out. Maybe I didn't get it, but &quot;The Optimist's Daughter&quot;  must be the most disappointing prize winning book I have read in a long  time. Not a priority read. For me anyway.	2000-07-14
US	52572105	R292CBRQRZWZ28	0316780375	480327121	The Weight of Water	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Twin stories in spirit	Anita Shreve's &quot;Weight of Water&quot; is no ordinary murder mystery. At its core is, of course, an old murder mystery just waiting to be dredged up for re-examination based on the diary of its sole witness, but what's  intriguing about it is not its secret which isn't so spectacular - you sort  of guess the truth half way through the novel - but its spiritual and  emotional congruence with the contemporary story which runs alongside it.  As the narrator peels away the layers that conceal the truth in the old  mystery, she discovers chinks in her own marriage which awakens within  herself feelings of sexual jealousy and responses which  surprise even the  narrator herself. Shreve's attempt to harmonise the edgy sense of discord  overshadowing both stories by seamlessly shifting backwards and forwards in  time isn't entirely successful or unique, but it worked for me. The ending  is slightly anti-climactic but this small disappointment is more than made  up by Shreve's writing which is excellent throughout and very effective. I  found &quot;Weight of Water&quot; a compelling and highly enjoyable read.  Definitely worth checking out.	2000-07-11

He spends  half his time working as a lowly receptionist in a clinic and the other  half struggling to stay in one piece, if not boring his friends to death  pontificating about the dismal state of politics prevailing in the modern  state of Israel. He engages his family and friends but is succoured by  them. His relationships with various women including his ex-wife are also  frankly ludicrous. But Efraim's incoherent and wasted life cannot be  interpreted as anything other than Oz's metaphor for the moribund state of  Israel's moral authority after securing its own nationhood. He questions  the hardline Jewish approach to its Arab neighbours today by drawing  parallels with the mentality of the Nazis in the 30s and 40s. The lurking  blood hound in man is humourously but no less chillingly portrayed in the  episode with the cockroach. Dimi's shattering confession to Efraim about  the dog is equally poignant. Oz, though cynical about the lasting effects  of positive action on future generations, ends on a quietly optimistic  note. &quot;Fima&quot; isn't exactly an easy book to digest. The symbolism  is a little heavyhanded in parts, but the undeniable sense of humour in  Oz's writing carries the book. Oz is in fine form for most of the way but  gets distracted and loses focus  towards the last third. Still,  &quot;Fima&quot; makes an intellectually stimulating read and is definitely  worth checking out.	2000-07-08

I picked up a second hand copy expecting little and was absolutely bowled over by it. It  is THAT good ! &quot;Chocolat&quot; is written in a mouthwatering and  delicious prose that leaves you drooling for more. Harris' story  superficially resembles a morality play. The running battle between  newcomer Vianne Rocher to Lansquenet and parish priest Francis Reynaud is  often depicted as a duel between good and evil. Somehow, I don't see it  that way. Vianne, the protagonist, isn't a paragon of virtue. She is far  too complex a character to serve as a symbol. And Francis isn't really evil  either. His half crazed obsession with conformity and determination to  stamp out the unusual is born of a deep self loathing and persecution  complex that deserves only our pity. Vianne is just the catalyst the small  town of Lansquenet needs to release its members from the prison they  inhabit and she does it with chocolate. Josephine, Luc and even Roux  discover themselves from knowing and being influenced by Vianne. Grand dame  Armande's dictum is to live life or be dead. She is a living testimony to  the celebration of life. Harris also contrasts the hypocritical piety of  Christianity with the unadorned goodness of humanity. &quot;Chocolat&quot;  made such an exhilirating read I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  It isn't particularly deep or complex in its themes but is such a hugely  enjoyable novel I would recommend it unreservedly to just about anybody.  Some serious readers have criticised Harris' fairytale like story for its  simplemindedness. Perhaps. But like its subject (chocolate), it may not be  good for you but it sure feels like heaven when you're savouring it !	2000-07-07

Mary Panton, the novella's heroine, is flawed as  a person but redeemed by compassion and principles. The film version takes  a few liberties with the nationality of Rowley (he is English in the book  but American in the movie) and embellishes the plot with twists and turns  but remains faithfull enough to the spirit of the novel. The casting of  Kristin Scott Thomas as Mary and James Fox as Edgar is also spot on. A  quick and enjoyable read. Doesn't matter whether you read the book or watch  the movie first.	2000-07-03

Cleverly structured around  three separate plots and casts of characters, the reader is invited to  wander into the past through a maze of speculative events spanning three  centuries, which all come together neatly in the denouement. The novel  raises several complex issues on art, truth and reality. Is reality fact  for the unimaginative ? Does the poet not through his art create reality  rather than merely describe it ? Does reality exist other than the  representation or depiction of it ? Is imitation hedonistic and therefore  worthless and untrue ? &quot;Chatterton&quot; poses these questions and  more in a &quot;whodunnit&quot; style novel that is both witty and clever  in its execution. Ackroyd's characters twitter rather than speak but not  incongruously considering the context. Some readers might find  &quot;Chatterton&quot; a bit of a curio today. The subject matter isn't  exactly topical but the issues it raises are timeless and fascinating. A  wonderfully entertaining and thought provoking book. Highly recommended.	2000-06-29

The truths it reveals about family ties and the needless pain and suffering they sometimes engender are universal, cutting across all  cultures. The story may be set in Ireland and specifically about the  Morans, but all through the book, I was keenly aware of some home truths  which McGahern deftly delivers and gives the novel its special poignance.  Humanity is presented in all its ordinariness and with stark realism. The  patriach may seem a tyrant in Great Meadows. The state of his family's  emotional wellbeing fluctuates according to his mood swings. His second  wife is a saint. She bears with and makes excuses for him. With mutual  moral support, his daughters help hold the family together. The boys rebel  to different degrees, leading to different outcomes. Is old man Moran to  blame ? Yes and no. There are always reasons for everything. It's the way  life is. McGahern's novel hints at Irish/English hostilities and we  understand that this has played its part in Moran's character development.  There are few dramatic highs and lows. Events march to the normal tempo of  life. McGahern's prose is plain, straightforward and true. As in real life,  the novel is not neatly segmented into chapters. The storytelling is  seamless and timeless. The setting is fairly modern but the attitude  strangely conservative. Maybe that's intentional. Maybe not. &quot;Amongst  Women&quot; isn't going to grab you by the collar but it will grow on you.  It's a Booker Prize nominee and a Irish Literary Award winner. A worthy  read.	2000-06-18

The two stories that run in  parallel to one another (Jakob's and Ben's) are inextricably bound by the  common source they  draw upon. Jakob Beer, poet and translator, is rescued  by Greek geologist, Athos, but cannot escape his memories which haunt him  throughout his life. He is a damaged soul and irredeemably lost to the  past. Alex, his first wife, couldn't save him, so she left him. He finds  redemption in Michaela and is released from the prison of his memory by his  dead sister, Bella, who relaunches him to the land of the living. Ben,  whose parents are survivors of the Holocaust, seeks therapy from the  writings of Jakob, and eventually comes to terms with their own damaged  lives. &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot; is essentially a novel of interiors.  There is a barely recognisable plot and hardly any dialogue. Dazzlingly  colourful images fly across the pages of descriptive prose which  approximate poetry. To savour all of its rich linguistic qualities, readers  are advised to proceed slowly and allow the images to build in your mind.  You will be richly rewarded.	2000-06-07

They can't tell  what's real and what's not anymore. A typical family is made up of a  bizarre mixture of &quot;yours and mine&quot;. Kids are either obsessed  (Heinrich) or paranoid (Denise). Adults are paralysed by an inexplicable  fear of death (Jack and Babette). In short, DeLillo's vision is of a  society disfigured by dysfunctionality. He suggests that the fear of death  experienced by Jack and Babette is in fact symptomatic and a reflection of  the uncertainty over their own state of being. Death helps define life by  giving it boundaries, thereby proving life's existence. Has the media taken  over and become the substitute for real experience ? Are we being  manipulated by packaged news or genuinely reacting to scenes from the  ground ? &quot;Deja vu&quot; which strikes certain members of the Gladney  clan proves the media's power of suggestion. So many richly interconnected  ideas tumble from DeLillo's much celebrated novel that you have to read it  in one sitting to truly &quot;get it&quot;. His writing style is sharp but  sometimes leaves you dizzy and a little disoriented. Maybe that's  intentional given its subject. He leaves his most powerful statement on  religion and belief (the episode with the nuns) to the very last. What  insight ! &quot;White Noise&quot; is such a power packed novel of ideas I  can see it being studied as contemporary literature for years to come. A  great piece of work. Highly recommended reading.	2000-06-01

A young girl living with her two aunts falls in love with an American soldier with  a secret and less than honourable designs. The outcome of this one-sided  love affair (conducted mainly in Rita's head) is a foregone conclusion and  possibly the least important aspect of the novel. Bainbridge's interest  lies in the exploration of small town provincial lives. Aunt Nellie's  obsession with family heirlooms and being the faithful custodian of her  late mother's furniture and other treasures is both touching and sad. Sad,  because these objects have become a substitute for living. Aunt Margo - the  younger widowed aunt - inhabits the novel's moral centre. Taut and  crackling with repressed desire and emotion, she deeply resents the family  pressure that forced her to give up a second chance at conjugal bliss. Her  feelings towards Rita's doomed affair with Ira are certainly ambivalent.  She acts out of genuine concern for Rita but there is a strong element of  sexual envy as well. Bainbridge's writing is confident and authentic.  Clearly, she understands the lives she's writing about. Readers may find  the going slow. For that reason, it will not appeal to all, but for its  genre (reminds me a little of Penelope Fitzgerald's &quot;The  Bookshop&quot;), &quot;The Dressmaker&quot; is a triump and a worthy read.	2000-05-27

If it hasn't already achieved the status of a contemporary classic, Nick Hornby's &quot;High Fidelity&quot; will surely become the literary anthem for past and future generations of lost young men. Men who spend their  lives escaping life and commitment. Rob is a vinyl junkie who owns a second  hand record shop in London, an eternal teen whose emotional state and inner  momentum is powered not by regular &quot;adult&quot; concerns (ie, jobs,  mortgages, etc) but by 60s pop/rock classics. His Top 5 Desert Island Discs   become the soundtrack of his life. Relationships (past and present) begin  inevitably with a perfect compilation tape and end when the chase is won  and reality bites. Growing up on Dusty Springfield's &quot;The Look of  Love&quot; may have changed his life forever. Problem is, life doesn't  quite deliver like Dusty sings it.  Hornby's take on Rob is so spot-on and  offhandedly true it's become a timeless metaphor for Joe of all  generations. This is quite simply the most funny, readable and enjoyable  book I have read all year. It's fast and zany and such rollicking fun you  don't want it to end. Being a huge 60s pop/rock fan myself, I absolutely  thrilled to the musical references which brought back so many wonderful  memories I very nearly forgot. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is quite the most  accessible &quot;must read&quot; novel for everyone. Yes, both guys and  gals. I promise you a great time. Amazing book ! PS : I haven't watched the  movie yet, but I can't imagine it topping the book. I'd also bet that some  of the resonance has been lost from the film's relocation to Chicago.	2000-05-21

It is also deservedly the 1993 Whitbread Prize winner. Atkinson's incisive study of  the practical and emotional lives of four generations of Yorkshire women  and their huge families never hits a false note. Richly detailed and  revealing in its observation of family life, the story of Ruby Lennox and  the women who preceded her is told with such great humour (mostly of the  tongue-in-cheek variety) you yield to its charms instantly and allow  yourself to be drawn into their lives. Yet, for all that, Ruby's portrait  of her family (father, mother and sisters) isn't a pretty one. They're  selfish, insensitive and so preoccupied with their own discontent they seem  to prefer watching their wounds fester than work at preserving the soul of  the family. The story, at the end of it, leaves you with a feeling of  tragedy and sadness. For all that, Atkinson's talent is to make us believe  in and care for this bunch of largely unsympathetic characters. She  succeeds using a smooth and sparkling prose that's sheer delight. A small  criticism - as the linear story gathers pace and unfolds, the flashbacks  (interposed as minor chapters or &quot;footnotes&quot; to the main  chapters) begin to read like distractions designed to test the patience of  readers. It's frankly a narrative technique that doesn't quite work.  Nevertheless, this prize winning first novel of Atkinson's is a major piece  of work that should be read and enjoyed by all who love good literature.  Wonderful book. Highly recommended.	2000-05-17

Consisting of anecdotes  whose central focus rotate among the  four Garcia sisters, their story is told backwards. Unfortunately, the use  of reverse chronology as a narrative technique produces an oddly unsettling  effect, depriving the novel of its natural flow and feel. There are some  truly memorable episodes in there which stick in your mind (eg, the adult  Yolanda's yearning for the taste of the guava fruit on her return to  &quot;the Island&quot;, young Carla's encounter with the sex pervert in the  car, and Papi's narrow escape from his political enemies, etc) but  unexceptional fillers occupy almost as much space. I found the last third  of the novel,  especially the ending, disappointing. Alvarez was working  with excellent material but somehow didn't fully succeed with her  characterisation. I never felt I understood or cared for the characters.   Her shorthanded treatment of the politics of the times in &quot;the  Island&quot; was also an error of judgement. Lacking a  profound undertow,  the story of the Garcia sisters remained....a story. Alaverez's novel would  have been that much stronger had she used a longhanded approach in  explaining the political backdrop against which the family lived their  lives. All in all, an enjoyable read, but not the best among its genre. I  much preferred Christina Garcia's &quot;Dreaming In Cuban&quot;.	2000-05-10

For a good two-thirds  of the novel, Dunmore kept up the suspense with a litter of teases and dark  hints which unfortunately remained unresolved and a mystery even at the  end. You could have forgiven her deliberate sense of obscurity and  vagueness had she gone for a less open ended denouement, but the last third  of the novel was a major let down for me. I felt almost cheated after a  such a promising start. Sure, Dunmore writes exquisitely. Her prose is  smooth and fluent and a joy to read. Pity she let the suspense and momentum  peter out midway. In my humble opinion, not up to the standards I was  expecting from a prize winner. But Dunmore is an excellent writer. Perhaps  the next book I read of hers will be more fulfulling.	2000-05-01

It is written in plain simple language and is so direct and brutal in its honesty you cannot but marvel at the courage and integrity of its author. The &quot;no bull@#$t, warts and all styled&quot; confessions of Annie John is prickly and edgy. You may even feel uncomfortable or negatively towards her. However you look at it, her growing resentment and alienation from her mother cannot be sufficiently explained by the developing sexual tension between the two women. It's inexplicable and that's the point. Kincaid is almost unapologetic about Annie's slyness, deception and faithlessness towards those around her. The emotional turbulence of adolescence, in particular the deep dark secrets of a little black girl growing up in Antigua, isn't an easy subject to tackle but Kincaid is in commanding form throughout and deals with it in a most arresting manner. There's also some great humour in there, like the &quot;breadfruit&quot; episode which makes the smile of Annie's mother resemble that of a crocodile. Sure, some of us may feel ambivalent towards Annie as she sets sail for England, but there's a startling honesty about Kincaid's insights into the heart of a bright young girl desperate to burst out of the confines of her home that is simply undeniable. Therein lies the value of this little book. Definitely worth checking out.	2000-04-30

Christopher Nolan's &quot;Under The Eye Of The Clock&quot; is an autobiographical account of his incredibly awe-inspiring and miraculous life. Born a cripple, he could have been consigned to the rubbish heap but  instead and against all odds became a celebrated writer of this Whitbread  Book winner, &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; as well as an early book of poems.  Without taking anything away from Joseph Meehan (a self portrait of Nolan),  he couldn't have overcome his debilitating handicaps to scale the heights  he did without the steady support and tender loving care of his family. A  father, mother and sister who are such warm and emotionally intelligent  human beings anybody would be blessed and proud to have them as family. The  school principals, teachers and fellow students who accepted him, nurtured  him and gave him the chance to prove himself equal to the best among  physically whole human specimens are themselves shining examples of  humanity who deserve as much recognition in Nolan's lifestory. Although it  has been compared with James Joyce's &quot;Portrait of an Artist as a Young  Man&quot;, it is in reality nothing like it. Whereas Joyce's work is for  the most part depressing and full of pain and harshness, Nolan's story is  so morally uplifting you almost forget its grave subject matter. Nolan's  dazzling and inventive writing style is also unique and something to  relish. He coins and mints new words which have a yet found a conventional  meaning but are so emotionally accurate you know they're right. Read this  if you're feeling down and need something to restore your faith in mankind  !	2000-04-26

I confess to being a novice in American history but when I finished the book, I thought  perhaps I understood for the first time the political landscape that  inspired Arthur Miller's &quot;The Crucible&quot;, which I recall having  studied for my A-levels English literature exams many years ago. It seems  to me that madness lies latent and lurks beneath every human society, even  one that professes to be the universal champion of human rights. In  Doctorow's words, &quot;the Isaacsons were confirmed in guilt because of  who campaigned for their freedom, and their supporters discredited because  they campaigned for the Isaacsons&quot; - a totally circular and  tautologous logic ! Yet, the novel's central concern isn't necessarily  about the tragic path Paul and Rochelle Isaacson took to the electric  chair, but about the permanent and devastating impact the arrest and murder  of the Isaacsons had on the lives of their two small children, Daniel and  Susan. How else can one explain the perfect boy, Daniel's sudden, cruel and  violent turns which visits his own wife and son long after his parents'  tragic death. Or the intelligent Susan's continued breakdown and descent  into madness. Doctorow certainly takes wild liberties with time, jumping  backwards and forwards in his narration. He also mixes first and third  person narrative techniques and uses a blend of historical fact and  commentary to reinforce the power of the tragedy. Reading &quot;The Book of  Daniel&quot; was an eye-opening and harrowing experience for me. It moved  me to tears and even reflecting on it sends chills down my spine. This is  essential reading. Powerful and harrowing - &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot;  is a truly collosal literary achievement. Read it !	2000-04-21

The River Narmada is the perfect metaphor for Mehta's representation of the rich complexities of spiritual and mythical life throughout the ages. The narrator, a retired bureaucrat, begins his journey of discovery into the soul of his country by the holy river where he encounters a myriad of colourful characters and situations altogether unfamiliar to him. By taking refuge up at the rest house, he seeks escape from life but realises finally that he has &quot;chosen the wrong place to flee the world&quot; because &quot;too many lives converge on the banks of the River Narmada&quot;. Fittingly, his awakening takes place by the holy river, which in Mehta's words &quot;is an unbroken record of the human race&quot;. The main message seems to be that conscious escape from life is self defeating. Meaning flows from life, without which all search for spiritual fulfillment is fruitless. Food for thought. Mehta's language is beautifully poetic and lyrical but never obscure. Like many Indian writers, she too dabbles a little in magical realism which only adds colour to the enchanting stories spilling out of the river. A truly delightful novel.  END	2000-04-15

For much of the way, you may find your heart racing and yourself thinking you can't put this down until you reach the  end. But at the heart of this wonderfully entertaining novel is a romance,  a romance so huge and heady it's almost redemptive in its force. The  thriller elements of murder, blackmail and betrayal only create the  opportunities and subtext for the great love affair to play out. Some  readers may find the Salvador/Delphine affair surprising and even  incredible. You wouldn't if you allow yourself the luxury of accepting  Cupid's strange ways. But what's even more intriguing to me is Boyd's  ability to generate a deep sense of sustained ambivalence in the treatment  of his characters and their personal situations throughout the novel.  You're never sure enough about any of them to rule anything out. For  instance, Salvador's Filipino colleague, Pantaleon, shows a surprising side  to him under pressure. Delphine also remains an enigma, right to the very  end. Boyd's reluctance at a clear resolution perhaps hints at how he really  wishes us to regard his novel, not as a &quot;who dunnit&quot; but as a  sojourn with the human heart which needs Love and Romance to nourish and  keep it alive. Kay, Salvador's daughter, isn't a technical devise or a red  herring either. She may be an observer and peripheral to the plot which is  told in flashbacks, but we are told she's one of two reasons why Salvador  has managed to gain strength to survive his personal tragedy. &quot;The  Blue Afternoon&quot; is an engaging and superbly written novel. Highly  recommended reading.	2000-04-15

It is arguably the most outstanding yetaccessible of the five novels that made the shortlist in 1994. Set in the medievial ages, KOA is a brilliant and highly intelligent fable of ideas. Controversial perhaps, but timeless. Even today, we continue to debate the question of whether the concept of God is innate to man or acquired through the intellect and the socialisation process. In the middle ages, certainly during the times of the infamous Spanish Inquisition, it was heretical to espouse the creed of atheism. The crime was punishable by torture and death. The story of Amara (the wolf child), brought up and suckled by wolves before being returned to human society, was to be the great experiment by which learned scholars of the day sought to prove the existence of God. Palinor, the castaway who hails from a world where people live by the principles of humanism, finds his life endangered when his unconventional ideas threaten the orthodoxy of the day. Paton Walsh's novel isn't even specifically about religion or humanism. It is about the need for human society in its search for truth to understand the confining nature of paradigms, to continually challenge conventional wisdoms and reinvent itself, and to practice tolerance if the search for truth is to be served. Astonishing, yet not. &quot;Knowledge of Angels&quot; is a beautifully crafted and highly entertaining novel of ideas that should be read by those who love good literature. I can't recommend it highly enough.  END	2000-04-10

It may not be the most natural place to start, nor is it her most celebrated novel. I guess I was intrigued by its subject and the blurb at the back of the book. I wasn't disappointed. As many online reviewers have pointed out, Morrison  isn't easy to get into. She can be abstract, even a little obscure in her  prose, so you have to concentrate to grasp her message. But I was richly  rewarded for my efforts. &quot;Tar Baby&quot;'s multifaceted treatment of  gender and racial politics is simply outstanding. She deals with  male/female, black/white, parent/child, rural/urban issues, using a plot  and a fascinating cast of characters for every last bit of irony inherent  in the material. It would make a great movie. Valerian Street escapes to  the Caribbean but locks himself in a greenhouse fitted to recreate the  familiar environment he seeks to escape from. He is patron to Jadine,  material girl and educated niece of his black servants, Sydney and Ondine,  yet condescending in his relationship with blacks. He is smug and openly  contemptuous of his wife Margaret's bimbo background but isn't remotely  prepared for the shock that awaits him when the past is revealed. The big  showdown scene between the Streets and their servants in the middle marks  an the early climax from which nobody - including the plot - quite  recovers. Intentionally or not, it upstages the tumultouse love affair  between Jadine and black intruder, Son. Both are black, but that's about as  much they have in common with one another. Will they succeed in overcoming  the deep cultural divide that separates them ? I won't spoil it for fellow  readers. Read the ending and figure it out for yourselves. &quot;Tar  Baby&quot; was a fantastic reading experience for me. I loved the book so  much I didn't want it to end. Truly.	2000-04-02

It opens with a highly intriguing first  paragraph which sadly only partially delivers what it promises to do. The  display of Norman's naturalist tendencies and fascination with birds is  subtle and well judged in as far as they helped define the character of  Fabian Vas. Having said that, I feel he got a little carried away with  scene setting which caused the story to drag on a bit in the first half.  The novel only started to take off with the murder, but from there, the  writing is so uniformly excellent you readily overlook the deficiencies  that went before. Norman writes with a restraint and economy that is  unusual in thrillers. The dialogue of his characters is similarly spare and  understated but with a bitterness and unpleasantness which underlie their  true feelings. I found this to be especially true of Margaret and Alaric.  By the end of the novel, you wonder whether Fabian's weakness is any less  forgiveable than the whiskey swigging Margaret's upfront ruthlessness.  Probably not. The novel has all the human interest elements to make a great  story and it succeeds for much of the time. The highlight for me was  Fabian's redemption via the painting of the church mural depicting coastal  life and the dramatic events which altered the course of their lives.  &quot;The Bird Artist&quot; is a very accomplished piece of work. It is  deserving of its National Book Award prize nomination and a highly  recommended read.	2000-03-26

The stories recall nightmares you wouldn't wish on your enemies. Allison writes with  such bitterness, anger and ferocity it's frightening. I found it a tough  read and had to tackle it a bit at a time. The essays/stories are not all  compelling. Some I found esoteric and skipped. The earlier ones like  &quot;River of Names&quot; were mostly excellent. The later ones which tell  of Allison's voyage of sexual self discovery were harder to get through.  It's not the graphic sex that's hard to handle but the emotional landscape  that's alien to those outside the community she writes of.  Personally, I  found &quot;Trash&quot; an unpleasant read and while I respect Allsion's  integrity, she's obviously not going to be everybody's cup of tea.	2000-03-24

It is a brilliantly crafted and expertly executed literary achievement by one of Australia's most promising modern young writers.  Preparing to start a new life with his  wife Jennifer and young daughter Billie in Ireland,  Scully's life is blown  apart when he goes to the airport to meet his family but finds only Billie  and no message from his missing wife. With Billie in tow, he travels to  Greece, France and the Netherlands in search of Jennifer but unbeknown to  himself begins a journey of self discovery that will alter the course of  his life in ways he never envisaged. The Scully you meet in the first few  chapters, giddy with happiness and anticipation as he toils to make  habitable a ramshackle old place he has bought to begin a new life with his  family, is so &quot;up&quot; and vibrant a life force, you feel a palpable  sense of hurt watching his slide downhill. But redemption awaits around the  corner. While Jennifer, a shadowy figure, remains an enigma, her  disappearance forces Scully to come to terms with feelings of betrayal and  to recognise that it is perhaps impossible to truly know another human  being. The unknowability of the human heart, arguably the novel's central  theme, is powerfully captured in the recurring image of riders on white  horses, all spendiferously dressed, but still and silent and oblivious to  all as they line up for parade in the night. The gradual role reversal we  witness in the adult-child relationship between Scully and Billie only  deepens the sense of pathos evoked by new circumstances as they unfold.  Billie, quiet and uncommunicative, but who proves ultimately to be the  quicker learner of life's lessons, ends up taking charge. She quite  literally controls the purse strings by the end of the story. Winton's  language is colourful and he uses imagery to dazzling effect. His minor  characters (eg, Irma,  Alex and Pete) are also memorable. They remain  sharply etched in our minds long after they have been written out of the  plot. Irma, arguably Scully's saviour, may be a damaged soul but she  possesses the essence of humanity absent from the sophisticated but  calculating Jennifer. &quot;The Riders&quot; is such a rare and haunting  beauty of a novel I can only recommend other readers to take their time  enjoying it.

Lurie had me in her spell right from the opening chapter where I was struck by her sureness of touch  and intuitive understanding of the workings of the human heart. Her sense  of humour is so honest and spot-on it's uncanny. She had me in stitches no  sooner than Vinnie Miner boarded the plane and found to her dismay the  unlikeliest of travelling companions seated next to her and determined to  make conversation. Lurie's protagonists, Vinnie Miner and Fred Turner, are  both living, breathing individuals everyone recognises. They aren't  &quot;types&quot; but real people, not particularly distinguished or  virtuous, with insecurities, but nevertheless people you feel compassion  for. Vinnie and Fred are thrown together, sharing the same broad social  milieu and developing romantic attachments with the unlikeliest of liasons.  Of the two, Vinnie's story is by far the more convincing and successful. It  is also heartwarming and touching. In contrast, Fred's liason is a little  bland and one dimensional but saved by a dark twist at the end which I  won't give away.  &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; has to be Lurie's  masterpiece. It is a truly delightful and exceptional literary achievement  by a novelist whose trademark is a graceful old school charm that's so rare  to find these days. It richly deserves its Pulitzer Prize winning status  and I would recommend it to anyone who reads to be moved and entertained.	2000-03-23

The story of a father offering the hand of his daughter in marriage to  the man able to correctly name all the eucalyptus trees in his orchard, has  the makings of a fascinating premise for a fable. Bail's intimate knowledge  of the Australian outbacks and well researched command of his subject is  certainly impressive but to the non-native reader seems only overindulgent.  Compounding the difficulty for me was the obscurity of his language and his  vision. His sentences don't flow. Neither does his thought process, which  makes reading the novel a jerky and uneven experience. His characters  (Ellen and her father, Holland) are curiously underwritten. We don't  understand what goes on in their minds and cannot empathise or like them.  The fable remains ultimately an enigma. Even the wooing of Ellen by the  unnamed lover with a stream of fantastic but unconnected stories as they  encircle and cavort with each other from tree to tree became hard work and  tedious for me. A fellow online reviewer helpfully explained that these  stories all hinted at unfulfilled love but I can't say they made that  connection when they tumbled into my consciousness. I realise the reviews  of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; from both critics and public alike have been  wildly ecstatic. I only wish I felt the same but I don't. I found it a less  than pleasurable read - disappointing and obscure. Sorry.	2000-03-12
US	52572105	R22KJBS5HROCMY	0140255249	996403615	Shadow Dance	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A different but impressive first novel	&quot;Shadow Dance&quot; is purportedly an atypical Angela Carter novel. It isn't about a make-believe world of magic and fantasy that's ruled by freaks and half humans but starkly rooted in the crumbling order of lower  class society in an unnamed English town where bloody minded beatniks,  thieves and loafers are the dominant human specimen. Carter's first novel  is boldly contemporary, dealing with issues confronting a society that's  undergoing a radical change of values and throwing its inhabitants into a  perpetual state of anomie, where the old sits uncomfortably alongside the  new. Hence, you have poor old Edna driving Morris bonkers with her resident  martyr act which only serves to unleash the lurking cruelty beneath the  subterranean of his mind. Contrast this with  Emily's ruthless and  singleminded focus on the here and now. Honeybuzzard's criminal instincts  and his lack of moral centre is both frightening and damning in its  implications for a society still finding its new equilibrium. Even Morris,  Honeybuzzard's alter ego and quite the only character with any conscience  at all capitulates and abandons his quest for justice. &quot;Shadow  Dance&quot; is an impressive first novel by the celebrated Carter. Her  heady and razor sharp facility with words lends that extra zing to this  coming-of-age tale of cruelty. It won't be long before I tackle one of her  later works which promises to be different but equally entertaining.	2000-03-06

The unifying factor is Hanna Malter, a  young girl growing up in the small town of Burgdorf amidst a seemingly  large and disparate cast of characters who in one way or another shape her  childhood experiences. These stories tell of idiosyncracies, deformities,  illegimacy, masochism, incest, dark premonitions, murder, suicide, madness,  magic and healing, but in the most gentle, lyrical and dream like way  possible, ie a million miles away from the cheap sensationalism common to  purveyors of pulp fiction. Each story is complete in itself and without  exception, beautifully told. Readers of this wonderful collection of  vignettes is going to have his own personal favourites. Therein lies the  fun - it's like choosing from a box of chocolates. There is a pervading  sense of sadness in these tales which spring from the religious limitations  and provincial-mindedness of a society on the fringe, but you're never  conscious of it until it's over and you get the chance to reflect on it.  Hegi's talent and integrity as a writer is self evident in the way she has  achieved the near impossible, that of transforming characters with the  makings of a grotesque into believable human beings. The result is a poetic  and strangely uplifting novel that is a joy to read. Highly recommended.	2000-03-05
US	52572105	R2CUVTHVQJBTRP	0385494149	801233492	Enduring Love: A Novel	Books	5	6	6	N	N	First chapter is worth the price of the book	&quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; spooked me out so bad I was afraid of my own shadows days after I'd read it. Such is the genius of Ian McEwan's craft in the genre of psycho suspense thrillers. That essential quality of  &quot;darkness&quot;, which has become a McEwanian trademark, is very much  evident in &quot;Enduring Love&quot; but in surprising ways. Jed Parry's  sudden obsession and stalking of Joe Rose is every bit as scary as the  looming threat and encircling of the young visiting couple by the decadent  older couple in TCOS. In &quot;Enduring Love&quot;, the path chosen by  McEwan to the heart of darkness is altogether different but stunning in its  brilliance, the occurrence of a shock event that triggers off an emotional  response that is menacing in its obsession and indifference to the havoc it  creates to the lives of its victims. The now famous first chapter of  &quot;Enduring Love&quot; is quite the most mesmerising piece of fictional  writing, ever. The horror of the balloon accident is so vividly drawn and  captured by McEwan's cleanly precise prose the scene remains firmly etched  in your mind long after the action has moved on to another place. The  &quot;high&quot; experienced in the opening chapter is so acute that what  follows must inevitably seem anticlimatic. But what's surprising is that  the novel veers off in a direction nobody could have anticipated after the  heartstopping beginning, which on hindsight seems to be a kind of red  herring. But that's a false charge. The real subject of novel isn't, to my  mind, even about the effects of the de Clerambault disease but the  fragility of the human condition, the absence of any solid foundation that  underpins our self definition, and the ferocity of our self preservation  instincts that lie buried within us, all ready to be sparked off by the  unexpected. McEwan's expose on human frailty is painfully honest and may  make some of us uncomfortable but the message seems to be that with self  awareness, there is hope. &quot;Enduring Love&quot; is such a thrilling  captivating read I guarantee you'd want to finish it in one sitting. It's  quite the most entertaining novel I've read in a long time. Absolutely  brilliant !	2000-02-29
US	52572105	R3ABZMR9H9FDNB	0679781277	682628461	Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer	Books	3	29	34	N	N	Unfettered ambition - the &quot;secret malady of the ages&quot;	Steven Millhauser's &quot;Martin Dressler&quot; may not be worthy of the hype surrounding its Pulitzer Prize winning status but it's gotten more  flak than it deserves. As a novel, it's strangely one dimensional and  therefore disappointing, dull even. There isn't much of a storyline to  speak of - Martin simply takes on successively bigger projects until he  finally overeaches himself - and the characters (including Martin) are all  bloodless, cardboard-like stick characters, sleepwalking (ironically, like  Caroline) through their parts. Sure, the attention paid to periodic detail  is meticulous and impressive but unless you're an afficionado of late 20th  century artifacts, chances are that you'll find most of it rather tedious.  That's not to say Millhauser's scene setting techniques isn't beautifully  executed. It is - his descriptive prose is vivid and flawless  but...indulgent. There were moments when I thought the plot was about to  take off for some place leftfield but sadly, such promises were never  fulfilled. Even the one heart stopping episode near the end of the novel  wasn't exploited for its full dramatic potential. Martin's relationship  with the Vernon women could have been fascinating had it been allowed to  fuel the plot, but it remained underwritten and undeveloped. There's also  an eerie feeling about the nature and relationship between the two Vernon  sisters that was left unexplored. However, the weaknesses we perceive in  &quot;Martin Dressler&quot; as a novel quickly dissolve when cast in the  fable genre. Fables aren't after all about real life people but about  morality and ideas. Stylistically, there are tell tale signs that suggest  this treatment. For instance, Millhauser's distant and omniscient  perspective of his characters - Martin's self centredness, his casual  lusting over the hotel maid Maria, and his weekly visits to the whores is  narrated in a tone that's entirely devoid of moral judgement. The perfectly  still, never changing and repetitive image of the langourous Caroline  &quot;with her hair pulled tightly back&quot; too has a fairy tale like and  slightly spooky quality about it. Readers of &quot;Martin Dressler&quot;  are advised to approach it as a fable to avoid disappointment. Despite its  weaknesses, there were moments in there which I truly enjoyed. My verdict ?  Not the masterpiece to write home about. Neither is it the dud it is made  out to be.	2000-02-27

In the  character of Patrick &quot;Pussy&quot; Braden, McCabe has found the perfect  metaphor for a troubled Ireland. Just as the Irish struggle to define their  identity in a climate of political strife and conflict, Pussy yearns to be  reunited with his mother (a dead ringer for Mitzi Gaynor) but seethes with  hatred and plots revenge on his father (no pun intended) whose identity  remains a secret to all but the reader. Like his country, Pussy is sexually  and emotionally in no man's land. His life as a transvestite, who does  smashing impersonations of 60s English divas Dusty Springfield and Lulu,  mirrors the pain and confusion of the times. McCabe's novel is a collage of  incidents and minor sequences which flash back and forth in time to produce  a criss cross matisse of images which somehow hang together. Short bursts  of shocking violence alternate with dreamy ruminations of the past (mostly  about Pussy's origins). As a satirist, McCabe's command of the genre shines  through the use of a rapid fire tongue-in-cheek style to great effect.  &quot;Breakfast On Pluto&quot; is truly deserving of its Booker Prize  nomination. It is a massive literary achievement and will be enjoyed by all  who read to be entertained and more !	2000-02-26

As a one time quarry man turned novelist, Parks writes with rare  authority about a geologist called Peter Nicolson who is sent to a  Mediterranean island to inspect a granite quarry whose product for an  Australian project has resulted in the &quot;accidental&quot; death of a  construction worker. Using the language of geology and images drawn from  the world of mineralogy (eg, shear, quartz, feldspar, etc), Parks scores  with a gripping thriller that has you on the edge of your seat all through  its 210 pages. The pace doesn't let up, in fact gathers pace until it  delivers a shattering climax at the very end. The words &quot;there was  evil in the rocks&quot; early in the novel sets the tone for what ensues.  The philandering protagonist(Peter) isn't exactly a sympathetic character.  He is unfaithful to his pregnant wife from a marriage gone stale, yet  thinks nothing of cheating on his travelling companion mistress while on  his investigative mission. In the course of his five-day stay on the  island, Peter finds himself equally subject to the effects of  &quot;shear&quot; that granite slabs are exposed to in their voyage to  their final destination. Even the moral choices that Peter is confronted  with each step of the way are tainted by motives which are suspect. Without  spoiling the fun for readers of this highly ingenious and dazzlingly  written suspense novel, I can only say that &quot;Shear&quot; is  entertainment of the first order and noboby who has read it will feel  disappointed.	2000-02-12

If I had to describe in a word or a phrase what the novel is about, I'd say it's about the nature of  love. Does love between human beings share the same source as that between  Man and his creator ? The question of faith and Catholicism in particular  has long been a favourite theme of Greene's and here he digs deep and mines  it to the fullest. The novel's unique structure and way the love story  between Maurice and Sarah is told with multiple flashbacks gives it an  expansive romantic sweep that lends itself to cinematic adaptation. I have  yet to see the film version but if it succeeds in capturing the essence of  the novel, it promises to be breathtaking. Oddly enough, I detect shades of  the grand love affair between Count Almasey and Katherine Clifton in  &quot;The English Patient&quot;. Just when you think the novel has reached  its emotional climax, Greene surprises by going the extra mile to infuse  the denouement with a deeply religious flavour that is simply brilliant.  The execution is deftly handled, never threatening to overload the love  story with heavy duty meaning. &quot;The End Of The Affair&quot; makes for  wonderful reading. Don't miss it !	2000-02-07

Expecting a gentler and kinder place than  his abode across the Atlantic, Dan discovers to his surprise that life has  thrown a few curved balls at his buddies in the intervening years. His best  friend, Gary, has lost his mind and now lives in a world of his own,  imagining himself a descendent of a red Indian tribe. His ex-girlfriend,  Gloria, has lost a teenage daughter (whom she claims was fathered by Dan)  to a serial killer. Even the past, as he recalls it, doesn't quite  reconcile with their version. As Dan treads the path of self discovery, he  realises that there is no real logic to life. Is Gary's spiritual domain,  in which life and death co-exist in a continuum, so absurd ? Perhaps not.  How about Gloria's insistence in Dan's paternity when this belief flies in  the face of all evidence ? Cartwright's prose reeks with irony. He writes  in a very readable style, though the proliferation of names and places only  served to distract. There are at least two high points in the novel. Dan's  interview with the serial killer is chilling and brilliant in its economy.  Gary's well thought out plan for Dan to regain lost antiques from the  British Museum is touching in its quiet intent and a masterful stroke. I  found &quot;Leading The Cheers&quot; a very good read. Highly recommended.	2000-02-04

It is, in short, a gem, a rare find that defies easy categorisation. Shields combines elements of several literary genres to  create a landmark that is simply resplendent in all its glory. Mary Swann,  an obscure rural poet who was brutally murdered by her husband in 1965,  suddenly emerges as the latest discovery some decades later and becomes a  fixation with the publishing and scholarly community in Canada. Four  individuals, a scholar (Sarah Maloney), a biographer (Morton Jimroy), a  publisher (Frederic Cruzzi) and a librarian (Rose Hindmarch), working  separately on Swann's legacy, are brought together by their common  obsession. Examining the part each of them plays in unrevelling the Swann  mystery, Shields explores the nature of art and the recurring theme of  &quot;appearance and reality&quot; to great effect. The scholastic  community look in vain for &quot;literary influences&quot; in Swann's  sparse but granite hard jewels. Is it so inconceivable that this cowering  nothing of a woman is capable of creating art &quot;without  influences&quot; ? The value ascribed to manuscripts by scholars and  publishers is also questioned. Are they not merely the physical  manifestation of the final product and not the genius of creation which is  of the moment and incapable of being captured and saved for scrutiny and  analysis. Shields also displays her brilliant sense of irony in her  characterisation. Sarah, for all her feminist ideals, marries not her lover  (Brownie) but the well heeled Stephen and finds herself on the way to  becoming a Mum. Who would have thought that the pompous and superior  Morton, celebrated biographer of Ezra Pound, is sexually impotent, unable  to relate to women in the flesh but imagines himself to be in love with  Sarah ? The novel also crackles throughout with an almost cruel sense of  humour, particularly in the dialogue sequence between Mortonand Rose which  is so funny it borders on the ridiculous. All the threads are neatly drawn  together in the final segment where Shields delivers her coup-de-grace in a  climax resembling a Miss Marple type thriller. With customary wit and  charm, Shields has produced a minor masterpiece in &quot;Swann&quot;. It is  so good you would want to revisit it again and again. Go read it. I can't  recommend it more highly.	2000-01-30

Set in fictional Kangan, Achebe spins a highly intriguing tale of three men who grew up in school together but find themselves  increasingly alienated from one another professionally when one of them  (not the smartest but the smoothest) declares himself President in the  aftermath of the overthrow of the civilian Kangan government. Conflict of  conscience issues generated by moves by the would-be dictator to  consolidate his power over his people threaten to destroy their friendship  and loyalty. It is no longer the white man who is responsible for the  grinding poverty of the masses but the revolutionary fighters whose  corruption and lust for power undermines their cause. Achebe is also  brilliant in his characterisation. Ikem and Chris are vividly drawn and  full bodied personalities, as are Beatrice and Elewe. Even minor characters  like Professor Okong who appears only in the novel remain sharply etched in  one's mind long after they have disappeared from the scene. &quot;Anthills  of the Savannah&quot; remind me a little of V S Naipaul's  &quot;Guerillas&quot; but it is by far a superior work. A thrilling and  highly engaging piece of work by a literary giant.	2000-01-25

It is introspective yet never oblique or indulgent in the way the study of  &quot;interiors&quot; has a tendency to be in lesser hands. For Catherine  McKenna, a struggling music composer estranged from her parents in Belfast  and bringing up her little daughter Anna as a single parent in Glasgow,  music is a celebration and a transmutation of the pulse of ordinary life,  from childbirth pangs to the sounds of nature. There is a beautiful passage  in there which likens the experience of childbirth to an orchestral  performance of a musical composition. The prelude is all but theory and  practice. You have to experience it to understand its relevance and impact.  &quot;Vernicle&quot;, the Mass that Catherine finishes, is inspired by her  life's highs and lows and the product of her adherence to her teacher's  advocacy of the practice of &quot;pre-hearing&quot; and the ability to  catch the &quot;notes between the notes&quot;. MacLaverty has written a  novel that is at once subtle, reflective, poignant and uplifting. It is a  consummate achievement that's worthy of its Booker prize award nomination.

The first third of the novel is undeniably captivating and often  hilarious in its authentic account of Chinese customs and beliefs and in  its characterisation of the various members of the Poon family, from the  loutish Ah Lung to the two unmarried sisters, the elder of whom makes a  thunderous noise when she washes in the morning. Mabel is another  unforgettable character. But as soon as Wallace and May Ling are packed off  to  Mainland China, the pace starts to slacken and I found myself quickly  losing interest. Things didn't improve much even when the scene shifted  back to Hong Kong for the final third of the novel. I found myself skimming  the pages and looking forward to its end. It was a major source of  irritation for me that Mo makes all his characters speak in the weirdest  past tense, an attempt no doubt to capture in dialogue the ungrammatical  English used by Hongkongers, but it only comes across as cute and  condescending. &quot;The Monkey King&quot; reads like the real thing for  the most part but is ultimately disappointing.	2000-01-16

His prose is dazzling and vivid but difficult to negotiate, consisting as it does of a torrent of words conveying so many images it's sometimes hard to follow. Its updated stream  of consciousness style left me giddy and breathless, not always a  pleasurable experience when you have to re-read large tracts to get the  meaning. Non-American readers like me may find the colloquilism and some of  the references difficult to connect with, but that limitation is mine  alone. The novel's premise is fascinating. Stephen hears the moon urging  him to suicide. He is tempted but hesitates, then goes home to murder his  wife. Hard as nails (Mailer implies that's the only way to survive in New  York City), Stephen's self protective instincts rises to the fore to help  him make it through the murder investigation and the much anticipated  confrontation with his father-in-law, but not without a good dose of tender  loving care administered by a moll named Cherry. Naturally, Stephen escapes  death yet again but guess who pays for it ? &quot;An American Dream&quot;  is Mailer's masculine and testosterone-charged account of sex, politics,  corruption and sleaze in the Big Apple. It is a highly impressive piece of  work but I confess to being a little out of my depth with the lyricism  which I found excessive.	2000-01-06

Edna O'Brien has written a novel so bleak and despairing I'd call it a book to cut your wrists by. Is the experience of womanhood all about pain, deprivation and loss ? Is there no joy in the bargain ? You wouldn't think  so, judging by the experience of Nell. The cruelty of her husband drives  her to seek emotional refuge in her two sons but when they leave the nest,  she turns in desperation to a series of unreliable lovers who bring her  more misery. The relentless feeling of despair beating upon Nell reaches  its climax when she loses Paddy, but by then, the reader is too numb to  care. It doesn't help that O'Brien's prose is often dense and turgid. Some  critics call it poetic or lyrical, which may be so, but the jerkiness of  some of the episodes (eg, in the middle section, with her lovers) makes the  narrative difficult to follow. It is sometimes even hard to tell who she's  writing about. Her characterisation is also weak, though this may be  deliberate. O'Brien isn't interested in anybody other than Nell. The  supporting cast of characters are only there to help create the soundtrack  playing through Nell's mind. The message that O'Brien delivers on  motherhood isn't redemptive either. Paddy's and Tristan's alienation from  Nell is, not surprisingly, reminiscent of Nell's estrangement from her own  mother. The horror of Nell's emotional existence reaches a crescendo  when  she stares at a half crazed baglady one day on the streets and sees the  ravaged face of her once young housemaid, Rita. There is no more powerful  image depicting the madness and despair that will take hold of Nell.  &quot;Time and Tide&quot; is emotionally exhausting to read. It isn't quite  the artistic failure it is made out to be, but O'Brien could have lightened  her touch a tad ! This is not a book for everyone.	2000-01-02

Llosa uses the premise of a murder mystery to explore the theme of innocence and guilt in a  society that's so ridden with corruption that the concept of justice is all  but an illusion. There is no sense of relief in the denouement when the  truth is told and the identity of the killer is revealed. Just like Alicia,  the Colonel's daughter, the people of Talara suffer from permanent  delusion, preferring to ignore the facts and attribute all of society's  ills to &quot;the big boys&quot;. Lituma is Lieutenant Silva's foil but  also Llosa's voice. Through his ruminations and asides, Llosa articulates  his horror of corruption and racism that permeate Peruvian life. Never  making heavy weather of serious themes, Llosa infuses the novel with such  sidesplitting humour you can't help but revel in Silva's obsessive lust  over the voluptuous Dona Adriana. His sense of comedy and intuitive grasp  of what's funny is displayed none more convincingly than in the final scene  when the lady turns the tables on Silva. This is definitely one of the most  captivating and enjoyable books I have read all year. Don't miss it !	1999-12-24
US	52572105	R6E66ZEB9E70H	0393316009	392180722	Ship Fever: Stories	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A fascinating blend of science, nature and life	Andrea Barrett's &quot;Ship Fever and Other stories&quot; is such a rare literary treasure you'd want to take your time tasting and savouring every  morsel of  delight these vignettes release. Barrett draws upon her expert  knowledge of nature, history and the sciences to create a fascinating  subtext over which the private lives and heroic struggles of men (and  women) of science are interwoven and told. The stories are not all of equal  or impeccable quality. &quot;Ship Fever&quot; is the most outstanding,  though others like &quot;The Littorol Zone&quot;, &quot;Rare Bird&quot; and  &quot;The Behaviour of the Hawkweeds&quot; are also truly excellent. Even  the mediocre ones like &quot;Soroche&quot; come laden with such a generous  dose of human interest you overlook their weaknesses. Barrett may write  about scientists, but not as a breed apart. Her characters are multifaceted  and always interesting. They live, love and fight just like the rest of us.  Through these stories, Barrett expose the hypocrisy and double standards  that dog women and scientists in 19th Century society. Sexual politics, the  relevance and responsibility of men of science and their contribution to  public good are common themes that recur throughout. <br />In &quot;Ship  Fever&quot;, Suzanne Rowling is handicapped by her sex but emerges  victorious when she overcomes social barriers to nurse the sick at the cost  of her own life. Dr Lauchlin Grant discovers true humanity only when he  leaves the middle class comfort of his home for Grosse Isle to fight the  terrible plague and dies from it, but not before saving Nora Kynd's life.  Nora's last act in honour of Lauchlin's memory is one of the most touching  moments in &quot;Ship Fever&quot;.  Contrast these lives with Arthur Adam  Rowling's, still writing, reporting and shaping public opinion, seemingly  untouched by the death and disease which has devastated his family and  reached his doorsteps, or his servants', whose humanity lies dormant till  the very end. <br />Barrett's beautifully judged and precise descriptive prose  is strangely evocative, like the lingering fragrance of bouquet from good  wine. Reading this book is such a pleasurable experience you don't want it  to end. &quot;Ship Fever and Other Stories&quot; is a great literary  achievement and truly deserving of the National Book Award. Don't miss it !	1999-12-23

Captured almost exclusively in dialogue, the celebrated Doyle may be giving us a real slice of Irish working class life,  but I didn't enjoy one moment of it. Perhaps the setting is too alien to  me. The profanities that litter the lines and the heavy of vernacular may  be authentic and true to the milieu, but I found it all too much.

The story of the Tulls is for the most part unexceptional. But  it is from this ordinariness that the  novel derives its strength. Real life is for most people about coping. All  the Tulls are dysfunctional in their own ways. Beck, the father, deserts  his family and it is tempting to believe he is the cause of all their  troubles. By the end of the story, you're not so sure. Pearl, the mother,  is run ragged bringing up the children on her own but she is no saint. She  resorts to abuse which scars the children (albeit to different degrees).  Cody, the eldest, develops such severe hangups over his father's desertion  and his mother's display of  favouritism he becomes emotionally estranged  from the family. His resentment of his younger brother borders on cruelty  and is painful to read. Sister Jenny, also a victim of abuse by her mother,  grows up scatty and remote. Ezra, the gentlest of the three children and  owner of the &quot;Homesick Restaurant&quot; is the most sympathetically  drawn character but even then, there is a feeling of defeat and being  thwarted about his whole life. There are no saints, heroes or villains in  the novel,only ordinary men and women who are different shades of grey.  There are two scenes in the novel which are specially poignant. One is  where Pearl in her old age relives one captured moment of happiness from an  old diary. Another is where Beck returns momentarily for a family reunion  at Ezra's &quot;Homesick Restaurant&quot; on the occasion of Pearl's  funeral. The reunion is, like all of Ezra's earlier attempts, a failure.  But Tyler seems to be saying perhaps it doesn't matter after all . Not  ultimately, since failure is an integral part of family life. Like Pearl's  memory of her youthful past, it's living that makes us human. Reading this  novel won't change your life. But it will add to it.	1999-12-18

I didn't much care for it......	&quot;The Collector&quot; is touted as a masterpiece of a modern psychological thriller. Well, having read it from cover to cover, I found I didn't much care for it. The first part of the novel, narrated from Clegg's  point of view, was tedious and boring. It wasn't even remotely enlightening  or explanatory in any meaningful way of Clegg's twisted pysche. The long  second chapter sprang a surprise and for awhile I was hopeful that things  would improve and it did. We get introduced to Miranda and her friends and  begin to understand that she is the anathema to Clegg. She, the art  student, stands for life, passion and freedom while Clegg, the office  clerk, tries to capture a slice of life by bottling and freeze framing it  for observation. But I soon tired of Miranda's oscillating moods and  tirades. This second chapter is written in a style which is compatible with  the image of Miranda struggling like a butterfly while pinned down to the  collector's showcase. By then, I couldn't wait for the book to end. When it  finally did, I was all too relieved. The ending seemed predictable enough.  I didn't quite mourn for Miranda but the thought that the entire episode  was going to start all over again with the next victim sent chills up my  spine. Despite the accolades heaped on &quot;The Collector&quot;, I didn't  enjoy it. A disappointment !	1999-12-10

But what's remarkable about it is that Oates has  transformed this &quot;faction&quot; into a beautiful ballad. The  happenings of that fateful night when the black Toyota plunged headlong  into the swampy river is told through the eyes of the drowning girl.  There's a sense of real pathos in the telling cos it's painfully obvious  the girl's impressed with the Senator for the wrong reasons and that he's a  cad. The manner of the Senator's escape from the capsized car and his cruel  abandonment of her as she awaits hopelessly for her own rescue is a wrench  to read. The novel reads like a poem in parts. Maybe there's a song in  there somewhere, with a verse, a chorus and a middle eight. By using the  drowning girl's vantage viewpoint, Oates has created a powerful masterpiece  that's so wonderfully compelling it bears reading over and over again.  Truly great stuff !	1999-12-09

Is it &quot;art for art's sake&quot; or  does the artist have an implied obligation to hold a mirror to the burning  issues of his day ? Through a series of flashbacks into the life of pre-war  artist Masuji Ono, the novel also deals with the issue of moral courage and  the ability to confront the past without denying one's convictions. The  language employed by Ishiguro in his prose and dialogue is formal but  entirely congruous with his subject. Ono is in disgrace with the post-war  generation who blame artists, politicians and businessmen for their  suffering as Japan struggles to recover from the ravages of the disastrous  war. His association with the imperialist movement exacts a toll on the  personal happiness of his unmarried daughter, Noriko, his former pupil and  protege Kuroda desert him, but unlike the unprincipled Shintaro who is  willing to recant his past beliefs to get ahead, Ono holds his own, yet  shows great courage in breaking away from his master's tradition to paint a  picture depicting squalor amidst plenty in contemporary society. Ishiguro's  novel is simply  brilliant and deserving of the accolades lavished on it.  Highly recommended.	1999-11-29

His works come recommended  as that of an important modern writer. Apart from his award winning debut  &quot;Family Dancing&quot; which focussed on a myriad of dysfunctionality  in modern families, his subsequent novels and short stories have (I am  told) been exclusively about gay life. &quot;Arkansas - Three  Novellas&quot; is no different. It is purportedly also his most daring.  Though graphic and explicit in some of its sex scenes, it is never  pornographic. Leavitt has such a natural and easy writing style his prose  never comes across forced. Neither does his plots seem contrived. Of the  three novellas, &quot;The Term Paper Artist&quot; work best. It is both  touching and funny. I found myself laughing through most of it. &quot;The  Wooden Anniversary&quot; is also great. The twist at the end is simply  ingenius. This makes me want to read its prequel in one of Leavitt's  earlier short story collections. However, &quot;Saturn Street&quot; isn't  quite as good. I found the story shallow and unconvincing. If  &quot;Arkansas - Three Novellas&quot; is anything to go by, Leavitt is a  writer that will appeal to readers of all persuasion. His stories and are  both entertaining and enjoyable.	1999-11-28
US	52572105	R2R9JFZOVJDXCE	0140167943	988777649	Fifth Business (Deptford Trilogy)	Books	5	40	42	N	N	An enchanting saga told in great story telling tradition	I had never heard of Robertson Davies until I discovered &quot;Fifth Business&quot;, the first instalment of the &quot;Deptford Trilogy&quot;,  from a recommended book list and what a great reading experience it turned  out to be. Davies writes in a style highly reminiscent of the great late  19th and early 20th century writers. Strongly narrative, the novel is  richly multilayered in its exploration of ideas and themes. At its most  basic level, it is the story of the sensitive but oddly passive Dunstan  Ramsey, the novel's protaganist, whose life is contrasted with his  pragmatic and successful friend, Boy Staunton and his women (including  Leola, his wife who turns out not to be made of the same stuff as Boy).  Whilst Dunstan seems content to live life as a school master, observing  rather than participating, Boy makes waves and becomes a hugely successful  figure in business and politics. But more fascinating is the early traces  of &quot;magical realism&quot; used by Davies in the Mary Dempster (the  &quot;fool-saint&quot;) episode, which manifests the nature of Dunstan's  conscience (contrasting with the lack thereof in Boy) as well as his belief  in the power of magic and imagination. In the development of this secondary  plot line, Davies employs a technique that hints at &quot;magical  realism&quot; but wields his craft with such confidence and aplomb that the  effect can only be described as dazzling. Dunstan's feeling of  responsibility towards Mary and her son Paul is brought to a beautiful  conclusion when he learns much later after Paul runs away from home and  assumes the identity of a magician that it was he (Dunstan) who had taught  him (Paul) the rudiments of magic through the card game. The shock ending  for Boy smacks of poetic justice, leaving the question metaphysically open  ended. Boy may be the protaganist on the world's stage and Dunstan only  &quot;fifth business&quot;, but who's ultimately the more valuable human  being ? Davies has written a brilliant and enchanting novel. For sure I'll  be checking out the next two instalments of his trilogy.	1999-11-13

I guess I was prepared for the brooding pleasure that one might expect to derive from reading a sad  contemplative piece but the experience totally surpassed my expectations.  Brookner's facility with words is simply masterful. Her writing is precise,  unpretentious, honest and true. Her characters are vividly drawn and always  memorable. Contrary to the blurb, this novel is not about a friendship  between two women. It is a tale of a thwarted and unfulfilled life, that of  Fay's. Her relationship with the monstrous Julia cannot be considered a  friendship by any imagination. With friends like Julia, who needs enemies ?  Fay is bound to Julia only by a sense of obligation born of low self esteem  and guilt pangs stemming from a midlife affair with Charlie. Julia, on the  other hand, is a totally self-centred and imperious caricature of the  former movie star she was and treats everybody including her husband, her  household staff and her &quot;friends&quot; like Fay exactly the same way.  There is no evidence of any valid basis for friendship between the two  women, not that I can discern anyway. As seen through the eyes of Fay, the  three men in Fay's life (Owen, Charlie and Alex) are  all vapid and  colourless characters deserving of the fate that awaits them - two of them  get bumped off unexpectedly. The recurring question in the reader's mind is  whether all men in Fay's world are as inherently remote emotionally as they  seem or are they simply reacting to Fay's insecurity and inability to  articulate her own needs. She is among the last of that dying breed of  women from the old world who depend on their menfolk for self definition.  She realises in time (but more from fortituous events than from the dawn of  self  enlightenment) the futility of this condition. As the men drop off  like flies, she recoups a measure of resolve and dignity from within  herself to lead the rest of her twilight years in a state of modest  independence. Even the bullying Julia gets packed off to Spain. So the  story ends on a note of hope as Fay contemplates a solitary life but this  time without the people who have unconsciously conspired to make her feel  undervalued. Brookner has produced a near masterpiece in this introspective  study of a woman's life. Unless you're allergic to this genre of novels, I  would highly recommend &quot;Brief Lives&quot; to all lovers of literature.  It is truly a beautifully crafted piece of work.	1999-11-06

The characters  (Sonny, Duane, Jacy, Ruth, Herman, Lois, Sam, etc) all seem so true to life  you find yourself caring about them as they suck you into their  sex-obsessed world of teenage lust and adult disappointments. Sonny and  Duane mistake Jacy for the glittering prize she is not and pay for it in  their own ways. Jacy is manipulative, shallow and heartless and easily the  most despicable character (perhaps after Herman) but even then, you feel  pity rather than hatred for her. The miserable lives of Ruth and Lois lend  a deep sense of pathos to the story. Life is &quot;no win&quot; in this  small Texan town. You never forget the bleakness of the lives of this  ensemble cast of characters in small town America but not for one moment do  you feel weighed down by a sense of dreariness which seems to afflict  novels of this genre. McMurtry's easy writing style and his sparkling wit  and humour, all conspire to lighten the mood and keep the reader in rapt  attention throughout. He never makes heavy weather of serious themes and  though his works (including TLPS) are studied today as literature, it is so  accessible and incredibly enjoyable you never feel it is hard work. Such is  the talent of McMurtry. The next thing I'm going to do is check out the  award winning movie version which McMurtry had a hand in making and is  considered one of the classic movies of the early 70s. One of the most  enjoyable novels I have read this year. Highly recommended.	1999-10-31

The  Contemporary Reading List recommended &quot;The Summer Before The  Dark&quot; as an alternative and I wasn't disappointed. The novel starts  off promisingly with a vividly drawn portrait of a 45 year-old middle class  Englishwoman (Kate Brown) at the crossroads of her life. Realising that she  has devoted most of her adult life to her husband (Michael) and children  without a thought for herself, she sets out tentatively on a journey of  self discovery when decides she doesn't like whom she sees in the mirror.  She throws herself into a temporary job translating for a global food  conference, which leads to an affair with a younger man (Jeffery) and  culminates in a startling confrontation with herself when she gets to know  a young girl (Maureen) whom she shares temporary accomodation with while  her family is away. Maureen may not know what she wants to be (she has  proposals from suitors of all persuasion) but what she does know is that  she doesn't want to end up like Kate and her own mother. While her good  friend, the selfish and amoral Mary, isn't a role model, she has always  retained that sense of self that has gone missing from Kate's life. A large  part of Lessing's prose consists of internal monologue, words and responses  from Kate's mind and soul, all tremulously spoken. The recurring dream  sequence with the &quot;seal&quot; is deeply poignant and symbolic of  Kate's search for her own identity. The novel is a wonderful example of  feminist literature exploring issues that will have eternal relevance for  women all over the world. Lessing's beautifully written prose often leaves  me breathless. Read it !	1999-10-27

Unlike a conventional  mystery thriller which focuses on the &quot;who done what to whom&quot;  aspect of the storyline, Auster turns the table on the reader by taking him  on a journey of self discovery past a hall of mirrors which reflect and  expose by stages the psyche of the pursuer, not the pursued. The effect is  so spooky you want to scream in your head as you encounter the next slice  of reality about yourself. Readers familiar with the music of rock star  David Bowie will find the reading experience similar to that of listening  to his 1977 album &quot;Low&quot;, a dark and creepy introspective piece of  work. All three vignettes deal with questions of identity, reality and  illusion, the meaning of words and language and explores the fine line  between commitment and obsession. Both Quinn in &quot;City of Glass&quot;  and the anonymous narrator in &quot;Ghosts&quot; are trapped in their own  circumstances and forced to make human choices which lead to their mental  breakdown. There is also a noir-like cinematic feel about the trilogy that  just begs for this masterful piece of work to be brought to the screen.  Auster has produced a highly original post-modern thriller that will  mesmerise and enthrall readers for years to come. It is simply superb and I  cannot recommend it highly enough.	1999-10-25

The story of Wade Whitehouse, the  novel's protaganist, is told through the eyes of his younger brother,  Rolfe. Unlike Wade, who is trapped and left flailing in his natural  habitat, Rolfe manages to break free and joins the teaching profession in  middle class acedemia. While alienated from one another and leading  separate lives, they emerge like two complementary halves in their  emotional core and are in fact alter egos to one another. Wade is the  exterior and Rolfe the interior half of a single persona. Ironies abound to  suggest this reading. Whilst the unsympathetic Wade still cares enough  about justice and punishment to pursue Jack whom he believes is responsible  for Twombley's death, Rolfe has become emotionally barren, interested only  in observing and recording events in their families' lives. At the same  time, Wade is unfavourable compared with Battle Lloyds who is physically  maimed but remain positive as a person. The pain and bleakness of Wade's  life is made especially poignant in a nightmare sequence depicting a man  with a crying child, a guilty reminder of his failure as a father to Jill.  The story's tragic ending is laden with a palpable sense of the absurd.  Wade kills his father in self defence but nobody will know this. He shoots  Jack in the name of misplaced justice and then disappears not realising  that Twombley's death was really the result of an accident. This strangely  perverse comic twist that comes with the ending destabilies the novel in my  view and leaves the reader with a funny after taste. While the movie  version is faithful to the novel (Nick Nolte turns in a great performance  as Wade) in narrative terms, it fails to deal with the subtler issues  explored by Banks in his book. There is a sureness of touch and genuineness  in Banks' writing that makes this is an interesting and compelling read.	1999-10-24

It is to my mind the most outstanding novel I have read this year. Nobody who loves serious fiction  or literature should miss it. It is THAT good. I can only surmise that  Cunningham is a follower of Virgina Woolf. He is so imbued with her spirit  that his prose reads almost like hers. His uncanny grasp of her  &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style lends a special resonance to the  exploration of the &quot;interior lives&quot; of three women from different  times who share a common predicament, that of a disconcerting dislocation  from their external existence. There's Virgina Woolf, the author of  &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; and central inspiration for the novel ; Laura  Brown from a later age who reads &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; to escape the  crushing nihilism of her domesticity and unconvincing contentment ; and  Clarissa Vaughn, the modern day reincarnation of Woolf's celebrated  heroine. While &quot;The Hours&quot; is a tour-de-force in its own right,  my own enjoyment of it was so greatly enhanced by my familiarity with its  source that I can only recommend fellow readers to first read the Woolf  classic for inspiration before taking the plunge. The recurring theme of  suicide, madness and sexual ambiguity as they are explored in the novel  take on a special meaning armed with that understanding. There are two  images which haunt the novel like a great spirit towering over the action -  that from the opening sequence of Virginia calmly filling her pocket with a  stone as she prepares to drown herself in the river and the closing  sequence, where Laura is revealed to be the old woman from the contemporary  story who looks out from the window opposite and witnesses a suicide. The  use of the latter as a technical devise to draw the threads together for  the close is a pure stroke of genius and a masterful sleight of hand ! This  is a brilliant, brilliant piece of work that deserves the widest readership  possible. I would have given it a SIX STAR rating had it been possible.	1999-10-02

It tells of how a fallen monk in his escape from the monastery joins up with a travelling theatre troupe  and in the process helps solve a town murder by performing a morality play  to expose the murderer. There are strong shades of Umberto Eco's &quot;The  Name Of The Rose&quot; in this wonderfully captivating novel, which though  far less ambitious in its aims, is arguably as effective in its delivery.  Unsworth's prose is  simple, unpretentious and uncluttered, yet so  beautifully written with a sureness of touch that renders the overall  effect almost poetic. A highly engaging novel that I would recommend  unreservedly to anyone who enjoys a murder mystery in an unusual setting.	1999-10-01

Told through the eyes of his wife and buddies, the vantage point shifts  from one to the other, as family secrets, private pains, hopes and  aspirations are revealed through their alternating rumination. The dialogue  (if you can describe the barely literate half slurred half spat sentences  that spew from their mouths as dialogue) is authentic and evocative of the  working class milieu. There is also a gentleness and grace about the  reflections of the ensemble cast that lend a special poignance to this  &quot;boys tale&quot;. Though their talk centre on drinking and betting and  male bonding type activities, it is the revelation of their domestic lives  and their problems with wives and children that shape the novel. In as much  as I derived great reading pleasure and would recommend the book highly to  friends, I also found certain aspects of it frustrating. If Swift had been  less obscure and more directly explanatory about some of the characters, it  would have made for a tighter and more satisfying read and deserved a full  five-star rating.	1999-09-30

Her most famous and widely read book is probably &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;. But I wanted to savour something different of Spark's and decided on the highly recommmended  &quot;Momemto Mori&quot;, which is about a bunch of octegenarians being  tormented by an anonymous caller. What reads like a typical detective story  (Agatha Christie style) turns out to be a psycho thriller with a twist. A  dead body does turn up eventually but not before we are nearly  three-quarter way through and even then, the murderer's motive and identity  are both inconsequential and summarily dismissed. By then, you get the  distinct feeling that you have been led up the garden path and that the  threatening anonymous caller is a mere (though brilliant) technical devise  used by the author to draw to the open the secrets of past indiscretions  committed by the book's senior citizen cast. The thought of these oldies  fornicating like minxes in their youth is simply hilarious. As it turns  out, the caller assumes a different voice for each victim of the hoax. It  is this &quot;voice of Death&quot; that triggers off memories of past sins  and indeed action on the part of the characters which moves this psycho  thriller briskly along. Spark, writing with her usual charm and wit, deftly  avoids the danger of the book becoming a &quot;talkie&quot; and for that,  we are grateful. I finished the book in two days. It was a delight !	1999-09-28
US	52572105	RU1RC27WXQXBJ	0060932139	104524934	The Unbearable Lightness of Being	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A richly multilayered novel of ideas	Milan Kundera's &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; is a richly textured novel of ideas on life, love, perspective and politics that find expression through the lives of four people (Tomas, Tereza, Sabine and  Franz) who are themselves connected by the philandering ways of the surgeon  Tomas. The novel uses a complex non-linear time scheme to explore a myriad  of ideas that simply explode into a rainbow of colours that defy  definition. At its most basic level, the story tells of two love stories  that run parallel to one another, both tainted by sexual infidelity and set  in Russian occupied Czech Republic. The film version, which I haven't seen,  must have stuck closely to the narrative. How else could any coherent  visual sense be made of the abundance of philosophical ideas that find such  eloquent expression in the novel ? The exploration of lightness/heaviness,  the central theme that flows through the pages, is all about the meaning or  meaninglessness of human existence, the appreciation of history as a unique  and unrepeatable outcome of a series of accidents, and the absence of any  reliable anchor that we can call upon to judge our own motivations and that  of others. Tomas, the respected surgeon, commits a political faux pas and  loses his job, but finds freedom when he becomes a window cleaner. His long  suffering wife, Tereza, concludes that only  animals (like her beloved dog,  Karenin) can be trusted. Sabine and Franz share a doomed relationship as  they denounce their own natural perspectives in search of opposite values  which they mistakenly consider the genuine article. You get the author's  own political perspective in the chapter entitled &quot;The Grand  March&quot; where he investigates the concept of &quot;kitsch&quot;. The  novel is so abound with ideas - some abstract and nebulous and difficult to  grasp - they make your mind reel in wonder. I get the feeling that with  each read, the reader peels off a new layer to uncover new truths to  satisfy. A beautifully written masterpiece. Highly recommended.	1999-09-26
US	52572105	RQH2NGH9T2R34	0786706791	608881239	The Essence of the Thing: A Novel	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Too lightweight to be considered serious literature	Madeline St John's &quot;The Essence Of The Thing&quot; tells the story of how Nicola copes in the aftermath of an unexpected breakup with her live-in boyfriend Jonathan. The premise of the plot is so basic in terms of human  experience that anybody reading it is going to instantly relate to the  personal trauma and the feeling of pain and incomprehension that take hold  of Nicola and yes, even Jonathan. The novel's main strengths lie in the  honesty and simplicity of St John's writing. Except for those who might  dismiss it as a mildly feminist tinged &quot;woman's book&quot; in which  the male characters are either cads or morons (not counting the gay  Philip), readers might derive casual reading pleasure from this very small  book about a commonplace experience of the heart. But as serious  literature, it doesn't quite stack up. The insights offered by St John  aren't particularly deep or enlightening. Structurally, the novel is also  one-dimensional, making no attempt to raise or explore more complex issues  on life and love. I am amazed that such a small novel was even considered  deserving of a Booker Prize nomination. The selection committee must have  seen something special in it which I didn't. Either that or 1997 was a year  which spawned a poor crop.	1999-09-19
US	52572105	R1RHKXI1YH68Y4	0140274375	68382602	The Underground Man	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A truly  impressive debut by Jackson	Mick Jackson's debut, a part fictional novel based on the life of the Duke of Portland, is one of the best novels I have read this year. It's written in the style of a mystery - the secret is unveiled only in its final pages  - and told through the eyes of the protagonist via his journal entries and  those around him. Jackson is a brilliant writer - his prose is sharp, witty  and even poetic in places and he has that rare ability to hold you  spellbound and on knife's edge as you partake in the unraveling of the  mystery. There are hints along the way but the secret is preserved right  till the very end. A small criticism - I found the middle section dealing  with the Duke's hypochondria a little long and slow. This trips up the  natural velocity of the plot which otherwise moves briskly along. As if to  compensate for this minor hiccup, Jackson's prose tightens up again as he  gives a truly unnerving account of the final stages of the Duke's physical  breakdown. The sharpness and pinpoint accuracy of this descriptive passage  makes your stomach queasy and your knees want to buckle. Jackson's writing  is deceptively simple but it hits you right between the eyes. Beautiful.  Stay tuned. You will hear and read alot more of him. In the meantime, enjoy  this wonderfully sad and terrific novel.	1999-09-18
US	52572105	R2GZHQMFWPJPQ3	0880015829	318982614	The Sheltering Sky	Books	5	13	16	N	N	Alienation  in the Sahara	&quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; is ostensibly a book about the sojourn of three American travellers (Port, Kit &amp; Tunner) in the Sahara desert. As alienation and a growing sense of incomprehension take hold of and tighten  their grip on the travellers' psyche, they fall victim to the strange  cruelty of the desert which takes on the role of the antagonist in this  travellers' tale. It is tempting to imagine that the all-enveloping and  terrifying vastness of the Sahara is the root cause of their troubled  psychological state. If this reflects the conventional reading of the  novel, I beg to differ. I found all three principal characters cold, edgy,  unhappy and ultimately selfish. There is no genuine communication in their  human contact. A pervading sense of alienation clouds their private  thoughts and deliberation. The condescending attitude of the colonialists  (including the Lyles and the French officials) towards the natives and  outsiders is all the more ironical when it becomes apparant that the latter  (eg, the old Jewish couple) is capable of basic human kindness which the  colonialists cannot even begin to comprehend. Despite the long descriptive  passages and occasional denseness of Bowles' prose, I found the novel a  mesmerising read. It is a clearly a literary landmark and one that deserves  to be read over and over again.	1999-09-10
US	52572105	R1UYIYXDUEPK5Q	0140170987	18205728	Changing Places: A Tale of Two Campuses	Books	5	22	23	N	N	A very funny novel and a wonderful read	David Lodge's &quot;Changing Places&quot; had me in stitches. It's such a funny book. The prose is highly readable, crisply written and races along so charmingly that it's hard to put it down once you've started. Although  Philip Swallow and Morris Zapp are drawn from the two contrasting cultures  they symbolise, they are never allowed to degenerate into caricatures. Both  are highly real and believable characters, sharing much the same human  frailties. While Zapp is unashamedly direct, hollow and crass, Swallow is  rather more reserved, diffident, but with the same potential though not the  guts for dishonesty. It is only by &quot;changing places&quot; that they  become themselves, albeit in a different environment. Even the behaviour of  their wives change when subjected to the opposite cultural influences.  Admittedly, the setting of the &quot;exchange&quot; in the late 60s (with  all the references to student protests and pot smoking in university  campuses) has tended to date the book a bit. But who cares, when you derive  such enormous pleasure, laughter and fun from reading what must seem like a  novel for the ages. I can see thousands reading it 50 years into the new  millenium.	1999-09-05
US	52572105	R3AMOEONF2XOC6	0395869463	540961512	The Bookshop	Books	3	3	6	N	N	A subtle tale of provincial manners	Penelope Fitzgerald writes slim novels (usually not more than 150 pages long), many of which have been nominated for the prestigious Booker Prize award. &quot;The Bookshop&quot; was among them. I picked this up at a  second hand bookshop and finished it in a day. Set in the 1950s in the  quaint provincial town of Sussex, Fitzgerald's novel is about how a little  old lady by the name of Florence Green fights to provide the essential  service of a bookshop in her hometown but is finally defeated by the well  heeled and well connected Gamarts who have other plans for the site her  bookshop occupies. Though virtually without any action or plot, &quot;The  Bookshop&quot; is a well judged and subtle piece of writing which is likely  to appeal only to &quot;serious readers&quot;. The subject matter and the  whole setting are just too esoteric and too quaint to attract a mass  readership. I for one won't be out scouring the bookshops for another  Fitzgerald novel to read - not quite so soon anyway - if &quot;The  Bookshop&quot; is anything to go by. It may be a gentle and evocative  little thing but not a novel for all seasons. It's just too slow and (on a  bad day) even a little dull.	1999-09-05
US	52572105	R3F8DB8C2YH87O	0679731741	821996423	Guerrillas	Books	3	6	8	N	N	A tale of violence and cruelty	I was keen to check out V S Naipaul. His declared masterpiece, &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot;, seemed the natural place to start but its length put me off. So I decided on &quot;Guerrillas&quot;, which according to  David Rubel's &quot;The Reading List : Contemporary Fiction&quot;, was  widely praised and did much to expand Naipaul's readership in the United  States. It had as its theme a subject which intrigued me - an exploration  of the white man's (outsider's) liberal view of third world politics and  why it is ultimately ineffectual and impotent - the setting is in Africa  but it could well be in any  developing country. Naipaul's prose mirrors  the physical and political landscape against which the action takes place -  bleak and depressing. What keeps you going is a fascination with its three  central characters (Roche, Jane and Jimmy) and a dark sense of foreboding  that culminates in the  gruesome outcome. They are all unsympathetic  characters - self-serving and cruel. Jane is especially loathsome which,  without giving the ending away, lends a sort of poetic justice to the  conclusion of the whole affair - but where Naipaul ultimately fails is in  the less than convincingly drawn portrait of Jimmy (arguably the novel's  pivotal character) and hence in not preparing us sufficiently for the  display of violence and cruelty he manifested. I found gaps in my  understanding of Jimmy. I would like to revisit the novel some time. With a  little help from a fellow reader perhaps, I will someday get to the bottom  of this tale of hopelessness and despair.	1999-09-05
US	52572105	R21Q97JHQS8QKX	0140074481	706208703	Life and Times of Michael K: A Novel (King Penguin)	Books	5	47	51	N	N	An uplifting tale of spiritual courage	Michael K is by most people's reckoning a subnormally endowed specimen of a human being - physically and mentally handicapped, he appears to be no more than one of life's cruel failures. It is only his indomitable spirit  and courage which has helped him endure constant hardship and ultimately  transcend human suffering brought upon by South Africa's apartheid regime.  At one level, the story seems to be about the victory of spiritual and  morale courage over man's cruelty. Just as Michael's natural  otherworldliness served as a protective cloak against life's slings and  arrows, Coetzee seems to be telling us to take heart and emulate Michael -  if such a sorry human specimen can prevail against all odds, so can we. At  another level, the story seems to me to be about the independence or  autonomy of the human spirit from the realities of social and political  life. Through the eyes of soldiers and other conscious members of society,  we see a crumbling social order and chaos everywhere. Everything touched by  them is, as it were, defiled and rendered foul. Only in  Michael's  makebelieve world does he still find his private space and food still fit  for human consumption. Coetzee's slim novel makes for compelling reading.  His message is simple but powerful and uplifting.	1999-08-29
US	52572105	R3NYJUOMYZKL0U	0525484221	115400111	The Color of Blood	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A cracker  paced political thriller	I was lucky to have found this out-of-print Booker Prize nominated title in a second hand bookshop. I was attracted to its setting in an unidentified Eastern bloc country and its tale of political intrigue  involving the Church and the State. It also has at its centre the  fascinating character of Cardinal Bem whose faith is fully tested as he  battles dark forces threatening to unleash chaos on his tension fraught  country. The plot moves at a frenetic pace which leaves you breathless. I  found myself in the midst of an attempted assasination within the first  pages of the novel and propelled into a plot which twists and turns and  doesn't let go until the last shocking word is spilled. The ending had a  sense of inevitability about it - you could smell it coming. I finished the  book in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down. Moore's cracker paced  thriller makes an excellent read. I can't recommend it highly enough.	1999-08-28

I plumbed for the latter - the quaintly offbeat storyline was curiously enticing, promising both &quot;funfull&quot; reading and a sense of the ridiculous - black comedy in short. I wasn't disappointed. The novel is populated by largely unsympathetic characters but Bainbridge's empathy for their sense of desperation and need to find some form of escape from their drudgery makes them funny, touching and ultimately very human. I found her prose accessible, uncomplicated and highly enjoyable. The blurb at the back of the book promised more. But the ending is simply delicious..and hilarious.	1999-08-22
