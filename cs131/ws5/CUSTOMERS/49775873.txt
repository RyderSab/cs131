If you have ever been a parent that had to read to their children the same book about a million times in a row only to have the little darlings ask for it again, then this book is for you.  \\"Where's my cow?\\" is the perfect companion to \\"Thud\\".  Adults will enjoy the book because it is slightly subversive and if you have read \\"Thud\\" then you will want to scream with laughter because you are in on the joke.  Small children will love it because like every good children's book, it is full of color and great sounds to make.  The little darlings will want you to read this book to them the next million time in a row.  Could be worse ways to spend quality time with you kids.  Highly Recommended.	2005-10-13

This is a Sam Vimes book and like all of his Sam vimes books, \\"Thud\\" is more dark than light.  Pratchett explores deeper meanings in these book than most of the rest of the series.  Sam Vimes is the heart and soul of the Discworld.  This time Pratchett explores the mideast conflict.  Two groups of ancient enemies are building up hostilities in the city of Ankh Moorpork over some ancient symbols.  The dwarves and troll do not need much antagonism to set them fighting each other.  A Dwarf radical is killed and the trolls are blamed, so the tension builds.  Enter Sam Vimes to solve the case, except nothing is as it appears on the surface. <br /> <br />Once again Pratchett has written a masterpiece.  His character sketches are getting better and better.  I have been reading this series for better than twenty years and I am still amazed how fresh this world feels.  Pratchett fill out Vimes more so now his home world is now starting to but into his working life.  \\"Some thing are important\\" is the catch phrase throughout and I won't tell you now because it will ruin the story.  Pratchett explores the concept of radical religion and how it affects even the non-religious.  He never blames either side, but explores how both sides are right and wrong.  The ending is superb as usual, but it is rather sad... to a point.   <br /> <br />The usual cast of characters are here and they are delightful as ever.  Highly recommended	2005-10-13

This time a young man has promised his love to fetch a star that has fallen into the land of the faerie to win her heart. Young Tristan marches into the land of the faerie.  What he does not know is that there are others looking for the same star for their own reasons.  One is two brothers fighting for the right to rule their kingdom and the other is a witch that needs to have the star for everlasting youth.<br /><br />Once again Neil Gaiman has mixed both \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Grimms Fairy Tales\\" wonderfully.  He reminds me of Terry Pratchet for bringing vivid characters to life even if they are only in the story for a cameo.  The characters are both very light and very dark.  The bad guys are very bad and the good guys are characters.  Just reading the story will let you know that it will be alright in the end, even if the ending is not what you expected.  This book is both fun and light reading.  It is good for both adults and \\"tweeners\\" and is truly a good read.  Highly Recommended.	2005-08-30

This is the story of one WWWI soldier with a devastating injury that has basically left him a living slab of meat.  The soldier is unable to hear move or communicate with the outside world.  This is his story of how he lives within his mind.  The reader is given both the realities of war injuries as well as the author's point of view on war.  Understand that Dalton Trumbo is very anti-war and makes no bones about this.  If you are pro-war-on-terror and cannot stand the other point of view, do not read this book because it will only infuriate you.  However, if you are either anti-war or pro-war that can discuss rationally the other side views, then of course read this book.  Trumbo has humanized the realities of war through this soldier.  No matter what your politics are, there are realities that must be faced and he does with medical aloofness.  Trumbo puts you into the mind of this soldier as he tries to cope with his situation.  There are flashbacks to his earlier life as well as dealing with an itch that he cannot scratch. <br /> <br />This book is both hard to read and should not be missed.  It is a true classic and has relevancy 60 years after it was written.  Regardless or your politics, \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" shows what happens to the injured after the injury and it is not pretty and that is the point of this book.  Extremely Highly Recommended.	2005-08-30

That is the only warning you will get for this book.  If you are a fan of Bears for his sci-fi, then be warned.  If you are new to him then you will like this book.  Greg Bear has written a ghost story and a pretty good one at that.  It is not a horror, but more of a traditional story along the lines of the \\"Haunting of Hill House\\".  Not much on the blood and guts department, but the idea of how the ghosts arrive is fun and gives you something to think about. <br /> <br />\\"Dead Lines\\" is based in Hollywood and Bear provides a glimpse into what happens to the B-listers.  His character is Peter Russell; was once a sex ploitation director in lines of Russ Meyer who is down on his luck.  He works for an old producer and his wife running errands.  He is divorced from his wife and has a living twin daughter and a murdered one.  Russell is given an oppurtunity to earn a great deal of money with a new type of cell phone.  That's when his problems start. <br /> <br />Dead lines is run to read and well written.  It is not as tight as his better known science fiction, but that could be because he has jumped genres and now has to learn to rewrite for the new genre.  His character development could also be tightened up.  This book is certainly better than his \\"Vitals\\" but not as good as \\"Songs of Earth and Power\\" his fantasy epic.  This is a great summer read and is very fast, if a bit shallow.  Good way to pass the time.	2005-08-19

At the beggining of this book, the editors explain their parameters of why they chose what they did.  The editors only chose science fiction and nothing else such as horror laced or speculative fiction.  The problem is that this last year for the anthology was from a shallow pool of available material.  Science fiction is in a bit of a lull.  This does not mean \\"Year's best SF 10\\" is bad.  It is not, most of the book is very good.  Some of the stories that do not work are just unremarkeable and one or two of them, I wonder what the editors were thinking.  My two personal favorite stories are \\"Wealth\\" by Reed and \\"Time As it Evaporates\\" by Dunyack.  Both of these stories are excellent are are worth the price of the book alone.  \\"Strood\\" is also fun to read and should not be missed.  I enjoy this particular series every year and this year is no exception.  As you will find with any series, some years are better than others and once again this is the case again.  The book is worth the purchase, but not as good as other years such as year's 1, 4, 5, and 9.	2005-07-27

This one is about a young lady, Coraline, who has moved to a new house in London with her mother and father.  You find out the young lady is bored because both of her parents are too busy to play with her. Coraline finds a door that has been bricked up and she is told that it leads to nowhere.  Except that the door leads to an alter world that looks just like her own except something is not quite right.  The house looks the same and the people that live in the house are caricatures of the her true house.  There is also a secret Coraline has to figure out. <br /> <br />Gaiman has written a childrens book in the style of both \\"Narnia\\" and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".  The \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" theme has also shown in his book \\"Neverwhere\\" and has some of the same flavor as this book.  The difference is that \\"Coraline \\" has been written for children.  It is a very good book for the kids and it is quite enjoyable for adults.  The story line and character dvelopment is not quite on the level of adult books, but the sketchiness also leaves open to broader interpretation for the reader.  The book is both simple on the surface and yet full of deaper meanings.  Coraline is a hero seen through the eyes of a child.  That is how this book should be judged. Throught the eyes of a child on its own merits.  Coraline is both scary and yet it is also fun.  Give this good book to a child if you want them to enjoy what they will read.  Highly Recommended.	2005-07-18

Hersey tells the story of Hiroshima and the aftermath of what happens.  Instead of telling the entire story minute-by-minute, Hersey focuses on six people living very different lives on the day of the atomic bomb blast.  He puts a human face to the story of the devastation of a civilian city. <br /> <br />Hersey's brilliance is not that the book is well written, it is, the brilliance is that he focuses on the six people and tells about what every surviving japanese citizen endured after the blast.  Hersey never gives detailed accounts, but hints at the terrible pain and injuries each person recieved, which makes the entire episode more horrifying.  Hersey also spends a great deal of time explaining the ambivilance of the Hiroshima citizens toward the idea of the bomb.  Many of course were angry, but many more had a \\"it can't be helped\\" attitude.  Hersey explains that Hiroshima was both and economic and transportation crossroads.   He also explains that the Japanese government followed a \\"total war\\" philosophy and this was the price.  Hersey does not condone nor criticize the dropping of the bomb. <br /> <br />This is an execellent book and should be read by everybody.  The end of the book is updated during the eighties to tell the final outcome of the six people.  Each has a story that both resembles each other and yet are very different in each of their own way.  For me the most surreal moment of the book was when one of the six end up on \\"This is Your Life\\" and meets the pilot of the Enola Gay.  Excellent read.  Highley Recommended.	2005-07-14

The first part is Frankel's experiences in various concentration camps during WWII.  The anecdotes are deeply disturbing while it gives an insight how someone can survive the horrors of the times.  It is these experiences that the second part of the book relies upon. <br /> <br />The second part of the book is what Frankel describes as logotherapy.  Frankel's hypothesis and his psychotherepic practice after the war is based on the premis that man's life needs to have meaning.  He uses the story of various prisoners trying to survive another day including not smoking the last bit of a cigarette because that was the reason to continue until the next day.  He notes that everybody in the camp would know when a prisoner was going to die because they gave up the will to live.   <br /> <br />This is not an easy read and it is not an indepth study of logotherapy.  What it is is a very concisly written book on both the horrors of prison camp and the development of a fascinating therapy developed from part of these experiences.  It is interesting to note that he turned a horror into a benefit to mankind.  For that development, this is alone worth reading. Highly Recommended	2005-01-15

If that is true then Vonnegut is a true master.  \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is a true masterpiece.  The short stroies are a study of our society.  The story that is the name of the book shows how a society can go wrong with the idea of doing good.  The hero is a rapist who lives in a society that actually encourages suicide.  The women who work at these suicide centers have sex with their clients before they die, but the women cannot feel anything below their waist so they cannot enjoy sex due to \\"medicine\\" they take.  The \\"hero\\" lets the drug wear off then rapes the women so they can feel for the first time sexual pleasure.  The study is the rapes of women by one man as compared to the societal rape by making women not be able to feel pleasure. Tough stuff.  The story ends with the explanation of how the idea of anesthetizing the pleasurable feel of sex started, which is the name of the story.  <br /> <br />Harrison Bergeron is every bit as scary because it is what happens when the law makes everybody equal.  There is always someone that has to run the show and they can't be equal.  \\"All of the Kings Men\\" is about a game of chess where captured soldiers are the actual pieces and their leader has to make tough choices. <br /> <br />Not all of the stories are so depressing.  \\"Who will I be Tommorrow\\" is about a couple who fall in love by never being themselves.  It is fun and light although it does explore the deeper meaning of relationships. <br /> <br />\\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" is a masterpiece and should not be missed.  It is a thinking man's book, but at the same time so well written that is it is truly enjoyable as it is on it's own.  Highly reccommended.	2005-01-06

It couldn't happen here!  Wanna bet?  That is the backdrop to \\"The Wave\\".  Hip history teacher Burt Ross decides to answer his students with an experiment.  Instead of Nazism, he calls it \\"The Wave\\" and couches the terminology in good feeling ideas that grab some of the kids.  He then stands back and watches.<br /><br />The idea catches on with some of the students.  The class loser suddenly starts to gain status and moves up in the social order.  Some of the students start to recruit and the \\"movement\\" builds.  Just as Nazism did, the movement starts to use intimidation and veiled threats to gain new members.  The situation starts to fly out of control with burt Ross trying to figure how to regain control.<br /><br />This story is the metaphor for the rise and fall of Nazism.  It is also based on a true story out of California.  That is what makes it so scary.  That it could happen in America.  Even in the land of the free, a cult of personality can lead to the very thing our society hates.  The right to dissent is the hinge pin to our freedoms even if the people dissenting seem to be nuts.  The story shows perfectly how trying to do something good can lead to the very thing the group is trying to avoid.  Mass movements are not always good and society is fine just the way it is even if it is not perfect.  Think about that the next time you hear about the next great thing to fix us.

I have marked down four stars when I really give it 4 1/2.  This is wonderfull to read.  Simmons also writes an anecdote to each story about the story or his connection to writing the story.  In his anecdotes, you find that he loves where he lives and loves the annual neighborhood get togethers.  He also loves writing, but not necessarily the business of writing.  Taken together, they add a nice depth to his writing and gives you a greater appreciation to his stories.  There are five here and not one of them is a dud.  He returns to Hyperion in one of the stories and the reader would enjoy the story more if they had read the series, but the story still stands on its own legs.  He also writes about mountain climbing with aliens and the brotherhood that develops with such an activity whether you are human or not.  The \\"End of Gravity\\" is about an American writer going to Russia to look at their space accompishments.  The \\"Ninth of Av\\" is about Jewish decendents going through another dark period of history. <br /> <br />If you are new to Dan Simmons, then this is a good book to start with becasue you get a wide variety of his style and abilities.

This book reminds me of a sciencetific version of \\"Raiders of the Lost Arc\\".  There is a good guy and an Evil scientist and all of the assorted paraphernalia that is associated with a saturday morning serial.  The Hero, Hal Cousins, is researching an eternal life project when things go very wrong for him.  His twin brother is killed and he is pulled ever deeper into a twisting story.  The rest of the story reads like a mystery with the hero trying to unravel the truth. <br /> <br />The problem with this book is that it misses.  I know that this is an unsatisfactory answer.  There is nothing overtly wrong with the story except that it feels both half-finished and already done better by somebody else.  This is not really badly written, but not up to Bear's usual standards.  This book reminds me of his earliest works when he was still finding his voice and style.  The book is probally two drafts from being very good, but Bear stopped for his reasons.  This book is not bad, but not great either.	2004-12-14

He is also the first to open a dojo (karate school) in Tokyo.  Whether he is actually the father of modern Karate or not is not relevant because he is truly a recognized Grand-Master.  This is his story of both his life, karate, and the philosophies the martial artist follows.  He also explodes some of the more famous myths that seem to surround karate and other martial arts such as ripping a man's heart out with your bare hands. <br /> <br />Funakoshi writes about his masters and the differences between karate then and now.  He writes about the change of his culture during the late nineteenth century and the resistance with the Samarai families.  He explains the dedication and hardships he endured to open Shotokan (the first karate school).  He does not weave a tale of woe.  He actually understates the case and leaves it to the reader to grasp the obvious.  It is this understating that is the true beauty of this book.  He writes about having to hurt a would be attacker and then feeling that he failed in his quest of martial arts.  Funakoshi states time and again the artist does not use his art to harm and he feels that it is true failure to lower oneself to the use of violence.  His anecdotes is how a true master is able to avoid physical conflict. <br /> <br />This book is a great read for both the martial artist and non-artist.  I am a student of karate, but not Shotokan and this book is incredibly important to me.  This is not a how to, but the story of the develpoment of a grand-master.  Highly Recommended.	2004-12-14
US	49775873	RQPVPOUOCS2G8	0763617261	349876476	Feed	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Wonderfull	M.T. Anderson should be considered the next Vonnegut.  Using biting satire, Anderson exposes a dark underneath of society.  Anderson takes the idea of the internet that has been hardwired to the brain with all of the pop up ads to buy buy buy and the removal of the natural thinking of young adults.  The book is told from the point of Titus, a teenager.  The book is written as teens talk.  This can be aggravating to older readers, but it is still quite effective toward younger readers who are the target audience.  Titus believes his world of buying and constant fashion change is how the whole world is living.  The book mentions other troubles throughout, such as body lesions that everybody is developing and riots in other parts of the country, but they are either ignored or turned into a fashion statement themselves.  The story turns on the fact Titus meets, Violet, a young lady that has her feed malfunction and he has to deal with the fallout of the feed failure.  He is unprepared to deal with the real life situation and worse, Violet is the consience of the book.  She points out there are troubles on the planet and everybody is ignoring them.  Titus has troubles dealing with Violet and his parents react by buying him a new car instead of helping him deal with the troubles, reminds me of most of my friends parents growing up hmmm...  <br /> <br />M.T. Anderson is brilliant with this book because it works on two parts.  First: it is a story about the relationship of a young man and the girl from the wrong side of the tracks and the social interaction between them.  Second: the world is not doing well and the rest of the beautiful people ignore the obvious, not because they don't care, but because they have been conditioned not to know any better.  Titus reminds me of the main character from 'THX1138', a drone in a society that stamps out individuality.  He starts to realize that something is wrong, but can't quite figure out what it is.  It is this second part that is so important.  The Earth in trouble has been given the backburner, but it is really the main issue for the book.  Anderson has pulled off quite a feat here.  The feed and the Earth's collapse is what the reader will eventually remember, not the characters.  This book is important!  Highly Recommended.	2004-10-13

He has returned to his famous world on the back of a giant turtle and delivered another gem.  This time a hanged con man has been given a job by the Patricion to run the defunct post office.  Moist von Lipwig decides to cut out only to find that he has a golem as both his personal body gaurd and parole officer, so he has to stay and perform his duty.  To me, the explanation of why a golem is the perfect parole officer is one of the high points of the book.  Pratchett once again manages to make an incredibly complex book easy and fun to read.  He manages to have a main character that the story revolves around, but it is the supporting cast that is the true focus with their true life idiosyncracies.  Once again the Patrician's character is filled in a bit more, but he is still a work in progress.  A tyrant that truly cares for the well being of it's citizens.  Go Figure.     <br /> <br />Pratchett's discworld is also becoming more subtle and complex.  He has managed to write in this world for more than twenty years and it is still fresh.  He adds new characters so he can use them later in following books.  Many of his characters from previous books make appearences and it is fun for those of us that have been long time readers to recognize these characters.  It is not important if you have not read him before, this book stands nicely on its own.  It is just like an inside joke that you would miss, but without knowing it.  This book is both fun and a delight to read.  Highly recommended.	2004-10-07

This is the final book in the Dark Tower Series and is supposedly the final King novel.  \\"The Dark Tower\\" picks up right where \\"Song of Susannah\\" left off, with Jake and Father Callahan trying to save Susannah from the low men who are forcing her have the baby known as the 'chap'.  The path to the tower is full of pain and tears.  This is not an easy read nor is it magical either.  The entire book is dark and there is a sense of foreboding throughout till the end.  King is masterful again, but what he does to the various characters is painful to those of us who have followed the tale for twenty years.  then ending was a surprise to me and left me dissatisfied until when I thought about it later, then it occured to me that it is the perfect ending and the only one that made sense.  He also has weaved \\"It\\" and \\"Insomnia\\" into this final book quite effectively.  You need to read carefully becasue there is much to miss of why \\"Insomnia\\" is important.  Certain characters have made returns from other books as well as an important character that is new to this book.   <br /> <br />\\"The Dark Tower\\" is the Arthurian legend of the Holy Grail retold as a western.  It also reminds me of his story \\"The Long Walk\\" he wrote as Richard Bachman. A long hard walk on a road with people dying along the way, but having their story told.  This is not his best work, but it is still execellent and it is not by far a bad way to retire.  You should read his other works to get the full depth of his series.  Without his other stories, some of the textual material will be missed and that would be a disservice to you.  Highly Recommended.	2004-10-01

This is a book of nine shortstories that are linked to a future society as a common thread.  Some of the various characters show up in more than one story, but not as the main character in more than one.  Mosley paints a bleak picture of the future as a revolving cycle of employment/ unemployment.  Nobody ownes anything anymore, it is all leased from a corporation.  Shirking your work is now a punishable crime and the constitution no longer applies to individuals. <br /> <br />Futureland can be classified in two ways, 1: it reminds the reader of cyberpunk novels, but without all of the cool gadgets and anti heros beating the system. 2: it is written in the same vein that \\"Brave New World\\" explores.  Mosley focuses in one the lives of various people in the short story and explains the world through their eyes.  It is not very pretty and the book does not end in a pretty way.  This is very well written and is enjoyable.  Recommended.	2004-09-17

The book is set in the near future with the Earth recieving a call from outer space 'they' are coming.  The reader finds the Earth falling apart from overcrowding and the usual political wars, but not the usual players.  The story jumps between various characters with higher or lower interest in the coming.   <br /> <br />To me, this book feels like a seventies movie about post apolyptic earth without all of the destruction yet.  It is on the brink.   Think of a combination of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'Soylent Green' and you have the feel of this book.  It is not a bad book by any means.  It is rather enjoyable and a nice easy read.  It misses because the reader doesn't have to think about the Earth's situation.  Some of his characters also miss.  Haldeman places a medical student in the book who also has to perform in porn videos to pay for school. She adds nothing to the story except that the world is not right.  He also has the proverbial crazy lady who's character is left hanging in the story.  If either one was not added, the story would not have suffered at all.  Nice easy read that is enjoyable, but nothing special here.	2004-09-11

Hyams has written an important book.  \\"Zen in the Martial Arts\\" is not really about martial arts, nor is it about Zen either.  Using martial arts and his personal experiences, Hyams tries to explain the martial artists mind.  There is a state where the artist stops thinking and just does.  This is the point of this book.  Hyams explains that most of the lessons are not taught but learned from the student at their pace when they are ready.  Hyams also explains that the best teachers learn from their students as well as teach. <br /> <br />For me, the most interesting note in this book was that Bruce Lee was not perfect, but had his own personal limitations and he worked within them.  This was a big point within the book.  This is a very good book and is a great place to start the mental portion of training.  Highly recommended.	2004-08-24

Two families, the Barbarossa and the Geary are at each others throats for generations.  They share a dark secret that has threatened to tear each apart.  The story is about when one of the wives of a Geary learns about the favorite son of the Barbarossa's, Galillee.  Rachael meets Galillee and the motions of the trouble between the two familles start once again, which lead to a final confrotation between them. <br /> <br />Clive Barker has written an incredibly conplex work, but it is still accessable.  All of the characters are flawed, which make them all the more believable.  The story reminds you of Hamlet from the point of the two warring families and forbidden love.  This story is a must read and is highly recommended	2004-08-16

At the end of the last book Talon killed the leader of the group that slaughtered his family.  In this book he is going after the leader who ordered the killing.  To do this, he must swear an oath of feality to the very man he swears to kill.  Talon finds out he is now on his own in this portion of the quest because the Shadow of Conclaves will be unable to help for fear of their plan being discovered by the ancient enemy.  Talon now goes into service of the Duke of Olasko.  The duke betrays Talon, which releases Talon from his oath and he raises an army to kill Olasko. <br /> <br />Feist once again writes with flushed out characters.  The reader sees some characters from the first novel as well as some from previous books.  Once again the story is not new, but it is still enjoyable.  If you are a Feist fan, then you should enjoy this book.  If you are new to Feist, then read \\"Talon of the Silver Hawk\\" first to understand this book.  Fast and enjoyable, but nothing new.

The book picks up about twenty years after the end of the forever war.  The soldiers are now chafing at the bit from the treatment at the hands of the clones from Earth.  They are tired of being kept on their planet of middle finger as insurance against genetic failure of the perfect clones.  A group led by the hero of the first book, Mandella, steal a space ship and travel into the far galaxy to find their fortune.  What happens is unexpected and the group returns to Earth to find the truth.   <br /> <br />This takes a different turn from the \\"Forever War\\" in its scope.  This book questions religion and not the meaning of war.  The ending is a bit contrived for me, but the book was enjoyable non the less.  A nice bit of lite reading.  If you are a bit strict in your interpretation of religion, be warned you might not find the subject matter that easy.  Recommended	2004-08-08
US	49775873	RWNWH9X7U7LJ5	0441005667	204362253	Forever Peace	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Well Done	Forever Peace is well done.  It is not the continuation of Forever War, but it can be seen as a side bar to the bigger war.  The story is a study of society between the first world and third world.  As in the real world, the first world has access to the niceties and the third world doesn't and there is a struggle between the two.  The first world has machines called soldier boys that are remotely controlled by remotely plugged in soldiers.  The soldiers are connected to each other so it is like living in each others head.  This leads to unanticipated problems between the soldiers and their loved ones.  There are also other unanticipated problems such as the various plugged in soldiers are having nervous breakdowns and the braintrust cannot figure it out. <br /> <br />Haldeman does a great job examining the problems of  <br />America with having too much and the third world not having enough.  He is also brilliant in his study of what can happen to soldiers waging war when they are actually disconnected from the actual combat and he also gives ideas of what problems may arise as the technology advances to the point of where no soldiers need to be in harms way.  This is a very involved story and character driven with it not as much about war as it is about humanity.  Forever Peace won the Hugo and Nebula awards, so it is obvious a great read.

It is the story about Philip who wanted to be on the track team but was unable because of poor grades. The young man is considered nice, but a bit of a clown.  His English teacher, Miss Narwin, gave him a low grade which kept him off the team and it is his intention of getting out of her class that is the backdrop for the story.  Philip begins to hum the Star Spangled Banner during homeroom that lands him in trouble.  Philips clownish behavior escalates into a national debate on the Star Spangled Banner and whether it is ok for students to show patriotism. <br /> <br />Avi has done a remarkable job of showing both sides of this conflict.  What started out as small matter escalates into a very large problem because of half information and ham fisted handling of the situation by everyone involved.  Philip truly believes that his teacher is out to get him and he takes steps to go to another English teacher.  Miss Narwin is being a good teacher, but she suffers from burnout and other frustrations and maybe overreacted to Philip.  When Philip's mother tries to intervene, she is brushed off by the principal who believes this is just a behavioral problem and overreacts with the no tolerance policy.  The press gets involved and the matter quickly erupts.  Nothing but the truth is a great way to show how a minor matter can be misinterpreted and overreacted.  keep this in mind when you hear about some school reaction to a seemingly stupid situation.  Highly recommended.	2004-08-02

Seven people are on their way as pilgrims to the time tombs to meet a monster called the Shrike.  Each pilgrim tells their story of why they are going to meet the Shrike and what they want. Some see the Shrike as a monster and others as a god.    <br />Dans Simmons has created a richly textured world that is very detailed and believable.  The characters are neither good nor bad, just various areas of gray.  The book is very deep and is worth the effort to read.  The book is very readable but will take some time becasue it is not a super fast read.  This is the first of four series and the others should also be read.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-17

The story never drags and the reader is pulled into the story.  The main character, Shadow, is released from prison only to find out his wife was killed in a car accident just before his release and not only that she was killed with her lover who was Shadow's close friend.  After his release, Shadow meets Mr. Wednesday who is actually the old God Odin.  As the story progresses, the reader is informed that the old gods such as Odin and other gods from the various panthoen of religions are going to war with the new gods in America such as Media and Internet.  Shadow is caught between the warring factions.  The rest of the story is the gods planning the war and Shadow trying to figure out what is really happening to the gods.<br />This is a hard book to put down.  The character development is well defined and the plot never drags even though it is a rather lengthy book.  &quot;American Gods&quot; is full of twists and turns and the ending is not what I was expecting which is a joy.

A reluctant soldier comes home from a never ending war without winning to a changed world he no longer recognizes.  For this alone, this book is worth reading.  However, the story stands on its own feet and he does a remarkable job.  This book is part &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and part &quot;Armor&quot;.  The reader actually feels for the soldiers who survive an unsurvivorable war only to find their world they left has changed and not for the better in their eyes.  Much of the change has to do with worm holes and time dialation.  Haldeman does a good job explaining the concept without getting to lost in the science which is not needed here.  The enemy is not expanded upon and left shadowy except to explain that they are tough fighters and their tactics make no sense.  This helps heighten the frustration of the soldiers and is a nice touch.  The end of the story is rather abrupt, although ingenious and it certainly left itself open to a sequel.

He covers his life in Suburban Detroit with his family and his future co-workers in the Evil Dead.  What comes across is a man that both loves his craft as well as understands his position in the &quot;B&quot; list position of Hollywood.  Campbell Spends a great deal of time writing about his experiences from both the Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2.  The movie is fun to watch, but it certainly not fun to make.  Campbell gives an inside look at the whole process and how unglamorous it actually is.  Campbell also writes how tough the acting life is on families.  He writes about his divorce and why she left him.  He also writes about how there are long periods of time between the work and dealing with this.  He does not name names as some books do on the dirt, but he does mention some of his personal peeves of some actors and if you know the movies he writes about, you can figure out the actor.  Mostly this book is alot of fun, full of pictures, and it is truly a nice way of passing time.  Highly Recommended	2004-07-03

The play was freely adapted from the &quot;Scopes Monkey Trial&quot; of 1925.  The teacher was placed on trial for teaching evolution and not creationism.  This argument continues to rage today after the turn of the twenty first century!  The beauty of this play is that it is simplicity itself.  The play is a very fast read and is very enjoyable.  The play covers some very tough subjects, but does it in such a way that the reader deos not get bogged down in heavy philosophical discussions.  They are still there, but handled in an ingenious way.  What I loved about this play was that the issues were not really about the teacher, but the clash of personalities of the major players.  The teacher is nothing more than a background player here and the evangelist and the defense lawyer are the true stars.  Makes one think when the same issue comes up after eighty years since the original trial of Scopes what is really being argued.  Highly recommended	2004-06-30

As compared with everybody else is is still the best collection out there. as compared against his own work, is still good but not a classic.  This may not be fair to him, but &quot;Quicker Than the Eye&quot; just does not rise up to his historic standards.  This collection seems to about death in its various forms, but told through the eye of a romantic.  Some of the stories are about true horror &quot;The Finnegan&quot; and some of the stories are about time travel &quot;The Witch Door&quot;.  My personal favorites are &quot;If MGM is Killed, Who Gets the Lion?&quot; and &quot;Free Dirt&quot;.  The first leaves a smile on your face and the second is a macabre tale about getting free dirt from a graveyard.  This is still good stuff and is a very enjoyable way to pass the time, just not up to the legendary standards of the past.  Recommended.	2004-06-30

An old Hollywood star shows up at the narrator's doorstep with a book claiming that it is a book of the dead and that every name on the list is eaither dead will be very shortly.  Then the Hollywood star disappears into the storm.  The narrarator enlists the help of an unwilling friend to find Constance and track down the names in the book. <br />This book is typical Bradbury with the metaphor and is fun to read.  He just keeps getting better and better with time.  Once again there is more to the eye than is apparent here.  Bradbury takes the reader through the Hollywood he remembers with the stars of yesteryear and their over the top lifestyles, but he also shows that it is not all glamour and things do fade with time.  Once again as with other of his later works, &quot;Graveyard for Lunatics&quot; the narrator is unnamed (you can guess who it is) and is told in a breathless first person.  This is a homage to the 1940's film noir mysteries and is great fun.  Highly recommended.	2004-06-30

This book examines the develpoment of society from hunter gatherer to working together and the rise of writing.  The rats are borrowed from \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\".

This is one of the questions that Jon Krakauer tries to answer.  At first the reader is given the idea that Chris McCandless read one too many books like &quot;On the Road&quot; or &quot;White Fang&quot;, but as the story develops, he becomes more complex a character.  This young man was looking for adventure and decided to leave &quot;normal&quot; life behind.  Unfortanuatly for him. it cost him his life.<br />Krakauer does an amazing job of bringing McCandless back to life by trying to show what he was thinking.  Krakauer used personal notes, interviews with family and friends and historical experiences to flesh out this person.  When the personal notes run out and speculation starts, Krakauer gives a personal tale to explain why McCandless was not an idiot and just had some bad luck.

I read it in two long sittings and it is excellent.  He is finally winding down his masterpiece.  You have to read the previous books to understand the story line in this book.  You should also read most of his other books to get a richer understanding of the depth of his quest, but it not necessary.  As a long time fan, it is nice to see metion of other works that are weaved into this epic which closes out some questions that have been left hanging on his other works.  All of his other works has been tied to the Dark Tower.<br />The story picks up where &quot;The Wolves of the Calla&quot; left off at the end of the last battle between the gunslingers and the wolves.  Sussanah has disappeared through the portal with her &quot;other&quot; self Mia.  The rest of the gunslingers split into two groups, one to chase Susannah and the other to find other answers.  This portion of the story is basically split between Sussanah/Mia and Eddie/Roland.  Jake is mentioned, but not much time is spent on him in this story.  Many questions are answered or at least explained of what is going on at this point. Mia is explained and you get a feeling why the children are important to the &quot;Dark Tower&quot;.  Some loose ends from the &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; are tied up and finished as well as &quot;'Salems Lot&quot; becoming more important to the overall story.  <br />For me, the most interesting part of the story is that King has become a character in his own book as himself.  He is pivitol to the story, but this will not become apparent until the next book.  King explains how he writes and how he started the &quot;Dark Tower&quot;.  Whether this portion is fiction or not doesn't matter, it is still incredible. Once you pick up the book, you won't be able to put it down, so have a long free period to read.

The main character Kira, is born lame and should not have survived until the start of this story, but she has a talent as a seamstress and village elders have need of her skills.  Much like \\"The Giver\\", this book focuses on a study of society and trying to come to an answer.  Because this book is aimed at young adults, most of the baser behaviors are only hinted at, which actually make them more horrible because it has been left to the imagination.  Much like all good reads, the giver leaves one with more questions than answers.  \\"Gathering Blue\\" is an enjoyable read for both early teens as well as adults.  It is a good start for young adults to start to read and question the role of society for them and in general the larger population.	2004-06-07

Using everything from famous speeches to modern day slam poetry, &quot;Why Freedom Matters&quot; explains how important the concept of freedom is.  The book is broken into five major sections with the various writings set into the theme of each section.  The writings reflect different parts of american history from both an American perspective as well as a foreign perspective.  D.H. Lawrence wrote a poem about censors that both makes you laugh and shiver at the same time.  One of my personal favorites in this book is the letter from Kurt Vonnegut to a chairman of a school board for burning his book.  It is his reaction that still gives me hope for our future as a country.  This book also contains many women from the annuals of history who are mostly forgotten.  This book accomplishes what many school texts do not, giving an appreciation for history without booring the subject to death.  There is something here for everybody.  This is one that should be added to the personal libraries of every household.	2004-06-03

The authors give nice advice about surviving the work load as well as the pitfalls of law school personalities.

This book saved my law school carreer.  law school tests are notoriously ambigous.  There are no right answers.  Unfortunatly, there seems to be no help for students.  One of the proscribed methods is the IRAC method (when you get to school you will learn this and this is not the time to write about it).  This book gives you a different way of acheving success in the test.  The book does criticize IRAC and offers its own way of handling the testing questions.  &quot;Getting To Maybe&quot; is written by law professors and who would know more about passing their tests as well as how a professor thinks?  The book is a well written philosophy on the test and the mistakes.  The authors spend a great deal of time explaining their philosophy and it is helpfull for the second half of the book.  The book shows the common test question mistakes and how to fix them.  The book also provides sample tests with sample answers and explanations of why they are good answers.  This is the best part of the book, a side by side comparison of good and bad answers which makes this book invaluable.  Highly reccommended.	2004-05-20

It was about a small city called Sanctuary and the goings on within this city.  A caste of characters was developed by different authors and as the books progressed, so did the characters.  The difference was the authors could use characters from each other.  This gave a very rich narrarative to the various tales.  Instead of getting one version of events, the reader recieved many versions of the same accounts.  This gave the world of Thieves World a depth not very often seen.<br />Lynn Abbey has returned to the city again and worked his magic.  Once again the city of Sanctuary is in full bloom.  This is the first of the new set and it is a great beggining.  The setting is many years after the end of the last book from the last collection. This gives the city a new feel, but does leave an old reader wondering what happened to the various characters from the last anthology.  Some old characters do make appearences as older  or dead versions of themselves, but most of them are gone without mention.  A new reader can figure out what had happened with the history from the new stories, but there is nothing like living the old books.  This is my only complaint about first book.  The writing is superb and Abbey gets my compliments with his editing and choice of writers.  My personal favorite story is &quot;Doing the Gods' Work&quot; by Jody Van Nye.  Even in a city of cutthroats, somebody is trying to build something for the good.<br />This book is great start to something new and does harken back to the old for those of us who enjoyed the first Anthology.

The reader can already see that Bear is great at developing both an intriguing story and well defined characters.  The problem with this book is that it leaves the reader feeling unfinished.  Compared to his later works &quot;Darwins Radio&quot; and &quot;Queen of Angels&quot;, this is unfinished work.  It is not bad, just not finished.  Much of the underlying society study that he has become so familiar for developing is missing, although there are hints of it in this book.  This is both enjoyable and an easy read.  It is also a great book to start with for Bear.  It is certainly not one of his best, but it does show his early start and that is not bad.	2004-01-20

This time it is about the commander of the watch going back in time trying to catch a killer and running into himself as a young copper.  Because he has gone back into time, Vimes has to set the past right again or risk damaging the future.  The reader gets to meet many of the beloved cast of characters that have emerged from the diskworld series over the last twenty years.  The reader meets everyone from Nobby to the Patrician as a young man.<br />The book is as funny as always although it does have that serious undertone that Pratchett has developed over the last couple of years.  He explains the reasons to be honest when everyone else is crooked and some of the bad guys get their comeuppance in the usual ways.  This is a great book for the Pratchett fanatic, but not for the new reader because there is too much to miss by not knowing the characters from the earlier books.  Read the older ones first and you will love the action in this new one.  Highly reccommended.	2004-01-20

A man who has spent his entire life working on an amusemnet pier fixing the rides, died trying to save a small child from an accident.  He wakes up in &quot;heaven&quot; and meets five people from his past.  The five of them explain why his life has not been a total loss as he assumed that it was.  The five people are all conected to him in some manner.  Some of the five were very important in his life and some never met him, but were still connected.  The main character Eddie meets everone in different settings that they consider &quot;Heaven&quot; and why they consider it &quot;Heaven&quot;.  The five of them explain various parts of his life and why things turned out like they did.  The end of the book wraps up nicely and is a bit of a surprise.<br />Mitch Albom has taken a very complex idea and explained his version of &quot;heaven&quot; in an easy to read style.  The book never drags and it leaves you with a good feeling.  Although it has religious connotations, it is not a book on relious beliefs.  Any version of &quot;heaven&quot; can be used in place instead. Albom never lectures on beliefs, but instead focuses on Eddie and trying to answer why his life turned out like it did.  Eddie represents everyone of us who ever thought about their life either not measuring up or being a failure.  By showing Eddie his life through others eyes, he actually shows that the unimportant life is very important to at least a few and more likely many that we never even knew we affected.  That is the true beauty of this book.  Highly reccommended.	2003-10-05

He has explained how at various times during the nations history leaders stepped up to the plate and &quot;did the right thing&quot;.  Most of these men did not like the enemy or cause they were protecting.  The President mentions frequently throughout his book how more often than not the man of courage was a bitter enemy of the man he was protecting.  This book is about the American ideal.  During times of crisis, somebody always comes through.  All of the men paid a dear price politically.  Most of them disappeared into the annuals of history and were not recognized until much later how imporant their contribution actually was to the United States.  Kennedy also points out these were normal ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances.  He also points out they were not all truly nice men.  Many of them were arrogant demi-gods, but at that moment they rose to the occasion.<br />President Kennedy's book is remarkable for the fact that it shows how amazing the United States actually is.  Where other countries have fallen apart because they could find their way through difficulties, the united States survived and flourished.  It may be pure luck on our part, but I think it is who we are.  We may not like each other much of the time, but during times of crisis we pull together as a nation.  The beauty of this book is that some of the stories have been told of the great men who showed such courage when it would have been easier to go with the crowd.  this book is a must read.	2003-09-04

A Winter Haunting is the sequel to Summer of Night.  The title seems to be a play on words with each other.  \\"Summer of Night\\" is about youngsters surviving a horror and \\"A Winter Haunting\\" is about dealing with the aftermath later in life.<br />The protagonist, Dale Stewart, returns to his childhood home to try and rebuild his life and renew his writing.  He has survived a failed marriage and a disasterous love affair that had left him taking medication for depression.  Stewart rents the home of a friend that had died during the first book.  Soon after his arrival, Stewart begins to have visitations from supernatural dogs, ghosts, and neo-Nazis.  Most of the book leaves the reader thinking he is finally going over the edge of sanity.  The narrarator's voice is the only proof the Dale is not crazy.  The story is told by the voice of his dead childhood friend.<br />What develops is an intense book about coming to terms with the past.  Simmons has explored similar phenomenon before in other books (Phases of Gravity & Hyperion).  The shattered Stewart confronts his past and remembers.  As all of Simmon's horror and sci-fi books, this is highly reccommended.	2003-09-02

The reader follows an appeal of a young man convicted in conspiracy during a robbery that had turned into murder.  Geoghegan sits as the second chair (the support attorney) during the appeal.   Geoghegan does a wonderful job of explaining that the convicts can actually be nice people and have remorse for their actions.  The convicted shooter actually tries to help the young man during appeal by testifying for him, although he has nothing to gain.  The reader learns that Geoghegan is surprised to find that the shooter is actually nice and well spoken.  The reader follows through the appeal process and learns the law is very different depending what type the lawyer practices.  Criminal is much different from civil in which Geoghegan practices.  <br />This book is split into two sections.  The first part is the appeal and the second part is Geoghegan's views of what is wrong with the justice system and the legal profession in general.  He provides a very liberal view on the death penalty, abortion, and against Republican views.  He makes no bones about where his leanings are and this is actually a fresh perspective.  He shows that attorneys are human with normal views of right and wrong.  He openly wonders about the shortcomings of the system and if anything can be done about this.  This book is an absolute must read and is very highly recomended.	2003-08-28

He has made the reader feel for the antagonists.  This book is written about the German side of WWI.  His main character, Paul Baumer, talks in the first person about his travails during the war.  He starts out as a high school graduate joining with some friends after graduation.  The story unfolds about his boot camp at the hands of a sadistic drill instructor who turns out to be the postman from their hometown who they used to tease.<br />The story progresses to the war and Pauls personal feelings of both comradery and fear.  Fof me, one of the most intense moments in the book is when the reader learns of another soldier who had soiled his pants in fear turns out to be injured later in the battle with Paul helping to tends to his wounds.  The book also does a wonderful job of showing how the veterans try and help the recruits survive.<br />This is a remarkable novel because of its realism.  Remarque drew upon his years in the army during WWI to write this book.  He writes a chilling account of the horrors of war by using the attacking side after the tide of war has turned against them.  What he does that is so incredible is to show the humanity of the German soldiers.  Many of them have no clue as to why they are actually fighting.  His descriptions of the battles must have given him nightmares for years after the war because they are so real.  I could smell the smoke and death as he wrote about them.  This novel is highly reccommended.	2003-07-22

The short simply written book shows the true horror when man suffers at the hand of man.  He gives descritions of various moments during his concentration stay and the reader is left knowing that these moments happend all of the time to the victims.  The humiliation, torture, and degradation were commonplace.  More imporantly. Wiesel writes about thinking at any given moment how to survive even if it meant turning his back on his friends.  He describes how various people would leave loved ones to die so they could survive themselves.  Animal instinct took over when humanity failed.  This is truly an imporant book of a first hand witness and should never ever be forgotten.  Highly reccommended.	2003-07-22

She has set up a perfect world where everybody has a place and there is no poverty.  Everybody recieves an education and health care.  there is no crime nor jealousy.  The perfect world... or so it seems.<br />Jonas, the protangonist, reaches the magic age of 12 where he is to be selected for his life's work.  He is selected to be a reciever, the keeper of knowledge and feelings for the entire past.  Jonas learns from his teacher, the giver, that everything is the same without change, ever.  The reader finds out the community doesn't even see color or have true feelings.  Throughout the book, Jonas learns of the terrible secrets of his training and the true cost to the society.  He also learns why there is a reciever and why he is so imporant.<br />Lois Lowery has shown the flip side of utopia.  If all of the bad is removed and most of the good is also removed, what is left?    An empty space.  This is great place to start children thinking about what they think of utopia and then explain what they think utopia is may not be what they really want.  This is very good book and I reccommend it.	2003-07-22

He sets his book in rural Vermont during the 1920's with a Shaker family.  The reader finds out about the young protangonist Robert and his world, which is so alien to ours.  His family is a poor religious family living by strict standards.  Robert's father wants him to receive and education because much of the world has been withheld from him for the lack of his own education.  The reader does not get this explained explicitly, but upon deeper reading realizes what the father is actually trying to teach his son.  This is the beauty of the book.  It is left for the reader to determine and figure out the message for himself instead of being spoon fed the lesson.  Late in the book Robert mentions to his father that he is not satisfied with his lot and his father replies that Robert can change his course when he grows up.  This is to signify that the father understands what Robert is feeling and acknowledges that he can try a different method, but not forget the lessons he learned. <br />Peck has written a period piece about a group of people that many Americans may not understand.  It is actually about the coming of manhood and the responsibilties that go with it.  He gives an inside view of how a simple Vermont farmer viewed the world and how hard that life could be.  Reccommended.	2003-07-22

With the hard science in, it is truly excellent.  Greg Benford deals with two different times in history, 1998 and 1963.  The 1998 timeframe has the world in the beggining of a great calamity due to pesticide overuse.  A group of physicists develop a method to send a message back in time to warn 1963 scientists of the disaster in hope of preventing it.  Most of the 1998 timeframe deals with the disaster and the various social problems developed from it.  <br />The 1963 scientists start to recieve transmissions during an experiment unrelated to the future.  What happens is that one group of scientists are labeled kooks because they originally believe that they may be recieving information from outerspace.  What the readers find out about scientists is that they are just like everybody else and will fight over trivial matters instead of concentrating on the work.  The 1963 timeframe is recieving information about long chain molecule chemicals of which it has no knowledge yet and this has set off the controversey.<br />Timescape is chock full of hard science.  Benford has written a book based on sound thoery of tachyons and more than one possible universes including mini-universes.  He has made the theories easily understandable without clouding the explanation with intricate math.  The reader can gain a working knowledge of both multi-universes and the idea of tachyons.  The fact he was able to weave these heavy ideas into a well written story is amazing.  This book is well worth the effort and is highley reccommended.	2003-07-17

His music was incredible, but his lyrics were stupid, so I thought then.  I started to pay attention to him when the rock and roll trials happened during the 1980's.  He skewered the PMRC during both the hearings and late night news talk shows.  It was this reason I decided to read his book.  What came out of the book was a very thoughtful man who looked on his life with a great deal of humor.  He writes about his early childhood along with the early years of the Mothers of Invention.  The various stories of life on the road with the hanger-ons is truly hysterical.<br />This book is not about his music per se, but how he views the world.  His decriptions of his version of the rock and roll hearings and the meanings behind them may seem a bit dated today, however they were certainly very important at the time.  Zappa also explores his views on marriage and children.  What comes across is a man who is very devoted to his loved ones and is actually very ordinary despite the insanity that seemed to surround him with the music world. His section on &quot;What Frank Eats&quot; is truly one of my favorite parts of the book.<br />My only complaint with the book is that he does not spend enough time on his later work, which I think is a true shame and he does not do analysis of his music.  As you read his book you will left thinking that he would think this portion would be a waste of time.  This is a wonderful book and is highley reccommended.	2003-07-16

The publisher did not think this book would sell because it was so simple.  What a genious Dr. Seuss turned out to be because of it's simplicity.  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish is a true children's classic because children never become tired of the book.  They will actually wear it out from use.  Older children will smile when they see the book years later and make comments along the lines \\"I loved this\\".  <br />Like all of Dr. Suess' books, it is both colorfull and whimsical.  The book teaches children to read by using nonsensical animals and ryhmes.  A child can read one little section and not become bored or lost because the book is not connected with a story.  That is the beauty of this book.  It is a childrens book written for children and their thinking.  No heavy messages here, just plain fun.  The colors catch the eye, the rhymes catch the ears, and the shear silliness cathes the imagination.  It is truly a wonderfull gift to give a parent of younger children.  Highley recommended.	2003-07-12

I now have a little skit I perform for small children of friends.<br />The moral of the book try new things.  Sam keeps to get his new friend to try green eggs and ham with more ridiculous ways of eating them as the story progresses.  The book is both colorfull, fun and can't miss with both children and adults.  Dr. Seuss wrote a learn to read book that is fun to read.  This is his genious.  Teach children a difficult task by making it fun and thus they want to do it.  If you want to put a smile upon a shy child's face, ask them if they would like to try green eggs and ham in a house or with a mouse.  highly recommended.	2003-07-12

It is the diary of an annonamous female teenager that fell victim of drug abuse.  The book should be read by every teenager about the pitfalls of drug use.  The book is stunning on two seperate accounts.  Like many well written non-fiction books, this book reads like fiction.  The diary starts off as the average teenage worries about family, friends, and lifes problems.  As the book progresses, it becomes darker and more depressing as the young lady sinks into the drug abuse.  The second front this book works on is it can be seen as a social commentary.  She writes about the pressure she faced from \\"perfect\\" parents and the loneliness she felt.  This diary was a cry for help that came to late.  There has been suggestions that it is not an actual diary, but a novel.  I personally do not believe that it is a novel because nobody has ever stepped forward to claim it as a hoax.  It is a true shame this young lady felt the pain she had and lost her way due to her drug abuse.  This book will leave the reader feeling unsettled and that is the point of reading it.	2003-07-06

This is the premis for Pastwatch.  A group of scientists using a machine called Trusite II can go to any moment in time to watch the period.  These group of scientists decide to change the voyage of Chistopher Colombis to protect the natives of the New World from the Spaniards.  <br />Card deftly blends fact and fiction to write an engrossing story from both the scientists point of view as well as Colombis.  Unlike many stories about accidental temporal time displacement, the characters intrude willfully.  The only complaint I have is there aren't any unforseen consequences from the time displacement.  It would have been very interesting if Card would have ended with a worse ending for the new world than he did because of unforseen problems.  This is a very fast read and a nice job.	2003-06-27

What if she really did exist?  Card writes about a modern young man, Ivan, who stumbles upon a sleeping beauty.  He then asks her to marry him just like the fairy tale, except he does it to prevent a bear, who is really a god from eating him.  The story progresses from Ivan following Katarina into her kingdom, which is from the Russian dark ages to fighting a wicked witch named Baba Yaga.  Card bounces nicely back and forth from the modern world to the primevil world.  His antagonist, Baba Yaga is a great evil witch who places the princess under a spell to steal the kingdom for herself.  She is at once both the ugly fairy who places a curse on Sleeping Beauty and the wicked queen of Snow White.  I could not put this book down the entire read.  It is very engrossing and fun.  Card does a wonderfull job of interweaving the reality of the old world problems and the fairy tale.  He writes about the warts left out of the fairy tales about views and medevil thoughts, but leaves enough magic in the story to leave the reader cheering at the end of the book.  This is truly a masterpiece.  I am so glad I had read it.  You will be also.	2003-06-27

It is a truly a welcomed return after his uneven &quot;Into the Gap&quot; science fiction series.  Once again Donaldson writes with passion and wonderful characters.  Most of the characters are flawed, but that makes the stories even better.  The book is very serious in tone and captures his mood very well.  There is only one clunker in the mix, although the various stories will not be for everybody.  My personal favorite is &quot;Reave the Just&quot; who deals out &quot;justice&quot;.  An added bonus is donalson writes a note to his readers what has happened to him and why he dissappeared for so long from the literary world.  The reader also finds out his writing was also a part therapy for him and does explain why so many of the stories are brooding in nature.  This is an excellent collection and should not be missed.  If you are a Donalson fan, shame on you if you missed this set of stories.  I hope he writes more along these lines.	2003-06-27

The story is about a Gorilla named Ishmael who teaches a young unamed man how to save the world and about humanity.  Except that this story is not about the Gorilla or the young man.  They are included only to move the dialog along for the reader.  The book is actually about the taker culture which most western thought is about.  Ishmael explains that the world is headed for a catastrophe if it doesn't change the thinking.  Ishmael compares the leaver culture, traditionally viewed as the hunter-gatherer, to the taker culture.  He praises the leaver as the one that is sustainable to the flaws of the taker culture that will eventually cause the fall of man.  So this book is actually about returning to the old ways and the forest?  Well no, he actually advises the reader to return to thinking about the environment like the leaver culture while still living in the taker world.  Both cultures have great benefits as well as minuses.  My problem with the book is that it is very touchy-feely and it loses some of its potency by using the gorilla as a teacher.  The book also can leave the reader with the wrong message that the Gorilla actually wants man to return to the jungle.  I was assigned this book as a college student and watched most of the students fall into the trap of the new way is wrong.  The professor was unable to convince those students that Quinn was actully saying was to think as you act and the world can't be used as everyones personal toilet.  If you read this book, take the time to understand the deeper meaning, otherwise it is a rather nice story about a Gorilla and his young protoge.	2003-06-27

This is not a book about how wonderfull Christmas is but how sick and screwed up the world is with Christmas as the backdrop.  My personal favorite story is about working as an Elf with Santa at a department store for the holidays.  The little vignettes within the story about the going ons in the Santa department is truly funny because it is true.  I worked at a famous toy chain one year and the same stories happened to me.  Not one of the stories is traditional, but written with a New York sense of humor.  \\"Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol\\" is about a serious review of children's Cristmas pagents and is every bit as blistering as if they were a Broadway play.  \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" is about one-up-man-ship of trying to keep up with the Joneses and is every bit as funny as it is sick.  If you want a book with a warped sense of Christmas that is funny, this is for you.  This is definitly not for children, but it is for their parents.	2003-06-18

This book is not for the pollitically correct, but for those who want to needle them.  Garner used different spellings of women to wommon so there wouldn't be a reference to men with women.

US	49775873	RLU9O7K3Z0XZG	034543076X	138364901	Manifold: Time	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Nice Job	The world has turned stagnant.  Big projects are not put into motion unless a profit can be proven to be made.  A maverick, Reid Malefont wants to fly to an asteroid to mine it for its wealth using genetically enhanced squid.  It is this background that Manifold: Time is written in the near future.  As he draws plans for his project, a religious fanatic convinces Reid that there is an end of the world scenario likely to occur and the only way to prevent the catastrophe is to build a radio reciever to listen to signals from the future, which he does.  The squid is rocketed to the asteroid and on the asteroid a gateway is found to other time/demension.<br />This is a well written book with a few flaws.  The character development is done on mostof the characters just to move the story along which is fine except the reader will not care one way or the other for most of them.  It is also the first story in a trilogy.  So the ending is not the best because it must open into the second book.  The basic premiss of the book is very depressing.  The end of the world for humanity, but there is a way out.  Baxter bounces from many of the characters including the squid to move his story along.  My complaint is that as long as he stayed with Malefont, the story progressed nicely.  But once he leaves Malefont, the characters are a little flat.  Malefont is a perfect example of the type &quot;A&quot; driven individual with a goal in mind and the world be damned.  He can be compared to a modern day Ahab.  Every bit as destructive and driven as the 19th century version.  Baxter also does a nice job with the squid and does not spend enough time on them which is a shame.  This book is a good read and enjoyable.	2003-06-18
US	49775873	R1KBN40V8EJ4GS	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	4	4	N	N	truly scary	William Golding addresses what happens to society if the norms are broken down and anarchy takes its place.  Golding uses English school boys stranded on a remote desert isle for his study of society.  At first, the boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as food gathering and keeping a signal fire for search and rescue attempts.  Not long afterward, Jack challenges Ralph and lures the boys away to live like savages hunting wild pigs and running around in paint.  As jack gains power among the boys, Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends.<br />Lord of the Flies is an intense look at larger society if the norms are ever overturned.  At first it is fun acting any way one wants when there are no adults to oversee.  However, the mundane chores stop being done and order breaks down.  The young children that were being looked after, just disappear without reason and nobody seems to mind or notice.  The savage group reacts alomost with casual abandon when one of the group is accidentally killed by the rest.  When order is tried to be reinstated, chaos reacts swiftly and harshly. Lord of the Flies is both a great read and a very important book.	2003-06-11

The common thread of these stories is that they are told in the feminine voice.  It is an excellent place to start if you are new to Bear or want to try his shorter writings.  There isn't a miss of the three presented here.  The only reason that I did not give this book 5 stars is that there are only three stories and it does not contain more.  Of the three stories:<br />Hardfought is  his Nebula award winning story of the engineering of human life to make a better soldier.  The story bounces back and forth between the present of the story and its past until the reader understands the true situation.<br />Scattershot is about a space ship consisting of many pieces from different universes and the constant changing the ship is undergoing with the various crews trying to cope.<br />Sisters is my personal favorite of the three stories.  It is about the unforseen consequences of human genetic engineering for  trying to bring out the &quot;best&quot; traits.  This story should be read by everybody that felt ugly in junior high school.  Sometimes getting the best traits is not always a deal.<br />This book is nice read and should not be missed.	2003-06-11

The major difference is that Heinlein writes more about the societal factors influencing his character to join the military and Steakley writes about the futility of war.  Both are excellent social commentaries.  <br />\\"Armor\\" is set in the future with the military fighting a war of attrition against an insectoid enemy.  Armor does a wonderfull job of trying to explain the bleakness of fighting against an enemy that is not understood by soldiers that are not much better than cannon fodder.  One of the best sections of the story is where Felix tells a desk jockey that he will not crawl into a hole to prove that the area is cleaned of the enemy because he knows better with his experience.  It is one of the most intense moments of the book because by this time the reader knows he is right.  In many ways this book can be read as a social critique of the Vietnam War.  This book is an excellent military Sci-Fi and should not be missed.	2003-06-11

It is a hysterical account of his exploits in Ireland where he wrote the piece.  It is also a work of fiction because he combined some of his previous short story writings about Ireland into the book.  Bradubury masterly weaves both fact and fiction into a enjoyable tour-de-force.  If you are an avid Bradbury fan, you will remember some of his earlier work and recognize the stories.  If not, then I envy you because you will not be able to distinguish fact from fiction.  Bradbury does both a wonderfull job of catching Irelands essence and terrible poverty of which he covers lightly.  He also hints at the terrible genious of John Huston without going into the gory details.  This book is a very fast read and is wonderfull.  It is certainly deserving of the national book award it recieved.	2003-05-31

It is so simple to read that many schools require Animal Farm to be read by junior high schoolers.  Yet, it is also required reading for college freshmen because of the complex nature of the story.<br />The story is an analogy for the 1917 Russian revolution and the rise of communism later.  Orwell's masterstroke was making the protagonists animals.  This way he could tell his story without acknowledging what he was really talking about.  He uses animals to portray how inhuman the former masters were and to give sympathy for animals plight.<br />Animal Farm opens with the animals chasing away the owner of the farm and the beggining of it being run by animals.  The story progresses from the optimism of the ideas of shared community to the cynicism of a power grab and the new leaders are as bad as the original ones.  Orwell describes how the new leaders change the rules slowly and in incremental steps so as not to alarm the followers.  Any opposition is either exiled or killed.  By the time the rest of the animals realize that they were swindled of their ideas, it is too late to stop the process.  The book ends where communism was in the 1970's, stagnated.  The odd part of this is that Orwell wrote Animal Farm in 1946 and much of the book is actually prediction.<br />This book is both wonderfull to read and a dire prediction.  Orwell shows how the best of intentions can be twisted into the worst of nightmares.  It is a must read.	2003-05-24

I decided to read it now to see what I was missing over the years.  What I ended with was a book I could not put down.  It is truly an engrossing book stocked full of believable characters.<br />The story works on many different levels and is weaved together masterfully.  The story is told through the eyes of the little girl Scout.  She tells the story about her hometown and the happenings in it.  The reader learns about racism of which her father is the defense attorney for a black man accused of rape.  The entire town knows he is innnocent, but he won't be released because of the color of his skin and the social mores of the time.  The reader also learns of a neighbor with mental illness that facinates the children because he is a mystery.  The best part of this book is that Scout explains the social workings of a small town during the great depression.  It is both humorous and  sad at the same time.  <br />This book is both a Pulitzer Prize winning classic and an easy read.  It is wonderfull and entertaining.  You will not be able to put it down and you won't want to either.	2003-05-24

He is full of wonderous stories that as a kid, you never get tired of hearing.  Once again he puts together a wonderfull set of stories.  I have rated this book 4 stars although it is actually 4 1/2 stars.  Not a miss among the entire group.  My only gripe with the book is that he has only one science fiction story and calling that one is a stretch.  He writes about a small circus who the ticket taker is also the star and chief cook and bottle washer and how the picked on kid in school grows up to be important.  My two favorite stories are &quot;Driving Blind&quot; about a mysterious man wearing a sack over his head and &quot;Night Train to Babylon&quot; about men on a train intent on losing their money on a rigged game of three card montey.  It is amazing that he can turn out the quality of work he has after more than fifty years.  This set of stories is less somber than some of his other short story collections and can actually be compared to &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; in its feeling.  Bradbury is still celebrating life and I hope he does for another fifty years.  This book is fun and well worth the reading.	2003-05-10

That is one part of the story.  The other is that Death takes the boys on a trip through time to show how other cultures have celebrated \\"Halloween\\" or other of the same type of holidays.  It is a joyous romp through the book and actually celebrates life with a serious subject.

Watson fills the readers in on the details of how a discovery happens from both scientific and personal perspectives.  Watson writes about how he and his partner Crick work their way towards one of the great dscoveries of the 20th century.  Watson also writes about personal dislikes and how men and women of science can be every bit as petty as their lay counterparts.  Watson writes about backbiting among the various scientists as well as the heady excitement of the work.

But calling the story just a alien invasion is not doing King justice.  This is the story of four friends that manage to always get together for an annual hunting trip and what happens to them when they are contacted by the aliens.  Dreamcatcher is as much a psychological drama as it is a scifi novel.  The are many layers to this story: the friends, the army, and one of the aliens(Mr. Gray).  How the aliens control their victims is not much fun when you think about it.  There is a twist when one of the controlled victims also can fight back against the alien in his own mind.  This story reminds the reader of War of the Worlds, except without the saucers.  The ending also remind me of the War of the Worlds.  This is a good read and it is fun.	2003-03-22

It is not a book that will make you feel good.  It certainly is not a book to replace therapy.  What it is is a great start on a long difficult journey.  Using examples from her practice, Forward explains what toxic parents are and how they can happen to families.  She explains the dynamics of dysfunctional families and how they will play roles that are assigned to the various members of a family.  What surprised me the most was how she explained how a family can turn its back on the injured party to protect the toxic parent.  It is one way a family copes.  Not everybody is happy when the problem is challenged.  If you are buying this book for yourself to help with a past, this book will give insights to what you can expect from others in the family.  If your are buying this book for general knowledge, you will be surprised how much of your own family can show up in these pages. Forward talks about archetypes and these are present in all families in some degree.  She also spends time explaining about enablers and how they also are part of the problem in a dysfuntional family.  Forward does write about succeses and about failures.  This is very important work she has done.  This is not a book for enjoyment, but it can be appreciated later on especially if you are working through problems.	2003-03-21

Yet, this is not a fair statement when he has written works such as Dandelion Wine and The Martian Chronicles.  This is still very good stuff and is very enjoyable.  The Enemy in the Wheat, The Dragon Danced at Midnight, and My Son Max ranks right up there some his best work.  The rest of this material is still better than most of what is published by others today.  I have been reading Bradbury for 30 years and have enjoyed him immensly.  It is wonderful watching him look back at the twilight years of his career and write about life.  He still has the magic.  This book is a little more melancholy than some of his other work, but there are stories in this collection that are  pure joy.  He still acknoledges his childhood heros and pays them homage.  The reader should be familiar with Bradbury to understand some of his stories or they will miss the point of why he wrote them. This is not the best Bradbury book to start reading him with, but do not miss this book either.	2003-03-09

This is such a book and it one of the best commentaries you will find any time soon.  A poet in the near future commits a gruesome murder and from there the story plot turns.  Three seperate methods are used to examine why he did the murder and Bear does a wonderfull job of exploring the underlying social standards that each represents.  The book is full of technology that seems far out by todays standards.  If you read carefully, the underlining story is not far off of what could happen.  This is a story about crime, punishment, and rehabilitation.  This book can be read two seperate ways.  One way is a social commentary, the other is a whodunit.  Both are legitimate.  This is a fantastic read that you will not be able to put down.	2003-02-20

It is some of the best work Straub has produced.  He should be wearing the mantle for gothic horror author master.  Straub reminds me of Nathanial Hawthorne with this story.  He tells the tale of an area dying into madness and the horror the various individuals have to face including people that are dissolving into water.  The only complaint I have is that Straub writes in a very disjointed style that jumps around the plot and can be hard to follow.  I think he chose this method to enhance the suspense.  If you have read either Shadowlands or Ghost Story, then you will love Floating Dragon.  It is a harder read, but it is ceratainly worth the effort.  It is my personal favorite of his books.	2003-02-20

First: The antics of the city watch which consists of zany characters.  Think of abbot and Costello meets Frankenstien.  Two: the story of what happens when man tries to play god.  The city watch must find a killer that is not part of the assasin's guild.  This is not good for business allowing non-union members to freelance.  Pratchett does a remarkeable job of exploring the Frankenstien myth with a bunch of loose screws.  This is a very serious subject that is cut with biting humor.  How bad things happen with the best of intentions.  Commander Vimes has become one of my favorite characters in the discworld series.  Any book he is the main character is on the more serious side in nature, but there is still plenty of humor.  Well worth the read.	2003-02-08

Small Gods is about the rise of a new religion through simple belief.  He satires the idea of church, but not faith.  If you do not have a sense of humor when it comes to religion, this book is not for you.  His story unfolds that every religion starts out with good intentions, but ends up mired in dogma.  You can't but help to love the turtle god and his half-wit follower.  The scene with the god and an eagle is a true classic of modern writing.  This book is part of the famous discworld series, but stands alone and apart.  This is a good book for a new reader to Pratchett to start.  If you liked Douglass Adams or satire, then you will love Terry Pratchett.  You will spend most of the time laughing along with the story.	2003-02-08

He writes about his struggles to become a teacher and what he has to endure for an education.  He writes about his students and his failed first marriage.  He writes about his struggles with alcohol and his problems dealing with his two brothers and their bar ownership and the better life they seem to have.  I laughed until their were tears in my eyes when he wrote about his wedding day.  At the same time when he wrote about his students reading essays by former students a generation earlier, some of which were written by relatives, you cannot help but be touched by the humanity of which he writes.  This book does not seem as brutally honest as the first, but it still is wonderful.	2003-01-26

This autobiography is both hysterically funny with tales of his communion to crushingly sad with the death of siblings due to poor health and poverty.  McCourt writes about his father and the problems he has with alcohol.  He also writes about his unloving aunt who also buys his first true suit for work.  For me, the most poingment moment of the book is when he comes home drunk the first time and his mother has to deal with him.  This book is a true triumph because even with crushing poverty, McCourt writes about good times and friends growing up.  This book is well worth the time and once you start, you can't put it down again.	2003-01-26

The book also spends a good deal of time on notes by Francois Truffaut, the french cinema genious who filmed farhenheit 451.

Two things crossed my mind as I read this book. 1: How are such beautiful snap shots made during the horrible period of 9/11.  For me, the most telling photograph is of the tears in President Bush's eyes.  For whatever reason to me, this image says it all for the tragedy.  2: I still can't believe it happened.  <br />This book is tough for me to look at, yet it is such a good job that I can't take my eyes off.  I live three miles from ground zero and used to work in the World Trade Centers.  I know I never will forget the first time I heard about the attack and how I watched them collapse.  This book does true justice in pictures of the days following 9/11.  The book captures the essence of the three sites in a focus that is haunting.  I have had a hard time explaining the loss of the New York skyline to people that never saw it live.  The is book shows in pictures what I cannot tell in words.

Most of the reasons were petty and personal.  Most were set for racial, ethnic, or religious reasons.  Some were set up to keep out the wrong economic types.  Most of these municipalities could not exist if the state government did not help them with money.  Karcher has done a great job of offering a historical perspective of the state that started when our country was young and continues to today.  He also has offered his vision of how to fix what is wrong with the system.  Personally as a resident of NJ, I think that I could make ice cubes in very hot places before NJ changes its way of doing things.  If you want to know why NJ is the way that it is and why it happened, then this is a great read.  Karcher is also very knowledgeable of the inside workings of the state because he was the assembly leader during much of the 1980's.	2003-01-22

Whether you agree with Bill O'Reilly or not doesn't matter.  He is opinionated and doesn't mind sharing his opinions with the reader.  His book is set much like his show.  Small vignettes that are broken with bold face headlines.  His book covers his view of the world and his personal beliefs.  He doesn't ask you to believe what he believes, only to think it through.  O'Reilly covers his upbringing through his rise in the news industry. He doesn't apologize for his arrogance because he believes it is well deserved.  He tends to be on the political right side of most issues, but that doesn't stop him from skewering the conservatives when he feels they are ducking the hard questions.  His best stories are about his dealings with celebrities and their nutty views.  A throughly enjoyable read	2003-01-22

Ann Rule has written both an in depth account of the Ted Bundy saga from an insiders point of view as well as her own remarkable story.  Ann Rule and Ted Bundy worked together at a crisis center.  The book is non-fiction that reads like a great novel.  Rule follows Bundy with a history of his early childhood that gives insight to why he might have turned out like he did.  The book also gives an account of how Bundy also viewed the world and how he tried to beat the death sentence.  The reader is left an enigma of a highly intellignet and charming man who is also a psychopath.  Rule also does a remarkable job of revealing to the reader how she originally believed Bundy to the conclusions that she was forced to realize that he was a murderer. I was left with the feeling that this book was painfull for her to write.  Rule also tells a bit about her life and how she ended writing true crime.  This book will leave you unsettled and you will not be able to put it down.	2003-01-22

It is a joy when a compilation is released and it is very good.  This is such a release.  Are these the best of the Science Fiction genre for 1995?  I don't know, but these stories are wonderfull.  When I buy short story anthologies I tend to look for authors I have enjoyed over the years.  The true gift is when I find an author I know nothing about or a new and rising author that is going to be fun to follow.  This anthology has some of the big names such as Le Guin and Silverberg who both have written execellent stories.  The true find for me was Nancy Kress.  Her 'Evolution' is about a plague and the ramifications of genetic manipulation.  Kress wrote  'An Alien light' in 1988 and I had lost track of her since.  She is truly an amazing find.  This book is well worth the time.	2003-01-20

Once again he gathers an eclectic group of Science Fiction writers that cover a wide variety of sub-sections to the genre.  He has included two tributes to science the fiction forefathers Well and Verne.  My personal favorite of this anthology was 'The Bride of Elvis', a tongue and cheek look at a religion developed around the death of the King.  I also loved 'Counting Cats in Zanzibar' by Gene Wolfe.  A robot story about a contract killing.  If you are looking for easy reading that can also provoke thought, this is a good place to start.	2003-01-20

This is supposedly the last free standing King novel before he finishes the Dark Tower epic and he retires. From a Buick 8 is not even a classic Stephen King novel. It is more subtle than most of his other work. This can be compared in style to the Dead Zone. Not true monsters, but there is evil afoot. This is a story about a car impounded by the Pennsylvania State Police, but not really. It is a car, but in name only. It is actually a door into another dimension. The story is about obsession by the troopers and the story of their encounters with the vehicle as told to the son of a trooper slain in the line of duty. How they came to have the car, why they kept it and who died because of it are all revealed. This is a stand alone novel, but if you are a King fan, you will notice that it is weaved into his Dark Tower world as he has done with most of his work. As all of King's work, it is a great read and you won't be able to put it down. It is certainly not his best work, but it is still very good. If this is his last free standing novel, then it is not a bad way to wind down. The ending of the book will make this last statement obvious. Read the book.	2003-01-20

The rainforests are being destroyed by average people trying to make a better way of life.  This is the premise for this book and it is backed up by two decades or research.  The book acknowledges there is deforestation in the Ecuadorian Rainforest, but it caused by more obscure facts than is generally reported on the evening news.  The book shows that it is not poor people driven to the jungle trying to subsist, but it is energetic people that are actually trying to improve their lives and offer a better future to their children.  The book also explains that there are cultural perceptions at work here in developing the rainforest that also helps exacerbate the situation.  This book is not an easy read.  However, if you want a text that will provide a comprehensive study on the rainforest and deforestation, this is the one.	2003-01-17

Once again Bradbury has written a master work.  From the Dust Returned sends the reader back to the people of the October Country.  His magical story about a family gathering of monsters and ghouls is interweaved with small vingettes about individual family members and their encounters.  The characters are of a dark sort, however their tribulations actually celebrate life. As time progresses, this work should rank right up there with some of his best work.  A new reader does not have to have read any of Bradbury's other works to love this piece.  As a matter of fact this novel may be a perfect way to introduce a reader to Bradbury.  I hope he keeps writing work of this quality for years to come.	2003-01-17

He has been able to tell a tale from both perspectives of the story correctly.  Cronin covers the coming of the Whites to New England and the ramifications to the Indians.  His narrative explains how the misunderstanding between the two races eventually led to fall of the Indians.  Cronin's brilliance is that he is able to show how the indians changed their way of life voluntarily which helped excelerate their downfall.  Cronin also uses the metaphor of the environment to explain the differences in thinking between the two races.  This book is not a fast read, but it is certainly worth the effort.	2003-01-17

It is used by over 150 ABA approved law schools in the country.  The reason for its influence is that it also happens to be the best written environmental law text.  The beauty of this book is that it provides incredible amounts of information in a relatively easy readable format.  Keep in mind this book is not an easy read, but it is certainly worth the effort.  The text covers such subjects as what environmental law is to how groundwater laws are different in various parts of the country.  The book also does a nice job of explaining the Federal/State battles over jurisdiction.  The cases presented as illustrations to the various subjects make the text worth the purchase price alone.  If you want to study environmental law or need the perfect reference text, then I heartily endorse this book.  This book would make a perfect addition to any personal library for future use.	2003-01-17

Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451.  All three novels were dark looks at the future of a society that had lost its way.  Fahrenhiet 451 is an a dark tale about the problems of modern life and how normal things taken for granted can be turned inside out.  Bradbury's hero Montag, is a firemean that has the job of actually setting fires to burn books.  For those of you who do not know, Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature that paper catches fire. His world is about modern convenience and the lack of intimacy that society had developed over time.  His chance meeting with another leads Montag down a path from book burner to exile on the run trying to save what he once destroyed.  Bradbury tells a tale of the redemption of a man and the hope of society by learning what is important.  It is an excellent read and very thought provoking.  For those of you who do not think that books can ever be burned, I named this review what I did because this book is on an official banned book list in the United States.  What do those who want to ban books to our children fear from this book?  Makes one wonder.	2003-01-17
US	49775873	R329DUIDIB0ZM	0446606928	691198794	Blue Light	Books	3	5	6	N	N	nice try, but incomplete	It is very hard for an author to leave one genre which they are very good at and try another.  Walter Mosley has done just that with Blue Light.  It his attempt to write science fiction.  As a whole, it is not a bad job.  However, he does not finish what he starts.  <br />The concept is that a group on Northern Californians have their lives changed when an extra-terrestrial blue light touches them.  Even people that have not had been touched by the blue light are also changed.  The narrarator is not touched by the light, but is transformed through a blood transfusion.<br />Mosley spends a great deal of time building his characters and the story line.  His antagonist is also changed by the blue light, but not in a good way.  He spends his time killing the transformed blues.  Mosley mentions him, but does not flesh him out where he probally should have.  Mosley writes a good and evil story, except that he does not do enough with the evil.  His story builds to a climax that is very anticlimatic.  What I found very frustrating was that his book ended very abruptly where he could have added 50 pages to flesh out the ending and bring in a more satisfying finish.<br />The book is an easy read that is a fast page turner.  It will be interesting to see if he stays with the science fiction or goes back to his mysteries.	2003-01-06

Cialdini writes a superb treatise on how someone is able to get you to buy something when you originally did not want the merchandise.  He shows the reader the art of persuation and the techniques that are employed.  I was personally stunned when I read about some of the techniques that were used on me by a recent young lady selling me a variety of famous cookies.  The book is written in an easy to understand language that never bores or loses the reader with stuffiness.<br />I was originally assigned this book as a college text.  I have kept it in my personal library and have recommended it to a wide variety of people.  If you ever want to understand the salesman's mind, then this is the book for you.	2003-01-06

Other than that, I believe the reading public will not be so enthralled. This is the follow-up to The Forge of God. The Forge of God is a true masterpiece, Anvil of Stars is not. The Earth is destroyed, the good guys are going to get the bad guys, and the law is the law. That is all you need to know for this book and you know it early. Bear tries to develop believable characters which he succedes at very nicely. The problem here is the story itself, which seems very disoriented and the story never seems to gel no matter how he tries to study group dynamics or species interactions. The main characters are the children of the original survivors of The Forge of God, which is a nice touch with a different view of the problem. You could do a lot worse than Anvil of Stars, but you can do a lot better also.	2002-06-16

To often the book is simply one reader's opinion (mine).  This book is  simply the best invasion book ever I have ever read.  Yes, I am including Footfall.  I originally read the book in 1987 when it first had been released.  I still cannot get the haunting story out of my head to this day.  This book is not for the light hearted.  It is depressing and the reader knows what is going to happen early in the novel. Still, it is worth the work.  Once again Bear writes a masterpiece blending hard science and well written characters.  The political reactions and realities to the aliens are believable and probable.  Once again heroes are born in the most distressing of times.  By the end of the book, you actually care what is going to happen to the human race.  Do yourself a favor, pick up this book and enjoy.	2002-04-14

He has written a book about taking stock of ones life. His protangonist has been to the moon, which would make him the envy of many people. Yet, his life is not working. So the story weaves its magic on the reader. As the story proceeds, some of lifes questions are answered for the hero, but not all of them. There is a sense of disquiet that pervades the story. Better yet, melancholy best describes this work. If you going through your own personal search for the meaning of life or want a sense of what it could be like, then I highly recommend this novel. There are no aliens or monsters with this read, but it stands along with the best of what he has written. It is truly an amazing piece.	2002-01-20

Books	5	14	16	N	N	required reading	Every now and then there is a book that takes the bull by the horns.  This is such a book.  Warning this is not a book for weak of mind! Dixie Lee Ray's premise is that sky is not falling and the planet is not collapsing.   She skillfully uses her various arguments to waylay many of the popular  myths of junk science that ends up passing for the real thing.  She is  pro-enviorment, but not a tree hugging wacko.  She wants people to use  their heads when it comes to the enviorment.  This is the type of book that  should be used against anyone who starts crying the planet is dying. It  should also be required reading for all that want a serious subject treated  fairly.	2000-08-02
