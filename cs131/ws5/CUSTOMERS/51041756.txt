The premise was so intriguing, however, that I just had to read it.  A mysterious plague - which strikes pregnant women - is sweeping the world.  The culprit comes from within, and scientists do not agree about what to do.  <br />While the storyline itself is satisfying, Bear's writing is a bit inconsistent.  At times I was engrossed with the pseudo-technical details of retroviruses and neural networks, and at other times I was turned off by the sheer unlikelihood of the situations.  Yes, I realize that this is science fiction, but it is portrayed successfully as possible truth.  Had Bear taken a few less liberties, it could have been even more affective.  <br />Others have criticized the &quot;technical&quot; writing that pervades the plot. This is a matter of taste.  It is all right if you don't get it - you will figure out what is going on very quickly.  However, if you do follow it, you can appreciate the difficulty of the positions the characters take, both personally and politically.  In my humble opinion, it enhances the book.<br />This one is well worth the read.	2001-02-14

I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this title at the library.  How much could someone write about being alone on an island?  I mean, there couldn't be too much in the way of dialogue, right?  <br />Crusoe is a great man, even if he doesn't realize it.  Paranoid and imperfect, with the need to travel abroad, he winds up by himself, on a deserted island, with precious little resources.<br />Crusoe must figure out how to get by - and thrive.  With no hope of rescue, he must learn how to change his priorities, and his outlook on life.  And when faced with new challenges, he must learn how to adapt.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, not only for the good story, but also for the life lessons learned vicariously through Robinson.  We could all use 25 years on an island once in a while.	2000-12-09

Have you ever opened up the case of your PC, only to find that there are seemingly millions of lego-esque pieces stuck together?  Have you ever wondered how computing went from the abacus to the Palm IV?  Have you ever asked how the engineers are able to do the things they do?<br />Well, ask no more.  Instead, read this book.  Charles Petzold is able to describe the workings of a simple computer, starting from the ground floor.  He begins with descriptions of a simple circuit, and slowly works his way to more and more complex structures.  You learn about flashlights, Morse code, and the early computers, and how each has impacted modern computing.<br />Will this book teach you how to program? No.  But if you were not a computer science major or electrical engineer in college, this book will lay some of the foundations for understanding this technology.  The technical aspects get a little dense at times, but this did not detract from the impact of this book.<br />If you have been curious about what goes on in that beige box, now is your time to investigate.  This is the place to start.	2000-12-07

A bit more action than the last few, and a resolution (perhaps) of a few major story lines.  Apart from that, there were several hundred pages of political maneuvering and character development.  Not that those are necessarily bad things...<br />Yes, the story moves slowly, but that is what happens in an epic of this scale.  Yes, sometimes story lines get ignored for an entire book, but other story lines get developed.  My biggest criticism is the use of convenient plot devices that have not been mentioned in the past eight books, but make their appearance here for the first time.  But I digress.<br />Have you been reading the series?  Well, you will enjoy this volume more than the last few.  Are you new to the epic?  Start at book one (Eye of the World), and enjoy.  But be warned - the epic isn't finished, and won't be for some time.	2000-12-07

Whether it is the exotic names or bright colors, or information about the economies and cultures of the world, atlases are a trove of information.  As an atlas, this book aims high, but misses somewhat.<br />This is less an atlas, and more a very well illustrated geographic almanac.  240 pages detail mineral production, economic growth, and agriculture.  Each continent gets several maps - physical, political, and bathymetric with various views - each with such detail that it makes the draw drop.<br />The atlas is not without flaws.  Each country is given a small area with a small political map, and some information about the country's economy and geographic make up.  Unfortunately, these political maps do not show enough detail to be useful.  They are too small, and leave out important features.  Some of the maps are hard to follow, especially those with many overlapping iconic symbols of various sizes.<br />This is not an American made product, and so America is treated at equal par with all of the other countries.  This is both good and bad.  You will not find detailed political maps of the states or regions of the US.  Then again, you can pick up a road atlas for $10.  The US is not the center of everybody's world.<br />I found this atlas at a competitor's discount rack for $25.  It was not a fluke - I have seen it since at this price.  For that price, it is a great deal.  For $125, there are probably better options.	2000-12-07

The 16 hour round trip was made much shorter because of this book, which is both entertaining and informative.<br />Bryson, a reasonably well respected travel writer, was born in Iowa and has spent much of his adult life in the UK.  This gives him a unique perspective on Australian culture, which is reasonably (un)related to both the US and UK in its national character.  Bryson travels to all of the populated areas, and many of the unpopulated areas of the continent.  He marvels about the desolation, fears the animal life, and examines the plight of the aboriginal peoples from an outsiders perspective.<br />Bryson's works are entertaining because he doesn't pretend to be an expert traveler.  He doesn't always know where he is going, or what he is going to find there.  He is inquisitive, often finding himself backed into a corner with wild dingos at his heels (figuratively).  In many ways, you can travel vicariously through him - he always seems to ask the questions I would ask, and notice the details that I would be interested in.<br />If you are curious about Australia after watching the Sydney games, this is a good place to look.	2000-11-26

Hillerman has a knack for weaving interesting characters, intricate  plots, and Navajo mysticism into one cohesive package.  <br />&quot;Hunting  Badger&quot; recounts a multi-departmental manhunt for three  cop-killer/thieves through the area surrounding the Four-Corners region.   Our familiar heros are faced with the task of solving the crime despite of  the best efforts of both the criminals and the FBI.  <br />My only criticism  is that I would have liked more explanation of the motivations of the  criminals, and more of an aftermath.  This book lacked some of the action  of some of the other books, but what it lacked in gunplay it made up in  interesting deduction.<br />Like his other works, it is a quick read and a  good book on tape.  And, being a reflection of an actual event, the  plausibility factor increases the interest.	2000-07-07

To them, the end product is all that matters.  Other people are not content  with that - they want to know how things work.  What magic is taking place  that allows them to watch events thousands of miles away or toast their  bagel.<br />There are few inventions as imposing as the personal computer to  understand.  Integrated Circuits, ISA connections, Hexadecimal code, and  many other seemingly complex words float around in descriptions of hardware  and software.  This book demystifies the PC - with flare.<br />Each component  of the PC - CPU, drives, printers, mouse - is described with a down to  earth, step by step description and exceptional illustrations.  It is just  technical enough to allow the power user to be satisfied, but easy enough  to understand so us non-Computer Science majors can gain some  knowledge.<br />My only criticism involves the CD - the layout was good, but  it only included some of the information in the book.  Had it been more  comprehensive, I would have enjoyed it more.<br />This is similar in quality  to &quot;The Way Things Work&quot; by David Macaulay.  &quot;How Computers  Work&quot; will answer the questions you've had about computers, and many  that you haven't thought of.  It is the perfect mix of information and  illustration.  Highly recommended.	2000-07-06

Well, Gesar is not your sanitary, American high school Buddhism.  Gesar is a warrior and superman,  and through meditation and divine interaction, he goes out and - excuse the  expression - Kicks Some Demon A**.  The demon kingdoms surround Gesar's  country of Ling, and Gesar must be victorious over them, so the populous  will turn towards the tenets of Buddhism and his country have  security.<br />Gesar is an ancient tale from the Himalayan region, and its  hero based on a real king.   The author has done his best to abridge the  major story into a form that is approachable to those of us without  extensive background to Tibetan or Mongolian Buddhism, or knowledge of the  extensive pantheon of Buddhist deities. However, I fear he has shortened  the tale too much; some of his actions seemed like they needed more  context.  Doing a book search through a university library led me to  another translation of the epic of Gesar - *The Superhuman life of Gesar of  Ling* by Alexandra David-Neel &amp; the lama Yongden.  This version is  nearly 400 pages long, compared to 150 pages.  Obviously Douglas J. Penick  took some liberties with the translation.<br />This is an exciting tale,  filled with magic, demons, and adventure.  It is a good,  \\"off-the-beaten-path\\" story that will give you another perspective on  Buddhism and an insight into the cultures of the Himalayan region.	2000-06-08

The Silmarillion is a epic tale of the first three ages of Middle Earth, before the domination of men.

Chief among these stories is the rise and fall of Melkor and curse  of the Silmarils, the priceless jewels that cause nothing but woe to all  who wish to possess them.

The entire story - unabridged- is here, with all of Denslows pictures (in black and white).  It also includes two essays, one biographical and one critical, about Oz and it's creator, L.F.Baum.<br />The biographical essay by Martin Gardner is a good overview of Baum's &quot;jack of all trades&quot; life: chicken farmer, playwrite, traveling salesman, author.  It includes many of the stories included in &quot;To Please a Child,&quot; the wonderful biography of Baum that is long out of print.<br />The critical essay concerns the history of the Oz books as literature.  Oz is considered by many both a Utopia and the first true American fairyland.  Yet, critics of children literature rarely mention Baum along with other revered authors. Russel Nye captures perceptions of Oz over the first half century in a concise, but comprehensive manner.<br />My only criticism is that it was not changed from the first edition (published 1957) to the second (published 1994), other than a brief introduction.  I would have like to have seen a review of how Oz has changed in the public consciousness in the past 43 years. <br />Enjoy this book, and enjoy the story at the end.	2000-06-07

Accompanied by dwarves, wizards, beasts, and men, the Hobbit becomes the  key figure in a quest for lost gold and lost glory.<br />This story, the  brilliant prequel to Tolkien's _Rings_ trilogy, lives up to the accolades  surrounding the stories.  The characters have depth, and the perils - as  fantastic as they are - have a vivid air of urgency.  While the _Rings_  epic may be faulted by some for including too much &quot;superfluous&quot;  expository information, the Hobbit sticks to the story at hand.  It is a  wonderful introduction to adult fantasy books for any child, and one that  would work well read out loud.<br />Young readers can easily identify with  Bilbo, the diminutive protagonist.  Small in stature and initially lacking  in confidence, the others in the expedition doubt his worth.  However,  eventually he proves himself to be invaluable to the cause and the most  rational of the party. Isn't this the dream of many children?  To leave the  humdrum everyday life, and be part of an adventure in which your abilities  prove to be the key to success?<br />Read this book as a child.  Read it  again as a teen, and again as an adult.  The story is exciting, impressive,  and just plain fun.	2000-06-01

Fairy tales are often one sided and myopic, allowing for no shades of grey in the multicolored world that is portrayed.  The villains  of fairy tales are usually the worst kind of evil: pitiless, soulless, and  irrational.  Approaching the stories from the antagonist's perspective,  alternate realities - much closer to real life - become plausible.  Hence  _Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister_, an alterna-Cinderella.<br />In the  original story - as interpreted by Disney at least - only the stepmother is  a developed character; the stepsisters are merely caricatures, devoid of  personality.  Maguire capitalizes on this void and begins to fill it.  The  stepsisters become more than a mere extension of their mother, but are  instead individuals with goals, love, and neurosis.  They are not power  hungry, but instead overly complacent with their place in the world.  Their  mother, overzealous and crazed, is not evil without reason.  <br />Like  _Wicked_, the story is turned on its head.  However, this story is grounded  in reality, while _Wicked_ retained some of the magic that L. F. Baum had  originally written into Oz.  I felt that the pace was too slow, although  the story took place over months instead of the decades of _Wicked_.   Perhaps it felt slow because I did not commiserate with the characters as  much and thus did not care if they succeeded or failed.  In truth, I  enjoyed the movie &quot;Ever After&quot; - another take on the Cinderella  story - more than I enjoyed _Confessions_.  I really felt for Cinderella's  plight in the movie, while I was indifferent to Maguire's Cinder  girl.<br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it.  A fresh  perspective to a familiar story always leads to something interesting.   What's next? A kinder, gentler Big Bad Wolf?	2000-06-01

From the conception of his campaign to its end, the essence of the Franken presidency is captured for all to see in _Why Not Me_, by  former President Al Franken.<br />When complaining about politics, people  often say, &quot;Don't look at me, I didn't vote for him.&quot;  Well, I  DIDN'T vote for him, and after reading this compilation of his speeches,  diary, and media coverage, I'm sure glad I didn't.  Here is why:<br />     1)      The ATM fees.  Pres. Franken's most controversial issue.  Sure, I lose  10%-15% of my income to the Bank fees, but that is the price you pay for  living in a free society.  Franken consistently distorted the purpose of  these fees in his speeches and literature, all reproduced here.  Banks  don't charge the fees to make money; they charge the fees so the Freemasons  can continue their subversive rule of the country.<br />     2)     Sex and  Drugs.   After the debauchery of the Clinton administration, it was  refreshing to see a president who was candid about his sexuality and his  (frequent) drug use.  The problem?  Franken and his inner circle were very  bigoted in the types of prostitutes they choose to associate with.  How can  a man who is supposed to represent all of America only consort with women  of a particular race/creed/national origin?  What about the equality of  men?  Truly a disgrace.<br />     3)     Violence.  Yes, there were some \\"Very  Illegal\\" crimes, including some involving blunt objects.  My question:  can't the man who has his finger on the button figure out a way to hide his  tracks better?  Is this the type of person we should have had been running  the country?<br />If you really want to know about President Franken, you  should read (or listen to) this historic work.  It allows insight into the  short, but uneventful, presidency that we are still recovering from.	2000-04-05

Forever distrustful of the mouse ears, I didn't know what to expect reading the real deal.  <br />Hugo is a master storyteller.  While perhaps he could be faulted for rambling on at several  points, his descriptions of 15th century Paris are vivid.  His writing is  very engaging to the reader; he always peeked my curiosity.  Perhaps the  strongest aspect of Hugo's work is his characters; while some of the  secondary characters tended to be uni-dimensional, others had great depth.   I found myself empathizing with the pitiable situations of the Hunchback  and his beauty, and even with the antagonist - pathetic as he was.  I also  found myself thinking: \\"If only THIS had happened...\\"  That is the badge of a  good book.<br />I didn't quite see the point of the chapters detailing the  rise of the printing press and the inevitable downfall of architecture.   Similarly, the chapter describing 15th century Paris would probably have  been more interesting if I was living in early 19th century France so I  could have had a basis of comparison.  If they don't interest you, just  skim them - missing them will not detract from the story.  Just be sure to  find a good unabridged translation - it can make all the difference.<br />This  book had it all: comedy and tragedy; fate and calculated plotting;  innocence, ambivalence, and ugliness.  And a performing goat.  A true  classic.	2000-03-23

Unfortunately, this one missed the high marks set by the previous story lines.<br />Q seems too human in this story;  he doesn't show the wisdom that you would expect from an entity who has  spent eternity omniscient and omnipotent.  The end of the multiverse is  first compared to a toilet, and then to the stages of coping with loss.   These images are rather base.  While I admit that some of the concepts were  interesting, the execution was off.  Picard and Data are neat, but there  are certainly plenty of other - more advanced - beings in the multiverse  that Q would have wanted to have tagging along.  <br />That being said, this  book on tape was a decent abridgement - in a blip of post modernism, Q  himself acknowledges that you are listening to the story, and should read  the book for the whole picture.  Perhaps I should interpret this story as a  fabrication by Q to amuse himself by pulling the wool over the eyes of the  reader.  As an omniscient being, he certainly knows how gullible I am.	2000-03-13

It was a multi-century search for an expensive and deadly problem - how to  calculate your position east and west at sea - one that pitted mechanics  against astronomers, educated elitists against self taught workmen. It was  a problem that was considered impossible to solve, and yet it had to be for  there to be true global exploration.  And the prize for the discovery was  threefold: a kings ransom, the praise of the establishment, and the proof  of the superiority of your method.<br />Sobel's treatment of the story was  fair.  She illuminated colorful personalities and conflicts, but for the  bulk of the book she described the bureaucratic mire and spouted  biographical information.  The tale could have been told with more drama.   How had the principal players interacted.  Furthermore, more peripheral  information about the longitude problem would have been interesting.  For  instance, how did other nations (i.e., Japan, China, Portugal, etc)  approach the problem?  <br />This is definitely a great read for all  interested in the innovative process.  If you want a good _story_ about  longitude, try \\"The Island of the Day Before\\" by Umberto Eco.  If you want  the real scope, this is the one for you.	2000-03-06

Wipe that Mist off of your Glasses	What is 40% Arthurian legend, 20% Celtic mysticism, 20% religious commentary, 15% feminist diatribe, and 5% harlequin romance novel?  M.Z. Bradley's \\"Mists of Avalon\\" is.<br />\\"Mists\\" is the epic tale of the legendary  king of Britain and his companions of the round table, recounting the whole  of Arthur's life, from cradle to grave.  Unusual to \\"Mists\\" is the point of  view.  It is written entirely from the perspective of the female  characters: his half-sister, Morgaine;  his wife, Guenivere; his aunt,  Morgase.  As a result battles and invasions are often talked about as  hearsay and recollection, but seldom occur in the story itself.  Instead,  the reader is privy to those events that the female characters would have  been present for: feast days, love scenes, and endless hours of bantering  and spinning in the royal court.  Taking this a step farther, the narration  is only omniscient for the female characters - an affective literary  device.<br />The characters have plenty of time to develop over the course of  six decades and 800+ pages.  Bradley is good at describing the changes in  personality that come with age, and isn't afraid to give each character  individual strengths, flaws, and idiosyncrasies.  For example Guenivere is  portrayed as near sighted and agoraphobic, while the brave Sir Lancelot has  a propensity towards sweet music.  However, some of the characters are  inconsistent in their behaviors, changing their minds from one chapter to  the next.  Perhaps is it was due to poor nutrition.  <br />Bradley takes the  well known story of Arthur and casts it in a different light, using the  opportunity of a captive audience to discuss just about every hot button  issue there is: abortion, rape, adoption, homosexuality, senility, and  various types of mental illness.  Chief among her issues to discuss was the  narrow mindedness of the brand of Christianity that was spreading  throughout Europe.  After a while, I felt as if Bradley had made her  points,and was beating a dead horse.  Also, the sex scenes were a tad  overdone for my buck.  The adjectives were straight out of a cheap romance  novel.  <br />This novel has a bit of everything: magic and mysticism, romance  and betrayal, plotting and plodding.

It is a balancing act, where two (or more) parties juggle individuality with partnership, often while trying  to plan a party.  I'm on my twentieth month, and I'm certainly  frazzled.  In this autobiographical tale of engagement, like many, the  problems are deeper. While the groom must overcome his post-divorce fear of  commitment, the author/bride must conquer her own anxieties in order to  live with those of another.  Their relationship seemed a bit dysfunctional  and the anxieties extreme.  Nonetheless, I found myself identifying with  their experiences.  And many rang true.  The author is witty in a neurotic  kind of way, and she is enlightened enough to acknowledge her own  irrationality.    <br />A word to potential readers: If you do not share the  authors political and social views, which are certainly tend to fall on the  liberal side of things, you will probably not enjoy this book.	2000-02-22

And like his other books, Pinker tries to  persuade the reader to agree with his assessment of thingsusing humorous  examples, occasionally odd logic, hyperbole, and in this case a 290 page  extended example.  <br />Pinker believes that the brain's representation of  language is rule based - morphology (such as adding -s to a noun to make it  plural or -ed to a verb to make it past tense) occurs because a system in  the brain applies a rule during language production.  During the past  twenty years or so, many cognitive scientists have begun to think that  perhaps this type of morphology is not rule based at all, but instead  occurs because of the specific pattern of connections in the brain.  The  goal of this book is to convince the reader that connectionism is wrong,  and a rule based system is correct.  To do this, he talks about irregular  verbs; their etymology bastardization by children, idiosyncrasies, and  production by non-typical populations.   I never thought that irregular  verbs and oddly plauralized nouns could be interesting.  I was right.  This  topic is so much more esoteric than his other books, that even his  entertaining examples could not overcome either my skepticism or my  boredom.  After a while you just want to hear something different.   Pinker  is not reporting a phenomena, and evenhandedly evaluating various  explanatory theories;  he is presenting one view to be dismantled, and  another to be exalted as correct.  But giving selective evidence could bias  his readers towards his view, and I am not convinced I was given a chance  to really evaluate the competing theories.   I anxiously await the rebuttal  by the connectionist school.   <br />If you have read Pinker's popular books  before, I can only say that this book is not at the same level.  Its scope  is much narrower, and its subject matter a bit more technical.  That being  said, if you love Pinker's way of presenting material, you will not be  disappointed.   If you haven't read Pinker before, I recommend that you  start with one of his other books - they truly live up to their  reputations.	2000-02-06

Another \\"war\\" story, complete with machismo and death and fight scenes.  Having finished the book, I now know that it is a \\"war\\" story , complete  with the pain, the camaraderie, and the illogic of warfare.  \\"Catch-22\\" is  not meant as an accurate portrayal of WWII, but instead as an farce; a  parody in which it is petty local politics and self aggrandizement motivate  the fighting, and the higher ups are more ashamed of \\"black eyes\\" than  casualties. Hmmmm, maybe it is more true to life then I thought...<br />With the  abandonment of logic comes a high degree of frustration.  I was so  frustrated with this book that I stopped reading at several points.  Many  of the situations are so ludicrous that you cry out in anguish. But that  was Heller's intention - he wanted me to feel just a hint of the  frustration the main character, Yosarian, felt as he tries to get  discharged from an Army that is as much Orwell as it is Eisenhower.  So I  embraced my frustration, and laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it  all.<br />Joseph Heller died while I was still only half way through the book.   In a way, it was fitting - he seemed to me just another character, falling  prey to the war predetor.  But Heller lives on in this story.	2000-01-11

Since I am in the thick of helping to plan a Jewish wedding, I have looked at a number of the available guides to Jewish wedding planing.  Bar none, this is the best.  It treats weddings not only as the social events they  invariably are, but also as the spiritual event we all want them to be.   This is a tall order considering that the adjective \\"Jewish\\" applies to  Hassidic Jews and egalitarian Reform Jews both.  Anita Diamant is  successful at pointing out the way one can make their wedding feel more  \\"Jewish,\\" no matter what the level of observance.  She details the ceremony  and the significance of all of its elements, but does not advocate one set  of values or beliefs in lieu of another.  Using real examples, she is able  to illustrate that you can utilize the rich set of Jewish wedding  traditions to make your wedding uniquely yours, and distinctly Jewish - as  you define it for yourselves.    <br />This book seems to have been written  for Conservative and Reform Jews who may not be aware of all of the  elements of a Jewish wedding.  However, even if you are more traditional in  your beliefs, you might appreciate this book as a resource for ideas.   <br />Another, unrelated, point - Anita Diamant speaks not only to the bride,  but also to the groom.  She does not take us for granted, men.  The only  drawback of this book - and this is a minor point - is that it was written  fifteen years ago, making some of the resources out of date.  Do not let  that stop you from purchasing the book - most of the information it  contains is timeless. <br />Not only did my sister-in-law give us a copy when  we announced our engagement, but our rabbi made it compulsory reading.  My  love and I are both grateful that they did.  If you only buy one book, this  should be the one.  Mazel Tov.	2000-01-02
US	51041756	R2IKE9OT6ZOIUI	0439136350	667539744	Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban	Books	4	1	1	N	N	As Harry matures, so does his story.	The third in the popular Harry Potter series was a perfect successor to \\"Chamber of Secrets.\\"  Again wicked forces want to destroy Harry and his friends, and again it is up to them to stop the destruction.  The new creatures, courses, and characters fit in well with the world that J. K.  Rowling has created, and you and/or your child will grow to love or despise  each and every one of them. It retained the magic, mischief, and  intelligence of its predecessors, but had a more mature tone. The villains  and evil creatures had a much darker presence than those of past books, and  the meddlesome Muggles (non-magic populus) even more odious. <br />In a sense  the writing has grown just as Harry has in the past three years.  Some of  the themes are a lot less whimsical: death, revenge, and powerlessness.   The plot, too, is more mature.  Concepts like time travel paradoxes could  be over some heads, and the plot lines were rather involved, compared to  the first two books.  Know the child you are giving this to.  Perhaps the  young reader has grown at the same rate.<br />I could imagine being a ten year  old and fantasizing about all of the wonderful things I could do if I had  one fourth of Harry's powers.  I could also imagine identifying with many  of the struggles of Harry and his friends- bullies, adults who don't  understand you, overextending yourself, and trying to fill the shoes of  older siblings. <br />As an adult who grew up on the innocence of the Oz  series (L.Frank Baum, Ruth P. Thompson), I was reminded of the enjoyment I  felt reading about such fanciful adventures. I think I would have enjoyed  the Potter series when I had graduated from the Oz books.  I certainly  enjoyed them now.  I can't wait for book four.	1999-12-31

My fiancée hated this book; she told me it nothing but fish and machismo - futility personified as a short novel.  After absorbing the story, I cannot agree with her.  While it may appear to be nothing but a fight between an  old man and a big fish,  it is more.  It is struggle.  It is pain and  perseverance.  It is the acknowledgment that sometimes defeats look like  victories, and victories defeats.  <br />That being said, I can now also say  that I am not a fan of Hemingway's choppy writing, his overly overt  masculinity, or his cavalier attitudes towards death and pain.   But it is  worth reading, especially if you like the things do not.	1999-12-26

Lets face it - Planning a wedding is stressful, and a Jewish wedding is no exception.  Unfortunately, this book did not help me very much in planning for my wedding (September, 2000).  The illustrations are cute, and the  bredth of topics is large, but the details of the wedding never go farther  than the surface.  The book seems to be written for a &quot;general&quot;  jewish wedding, whatever that means.  That is, it skirts over the  differences between sects in Judism, speaking in generalities instead of  specifics.  If this is the only Jewish wedding book you have, you are going  to have more questions about the traditions of the wedding immediately.<br />I  was especially annoyed that the author just assumed that she was speaking  to the bride, and not the groom.  I quote from the introduction:  &quot;Mazel tov! You're engaged, soon to be married, and you, your future  husband, and your parents are doubly blessed.&quot; Lovely sentiments, but  who am I, chopped liver?  I am the one reading the book.  I was also  disappointed that such a small percentage of the book was devoted to the  ceremony itself, with the lionshare of the book detailing who should pay  for what, and why you shouldn't invite your father's business friends.   These things are important, but they are not specifically  &quot;Jewish&quot; in nature - those things can be found in any Bride's  magazine.<br />If you really want an excellent guide, try Anita Diamant's  &quot;The New Jewish Wedding.&quot;  It goes into much more depth about the  ceremony, and explains how to make the wedding yours in a spiritual sense.  And good luck on your wedding (or the wedding of a loved one).	1999-12-26

The characters seemed like passing shadows - I never knew them well enough to have any solid emotional attachment.  The stories  were all very short, and most felt incomplete.  If you are just starting  with Hemingway, try something else first.  If you like his style, I'm sure  you'll love this collection.	1999-12-26

As some of the reviewers here have noted, none of the ideas in  the book are very \\"deep\\" or \\"surprising.\\"  Unfortunately, these ideas are  often forgotten or ignored, and this book reminds us to stop and appreciate  things.  Mitch, the sports commentator who spends several Tuesdays with his  dying college mentor, is not angelic by any means; it is probably not  altruism alone that compels him to visit Morrie, but circumstance, guilt,  and a need to understand his own relationships.  I think many of us can  identify with Mitch, who has traded in some of his youthful idealism for  success and money.  As he learned from Morrie, so should we all.<br />Lets get  a few things out in the open.  This book was full of sophomoric writing,  trite moralizing, and odd aphorisms.  Between the chapters recounting the  Mitch's visits, we find anecdotes about both the author and his subject:  their origins, their sufferings, and their idiosyncrasies.  Unfortunately,  there is not enough expository information to get a complete picture of  either of them, only enough to get a feel for their respective  personalities.  I personally would have liked to know a bit more about  Mitch - the book was as much about his struggles as it was about Morrie's.   The book's faults do not in any way negate the importance of Morrie's  message to the world - live life.  It is an important message even if this  is not great literature.	1999-12-25

This is the record of what he saw  on his trip, from the deep South to the Pacific Northwest, fishermen to  farmers, through forests, snowstorms, deserts, and beaches. <br />This novel  was deeply personal, and it reflected a feeling I have had in my life to  explore the world by experiencing it first hand, not by reading about it in  the book.  However, sometimes the author seems overly sentimental,  bemoaning the loss of regional distinctiveness and lambasting  the  homogenization of America while not always acknowledging that sometimes  changes happen for the better.  America has always been a country of  change, and he realizes that change is always accompanied by a little bit  of pain. <br />As he travels, the philosophizing is not overly explicit.   Neither are his personal problems, which are alluded to but not expounded  upon.  Instead, he lets the people he meets and his experiences with them  speak for themselves.  Unfortunately, there is nothing very cohesive about  the stories, no incentive to get to the end except to see the author's  cycle completed.  Perhaps a second reading would allow me to pay more  attention to the author's personal struggle, but even so, the stories are  basically independent, with only the underlying theme of coping with change  to tie them together.  Perhaps that was the authors' struggle all along.	1999-12-20

The style manual, list of US  Presidents and Vice Presidents, and reproduced patriotic documents is a  cute touch.<br />In this age of extensive web based dictionaries, some  overlook the importance of a tangible, paper resource.  Thumbing through  this dictionary reminds you of why the web can never fully replace paper  documents; the discovery of words in the context of the language as a  whole.

After getting through this monumental work, I was amazed at the rather blunt way Melville got his point across.  The foreshadowing was less than subtle, and the characters almost transparent.  But I guess the point was  not about the characters, but about ourselves; the real monster is within  us, not outside. I found the commentaries on the whalers world view to be  quite entertaining, as was the layman's taxonomy.  The book lived up to its  reputation as a true classic.	1999-12-07

These stories give a perspective of the future and our relationship with technology that is different than the prevailing  &quot;trekkish&quot; view, and one that may not be so optimistic.  While  sometimes the stories are nothing more than thinly veiled logic puzzles,  they are always entertaining - and sometimes infuriating.  And the  differences between Asimov's vision and today's technologies (No PCs? No  Printers? Huge Mainframes?)is amusing see in hindsight.  A must read for  any sci fi fans.	1999-12-07
