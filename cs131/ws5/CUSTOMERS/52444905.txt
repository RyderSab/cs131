I bought this book after reading the 2005 LA Times story of the police medical examiner who believes Monroe did not kill herself.  He believes she was administered a morphine overdose by suppository.  Also, the psychiatrist who was very close to Monroe at her death and was criticized for this closeness believed the same theory.  In the LA Times article, this book was mentioned as a definitive journal of her life and death.  Also, it alluded that the psychiatrist's statements were shared with this author and in this book.  Therefore, on that recommendation that this was the definitive Marilyn Monroe book, I felt a need to understand and investigate her life and death.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  I remain absolutely amazed at the completeness of the research involved in this book.  Be forewarned this is not a short read.  But it is well worthwhile.  He completely documents disagreements in sources and presents clearly his beliefs based upon the research.  An important fact from early and mid-life that I had never seen emphasized was exactly how few movies she made at the end of her life, something like only 5 in the last 10 years.  In my 52 year lifetime, Marilyn clearly had the most unique combination of sex and innocence that drew people in.  It's difficult to describe her appeal.  Probably closest would be Pamela Anderson who unfortunately feels the need to wear massive make-up hiding the very attractive wholesome girl she was when initially discovered.  Much like Marilyn.<br /><br />But where this book is at its best is describing the DiMaggio/Miller marriages, the many close friendships late in her life and what they expose about her potential suicide, the Kennedy relationships and ultimately her death.  These story lines are so engrossing that it is difficult to put the book away for the night but the book is such a time commitment that it's not the type to be read in a few hours.<br /><br />I cannot stress how detailed is the research on the last three years of her life including Sinatra, Lawford and the Kennedys.  Based upon all the exhaustive research, I still believe this was a suicide.  She had tried too many times before and sadly, was totally addicted to narcotics.  What is more interesting is her relationship with the Kennedy's.  But would they really have been involved in foul play when at that time the press ignored politician affairs?  Marilyn's life is a great tragedy and this book does a fabulous job of summarizing.  I strongly recommend this book if you have any interest in this icon.  Be forewarned.  This is not a quick weekend read but well worth the hours spent.three years of her life including Sinatra, Lawford and the Kennedys.

Is it great literature or life altering?  No.  But if you want a quick summary of Roscoe's life and enjoyable times in the opening era of  professional tennis, it's all here.<br /><br />Raised in an upper middle class background in the South, Roscoe quickly summarizes his early life and influences and how he fell into tennis.  Given the incredible amount of work required today to be a professional, it's almost laughable how a talented individual such as Roscoe could stumble into a professional career given that it wasn't the focus of his life as required to survive in today's tennis world.<br /><br />One of the first interesting facts learned was Tanner's recruitment at Stanford.  After signing with Tennessee, he eventually goes to Stanford and is considered by some as the most important recruit at the university as at that time UCLA and USC were clearly the best teams in the Pac-8 and the nation.  Roscoe and subsequent teammates like Sandy Mayer changed all of that.<br /><br />From a stellar college career Roscoe moves on to the pros with a wife in tow and the thrills of the road overcome his marriage.  Ironically, he divorces his wife over a Colorado girlfriend who immediately clarifies that this was only a fling for her, poetic justice at its best.  The book becomes somewhat of a whitewash of his extracurricular activity outside of marriage including in passing a call girl encounter that leads to a child.  One can only think that this wasn't the first time that the book seems to imply.  From there it's a quick downward spiral in to poor investments and dishonesty that end with him in jail and deeply in debt.  His stories of jail bring home how this wealthy child/adult could have fallen so far.  With a quick credit to religion, Tanner presents a happy ending that one can only roll your eyes at.  I wish him the best but it's easier to present your side in a book than actually live it.  I did however, recently hit with a pro in Orange County that talked of Roscoe and had nothing but good things to say about his current commitment.  I hope that ends up being the case.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book to this tennis fan was Tanner's description of life on the tour with the other pros.  While close to his age, I wasn't aware that Tanner was doubles partner with Arthur Ashe.  This brings up many interesting stories and Tanner actually does a better job describing Ashe's personality than he does his own.<br /><br />In closing I would say I really enjoyed this book.  Mainly because the subject is of extreme interest.  Did the book go into enough depth on Roscoe?  Absolutely not and that would be my main disappointment.  But it is an enjoyable read of a tennis legend and for me that was enough.h a pro in Orange County that talked of Roscoe and had nothing but good things to say about his current commitment.

I'm 52, married, don't know the author, have never heard of this secret society and still found this book fascinating.  I say this because so many reviewers seem to have an agenda.  From the arrival of this book b4 a business trip where my wife asked if I was going through another mid-life crisis, to the enjoyable but staccato writing style of Strauss, I read this book in pure fascination but half the time wondering if it was fiction.  From reading these reviews it is clear there is basis for this book.  But a Project Hollywood with male drama and Courtney Love thrown in for humor?  Well, evidently it was true.<br /><br />This book should be read by all young men.  Yes, some have the ability to approach women in some manner, but most DON'T have the ability in ANY manner.  This book will help.  Does it give contrived starting lines?  Sure, but the point of the book is, \\"men need it\\" and when most people think of pick-up lines, these are actually exactly the opposite as more fully explained in the book.  We are not conditioned to know the appropriate way to approach women!  But apparently, we can learn.<br /><br />This book is educational on talking to women but also an interesting story about the crazy, neurotic lives these guys live.  As to the author, his writing style is much too young for me but I did enjoy watching him weave this story and predict a bright journalistic career for him.  I had previously read his biography of Jenna Jamison and enjoyed it also.  I have not seen much publicity about this book.  I heard about it from the short story in Esquire.  I would love to read the NY Times article referenced in the book.  I recommend this book for both men and women in their dating years but also recommend others read this that just want to learn about interpersonal relationships or read a zany life of needy men.	2005-09-23

As an avid reader I strongly prefer to read the material prior to seeing the movie.  But my interest in the movie and the exceptional writing, directing and acting compelled me to study whether this was an abortion of the book (Semi-tough) or massive improvement (Less than Zero).  To my surprise, the movie followed the book including dialog 90% of the time.  Yes, the ending is somewhat different but nothing that destroys the central story line.  I find that interesting given that [...]lists four screenplay credits including Hornsby.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book of relationships and interpersonal problems that I highly recommend.	2005-08-25

This is a bad book, pure and simple.  The author spends an inordinate amount of time talking about his history of losing money and making money.  But the stories aren't in great detail and come off as braggadocio.  In addition, his advice is minimal and simple.  He goes through the time value of money and how yields on small amounts of money invested for many years will allow you to retire well off but doesn't really give creditable advice on retiring really rich, other than buying his newsletter.<br /><br />I cannot emphasize enough how bad this book is.  Only two other times have I not read a book I started in its entirety.  Here's number three.  I read the first half and scanned the last half.  I assure there was no improvement.  Take a pass on this turkey.	2005-08-09

This book is a rehash of how investors were mistreated and how Wall Street participated willingly.  And given that it is written by an investment banker with over ten years experience, it does have some credibility.<br /><br />What this book does well is give great background on the scandals focusing mainly on telecom and utilities.  In addition to the general background of Wall Street and the climate in the stock market, she does an exceptional job of providing regulation and deregulation background.  But this book eventually wears you down.  Maybe that's my fault.  Having taken a large WorldCom loss followed by substantial profits in the beaten down utilities in light of Enron, I thought the subject matter would be right up my alley.  But it's repetitious so if you read WSJ, Businessweek and NY Times, you've already read all of this.  With the possible exception of her detailed coverage of the regulatory environment affecting the utilities.<br /><br />In summary, I was interested in a business biography.  What I received was a detailed, complex college textbook analysis of this unique investment period and the excesses that caused such a great loss of wealth.  Maybe it's just my fault for having read too much but in summary, this book was too detailed and too repetitious and I didn't enjoy it.  Read at your own risk.	2005-07-28

Originally from California but having grown up mostly in the South, as a 52 year old male I looked forward to this summary of the civil rights movement.  This book is MUCH better than I expected and would put it in my Top 10 of all time.  First of all, as the premier writer of the civil rights movement mainly in Mississippi and Alabama this first hand account sheds new light not only the events that have been reported but also the emotional mentality of the crowds, the offended race AND the reporters caught up in the story.  I live in Memphis and have seen racism and to this day, subtle racism.  But the description in this book of the open disregard for the law and willingness to kill, maim or intimidate with no fear of retribution is eye-opening.<br /><br />But this book is much more than civil rights.  Growing up at the end of the depression Karl Fleming gives an account of a different family life in a less affluent time.  Reading of he and his sister being sent to an orphanage is heart wrenching.  This event obviously has long lasting effects on his relationship with his mother.  This section and his initial jobs in the Navy during the war and upon return as a cub reporter gives great insight to a mystical life growing up in the charming South that so many Southerners would prefer to revisit.  If I have one complaint it is that he later only mentions his sister in passing.  How did she emotionally survive this ordeal.  I'd really like to know.<br /><br />The third act of this book is of a mature reporter whose family is dissolving as he enters a relationship with a new woman to whom he is still married to this day.  But it also touches on the cultures of the 60s with his interest in booze and later drugs.  While he does not spend as much time here, there obviously is a bigger story as he enters a difficult time financially, professionally and emotionally as he confronts his divorce, his demons and his past.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in what life was like living in the South in the middle of the century as well as life during the depression and the following war.  If you have any interest in the civil rights struggle read this account to truly feel the emotion that movies such as Mississippi Burning poorly convey.  As a companion book I recommend \\"The Glass Castle\\" which tells of another unique survival in a poor family.  I bought this book and couldn't get motivated to read it immediately but am very glad I did.  Read this book for enjoyment and to learn.

WOW!!!  Not sure I would have bought had I read this first.  But she does give an exceptional summary of dreaming of living on the beach in the mid 80s and the number of years and twist and turns it took to accomplish her goal.  In addition to all the information on what not to do and on the construction business climate (or lack thereof) in Mexico she provides an entertaining story of achieving her goal.  And, while I'm watching a hurricane track onto my property this weekend, she forewarned that this is a constant issue and even gave insight into how potential damage could be avoided.<br /><br />While not included in the book I must editorialize that the climate in Mexico has changed drastically for foreigners buying ocean front property and one should not be near as worried as in the past.  However, it is still a \\"cowboy\\" climate where buyers should beware.  I have seen property sold where the owners cannot build unbeknownst to them and I've seen zoning issues strangely held up.  Values of land on legal documents are rampantly understated to save taxes for the seller to the point of sellers refusing to sell if the buyer doesn't agree to this fraudulent practice.  And, finally, do government officials tend to have their hands out for bribes?  While I have not seen this I do hear stories.  On the positive side, the people of Mexico are quite charming and the influx of a large European population makes for an interesting mix of neighbors.<br /><br />Maybe the author will update her book for her recent history.  I searched the Internet for her name and found a bookstore she started and later sold.  She is still in Mexico and still loving it.  If you want an interesting history of buying property in Mexico that is both entertaining, funny and educational, I strongly recommend this book.	2005-07-19

From a drug deal gone south, through the Washington political intrigue, I found this book very enjoyable. Obviously the author has good understanding of the Yucatan geography as he takes the tourists caught in this web through Mayan ruins, to resort towns, to homes along the coast in this thriller.<br /><br />If there is a criticism, the author may have tried to include too much with the drug agent gone bad, Washington political intrigue, undercover drug agents, shaky marriage, and wealthy kingpins in Mexico just to name a few of the subplots that must be cleared before the end of the book. Nevertheless, so many of the action points are quite intriguing so it's worth muddling through these subplots. For archeological buffs, there is a great section of intrigue located in a Mayan temple that is quite interesting.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and would read this author again without the geographic interest of this location. This is a great book to read on vacation but is not a short 200 page read and does require some attention with so much going on.	2005-07-14

More specifically, it is for movie fans that also enjoy the \\"business\\" side of the business.  Harvey & Bob Weinstein, founders of Miramax, are clearly the models for this book. The book is written by a worker at that studio and interestingly, the book publisher is also a Miramax firm.  Given how these \\"Masters of the Universe\\" have conducted their business that in of itself is very surprising as they have never enjoyed any negative criticism.<br /><br />This book describes the mundane chores working at the firm and the egocentric, maniacal personalities of the primadonna executives.  I suspect people closer to the business can pick out the executives below the Weinsteins.  Most movie buffs will not have that much knowledge.  If you would like to know more I would also recommend \\"Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of the Independent Film\\".<br /><br /> I enjoyed the book and found the stories interesting, bizarre and very believable.

In working with an architect from France and the relevant language issues (French, Spanish and English) I needed a starting point to state my ideas of what I wanted to design.  I have many other books such as Casa California but needed something with specific architecture in the Yucatan Peninsula.<br /><br />After our original drawings I bought this book.  My architect laughed at our next visit as he had the same book with much more wear on it.  His other clients had been using it to describe thoughts and just referring to page numbers.  In my case our ideas were established prior to discovering this book.  But the book allowed me to visualize many of the ideas incorporated by our architect.  The pictures are beautiful and the author does a great job providing a historical perspective on the styles.  My architect said it is worth planning a trip to view many of the homes in the book and I hope to do so in the future.  My compliments to the author for successfully capturing the culture of this unique area of Mexico.<br /><br />In the next year I hope to buy authentic Mexican furniture.  I have heard in Guadalajara there are places to buy this furniture prior to massive mark-ups through distribution.

Having grown up in California in the 60s, going back to the strip for visits in the mid-70s, and visiting quite often in the 90s to today, I've always been fascinated by the vibe of the street.  My favorite hangout was the Roxbury in the early 90s.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job covering Rock focusing on the Whiskey a Go Go, the ultimate rock/nightclub venue that brought in changing music and the celebrity culture.  From the beginning days of celebs such as Johnny Carson attending to see Johnny Rivers through the most famous period of appearances by the Doors this book has a story to tell.  But it goes in to much further depth with help by the eventual owner, Mario, as he described the evolution, the up and down years, and the other joints that became Rock n Roll royalty hangouts designed to keep fans away where the stars could hang out without much fear of being exposed.<br /><br />I ran into a scathing review on the Internet that talks of the many inaccuracies of this book.  But after reading the inaccuracies stated, I found them to be more faulty memory and slight embellishments rather than gross lying.  Therefore I still recommend this book but encourage you to do your own research before taking everything at face value.  For me, this book fills in a lot of holes and projects great Rock history.  I encourage you to read this book specifically if you have interest in Rock n Roll in the 60s and 70s.	2005-07-11

A homeless person who just happens to be her mother.<br /><br />Jeanette Walls grew up with free spirited parents.  Had they been born 10 years later they would probably have been identified as hippies.  They are highly educated but don't care to live a normal environment where caring for your children is your highest priority.  Rather, they want to live in the desert areas of the Southwest looking for the next adventure and dreaming of the day they will be rich from the bizarre ideas of her father.<br /><br />From the unique existence in the Southwest always moving in the middle of the night presumably before the sheriffs or bill collectors catch them they eventually end up in West Virginia, home of her Father's family.  Her Father had some good qualities which unfortunately were overridden by his alcoholism and seeing his family background allows you to see how he ended up where he did.  Ever lived in a house without plumbing, heat or insulation?  How about having rain coming down on your bed?  Eventually the kids almost take on an adult row and when they move out, the parents eventually follow which creates a new set of issues.  If I have one complaint, Jeanette had a younger sister who is not as fortunate as the other kids in escaping their environment and she suddenly moves to California.  The reader receives no further updates.  I would be very curious to hear how she is doing.<br /><br />This is not the typical book I read, business or sports books.  But it was extremely engaging and you will learn a lot of a different lifestyle.  I can see females enjoying this book more as the author writes from that perspective.  I strongly recommend this book for everyone wanting to learn about our great country and how you can overcome your environment to be successful.

And while that is in this book, Wilder's flippant writing presented this part in an interesting manner before quickly moving the book to his career in New York.  After reading this book, you'll realize he is not exactly who you thought he was.<br /><br />Being 52 I just assumed this older actor was a comedian by training.  I couldn't have been further from the truth as he was trained as an actor from the beginning and really only fell into the comedic roles after studying with Lee Strasberg at the Actor's Studio.  It's interesting to hear him describe his early connection with Mel Brooks through Anne Bancroft that eventually led to great fame in Blazing Saddles and other hilarious movies.  Wilder used a unique strategy at the end of many chapters concerning his career successes.  In a sentence he states the contact that led to the contact that led to the person hiring him that got him the famous role.  I've always felt life is a series of forks in the road where you never know what is on the other fork and deal with what you have chosen.  He gives credit for his successful forks by showing how this contact was reached.  One of them was through his very short unhappy marriage to his first wife so even though the marriage was a complete flop, relationships were made through acting together that eventually led to Mel Brooks.<br /><br />Wilder does a great job of exhibiting his warts.  He fits the role of a typical neurotic, Jewish actor?  Years of psychotherapy may have helped him or it may have been just a crutch he needed.  It's really never clear.  All of these issues center on his inability to maintain healthy relationships.  The most serious example is the loss of his adopted daughter (his second wife is the real mother) who for reasons not explained does not interact with him.  Of course the most famous relationship is with Gilda Radner.  Unfortunately, many \\"fans\\" will be disappointed that the \\"fairy tale\\" is not the same in true life.  Personally, I believe he honestly let you into his life and exposed himself instead of giving the publicity package we are so often given.<br /><br />In summary, this is his life told truthfully, both good and bad, in a flippant funny writing style that I really enjoyed.  It is a fast read that I couldn't put down finding it quite touching in many parts.  I strongly recommend this book for a great beach read or a deeper look in to Gene Wilder's soul.th Gilda Radner.

There was a time I looked forward to the latest Stuart Woods books.  His books read faster than any other author's, the perfect beach read book.  I particularly like his short chapters that leave a cliffhanger and won't let you stop until you've read just a little more.  This book takes you back to some of his best work in the beginning and middle of his career like White Cargo, Swimming to Catalina and New York Dead.<br /><br />Woods returns to a period piece of a Los Angeles detective who quickly finds him working as a studio detective who must protect actors & actresses from their many vices and various bad guys.  Obviously that provides plenty of love interests for his main character.  What makes this book different is that he overlays the main characters with a few chosen stars.  In addition, the main protagonist is clearly written after Johnny Stampato who died at the hands of Lana Turner's daughter.<br /><br />All of this makes the book interesting and extremely readable.  Woods writes his books as personal fantasies.  That's why the good guy, pseudo Woods, always gets the girl, always wins the fights, and always enjoys Woods' hobbies such as flying, sailing and in this case, fly fishing.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in a fast, enjoyable read on the beach without trying to tax your mind.  Escape from the office in this book!	2005-06-30

I started tennis late but being athletic quickly could play above my experience.  Eventually I hit the wall, getting beat repeatedly and having the complete inability to be a human on the court.  This book simply showed me what was really going on in my mind.  And, more importantly, that it goes on in everyone's mind to some extent.  Not being a philosophical person nor a follower of Eastern Spirituality, these very basic concepts were Greek to me.  But they make certain logical sense.<br /><br />Having said all that, I'm still not sure exactly what I need to do for a complete change.  I know I need to stop the Self 1 and 2 conflicts occurring in my mind and I need to concentrate on minor things like breathing rather than let my mind wander to failure.  But how I will be able to apply this is still somewhat of a quandary as I am so regimented in my approach.  One thing is for sure, I need to make the attempt.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book highly whether a tennis player or not to look at your activity from a totally different light.  To me the most compelling statement is that this book was written due to a \\"dumped\\" volley on match point to win the Boys National Championship.  Having \\"dumped\\" and choked many points on a much lower level, I can understand the inspiration for the book.  Read this book for a different perspective.	2005-05-19

Was it really worth the time and expense to catch a bunch of small-time gun runners, dope sellers, and miscellaneous crimes such as wife abuse and various assaults?  This isn't meant to demean the excellent undercover work by Bill Queen but as I read the book my first thought was whether it was really worth the time/money not to mention risk to Bill Queen.  For example one of the main gang members who Queen initially meets is Rocky.  But he's not a major player.  Abusive to his wife, can't hold a regular job, neglect bordering on child abuse and yes, he is a small time thief, gunrunner, drug user/seller and miscellaneous assaults.  At some points I found myself laughing at these overgrown adolescents who really just want a sense of brotherhood.<br /><br />And that is where the book is the best, describing the camaraderie of being a member of the club.  When Queen's aunt (think quasi-mother) dies, he hits on how touched every member of the Mongols were but his ATF partners showed no such compassion, probably just because they are busy with their own lives.  He also overlays how this time-consuming operation damaged his family relationships and eventually led to his ex-wife and kids being moved for fear of retribution.  But the summation statement of this book is when the Mongol arrests start and a fellow Mongol calls to tell him they know who the snitch is and they are going to kill him.  Unfortunately, they don't realize it is Queen so he has to disclose that he is the snitch to save the other member's life.<br /><br />Other than feeling that the story was somewhat exaggerated to make this mini-crooks look like the worst people in the world this is an entertaining book.  Not the fastest read I've had but if you are like many Americans and fascinated by current day outlaws it is enjoyable.	2005-05-17

Was this helpful?  Absolutely!  Does it completely cure the problem and will listening to this make your problems go away?  Absolutely not!<br /><br />This tape hit right on the problems I had.  That there is an internal conflict between my physical self and my ego.  My ego makes me play tight when playing lesser talented people.  It restricts my mental thought process when I'm getting beat by better players making me mad at myself instead of focusing on how I should try to cure the problem.<br /><br />Let me give you an example where it immediately helped.  I'm an adequate server but can be prone to double fault issues.  This tape asks you to visualize the stroke or a part of the stroke you are struggling with and how to correct it.  Now, that sounds simple.  But instead of doing this, I was mentally losing it thinking of nothing in particular until I fulfilled my destiny with a double fault.  In case you haven't noticed, it's a village idiot writing this review but at least I recognize this.  I was actually surprised how well these simple adjustments in attitude helped.  I'm still working on all the negative discussions that I have with myself on court.<br /><br />Who knows, with a little work, maybe I'll be considered a normal humanoid.	2005-05-13

Dole is a retired politician who in his year's of reflection decides to write about the most significant event of his life, his service in WWII, the subsequent life-threatening injury, growing up in middle-century America and the support he received to overcome this devastating injury.<br /><br />This is a simple book that could have been written by thousands of WWII vets.  Unfortunately, they are not famous and Bob is so in many respects Dole is writing it for them.  He writes this book with no ego and no political agenda.  In fact, he writes of his relationships across party lines and as he discusses his involvement with the WWII War Memorial there are great discussions on his excellent relationship with Bill Clinton.<br /><br />Where this book is most fascinating is describing his struggles going to college and the mindset of Americans as Pearl Harbor is bombed.  Then you see the thought process of these young men as they decide whether to enlist and what should they attempt to do in the armed services.  Pre-battle training is covered extensively but mainly from the standpoint of relationships with family through the letters included.  Unfortunately, Dole's time in battle was limited as he is wounded almost immediately.  So whole the build-up of this battle is compelling, it ends quickly.  Then the amazing tale of how he was rescued at great risk and somehow managed to survive is told in great detail.  Most Americans know he was injured but how many know of the months he was laid up paralyzed?  Or the life threatening infections he fought off with experimental drugs?<br /><br />This book is not for everyone.  If you are looking for a war book, this isn't it.  Political intrigue and partisan politics?  Pass on this read.  But to reflect family life in a simpler America and the struggles of the heroic WWII soldiers, this is an excellent book and well worth the read.ldiers, this is an excellent book and well worth the read. <br /> <br />	2005-05-13

There were a couple of chapters on the psycology of tennis and how to deal with nerves and pressure.  I found those helpful.  The famous sports psychologist, Jim Loehr was quoted in there quite a bit.<br /><br />While I did not buy the book for stroke production that is the substantial part of the book and they covered every shot imaginable with emphasis on their \\"Smart\\" approach.  This is a large book that I could see in any Tennis Pro's office as it is great reference material and you could hand out to students who wanted to read more on a problem.  Also, there were quite a few references to drills to preform on different shots.<br /><br />Overall a very good, informative book.	2005-05-13

Jane is a fascinating person who was fortunate to lead a public life in very interesting times.  She has made an honest effort at laying her soul in view for you to see and there is much to learn from this, both good and bad.<br /><br />First, the most controversial subject, Vietnam and Hanoi Jane.  Fonda gives a detailed description of her side of the Vietnam controversy where she believed fervently the USA was in the wrong.  Clearly, this was a bad war in which we should not have participated.  However, as much as she quotes from the Pentagon Papers and tells of her meetings with soldiers who changed their mind and now understand she position, it still doesn't feel right to me to openly oppose America and cavort with the enemy IN THEIR COUNTRY.  I had no real opinion of her on this issue and took no real offense to her visit.  Now, reading her side of the story, it just doesn't feel right to carry demonstrations to the enemy's country and flaunt your position.  She tries to justify that she wasn't speaking against the soldiers, just the administration.  She tries to build a case that the POWs that said they were tortured due to her visit must be lying because others said they weren't tortured.  Disagreeing with America is an Americans privilege.  Disagreeing while in other countries borders on treason to me.  Even she earlier admitted while in France that it felt inappropriate in a foreign country to demonstrate against her country.<br /><br />But it's not that black and white an issue.  Jane makes very good points of why she disagreed and where all the administrations, Republican and Democrat, lied to the public.  In my life this is the biggest controversy in our country for this generation.  I respect and honor our soldiers.  But I also respect and honor Jane Fonda's right to disagree and protest the war.  But there is a limit to where the damage is too great.  And an apology for sitting on an Anti-aircraft gun doesn't quite cover the damage in my opinion.  You will learn a lot of the specific issues that so inflamed her particularly apparent secret bombing of dikes.  Form your own opinion but don't let this critical part of the book lessen your enjoyment of the whole book.<br /><br />Now, to fascinating book parts that are not as controversial.  She describes the initial idea of the controversial film \\"Coming Home\\", the first major film to deal with Vietnam and the emotional trauma.  Reading the evolution of how the film started and evolved is fascinating and I applaud her and her producing partner Bruce, director Hal Ashby, and fellow actors Jon Voight and Bruce Dern on a cinematic masterpiece.  And specifically, Jane, thanks for the story behind the scenes on how this masterpiece was made.<br /><br />And this applies to \\"On Golden Pond\\" also.  Dare I say maybe the ultimate cinematic accomplishment of our generation?  How many Americans my age watched this movie and cried at the touching human story portrayed by some of the greatest actors ever!  The back story of Katherine Hepburn is nothing short of fascinating as Jane takes us inside what a real actor is like and how Hepburn both helped her and fought her.  This movie is really a synopsis of the relationship of Jane and father Henry's relationship and how wonderful is it to have this raw emotion splayed on the screen!<br /><br />I'm not just a movie lover as I found the history of her marriage to Tom Hayden fascinating.  It just goes to show that what you see in public is not what goes on in all relationships as her \\"storybook\\" marriage disintegrates before her eyes.  Her famous exercise videos are also covered in depth showing how it slowly started, how she hurt relationships to have the business finance her political causes, and the extent to which it becomes enormously profitable.<br /><br />For most of this book we have an extreme left-leaning privileged actress who lives her life in a fascinating manner.  But in her 50s she's hit by a tornado from the south, Ted Turner, a man that clearly would not be considered a feminists first choice.  But this is where the book is even more appealing as this avowed Democrat who admits to not being around religious people unless they were Jewish, suddenly is thrust into a life in the deep South around conservative, Christian people.  Maybe the greatest statement I can make of Jane is that unlike a lot of people, many of who will read this book and dislike it, she learned from these new friends and altered her life completely becoming an advocate concerning teenage pregnancy and a devoutly religious person.  Life is to be learned from and this later chapter of her life shows that she was willing to grow and continue to learn.  I find it fascinating that after living around New York, Los Angeles and France, she has chosen to make Atlanta her home!<br /><br />I've left out so many parts of this book that are enjoyable like parental skills, her childhood and first marriage.  She left out many parts such as any discussion of her romance with Donald Sutherland and I'm sure there are many others.  How many Americans knew that her left-leaning, while learned from her father, were cultivated in the six or so years she lived in France in her 20s?  Or the fascinating story of how the movie \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" is made to demonstrate our society living above its means in the 70s?<br /><br />This is a magnificent book of growing up in the last half of the 20th century.  I applaud Jane for allowing me to learn from her, even when I may strongly disagree with her stands.  Read this book with an open mind and learn about Jane Fonda, American values, and who you are and who you can be.d actress who lives her life in a fascinating manner.

Well, actually written like this one, it works well.  Ian O'Connor spends a year following Sebastian Telfair, the latest Coney Island point guard superstar who just happens to be the cousin of the last great NY point guard superstar, Stephon Marbury, who just happened to be chronicled in \\"Last Shot : City Streets, Basketball Dreams by Darcy Frey.  Where Marbury attended Georgia Tech for a year and was under significant family pressure to earn money, Telfair signed with Louisville but hoped never to attend if the money was there to go pro.  What a change a decade has made from Marbury's matriculation to the pros and Telfair's direct approach through a $15 million Addidas contract.<br /><br />The stereotype is all there of the family living in the projects with numerous males having had legal problems including the father, to the \\"add-on brother\\" who did not make the NBA after a great college career.  I'm reminded of a line from a Jimmy Buffett song, \\"Through the whole thing my new friend stood grinning\\" which pretty much sums up Telfair's demeanor through this season which will determine how rich he can become and how soon.  And it's only his senior year in high school!<br /><br />O'Connor adds exceptional research and really attempts to understand all those close to the decision: father, mother, brother in jail on suspicion of murder, former & jilted AAU coach, current and shady AAU coach and the agents who want to serve Telfair.  O'Connor seems not to have an agenda but just watches and reports as it all unfolds not seeming to take sides or offer moral opinions.  And it works!<br /><br />If you want to learn about the high-stakes world of a basketball prospect teetering between not being drafted and striking it rich, this is the book. There may be many who morally judge high school ballplayers going straight to the pros but I believe if the owners want to pay the money, any young man from a humble background has an obligation to investigate his potential.  This book will appeal to anyone who is a college or pro basketball fan and is concerned with players skipping college.is book will appeal to anyone who is a college or pro basketball fan and is concerned with players skipping college. <br />	2005-04-15

Joe Finder has written an exceptional novel that moves so fast that it's difficult to put down.  If you liked Finder's \\"Paranoia\\", you'll love \\"Company Man\\".  He touches every base with a mystery novel built around business involving a crime, and a love interest and sob story to appeal to the most sensitive female.<br /><br />Company President Nick Conover is a pariah in his home town after massive layoffs.  After repeated harassment to his home decorated by his now deceased wife, a self defense or senseless murder is committed.  But rather than call the police the first call is to his smarmy head of security which leads to a massive cover-up and the thread around which this novel is built.<br /><br />While Conover is dealing with this cover-up he is also trying to save his company from bankruptcy and devious board members, meeting a new love interest and worrying about his teenage son's fall into drugs and poor grades while still paying attention to his younger daughter.  If this character isn't enough we also enjoy the female detective subjected to racism out to crack this crime.<br /><br />This book is fast, furious and interesting.  Character development is excellent.  The ending will surprise and shock you.  This book is destined for Hollywood with the correct screenwriter.  It is an excellent book for businessmen as watching the overlay of the company problems is interesting with many twists.  But this book will also appeal to females interested in following a family recovering from tragedy while finding a new love interest.  And, if you like intrigue, mystery and surprise endings, you've come to the right place.  I couldn't recommend this book higher.	2005-04-06

The basic premise is these guys pushed stocks unmercifully and investors bought all the while the analysts knew that the valuations were inappropriate.  Clearly in retrospect this was true and even at that time anyone who was \\"drinking the Kool-Aid\\" should have seen it.  But the bubble market allowed this phenomenon to continue until the correction was painful.<br /><br />Gasparino does a great job researching and presenting the facts in a straight forward method.  There are plenty of books on this subject but having delayed this book till release of company emails enhanced his proof.  Of particular interest/embarrassment is the pseudo internet affair Jack Grubman has that is exposed in email files now in public records.  While I had followed this in the WSJ I had not read of this email exchange.  Sure glad my wife does not have to read about it in a book.<br /><br />Overall I give this book extremely high marks.  If you are a casual investor this is a must read to understand information used for investing decisions can be tainted.  If you are a sophisticated investor, this will all be old news but still presented in an enjoyable summary that won't bore you with the repeated info.  Anyone who is not an investor but wants to study this period of time or wants to learn about investing can also learn what goes on behind the curtain.  My only complaint would be there is never any discussion of what blame should be placed with investors.	2005-04-05

I decided to take a chance on this book as the basic premise of tossing a beautiful wife overboard seemed to provide interesting possibilities.  Unknown to the husband, she survives with her exceptional swimming skills until she hangs onto a bale of marijuana and is rescued by typical ex-cop Mick Stranahan.  Here is where this book follows the basic Hiaasen formula.  She's beautiful and will eventually fall for the ex-cop, the bad guy will somehow be destroying the ecological system of Florida, and at least one of the bad guys will be so vile that he would qualify as more animal than human.<br /><br />I found this book above the typical Hiaasen fare that made me stop reading his books and many parts are quite funny.  But I wish he would tone the bizarre characters down or change the venue or themes somewhat.  Overall, not a bad read if you need something for a plane ride or day at the beach.	2005-04-05

A young struggling ad exec is approached by a Native American, attractive attorney-to-be with very mysterious questions.  While trying to overcome his attraction to her he learns her secret.  Her heritage and legal background puts her in the unique position of knowing that he may be the rightful heir to all Manhattan.<br /><br />Now, isn't this the type fantasy we would all like to dream about?  Well, except if you are in the title insurance business of course.  The novel becomes a light trip through this fantasy, the past history of Manhattan, and the growing relationship between the two main characters.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable, light read for the beach or a plane trip across country.

Weltlich left to coach Texas in the early 80s.  That move did not go and he eventually left the business moved to a lower tier school until retirement.  Weltlich was an exceptional coach as he proved with below average talent and zero basketball tradition at Ole Miss.  But he's just as well known for his on-court demeanor.  Weltlich is a disciple of Bobby Knight and all that that implies.  Tough, aggressive man to man defense and make sure you don't mind getting yelled at as it's coming loud, hard and often.<br /><br />Weltlich has done a great job of creating a novel about basketball.  He picks a successful referee in the process of having his first child and all the money problems of a struggling young couple.  But this problem can all be solved as another referee explains by assuring the outcome of a few games.  Not in which team wins but in what the \\"point spread\\" is.  It's a perfect fit for this man needing a way to get ahead and before you know it he's up to his neck in the scheme with all the relevant problems you would expect.<br /><br />While I have to compliment Weltlich on his very good plot development for his first novel, I must also mention the biggest drawback.  Weltlich has virtually no writing style.  The book reads like it was written by a freshman entering college.  He tells the story but uses no tricks with words to expand the explanation and generate excitement.  It's a nice story.  But told through the words of a better writer it could have been much better.  The sentences are so simplistic that eventually you're almost reading the book in a scan as it reads so quickly.<br /><br />I have huge respect for anyone who will devote the time necessary to undertake the creation of a novel so it's difficult for me to criticize this undertaking.  Particularly after he did such a great job in creating an interesting story.  Hopefully, Mr. Weltlich will learn from his first experience and have a more seasoned second outing.  If it's a subject that I find of interest, I'd read it to look for the improvement that I'm sure would be there.interesting story.

Dick spends quite a bit of time going through his humble beginnings at the embryonic Espn.  Hard to remember it being a start-up.  Actually he goes back further describing getting fired as a coach and what a mental challenge that was.<br /><br />But this book is all about celebrating college basketball as seen through Dick Vitale's eyes.  Yes, I'm aware he can be \\"over the top\\".  But listening to him describe how much he loves his job and how much he is overpaid gives you an idea of just how much he loves waking up everyday and finding someone new to listen to him.<br /><br />While a substantial amount of the book is about Dick, he also hits the major problems with the game today and what he would do to change them.  Destined to be controversial, Dick Vitale makes an impact in his job and other peoples lives.  Recently I attended a U of Louisville/U of Memphis game and right before the cameras start rolling Dick jumps out on the floor to dance to the band.  I'm sure many people would find this foolish.  But with his bald head and big smile, he brought the crowd to a standing ovation.  He makes you have more fun and that's a great profession to be in.<br /><br />Be forewarned that you can't read this book without the words sounding like their coming from Dick's mouth, similar to listening to the book on tape.  I know that sounds weird but when you read it, you've heard the voice and the themes so many times that it becomes familiar to you.  I've had the pleasure to meet Dick and let me assure you he is EXACTLY in person like you see on TV.  A guy having fun and wanting everyone else to also.	2005-04-04

This is an exceptional book to understand the current-day economics of the movie business which has changed drastically.  Much in this book has already been covered of the original movie business starting from an Eastern Jewish influence to the West Coast.  Fortunate to have a business with complete control of the talent through the studio system it was a \\"win-win\\" controlling the talent as well as what movies were shown in the theaters they owned.  But laws soon outlawed owning the theaters and by the 60s the studio system completely crumbled allowing directors and stars to now bid their pay to incredible wealth.<br /><br />Where this book really excels is not in the history of the business, where a fine job was done, but in the current discussion of the economics of the business.  There are specific examples but probably the most telling is concerning the film, \\"Gone in Sixty Seconds\\", a typical car crash film starring Nicolas Cage.  Most would probably assume this was not a profitable movie but he explains how movies are generally not profitable from ticket sales but through licensed video games, DVD sales and other promotions.  This movie was hugely profitable but only when considering this ancillary income.<br /><br />The example is carried further in explaining the mystic behind \\"net\\" and \\"gross\\" points.  The known fact in Hollywood is always to get your points in \\"gross\\", prior to expense allocation.  That's easier said than done.  He goes through the whole math of the clearing house.  As a former CPA it's an excellent explanation on what is \\"behind the curtain\\" in Hollywood accounting that leads to so many lawsuits.<br /><br />Overall, I consider this on of the best books ever written about Hollywood.  But this reads somewhat like a college textbook full of thought provoking information.  This is not a light, fun read but a business book which should be required reading for anyone considering entering the business side of Hollywood.

But this well researched book traces the tragic story of how Charles Ponzi came to America, what he did before the Ponzi scheme and what happened to him afterwards.  It would make a great movie! Situated in Boston, he ran ads for great returns and when many middle class people invested, publicity soon followed with various members of the media warning that it was a scam.  No common criminal, he took the press on and argued the opposite winning much public support.<br /><br />It is a fascinating tale!  The side story of the faithful wife who only wanted her husband at home without the money and the final outcome of their marriage is also heartwarming and tragic.<br /><br />I like business biographies and this certainly qualifies although I wouldn't consider him the classic success story.  This book offers so much more with detailed history of that time period and the roles regulators, politicians and media played in society at that time.  And the story itself is charming in many ways.  Charles Ponzi was a common man that on the surface became wealthy and everyone rooted for him.  But it only lasted so long.  If you have interest in finance you will like this book.  If you have interest in the history of the early 1900s in this growing country you will be interested.  If you like novels and good character growth I think this will also be of interest as it reads like a novel as he develops his scheme.	2005-04-04

She wrote The Glass Castle, about her life as a very poor Appalachian child whose parents later lived on the streets of NY while she was rising to fame.  Her mother still lives as a squatter.  It is mentioned that she told her story to Kelli Pryor who wrote this novel in 1997 under the name Annie Garrett.  So, this is probably based on a true story.  You may want to research both books as I am doing.	2005-03-22

As this book rightly shows he revolutionized the game of football not only by his fabulous arm but his persona.  Now some may say he was the beginning of the \\"me\\" generation in team sports and all the bad that has come from that.  But I think that's a tad unfair.  Basically this is a story that needs to be told.<br /><br />But this book is not without flaws.  I was glad to read in one place the complete Joe Namath story which contained many stories of which I was not familiar.  But the mistake made by the author after spending so many hours of exhaustive research was to try and include it all.  This book is clearly 50-100 pages too long.  So while I enjoyed this, be prepared for a time commitment to read about a 60-70s icon.  I enjoy learning but did I really want to learn everything about Joe that any source interviewed by the author found?	2005-01-17

If you like football then you will probably love this book.  Lawrence Taylor is arguably the best player in the last 20 years or maybe forever.  He clearly revolutionized his position.<br /><br />This book is probably 30% football, 70% off the field.  And that's as it should be as his world was wild and wooly and makes a great read.  The drugs, the women, the parties are all here.  Some of the most interesting parts are how he hid his drug habits from the NFL.<br /><br />This isn't a classically written book.  But the stories are so compelling it can't help be entertaining.  You'll read it with your mouth open in disbelief.  And, at least for the time being, it ends with a story of redemption.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for football fans and stories of the wild life.	2005-01-17

While I was aware of the significant ruling in the 80s when Georgia and Oklahoma as a test case for the CFA were allowed to televise away from the standard one game a week on ABC, I was not aware that the outcome was more games but significantly lower TV revenue.  This was the most significant development of the past 50 years with the next big move being the bowl tie-ins and increased revenue available from the BCS bowls in the 90s.<br /><br />But what this author did such a good job of was detailing the personalities involved with the NCAA and how that dictated how TV contracts were negotiated up until the 80s.  Some fallout of those relationships is what led to the later mess in TV rights fees.<br /><br />Having worked on a fundraising board with a 1-A College athletic program, this is a must read that I would recommend for any athletic administrator or diehard fan.  I find it interesting that this book has been out three months and it hasn't been reviewed.  I suspect that means that not many college football fans also read books.  Or maybe it means they don't use Amazon.  Irrespective, do yourself a favor and read this book if you enjoy the game of college football.	2004-12-31

But this book tries to mine more of that gold and not quite as well.  The Great Generation told stories by Brokaw.  This book is a sampling of letters written based upon reading the Greatest Generation.  And while many of the letters are touching, it doesn't read as professionally as the first book and in many cases becomes redundant.  A worthwhile read but not nearly as good as the first.	2004-12-25

Since it was a true story I did some internet research and ran into this book written by one of the crew on that voyage.  So I thought I would read it.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't impressed.  It does exactly what it says it will which is give you a general overview of the cruise and what happened on it.  But the most critical event, the tragedy at sea, is covered in just a few pages.  Basically, \\"we got close to a storm and the next thing you know, we sank.\\"  Now, obviously I'm generalizing.  But that's how it felt.  And previous to that, there is really nothing compelling to report.  There are mentions of a diversity of age of students and maybe that was a mistake as they had to let some immature passengers off early.  Also, I was disappointed that there wasn't a more significant update of the remainder of the captain's life.  Overall, I thought the movie was fine but this book was not worth the read.  You be the judge.	2004-12-03

From there I read many of his early books and read many later books up until the last three years.  Having spent so much time reading his different writings including one of his early novels of sailing, I thought it would be worthwhile to read his first book.  Blue Water is about Stuart Woods' love of sailing and his adventure in participating in a transatlantic race solo.  While this book shows signs of an inexperienced writer, inordinate details that do nothing to move the book along, it does provide a great framework of what is involved in undertaking such a challenging race including the dangers at sea which become quite clear in the last 8th of the book.  In addition, if you have studied Woods' other books you get a look at his early life and how those influences may have affected his writings.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Stuart Woods' novels, this is a worthwhile read.  If you are a fan of the sea and sailing, you'll also enjoy this book.  Other than that, I wouldn't take the time to find this book and pay the high price necessary since it is so far out of print and sells at a high level.	2004-12-03

Phil Jackson basically kept a diary of last year and his feelings of the players and how he molds his teams.  Now, I'm sure the plan was to have the book close with a World Championship.  But instead he got a dysfunctional family with a key member under felony indictment, two new family members who struggle to adapt, and a disappointing finish.<br /><br />Admittedly, in some parts your thinking that you shouldn't be reading this as he pulls no punches on his personal feelings about players and management.  But if you are a Laker fan it makes for a fascinating read.  And if you are a basketball aficionado, you are subjected in small doses to basketball theory and how Jackson applied them in his job.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book.  However, I suspect after the initial publicity this book will not have great legs.  I came away with an improved image of Shaq and Karl Malone (if it's possible to think higher of a great warrior) and curiosity on how Kobe's relationships with Shaq and Phil can be so strained.  A quick read, I strongly recommend you make your own judgment if you have strong interest in basketball or the Lakers.	2004-12-03

I did not find that to be the case at all.  Yes, he did give tennis stories and then close with how that story might apply in other's business life.  But what I found in this book is an inside look at a talented coach and his relationship with his player.  And given that his players were Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick, it's an interesting story for tennis fans.  I've never been a big Andre Agassi fan having watched him tank matches at the tournament at my club as well as some of his early antics.  And could we please get the announcers to quit talking about him running up a hill as a statement of his great fitness.  However, I do have a great appreciation for his talent.  From reading this book I have a greater appreciation of Andre the man.  He's grown from an undisciplined talent who was lucky to be in the right place with the right talent to an intelligent quality individual.  And in some respects you have to give Brad some credit although Gilbert is not attempting to take any.<br /><br />Although over 1/2 the book seems to mention Andre, there is quite a bit about Andy.  It is interesting to hear him compare their different approaches to tennis and life in general.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book for any tennis fan.  I do not think you will be disappointed.  Another must read from Brad Gilbert.	2004-12-03

What I learned (but already knew) was the history of the tech stock craze in the later 90s.  But Kessler also frames this around the Industrial Revolution and the development of the steam engine.  That may be the one weakness in the book as an inordinate amount of time is spent on this analogy.  It works but takes a while to get there.<br /><br />While he doesn't go in to great depth of the investing strategy, he does go through the general philosophies of what they were looking for and examples when they were successful.  And he does it in an entertaining style.<br /><br />What does come through is the unique partnership he had with Fred and how it worked.  Particularly at the end when they recognized the money and market were just too hot and they needed to pull back.  That sounds easy in hindsight but anyone who was investing or managing money at that time will tell you how difficult it is to turn investors off after the great difficulty in getting their money.<br /><br />Where this book really shines is pure entertainment.  With the exception of the steam engine analogy, this is a fast entertaining read written in a very witty style.  Kessler is a gifted writer and I wouldn't be surprised to see him move to novels eventually.  This book is like a perfect college class: you get entertained but learn something also.  I strongly recommend this book to investors or anyone with interest in the history of technology companies.	2004-12-02

As a big tennis fan I had previously read Johnny Mac's book with minor digs at Tatum but mostly explanations of why he is always right.  This book gives Tatum's side of the story.  And it's not pretty!  But it is entertaining!<br /><br />Remembered as the youngest Oscar winner, Tatum's lasting legacy besides her kids will be surviving the most dysfunctional family I have ever heard, or read about.  After living some years with an alcoholic, prescription drug addicted mother, Tatum, and eventually brother Griffin, are shipped to wealthy, movie star father, Ryan O'Neal.  Wow!!!  What a nut this guy is!  Always in competition with his daughter as an actor, and his son as a physical competitor, Ryan has no ability to raise kids.  Need evidence?  Well, Griffin has been involved in the death of a friend and multiple drug problems. Tatum admits to heroin and cocaine additions in addition to child molestations and a promiscuous lifestyle as a young star.  And now, his last child with Farrah Fawcett, Redmond, has already been through drug rehab.  At some point even a village idiot could see a problem here.<br /><br />As an aside, it's very disappointing to seeing one of my favorite stars, Farrah Fawcett, drug in to this.  Other than having a rocky relationship with Farrah, Tatum doesn't throw dirt on this strange  relationship but just living in this environment made this classic American beauty from Texas the scared, fragmented women seen on Dave Letterman a few years ago.  Not to mention a teenage son with drug problems.  Very sad.<br /><br />Tatum gives you the full story.  The warts of the relationship with her father, the true story of her marriage to John McEnroe, and finally her serious drug problems after her divorce from John.  Obviously, Tatum tells her story from her perspective.  But even through that prism you can see that this was a uniquely bizarre life which I found very believable.  This book will appeal to anyone interested in life in Hollywood.  Tennis fans may not like this as much as it's so a small part of the book.  I strongly recommend this book written by a very interesting woman.nnis fans may not like this as much as it's so a small part of the book.

This book does a great job discussing what the program has accomplished in the past 25 years which is nothing short of a miracle.  Most programs now are built by spending the most money and having the most fans which generally will be large state schools with some holdovers from previous eras. USC and ND come to mind.  But the Caines secret is the local athletes that have attended and done well and continue to come and give back.  Being actively involved in a D1A program I can tell you this is nothing short of a huge accomplishment.  Hearing the stories of FAMOUS players coming back to mentor current athletes is inspiring.<br /><br />Now of course there has been a history of coaches to be chronicled and some of the first really set the tone for the program, Howard Schnellenberger and Jimmy Johnson come to mind.  While all the coaches have been successful, many were never comfortable coaching this program under the pressure of previous athletes and local rap stars.  But the program has survived and remains an \\"in your face\\" program that you either like or hate.  To me, it's all about the athletes and what they inspire.  Older people are generally not going to like the aggressive style.  Me, I enjoy watching them do it the Caine way.	2004-10-31

I read the Sports Illustrated article about the book right before the movie came out.  Then I saw the movie even though reviews said it was mediocre and the book was better.  My experience was different and I wish I had read the book first.  I enjoyed the movie and found it to be almost exactly like the book making the book almost not worth rereading as there was no new information. Yes, they changed a few things like the championship game was really the semi-final game, but generally I found it to be very true to the book.<br /><br />The story is what makes the book and the author should be commended for spending a year of his life following this high school football team.  But the book is more than just football.  It's about lives and dreams of young people and the economic survival of a town and how it entertains itself exclusively with MOJO football.<br /><br />The individual stories of the 5 key players are exceptionally done as all have a unique story to tell straight out of casting central.  I strongly recommend this book as a great way to spend a weekend following a story of a town following a legendary football team.	2004-10-31

Like Connors, Drucker grew up in St. Louis and later Los Angeles with an interest in tennis that later allowed him to cross paths with Jimmy Connors, his tennis hero.  But it was not always that way as Drucker chronicles his love for the stated elegance of the game and his dissatisfaction with the new \\"ugly\\" heroes, Connors, Nastase and McEnroe.<br /><br />Slowly the Connors mystique captures Drucker and he elegantly writes of his love of tennis while at the same time discussing the struggles of his older brother who suffers from mental illness.  The overlay of his personal story only takes about 1/4 of the book with the remainder covering Connors who is a unique human being blessed to be fueled by the overwhelming desire to compete against the world.  But this competitive fire has its downside as Connors never really lets anyone close and competes on the tour as a loner while most other competitors socialize and enjoy each other's company.<br /><br />So with this background, Drucker reconstructs the meteoric rise of Connors' career through his eventual drop below Borg and McEnroe while he leaves his high school tennis career, attends Cal Berkeley and starts a failed career as a tennis journalist.  From here he's able to spend time with Connors and get drawn in to the very small inner circle. Drucker floats the idea of a biography which Connors always seems interested in but in the end, Connors remains the loner who is, not letting anyone get close enough to really know him.  Connors is a warrior.  He has the heart of a lion even though his ability to interact with other humans may not be as advanced as most people would like.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enlightening, well-written book.  I recommend this book for anyone with an interest in tennis or the history of tennis as well as those interested in inter-personal relationships.  I suspect we'll see other books from Drucker as he is an excellent writer.e other books from Drucker as he is an excellent writer. <br />	2004-10-31

Based on a series of articles Branston has written in various magazine/paper assignments, this book segments into different areas of interest.  Leading with politicians and gamblers, the most fascinating chapters concern the development of Tunica, Mississippi as a major gambling center while 30 miles north Memphis missed the opportunity. Chapters on interstate development and other civic projects give the reader a good background in significant developments that have shaped this city for better or worse.<br /><br />But to me the best section is the last titled Souvenirs of a Journalist, particularly the chapters on Fred Smith of Fedex, Bill Tanner, self-made millionaire and convicted felon and a fascinating chapter on working in the Distribution center of America as a product packer.  The Distribution chapter was researched by two weeks of holding various jobs to understand what drives the Memphis economy.  A very interesting article!<br /><br />The initial politician chapters provide good framework but are somewhat mundane.  By the end of the book, each chapter is building a new fascinating story and you actually hate to finish as the stories are so interesting. Let's hope this book is the start of a new career for Branston moving from magazine to books.  I strongly recommend this book for those with any interest in Memphis.	2004-10-18

But that is not the overall theme of this book.  Mike is an interesting story in and of himself.  Most people know the short biography, emigrates from Iran after being an Olympic boxer, works at a Las Vegas casino, and becomes a typical stressful tennis Dad who raises a world champion.  This book takes that sketch and fills in the blanks starting with the massive change in lifestyles from Iran to America as well as a touch into the political environment of Iran.  After a very successful marriage while in Chicago, Mike moves his young family to the new frontier in Las Vegas.  Mike makes no excuses for the tyrannical tennis coaching of his four kids that he acknowledges alienated two of his kids, particularly Rita to whom he did not talk to for years.<br /><br />Eventually the book does drift to Andre and his relationship with Nick Bolliteri, his career and his two marriages.  But more than anything this book is about an American family headed by a driven immigrant from Iran and how it puts itself back together after volatile relationships caused by his tennis obsession.  After following Agassi's career somewhat put off by his early grandstanding, I must admit, this book does give me far greater appreciation for the struggles in his life.  If you're a tennis fan, I strongly recommend this book.	2004-10-18

While I enjoyed watching McEnroe and enjoy his broadcasting ability, I can't say I'm much of a fan of his outsized ego.  You'd think this book would therefore be much to my liking.  Unfortunately, I only found this book mildly entertaining.  There are a lot of subjects I liked but nothing that makes this a compelling exciting read for the average fan.  Tennis aficionados may still want to read however.<br /><br />After a brief background Scanlon supports his book title by attempting to hook the reader by blasting McEnroe's gamesmanship in their matches.  But unlike Brad Gilbert's book with quality matches against McEnroe and Becker, Scanlon's case is weak as he RARELY beat McEnroe.  It almost projects an image of envy spending so much time commenting on McEnroe and frankly, using it in the title to sell the book.  Well, it worked in getting my money.  OK, McEnroe's an @ss.  Now let's move on.  But he keeps coming back to it to where eventually it's pitiful.<br /><br />The book really isn't about Mac other than in a tabloid manner.  That's just an excuse to write a memoir about tennis in its greatest era. There is a very good chapter on the evolution of racquets and how that unnerved players who began with wooden racquets.  Also, a chapter on fitness focusing on Navratilova and Lendl are quite interesting as well as a chapter on coaching and the evolution of the tennis entourage.  But another dear subject to Scanlon which tends to lose the reader is the evolution of the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals).  Substantial time is spent here with a chapter on the controversial head Hamilton Jordan.  Then we have a complete retelling of the battle inside the tennis establishment.  This will be interesting only to people with interest in the business side of tennis.<br /><br />Would I read this book again?  Yes, but I love to read and love tennis.  For the casual fan, I couldn't recommend this book.  It covers subjects of interest to Scanlon but not in my opinion in a cohesive manner to entertain a casual fan.  And, at the end of the day, I found the constant whining about the whiner McEnroe to be beneath the type book Scanlon was trying to write.ook.

If you read books to be entertained then I recommend this book.  If you have a religious or conservative agenda, you're not likely to like this book.  Therefore, you have a disparity of opinion in reviews.  I do not watch porn movies and have only seen her on Howard Stern or E! TV.  Sometimes she is attractive and sometimes I find her to be overrated.  But she projects a friendly, engaging personality that I think draws people to her.<br /><br />This is an autobiography which may confuse some people by the title.  But there are touches of \\"How to Make Love Like at Porn Star\\".  Specifically, the testimonial from the unidentified male porn star.  Not a picture of a glamorous life but well worth the read.<br /><br />But in the end this is an autobiography of a young girl who gets in with the wrong crowd and by 16 she is stripping and living with a much older tattoo artist with a serious meth addiction.  Jenna is good at her craft and quickly moves from dancer to model to porn performer and along the way develops relationship and drug problems.  For people who do not like strippers/porn stars, you'll see all the stereotypes that you expect.<br /><br />It's interesting to hear her tell her story with her point of view.  Is she always right?  Of course not.  Can she be a very tough witch that you wouldn't want to be around?  Absolutely.  But at the end of the day, she's developed a great career in her chosen field and is making a lot of money.  AND, she's written a very entertaining book.	2004-09-14

As most American males I've always had some interest in Playboy Playmates so I thought this might be an interesting read.  What was interesting was hearing of Hef's Wednesday/Friday orgies that end up with multiple girls and him.  Nice life Hef. Unfortunately, the author, who begged to live the Playboy lifestyle and pursued a photo shoot layout and invitation to the mansion, suddenly gets morals and is shocked and appalled by what she discovers.  What was she thinking?  Her only point is she thought Hef was so old (and physically gross) she couldn't believe the girls actually had to sexually perform with him.  DID SHE ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING OF HIS LIFESTYLE?<br /><br />So if you want to know what goes on with Hef and his girlfriends, it's here.  Unfortunately, everything else in this book is pathetic.  She's 30 but continues to tell us how beautiful she is as she aggressively pursues her dream with boyfriend in tow.  What a klutz he must be to fall for this!  Then when she somewhat achieves her dream, she's shocked by the degradation and jealousy among the girls.  Come on!  When you're living with a guy with lots of money and multiple girlfriends there is destined to be jealousy amongst the girls.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very bad book written by someone who wants her 15 minutes in the spotlight.  There is not enough material for a book and the writer clearly is in love with herself which comes off pathetic in the book.  If you want to see what Hef's up to maybe you'll like the book.  Other than that the only positive comment I can relay is that it is a short book.	2004-09-14
US	52444905	R2C6MI31P6GR5G	0743493729	464909547	Star: A Novel	Books	2	24	28	N	Y	The Ultimate Tease	I purchased this after seeing some favorable comments and knowing that it was a thinly veiled story of her life.  And for the first few chapters it does have promise as this pretty, unworldly girl gets exposed to a life of which she never dreamed.  But Pam is more than beautiful although she needs to drop most of the makeup and return to her original \\"girl next door\\" look.  She has an engaging personality that comes across on screen and on guest spots such as Howard Stern.  Her appeal is very \\"Marilyn Monroe-esque\\":  Beauty, lust and cute charm when she opens her mouth.<br /><br />But that only goes so far as everyone she meets in LA loves her, wants to help her, and also wants to sleep with her.  And right when the book should be the most exciting, it becomes too repetitive.  She goes from the small town girl you root for to the, well, the Pam Anderson caricature of herself that she currently is.<br /><br />Did I like some parts of this book?  Yes.  But they are few and far between as the book goes on and I was happy to finish the book.  Forget the hype.  Don't read this book unless you have a specific interest in Pam Anderson.  I agree with other reviewers.  If you're going to write an autobiography, just right it.	2004-09-14

But she does add a few beauty secrets and coming from someone who should know, those should be taken to heart.<br /><br />But in the end it's a book of nothing. It appears she made money on her first book and now wanted to revisit the ATM machine. But you've got to offer a compelling story. The first one is. This one isn't. I'd take a pass on this one.

A beginning nanny from small-time Oregon ends up as a nanny for Steve Swartz (probably Mike Ovitz), Rhea Pearlman and Debra Winger. Most people will focus on how the stars live and the difference between the powerful agent and the wonderful, friendly stars (Sally Field also mentioned in glowing terms). But this is also a tale of a young girl growing up in a unique environment.<br /><br /> While the nanny has many complaints, it can't be good news for a couple to ask for a two year commitment and then have the nanny abruptly announce she is leaving (but she still wants to be able to see the kids). So in many ways, the back-story is as interesting as the &quot;nanny to the stars&quot; tale.<br /><br /> I read this book not knowing who the agent Schwartz was but surprised I had never heard of him given the power described in this book. Readers on here say it is Ovitz which is entirely believable based upon the description of his habits, friends and work description. Evidently I missed the part where it referenced using alias names. And you get to see the famous Ovitz at work when he attempts to &quot;sell&quot; the Nanny on staying and is unsuccessful. Just ask the writer Joe Esterhas how that works.<br /><br /> Overall I REALLY enjoyed this read. Yes, I know I'm a male and enjoy sports books but this told a great entertaining story of seeing the world through the eyes of a very high-income family as told from someone who had no idea lives like this existed. This book will appeal to anyone who likes stories of Hollywood or family life.	2004-08-02
US	52444905	R22EHXGFSZ5PVI	0898869595	936059683	The Naked Mountain	Books	4	9	10	N	Y	The Rest of the Story	This is a much awaited book as Messner tells his side of what happened on the Nanga Parbut expedition that killed his brother in 1970.  The book mentioned that as a condition for the tour, climbers were required to sign Confidentiality Documents that they would not discuss the climb keeping the expedition organizer from being subject to criticism.  This gentleman was mountain obsessed as his half brother had died on the mountain years earlier.  He also was not a climber which set him up for criticism as the real climbers downgraded the organization work necessary to mount this expedition.  He has since passed on which I suspect is one reason the book has now been written.<br /><br />One must remember that this is a biased report by Messner but I don't think unbelievable.  He gives him and his brother credit for the massive hauling and camp building only to be told at summit strategy that he is on the assault team but his beloved brother is not.<br /><br />What happens next as he attempts to summit and surprisingly is followed by a late attempt by his brother is controversial, dangerous and makes for exceptional reading.  From Messner's standpoint without a rescue crew coming they descend down the backside of the mountain as it is their only option with limited equipment but creates another set of problems.  An interesting section of the book is after Messner descends but must communicate with villagers as he is near death.<br /><br />Overall, I would encourage anyone to read this book that likes mountaineering stories.  It's written by a controversial, master climber.  The book also is littered with pictures of the mountain which are quite striking.	2004-07-23

But, it is a surface book that does not go deeply into any issues.  You learn that he was Ernie Davis' roommate and the trauma of watching him die.  70% of the book concerns his pro career.  But probably the most controversial section is about his negotiating as the President of the Players Union.  Some of the tricks the owners pulled were amazing and evidently Mackey did a great job slowing their process.<br /><br />Overall this is a good story of a very good man.  And while it mentions all family members in a positive way, the book really doesn't delve deeply into the mind of Mackey.  It's a great, short read if you like him as a football player and that was enough for me.	2004-07-23

Talbott does a good job presenting his case that there is a relationship between household income and housing prices.  His point is well taken that low interest rates have fueled this boom and that when rates rise, housing prices will have to come down.  So, from the perspective of his thesis, I found this to be well written and well documented even if I agree there is a risk but do not believe that it will be significant.<br /><br />For example, he quotes the very low average household net worth?s of households.  Households 45 to 54 have less than $200,000 mean net worth.  But when median net worth is taken into account for the same group, the number is closer to $700,000.  Doesn't this support current home prices while at the same time highlighting a bigger issue, the widening diversity of haves and have-nots in America?  Also, San Diego is presented as the least affordable housing, $379,000 average home vs. $60,000 average income.  That's a great fact but does it take into account the large military population that is generally lowly paid but highly transient that may be more renter than buyer in that area?  I theorize that these many people are lowering average household income while substantially not trying to purchase homes.<br /><br />This is a complex issue I have purchased mortgages and real estate around America through the Texas, East Coast and California busts.  It is worthwhile to discuss that that risk is higher now than in the past 14 years.  But I'm not convinced I see the current catalyst for a bust.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE:  I spoke recently at a banking conference on the likelihood of a home pricing crash.  The speech was well received and there are many that worry of this issue.  I quoted Talbott and gave him credit for his opinion.  He provided great insight and material for a contrarian view on home prices.view on home prices. <br />	2004-07-23

I believe little information should be taken at face value unless it is well documented.  Therefore, I have a horrible reputation as a contrarian who requires people to think and document when presenting me with an opinion.  Obviously, in our current political environment where people are so mentally distressed that they can't bother to understand the other side of an issue, it's an interesting period.<br /><br />I had hoped to read this book to better understand my contrarian leanings or at a minimum to learn something of significance.  Unfortunately, I did not.  I did not find the book enjoyable at all.  I found the author to be quite bombastic and quite the name dropper.  Frequent anecdotes of past history are somewhat meaningful to frame how an unpopular thought process eventually changed political thinking but there are no current event anecdotes of significance.<br /><br />I care to form no opinion positive or negative about Hitchens.  Unfortunately, his writing just did not move me and maybe that's my fault.	2004-07-23

His research is very compelling as he provides statistics on the number of players in his sample who have been accused of crime.<br /><br />But I do have mixed emotion about this book.  The biggest flaw is after stating his thesis, he then gives examples.  These are graphic and what grab the reader.  But, in my opinion, he spends an exorbitant amount of time on a few examples.  So, instead of focusing on a well-researched subject, he relies on a few examples.  Now these examples are horrible.  Specifically Rueben Patterson.  You become more and more amazed at the stupidity and sense of entitlement of some of these athletes.  It is appalling!<br /><br />My second gripe with this book is the story of the Iowa State freshman basketball player who commits armed robbery but is found not guilty, per the book, primarily due to the testimony of his coach, Johnny Orr.  This is another detailed history which makes for interesting reading.  But virtually all of it concerns an athlete with problems in college.  This player's stay in the NBA was very short and not crime related.  Benedict has plenty to prove his point.  But I was very unimpressed with the stories he chose.  Was it because these stories are the most entertaining to tell even if they only narrowly touch NBA players?<br /><br />Overall, I am glad I read this book.  It contains great information and interesting, though disturbing stories.  But I find it a little distressing on the thesis/proof connection.  And it's also damning to the many good players/citizens who are painted with this broad brush.  But if you are a female and want to be around NBA players, you need to understand what you may be dealing with.	2004-07-23

Of course I rolled my eyes and didn't understand.  But when I read this book, I understood why she was so engrossed in the story.<br /><br />This is a book of Nicholas Sparks, the author, going on an around the world historical tour with his brother.  Frankly, I scanned the 1/4 of the book concerning the trip which is intertwined throughout the story.  What is really revealing is the retelling of his dysfunctional family (aren't we all) and the unique relationship he had with his brother.  This trip allows him to recapture and revisit their upbringing, all the fond memories and all the warts, as he completely retells the significant events in the lives of the family members.  The last 50 pages will have you in an emotional upheaval as they deal with many hardships.<br /><br />In many respects this book reminded me of my upbringing and brought back many fond memories.  While many people may find the book overly sentimental, including me as my wife read it, it is extremely touching and you would have to be pretty hard-hearted not to be touched and enjoy the story.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to rate this 5 stars since I openly admit that I scanned 1/4 of the book.  But I really got what I wanted which is an excellent, touching read of growing up in a common American family where everyone strives to overcome their insecurities.  I strongly recommend this book, particularly for females, but also for males like me who typically read business and sports books.  It was quite enjoyable.	2004-07-22

A fantastic book about an interesting character that has little to do with sports and more to do with the human spirit.  This book details Lance's early life as he addresses his cocky, immature nature that quickly goes out the window when he begins his cancer battle.  Lance is alive because his is famous.  His cancer was so aggressive and mature that IMO what saved him is the unsolicited email from the doctor at Vanderbilt that eventually led him to the doctors at Indiana University. I like sports and would never have read a book just about cancer survival but this book was so highly recommended and for good reason.<br />The book finishes with Lance mentally battling to get back on the bike and on to greater glory.  There is much to learn here also but the one downer would be listening to him describing his ideal marriage when of course it has already broken up.<br />I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK HIGHER. You will not be disappointed.  And yes, you will start following the Tour de France.	2004-07-15

Having read the extremely enjoyable Bringing Down the House, I felt I owed it to read this author's second on a subject of which I have interest, investment banking.  This book tells a great story of a Princeton football player from a middle class background who plays in an All-Star game in Japan, meets his future employer there and decides to move back for the opportunity to learn investment banking and trading.<br />This brings up the first problem I have with this book.  Real names are not used but couldn't someone with an extra 30 minutes find an Ivy League football player who works in Japan and currently is working in the Bermudas?  So many parts seemed to be made up.  A fellow trader buys cheap foreclosed real estate and now the author is supposedly being run off the road as a warning by the Japanese mafia?  Come on!<br />But even with the Unbelievability Factor, this is an entertaining book.  It also provides a glimpse into Japanese culture and their view of foreigners.  There is significant mention of the thriving sex trade in Japan of which I was not familiar.  But while it provides a backdrop, the author does not delve in the subject to sell the book.<br />Do I believe this book is 95% factual?  No.  Was I completely entertained?  Absolutely!  So enjoy the story and believe what you will.  Now, if you only read nonfiction, maybe this isn't the book for you.	2004-06-24

I found his second novel to be even better!  Once again, built around a securities firm but this time the protagonist is a research analyst with many past wounds both personally and professionally.  A series of deaths and corporate events throw the analyst accidentally in the mix of solving a major crime before he even knows he's involved in solving the crime.  A love interest and helpful policeman are also introduced to help move the story and add to the many subplots.<br />What I really like about this novel is how he builds short chapters around action events.  In this book you're solving a small problem or ducking another accident every chapter so the book really moves quickly and is very difficult to put down.  Morris also did a good job of hiding the many twists in the whodunit so you won't know exactly who the bad guys are until very close to the end.  And, as mentioned by other reviewers, you will learn about the securities industry as he overlays the crimes around the lives at a securities firm.<br />One other note of interest, he does a great job of interlaying known locations into his novel so if you are familiar with the area of San Diego/La Jolla/Del Mar, you'll be familiar with the action.  In summary, if you like fast mystery/murder novels, you'll love this book.  I'll be back for the next one as soon as it's on sale.  I strongly recommend this book.	2004-06-17

The author, Julie Salamon, was given the opportunity to follow Brian De Palma for the total duration of a very difficult film project, Bonfire of the Vanities, the remake of the famous Tom Wolfe novel.  It is an exceptional replay of everything that happened from original purchase of the rights to the novel, to the publicity and reviews of the famous movie, to the ultimate collapse at the box office.  One only wonders how this book would have read had the movie been a success.<br />While I really enjoyed this book, I would not recommend this book to anyone that does not have an intense interest in Hollywood and the making of movies.  Excessive time is spent poring over the roles of line producers, second unit directors and production assistants.  The book gives you a great understanding not just of the stars but also what it takes to break into the business and what the career path can be.  Particularly as it relates to De Palma's assistant looking for an assistant producer credit and the second unit director looking to break out and become a director of his own films.  In addition, it does touch on the stars, both actors and director, and how their idiosyncrasies shape the movie and its making.<br />This is not a short book.  So if you are looking for an exciting page turner, this is not for you.  You will spend many pages following the tale of obtaining rights to shoot at certain locations, tales of screen tests of local judges, and boycotts and publicity by Bronx politicians.<br />Overall, this controversial book detailing separation of the haves and have-nots of the 80s becomes an even more controversial movie with screw-ups in producing of the movie and casting of the roles.  But if you want to know what Hollywood is really like and not what just is on the screen, this is the book.  You will learn why making movies is so personality driven.  For the movie fans, Tom Hanks comes off as the incredible good guy he appears to be.  Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis are not so lucky.  But maybe the most interesting personal portrayal is of De Palma.  A creature of the 70's decade of the auteur, his portrayal is of a troubled genius that struggles with communication skills.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you have a detailed interest in the business of film.  If not, take a pass as it will be too detailed.s off as the incredible good guy he appears to be.  Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis are not so lucky.

But this is barely a novel.  It has no real conflict or twists.  Basically, you have a stockbroker or money manager who invents a story of a guy suddenly left with $1 million but receives another $5 million if he can get a 15% return over three years.  That's the only excitement.  The rest is repeatedly restating his strategy.  The protagonist starts as a 4th year Stanford student but goes to work for his money manager.  But the whole time he works for the money manager, there is no conflict.  He takes a couple of trips and repeats his &quot;strategy&quot;.<br />Now to the credibility issue. This guy proclaims growth stock picking with his &quot;strategy&quot;.  I have no problem with that.  But when he takes one dig @ value investors, now I have a problem.  I guess Warren Buffett's money is all hype.<br />Look, if you want to learn about investing from a beginners level, this may be a book for you.  He weaves the beginning investor's decisions and discussions in the first part of the novel.  But if there is any other purpose for reading this book, such as enjoyment or a higher level of learning, avoid this book.  BTW, when I went back and read the Editorial reviews, they were from the publisher, from the author, and from the inside cover.  Next time, I'll research my book better and see if anyone of relevance is reviewing the book.	2004-05-24

The protagonist, writer Henry Wearie, has had minor success but is in a bad trough, both writing and personally.  Through reattachment to a former relationship, Henry becomes &quot;hot&quot; or at least &quot;lukewarm&quot; again.  The book proceeds to intertwine stories of Henry as it effects his writing, his friends and his love life as he plods his way through the Industry.<br />My one complaint about the book is through the use of flashbacks the book can be confusing as to where you are in time from where the novel starts.  This book is funny and sad.  If you like to feel emotion in a novel, this will fill the bill.  My only mild complaints would be that there are so many characters introduced for short interludes it's difficult to get extremely attached to the characters and the aforementioned confusion about time structure.	2004-05-07

I didn't find it to be a fast, compelling story of a dangerous jewel thief.  Rather, I found it to be a tale of a common thief with a substantial amount of time spent on normal legal proceedings and life as a fugitive.  While his life was much more normal than you may expect by reading the title, I still found it to be a very compelling read.<br />Mason starts the book as a teenager who has some minor run-ins with the law while living in Cleveland Ohio.  He stumbles in to a life as a jewel thief while marrying, raising kids, and living a fairly normal life as an apartment manager.<br />The book really revs up with a move to South Florida in the 70s.  Florida was exploding with drugs, crime, and wealthy northeners living in ocean front condos with expensive jewels.  Mason describes some of his successful heists but the more interesting story is his relationship with the police.  Also, there is a comical sideline of him buying a small ocean front home to rent where the renters continually turn out to be drug runners using his house as a delivery point.<br />The last part of the book has little to do with jewel thefts and more to do with family and escaping the law.  Overall, I found this to be a worthwhile story to read.  But &quot;a master jewel thief&quot; is really only about 40% of the story.  That may be enough for most readers as it was for me.	2004-05-07

But about 60 pages in this I had to put it down and move to another book.  This is not a light novel to read at the beach without full attention.  Each sentence is written in complex structure like reading a college textbook.  That's OK if there is enjoyment.  But 60 pages in I couldn't find the entertainment or characters to attach to.  It's rare I can't finish a book.  Check my 250 reviews and you'll see it's only happened one other time.  And I'm not a skimmer.  I read completely what I write about.

Always around fascinating personalities from the 50s to 2001, Dick Schaap had the reputation as quite the name dropper.  And he acknowledges this participating in the joke early on.  This book is an accumulation of anecdotes from his life.  His early life and how he gravitates to sports journalism is quite interesting with many great stories of the writers he worked with like Jimmy Breslin and Thomas Wolfe.  Then, he spends some time on well-known sports personalities.  This was the weakest part of the book for me as he retells stories that further the reputation of already known figures.  But the last third of the book turns into classic Dick Schaap with story after story written with his dry wit.  I would strongly recommend this book if you have interest in sports or pop culture from the 60s on.	2004-05-07

I'm the guy in the middle that the candidates are really after.  I say that as any review on this book should be tempered by the politics of the reader.  JE is an avowed Democrat with socialist leanings.  Read his most recent book \\"American Animal\\" to verify this.  So it was surprising as I read the first third of this book that after an initial bow to Clinton as the Rock &amp; Roll Prez, one of &quot;us&quot;, he then seems to chastise him for his fatal flaws.  This part of the book is interesting, engaging, but also somewhat repetitive.  I still couldn't wait to read it my allotted hour a night.<br />But there is only so much you can talk about this subject and JE rambles on and on until he finally manages to really offend me.  How?  Well, I just finished his most recent book, &quot;American Animal&quot; an autobiography which I immensely enjoyed.  Full of Hollywood stories.  But reading this, I see that JE has included many of the stories I enjoyed from his autobiography in this political commentary/fantasy.  So is he a writer with a message or is he just repeating his few stories to make a buck?<br />I don't know what to make of this book, thus my title.  Did I enjoy some parts?  Yes.  Are there some interesting stories?  Yes.  But there is a lot of waste.  It's like wandering thru a jungle with a machete looking for your trail.  When you find it, it's worth the work.  So maybe the only item I can add of interest came from reading this with some years of aging.  JE takes on Arianna Huffington who he spends quite a bit of time describing her history to show what a bad person she is and how she climbed to the top while stepping on other people's faces.  But would JE have included these chapters in this form if he had known that within a few years she would shift sides and now disavow her right wing leanings?  I think not.<br />This is not a great book.  But if you enjoy reading, maybe you will enjoy it.ding, maybe you will enjoy it.	2004-04-02

As mentioned above, this is a book about two twin brothers who are writers on the fringes of Hollywood. The book is really about living in LA on the fringe of show business.  The Mother, Father and two brothers all grew up in the valley, considered the less desireable part of LA (although I assure you there are much worse places).  The author does a great job of developing characters in this zany family and bringing out the humor in growing up in the Valley.<br />But what I didn't like about the book was the weak plot.  There is just no central plot.  Just ramblings of stories of working in Hollywood and trying to become a writer, as well as the hazards of dating in Hollywood.  All with the backdrop of Upper Los Angeles inhabited by wealthy Hollywood players.<br />While I wasn't impressed with the plot, I was very impressed with Randall's ability to make you laugh at the absurd lives of Hollywood wannabes.  This book will be of interest to people that enjoy stories of living in LA written in a dry humor style.	2004-04-01

Unfortunately, I left disappointed.  This is another book of a common man who may not have realized his worth to the world.  And while I agree with this tenet, I don't think his particular telling of the story was as touching as I had hoped.  Please keep in mind, my expectations were extremely high from Tuesdays with Morrie.<br />In fact, it seemed like the esteemed sportswriter had discovered his &quot;formula&quot; book to now turn out for the dollars he may not be making in the sports world.  Sorry to be such a cynic.  I did casually enjoy the book but not nearly as touched as my wife.	2004-04-01

What this book does a great job of is a summation of the market from the 70s forward.  It could be a great additional reading book in a college finance class as you will learn quite of what to do and not do.<br />But where the book may have missed its mark is there is no new ground covered.  &quot;When Genius Failed&quot; covered a very intricate subject and went in to great depth to explain.  The multitude of subjects did not give Lowenstein that option for this book so it reads similar to long newspaper exposes with some additional commentary.<br />Overall I enjoyed this book and recommend it.  But please make sure it matches what you are looking for.  A good history summation is what you have.	2004-04-01

They're just not my cup of tea and I find legal thrillers boring.  But since I have played many sports and am of an age when reflection becomes more important, I decided to read this book based upon personal recommendations and the limited time requirement.<br />Scanning the reviews here, most seem to not like the book.  And much of their criticism seems warranted.  Yes, Neely is a stiff character who speaks in halting sentences and really doesn't say much.  And with the exception of his old girlfriend, most characters are typical small-town Southern stereotypes.  But, even with all these facts, I really enjoyed this short, crisp read.  Maybe it's just my age that I could identify with Neely's reflection back at the many things he would like to do differently.  Maybe it was the finely woven story of how football was the obsessive glue that gave this town it's pride and identity that I have seen so many times in real life.  Maybe it was the subplot of Jesse Trapp, the hometown hero gone bad that at the last minute forsakes himself to once again be part of the team and the town.  I don't exactly know why I connected with this book and quickly read through the last part to finish the story.  All I know is the time commitment was slight and the characters were familiar but emotionally attaching which made the book enjoyable to me.<br />In this story of unfinished business maybe the most touching is the meeting with his old girlfriend where for once Neely wants to pore out his heart but is rebutted.  The emotional anger was a great read as he tried to fight through it.  I leave it to you to see how this is resolved but it was as powerful as the Rake funeral at the end.<br />Neely went home even though we're told you can never go home.  And as much as he tried to act like it was not significant to him, it was the most emotionally cleansing act he had done in the last ten years.  And, for me, that was enough to fill an enjoyable afternoon in the middle of this book.  I believe this book will appeal to many females who like to read romance novels, and men with a retrospective nature.  And, yes, it may be of interest to former athletes as they see themselves in different stages of their life.  But it's not really a sports book.

Joe Eszterhas is an easy target to dislike for writing controversial movies like Basic Instinct and Showgirls.  I'm doing him a favor by leaving out flops like Jade and Sliver.<br />But this book accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.  It is an autobiography that highlights the three most compelling stories of his life, &quot;his rise from Hungarian immigrant and the bizarre past of his father, his life in the fast lane of Hollywood, and his family life with two different wives.  I was absolutely entertained by the Hollywood section and learned quite a bit in the other two.<br />This book will appeal to lovers of the Hollywood lifestyle or business environment.  It's all here. A novelist gets a call from an agent who believes he could write screenplays and a new career is born.  In the next 15 years he has written a box office smash and arguably the most controversial movie of the 90s.  But along the way he must learn the Hollywood dance of fighting for your life when many times it's predetermined that you will fail.  For example, when Sly Stallone steals his screen credit on his first made movie.  But more importantly, the controversial altercation with the then King of Hollywood, Mike Ovitz.  This section is fascinating reading if you have interest in how the business side of Hollywood works!  The Ovitz feud could be considered one of the top Hollywood stories of the last fifteen years as it started Ovitz's downfall.<br />Of course, there is plenty of name-dropping and stories told of life in Hollywood.  Particularly, Sharon Stone and her romance that breaks up a marriage.  And Joe Eszterhas does get in the act of constant cheating, drinking and drugging while maintaining the facade of a happy home life in Northern California.  Fascinating stuff!<br />But for all the glamour of Hollywood, this is still an autobiography of a poor immigrant family that comes to America after World War II and lives in poverty in New York and later Cleveland.  As Joe struggles to fit in the groundwork is laid for the heart wrenching family secret that is exposed when Joe is caring for his father.  It is emotionally wrenching for Eszterhas and could easily have been left out of the book, as it doesn't enhance sales.  But an autobiography correctly done is soul-cleansing so Eszterhas doesn't pull any punches and brings this compelling story to the book just as he had brought it to some of his lesser-known screenplays.<br />Blessed to have had two good marriages, this book tells the emotionally draining tale of how one ended and another began and the effect on wives, husband and kids.  It's always sad to see this as someone always ends up hurt.  But as much as Eszterhas wants to disavow Hollywood, his break-up is done in typical &quot;screenplay&quot; fashion and is very intriguing to the reader.<br />I typically like to read books that are 200 to 300 pages.  This is a real commitment at over 700 pages.  But it's worth the time commitment to get involved in the story.  One of the best books I have read from a man that will always be vilified by a large percent of the population based upon the morals of his life.  But as he now sits in suburban Cleveland, a survivor of cancer with a new young family, he is as much an American as a member of the Moral Majority.  I applaud Eszterhas on this fascinating book and sharing both the good and bad parts with the readers.glamour of Hollywood, this is still an autobiography of a poor immigrant family that comes to America after World War II and lives in poverty in New York and later Cleveland.

But seven years later she's still a wannabe waitress with no real acting credit when she comes to the realization that she never was really in the game.  They just wanted her to &quot;Take off your Shirt&quot;.<br />So what do you do when you tried to sleep yourself to fame and it didn't work?  Under that premise the author takes us on a fascinating journey of turning the tables on Hollywood and learning to play the Hollywood game the way it's played by the players, ruthlessly.<br />I found this book to be an enjoyable tale of a beautiful girl making it to the top on her own terms only to discover there is problems at the top also.  Be forewarned, I don't generally read steamy soft porn and this had it in there.  Very titillating and well written I might add.<br />This book should have a broad appeal.  Those who like entertainment books, romance novels, mystery novels or just fun beach reads should enjoy this book.  If you have very high morals and are easily offended, I'd take a pass.  But for others, it's a quick enjoyable book.	2004-03-17
US	52444905	R3IJX885TPEG5H	0316192945	63681096	American Sucker	Books	5	4	7	N	Y	Thought Provoking	This is a very important book describing the 90s, a decade of vast growth of wealth in America.  But our lifestyles also changed drastically with cell phones (anyone remember large 1989 cell phones), the Internet, and Personal Computing Devices.  These technology advances pushed many people into the stock market after watching the vast fortunes made by normal people.  It seemed like everyone felt they were a market expert.<br />So what is a devout liberal to do when he is in the throes of a painful divorce that will significantly change his lifestyle?  Put on his capitalist hat and joining the rat race to become a millionaire from stock gains.  And for a while it works.  But later, he learns the hard lessons of the market and what it can do to the least informed.<br />In addition to the blind rush to join the stock market craze, other interesting subjects include this liberal's internal conflict with his capitalist adventure, the emotional conflict of his divorce and the effect on his family.  Denby also was able to access many of the stock market stars because he was a journalist.  The CEO of IMCLONE who is convicted of insider trading is featured as is interviews with Henry Blodgett, the Internet Analyst who was interviewed while the author played the market.  This is particularly interesting to hear quotes supporting the market as it becomes clear it has been overvalued.<br />Ten years from now people can read this book to reconstruct a feel of living in the 90s, stock market gains and harried lifestyles.  While I work in the finance business, even if you have NO interest in the stock market, this book will be of interest to explore the mental anguish of divorce and the effect on the family.  I strongly recommend this book to stock market enthusiasts, individuals with interest in recent history, people interested in the impact of divorce, and a movie enthusiast as the author is a very well-known movie critic.	2004-03-02

I have run into Robertson at Cincinnati ballgames and hotels when in the city although have not spoken to him.  This is a biography written in typical form,  &quot;Here's what I did growing up, here's the influence of my parents and others, here's what I did that you know me for and here's what I'm doing now.&quot;  But the difference is Oscar really has something to say and he's rattled a few cages saying it.<br />While many people come from poor backgrounds, particularly basketball players, Oscar's is particularly interesting due to the very rural nature of his upbringing in Tennessee.  Most of his early life was centered on working in fields, church and family.  A move to inner city Indianapolis was significant in his development as a basketball player.  And this is where the book becomes very interesting as Oscar conveys the first noticeable slights from racism. Oscar has always been very well mannered projecting a great image.  And maybe in many ways this hid the hurt he was feeling from racism or maybe I was just too young to hear about it.<br />After rising to a top star, Robertson commits to a smaller school, U of Cincinatti, amid rumblings of improper recruiting. He dispels most of this and introduces boosters or mentors who took his best interests at heart and helped him grow as a man.  He also meets his wife who he describes in glowing terms, clearly a very strong marriage that eventually yields two daughters.  This is another interesting part of the book as one of his daughters suffers from a disease requiring an organ transplant.<br />Robertson starts his pro career in his hometown of Cincinnati with an under funded team which creates conflicts throughout his career there as money and a good supporting cast is always short.  Discussing his pro career you can really see his bitterness with the pre-free agent market and how he had to fight for his money and was often blamed for putting himself above his team.  This for a man that averaged a triple-double.  If you follow the NBA today, you will almost find the numbers thrown around as comical.<br />Clearly, this book has generated controversy as Robertson has alluded to racism throughout the book.  While it didn't match the impression I had of Robertson, I found he supported his positions well even though you may not agree with the outcome.<br />Overall, I found this to be an excellent book of a basketball icon in the late 50s to 70s.  If you have interest in sports in those periods, life in America in those periods, or a short view of race relations at that time, I think you will enjoy this book as much as I did.ney and was often blamed for putting himself above his team.

It is a very good example of investigative journalism and also an example of poor editing.  Please don't include everything you learned.  Maybe he needed Harvey Weinstein to edit the book!<br />What is good is a very detailed (perhaps too much so) look at the evolution of independent films from \\"Sex, Lies, & Videotapes\\" to the current state of independent films approaching the Hollywood route.  There is no question he did exhaustive research and while he has been criticized for doing a hatchet job on Miramax and Redford, there are too many stories with the same theme for the portrait painted to not be substantially correct IMO.  If you are a fan of film, whether you are a casual weekend fan of Hollywood fare or a student of serious film, there is something here for you.  But generally this will be of interest if you enjoy following the business side of films and how the personalities affect this.  However, the book also does a great job overlaying the careers of Steve Soderberg, Quentin Tarantino and Damon/Affleck in enough detail for the fans of \\"stars\\".  The Damon/Affleck section is particularly interesting as it showed two kids viewed as actors making a conscious effort to tap into the indie craze to get their break in the business.  In many respects it's like the old Stallone/Rocky story of having the screenplay and forcing Hollywood to use the author as the star.<br />Now for the negative.  His earlier book \\"Easy Rider/Raging Bull\\" covered the 70s film explosion in great depth.  It appears he was trying to recreate the magic in this book.  While the evolution of independent films is a worthwhile subject, what he ended up with is a book about Miramax with brief interludes about other stories that can almost be distractive.  Just look at the title where he tries to throw too much explanation.  To me, this is an unauthorized biography of Miramax.  That's OK.  There's plenty to cover there and he did it quite well.  But to continue the charade by occasionally throwing in visits to the mess @ Sundance just distracts the reader.  Maybe he thought it would help sell books by throwing some dirt on Redford.<br />This book is a real commitment.  It is long, detailed reading that takes time.  But the payoff is worth it.  It easy to see while you are reading that there will be many upset executives and I doubt he will have as much access if he makes another attempt at a Hollywood subject.

This is a very good book of a recent college grad who after the death of his mother is given an opportunity to be a hedge fund trader.  In a year he goes from not wanting the job to being one of the top traders and all the internal office politics that develop.<br />But this is no ordinary job and he wasn't recruited based upon his intelligence.  The novel starts with two deaths of people who do business with the hedge fund as well as the death of his mother.  Morris weaves many different plot lines like the death of his mother, his family life and a relationship with the attorney of the hedge fund, his love life involving the daughter of the attorney, and his conflicted views of wealth.<br />Overlapping these story lines is a great \\"whodunit\\" as the new trader fights to learn a business and duck clues that may involve him in an elaborate scheme.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in a good murder mystery built around a financial world background.	2004-02-18

I was not disappointed.  In fact it exceeded my expectations.<br />Adam Cassidy is an entry level 20-something from a disjointed family going through the motions of holding a job.  With his only living family member being an aged, bitter father in poor health, Adam really doesn't have a lot going for him.  A minor embezzlement for a loading dock retirement party leaves him with the choice of jail or corporate espionage, with a bonus.  To be able to perform, he is given a new persona, product information, money and a car.  Consider it on-the-job MBA training.  So the stakes are high, back to legal problems and jail or complete his espionage assignment in an incredibly difficult environment.<br /><br />After this brief set-up, Adam is thrown to the wolves at the new company while trying to perform at a high level, endear himself to his bosses, and begin a love life with a beautiful co-worker.  If that isn't enough, his boss takes an interest in him that raises conflicts in both parties as to their relationships to their relatives.  How do you know when you find a book interesting?  Well, when I was reading the office break-in scenes they are so well written that I was actually nervous he<br />was going to be caught.  Much like when you watch a movie.<br />This is a very entertaining book.  Great for a weekend read, business trip or vacation read.  Read this if you like mysteries or suspense.  I was originally attracted to this, as I like reading business \\"story\\" books.  This book also will appeal to all ages above teenagers.  Thanks Joe, I'm a new fan.	2004-01-14

This book is short, 200 pages,in big print, and makes a point of not taking itself too seriously as it describes a humorous, hard-working and deceptive Wall Street.<br />Kessler was an engineer plucked from obscurity to become a stock analyst. With simple but great advice from his boss, Kessler flies by the seat of his pants learning the business from 1985 to the mid 90s. But what makes this book perfect is while he describes life on Wall Street and the many conflicts of interest as he learns the business, his Wall Street years were spent working along side many famous analyst who moved the market in the late 90s to the biggest stock market rally in history. Jack Grubman is the most prominent and is described as a good friend, fun-loving guy of incredible talent who later in life controlled the telecom market possibly with questionable tactics. Later he works with Frank Quattrone, known as the banker for the Internet. As an analyst, Quattrone and Kessler were many times on opposite sides of client debates. Kessler humorously describes their battles and debates while giving credit to Frank's unique talents and giving hints of how he might have helped in his downfall. Mary Meeker and Henry Blodgett are also mentioned from a perspective few investors would see from just reading about them in magazines or newspapers.<br />I can't over-emphasize how much fun this book is. Many times authors try to tell you everything they know. Kessler, possibly from experience writing concise research reports, does a great job of saying a lot without using many words wasting your time. While this book will be good for anyone wanting to learn of the conflicts reseach analysts must face, it is a must read for novice or hobby stockpickers. If nothing else but to show you the system you are working against. I strongly recommend this book for all readers with interest in finance or the stock market.<br />DISCLOSURE:  I wrote this review for the Hardback copy.

By overlaying a devastating ambush in Vietnam causing massive American casualties with a protest at the Univ. of Wisconsin Madison campus, Marinuss shows the full range of the American perspective as it was impacted by the war.  But in addition to these two viewpoints, Marinuss also reconstructs meetings inside the White House and at Military headquarters as they debate the merits of the war and the political ramifications.  Marinuss does a great job showing the anguish in the country as well as in the White House.<br />While the total book is engrossing and filled with facts reconstructing the mood of the county, I actually found the mood of American political and military leaders most interesting.  Clearly, LBJ was caught in a quagmire and regretted the course in which he had led the country.  Military leaders come off much worse with continued misinformation to attempt to mislead the American public as to the status of the war.  Most telling is after this horrible ambush, not only do the leaders refuse to call it an ambush, they grossly misstate the Viet Cong killed to give the appearance that more were killed than Americans and therefore it must be an American victory.  This is sad as many brave Americans were slaughtered and this misinformation does them no justice.<br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone with interest in the real Vietnam War both home and abroad.  Also, I recommend this book for anyone wanting to know what it was like living in America in the 60s.  One word of caution.  This book is a commitment of over 400 pages in small print.  While this is very well researched, if I have one complaint, the author seemed to want to tell the complete story of every character he introduced and therefore at times in can be long and slow and slightly off topic.<br />As a final note, for any soldiers reading this, I applaud you on performing your duty in very trying times.

This book is a mixture of good and bad.  The author is an extremely experienced research analyst and director so he knows the subject.  Maybe too well.  This book gives a complete view of what is involved working as an analyst from the type work, the incestuous relationships, to the sexist environment encountered on Wall Street trading floors.  You will leave this book feeling much more confident in your understanding of Wall Street and for that purpose this is a great read.<br />But, the author is clearly not experienced in novel writing and it appears he tried to jam every anecdote of his career into one novel.  And that unfortunately, makes the book read very slowly.  The research director in the novel is on a search to hire top analyst.  Page upon page is discussions of who to hire and the status of each recruiting search ad nauseum.  He clearly made an effort to drop the name of every friend still in the business.  This subplot could have been shortened in half and since it's the central story of the book, I think you can see how this could inflate and slow the book.<br />That aside, the other story lines are interesting but play  lower roles and are left for extended lengths of time even though they may have increased the interest to the readers.  Stories such as blatant sexual harrassment and moving stocks for analyst's personal gain or in cahoots with Russian thieves, not to mention for the sexual favors of a client, would probably have moved the novel along just fine without an in-depth analysis of how to hire an analyst.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this book.  But only because I had an in-depth interest in learning about the working environment of stock research analyst as it is another side of the business I am in.  I would recommend this book for anyone with interest in the stock market.  But be forewarned.  I believe many will find this book boring and too detailed.

This book is short, 200 pages,in big print, and makes a point of not taking itself too seriously as it describes a humorous, hard-working and deceptive Wall Street.<br />Kessler was an engineer plucked from obscurity to become a stock analyst.  With simple but great advice from his boss, Kessler flies by the seat of his pants learning the business from 1985 to the mid 90s.  But what makes this book perfect is while he describes life on Wall Street and the many conflicts of interest as he learns the business, his Wall Street years were spent working along side many famous analyst who moved the market in the late 90s to the biggest stock market rally in history.  Jack Grubman is the most prominent and is described as a good friend, fun-loving guy of incredible talent who later in life controlled the telecom market possibly with questionable tactics.  Later he works with Frank Quattrone, known as the banker for the Internet.  As an analyst, Quattrone and Kessler were many times on opposite sides of client debates.  Kessler humorously describes their battles and debates while giving credit to Frank's unique talents and giving hints of how he might have helped in his downfall.  Mary Meeker and Henry Blodgett are also mentioned from a perspective few investors would see from just reading about them in magazines or newspapers.<br />I can't over-emphasize how much fun this book is.  Many times authors try to tell you everything they know.  Kessler, possibly from experience writing concise research reports, does a great job of saying a lot without using many words wasting your time.  While this book will be good for anyone wanting to learn of the conflicts reseach analysts must face, it is a must read for novice or hobby stockpickers.  If nothing else but to show you the system you are working against.  I strongly recommend this book for all readers with interest in finance or the stock market.n finance or the stock market.	2004-01-03

Now, that can be a very dry subject if you are not focused on learning.  But the authors do a good job of using examples of other companies so it constantly reads like a business biography and is much more interesting than reading a college textbook.<br />Did I learn something?  Yes.  By the fourth chapter I was applying the principals discussed to how I could change my business model.  Overall I found this to be an excellent read.  But you must bring something to the table for this book.  For example, most books I read are for entertainment.  This book is work.  Come prepared to learn and this book will teach	2003-12-22

This is a story of a Staten Island teenager who signs on at a chop shop set up to bilk customers of their money.  While poorly educated, Louis Pasciuto finds he has a knack for selling and can easily talk these people in to investing with him.  But since this is a scam where the brokers make massive money and the customers lose, it's hardly investing at all.<br />Giving an uneducated 20-year-old massive money is dangerous.  As he doesn't trust banks, he develops a better use of him money, spend it.  Spend it on toys, women, trips, and drugs until eventually his monthly living expenses are so high he has money troubles that end with a mafia guy entering his life for a monthly taste.  Now that's a whole other problem.<br />Louis Pasciuto's personal history is a perfect overlay for a demonstration of how the mafia infiltrated the investment business.  Stories of mafia guys coming in and slapping their brokers around for money are unsettling at best.  As always, this doesn't end happily.<br />I strongly recommend this book for an entertaining educational read of what can go wrong in the investment world.  For further info on this subject, see the DVD, Boiler Room with Ben Affleck for another perspective of this 1990s phonemen.  Although starting a little slow, once you are engaged in reading this book you cannot put it down.	2003-12-19

I like his movies, particularly ones such as LA Story and Bowfinger which give you a view on how he views the world.<br />&quot;Pleasure&quot; is like this but on a much different scope.  We sometimes view celebrities as having it all together but reading this book gives you a view of the insecurities and depth of Steve Martin's mind.<br />But in the end I must be entertained.  I found the first part of the book slow and slightly confusing.  But after the set-up, the character development is excellent as you search for the subjects that you most identify with.  And, of course, Martin's dry-witted humor is sprinkled throughout and quite entertaining.  By the end of the book you are emotionally attached to the characters and enjoy the contrived, happy ending.  While I was not bowled over by the book, I did enjoy it.  It is a very short read.	2003-12-19

From a large, poor, loving family, David rose to basketball fame @ NC State.  Everyone remembers the great team that beat Ucla, but most aren't aware of the NC State history in the previous year.  It was quite impressive also and it's unfortunate they weren't able to compete on a national level then.<br />After this great college career and significant credit given to family, coaches and teammates, Thompson chooses the ABA over the NBA and is one of the trendsetters that highlighted this league for exciting basketball.  But while correctly relaying his significance to the league, Thompson is required to discuss his fall into drugs and alcohol.  And quite a fall it is.  Thompson doesn't leave anything out although I suspect his version of the scuffle @ Studio 54 may be a little one-sided probably to protect his wife to whom he is still married.<br />We all read of Thompson's drug problems but this book describes the depths of the fall and it's not sugarcoated.  Frankly, it's amazing that he is still married to the same lady and I applaud her for her persistence that was more than he deserved.  For a truly great hero, it's nice to see his complete rehabilitation to gainful employment again.  I applaud David Thompson for having the courage to tell this story when most people would have swept in under the rug to reduce any embarrassment.  Life is what you make it and David seems to now understand this better than most.	2003-11-28

It's a behind the scenes look at their development from early teens to young pros.  As you might imagine, Serena and Venus come across as the loving, precocious girls they are.  Their father comes across as the self-important, spotlight-grabbing huckster that he is.<br />Richard Williams always projected himself as the only coach of the sisters.  Rineberg dispels that notion and discusses his involvement in their development.  As a relative unknown tennis coach, it must have been a thrill to be given the opportunity to coach such gifted athletes.<br />But the real benefit of this book is the opportunity to get a behind the scenes look at what type people Serena and Venus are.  I think this book does an excellent job of exhibiting their personality.  Both are outgoing, fun girls who clearly have a great love for each other.  Coming from a different tennis background having not played any junior tournaments, there was great resentment to their potential.  This resentment, I believe, has caused many to wrongly dislike the Williams sisters.  But whether you like or dislike the sisters, it's very clear that they are very unique, intelligent and fun-loving sisters.<br />Overall, this book doesn't have much to say.  \\"I was lucky to coach two great kids.  Their dad is a huckster who doesn't follow-thru on his promises.\\"  But, to get a behind the scenes look at the real personality of the Williams sisters, that was enough for me.	2003-11-28

Hollywood inside jokes abound and I couldn't put the book down even though it was very late at night. Unfortunately, all the time the author has spent having fun in a novel, now has to be wrapped up in a finished book that requires that he tie up all the loose ends.  Therefore the last half of the book reads like a screenplay for a one hour TV drama. Hmmm, this author should be experienced at that.<br />Overall, I very much enjoyed this book as a light, funny read with plenty of inside jokes to satisfy followers of the industry.  It then becomes the solving of a murder mystery with sex thrown in.  Some of my favorites subjects.  A great book to take to the beach or for a cross-country flight.	2003-11-28

Having followed this team weekly it was interesting to see the historical perspective of this upstart league.  I fondly remember collecting the football cards of Jack Kemp, Keith Lincoln, Paul Lowe and Tobin Rote.  But this league is more known for it's famous characters such as wrestler Ernie Ladd, Cookie Gilchrist and Joe Namath.<br />This book allows the players to talk of their experiences, as there are liberal quotes throughout.  It tells the story of a poorly financed league that played exciting football that eventually required the conservative, more established NFL to merge.  A great example of how upstart the league was is the Miami Dolphins.  Ownership was given to Minnesota attorney, Joe Robbie, who struggled to make payroll and among other mismanagement stories, managed to turn the franchise into the only undefeated team ever and make his family a fortune.<br />Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys football.  Players such as Joe Namath and the owners and founders in this league did more than you can imagine turning football into the enjoyable shoot-out now enjoyed by everyone.	2003-11-28

This book is a compilation of previous interviews and past stories.  Many of these are excellent.  There is quite a bit of past champions pre-dating my life that were informative.  But after initially enjoying the stories, eventually they weaken and become repetitive.  I believe this book should be about 2/3 the size it currently is.

Are derivatives bad?  Well, they can be.  Partnoy builds the case that derivatives were sold that carried massive risk to customers that did not understand them.  In addition, the salesmen were greedy individuals raping and pillaging only to make money with no regard for the customer's well being.  While I don't find this totally wrong, any customers who are buying assets they don't understand should share in the blame.  For example, he gives the Gibson Greeting example where they are making an interest rate bet with their investment while stating they had no such risk.  You can't have it both ways.<br />Irrespective of this double standard for investors (I want higher returns unless it goes bad then I want to sue), Partnoy brings some very valid criticism.  The massive off-balance sheet investments hiding true risk were inappropriate and harmful to shareholders.  I think Partnoy does an excellent job examining this risk and presenting his case with Enron and Worldcom specifically as examples.  The interesting point he made in this book I wasn't aware of is that Enron's trading operation was highly profitable and was a solid going concern until the liquidity crunch of the publicity.<br />But derivatives that are appropriately understood can be excellent investments.  In the 80s CMOs (Collateralized Mortgage Obligation) were invented allowing investors to invest in short tranches to receive lower average lives to match their funding liabilities.  This was a great investment for many banks for which credit is not given in this book.  Now, these type derivatives did have extension risk or prepay risk if mortgages prepaid faster or slower than anticipated.  In the 90s we saw volatility of many markets that caused such fluctuations and left an aftermath of blame placing.  But in this case, the derivative was not the issue, market prepayments were.<br />Be forewarned this is not light reading.  This book took twice as long as most I read due to the complexity of the examples.  It is an interesting read but a complex read.  I would strongly recommend this book for finance geeks or stock investors who would like an in-depth look at how company financial statements could be manipulated.<br />DISCLOSURE:  I took a massive loss in Worldcom preferred stock based on the accounting fraud.

Overall, I would say I'm slightly disappointed for not getting more in-depth into Pat Rafter the man.  This is nothing but a simplistic diary of a year traveling the circuit, what he did at tournaments, where he practiced and with whom, and status of his injuries.<br />There is nothing in this book to criticize; it's just very simplistic reading.  Pat is the epitome of an Australian man, a great athlete who credits his mates and his family for his strong bearing.  Everyone knows Pat likes to toast a few and this book describes a few all-nighters after key wins.<br />Unfortunately, this book needed to be written sooner.  The yearlong diary covers few highlights.  He did make it to the semi-final of Wimbledon losing to Agassi and he did play in the Davis Cup match in Boston beating the Americans in an epic struggle with Todd Martin.  But while the book starts after he won his second US Open, it ends with him losing in the first round of the US Open in 1999.<br />Probably the most interesting part of the book to me was the squabbles with Pete Sampras, my other favorite player.  Pat starting beating Pete and I assumed Pete was struggling with this and was at fault for fallout by some of his comments.  From reading this I suspect Pat was just at much at fault based on comments made at a press conference and the way he states his side of the relationship.  Irrespective, they're both quality individuals and great players who went at it from different angles.  It says a lot for their character that they talked on the phone to hash out any difference and can both walk away with respect for each other.<br />I don't mean to be disrespectful to Pat about this review.  I miss his game.  You knew when you watched a Pat Rafter match you got 100% effort win or lose and that attitude comes through loud and clear.  I just wish it had covered more background about his upbringing including his junior tennis career to show how he grew into such a champion.ing including his junior tennis career to show how he grew into such a champion.	2003-10-06

It is written like a collection of short stories, most dealing with fellow soldiers who are killed in action.  The author does a great job of portraying the horror of war and the acts he is now embarrassed by, but more importantly, the tight bonds that were formed with other soldiers and the trauma caused by their death.<br />While I assumed this to be autobiographical with some basis in fact, some parts read like you're watching &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.  There is one story of an American's young girlfriend flying over and hiding out with the soldiers and how it changes her.  Clearly, this didn't happen but I believe he's trying to demonstrate the mental battle fought by all the men.<br />This is a fine book but not exactly what I was looking for.  My favorite Vietnam book is &quot;They were Soldiers Once .....&quot; as it tells a specific battle tale, shows the horror of war and the heroics of our men.  This is more a thought provoking look at the travesty of war.  An excellent read, just not the type book I was looking for.	2003-09-05

This book qualifies and has the added appeal of the popular 90s theme of IPOs on Internet assets.  But then the author tried to throw in every other novel clich&eacute;.  Let's make the successful business owner a former pilot.  Don't forget the love interest with plenty of twists.  And remember when you make a novel, Clancy's spy thrillers sell well so let's revisit a Russian theme as the bad guys.  And make sure you kill plenty of people as that sells well also.<br />Eventually I realized I wasn't reading a novel based around a finance theme but a \\"novel clich&eacute;\\".  Too much of anything eventually becomes boring.  With this many subjects to cover, nothing can be developed fully.  It's a fairly long, disjointed book that tries to do too much.  I'd take a pass unless all of the subjects I mentioned above are really attractive to you.	2003-09-02

This is it.  A very enjoyable, quick read on the plane or day at the beach.<br />After personal tragedy with lovers our lead character lands a position as the personal assistant to a young NBA star who she immediately helps organize his life and upgrade her lifestyle in the process. But this very attractive 38-year-old women is just too irresistible to too many men and that leads to an interesting novella of falling in and out of bed at the same time she is falling further into confusion.<br />Since the author was the personal assistant to Stephon Marbury of the Phoenix Suns, you can be assured there is some truth to the stories which would no longer shock any fan of the NBA.  I recommend this book if you want a short, mildly erotic read.	2003-09-02

Actually, I read the first 100 pages and left my book at an airport. After a week I was interested enough in the characters that I had to buy another.<br />This book narrates the lives of two girls growing up in the ghetto trying to break out of past patterns and how they are drug back in. They recognize what their value is and become determined to use it to their advantage.  But sometimes when you play with fire you get fire, and that's exactly what happens.<br />I found this an interesting read that in the last quarter of the book has some interesting plot twists that make the book even more interesting.  If you are interested in reading a book of growing up in the ghetto, even though there are stereotypes and exaggerations, I would recommend this book.	2003-08-21

How fitting that during this period of no air conditioning, Satellite Television or DVDs, one of the books I selected to read was The Greatest Generation.  As one generation removed from a family raised on a farm in Missouri, I'm very familiar with the work ethic of my grandparents born around the turn of the century.<br />This book was spectacular!  Brokaw weaves his descriptions of what the influences of this generation were, mainly the Depression, with their stories of the war, but also their stories of coming back home and how they lived their lives.  Now that they had rescued the world from a tyrant, they came back to America and built a new country filled with conveniences not previously imagined by our rural population.<br />Brokaw does a good job of covering the many different factions of the generation, not just the soldiers.  After covering stories of soldiers, he switches gears and covers stories of the women left behind in America and what their lives were like.  He also spent a great deal of time covering minorities such as African-American, native Indians, Hispanic, and Japanese Americans.  These are fascinating stories and allow the reader to visualize the problems these minorities faced and how they overcame adversity.<br />The most touching chapter for me was the stories of the two girls that married and the husbands immediately were shipped overseas.  Both ladies had babies that never met their father.  Some of the chapters are just OK but some may bring you to tears as it did me.  When I reached one of the final chapters that was titled \\"Famous People\\" it felt inappropriate to read this like these \\"famous people\\" needed a special chapter when the previous chapters had clearly shown the ultimate sacrifices made by real Americans.  I debated stopping right there.  After a day, I picked the book back up and read through this section and I'm glad I did even though I didn't find these stories as touching.  Some of these people had excellent stories of valor also and the fact they are famous should not be held against them as they sacrificed also.  And that is the theme of this book; a generation that made the ultimate sacrifice so that the remainder of us could live excellent lives.<br />The fact that this generation of soldiers felt no need to come back and brag about their exploits is really amazing given the \\"me\\" first environment we now find ourselves in.  My father-in-law passed away this year and he never mentioned the war although I was aware he was twice wounded in the European effort.  So, knowing his days were numbered, I brought the subject up one day in front of his family.  He had no problem talking of his exploits but it was really unfulfilling how he described it. It was no longer a big event to him.  Just something that happened a long time ago.  He was much more interested in the latest football game on television or the four children he raised while working in a blue-collar job.<br />READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!  Recognize the responsibility we have to live to this great standard.<br />Addendum: After rereading some of the negative reviews on this book I'm compelled to at least mention them.  It seems the negative reviews fall into journalistic complaints, political dislikes for Brokaw, or jealousy that their generation was not honored.  I was actually surprised by the venom directed a the book and there are substantial reviews like this.  It does not change my opinion although I certainly honor their beliefs.  True, he is not the best writer.  But I did not let that limit my emotional attachment to the sacrifices made for some of these people.  One writer mentioned watching Saving Private Ryan instead.  I have watched that movie repeatedly and feel it is an artistic masterpiece of reflecting the brutality of war.<br />I don't think Brokaw was trying to compare generations. He's just saying that what this generation was called on to do, ie, depression followed by a World War, is deserved of an honor.  I am a 49 year old boomer.  I do not believe that our generation would be as dedicated to the task although there are massive numbers that would are still there.  I'm certainly happy to admit that I'm glad I did not have to fight this type war.<br />I respect everyone's opinion but still felt thrilled to read about the sacrifices made for later generations.  I hope to visit Normandy soon and maybe in some way honor this great sacrifice.s generation was called on to do, ie, depression followed by a World War, is deserved of an honor.

I read some reviews and thought I was about to read a humorous book of the story behind the real \\"hurry up and wait\\" war. I was very disappointed.<br />I don't care to debate the reviews that range from very poor to great of this book. Clearly, most have an agenda of being proud of the Marines or very liberal in their viewpoints. I just wanted to be entertained or learn something. But I quickly realized I was not be entertained. None of the stories were humorous as said by reviewers. This was an immature young 18 year old entering the Marines. Possibly the biggest disappointment is that very little of the book was about the Gulf War. 80% of the book is about basic Marine life stateside. Let me summarize: Follow orders as little as possible, argue and drink with other Marines, brag about female conquests. Sorry, that's not enough to be entertaining.<br />After deployment to Saudi Arabia, at least there was some movement to discuss and his assignment as a sniper presented some knowledge of his importance. Eventually, he sees the enemy and some minor action but mainly he is seeing dead bodies. How these Marines react to these bodies may be interesting to some but not me. People died. War is hell.<br />In summary, I can't recommend this book. It's not humorous and clearly not patriotic. If you dislike the military, there is still not enough meat for it to be entertaining to you. I recommend you take a pass on this one.	2003-08-01

When I picked it up I assumed I was reading a story of 9/11.  But a small portion of this book covers the 9/11 incident.  In fact, for the first 50 pages, the book was rather boring and I couldn't understand where it was going. It starts in Africa where two soldiers meet and develop a bond.  Then it jumps to a college student who is studying in Portugal and refuses to have an affair with a married man.  Where is this book going?<br />But after this backfill, the book really supercharges.  Over half of the book covers Rescorla and Hill's military career, from work in Africa to rejoining the Army in time for Vietnam.  In Rescorla's case, he wasn't even an American.  They are both exceptional heroes and reading of their battles is very inspiring.  It's also interesting to watch their views of the war change as they view the carnage.  Although I had read \\"They Were Soldiers Once...\\", I did not remember Rescorla's name so it was fascinating to revisit his involvement and performance.<br />When the book leaves the military section but prior to the 9/11 event, there is an interesting section where Hill and Rescorla struggle with their identity as veterans of Vietnam, Rescorla particularly.  But possibly the most fascinating part of this book is Hill's prediction of the next wave of terrorist attacks and what they would target.  Hill participated in the Muslim religion including trips to Afghanistan and presented the FBI with an interesting proposal about Osama Bin Laden prior to 9/11.<br />And that's what makes this book so compelling.  These two men touched four continents but seemed to always be involved in fascinating history that concludes with 9/11.  Prior to 9/11 the book details a fascinating love story which finally ties back the confusing start of the book.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you have interest in war stories, particularly the Vietnam War, patriotism or fascinating details of 9/11.  But the real reason you should read this book is to learn of a sincere man who chose to become and American and lived a normal middle-aged life until he found the love of his life which sparked his existence and gave him the strength to deal with cancer.reason you should read this book is to learn of a sincere man who chose to become and American and lived a normal middle-aged life until he found the love of his life which sparked his existence and gave him the strength to deal with cancer.	2003-08-01

Many contemporary writers struggle with rating players from previous generations.  But while there was some weighting to players of the last 20 years, Mike did a good job of including many very old players, some of whom I was not familiar with.<br />This is a great coffee table book positioned where you view games on TV.  You'll be surprised how many people will pick up the book and then start debating the rankings.  It's a great book to start conversations.<br />DISCLOSURE:  Mike is a friend of mine who I met when he lived in Memphis in the mid 90s.  I have followed his career to The Sporting News and enjoy his articles as well as friendly banter on his opinions of college basketball.  Mike is a respected sports journalist who is just now beginning to get the recognition he deserves.	2003-08-01

Unfortunately, one particular crime was more heinous that most, the cold-blooded murder of a housewife in a botched robbery.  Years later this comes back to haunt Chris Ludwigsen/Chris Pacello.<br />Pacello becomes involved in a nightclub in South Beach that becomes very hot.  He changes his image from a mafia goon to a suave nightclub owner to the stars.  It's amazing how far he travels from his past.  A few changes to the wardrobe, new hairstyle, talk a little less Brooklyn, continue the steroids and have something the celebrities want, a really hot nightclub in a great party town and you're good to go.  Of course, you can't take the city out of the boy so there are run-ins with his first partner, an arson and a few beatings that must be administered.  A small price to pay to date beautiful women in my book.<br />But once he thinks he has it all, his world comes crashing down as he is arrested and tried for the murder.  This book does a great job following the twist and turns in the trial as well as the intricacies of the underworld hierarchy.  While this is not a work of art, if you enjoy reading about the crime world, or you enjoy celebrity name-dropping, you will enjoy this book.	2003-08-01

If you like climbing and comedy, you'll like this book.  Approximately 70 short stories of climbs that almost ended badly.  You can learn from this book.  But some of the lessons are very elementary.  Like the climber climbing big wall Yosemite with a new girl he had just met who had never climbed.  Might want to pick your partner a little better.  And another quick tip, you might want to stay away from the drugs and alcohol while climbing.<br />Each story ends with a quick analysis of what should have been done to stay out of the situation.  Some of this is helpful.  But generally it can be summed up in a sentence:  Don't do dumb things while climbing.  Unless, of course, you want to entertain readers.	2003-08-01

While this book limits it's history to Beverly Hills leaving out other interesting areas like Bel Air, it does a magnificent job of summarizing the history of 90210 as well as chronologically tracing the changes in the city.<br />Some of the significant stories that I liked were the history of the original developer, the influx of what were considered lower status people, ie, actors, the history of the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Arab influence in the 1970s and the changing retail environment of the Golden Triangle.  This book also has some great pictures.  My personal favorite was the BH Hotel with massive empty land all around.  If you've been by in the last 30 years you know how weird empty land appears.<br />This book also devotes a chapter to a Howard Hefner wannabe who started Perfect 10 magazine.  Beverly Hills definitely attracts beautiful women, many of whom are looking for a way to live in the mansions.  Also, there is a great chapter on the founder of Herbalife who came from nothing to own a great old mansion while planning to build a 40,000 sq. foot mansion.  One year later, he's dead.<br />If you want a history of Beverly Hills and what it is like to live there, this is the perfect book.	2003-08-01

While I enjoyed reading this book as I have all of Long's climbing stories, I just can't see the thrill of tackling mountains alone.  The element of danger is raised exponentially.  Therefore, I didn't identify with the climbers and why they take this risk.  It does detail these climbers and why so many feel the desire to climb alone in dangerous conditions. Personally, it just made me more comfortable on an indoor rock wall.  Climbers will still enjoy the read however.	2003-08-01

This book is a cross between a \\"how-to\\" book and a book filled with industry anecdotes.  This book gives great advice on how to perform in your job working for an egomaniac (they almost all are) and why you want to get out of that job as soon as possible.  But it also provides quite a few hilarious stories that will have the normal office worker scratching their heads at the audacity of some of these bosses.  Working in investment banking I've seen my share of egomaniacs but Hollywood is the place to be if you want to reach for the stars or meet some real asses.  This book gives a good overview on what you can expect.<br />Since I'm not interested in an assistant's job, I was looking more for stories of the industry.  This book satisfied that desire but with some down time as it educated the potential assistant.  Overall, I'm pleased with the read but if you want to know about the industry and the abuse of new hires, I recommend the recent book, \\" The Mailroom: Hollywood History from the Bottom Up.\\"	2003-08-01

Significant Hollywood players who are mentioned include Steve McQueen and Mike Ovitz who once again is portrayed negatively.  I suspect he's used to that by now.<br />I found this to be a very fast enjoyable read if you like nonfiction and Hollywood history.  My only complaint is the ending seemed to be thrown together and seemed to leave a few unresolved issues to explore like the father's former girlfriend who is now pregnant.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book and thoroughly enjoyed it.	2003-07-29

In addition to finding the campus awe-inspiring, I was impressed with the camradre of the cadets we conversed with as well as their demeanor.  This book does a fantastic job of detailing the West Point experience.  Examples of significant items covered include: West Point's evolving role in the new Army and the politics involved, drugs and alcohol usage, female enrollment and issues, and Plebe hazing.<br />What this book does spectacularly well is track cadets for the 4 year period through West Point to their initial assignments in the military.  It reads like a soap opera.  Top flight leadership candidates are tripped dating fellow cadets.  Top graduates struggle with balancing girlfriends and family and lose their competitive edge in their first assignments after West Point and take lower profile assignments.<br />While there are many cadets tracked throughout the book, my two favorite stories were George Rast, the candidate just trying to get by who they attempted to run out of West Point all four years, and Huck Finn, the football player from Lousiana who has a major transformation in personal growth.  The in-depth analysis of the various commanders is also very touching as we get to see one leader \\"take the fall\\" to maintain his personal principals when it wasn't necessary.<br />The fact that this book overlaps the 9/11/01 incident only heightens the experience of being a voyeur of the Academy.  This book will make you proud to be an American watching these kids grow into exceptional young men and women with varying degrees of belief in a career as an Army officer.  Some of these stories reduced me to tears and I believe you will find them as touching.  BUY THIS BOOK.<br />ADDENDUM:  In 2000 I attended an Army football game.  Here is the Internet Article I wrote that provoked my reading of this book.<br />DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY<br />Memphis at Army<br />Why is a trip to West Point considered the epitome of the college football experience as voted by Sporting News, Sports Illustrated and others?  Set on the Hudson River at a particularly high and beautiful spot, the campus may be the most beautiful in America.  The rolling hills, littered with rocks and trees set high over the Hudson were a great starting point to build the very old, but perfectly preserved stone buildings on this campus originally formed in 1802.  But the perfect college campus is much more than a physical layout.  The mystic and school spirit permeate the campus like a hidden ghost.  And no campus in America has this more than West Point.  Not Notre Dame. Not Harvard, Yale or Princeton.  And certainly not any state school.<br />Football Saturday starts with the 10:00 parade on the Plains surrounded by the stone buildings to the West and the Hudson River to the North and East.  There is no better place than here to come in contact with the spirit of the United States of America and the commitment made by so many to preserve it's heritage.  You find yourself wanting to thank these eighteen year-old cadets for the commitment they are making to preserve American freedom and values.<br />The parade is built around the marching band, not \\"state school\\" sized, but big enough to perfectly capture the music of the country.  After the band's march to playing position, regiments of cadets magically emerge from openings in the architecturally gifted campus buildings.  Dressed in their gray multi-buttoned dress shirts, white pants and black top hats with plume, they strike an opposing contrast to the stone buildings.  Surprisingly, Navy and Air Force cadets participate on a selected basis in an exchange program and march intermingled with the cadets forming a united front as the band plays the anthem from all four armed services.  Following these rousing renditions, the band breaks into the Tiger fight song on this day for the benefit of their esteemed guests.<br />In perfect unison with swords or guns drawn the regiments pass the grandstand.  Civilians are instructed in proper etiquette as the parade builds to the playing of the national anthem and presenting of the colors.  Maybe if you see this enough, the pride and patriotism become mundane and your eyes don't water and the lump leaves your throat.  But maybe, if your lucky, it doesn't and you stand there thankful that you were able to experience this and more fully understand what makes this country great.  And maybe now you understand the commitment these outstanding young men and women have undertaken to follow in the footsteps of Dwight Eisenhower, Norman Schwarzkof and Douglas MacArthur, not to mention Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant.<br /><br />As the parade ends, tailgating resumes on this 16,000-acre campus.  No one is concerned with what other teams are doing on this day as you occasionally catch a mother visiting her cadet son or two West Point alumnus from the 1960's catching up on where their travels have taken them in the last 30 years.  But in three hours you're in for another treat as 40,000 people cram into the stadium constructed in 1925 next to Lusk Reservoir and surrounded by hills.  Almost all of the 4,000 cadets are in required attendance as they march in together followed by their pep band, three mules and \\"golf cart\\" cannon.  The school spirit is incredible and it's difficult to focus on the game while enjoying the antics of the young cadets who just an hour earlier would have gone out of their way to answer questions and point out sites of interest while making sure to punctuate each sentence with multiple \\"sirs\\" in a sign of respect.  And with this atmosphere as a background, you struggle to root against this quality opponent who is there to actively engage in competitive sportsmanship to prove their manhood and nothing more.  There will be no vulgarity or arguments about strategy and coaching acumen.  Just the friendly, but fierce battle.  Just as it was meant to be by our forefathers who started the game in the late 1800's.<br />And how do you end a perfect trip to West Point?  By driving away and watching the remaining West Point  tailgaters wave with a smile on their face as they await the next day they will line up for another fierce, but friendly battle.<br />Oh, Memphis won.  But that's not important.s pass the grandstand.  Civilians are instructed in proper etiquette as the parade builds to the playing of the national anthem and presenting of the colors.

This book is about the Gold Club as seen through this lady and about the life of Ms. Bush.  But I'm not sure she is capable of giving anything but a very narrow viewpoint.<br />Ms. Bush describes herself as the top dancer and most beautiful woman that everyone falls in love with.  Well, from the looks of the picture, she was not one of the most beautiful.  Evidently she had a good relationship with the owner and began to use this trump card as she openly challenged the local manager.  The book is all about her and how everyone loved or hated her.  And of course, she didn't perform any sex acts but she knew who to include from the other dancers if that was needed.  As it relates to the Gold Club and the legal proceedings, this book does not offer compelling evidence of guilt although written from a lady with minimal educational training, it's difficult to know what she is trying to convey other than, \\"I'm the Greatest\\". She does however manage to drop some names, athletes and other assorted celebrities, which will satisfy some readers.<br />In addition to detail of the Gold Club, Ms. Bush thought we would be interested in her life story.  It's not only not interesting, it's depressing and helps to document what many people view as a stripper stereotype.  Her mother is a drug addict.  Father is a womanizing wife beater.  She marries young and has kids.  Leaves her husband after he becomes a womanizing wife-beater and then must take care of her kids on her own.  She drifts into stripping and the rest is history.<br />This is not a literary masterpiece.  And frankly, it's not a good retelling of the fascinating history of the Gold Club.  It's an opportunity for Ms. Bush to retell her story and have her 15 minutes of fame and I guess I have no problem with that.  But you probably shouldn't waste your money on it unless you have some specific interest in the Gold Club or Ms. Bush.e some specific interest in the Gold Club or Ms. Bush.	2003-05-07

Sandy Weill's recent biography comes to mind as a personal favorite. Since Tom Weisel is an exceptional athlete with many interests similar to mine, I thought I would enjoy this read. Frankly, it's very painful.<br />First of all, the two-page summary at the end of each chapter written by Weisel would have been a great framework around which to write a biography. But the actual chapters read like a paid self-promotion or someone in the throes of hero-worship. The author consistently talks of what a great athlete Weisel is while making sure he mentions that Weisel never brags about his athletic prowess. No need to given that the writer will glorify the results. Even concerning business the writer manages to find a positive in every event. For example, the original partners split up and start a competing firm but there is no attempt to mention if Weisel's faults could have had any impact. Of course, per this book, he has no faults.<br />Weisel eventually merges the successful but controversial Montgomery Securities into Nationsbank but after trumpeting this as a great deal, it merges poorly so blame is completely placed on Nationsbank. Now, of course anyone living this large competitive life must trade-in for a 24-year-old trophy wife when he is 49. Unfortunately there is never a significant mention of the break-up of his first marriage other than what a great father he is and how involved he is with all his kids.<br />This book is so filled with braggadocio that if Weisel were really interested in keeping the profile of a respected businessman, he would have done his best to limit his exposure to this book. Tom Weisel may very well be a great man but great men do not need to have this much said about them in this forum. I'm shocked he agreed to allow his name to be included in this work, as it is not becoming.	2003-05-07

I found this book to be lightly written in that there is not much depth in any subject.  While there are many business stories, they really provide nothing insightful not covered from reading business periodicals.  This does give a complete history of Mr. Levy's family and his entry in Wall Street but there is really nothing compelling there except that his dad was an economist and this shaped Mr. Levy's career through the years.<br />This is not a bad book and it was quite easy to read.

While I think the father intended it's focus to be about his relationship with his son, the son's in-depth narrative of boot camp and his transformation into a Marine were much more touching to me.<br />As to the father-son relationship, this is the tale of a loving father who is losing his son as he grows to a man.  And this really starts before he enters the Marines as he becomes more attached to a girl of whom the father does not approve...When the son John enters boot camp, the real excitement starts as you live through the experience with him.  The brainwashing of these recruits seems extreme until you watch these recruits grow into the type Marines the DIs wanted.  I'm not sure I could survive the mental and physical effects of boot camp and anyone who has passed boot camp is to be commended. It's interesting to watch these guys struggle the last few weeks with injuries that should be treated but would only delay the recruit's training.<br />After boot camp, the book then shows the negative of the military.  This motivated recruit is sent for Morse Code training for 4 months only to be sidelined for over a year, as his security clearance has not been processed in Washington. What a waste of taxpayer money and young people's lives.  But even this demeaning treatment does not shake the extreme pride in the Corp.<br />Probably the most important lesson of this book is how a son from an upper-middle class family chooses a career in the Marines while suffering the ridicule of the liberal friends of his parents and how his father's attitude changes about this.  I felt this could have been covered in more depth.  More importantly, this recruit bonds with the fully integrated Marines and learns to share many experiences with most other recruits less fortunate.<br />I strongly recommend this book to learn more of one of our greatest natural resources, the men and women who choose to serve in the military.  The most heart-wrenching part of this book is seeing the stories of Marines with families who qualify for food stamps.

Unless you're in the biz, which I'm not, almost all of the names will be unfamiliar.  This book has no story.  It's a known fact that a way into the entertainment industry is to work in an agency's mailroom, eat sh*t, and hope for your break.  This book is a series of interviews with the former mailroom attendees on the good, the bad, and the mental make-up of the wannabes struggling to get out of \\"mailroom jail\\".  It's funny, informative, and one of those books you can't put down.<br />Many industries have a proving ground.  In investment banking we put them on as a trading or sales assistant hoping they will pick up the lingo and learn on the fly.  But the agency mailroom seems to be about feeding egos of senior agent's with much more screaming, yelling and attention paid to personal chores.  They do mention many of the nice agents as well as the agents who were best at teaching the mailroom guys.  My favorite stories are about CAA because it is next door to my favorite hotel the Peninsula and because of the Mike Ovitz aura.  Mike doesn't come off particularly well in the book but partner Ron Meyer does come off as a particularly sharp and nice guy.<br />The positives and negatives of the mailroom run from taking your bosses stool sample in the doctor to having nude actresses answer the door.  I also enjoyed the stories of the CAA mailroom which had a particularly high level of paranoia.  I had met media mogul and former agent, Mike Medavoy so it was interesting seeing his son's quotes who was eventually fired due to information leaked to his father.<br />If you have any interest in the business side of Hollywood, you'll like this book.  Other books of interest would be \\"Wannabe\\" about an MBA's attempt to succeed at the low levels of Hollywood, and Lynda Obst's book \\"Hello, He Lied\\" about her journey from journalist to producer.	2003-03-28

The coverage in this book is exceptional.  As discussed, investment-banking firms are ripe with potential for sexual discrimination.  Partly because so many areas work on trading floors which breed a fraternity type atmosphere, partly because stock brokers tend to be fraternity/salesmen type guys, and partly because this environment has assistants, many who are women, working in close contact with these who sometimes consider themselves \\"masters of the universe.\\"  Confidence/cockiness is never in short supply at an investment banking firm's trading floor.<br />The first part of the book lays out the environment where sexual discrimination was prevalent.  It's so clearly offensive that it's amazing there wasn't a larger settlement in this case.  But this is where the book greatly details the unique twist in the case.  The protagonist goes through two lawyers and watches as her lawyer and the opposing lawyer seem to become more in agreement than her and her lawyer.  Eventually she's dropped from the settlement even though her name still appears on the class action suit. So while I thought I was a reading a sexual discrimination, the book turned into attorney/client relationships and attorney greed in class action cases.<br />Do I think the attorneys became more concerned about their large fee than their client?  Yes.  Do I think the original client could be difficult to deal with?  Yes.  But the outcome is tragic and no one got what he or she deserved.  Justice was not monetarily served for the defendants in my opinion.  I strongly recommend this book if you have interest in investment banking, law or women's issues.	2003-03-16

I like business biographies and specifically those concerning investment banking.  Sandy Weill's career is so diverse with so many companies turned around that this book is the best I have read in detailing a man's lifetime case study. For those who may not be familiar with Sandy Weill, he started on Wall Street with a small firm as Wall Street was struggling with sheer back-office paperwork and quickly grew that into a force challenging Merrill Lynch.  After a merger with American Express, Weill was eventually forced out.  He returned to corporate management buying a Baltimore finance company in trouble, Commercial Credit.  After merging with Travelers Insurance, Weill eventually merges with Citicorp creating the largest financial institution in the world.<br />What makes this book interesting are the character flaws of Sandy Weill.  While he has strengths in cost cutting efficiency, he has many management flaws.  Temper management, delegation of authority, public speaking are but a few of the flaws detailed in this book.  Of particular interest is his relationship with Jamie Dimon, his long-time younger prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who is eventually let go and now runs Bank One.<br />There is one complaint I have with this book.  At the takeover of Commercial Credit, there are significant discussions of the changes in management philosophy that are quite interesting.  But after significant work and allusion of improvement, no report of financial performance was provided to demonstrate mathematically how positive the improvement was.  Obviously, it was significant given the mergers that took place after the turnaround of Commercial Credit.<br />I must compliment the author on a thorough research job.  It was clear from the dialog that this book would have been impossible without interviews with many different people including Sandy Weill.  I did not find this book tipped to Weill's favor as a &quot;fluff&quot; piece but rather I thought the author balanced the good with the bad.<br />In summary, if you like business summaries dealing with finance you will like this book./>In summary, if you like business summaries dealing with finance you will like this book.	2003-03-16

What Chuck Barris projected on \\"The Gong Show\\" is projected in this book.  He has minimal attention span and his mind works in mysterious ways. Barris is significant to Pop Culture by lowering the standards of our television viewing.<br />While Chuck Barris is most famous for \\"The Gong Show\\", his other inventions, \\"The Dating Game\\" and \\"The Newlywed Game\\" have stood the test of time better.  For those who haven't seen the Gong Show, it was a prelude to Johnny Knoxville and reality TV, i.e., the worst that TV has to offer.  Now admittedly I watched it and sometimes enjoyed the comic appeal of the train wreck.  The book also mentions the early success with Dating and Newlywed shows which allowed him to grow his ego into the disastrous Gong Show.<br />As a biography, this book just touches the high points, TV Producer with bad long-term romantic relationships.  Obviously the book has been rediscovered based upon his claims of being a CIA spy. Not just a spy but also a hit man.  I'm sorry but it is so unbelievable that to even guess to its validity as some have done is incredulous.  It would be too easy to track some documentation to his involvement.  There is a lady agent who is mentioned and pictured in the book that could easily be tracked if this were true as well as his initial supervisor who was killed. What you have is what the title says, \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\\".  The guy has a great imagination and wrote a book partly autobiographical with great fiction on top.<br />After a short slow period getting into the story, I found the book interesting and funny.  At one point I was in an airport suppressing laughter.  But by the last 75 pages, the story slowed to a crawl.  He didn't like his job producing. His relationships are terrible.  Let's go kill someone to spice up the book.  I would add that the ending does provide a plot twist I was not expecting and did enjoy.<br />In summary, I'm neither glad nor sad that I read this book.  It was somewhat interesting but dated and may not be worth your time unless you have a specific interest in Chuck Barris or Pop Culture in America in the 60s/70s.  Now, if you like the ranting of a deranged mind........summary, I'm neither glad nor sad that I read this book.

This book tried to say too much and failed to simply tell its story.<br />A Mexican American is murdered in an apparent car jacking.  Every member of his family is then summarized whether ultimately significant to where the author is taking the story or not.  The victim's brother is a high ranking DEA officer who becomes obsessed with this horrible death and whether it has anything to do with his position.  Various family member's lives are ruined over this crime.<br />But where this book failed is trying to tell too many stories.  We jump from one family member to an overview of America's view of the drug war, to politicians in Mexico, to family member of the shooter, etc., etc.  On and on it goes with as many as three different subplots discussed on many different pages.  Finally after 60 pages of information bombardment from different points of view, I scanned the rest of the book reading the follow-up of the murder and scanning the macro view of the drug war and Mexico and USA's strategies.<br />Based upon the poor organization, I do not recommend this book to learn about the compelling history of the fight against drugs.  Review my Book Reviews from the past two years to see many books which effectively covered interesting stories of this battle...	2003-02-24

Does it tell stories of all different type games, blackjack, sports books, horseracing, poker?  Yes, this book gives a good overview of gambling and interesting stories to entertain the reader.<br />And that is it in a nutshell.  I am not a big gambler but casually enjoyed this book.  But I have a complaint.  The title.  The first story in the book is about the guy who had breast implants to win a $100,000 bet even though the story alludes to it being more of a dare than an actual bet.  A picture is included and I assure you it's not fun to look at.  My problem is the sensationalized title when it's less than 15% of the book.<br />I was referred this book by Amazon after reading Bringing Down the House, a story of MIT students who card count their way to millions.  I strongly recommend that book for an interesting gambling story.  The reviews for this book were very good so I decided to try it. If you have an interest in gambling, you'll enjoy this book.  But it's probably only for people for whom gambling is a significant interest in their life.	2003-02-24

Knowing no history of Motown and it's beginning, it's interesting to hear the stories of Berry's very diligent family and their involvement in his company.  It's a typical entrepreneurial story of a guy with an idea that sees a market that his unique talent can fill.  Most aren't successful but with hard work, luck and talent, Motown is successful.  It should be noted that his success is even more impressive in the civil rights environment of the late 50s/early 60s when Berry was starting his firm.<br />The book does a great job of detailing Berry's techniques that lead to the success of Motown.  In addition, individual artists, producers and writers are highlighted and their stories overlapped with the Motown story.  If you like this music or grew up in this era, the names will all be recognizable.<br />The final two chapters deal with Motown's foray into movies and the ultimate demise.  I was not aware of their movie involvement and it's comical how Berry backed into the business and then makes all the mistakes people with too much money make when they are touched by movie magic.  Finally, the music magic has gone, Berry's interest has waned, and an exciting new company is consistently getting beaten in the marketplace probably due to poor management.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you have any interest in music, the culture of the 60s, or any pop music stars who recorded in the 60s.  As to others complaints, they may be more knowledgeable of the Motown experience but I'm glad I read this book to learn more.	2003-02-12

The author interviews these investors with similar summary questions.  Generally, he tracked their history of how they got into the investment business, how they developed their philosophy, a summary of how they analyze stocks, and any insight they would like to add about their approach.  With the questions being similar to each manager, you are able to compare unique journeys by which the investors ended up as value investors.  Most of the managers were very similar in their belief that investors have internal philosophies about value investing and you either get it or you don't.  But the paths taken by the managers into investing were all different.  It was very intriguing that not many grew up wanting to be value investors but rather in many cases just fell into it.<br />As a proponent of value investing I did not find a particular analytical tool that will change my evaluation method.  But I did see how different managers could look at the same problem and see different outcomes.  In addition, I heavily marked specific passages to refer back. I intend to research some of the investors in further depth and track changes in their portfolios looking for ideas.<br />I'm surprised the book was so poorly received by so many.  I learned quite a bit, found the format to be helpful and look forward to following these investors in more depth.  I've come to the conclusion that there is no book that answers all the questions novice stock investors may have but rather it is a slow journey where you pick up investing nuggets along the way.	2003-02-12

I graduated from high school in 71 and my interest in sports overlaid Cosell's rise to prominence.<br />This book is good and bad.  The bad part is that Howard writes it and therefore Howard covers only what he wants.  He picks out about 5 themes and covers the story from his perspective while overlaying his importance and how these events may have led to his eventually leaving network sports.  For example, the first quarter of the book is an in-depth analysis of the Raiders leaving Los Angeles and Al Davis' fight with the NFL.  Howard does a good job covering this issue from an intelligent standpoint but feels compelled to consistently drop names and inform you of his importance in the story.  The most compelling part of this subject, which is further covered later with the section on the Jets and Giants leaving New York, is how it plays out in today's culture of sports franchises still successfully blackmailing cities and states.  At least in that perspective, Howard was correct.<br />In addition to NFL franchise moves, the other big story is NFL Monday Night Football.  Fans today have no idea how big this was for football to be carried on the weeknight.  Howard Cosell was perfect for the role.  He was clearly the most hated man in America.  Brass, cocky, controversial but always wanting to open his mouth and have everyone listens to him.  My fondest memories of Monday Night Football is Don Meredith and his comedy.  It was worth watching just to listen to Don.  Frank Gifford was the ballast, the middleman compromise between Frank and Don who made everything run smoothly.  Howard was like the nerd who never fit in but felt like he needed to lead the show.  And actually he was pretty good at it at times.  Eventually Howard self-implodes.  Struggling because all the print media hates him, his partners don't like him, but self-delusionally believing it's everyone else's fault, he asks to be removed from the show.  And with this change, Howard leaves the spotlight but doesn't seem to ever get comfortable without the light on him.<br />Howard was an intelligent, complex man who had a huge desire to be loved.  Probably what he should be known for most is his complete devotion to his wife.  When she died in the mid-90s, Howard was just lost.  Basically his life was over except for dying.<br />Other stories covered in this book are his reason for walking away from boxing coverage as well as his personal history with Ali, Ray Leonard and O.J. Simpson. In summary, this is a book of stories that are interesting to Howard, not a biography.  But it does give good insight into the man.  I recommend this book for anyone with interest in sports, the 70s, or television history.everyone else's fault, he asks to be removed from the show.

The main character is a small-town midwestern, lower-middle class graduate who gets a coveted job as a research analyst on Wall Street. Unfortunately he discovers it's a 70 hour a week job with major pressure which the author goes in to detail describing.<br />Equipped with the 1/2 million pay and the beautiful, perfect uppercrust girlfriend, the analyst's world starts to unravel when he agrees to an interview about his career with one of his girlfriend's snooty, uppercrust literary friends.<br />I found the author's writing style to be somewhat distracting.  He seemed to take 40 words to convey what could be said in ten.  For that reason, I struggled through the first third of the book as he set up the story.  But the interview by an aspiring author with the investment banker is such a classic battle of two forces who alternatively ridicule and envy each other.<br />But the inexperienced banker is in over his head and totally exposed by the interviewer.  Among the regretted quotes he regrets is that a half million dollar income is necessary to score a piece of ... like his current girlfriend.  Obviously, not the type comment you share with a rival, particularly if he is a journalist.<br />While this duel of words is fascinating and forces the investment banker to evaluate his self-worth, the book quickly collapses after the buildup of the interview.  The ending becomes somewhat ambiguous and once again collapses under the weight of so many words to describe simple emotions.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the great conflict of the interview.  But it's questionable whether this is enough enjoyment for the whole book.  As a disclosure, I am an investment banker not in the equity area.  The author was a former assistant equity analyst with Goldman Sachs.	2003-01-02

I like to read business stories.  The author's goal was to teach the reader about investing in bankrupt companies and the method used was with detailed narratives of past deals.  This was perfect for what I wanted.<br />The book went into great detail about the hierarchy of security claims and how they work in bankruptcy.  The examples showed how the investor classes work with and against each other in bankruptcy and the roles the b/k judge and attorneys played.  With many different narratives the reader is able to see different outcomes and the extreme risks and rewards involved in this type investing.<br />The book's main focus was on the personalities involved in buying distressed debt and then trying to influence the b/k process mainly through the courts but sometimes in prepackaged b/ks.<br />In summary, I learned a lot and enjoyed the stories also.  The only caveat I would have is that the book was originally written in the early 90s so there are not new examples although the author did give summary updates on the companies and investors up through 1998.	2003-01-02

After a break-in and related embezzelment wipes out his savings, Jimmy has to scramble to not end up as a homeless man on the street.  But a homeless man becomes his savior in his darkest hour.<br />See how Jimmy balances his bar, daughter by a divorced wife (you can tell the author really has a kid and is divorced), minimal lovelife and madcap friends at the bar to get to a happy ending.<br />The best part of this book is the humourous writing tone.  The one-liners happen so quickly you really have to pay attention.<br />But alas, everything is not perfect.  The Dice Angel is not introduced till over half the book is over and she seems to be brought in just to close the story happily.  Also, there are a lot of loose ends.  Significant time is spent with his daughter but it's only a subplot.  The crime has a villan but the book starts after his action and he is only described rather than developed through interaction.<br />This is a light, enjoyable book to read.  But the action is somewhat stale and there are no pages that bring you to the edge of your chair.  It's just...... enjoyable.  And maybe that's enough.	2002-12-10

In that respect, I did enjoy this book. For example, the Rockefeller kids did not attend an exclusive private grade school. Obviously, his life was still very different from most Americans filled with travel and meeting very famous, intelligent people.<br />After a very interesting educational career and time served in WWII, Rockefeller works initially as an assistant to the Mayor of NY but eventually begins a long career with Chase Manhattan Bank ending as the Chairman. Here, the book really bogged down. Even though he was raised in a life much different than most Americans, his Chase career was marked by a rivalry with a senior loan officer in a battle for the top spot at the bank. Rockefeller spent this part of the book describing the battle in depth without trying to be critical. Frankly, it was more information than was needed and not really becoming. After his ascension to the top spot, the book describes in detail, probably too much detail, his growth of the bank, his relationships with world leaders, and the problems at the bank that almost cost him his job. And possibly it should have.<br />The book ends with Rockefeller reflecting on his philanthropic activities and the ultimate dispostion of the Rockefeller Center. I found this section quite interesting.<br />Overall, I casually enjoyed this book and would recommend it. But it is real time commitment to read and may be considered too boring for many readers. If you are buying this book because you enjoy business biographies, I would not recommend the book as there is no compelling story to tell from a business perspective. It's just a story of a wonderful life from a very wealthy individual who is able to travel in very high circles.	2002-11-29

This is my first Pat Conroy book although I have seen two movies from his books, Santini and Prince of Tides. The Great Santini I enjoyed immensely.<br />Conroy is a brilliant writer who weaves many sentences with excellent descriptions and analogies. While I grade his writing style highly, I was originally attracted to the book for the story line as I thoroughly enjoy basketball. But while this book is centered on basketball that is only the spine around which this book is developed. This is a story of the growth of Conroy with many subplots: life at Citadel and the murderous Plebe system, his complicated family life particularly with his father, his meager love life and his early development as a writer.<br />But, as always, character development is critical to a great book and in addition to Conroy, we see his interaction with teammates and coaches. In fact, it is a comment from one of his teammates who years later provokes the idea of this book of supposed \\"losers\\".<br />Conroy writes without an ego and clearly he is a better player than he describes. But after 3/4 of the book, it's rewarding when Conroy visits the aged teammates to find out how their lives have developed. Particularly his coach and one role player for whom all readers will have a high degree of respect for his sacrifices. While I enjoyed the whole book, the most touching passages are of his trips to the Vietnam Wall and the story of the student team manager, Rat.<br />READ THIS BOOK. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I read books for enjoyment or to learn. I enjoyed the story and marveled at the superb writing. I learned a great deal about Conroy and his life and influences. And I also visualized my life and whether I will have the great memories and be touched by so many wonderful teachers and friends.<br />ADDENDUM:  The book had kind words for Jerry West who worked at a camp with Conroy. I met West and asked had he read the book as it had kind words of him.  He considers Conroy a good friend and had read the book.  He also mentioned that Tom Clancy had come through the camp as well.  I guess basketball and authors are a great combination.nd had read the book.  He also mentioned that Tom Clancy had come through the camp as well.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	5	4	10	N	Y	Fast, Furious and Fun	A book needs a great story or a great storyteller.  This is a GREAT story by a good storyteller.  The book is about a group of MIT students who card count their way to a fortune.  The author does a great job framing what is involved in the game of blackjack taking the reader through higher levels of complexity so the reader will understand the math even if you do not gamble.<br />Without telling the story, a team of MIT geeks descends on Vegas using a unique code of signals to hide who is the big gambler of the group.  Quickly these MIT geeks are corrupted by the life of sin in Vegas although they do keep their eye on the ball and rake in the money.<br />But nothing lasts forever and the team faces internal issues as well as the casinos increased efforts to stop card counters.  This book is a fast read loaded with action.  I highly recommend this book particularly if you have any interest in gambling or Vegas.	2002-10-19

But if you are reading this to learn about Amazon, that's only part of the story.  <br />Mike Daisey is the ultimate slacker and proud of it.  Raised in rural Maine, Daisy migrates to Seattle after a liberal arts degree specializing in acting.  This is not the type guy who ends up as the next Mel Gibson but rather he's working his acting gig in garages in Seattle.  Obviously this type career will require money from natural sources, real jobs.  <br />After a distinguished career in the temporary services industry, Daisey latches on to the Customer Service dept. at Amazon.com.  Keep in mind this is the early stages of the company with massive software problems.  This required lying and tap-dancing by the Customer Service representatives.  While some may be uniquely qualified for this job, Daisey was not and during this frustrating period was rescued with a job in business development, clearly a step up.  <br />While this job put him closer to the heat of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon icon, the Internet hype days were quickly ending.  Daisey was caught in the trap and lost his job.  How he describes this wild ride from slacker, to Amazon brainwashed devotee, back to normal slacker is a humorous story of our times.  I recommend this book for anyone interested in Amazon, the Internet culture or youngsters coming of age in the 90's.	2002-10-15

My only knowledge of Janice Dickinson was that she supposedly had Sly Stallone's child and there was some type scandal.  I bought this book because I love beautiful women and biographies about the fast life in the 70s.  This book satisfies on both counts. Not only is Janice beautiful but also virtually every other supermodel till the 90s is mentioned or pictured in the book.<br />Janice describes her destructive family life and through the typical desire and luck worms her way into the modeling business.  Still only on the fringes of the business, she describes her European trips and how she is finally able to generate the heat necessary to grow into a supermodel.  Of course, this leads to the failed marriages, self-destructive life style including sex and drugs, and an attitude to eventually hurt her career.<br />But this wild life makes an interesting read even though it is lightly written.<br />A second part of the book deals with life after modeling, her final two marriages, birth of her kids, her Stallone affair and the death of her father.  It's almost sad at this point to see a person who had it all and how she had so many problems living happily.  But that's the interesting part of the book seeing how she copes.<br />Some of us are built to go to work every day.  And some, like Janice are built to live on the edge and reach for the stars.

Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line	Books	4	11	12	N	Y	The short version of how movies are made	I like books on Hollywood biz and this one fits the bill by a real pro, Art Linson.  Anyone involved with classics like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Fight Club and Heat knows his way around the business and how it has changed in the last 30 years.  Linson throws one kink in the normal Hollywood tell-all.  He introduces a fictitious former studio head that has lunches with Linson generating a lively dialog of the business by to former players.<br />While I enjoyed this book, I have one major complaint.  There are only four Hollywood stories in the book.  It's like Linson has found his hit and can issue many sequels so he does so little at a time.  The book is only 180 pages and is a very fast read.  Also, the stories are not in great depth.  For example, he describes the movie The Edge with Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins.  He does a good job describing how these two are selected and the great respect he has for both actors.  But the story line quickly ends as Baldwin shows up overweight and with a long beard.  Linson has to deliver the bad news that he must change his appearance.  End of story.  Let's move on to the next.<br />While this story is anticlimactic after a flirtation with Robert Deniro in the movie, I like Linson's writing style for the subjects.  It's short, uncomplicated and humorous.  Other stories covered include Pushing Tin, Great Expectations and The Fight Club.  All interesting stories but all written about very briefly.<br />Irrespective, I still recommend this book if you enjoy reading Hollywood stories.  Linson had a great career and I'm sure there is another book coming in the future.	2002-10-15

A great title for a book that enticed this sucker to buy it.  But really the book is nothing but a general examination of investment theory. Let me save you the purchase of the book.  You can't beat the market and studies prove if you try you will waste too much money in brokerage comissions.  How depressing!!!<br />And who are these rich and famous?  They are nowhere to be found.  He does have a chapter of famous losers like Nick Leeson who broke an English bank and Robert Citron who bankrupted Orange County California.  But that is as close as you get to this misleading title.<br />About the only positive I found in this book was an in-depth study of investor's behavioral patterns.  Overall, I'd recommend you pass on this book.	2002-10-15

But did we really need this much information?  Epstein divides the book into two parts, history of snobbery and most common snob objects,ie, colleges, clubs, children's acheivements, etc.  This is a good book for self-evaluating your tendancies of snobbery as he hits so many different subjects.  Viewed from this self-analysis theme, this book is worth the read.  But generally, the book drones on as the author attempts to fill the standard page quota of about 250 pages.<br />Although I may not have needed it, I did learn a good history of snobbery particularly as it relates to the continent.  I also learned Epstein's well-stated theory that the WASP culture of snobbery was substantially reduced in the 60s with the growing counter-culture.  In the second section he overlayed American snob tendancies particularly in clothing, clubs and education.  In many respects, I agree with him completely.<br />This would be a difficult subject to tackle and Epstein at least admits some of his snob tendancies very early.  I think this book demonstrates that everyone has some snob tendancies.  But the book could be more concise and eventually the reader may tire of the information learned but stretched to fill space.	2002-10-10

A significant part of the book covers the buildup to the war.  Since I don't have a clear knowledge of Israeli history, I really wished he had given an overview further back.  But from WWII forward, it provides a great perspective.<br />This book demonstrates the exhaustive diplomatic work that went on in this engagement.  From reading this book, I'm surprised the historical perspective of how close Russia and the US could have been to war has not been more widely publicized.  Egypt clearly sent messages to Russia that they expected actual involvement if America sent forces.  And Israel did the same to America.<br />Egypt invaded United Nations controlled territory first but clearly Israel was the \\"1st strike\\" war aggressor.  This book clearly demonstrates the importance of first strike cannot be understated.  The Egyptian Air Force was destroyed in the first day.  Does that validate starting the armed confrontation?  Clearly, the Israeli side would say yes.  Egypt did blockade waterways so there may have been good justification.<br />Probably the historical event most surprising was the attack on an American spy ship by the Israelis.  As I was too young to know of the incident, I'm surprised at this gross error by Israel that caused American lives.  Reading of this incident alone makes the purchase of this book worthwhile.<br />In summary, I would say this book provides an excellent historical framework of the importance of this war both in the Middle East and the world at large.  It also examines the political framework in each of the countries.  If you read world news at all, you'll recognize the names in this book as they continue to reign, particularly in Israel.	2002-09-26

While Maier's book is not an in-depth detailed book, it projects Cramer as an egotistical tyrannical trader.  Reading this book for a comparison, you can believe both sides of the story.  Cramer recounts many of the same stories and they are remarkably similar but from different perspectives.  For example, they both wrote about the birthday party where Cramer became extremely intoxicated and puked on the guests.  Maier describes this as another example of Cramer's poor manners and ego.  Cramer describes the bad day he had had and where he was mentally that had him over drink and embarrass his family.  If anything, I was surprised that an egomaniac like Cramer could admit to any shortcomings.  Many \\"Masters of the Universe\\" can't.<br />Cramer doesn't strike me as a charismatic guy.  But you have to be impressed with where he started and where he ended up.  Maybe his tactics were questionable.  But to compete in the money arena with the fortunes at stake, it is impressive that he was able to even be on the field and favorably compete at least for a few years.<br />There are two significant relationships in the book I feel compelled to mention.  First the investor who Cramer met who not only invested but recommended investors.  This also turned out to be the relationship that Maier knew to get his job.  A partnership was formed to set up TheStreet.com and somehow in the personnel problems of the venture, Cramer had a falling out with his favored investor that appeared to eventually leading to the shutdown of the hedge fund.  You can sense from hearing Cramer's side that there is another side to the story.  Cramer doesn't place blame but you can sense that he probably upset many people in his new business venture.  It is an interesting case study listening to the different CEOs that are hired and how in Cramer's opinion they ruined the business.<br />Also, Cramer talks extensively about the relationship with his wife.  She was also a stock trader and at different points in his career, she comes back to assist with trading.  This part of the book shows just how emotional and psychological trading can be.  Cramer would be a tough guy to live with and being married to another trader who understood the environment and the egos involved would make for a volatile relationship.  I'd like to know more of the dynamics of that relationship but I suspect she is a real saint, as it appears to work well.<br />In summary, this book gives some background on what it is like in the rough and tumble world of Wall Street during a very unique trading period.  Cramer is a self-promoter who successfully promoted himself into a high profile media job and therefore has some celebrity status.  But the real story is the egos of people in this business and what they have to do to be successful and how they can live with some of their egotistical tendencieser talks extensively about the relationship with his wife.

I prefer the war stories but this book does a very good job in it's &quot;how to&quot; section being very careful to not let the reader get bored.<br />Peter Bart, who appears to do 80% of the writing, does an excellent job describing what is involved in doing a deal.  It lets a nonindustry person realize why some movies are made that turn out to be bad movies.  The bottom line is there is a process, a &quot;Hollywood dance&quot; so to speak, that is how deals progress. Many outsiders have talked about changing Hollywood to a more standard business environment.  It will never happen.  Too much history to change and frankly, with the creative people involved, they probably couldn't work in that environment.  Disney has tried to shift the process with some success but the negative press does keep some creative people from working with them.<br />Peter Bart provides many war stories from the 1970s with Guber has more current stories given his success as a producer.  I expected this book to be similar to Mike Medavoy's biography of his movie career.  It wasn't.  But it was still very good and would recommend it.	2002-08-16

If nothing else, this book will show you the &quot;inside&quot; money game played on a very large scale that is virtually unknown to mainstream America.<br />Lowenstein does an exceptional job tracing the history of the principals from Salomon and how their unique culture grew into a monster where the traders felt they could do nothing wrong. And that's always the reason rational money managers eventually take large losses as the market can surprise even the pros.<br />Having left Salomon under a cloud of disgrace, Meriwether desperately wanted back in the game.  While this book does an excellent job describing the complex arbitrage trades LTCM was running, readers should be aware it is a complex subject that you may not understand. The author shows the transition from complex trades that generate small profits to a borrowing machine intent on making this small profit on ever larger leveraged money.  And that's a recipe for disaster IF the markets remain irrational for an extended length of time.  And that's exactly what happened, the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of financial disasters.<br />But that storm was helped by two factors.  First, by being so cocky in their dealings with their bankers, when they needed the help from a friendly hand, there was none as everyone silently rooted for the failure of the 800 pound gorilla.  In addition, as their problem became larger and they entered negotiations with various parties for a bailout, these parties were able to unload their own holdings of these unprofitable positions in front of LTCM compounding the loss until final capitulation.<br />What may be of most interest to casual market followers is Warren Buffett's role in the attempted bailout.  He makes a bid for the company at the very last minute but on terms that you would never accept unless you were forced to, the ulitmate value buy with limited loss exposure.  It must be nice to be the only guy with enough money to be the ultimate bidder.<br />In the current market upheaval of 2002, casual investors with losses may also be comforted by watching the brillant financial minds who overleveraged and didn't diversify, lose their massive fortunes like so many others in America.<br />In summary, this is an excellent about a complex subject.  My compliments to the author on an excellent research job where the information was not required to be communicated.  He was able to piece together not only the events as seen from the outside, but also a good feel for what LTCM was doing and their strengths and weaknesses.at you would never accept unless you were forced to, the ulitmate value buy with limited loss exposure.

This book will definitely please climbers as it covers this climbing legend's life from how she got into climbing, to her experiences growing up as a climber in Yosemite, to her triumphs in competitive climbing.<br />But it also covers much more like the problems a female must conquer in the male climbing world. Some of my favorite parts were the stories in Yosemite and the many other great climbers she climbed with and the bond they shared. As with every climbing book, if enough climbers are introduced, you will encounter the climbers that are not living when the book is written due to accidents.<br />This book also delves deeply into who Lynn Hill is. Mainly concerning her relationships, both climbing and romantic, many of which have tragic endings. The book starts by describing her worst fall and clearly demonstrates how lucky she was to survive. But to me the most introspective part of the book is her feelings of high altitude mountaineering. This was not her speciality and the book deals with why she stayed out of this arena and how uncomfortable she was in what high altitude climbing she did.<br />A true climber's book. I recommend this book if you enjoy rock climbing.	2002-08-16

But when you are a \\"spotlight hound\\" who likes the advantages of being famous but doesn't feel he should have to live with the negatives, how creditable can the story be?<br />I play lots of tennis and remain a big fan of his artistry on the tennis courts.  But let's be honest.  The only reason Mac stopped playing tennis is the game evolved beyond his abilities.  There are few serve/volley players because the game is based on power now.  Mac did not have great power.  It was sad to watch Mac play Lendl in the late 80s expecting a compelling duel when what you saw was Mac unable to handle the consistent pace of Lendl's power.<br />But unlike many players, Mac was more than just a player.  He attended private school through one year at Stanford.  And while still a pro, he developed a deep interest in art by touring various museums around the world.<br />Then there is the other side of Mac which occupies significant space in the book.  Mac the musician.  Here he uses his celebrity to play guitar poorly with famous people.  While I'm sure this is quite a rush, he eventually forms his own band that does some minor touring.  But his budding music career comes to an abrupt halt.  He continues to bug his musician/wife Patty Smythe to sing with his band.  When she finally agrees, Mac walks out in the crowd playing his guitar effectively taking the spotlight off the true artist, his wife.  At least he's willing to put this story in his book showing how badly he needs the spotlight.<br />Mac does talk extensively of his celebrity status and the advantages it allowed him.  In our current pop culture this may be the most interesting part to people who don't closely follow tennis.  While Mac may have thought he was writing a compelling intelligent biography, it will always remain known for the publicity is generated by his statements of wife Tatum O'Neal and her televised response.<br />In summary, Mac is a very good tennis television commentator and a former great player.  He also is a celebrity who needs the stage.  But Mac, your time was over in the 80s.  Time to move on and writing a book about yourself justifying why you whine on the tennis court doesn't quite cut.  I'm glad I read this book, as I'm a big tennis fan.  But Mac's highest and best use is a challenge match against one of the Williams sisters.  He's become Bobby Riggs.

While in the middle of a climb, the climbers are forced down at gunshot.  They live the next 10 days in a series of firefights with death all around them.  To make their struggle even tougher, there is little food and the climbers are forced to bed down during hours of light in very cramped quarters.  The climbers are aware they are in desparate straits as the kidnappers execute a soldier while in the middle of a gun fight.  Eventually the climbers escape but that's only half the story.<br />Their story is so unbelievable and information is so unreliable that their credibility is severely questioned.  This book goes into detail about this controversy and I think does an excellent job of showing how it developed. ...<br />Based on the controversy you're either going to believe the story or not.  To me, it's very believable.  The climber characters are classic young Americans and the author does a great job portraying their close relationships and this eventually cracks.  I stongly recommend this book if you like climbing or stories of adventure.	2002-06-02

I'm not a big believer that shorts squeeze companies nearly as much as long investors like to claim so I hoped to learn from the source.<br />Frankly, I'm disappointed for two reasons.  First of all, Mr. Asensio doesn't really give good examples of selling short stock as an investment strategy EXCEPT as it relates to small overly promoted fraudulent stocks.  I had hoped to learn financial analysis of when a stock should be shorted.  Instead, this book focuses only on overly hyped companies run by stock promoters.  Fair enough.  But the positions in these smaller companies would be much harder to short.  In addition, Mr. Asensio may have the time to study the small stocks and uncover these unethical stocks, but it's really not pertinent to the average investor and therefore had minimal value to me.<br />My second problem with the book is the grandioise self-serving nature of the narrative.  Ok, the writer is from Cuba, works his way into the investing business but never feels like he's part of the \\"club\\".  So he sticks it in their ear by being a short seller. But there is always an explanation about the bad things said about him.  And in the last chapter, he attempts to explain away the securities violations he has been charged with and agreed to pay.<br />This book starts ok but quickly gets very boring and has nothing of value for a person trying to learn about short-selling.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you have a specific interest in bogus stock promotions.	2002-06-02

I'm a mortgage trader in a regional investment banking firm so I looked forward to this book about the business even though it deals with the stock side.  But many things bother me about the book.  The story is of an intelligent guy clearly not qualified for a Wall Street job who gets a job at Cramer's hedge fund referred through one of the large investors.  Ok, that could happen.  The book does a good job of relating the mundane tasks that beginning traders perform and in that respect, I think the book would be very good for beginning I-bankers.  The tasks can be very mundane but no matter how smart you are, the only way you learn is through repetition of doing the tasks daily.  The author seems to have a knack for the business and eventually develops to recommending his own stocks.<br />But the author just can't put up with the belligerent, tyranical Jim Cramer who runs the firm.  Well, welcome to investment banking where egos are dominant.  Yes, Cramer is the worst variety.  And there are stories of illegal or at least unethical trading.  But the author just doesn't appear to have the stomach for the business and can't sleep at night and can't put up with the abuse from Cramer so he eventually quits a job that started at less than $25,000 even though it quickly grew to a six figure income.<br />I don't follow Cramer on CNBC but clearly this book is written to play on his fame.  Yes, it is a hatchet job and maybe deserved.  But it is very thinly written and focuses on some very petty examples.  But did I enjoy it?  Yes.  I happen to like books about investment banking and this book had those.  But I would caution that if you are looking for earth shattering information about a stock icon, it's really not here.	2002-04-29

I agree with a previous reviewer who said all of this has been written before.  However, no where has someone provided a good historical of the total Dot.com bubble and this book does it perfectly.<br />Providing great insights into the stock market as well as management of the Treasury market by Greenspan, the author does a great job of providing an economic overview of the climate that helped create bubble, allowed it to flourish and eventually led to its demise.<br />This overall perspective now allows an interested reader to see how a bubble could happen.  Everyone knew the stocks were overpriced but as long as they continued to go up, money managers could not refuse to hold the stocks as their yield comparsions would look so much worse than their competitors.<br />In summary, there is no new ground broken here.  Just a valid analysis of a fascinating period in our history.	2002-04-24

Not from an entertainment perspective	I read this book after hearing it referred to as great literature somehow intertwined with the worship of Frank Gifford, the former New York Giant.  But this book is really a journey in the dispair of one man's life.  Many have talked of this introspective look at living in American society with unrealistic expectations.  But this is more about a very troubled man who just happens to be able to brillantly weave sentences.  And that's the most amazing story that he could write after the abuse he had done to his body and brain.<br />I read books to be entertained or to learn.  This book is not entertaining.  In fact, for the first half of the book, it's very depressing.  He works for a while as a teacher after time spent at a mental institution and loves Frank Gifford and the Giants.  His teaching job is always in jeopardy due to his well known drinking problems.  And this guy is not your average drunk.  This is a serious drinking problem that negatively effects every friend and family member through his life.<br />After a second round at the mental institution, the author makes his way to Chicago and leads a fairly normal life with a quality job, friends, bars to drink in and girls to date.  At this point in the book I was so relieved to see the guy have some happiness, the book became enjoyable.  Particularly as he describes his deepest relationship and the irony of its ending.  Upon a return to New York state, he marries a normal wealthy girl and describes in detail the weekends spent with her sister's family and the unique relationship he builds with his eccentric brother-in-law.  These relationships all start to end badly as his wife becomes pregnant and his drinking eventually sends him back to the mental institution.  Only at the end does he realize that his children who he initially didn't care for are the most important part of his life.  Of course, by then every meaningful relationship is destroyed.<br />While I didn't care for the story, it is easy to become mesmerized by some of his descriptions and sentence structure. Would I recommend this book to someone?  Not if they want to be entertained. But there is something to learn here. But the time spent to learn the lesson may not be warranted.  Great literature?

An Austrialian officer works on oceanliners in WWII crossing the Atlantic carrying soldiers.  Yes, it is dangerous work as some ships were sunk.  Fortunately, none of his crosses involved direct action other than high alerts and brief sightings. Unfortunately, that severely limits the action in the book.  Other than these crossings, the book substantially covers the shore leave in New York City and England.  This was a great time to be in these exciting locations but reads more like a travelogue than an interesting nonfiction war book.<br />In summary, this author has good intention and describes his history in WWII.  It just isn't the most exciting book unless you have interest in that period of history.	2002-03-18

In this book, Roskelly writes short stories from throughout his climbing career and provides a good framework of how he became a climber and how he stayed alive.  Probably the most interesting theme through this book was the value he placed on having good climbing partners and how close he was to the partners.  That's interesting because it was very clear from reading Nanda Devi that he was very opinionated and compromise is not his specialty.  Not only does he stow high praise on these climbing partners, but there is also a story of a renowned hunter who befriends Roskelly and eventually struggles with cancer.  This was a particularly heartwarming story of a great individual and his unique ability to hunt.<br />But the stories that will leave you wanting more involve high-altitude climbing where death is close at hand.  One particular story has Roskelly awakening in the middle of the night realizing he is suffering from pulmonary edema and will die if he doesn't drop altitude.<br />This book provides great mountaineering stories as well as insight into the life of John Roskelly, the renowned climber.  I highly recommend this book for anyone with interest in mountain climbing.	2002-03-18

One of the few celebrities that didn't care to have the spotlight on her to lead a quality life.  And that's what comes through this book.  But unfortunately, virtually all of this was already known so there is no new ground  to cover.<br />Yes, Bo is beautiful and a part of American film legend.  And the pictures in the book again demonstrate just how photogenic she is.  But she politely attempts to dispel the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; myth without giving us much depth.  She was raised in a slightly unconventional family which spent quite a bit of time with Ann Margaret and her family.  She was discovered young without much formal education but traveled widely with her Svengali husband.  Living with John Derek is an education in itself.  She slightly attempts to debunk the theory that he led her life.  While that may be true in form, in substance, his influence was so great it altered her behavior patterns similar to his.<br />Bo's career was really a &quot;flash in the pan&quot;, 10, Tarzan and Bolero followed by long periods out of the industry.  Bo seemed content to lead a quiet home life in love with her husband and her animals.  Frankly, I was surprised the book was not a proclamation of her devotion to John.  Rather, it was a testament to her love of her animals with John more of a sidelight.<br />Bo has survived and enjoyed her life while the same time mentally and emotionally growing.  This is a very &quot;soft&quot;, fast read to understand more about her. It is not a deep read but does give a glimpse of the life of a celebrity.  There are no life's lessons to learn here.  But if you followed her career, you will probably enjoy this book.	2002-03-18

It's well written by an intelligent man who saw the industry from a perspective few do, as studio head.  The man that writes the checks.  Medavoy is pretty blunt about how movies get made and how he managed to make bad movies as well as good.<br />The highlight of the book comes early as he is in charge of production at UA and produces Best Oscar movies repeatedly in his first few years starting with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Rocky.  UA specialized in making artist's driven movies which shaped Medavoy's footprint to stay away from youthful, tentpole event movies throughout his career.  From Rocky to The Terminator to Silence of the Lambs you will be amazed at the stars and movies that Medavoy worked with.  To further this study of movie history, after UA Medavoy worked at Tri-star pictures shortly after it was purchased by Sony working with Peter Guber and Jon Peters.  This first-hand account of the Japanese invasion in Hollywood is interesting in and of itself.<br />Medavoy does a great job of focusing this book on the movies, the personalities involved, and the business side of the industry.  He does not burden the reader with unwanted history of his childhood.  But he does give great insight into the cultural influences of his job, the intellectual environment he functioned in, and his political involvement with Gary Hart and Bill Clinton.  I strongly recommend this book if you like movies, stories of the business side of making movies, or American cultural influences of the last 30 years.<br />While on vacation a year ago, I played tennis for a couple of days with Medavoy and his business associate Arnie Weems.  In my brief encounter with him, it's obvious he is an extremely intelligent man.  A somewhat reserved man, who showed no real interest in intellectual discussion but only in relaxing and enjoying his tennis.  His associate who was mentioned in the book was much more outgoing and friendly.  I believe Medavoy's reserved nature is due to the many people who want to know him to somehow break into the movie business so his reserved nature is understandable.nd friendly.

I read for entertainment.  This book provides a great combination as it is a biography of a family steeped in money management and also gives tips of how they were able to grow their fortune.<br />The book traces the investment history of Shelby Davis to his son to his grandsons.  Shelby had family money through his wife and starts investing shortly after the crash in '29.  Like many people, I assumed the market has been a somewhat continual climb with some setbacks.  This books traces the history showing the many periods of lackluster stock value growth and how most Americans shunned the stock market for bonds.  Quite a difference from today.<br />The original Shelby was a miserly value investor who never spent an extra dime.  His investment hits were insurance stocks when no one liked that industry and some prudent investments in Japan, also mainly in the insurance industry.  By leaving these investments to compound for years, Shelby built a great fortune.  But the hidden engine behind this vast growth was the use of margin to leverage his returns.  The original Shelby eventually grew his fortune to over a billion dollars in value.<br />Shelby's son Shelby did not work with his father until late in his life but eventually became a money manager of some renown also.  His philosophy was similar but different and his large money winners tended to be from other industries.  The book ends with the sons of Shelby Jr. taking over their father's money management firm and establishing their own identity.<br />Along this 70 year history, you will learn about the markets and the different stages of development over the years.  A significant amount of time is spent in the 60s and 70s as both of the Shelby's were investing at that time.  I strongly recommend this book if you have interest in the market and its history.	2002-02-27

A fascinating Tale!!	This book was written in the 1980s about a college student who grows from a small-time pot peddler to a major cocaine dealer.  I have one major complaint with this book.  Mark Bowden writes in a very detailed style which makes the book slow to read at first.  I had the same problem reading Black Hawk Down by Bowden but eventually came to realize that was one of the best stories I've ever read.  This one is a very good story also and I eventually couldn't put it down as it read quickly in the last half.<br />Bowden does very detailed research and this book is no exception.  Bowden chronicles all of the characters that help Larry in building his empire.  And, more importantly, he tries very hard to get inside Larry's mind to show what made him tick.  And that's what makes the story so interesting as Larry had many fine qualities.  He clearly would have been sucessful in any field but watching him walk through the minefield of a dealer is really interesting.  Through this journey he is ripped off at gunpoint with his wife, ripped off by his workers and ripped off by a financial advisor who sees Larry as the answer to his problems.  Other highlights include the lives of his workers, some of who are very eccentric and develop very bad coke habits to the point of humor.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you like fully researched real-life dramas about life on the edge.  While this book was written about 15 years ago, Bowden does a great update in 2001 to revisit Larry and see how his life is turning out in prison.	2002-01-28

Right-wingers are so sensitive and appear to dislike anything not supportive of their cause that I have real doubt as to the credibility of their claims.  Well, here is a telling expose from one of their purported enemies.<br />Goldberg has worked at CBS for quite some time and had a close working relationship with Dan Rather.  That ended in 1996 when he wrote a Wall Street Journal article concerning media bias and became persona non grata to Dan Rather.  And that is one of the biggest weaknesses of the book for as much as he says he has no problem with Rather, he continues to try and get in the last word and build the case that Rather has a liberal bias and is a nasty guy to his enemies.  Goldberg did manage to work another 5 years at CBS in a reduced role.<br />Now clearly Goldberg is bitter.  But his premise is that the wealthy New York media doesn't believe they have a bias as their world is so different from \\"flyover\\" Americans.  While they see Right to Choice as only justified, they don't understand the religious conviction that condemns this practice.  While they view Affirmative Action as an appropriate action to fairness, they've never been in a living environment with low and middle income Americans where this issue is more controversial.<br />Once you wade through the Rather digs, Goldberg does offer about 6 distinctive treatments of liberal bias that have basis.  For example, in the impeachment proceedings, Republicans walk in and are identified as Conservative Republicans while no Democrats are called Liberal Democrats.  The AIDs scare is examined how the media scares the public into believing the risk to heterosexuals is much greater than it really is.  Also affirmative action is examined in depth.<br />Does he have a basis?  After reading this as unbiased as possible, I believe he does.  He clearly states there is not a conspiracy.  Just a viewpoint not consistent with the massive constituents in America as to what is liberal and what is not.  I do recommend this book to anyone wanting to examine this issue as it is powerfully written from someone who was able to see both sides of the argument.e, I believe he does.

This book will make you angry and sad and will make you cry without a doubt. It is an emotional roller coaster that I couldn't recommend higher. I would strongly encourage you to start by reading the closing epilogue. Bowden explains his amazement that the story had not been appropriately documented and how he was able to meet many combatants at a memorial dedication that opened the doors for him to write this incredible book. I would also strongly encourage you to read the book prior to the movie. While I enjoyed the movie, the written words of the book more accurately record how deadly this attack was and the terror involved. This is not meant as a negative review on the movie, just the power of this book.<br />I must admit, I only vaguely remembered this event. And that is a sad statement that these men could die in the duty of their country without the nation remembering them. The Somalia mission was to provide food for the starving. But in a country dominated by civil war, the top warlord, Adid, quickly steals the food giving the UN Peace force a reason to expand the mission to controlling Adid.<br />On this day, the Rangers and Delta force storm a meeting to capture two top ranking Adid officials when eventually two Black Hawks are shut down. Immediately surrounded by a frenzied crowd, the Rangers and Delta force must fight to save fellow soldiers overcoming fear and injuries to stay alive. It's absolutely amazing more were not killed, as they had to spend the night in this hostile environment.<br />Areas the book covered well not particularly well covered in the movie include some of the following. The difference in Rangers and Delta Force. I was not aware of the power of the Delta Force and how they trained differently. This may have contributed to the problems of the mission. Lack of water and night vision on the mission. Since they thought this was a one-hour mission beginning at 3:00 in the afternoon, no one thought to bring water. What a terrible mistake in this hot environment under extreme physical duress. In addition, the terror of the \\"Lost Convoy\\" could not accurately be reflected in the movie. The book describes how the convoy would stop at each crossroad giving the terrorists time to run one block over and be waiting at every crossroad with a hail of bullets. Basically, every street was a reign of bullets and RPG. No wonder they eventually had to head to the base with over 50% casualties. Also, the plight of Mike Durant, the captured pilot was not covered thoroughly enough in the movie in my opinion.<br />As amazing as this story is, the fact the fighting crew had to run out with the armor support eventually moving ahead of them is even more astounding. I strongly recommend this book to learn more about the brave men who fight for their country.ission.

I had heard of this case but didn't know prior to his investments in small insurance companies he had already been charged with improper handling of money and denied the ability to manage money by securities regulators.<br />Frankel was a shy, slight built man with minimal self-confidence.  While very young, he developed an interest in the stock market and performed substantial research.  Living in a small Ohio town, this took on somewhat of a mystique and people assumed he knew more than they did and would entrust him with money.  Amazingly, once he had this money, he complained of \\"traders block\\" and executed very few trades.  Oh well, there was still something else he could do with the money.  Spend it.  Amazingly, this guy parlays this Ponzi scheme into an insurance empire all the time spending the investments of the companies.  It's absolutely amazing he was able to do this.<br />Even more bizarre, the goober then develops an interest in S&M sex.  Well, since he has no social skills, he puts ads in alternative newspapers.  When he meets the girls and none resemble Playmates, he quickly moves through them but keeps them on payroll.  Imagine a Mormon and his wives but he isn't married and all them women want to marry him for money.  What a crazy cast of characters!!!!<br />This book will make you want to be a thief once you see how easy it was for this idiot.

This is a detailed account cowritten by two of the climbers and is very detailed including the long walk in.  I was surprised how little mountain climbing had changed although it did appear distances traveled daily were less as they required 8 campsites to get to the peak.  I find books on mountaineering expeditions very interesting although the climbs themselves contain long periods of boredom.  This expedition is no different as a brutal storm stops the climbers just short of the summit.  The book does a great job detailing how high altitude can effect a climber's body.  One of the writers was a doctor.<br />Needless to say, the long, unforgiving storm takes it's toll on the men placing them in ultimate peril.  Getting down from the high altitude, steep face carrying a wounded member led to the most incredible living disaster I have ever read.

What makes this book exceptional is not the detail of the tragedy but rather the lack of teamwork in this expedition and the author's role in the conflict.  The closing remarks also frame the danger in being a high altitude climber as eventually 4 of the 13 members of this team die on the mountains in later years.<br />This expedition had two leaders, uncommon for high altitude expeditions.  Initial meetings detail disagreements in selection of climbers and goals for the climb.  With no clear leader, these initial disagreements festered on the mountain and contributed to the partial failure of the expedition.  But the unique perspective of this book is that the author appears to be the central antagonist in the disagreements.  Now clearly, he writes from his perspective and supports his position in a no compromise, &quot;perfection&quot; oriented climbing method.  But it's clear these conflicts are partially his fault as he has minimal compromising capabilities which exasperates the team leaders.  I've never read a climbing adventure so centered on a conflict that ends in such tragic proportions.<br />The characters on this climb are expertly described by the author and the expedition is described in detail.  I hesitate to provide details of the climb so you might enjoy the excitement in the read but suffice to say, the most compelling human being on the mountain ends up in the most precarious fate.  Read this book if you enjoy climbing or tales of adventure.  You will not be disappointed.	2002-01-05

But be forewarned, it reads like a history book and takes a real time commitment to finish.  The author goes back to the beginning career of Jules Stein and booking of bands through the sale of Universal to the Bronfman's.  Clearly the focus of the book is Lew Wasserman who led MCA from agency to studio with significant influences in politics.<br />Probably the most entertaining part of the book is the unique stories of the stars of the 40s and 50s since Wasserman was at his peak making careers.  Stories are presented about Tony Curtis, Jimmy Stewart and Marilyn Monroe to name a few and are quite entertaining as well as showing Wasserman's power to destroy or make a career.<br />This book tries to intertwine politics, entertainment and the mafia, and while there may be a connection, sometimes he seems to reach too far and lose focus on the principals who grew MCA into the behemoth that it was.  I recommend this book to anyone with an in-depth interest in Hollywood history and what it was like from mid-century.	2001-12-30

Since his favorite team is the New Orleans Saints, the story starts in a small humidity oppressed Louisiana town that is the sight of training camp.  Woody does a great job getting to know the players and attempting to know management and how decisions are made.  It's clear very early that the NFL and the Saints don't know what to make of this book and seem to have some concern that it will be a hatchet job.<br />But Woody writes like a true Saints fan who wants to know the players and what it's like to try to make a team.  The deck is really stacked against these guys as they must beat out returning players and drafted rookies.  Woody gives great examples of the many undrafted free agents who went on to become quality NFL players.  But this year's group doesn't appear to have an immediate star and some of the players start dropping immediately.  Some of the rookies have great practices followed by weak practices.  Some have minor injuries that limit their already limited playing time.  And some are trying to fill positions where there are no real spots.<br />It makes for an interesting read from the early cuts to the few that make it right to the final cut.  Woody does a good job of showing the fears, insecurities and sacrifices these players make trying to fulfill their dream.  Read this book if you are a fan of football.	2001-12-17

I was disappointed.  First, this is a very old book written in the 70's.  Almost an amatuerish attempt.  This book describes the drug smuggler, how he gets in the business, how he imports and makes his connections, and how he eventually is caught.  Unfortunately, the author didn't know how to edit the book and instead starts on a story and then decides to give you an education on everything he has read about the subject.  Then he goes back to the story.  Therefore, I found this book to be verrrrry slow.<br />On the positive side, it's almost comical how this guy falls in the business and decides to go to Columbia to set up his product.  Not really knowing anyone, he just meets street people and eventually runs into connections.  The smuggler's real talent is concocting the scam on bringing the product in.  Most of his shipments are not stopped, but even if they were, he develops stories so his mules can act like they had no knowledge and won't be charged.  You should be aware, this is really not a big-time smuggler on the scale of the Blow character, but rather this smuggler brings in enough to last him a few months, then goes back for another trip.<br />If you're interested in drug smuggling, this book may fill in the holes.  But from a pleasurable fascinating pleasurable read, there are better books like &quot;Blow&quot;.	2001-12-17

This gets more complicated when his 15 year old daughter decides she'd like to give it a try.  Now in addition to his own insecurities, he must confront his relationship with his daughter as she moves to the age where she starts to separate from her parents but also must address the many insecurities that come with growing up.  If you are buying this book for a climbing adventure only, this is the wrong book.  But if you want detailed climbing info from beginner to the ascent of a continental summit, maybe this will satisfy you.<br />This book really shines describing his family relationships and watching his young daughter grow into an independent woman.  Read this book if you climb or like climbing stories.  But more importantly read this book to explore interpersonal relationships with your kids.	2001-12-17

Unfortunately this book is written in the typical how to play tennis and be better at it.  There are pictures showing the different strokes and grips.  It's actually not similar to Brad's book at all although it does have a couple examples of how Brad and other players used mental advantages to win matches against better players.<br />If you are a beginner and want to read a good &quot;how to&quot; book, this would be fine.  But if you already play and are looking for some useful tips from a master, this doesn't quite fill the bill.	2001-12-02

But a very low level of Wall Street and it's only through luck and good fortune he was able to become a successful Hedge Fund manager.  And very successful he was.<br />The unique fact about Steinhardt is he never seemed to be quite comfortable with his profession or his religeon.  Early in his hedge fund career he took a year off only to come back for many more years.  Later, he shut down his hedge fund in what you could argue was the height of his career.<br />His views on religeon are even more unique.  Very Jewish, he considers himself an atheist while supporting Israel and charities to promote the Jewish culture in younger Americans.  I applaud his philanthropic commitment.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you have interest in investing and want to read about one of the success stories and how it happened.	2001-12-02

A nice guy and a nice read but if you are buying this to read controversial info on celebrities, you will disappointed.<br />Alf describes his early life, history in the service and boxing followed by his foray into the life of a bodyguard.  Alf has great history with the Beatles particularly, but also the Stones, Led Zeppelin, Cher and Frank Sinatra as well as many others.  While he talks about the good traits, there is no dirt or secrets about these people.<br />Probably the most interesting relationship he has is with Mike Nesmith of the Monkees.  Mike comes across as an interesting guy stuck in a bubble gum band that wants to evolve on a higher level musically.<br />While this is an enjoyable read, there is no real meat to the book that would need to be there to sell in large numbers.	2001-12-02

It is unique in that it was written by the head of media relations after the collapse of the company and he was able to get information from both the competing factions.<br />The company founder is an excellent entreprenuer who has started another company, made good money, but then blew up the company as he was too marketing motivated without taking care of the details.  With a great internet idea, he was able to generate investments from many of the corporate titans like Paul Allen and Fred Smith.  This helped grow the hype allowing the founder to have a paper net worth of over $1 billion at one time.<br />Unfortunately, it was a house of cards and quickly came tumbling down as the financial statistics demanded from Wall Street started to shift from growth to income.  The founder was unable to shift out of his &quot;idea&quot; mentality and couldn't hand the company to the chosen experienced CEO.  But that would be understating the meglomaniac tendancy of this guy and that's what makes the read so exciting.<br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in the Internet world or business case studies and what can go wrong.  I read some of the reviews by some of the former employees of the company who did not like what the author had to say.  I found his point of view to be excellent and as unbiased as possible as he admitted allegiance to both sides in the corporate struggle and how he dealt with it. READ THIS BOOK.	2001-12-02

Yes, I've read the other reviews concerned with minor inaccuracies and lack of mention of significant climbers.  But, hey, I'm a novice and have never been to Yosemite although I hope to go in the next year.  Duane is best in interviewing the legends and telling their background stories and trying to translate the reasons they climb.  It's a fascinating story. My favorite being the men stuck on the wall when a storm comes and their bivouc tents are virtually destroyed.  Also, it's nice to read about the free spirits whose goal in life have nothing to do with money and all to do with the Wall.  Overall, I found this book informative, very concise, and filled with great pictures.  It may not however, satisfy the experienced climbers who follow climbing history or have significant experience in Yosemite.  But for people fascinated with climbing and the personalities involved, it was a great quick, informative read.	2001-10-21

This is a great story of a well-run college football team in a depressed part of the country still struggling to overcome the Depression and Dust Bowl, and how much this team meant to the people of this state.  This story also gives you insight into a totally different era where players were tougher from growing up in a frugal environment and played without facemasks.  But it does have a lot in common with today's athlete, as there is open talk of OU paying their players to the particular chagrin of Texas boosters.<br />After a brief background set-up of the coaches and how Bud Wilkinson became coach (a unique story in itself) the book quickly dives into the record winning streak after briefly touching on the first shorter streak. Bud Wilkinson clearly comes off as a tremendous college coach respected by all.  There are in-depth portrayals of the players including their strengths and weaknesses.  One of the stars, Tommy McDonald comes across as a prima donna while quarterback Jimmy Harris is the ultimate team player.  But maybe the most interesting story is of the first black player to play for OU and the problems from hotels, restaurants and even other teammates.<br />I strongly recommend this book for college football fans with interests in OU or wanting to broaden your horizons on what it was like to play in a previous era without faceguards and developed passing and kicking games.  This of course will be of interest to anyone with Oklahoma ties as it is such a significant part of the history of the state.	2001-10-18

This novel is more a character study of an isolated climber who becomes somewhat of a legend but continues to struggle with interpersonal relationships.<br />From a climbing perspective, I found the stories mildly unfulfilling but understand now that that is not the central theme of the novel.  But more importantly, I particular found the interpersonal relationships unfulfilling.  Starting in Los Angeles where this common worker lived with a woman and her son, initially as a renter and eventually as a lover.  Cut quickly to Europe to two significant and unfulfilled relationships although one has long-standing consequences.  Back to Santa Barbara for a reunion with a fellow hunter and his wife ending in unsatisfied conflict.<br />Ok, I'm sure I'll be hammered as not intelligent enough to &quot;get it&quot;.  But the book did not satisfy my fascination with thrilling rock climbs and it certainly didn't satisfy my desire to watch characters connect in a fulfilling manner.<br />OK read but not a classic.	2001-10-18

This book does a great job of describing life on the Women's circuit right as the Williams sisters are exerting their dominance.  But the Williams sisters aren't the only focus of this book. Rather, each &quot;star&quot; of the tour is given special treatment allowing the reader to make a determination about all the positives and negatives of the characters.<br />Martina Hingis is covered in depth as the rest of the tour players finally caught up with her and started to pass her.  Her relationship with her mother is covered as well as her cocky, confident attitude.  Lindsey Davenport gets great coverage as a friend to all, a great tennis player, but really just an average American kid with a superlative talent.  The book also did a good job of covering Capriati even though it was about the season prior to her breakthrough of two Grandslams.<br />But this book really is about the &quot;Superstars&quot; of the tour, the Williams sisters and Anna Kournikova.  Kournikova is portrayed just as she is seen; an attractive brat who is so self absorbed it's hard to see why anyone could like her if they had to speak to her.  And the Williams sisters are presented as superb athletic players without the social skills to build close relationships on the tour and handicapped by a joker of a father who concocts bold lies to make up for his shortcomings and the spotlight not always being on him.<br />Yes, just another typical day at the office if you happen to be a women's tennis pro.  Read this book if you like tennis or primma donnas.	2001-10-11

As in so many other business stories, it seems to boil down to egos and personalities.  In this case, the Chrysler chairman is not an aggressive outgoing leader like Bob Lutz, his second in command.  Eventually, this character flaw may have led to the takeover of Chrysler as he didn't feel they could go it alone.<br />But personalities are really the key on the Mercedes side where their outgoing chairman loved his job and all the perks that came with it. Including the opportunity to make his mark in German history.  Clearly, he out negotiated Chrysler.<br />But there is a third party to this story and that's how the book opens with an analysis of Kirk Kerkorian's takeover attempt with the famous ego maniac, Lee Ioccoa.<br />With all these egos in one story, it's just a matter of time till a blow-up with billions of dollars lost by shareholders.  Particularly, Kerkorian who has lawsuits pending.<br />Yes this is a long book which can get bogged down in detailed analysis of negotiations.  But the business case study is exceptional and worth the read if you enjoy cars or exceptional business stories.	2001-10-11

This book describes the 29th Division from their long stay in England to the difficult capture of St.Lo about a month after D-Day.  It's an excellent history with some of the best detail describing the trip from England to the beach.  Also, there is extreme detail of the American theory of attack vs. the German's which is quite interesting.  There is quite a difference, particularly in the use of firepower and movement of troops.<br />But where the book fails vs. a Stephon Ambrose type book is the lack of personal attachment to the individuals.  Where a Stephan Ambrose book clearly takes most of the information from detailed soldier interviews, this books seemed to take all it's information from military journals of the war.  It read so clinically I wondered if soldiers were interviewed to get the human side of the story.  Reading the bibliography, it claims there were interviews.<br />I am so intrigued by the sacrifice made by our WWII veterans.  I just don't feel this did justice to these men.  It might be better read by someone studying the war in college from a tactical standpoint.  I'd recommend Band of Brothers or Ghost Soldiers for stories of WWII that better let you feel the emotion of the fight.  Not a bad book. Just didn't totally attach the reader to the soldiers who sacrificed so much.	2001-09-09

It does have a few interesting quirks. Roberts was a Harvard student who climbed and this book describes two different ascents in Alaska on Deborah and Mt. Huntington. Not only are the two climbs entirely different, so is the writing style since they were written at different times. The first story is the Deborah ascent made with only one other climber. This story was written later and clearly narrates the climb while the Huntington climb tends to write in a more imaginative style attempting to explore thoughts and reasons why people climb. Frankly, I scanned some paragraphs in the second story as he would get on a tangent and leave the climbing facts. This climb is much more exciting due to the success of the climb and two more personalities involved on the climb. The Deborah climb tends to be one hardship after another. Having said this, there is a shocking occurrence after the successful climb that touches the climbers for the rest of their lives. This story has so emotionally attached you as a member of the party that it is impossible to put down for the last 50 pages. I recommend this book to mountaineering fans interested in the mundane tasks necessary for a successful Alaska assault. Also this will be interesting for readers wanting to explore interpersonal relationships under extreme hardships.	2001-08-27

Times Dynasty	Books	5	9	10	N	Y	Great examination of the growth of LA & its great paper	I really liked this book. As a fan of LA where I travel often for business and pleasure, this book fills in the history of how LA was built and the role played by the driving family of the LA Times. But as interesting as this history is, there are so many subplots to follow that are also fun. For example, as the family is accepted in the Pasadena \\"blue-blooded\\" culture, it's interesting how most become so snobbish about accepting anyone in their culture. My favorite stories on this subject are his second wife's training to develop social graces to travel in the Chandler's circles that was somewhat required. Also, when he divorces at 50, his Mom starts investigating which of her friends have unmarried daughters that would be acceptable marriage bait for this 50 year old bachelor. Like he can't take care of himself.<br />But enough of the small stuff, this book is about the Times and LA and starts with the Otis family and its purchase of the Times. The General and his Son-in-law ran this paper as a Republican tour guide of LA. And it worked. Maybe too good as LA is way too crowded. Along the way is great history of the need for water and the shady ways it was obtained as well as real estate development stories including a foray in Mexico.<br />Harry Chandler's son Norman ran it much the same way but his son Otis Chandler who took over around 1960 was much more liberal and open to debate and other opinions which did not endear him with his pompous family. This break seemed to eventually lead to his ouster in 1985 even though he had grown the earnings strength of the paper. I believe the book did not adequately explain the buildup to his ouster. His Chairman comes in and it's over. Clearly, Otis was partially to blame as his hobbies of hunting, cars and lifting weights took away his attention.<br />The replacements proceed to tear down the paper leading to its eventual sale to the Chicago Tribune. It's a very interesting business story although from that perspective it could have done a better job by financially describing the significance of the paper's net worth at different points in history.<br />But the book also overlaid the history of Otis' family, as he clearly was where most of the information for this book came from. Interestingly, Otis grew up in an exclusive family attending Andover and Stanford. But while two of his sons attended prep school and top colleges, one did not. And many of his offspring did not marry inside their social set and did not rise to the same levels as captains of industry. Otis Chandler did not place large pressure on his family to live the same social life he was forced to live and it's interesting how they grew up and the relationships they had with their parents. With so many transplanted Southern Californians all enjoying the beautiful weather, it was inevitable that many in his family would marry outside the Pasadena blue-blooded set.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely but it is a time commitment at over 450 pages of small print. I recommend this book for someone interested in journalism, the history of LA and Southern California, or a history of a wealthy influential family that helped shape the future of LA.could have done a better job by financially describing the significance of the paper's net worth at different points in history.<br />But the book also overlaid the history of Otis' family, as he clearly was where most of the information for this book came from.

The author does a great job of character development and he invents a wide variety of characters to paint.  Of course all these characters could happen in the adult fantasy land of LA.  You have the kept woman, the prim and proper WASP wife, the actor who will do homosexual favors, as well as an assortment of scum Hollywood players. With a wide blend of characters, Dunne proceeds to create chaos at every turn while challenging each character's view of the different classes of people generated.<br />Read this if you like stories of wealthy people, Hollywood, or murder mysteries.

This is the first Ambrose book I have read and it will not be my last.  This book is about to be made into an HBO special mini-series and promises to be a big hit if it can relay the emotion felt while reading this book.<br />This book focuses on one company from training through the end of the war.  It continually emphasizes that the training in the states is what made the elite paratrooper group so special.  The book does not scrimp on more mundane parts of the war like training, waiting in England for the D-Day raid, and after surrender duties.<br />But clearly the most mesmerizing parts are the vicious fighting role the group played in knocking out enemy positions on D-Day.  The company then goes on extended duty fighting in some of the most important battles of the war.  Sometimes these battles are intense, and sometimes they are just boring and terror-filled as you dodge artillery in the cold of a foxhole for days.<br />An interesting part of the book to me was the role the group played in Germany after the surrender.  There was much looting and unfortunately, much drinking and debauchery which led to some deaths.  Ambrose correctly relayed the point system to get sent back to the states and the severe disappointment of some soldiers, as they had to continue to serve instead of immediately coming home.<br />After a completely enjoyable read, it was interesting to read how the company has stayed in touch, and the success and failures of the company in civilian life.  I strongly encourage reading this book if you have interest in war books, books converted to movies, or books about true American heroes that made this country great.	2001-08-08

Obsessed with surfing, Da Bull convinced his parents to let him attend school in Hawaii with older surfers.  The Da Bull describes finding the incredible surfing spots, which are so well known to the world today.<br />The highlights of this book are introductions to the legends that started big wave surfing and their wild and crazy lifestyle.  Da Bull may have been the wildest and does a great job of relaying the stories without appearing cocky or self-serving.  Da Bull gravitated to surfboard construction through many of the evolutions of surfboards before he finally tired of the scene and became a commercial fisherman.  It's always interesting to see how these young men mature and I found Da Bull's journey very interesting.  Never interested in surfing competition, Da Bull has virtually no contact with the surfing community other than old friends.<br />Read this book if you want to know the history of surfing and the talented but eccentric men who blazed the trail.	2001-08-08

By comparison, this book is more surface stories.  Some of the same tales were told but here it was like the stories were being retold by someone who had heard them with someone else and relays them with no research.  Also, this book goes through some stories that are really not about surfing.<br />This book was adequate, but it didn't project the passion of other books I have read about surfing.  It's like going to the bar, listening to your buddies tell surf stories without knowing if they're true.  But maybe that's good enough.	2001-07-14

No wonder one national periodical named their hero of the 20th Century the Common American Soldier.<br />This book intertwines the history of the fight for the Phillipines with the rescue of the remaining soldiers.  After a bloody battle against odds, the Americans run out of supplies and are forced to surrender only to be marched for miles, &quot;The Bataan Death March&quot; to the prison, and for most death.  As Allied forces prepare to retake the island, plans are made to rescue the remaining prisoners on a very risky mission.<br />This book tells this story in great detail and switches back from the Death March to the March to Free the Prisoners.  But the story does not end with the recapture as the soldiers must now march a great distance back to Allied forces.<br />There is great detail and much sadness and suffering.  But it ends with the great will of the soldiers to endure their burden and the rescuers overjoyed with the success of their mission.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you like books of adventure or patriotism.	2001-07-14

They're not rocket science but they get you into the story quicker than any other writer I know.  Ok, maybe he doesn't finish as strong and it does start to get predictable a little over half way through, but I still find his books very entertaining.  I like to describe his books as the perfect read at the beach, you can't put it down and it will pass your hours quickly.<br />This book has Stone Barrington back to solve mysteries as the former policeman, lawyer, private eye, ladies man.  Stuart really wanted to get Stone in hot water so he brought back most of his former loves for at least cameo appearances.  Stuart seems to enjoy setting his books in different environments and this time it's Palm Beach with a look out how wealthy people live.  Really, wealthy people and the people who want to be around them.  Some people say the ending is predictable and maybe it is but there are always enough surprises to keep me entertained.  I look forward to his next book whatever it may be.	2001-07-13

This is a collection of short stories but it does a great job of covering the total history of Big Wave surfing, particularly paying attention to the heroes of the 50s and 60s the water skills necessary to challenge large waves.  With complete coverage and analysis of all big wave sites and legends, I can't imagine what it left unturned.<br />This exciting sport has elevated itself recently with &quot;ski in&quot; surfing and these stories do a great job of covering the controversy of this sport's growth and it's trailblazer, Laird Hamilton.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you like surfing or are enthralled by the culture of these people who devote their lives to the ocean.	2001-07-13

I once again was not disappointed.  This book goes into more detail of the training and the schedule the pilots kept prior to the raid.  It also goes into depth about the trip to Japan and the great job the Navy did in their support role.<br />But the highlight of the book is the raid and exactly what they saw during the raid.  This is followed by a harrowing crash and month in China staying one step ahead of the Japanese.  This part of the story shows the value of the Chinese people who helped even though it put their life in danger.  Did I mention hardship?  Imagine having your leg amputated in a field hospital with little medical equipment.<br />These men are truly valiant heroes and it's great to read their stories of valor.	2001-07-13

I enjoyed this book and was amazed by the depths to which these men sank.  The writer did a great job pulling his information from all sources available for a story 180 years old.  When there was disagreements as to stories, this was pointed out.  By now you have probably heard the main part of the story:  massive whale attacks and sinks ship, men are put in small whaling ships and set out on the sea to travel over 2,000 miles with crude navigational devices spending over 90 days on the sea. This book really describes in detail the depths the human body will go to from a physical and mental standpoint.  The book becomes so engrossing you can't put it down.  I do most of my reading at night but started reading early over breakfast right as the issue of cannibalism came up.  Not my best move as it is studied in depth.<br />This writer does a good job of relaying the journals kept and then translating the physical and mental effects to later studies done on starvation, particularly the Minnesota study done in the 1940s.<br />The crew eventually splits into four groups and it's interesting to see what happens to the four groups. I particularly found it interesting they were able to determine what happened to the three crew members left on an island after refusing to get back in the whaling boat.<br />Overall, I think you will enjoy this book.  If you like this book, I strongly encourage you to read Endurance about the journey of Shackleton.  It's very similar and mesmerizing how they survived in extreme cold.  I normally don't like period piece books but this is very good and I strongly recommend.  If you like books of adventure and survival, this is a good book for you.	2001-06-18

Wow!!! What an incredible story!  I have to admit I knew little about this raid but upon seeing &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; felt I needed to investigate further.  This book concisely covers every facet of the mission and quickly gets into the flight.<br />While it states what happened to all the crews, it clearly focuses on the 8 captured crewmen and what happened to them while in captivity.  I've read one other account of POWs written by John McCain and I can't help but applaud the training and quality of these men in their ability to survive.  If you've ever wondered exactly what water torture is, this book will explain it to you.<br />The second to last chapter covers the return of the last held in captivity, George Barr. Due to extremely poor health, he had to stay behind for some time prior to traveling.  What this did to him mentally will leave you in tears and I encourage you to buy this book if only for this chapter.<br />This is a great book of heroism and should be read by any American.  I strongly recommend this book.	2001-06-11

This is a complete history of Vegas from the slant of the author.  While there is plenty of information, that's part of the problem.  Sometimes there is just too much information.  With research this voluminous, the authors had to make some decisions about what areas to cover.  Generally, they focused on bankers, journalists, politicians and gangsters.  An inordinate amount of time was spent tying the gangsters to the CIA and plots to kill Castro.  But is that really part of Las Vegas history or national politics?  You should also be forewarned that the number of pages allocated over the past 20 years appeared to be much lower than coverage from '45 to '70.<br />Overall, I became somewhat bored although I did learn quite a bit.  The FBI agent Yablonsky trying to work in an environment where many times he was considered an enemy was particularly interesting.  Also, the journalist who wrote about Steve Wynn but not is effectively muzzled by Wynn's legal action shows where the true power is in Vegas.<br />Sometimes too much information detracts and for me that was the case here. I enjoyed the book &quot;Casino&quot; more which focused just on the gangsters move to Vegas as well as their eventual demise.	2001-06-10

It's impossible to not see the humor in his over-the-top story of various Hollywood players.  From the almost Producer, to the Uber (in love with himself) agent to the hopeful actress who will do anything to be a star, this movie has it all.  It's written in diary form by all the characters and relates the same events from various participants.  At first it's difficult to follow but eventually the storytelling is very funny as you learn more of the characters.<br />Of course the most sympathetic character is the poor mistreated writer since a writer wrote the book.  But this character is so pathetic; he almost deserves everything coming to him.<br />One more tale of a supposed good story that Hollywood jerks around till it looks totally different.  At least that we know to be true in real Hollywood.  I actually would rate this 3 1/2 stars if I could.	2001-06-05

When reading historical books or biographies, you're normally subjected to a slow start to provide background info.  Even this book's first chapters are interesting and then it quickly gets into the story.  What a fine balance it is for the author to cover facets of the story and correctly allocate the appropriate page space to the important parts of the story.<br />It is very clear the author did good research to determine possible breakdowns in the system forcing 900 men to spend 5 terrifying days floating in the ocean as fish food.  But the actual accounts of the sinking and subsequent time spent in the water are simply mesmerizing allowing you to feel the terror of this incident.  Probably the most exciting part of the story is the daring rescue when these men were on their last leg and most could not have survived another day.  How terrifying was their situation?  Well, when sailors take off their life jacket and prefer death to their existence, that should tell you their situation was grave indeed.<br />This book reads fast and furious.  I read it in one night since I was incapable of putting the book down.  This book will appeal to people exploring history or just pure adventure stories.  It reads like a screenplay and you can visualize this movie in a few years.	2001-05-20

It didn't hurt that the author was an attractive bodybuilder who just happens to be married to a writer or artist in LA.  Coupled with the exceptional Amazon customer reviews I eagerly looked forward to this book.<br />Maybe my expectations were too high.  I read the book quickly but as I awaited some extreme action event or revelation to heighten my excitement, I noticed I was already 3/4 of the way through the book.  Ok, I mildly enjoyed getting an inside look at precisely what a bodybuilder goes through in the steroid cycles leading up to competition.  And the sexual escapades and disclosures didn't bother me although they eventually become somewhat boring.  Unfortunately, I never felt the tremendous emotional attachment to the characters one generally looks for to really enjoy a novel.<br />This is a story of a bodybuilding obsessed woman who hooks up with a rich trainer who in return wants to &quot;hook up&quot;.  Repeatedly, and kinky.  It's also a story of her relationship with her young daughter and that daughter's resentment to her bodybuilding.  And there is also the former trainer who appears out of thin air and then disappears quickly and serves virtually no purpose in developing a cohesive story line for the book.<br />I'm glad the other reviewers enjoyed this book and am still struggling to understand why I didn't like it more. It just missed the button which I can only attribute to poor storytelling or poor character development.  Of course there is one other possibility.  Maybe I'm just a poor reader.	2001-05-17

But that's easy when you have touched so many people positively.  I hated the Bruins until they beat my beloved UofMemphis Tigers in 73 behind Walton's 21-22 shooting, still considered on of the greatest performances in basketball.  After that I listened to Wooden as a television analyst and it was inspiring.  No words were wasted. Not maximum entertainment.  Just pure knowledge for those willing to listen and learn.<br />That's what Wooden was and wanted to be, a teacher.  In this one book, he states his simple principles, where he learned them, and why they are important.  Imagine a man growing up early in this century in Indiana in a hardworking Midwestern family.  That's what Wooden was and that's what this book relays to the reader.<br />Don't read this book to get a basketball lesson.  Read this book to learn life's lesson and relish in a man who has no ego because he knows that it is a detriment.<br />I cannot say enough good things about this man and the life he led. This book was given to me by a friend of John Wooden's, autographed and enclosed with his personal business card. The business card contains the Pyramid for success.  John Wooden, always coaching, always teaching.	2001-05-12

The movie was average but the subject matter was something I wanted to explore after seeing George Jung's picture at the end.  I was not disappointed.  I couldn't put the book down and throughly enjoyed it.<br />As all biographies do, the initial setup of his formative years is somewhat boring and can be skimmed.  Bad student, played football.  Nothing else is relevant.  But when the book overlays living in Los Angeles in the 60's with the drug trade, this book really heats up.  Jung reminds me of Forrest Gump.  Always in a place where drug history was happening.  Particularly where his old grass connection is the key to establishing him as a major player in the new cocaine business.<br />The book and the movie have many similar points but many different ones.  For example, in the movie, his first stewardess girlfriend dies.  But in the book, there is no mention of when and how they split up.  In the movie, he misses his daughter and wants contact.  There is no mention of that in the book.<br />The book really projects that Jung ...got in the right business at the right time.  But he's not really a smart guy.  The movie covers some of his busts correctly but the Cape Cod bust that starts his downfall is almost unbelievable how stupid he could be.  Read the book to find this bizarre fact.<br />As a earlier reviewer who identified himself as a former drug runner stated, using your own product clouds your judgement and clearly that applied to Jung.  Irrespective, this book gives great insight into the drug traffic business and shows what a bizarre environment it was.  Somewhat like the Wild West.  Read this book for entertainment value as it reads quickly and is very informative.	2001-05-08

An incredible, lucky journey by a small boat returning to civilization, &amp; 4. crossing the final few miles to civilization on land.  I don't think I've given away the book because reading how they got into this jam and then get out of it is totally unbelievable.<br />I recommend this book to readers interested in adventures, war stories and nature.  Truly this book shows the real power of natural forces.	2001-05-02

This girl has serious problems.  Maybe they are family caused as the book tries to allude or maybe it's the easy money which suddenly starts to dry up. Irrespective, this girl is so self-destructive that at some point it gets pathetic.  But at least the book is consistent as virtually every other single girl in the book has self-destructive qualities.  I'm somewhat surprised that a Women's Lib group didn't have problems with this book on that pretext.<br />Irrespective, I did enjoy the book visualizing the single life in New York in the 80s.  Read this book if you want to know what the party scene in New York is like for a spoiled self-absorbed princess.  If not, take a pass.	2001-04-20

Athletics don't make money at any collegiate level (if costs included fixed plant expenses).  They can cause serious scandal for Universities.  But still the public demands winning programs.  Dr. Duderstadt was perfectly experienced to speak on this issue coming from a great school but also a former athlete.  He also brings an interesting perspective of the role of the Provost, which he held prior to being President.<br />But even after listing all of the woes of how athletics affect colleges, he cops out and says they still have a place.  I think this shows just how tough the problem is.  It was interesting that quite a bit of his reading overlapped mine, and in fact, he agreed with me that Rick Telander, Sports Illustrated writer and former college football player, had a worthwhile solution of making college \\"pro\\" sports optional for colleges.<br />He also had great discussions of the personalities of coaches and athletic directors and how that affects the programs, as well as discussions on how the media can harm college athletics.  Sports journalists don't score high on his list.<br />This book doesn't solve any problems but does give a different and insightful analysis of the challenge.  I recommend this book to those trying to understand the finances of college athletics and how an athletic department exists inside a major university.	2001-04-16

It attempts to be a current day update of the Benjamin Graham \\"Value Investing\\" philosophy but it's really a current day value investing book written in layman's terms.<br />If you believe in value investing or if you want to easily understand the principal, then this is the book for you.  It's a very quick read, which can be finished in less than five hours, as it has less than 200 pages.<br />The actual philosophy of value investing and points to look for in a company were brief, concise and very well written.  The most valuable part of the book to me was the chapters on value investing overseas where foreign stock exchange results were compared with America.  I came away with a better understanding and believe that opportunities for investing overseas would be desirable from a value and diversification standpoint.<br />A good &quot;skim&quot; read on a tough subject that I still recommend to the right audience.	2001-04-16

But since I wasn't interested in a novel on politics, I let this book sit on the shelf for a year.  Upon picking it up, I was once again mired in the web Stuart Woods so quickly spins around his readers.  I've yet to find another novelist who so quickly holds the reader.  If there is a weakness with his books however, it sometimes seems he has to wrap up too many subplot loose ends at the end.  Some of these subplots may not even be necessary.<br />Irrespective, I have always enjoyed his books and have already preordered his next one due within a month.  Be prepared to take a few jabs if you are a Republican and supported the Clinton impeachment, as Woods' political persuasion is easy to pick up in this book.

But this is clearly not an enjoyable subject.  Written by a college professor of Chinese descent, the author wants to prove that the Japanese brutalized the city of Nanking.  Since there were attempts to cover it up at the time, she seems intent on proving the &quot;Rape&quot; as fact.  Frankly, I have no problem believing it.  But this book quickly resorts to repeated tales of horror that are all about the same and eventually it was boring and I looked forward to the end.<br />Probably the best part of the book is when she told of the foreigners in the city who attempted to valiantly defend the citizens against the atrocities.  This was inspiring and interesting since it involved both Nazis and Americans.<br />This book has historical significance so it will appeal to history buffs as she clearly spent quite a bit of time on her research.  But don't expect a pleasurable read and I can't really recommend the book as I found it so depressing.  And that was probably her point in focusing on this atrocity that many consider to be as bad as the Holocaust.	2001-03-19

After reading &quot;The Nightingale Song&quot;, which covers Webb's career at Annapolis and Washington, I was compelled to read this book.  A conservative person who fought valiantly but underwent a metamorphis after the war and became more liberal, this book was clearly a method to exorcise the pain of the war for Webb.<br />Unfortunately, I was traveling when I read this and read in many short periods.  I became extremely engrossed in the battle tales but failed to connect with the characters as well as I would have liked.  Irrespective, I would agree that this sounds like the most realistic book describing what it was like to be in the field in Vietnam.  But Webb covered much more than just a platoon that suffers heavy casualties.  A brief part of the book covers a young officer in Okinawaw who develops a love interest with a young Japanese girl with the relevant cultural issues that arise when he proposes.<br />The battle scenes are mezmerizing like the three men sent outside the perimeter stupidly by command who are terribly overrun and must lay wounded in the midst of the enemy all night.  In many respects this book seemed to closely parallel the movie Platoon.<br />But the most unexpected part of the book was the dialog from the Vietnamese scout who was a former Viet Cong who defects only to have his family killed.  This was great perspective on what was going on in the minds of the Vietnamese people who generally hated the Americans for their brutal treatment.<br />In summary, I think this is a very important book by a very decorated and brave individual that shows the mental conflicts and pain of war. I encourage you to read this if you want to learn of the brutality of war.  But this is not a light read and will challenge your feelings of the war.	2001-02-17

But it had enough surprises that I couldn't put the book down and read this quickly in two days.  Reading the maps, you know an accident occurs but until you read about the accident and how it affects the two individuals involved in the climb, you really can't appreciate the struggles these men went through.  Climbing such treacherous mountains requires perfect teamwork.  This accident challenged the teamwork and the commitment of the climbers.  By describing the critical events from the perspective of both men, it's really gripping to see how it affects both men.<br />This is a very short book and very quick read.  I strongly recommend this book for an exciting read.  My only complaint was that the technical mountaineering talk was over my head.  Only later did I discover the glossary at the end that would have partially helped with this.	2001-02-17

This time the story is a lowly Division 1 basketball conference that was formed under the premise of not issuing scholarships, therefore the title of the book.  This book is at it's best examining personal stories of individual players.  How they got here, family issues effecting college educations, and the personal motivation that keeps kids playing basketball without significant minutes or monetary reward are covered in detail with brillance.  Of course, the most famous is the worst player on the worst team in the worst conference in Division 1a basketball who uses that as a pick-up line.  But many more stories are just as funny or touching including the stories of the coaches.<br />The author is at his best telling these individual stories or commenting on how these true amatuers play for the challenge of competitive sports.  You find yourself wishing all college sports could go back to true students who are athletes.  Where the author failed was in overlaying these stories and moral questions around the complete season covering all the teams.  There are just too many names and too many teams to keep track of.  My first thought was that he should have had a diagram page in the center section showing the players on each team and where they finished the year.  But that might not have cured the problem.  Maybe he should have selected a couple of teams and overlayed their seasons with short stories of the other teams as they were played.  Or maybe he should have written more in short story form with each chapter covering a team.  Irrespective, it's just too much data for a reader looking for enjoyment. I do recommend this book and found the good outweighs the bad.  Just be forwarned of the confusion, particularly in the middle of the book.<br />As a matter of disclosure, I did not attend nor have any interest in any of the colleges mentioned in the book as many previous readers have had.previous readers have had.	2001-01-16

The first part of the book covers this and provided a perfect synopsis for the movie, My Dog Skip.<br />The second part of the book covers his time in Texas where he attended college and stayed to become an editor of a local liberal paper. He also was the school paper editor who became famous for his liberal stances taking on the administration. While this section gets long, it is the most interesting section as Morris is thrown in a foreign environment, becomes quite intimidated as many freshman do, and then grows in the process. This growth culminates in his acceptance as a Rhodes Scholar competing against many Ivy League namedroppers who once again intimidate him. He graduates and eventually writes for a liberal paper in Texas covering politics which allows him to see this magnificent state and challenge the beliefs of politicians and himself as he has grown into a full liberal in a very conservative state. Significant time is spent coloring the political landscape of the time and it's quite interesting to view this from 40 years hence. Anyone remember the John Birch Society?<br />The final section was an evolution as he moves to New York, goes through the humiliating first job search before he finds a low paying job working for Harpers Magazine. He describes what it's like working in New York, which he calls the \\"Cave\\", and living in substandard conditions where the sun never hits his building. He describes his first literary party and the pompous attitude of these intellectuals, particularly about the rest of the country. This becomes the fascinating introspective part of the book as he parallels his life in the South and his existence living in the \\"Cave\\".<br />This book covers the 40's,50's and 60's so clearly race was a central theme as the civil rights movement was in boom causing him to challenge so much of what he knew growing up. I think this culminates when he asks a German woman to leave his apartment after she makes some mild racist Jewish remarks. Morris really struggled reconciling the race issue given his background in Mississippi and at one point when he was introduced, he said he was from North Carolina as he had become embarrassed to mention being from Mississippi.<br />It's a fascinating story of personal growth that any reader will learn from. The book closes with him moving out of the Cave to a 70 mile, 4 hour commute daily to the city. And the last paragraph states the title \\"North Toward Home\\". I think many people will take the close differently but to me he was accepting his new home and turning over the page on the South which he would always appreciate and remember fondly.<br />This book will be of interest to Southerners looking to learn about their heritage and what living in the South in the segregated 1940's was like. Also, people with interests in journalism and political history will enjoy the book. But this book is also good for anyone looking for personal growth through the writings of others. I recommend books on whether they are entertaining and whether I learn much. I was pleasently entertained and learned a great deal. I strongly recommend this book.nd 60's so clearly race was a central theme as the civil rights movement was in boom causing him to challenge so much of what he knew growing up.

Each chapter is from the perspective of a different character.  Frankly, I found this strategy confusing and difficult to follow.  Particularly if you couldn't remember some of the minor characters.  That aside, this book does an excellent job of showing what a coach's wife's life is like.  Everyone knows coaches work long hours.  Kincaid shows the real toll on the family.<br />What's not fully brought out in the publicity of the book is that it also deals with race relations in the south as well as that area of the country's obsession with college football.  This book gives another perspective of the vicious tactics used by boosters when a coach is not performing to their expectations.<br />What is also interesting is that Ms. Kincaid is married to Dick Tomey, the Arizona coach who recently resigned after great success because the pressures from fans were just too great.  Kincaid's biography touches on the fact that she was previously married to another coach who worked at Alabama (clearly the fictional school in the book) and Arkansas State.  My guess is she may have formerly been married to Ray Perkins but none of the articles I read gave her first husband's name.  If you know, please email me.<br />In summary, I enjoyed this book and read it in two days.  It touches many important points about college athletics and race relations.	2000-12-24

The book does a good job of summarizing Craig's life from a family tragedy that shaped his business life, to his strong belief in cellular communication and how that made him a millionaire.<br />The good news/bad news is that he eschews the fame and glory of a typical egomaniac like Donald Trump.  It's great from a role model standpoint but since McCaw is so protective of his privacy and is around so few people, it was difficult to write a glamorous tale of an unglamorous life.  Particularly since there is no mention of McCaw ever being interviewed by the author.  Therefore, you are left with the history of cellular phone development in America coupled with mention of McCaw's unique management style.<br />That was enough for me as I had no knowledge of the business and it was interesting to see how a conservative man leveraged himself to great wealth.  But don't buy this book if you want stories of drugs, models or other scandals.  This story is nothing more than a successful business tale and that is enough.	2000-12-18

Some parts are mesmerizing but unfortunately a few parts read a little slow and will take some time to read this book.  In addition, I found the chronology of the book to be somewhat confusing as it appeared many of the facts were assumed to be known.  For example, he closes the book with the discussion of Iran-Contra but at one point I felt like I had actually skipped a chapter as there was so much reference to it in fairly high depth.<br />Irrespective of my slight complaints, I still enjoyed this book and learned quite a bit.  This book overlays the history of 5 Annapolis grads, how they grew and how they changed, and how many of them eventually resurfaced in a serious scandal in the Reagon administration.  The stories from Annapolis were fascinating.  One of my favorites was North's fight to graduate after continually being put back due to a devastating injury.<br />Probably my favorite part of the book was the Vietnam war stories.  There are some true American heros covered and it is very inspiring.  From McCain's 5 years as a POW to Webb and North's tales of battlefield heroics, this book will send chills up your back.  He also overlays the country's growing distrust of the war and how it affected these men.<br />The Post Vietnam era covers these men as they reintorduce themselves to nonmilitary life or in some cases continued academic pursuits. I was not aware while in the service some officers could extend their education in such a variety of fields.  It is very impressive.<br />As the men mature through their experiences, you can see vast changes in some of the men.  Some grow to the heights of their profession, one becomes a novelist related to his war experiences as well as politically moving on the spectrum.<br />The book draws to it's conclusion as all of these men end up in Washington around the Reagon Presidency.  The reader gets an excellent look at Reagon's governing style, or lack thereof.  It's very interesting.  But you also get a look at men trained to do what they are told without question, and how that can turn badly in Iran-Contra.  Still, it's touching to see many of their comrades support them in their time of need.<br />This is a great book to learn more about the political system of America.  It's a great book to learn about the military life and it's different perspective on the Vietnam War and politics.  I'm sure everyone will have their personal favorites of the 5 characters and while I learned from all of them, I found Jim Webb's journey to novelist and Democrat leaning politics to be fascinating.  Books like this should be required reading for Americans.'s very interesting.

It's disappointing to read the negative reviews which place blame on this man for his lifestyle.  I don't disagree with this thought but the point of this book is to share a lifestyle leading to crime and back, and to analyze what his influences  were that led him there.<br />McCall came from a two-person middle class background, hardly a ghetto environment, but he still drifted into a life of crime.  If ever a book shows the peer influence while in high school, this is it.  After he had shot a man and was waiting at the police headquarters, he shares his thoughts as the realization of what he has done hits him.  Also, while walking across a college campus after his prison term, he recognizes a victim of one of his &quot;gang rapes&quot;.  The remorse he feels is interesting as is his inability to try and confront and apologize to this person.  Truly, Mr. McCall was remorseful of his bad deeds and now recognizes how this period of crime almost ruined his life.<br />This book also shows what life in prison is like and you watch McCall start to realize how easy it would be for him to fall in this trap.  But the last part of the book, and clearly the most controversial, deals with his life after he lands a good journalism job and is required to function in a world in constant touch with the white community.  He does a good job of showing the difference in cultures and how he struggles.  Clearly, McCall is a bitter man and even he doesn't understand totally why.  It reminds me of the MTV shows &quot;Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot; where the black males tend to be distant and have a tougher time communicating with their roomates.<br />There's two ways to look at this book. One, use this book to reaffirm your stereotype of the black community and culture. Two, learn what goes on in the mind of a black man growing up in a confusing environment to him and how he deals with it.  It's your choice.  I choose to learn about his lifestyle and find ways to make such individuals more productive in today's society.a confusing environment to him and how he deals with it.  It's your choice.

How could the ultimate comedian from the 70s and well known movie star, write a story about lonliness and love of a 20 something female?  I had previously not read Martin's books and after finishing this one, I'm still not sure I understand the message.<br />Martin follows a Shopgirl under medication for depression as she struggles with weak dates but eventually lands in the arms of an older man who clearly uses her for sex.  But this heavy subject always reads very light through his touch.  He paints a vivid  picture of the everyday life of an everyday Los Angelino.<br />This is a very quick read that will be finished in one plane ride.  But don't focus too much on the shopgirl because the real question is how did this spring from the mind of Steve Martin?	2000-11-29

Yes, it starts a little slow as he sets the stage from his young life.  And the chapters on his involvement with communism do not fully explain what his attraction to communism was.  But I think after much research and book reading, this book allowed me to get as close as I could to the answer.  And the answer is, in the current political environment of my life, you can never fully understand the travesty of the depression and the Spanish issues in the 30s and therefore, we can never totally feel why free Americans would feel so strongly about communism.  So, I've finally closed my research on this subject thanks to Ring Lardner, Jr.<br />This book has some great highlights which should be cherished by the readers.  Dalton Trumbo may be the most celebrated of the Hollywood 10 and his humorous attempts to write and get credit for writing are quite interesting during the Blacklist period.  The book correctly conveys the lives which were altered or damaged by this horrible period in America freedom.<br />Another interesting subject is the few movies that are mentioned showing how the screenwriting process changed the movie completely from the original story.  For example, I had read the great sports novel, &quot;Semi-tough&quot;,  by Dan Jenkins.  Lardner wrote a screenplay and a new director had it completely rewrote focusing not on football but on mystical self-improvement gurus.  I had always wondered how a movie could so butcher a very funny book so it was nice to get closure on a 30 year old question.<br />Lardner wrote and won an Academy Award for &quot;Mash&quot;.  This provides more interesting reading on a movie which is still significant in the landscape of American cinema.<br />The next to last chapter provides a look not at history but directly into the soul of this interesting man.  What starts out as a description of growing old turns into an exceptional essay on his beliefs or nonbeliefs in religeon.  Regardless of your feelings, this is fascinating chapter that may challenge your own beliefs.<br />In closing, I believe you will enjoy this read of a man who led a full life suffering through the Hollywood 10 tragedy and early deaths of brothers in Spain and WWII.  I recommend this book specifically to readers interested in Hollywood, American history in the 20th century, or biographies of famous writers.our feelings, this is fascinating chapter that may challenge your own beliefs.<br />In closing, I believe you will enjoy this read of a man who led a full life suffering through the Hollywood 10 tragedy and early deaths of brothers in Spain and WWII.

I do live in Memphis which was featured in the book and am subjected to how ingrained football culture is to the South. This book does an exceptional job of relaying this and while the author is a fan, he covers some of the taboo areas and allows the reader to make some judgements.<br />The writer discloses early that his father played football and he played baseball at Tennessee. I think he did a fair job of not being overly biased although clearly there are more stories about Tennessee and semi-negative stories about their chief rival, Alabama. Be forewarned that this book does not cover all schools but instead focuses on selected short stories. Schools covered are Tn, Fl, Ala., Ga., Vandy, Auburn and LSU with at least one featured chapter.<br />Exceptional chapters covered Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer, coaches at Fl and TN. I learned a lot about football from these chapters and came away with greater respect for both men. The Florida/Tn and Florida/GA rivalry are covered in depth and present a great backdrop of what players, fans and coaches endure at an SEC football weekend. Also, the chapters on the Vandy player and Vandy coach give you greater respect for their outlook on football.<br />The chapters that create the most controversy will be on recruiting. He follows the recruiting of a nationally ranked Memphis player, Albert Means.  Needless to say, it is not too positive with allusions of cheating but no real proof. The most controversial chapter is 6 where he highlights a wealthy Memphis businessman, Logan Young, who is supposedly buying players for Alabama, and Roy Adams, a talkative, obsessed fan for Tennessee who likes to get close to players, real close. This chapter highlights everything that is wrong with college football with these grown men's obsession with 18 year old boys. Clearly Logan Young loses the writer's popularity vote as the Alabama fan who supposedly buys players. But here is where the writer's research fails him. Mr. Adams, the other fan, who clearly enjoys being the center of attention, brags about being close to players and can't understand why past TN coaches have been rude to him about his meddling with players. I'm surprised the author did not explore this issue and question what this individual's &quot;real&quot; agenda is. He admits to having players over to his house and it wouldn't take much research to find this out. As stated in the book, the writer took a lot of his information from Internet chat lines. Maybe a little more time should have been spent interviewing people in Memphis about this individual and players that had been to his house. Logan Young would still have come across poorly but I suspect most readers would be outraged by the other gentleman's interests.<br />The writer does a good job of trying to act like an impartial observer and while it's clear that he loves football, in the last chapter he touches on how this obsession can be negative for fans and players. It's a business. And all for &quot;Bragging Rights&quot; so one fan can say for a short period of time, &quot;I'm better than you.&quot;t here is where the writer's research fails him.

Not nearly as good but still a fascinating read of a &quot;fast lane&quot; life.  Frankly, it was a little long and too much time was spent in describing elements of the &quot;job&quot; without getting to the plot line which rapidly comes together in the last part of the book.<br />The book is about girls of the &quot;Golddigger&quot; profession.  It must be interesting research and leaves you wandering how true it is.  Irregardless, Felske has something to say about life in the fast lane and I enjoy his novels.  Not his best work and doesn't really attach the reader to the characters as well as &quot;Word&quot; but still an enjoyable &quot;beach&quot; read.	2000-11-02

This is the perfect book to analyze the effects of college sports on institutions of higher learning but also much more. This books starts by classifying students into four basic groups and describes what are the motivations of each group as it relates to a college education. I found this to be a very elementary but appropriate evaluation which clarifies why some things are as they are. The author also had sent out surveys, although not scientifically done, from which to draw conclusions. It nevertheless, was insightful concerning students feelings about athletics and their education.<br />The surprise for me in this book was the historical analysis of college enrollment and marketing to prespective students in the last thirty years.  Included in this, the author was very critical of the &quot;learning environment&quot; and teachers who want to research but not teach. This was a subject which I had not seen so effectively addressed.<br />Yes, Murray Sperber is critical of college athletics. But I think his presentation was as balanced as possible with this bias and spared no one in his recommendations for improvement.<br />Without giving away the ending, his conclusion is titled, &quot;What should happen vs. what probably will happen.&quot; The author has given his subject great thought and presented the reader with good evidence. But I think the author realizes he is tilting at windmills and the ultimate conclusion which may come within 10 years will be painful. Particularly for a dedicated educator.	2000-10-19

But that would be small minded to not enjoy the history of an exceptional Southern American family.<br />I throughly enjoyed reading this memoir from Archie about his life and journey to sports.  He is an exceptional human being with many fine qualities.  It's all here: 1. His feelings of the college game, 2. Inducements he may have received at Ole Miss, 3. His feelings of race, 4. life in the NFL, and 5. the good and bad of Southern passion for football and how it effected the recruiting of his sons.<br />Peyton also wrote some sections and did an excellent job.  It's interesting to read his perceptions on such subjects as confrontations with coaches as well as his Tn freshman competition with Brandon Stewart.  The story shows his passion and obsession with football and reading some of his stories, you can see where he probably generated some enemies amongst his teamates.  He closes one chapter with thoughts of the college game and whether eventually there will be  minor league pro teams.<br />Cooper Manning comes off as the star.  What a great guy.  You can see Cooper knew how to charm parents, classmates and his parents.<br />Eli is projected as a quiet, shy kid much like Archie and Olivia is the rock of the family.<br />I strongly recommend this book if you like football, southern culture, or stories about inspiring American families.	2000-10-18

That was an exceptional movie and I thought I would relive the era through Ben fong-Torres, who was featured in the movie.<br />The book is really a reprint of many of his stories in Rolling Stone which the reviews probably stated and I didn't focus on.  I would have preferred his story of being close to the Rock and Roll scene.  Reading some of the articles that were over 20 years old became somewhat boring and outdated.  I did learn quite a bit in some of the stories and Fong-Torres does provide some narrative on each story although it is limited.  Overall though, I'd take a pass on this one and look for another if you are looking for a good book about rock in the 70's and 80's.	2000-10-18

Telander is a former player in college  and is watching the game he played be ruined.  But he honestly discloses  more than once that what is being said now has been said since the  1930s.<br />Maybe Telander should stop tilting at windmills and just give up  to fight another fight and that may be my feelings also.  But then you read  his well-thought suggestions for changing the game and you see they could  solve the problem.  Let big colleges run  professional sports team for  entertainment and segment other colleges.  The players would be paid and  would not be required to attend college.  The suggestions are fascinating  and seem to address most of the points of weakness in the problem.  All it  will take is backbone from the college presidents and a few other powerful  players.  Oh, well.  There goes this problem as no one associated has  backbone.  Witness the Oklahoma president presiding in the late 80s who  years later tries to downplay the problems he faced.  Witness Walter Byers  who presided over the NCAA and now has his own book stating that there is a  problem and it should be solved.  Where were you years ago Mr. Byers?<br />If you love college football, you should read this book.  Maybe it won't  change your mind but it should at least let you see there is a problem. And  Mr. Telander still doesn't cover football.  Nice boycott.	2000-08-26

Their careers are so intertwined, he already had the research.  And, in  fact, you could almost call this a history of the Negro Baseball  League.<br />The negatives to the book are that it early reads somewhat like a  rehash of newspaper articles.  The author was forced into this because the  two primary sources were the weekly black newspapers and  &quot;embellished&quot; word of mouth.  The set-up is a little long on the  history of the two Pittsburgh teams that Josh played for but since this  rivalry was so intertwined with Josh's history, it was almost necessary.<br />The positives are that this is a classic &quot;tragic hero&quot;.  Humble beginnings and tragedy, develops into a tremendous player, personal  flaws erode his skills, and then he has a young, controversial death.  When  you overlay that with the rumors and embellishment of his accomplishments,  it's easy to see how the legend has grown.  The author did a good job of  balancing legend with documentable evidence helping the reader draw a  conclusion on the stories that may be overstated exaggerations.<br />This is a  great story and a very good read I enjoyed.  Obviously, Josh Gibson and  Satch Paige paved the way for Jackie Robinson and have their place in  baseball history.  I STRONGLY encourage you to watch &quot;The Soul of the  Game&quot; on HBO which takes the history of Paige, Gibson and Robinson and  overlays the facts into a reconstruction.  It was one of the best movies I  have ever watched and never fails to draw you emotionally into the story.  This book and it's careful research, allowed me to realize virtually every  scene in the movie was drawn from some fact and not an overstatement.	2000-08-20

I give the writers credit for  overlaying the story over a compelling basketball season, but it was  sometimes confusing with so many chapters focusing on the many subplots.  Maybe too much was too little.<br />I enjoyed the book and the ending does  draw you in to the happy ending for at least one of the player's wives.  But these writers will need to continue to sharpen their story lines to  create a novel that generates emotional involvement throughout the novel.<br />Not for sports enthusiasts but for romance novel readers.	2000-08-14

That dates back to the 20s and therefore you must invest  about 100 pages before you get to the story of Heaven's Gate.<br />But once  you get to the Heaven's Gate section, the old story of Hollywood excess,  greed and ego takes over.  Cimino may take the prize for egos and that's  saying a lot.<br />I enjoyed this book and bought it for the historical  significance it has in modern Hollywood history.  I was not disappointed  but be prepared for a long read.	2000-08-01

If he were alive today, he clearly would be staggered by the number of people who took the time to listen.<br />I bought  this book two years ago based on great reviews but couldn't get excited  about reading a book about death.  I even skipped the movie.  But after  finally picking it up, I throughly enjoyed the quick, insightful read that  makes everyone re-examine their life's values, including me.<br />Morrie was  clearly an exceptional human being.  We've all had great teachers but this  guy was the ultimate with the joy and love he took in his craft.  Mitch  Albom is a typical American caught in the American dream without realizing  there is a problem.  I applaud Mitch for writing this book and softly  admitting some of his past sins.  My only complaint is that I wish Mitch  had been able to more definitely conclude the issues he may or may not have  with his brother.<br />But this is Morrie's book.  I spent the next day trying  to recall if I had met anyone quite like him.  It's difficult to live up to  the high standards he sets.  An excellent read and excellent lessons we  should all remember.	2000-08-01

This is a fascinating race in extreme conditions which the author describes very well based on his first hand knowledge.  But he also  analyzes what went wrong and where the blame should be placed if anywhere.  The pictures are exceptional and this is an excellent read with a few slow  spots.<br />However, it is not my favorite sailing adventure.  That would be  Fatal Storm, the Inside Story of the Sydney-Hobart race.  While it may not  have taught as much, the stories were more in-depth and mesmerizing.<br />This  book has historical importance from a sailing perspective as it was one of  the first races of the modern era with catastrophic results and much was  learned for equipment development.  A must read for sailors and adventure  junkies.  Also good for someone wanting to learn about the technical side  of racing and weather.	2000-07-15

I watched the movie many times before I was aware it was from a novel. I eagerly awaited my read but found the movie not true to the book at all.  In this case, that was a positive.  Even with Andrew McCarthey's weak  characterization in the movie, the characters are much more compelling in  the movie than the book.  There is really no one in this to like.<br />As  other reviewers have said, when you get a book with many great reviews and  some totally disappointing reviews, it's probably something you should  check out for your own taste.  This may be such a book.  I didn't get.  Maybe you will.  Great American literature?  Not on your life!	2000-07-03

But this book lost some of it's interest in the last 100 pages as the plots begin to look exactly the same.  Why did we need the ex-govenor back in  this book?  Couldn't his role have been handled by Twilley since they are  both insane eco-freaks?<br />Irrespective, I am glad I read this but didn't  find it near as interesting as Striptease.  There is no doubt that Hiaasen  loves the Florida landscape.  It may be time he take a different tack to  getting that message across or try a new message.  I will continue to read  reviewers of his new books but may not be able to continue to invest the  time to read them if they continue to be all the same.	2000-07-03

I give this book strong marks for &quot;fairly&quot; addressing the taboo of black sports superiority.  He cites other books which had &quot;hidden&quot;  agendas and sounds believable that he is not supportive of that  agenda.<br />But the book had obvious weakness.  He early in the books states  his general thesis.  I kept waiting for more in-depth knowledge supporting  his position but frankly it was not forthcoming.<br />The second part of the  book discussed evolution in depth which I found very boring.  But  immediately after this, there were great discussions about the history of  black sports in America as well as race relations in that period.  During  this section, Jewish domination of basketball in the 40s-50s was discussed  which I found interesting as I had no knowledge of this.<br />The book moved  into the last section which I expected to be a conclusion with more  in-depth support.  Unfortunately, it was not forthcoming, only a general  repeat as stated in the first section.<br />From the breakdowns of the  sections above, you can see I found some parts of the book interesting and  some quite boring.  But the more I thought of this book, the more I  realized it did provide a valuable function; to make you think about a  &quot;taboo&quot; subject.  For presenting a controversial subject in an  unbiased manner and generating thought, I have to give this book reasonably  high marks.  Some people will hate this book and some will love it.  But  maybe, more importantly, it provided a balanced view of a difficult subject  for the majority of readers to draw their own conclusions.	2000-06-24

Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Thought provoking approach to finance and a quick read	This is a very quick, enjoyable read.  This book focuses on an issue I had never really thought about: breaking the cycle of working at a job for a living.  Ironically, he recommends you do just that while you start your  own business on the side.<br />He does brag about some of his investments even  though he says he doesn't mean to.  He also has some &quot;unique&quot; and  speculative investing strategies like tax receipts.  But the focus of this  book should be on changing the cycle of living up to your salary and  instead saving money for investing.  He is a conservative man who leverages  his winnings, evidently quite successfully.  Should be required reading for  all college graduates and is the next present for my daughter.	2000-06-24

They deal with the climb from his prespective. His writing style and comments can be very humorous at times in dealing with this massive trauma he was facing.  Clearly, he looked death in the eye and has come out a better man.  I  started this late at night and couldn't put it down until I finished this  section.<br />The rest of the book deals with his family relationships (poor)  and his early struggles with depression.  There is no question this reads  slower but I am still glad I read it. Clearly, his marriage was on the  rocks from his noncaring attitude and he admits as much.  Climbers may not  like this part of the book but if you are involved in a intense personal  relationship but have lived your life as an &quot;A&quot; type individual,  read this to learn what might happen to you.  At one point, he admits the  accident was a positive experience for his interpersonal relationships even  though he lost his hands.  That's a powerful statement.<br />This book has  something for everyone but maybe not enough for any particular type person.  I applaud Beck Weathers and wish him, his wife and his kids well.  I  enjoyed the book but make sure you're ready for both sides of the story.  Hard core climbers who are only in it for the thrill may be disappointed  with Beck's life lessons.	2000-06-19

I was pleased and somewhat let down.<br />The book has two distinct  parts but needs a third.  First, he quickly explains why he was a member of  the communist party.  I still believe this fascination was a liberal  viewpoint which was carried to an extreme given the recent depression.  This section discussing life in Hollywood under fear of subpeona was very  interesting and compelling as written from a struggling  screenwriter.<br />Section 2 then deals with his life as a screenwriter  working mainly in Spain and Paris.  This section really didn't deal with  the politics of the time but instead is a personal memoir into his life in  the business.  I learned a lot of the movie business from a different  perspective but actually found this part to run a little long. His  description of his side trips in Europe was also very interesting.<br />There are two important pieces I felt were left out.  A more in-depth  discussion of his involvement with communism and his current feelings.  When he came back to America he talks of how pleasing the return was but he  never closes the chapter on what his current feelings are about communism.  I think anyone that condemns this man's thoughts without listening are  short-sighted.  But I also think that he should more fully explain his  thoughts, how they have developed and what his thinking is now since that  was the premise for the book.<br />The final item left out of the book were  the last 20?  years of his life.  Since I invested this much time reading  about him, at least he could have given a short description of what he has  been doing once he left the business.  What's happened in the last few  years.  He mentions what his daughter is doing.  What about him?  He does  mention his wife dying and I was very touched as they seem to have had a  very good marriage in a business where there are so few.<br />Overall, I  enjoyed this book.  It taught me and showed me a life with which I was not  familiar. It also addressed some of my unanswered questions as to the  fascination with Communism in the mid-century.  But it also left some  questions unanswered.  If the Author reads this review, I wish he would  contact me and explain some of his beliefs in further depth than the book.touched as they seem to have had a  very good marriage in a business where there are so few.<br />Overall, I  enjoyed this book.

Reading of his struggle with cancer and  how he dealt with it was the most inspiring part. Also the testimonial from  his former girlfriend was enjoyable. Unfortunately, the writer was very  jumpy and didn't consistently tell the story. The parts on trading were  particularly boring and not helpful.

This book is a mixed bag, some good, some not so good.  Here is what I liked about this book: As a fan of the movie, &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, this book gives a chapter describing how he wrote the screenplay, his  influences that made Streisand's character, and his disagreements with  Pollack.  This was a great highlight and worth the read.  He also had an  interesting life, particularly during WWII and his years in Hollywood.  Also, the descriptions of his involvement in &quot;Gypsy&quot; and  &quot;West Side Story&quot; are great.<br />What I didn't like:  Laurents has  a problem to this day which permeates throughout the book with the  informers during the Hollywood Witch Hunt.  That's great but he never  bothered to explain his involvement in the communist party, if any as it is  never really mentioned, and why he took that stance.  As an intelligent  man, he should be able to discuss both sides of the argument or at least  document that he took a stance that by many could be considered  controversial.  this is very disappointing.  Also, the book jumped back and  forth in time and I found it confusing sometimes.<br />Overall, I consider  this a good read with some slow parts.  It is over 400 pages in smaller  print and admittedly took me longer to get through than most of the books I  read.  I don't have a real theatre interest but if you do then I would  strongly encourage you to read this book.  It also gives good detail about  the entertainment business during the time period of 1945-1970. Read this  book to be entertained and learn.	2000-06-04

This book helped to fill in some of the holes to help my game.  It is a very easy, quick read.  I didn't like that it went so much into minor details  like what is in the tennis bag.  What I really liked was the blow by blow  description of how he won some big matches against Becker and McEnroe.  Also, his explanation of basic strategy types was very good.  I've watched  Brad play many matches live and he is a master at mentally undressing his  opponent.  He is a perfect guy to write this book.

Unfortunately, the first part of the book is very slow until the tennis partner, David, discloses his personal weakness.  As a tennis player with no interest in medical study, I learned quite a  lot. The payoff of the emotional ending is worth the read.

Unfortunately, the clear bias that they didn't like their jobs is too strong.  Nothing good was said about any Managing Directors.  Now surely,  we could find some social, redeeming value in a person you worked for when  you worked for so many?  Or maybe controversy and criticism sells  better.<br />The book goes into extreme detail of the mundane tasks of an  I-banker, ie, copy duties, word processing duties.  Do we really need a  chapter on these subjects?  They leave the impression that they never used  their brain at all and the whole profession is a shame.  Isn't that a  little strong?  I particularly like his comment in due diligence that  beginning attorneys are lower than I-Bankers.  I thought that was a little  self-serving.<br />I don't underestimate the hard work the authors  put in and  while I think they could have included some positives of their job, I did  learn how mundane the job can be and recommend this book to anyone  interested in finance and particularly a career on Wall Street.  Everyone  knows the risk/reward of making big money on Wall Street.  Yes, maybe you  have to sacrifice horribly to have a chance to be a managing director.  But  the rewards are so great, it's understandable why so many people try.  In  the end, maybe these two guys were a little soft or just didn't want it bad  enough.  Irregardless, I enjoyed the read but just wish it had had more  &quot;meat&quot; in the subjects.	2000-05-27

One of my memories was of Mike Doyle coming to WindanSea when he was the world's top-rated surfer.  As a 12 year old, the thing I remember most was the Amazon gorgeous girls following him  around.<br />When I heard about this book, I thought it might be interesting  to see what happened to him.  This is a great book from a man who has led  an interesting life.  For those of us who were in California when surfing  culture first hit the world, this book means a lot.  What is really  interesting is hearing Mike talk about the times and how he was right in  the middle of the culture.  It was so carefree back then.  It's amazing how  many critical surfing &quot;events&quot; he was involved in.  Almost like  surfing's Forrest Gump.  It was also interesting hearing him survive the  70s.<br />The book talks about how Mike has had some downs over the years.  Frankly, I wish he had delved more into his personal life.<br />It ends with  Mike being the ultimate surfer and continuing to lead his life in Mexico.  I found his email address and expressed my satisfaction from the book.  He  was polite enough to answer in the &quot;Mike Doyle&quot; persona.<br />If  you want to know what the surfing culture was really like, read this book.	2000-05-27

I learned quite a bit in this book such as Dennis was broke and kicked out of the band a fair amount of the time, his  relationship with Christy McVie, his feuds with Mike Love.  But I struggled  with some of the organization and the lack of depth on some of the  material.<br />For example, most of the first part of the book explores the  music of the Beach Boys somewhat chronologically.  There is some personal  development also in these early chapters but not full developed.  Then it  has a chapter on Charlie Manson afterwhich it goes mainly into his demise  and problems with the Beach Boys later in his career.  My main complaint  was the lack of information about his personal life.  His first wife is  mentioned as well as the kids but no real development of the relationship  other than implying infidelities of a rock star. The same also applies for  his last wife. There was more information about his middle wife, Karen  Lamm.  She is so beautiful, I wish there were more pictures of her as well  as other personal pictures.  Most of the pictures were just of the Beach  Boys.<br />I did learn a lot about his music development and obviously the  author has a strong background in music.  And I also learned enough about  Dennis personally that I would recommend the book.  However, it could have  been so much better with more in-depth journalism into his other personal  relationships. He is clearly a fascinating subject.	2000-05-19

Frankly, I found it disappointing and the more I think about it, the less appealing I remember it.  There were images of the Southern real  estate developer which really captured the essence of the south as well as  the mentality of a real estate developer, boom or bust.  Also, the bank  work-out specialist was interesting to watch.  While the factory worker was  a sympathetic character, at times I felt like I was reading two novels and  tying them together was done very poorly with no real feeling.<br />The final  professional move by Croker is bizarre and unrewarding.  I encourage  everyone to ignore the hype and skip this book.  Maybe you'll like it but  the time investment to read this many pages and take the risk of being  disappointed is just not worth it.	2000-05-15

It takes his life and tries to  disspell rumors and exaggerations and find the truth.  It's very sad how  the life of Crazy Horse ended and you can't help feel for the plight of the  Indians.  I enjoyed reading this as a cultural study but not for a fun,  enjoyable read.  If you are looking for a typical novel, then don't buy  this book. If you are looking information and want to learn about the  plight of Indians, then this is the book for you.	2000-05-15

This book was even better.  Osman is a fascinating individual completely consumed with rock climbing.  His feats of free-fall are bizarre  and will leave you mezmerized.  But if you test fate too much, bad things  happen.<br />While rock climbing is the center of this book, Osman was more  than a climber.  It's interesting to a guy who works at least 8 hours a day  to read about a man who works only to support his &quot;rock climbing  habit&quot;.  Osman was also a unique individual and I feel for his  daughter having to grow up without this unique individual in her life.	2000-05-15

This one missed the mark.  In fact, I kept struggling to finish it and was very happy to move on to my next book.<br />I didn't find the jokes overtly funny although there  is some that are humorous.  ON the bright side, the character development  of Dandy is over the top and funny.  The lead character's love life is  casually developed with no real conclusion.  Most of the other characters  are just not funny.<br />Maybe I'm too old to get it.  However,  &quot;Word&quot; by Felske is a much better read of the Hollywood  lifestyle.  I also found &quot;California Screamin&quot; a better read than  this one and it really qualifies as a gay romance novel.	2000-05-13

I work in the business but not on Wall Street. I have read quite a few books on the business and this is one of the more forgettable.  It possibly would be interesting to someone who doesn't know much about the business  and it does attempt to be funny, but frankly, it's really not.

When I decided to read this book, I actually started with another book on the subject recommended by Sports Illustrated.  Based on Amazon reviewers I selected this one and wasn't disappointed.<br />Mundle attempts to show the  personal side of the individuals as well as the intense struggle on each  boat and helicopter.  This is a spellbinding story which he did a good job  of relaying.  I learned about sailing but more importantly, I learned what  it felt like to confront your worst nightmare come true.<br />This is a  great subject correctly described by the author and as a bonus, the  pictures in the book are good also.  Off-coast sailing?  Not for me after  this book.	2000-05-11

An added plus to the book is his variety of clients from John Belushi to the Muppets.  I couldn't put the  book down and read it in two days as it was that enjoyable.<br />The book  overlays his departure from his firm and turning it over to the next  generation of managers.  It clearly was tough for him and he seems to touch  on unresolved issues without finalizing them.  Read the book and draw your  own conclusions on this point.	2000-05-11

I'm not sure Partnoy has the guts for the business and that permeates through the books.  There is a strong bias that the bankers purposely take advantage of customers.  Does  that happen?  Sure.  But is it rampant as presented?  Absolutely not.  But  it does sell books so a disgruntled employee goes for the  gold.<br />Derivatives are complex and many investors did not truly understand  what they were buying.  That doesn't mean all the sellers are criminals.  I'd take a pass on this unless you want to increase your knowledge on these  complex assets and read some mildly interesting stories.	2000-05-11

The studies are clinically written and as a reviewer already stated, it really doesn't address the second part of the  title, &quot;how to avoid them&quot;.  I didn't learn from the book but it  was mildly interesting.  I particularly like the Montgomery Ward story  where you have to almost laugh at the companies stupidity.  Read if you  like the subject and have the time but don't expect a  &quot;bestseller&quot;.	2000-05-11

I still don't know.	I'm an I-banker and former CPA.  I read this book and still can't tell who's right.  More than likely as with most arguments, the truth is somewhere in the middle.<br />Jett builds a great case of his bosses setting  him up but when someone works this hard at it, I become very suspicious.  He does have some very creditable points that his bosses knew or should  have known what his accounting practices were.  Employee of the year to  criminal?  Where was internal audit?<br />Basically, this book allows you to  hear one side of the story for you to draw your opinions from.  I'm not  sure what is correct but I enjoyed the read and see one more time the  &quot;ego filled&quot; life of Wall Streeters.	2000-05-11

This is a great movie that  was never made. I don't want to give away the plot, but the father receives  a call that will hook the reader to the book.

Therefore I felt it  was time to understand the blacklist.  As most readers, I was surprised by  the &quot;conservative view&quot; truth.  I consider myself liberal but I  can't see how anyone could support the belief that communism equals freedom  of speech after reading this review.<br />What will you learn?  The beginning  of Ronald Reagons's activism, exactly how influential the communist party  was in Hollywood unions, and the blind support given by so many celebrities  to this brutal regime.<br />This is not a fun read, but a in-depth analysis of  an important issue to the development of our country.  Frankly, I don't  recognize this country that would embrace communism as some Americans did  in the 30s to 50s.  For this reason, the book provided a valuable  intellectual journey in my discovery of American history and would  recommend it to others.	2000-05-01

With many short stories about different subjects, it provides great stopping points if you have to read it in many settings.  Many of the stories are rehashed and if you read Forbes and Fortune you will be familiar with much of the material.  Irrespective, it  is still humorous, educational and entertaining, particularly if you are  not well versed on the subjects.  Having read Ellison's book, a little of  Larry goes a long way.  The Yahoo story was particularly interesting as I  had not read much on them.  The &quot;old&quot; history of the valley was  also interesting to frame where we are now and this book gave a good review  of the incestous growth from those companies.  I think you will enjoy this  book.	2000-04-28

I casually know two people who dated her and was interested in her perspective.<br />Cybill has been on Hollywood's &quot;out&quot; list more than any other living  actress.  This book gives her time to have her side of the story told.  But  frankly, listening to her side of the story, you can envision the other  side and understand why she has had relationship problems in Hollywood.  I'm not sure Cybill quite gets it but thinks she does.<br />Irrespective, she  has had an interesting life and a story I enjoyed reading.  If you like sex  tell-alls, this is your book although she does hide some names showing at  least a shred of diplomacy.<br />She also touches on troubled relationships in  her family and how she has taken four hours of therapy for the last 10  years.<br />Probably the most fascinating part of the book is the  introspective review in the last chapter.  It's almost out of character  with the book but does show what a deep thinker she can be.<br />I recommend  the book for a quick read about Hollywood, sexual liberation or feminist  viewpoints.  A menage with two men?  Not your typical southern girl.	2000-04-17

While I looked forward to this book and am glad I read it, I cannot recommend it.  Al is an interesting funny guy but that doesn't come out in the book.  The book  reads clinically without the emotion of Al McGuire felt through the writer.  I did enjoy hearing of his early life but it was too long.  Same for  Belmont Abbey.  Along the way you do learn interesting facts like he had a  losing record when hired at Marquette.  But, generally, as much as I liked  the subject, the book did not live up.<br />PERSONAL MCGUIRE STORY.<br />I was at  the Memphis State game described on Page 229 where with 45 seconds left and  up by 5, an MSU player stepped in the foul lane losing the Tigers a one and  one and probably the game.  Yes, Al left the court with both hands raised.  Raised in what he later called the &quot;Irish salute&quot;, middle finger  extended. Al had incited the crowd, touched us with his enthusiasm.  When  he came later to call some Keith Lee games, he fondly remembered the game  and how he left the field.  This is the &quot;Al&quot; the country knew and  loved.	2000-04-11

As a University of Memphis booster involved in some of the details of his hiring, I looked forward to reading this book to see if the coach we hired was a facade or for real.  You can't read this book without getting fired  up.  Obviously a great salesman who is dealing on a higher plain than just  &quot;basketball coach&quot;.

His examples virtually always used anonymous people.  I am a bond I-banker so little in here really surprised me and in  many ways it became boring.  An avid stock investor with no finance  experience may find it titillating where I did not.<br />I read the book  hoping for interesting stories.  There were a few like the female who had  no problems using whatever tools were necessary. Otherwise, it was  relatively bland.  There are many other books on this subject more  interesting.	2000-02-22

Great, fast, informative and fun.<br />Dale Brown beats to a different drummer and this book let's you see the world from his perspective.  My respect for him goes up immensely.  But the highlight of the book is the  basketball stories.  My favorite subjects were 1.his relationship with John  Wooden, 2. recruiting top-notch players, 3. Shaq and how he met him, 4.  dirty recruiting, 5. why he hates the NCAA, 6. the role of media and fans  and 7. Bobby Knight and their feud.<br />Dale admits his faults and explains  his logic.  He never bent his principals and I respect him for that.  A 200  page, quick read and worth every minute.  Whether you like Dale or not,  read this book and you will have more respect for him and enjoy yourself  along the way.	2000-02-09

The author takes a view of the subject from many angles.  The  chapter dealing in the profit or loss of athletic departments is very  enlightening particularly as it deals with the lack of accounting standard  conformity.<br />In the last chapter the author recommends 10 steps to cure  the problems.  Frankly, I didn't find them compelling and generally not  workable.  This is a thought provoking read if you have interest in the  subject but should not be purchased for entertainment purposes as it reads  more like a business analysis.	2000-02-07

I reviewed the Amazon reviews and anticipated a quality read. Frankly, I was very disappointed.  I am a male but have no problem with the female prespective and interesting  character development.  This book fell woefully short.<br />I believe the  author does a good job of developing the primary character.  All other  characters were only briefly touched with generalizations and stereotypes.  The interaction of the main character with others was also very brief and  unfulfilling.  Her love interest is not fully developed and did not  emotionally attach the reader into &quot;feeling&quot; the emotion.  The  &quot;sex boss&quot; villian is also briefly sketched and not developed  enough to dislike.  Her husband and stepson are developed better but I did  not feel she drew a conclusion to the husband.  Also, the husband has a  major problem mentioned throughout the book but it really is not  substantial to the book storyline and could be left out completely.<br />There  is a surprise 40 pages from the end and it does draw the first substantial  emotion from the reader.  The final conclusion with the stepson is also  mildly interesting but does not create the emotional attachment I  desired.<br />All in all, I definitely wouldn't recommend the book.  I'm  interested how many reviews were positive and can only conclude that  females will better understand the feelings of despair by the writer.	2000-01-26

You will learn in-depth information about recruiting and why athletes may look at certain colleges.  There is a lot of sleaze in college recruiting and this exposes quite a bit.<br />The  book eventually became repetitive as he continued to build his case against  the shoe companies.  Yes, there is a problem but no alternative solution  was really suggested.  I'm glad I read it and would encourage college  basketball fans to read.<br />A friend of mine played D1 basketball and pro  overseas.  He toured America including Hawaii before he was 16 even though  he came from the worst ghetto in Memphis where he say 6 people killed and  was robbed twice himself.  Although he started as a Prop 48, he eventually  received his degree.  While I don't like the influence of shoe companies,  he is an example of a productive man that the shoe companies may have  helped.  It's not an issue with easy answers.	2000-01-18

I read this book in three quick reads and found it very entertaining.  The chapter about Mr. X is incredibly funny and almost unbelievable.  If anyone knows who he is, I'm dying to know, please email me.<br />Andy was clearly a  strange guy marching to a different drummer.  It's a fascinating life and  worth the read.  Zmuda and Kaufman were clearly funnier off screen than  on.<br />Previous interviewers were negative on Zmuda talking about himself  and this created some trepidation on my part.  That was not warranted as he  didn't overly talk about himself and frankly, his life is also interesting.  The final chapters dealing with death show Zmuda's personal growth and  maybe his final maturity to a real adult.<br />I encourage this book for  entertainment, particularly if you enjoy Satuday Night Live, Rodney  Dangerfield, Jim Carrey or Robin Williams.  These men were peers and  influences in Andy's life or he in their's.  If you get the chance to see  the two Andy Kaufman specials which run on Comedy Central, Comedy and  Wrestling, make a point to watch.  They serve as a great visual background  to this book.	2000-01-16

This book  was a great starting point and gave exceptional historical reference to  understand how our system got to where it is today.<br />This book reads like  a college text so don't buy this for entertaining reading unless you are  prepared to study this subject.  The historical review is exceptional.  I  have to admit that I did not fully read the substantial section on women  athletics although I did summary read.  There were debates and NCAA rules  passed in the 40s I was not aware of and am glad I discovered in this book.  It also shows a historical backdrop to why the south is so overzealous  about college sports.  Frankly, I'm glad I read this book and would  recommend it for anyone interested in the subject.  I would not recommend  it for light reading.  The unique experience of the writers gives you  respect in their ability to write this book and the opening by the athlete  who was paralyzed frames why this subject should be reviewed further.  As  cynicism is creeping into my love for the sports of my alma mater, this  book helped me understand the issues better.	1999-12-25

The business stories are exceptional.  Unfortunately, too much time was spent documenting his sailing/computer obsession.  I'm sure Lewis felt he needed to document that  side based upon his time on the boat.  That aside, the business stories and  history of Clark's accomplishments are exceptional.  As an investment  banker, no offense taken  by his dislike of financial people.  This book  allows the reader enough information to personally decide how he feels  about Internet valuations.

Unfortunately, the writer was  very jumpy and didn't consistently tell the story.

They clearly had  an opinion of the issue and assumed the readers would believe them without  documentable support just from pictures of families.  They may have a valid  point but they so poorly documented it, I struggled to finish the book and  immediately threw it away.  Arguments are presented as generalizations and  the repeated reference to the issue as a &quot;drug war&quot; and current  inmates as &quot;POWs&quot; wears thin.  The only potential valid point is  that mandatory sentencing for drugs does not allow the judges leniency.  Ok, but when your proof is jailed inmates who admit guilt but say the same  thing (&quot;I shouldn't be in jail this long for a nonviolent  crime&quot;), eventually it wears thin.<br />Please offer proof next time  such as an in depth look into a specific court case to prove our legal  system doesn't work.  I suspect if you do drugs or sell drugs you will like  this book and have one more complaint with &quot;big brother&quot;.  I  guess people shouldn't be accountable for their actions.	1999-11-25

While the publicity of his death hogs the  headlines, the highlight of this book is his travels in the Southwest and  the friendships he made.<br />Another masterpiece by Krakauer who is probably  better suited than any American writer to write this story.	1999-02-15
