She is naively condescending about her mother, failing to see her strength. When she graduates medical school, her idealism prompts her to help prisoners rather than join a prosperous medical practice.<br /><br />Pilar is the latest creation of Durango author Tekla Dennison Miller.<br /><br />Pilar is a departure for Miller, whose previous two books - The Warden Wore Pink and A Bowl of Cherries - were memoirs. The first recounted Miller's 20-year career in the prison service. The second was about her childhood.<br /><br />Miller draws on her corrections career for her first published novel.<br /><br />Part character study, part thriller, the novel attempts to explain how an intelligent, good-looking, \\"good\\" woman could fall for the \\"bad\\" prison inmate who murdered her friend.<br /><br />Pilar's attraction to Chad Wilbanks is a troubling parallel to her mother's attraction to her father.<br /><br />It's easy to criticize the daughter's relationship with the inmate. It's a harder pill to swallow when the reader realizes that the mother's relationship with the doctor father is equally poisonous. Miller succeeds in showing how a selfish, greedy man seemingly successful to outsiders suffocates his wife's soul. Meanwhile, an outcast outsider nourishes his daughter's insecurities.<br /><br />In Life Sentences, we get a look at the inside of a prison and an account of the phenomenon of women being attracted to murderous prison inmates.<br /><br />It's a legitimate and fascinating phenomenon. I remember the women who lined up to visit Death Row inmates in Florida during an 18-month period in which I was visiting an inmate there, conducting inevitably stifled romances that sometimes resulted in marriages to men whose wives could never hope to live with them.<br /><br />The success of Miller's novel lies in her ability to make Pilar a thoroughly likeable, successful woman whose reasons for loving a serial killer become understandable to the reader. Pilar Brookstone is no freak - she's a \\"normal\\" person whose love for a killer is somehow disturbingly easy to accept.<br /><br />In pulling this off, Miller triumphs.<br /><br />The novel is a fast-paced thriller populated by three-dimensional characters who stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.successful woman whose reasons for loving a serial killer become understandable to the reader.

Official corruption. Fraudulent land scales. A car bombing. Jurisdictional struggles. Hypnosis. A hung-over judge. Prosecutorial misconduct. A senile attorney.<br /><br />What might sound like the ingredients of an over-wrought novel are the facts of Durango author Thornton W. Price III's nonfiction true crime book, \\"Murder Unpunished,\\" published by The University of Arizona Press on July 1.<br /><br />The cast of characters includes a future U.S. Supreme Court justice (Sandra Day O'Connor), a future Democratic presidential candidate (Bruce Babbitt) and the man who pioneered the psychological autopsy (Dr. Otto Bendheim).<br /><br />But most of the players in this extraordinary peek at Arizona State Prison run amok came straight from Satan's casting call, even down to the unfortunate Waymond Small, possibly one of the nation's least likable murder victims.<br /><br />The time is the late 1970s. In less than two years, there have been 14 murders and dozens of assaults at Arizona State Prison. The Arizona Republic has cast a relentless eye on the mayhem. The political pressure to do something ratchets up. And finally the Aryan Brotherhood takes a bridge too far with the murder of Small on the eve of his testimony to the state legislature.<br /><br />Price, the author, was a young attorney. One of the inmates charged in connection with Small's death-a group collectively known as the Florence Eleven-ends up being Price's first murder case.<br /><br />Tempting though it must have been, Price wisely avoids much use of the first-person in this economically written account of five murder trials. When he does resort to it, it's justified by the insight it offers.<br /><br />My own first nonfiction true crime book, \\"Someone Has to Die Tonight,\\" is scheduled to be published as a Pinnacle mass market paperback in March. I know the challenge Price took on in combing through 16,000 pages of court records and conducting interviews with key players for his narrative.<br /><br />I also know how his involvement in the case probably made the task harder. I became a confidential informant in the case of a self-styled teen militia that I was documenting. Separating oneself from the story and keeping the narrative focused becomes more difficult when there's a personal connection.<br /><br />The Florence Eleven was the case for Price: The case that every cop, attorney or crime reporter knows about-the one you never forget. In spite of this, Price showed remarkable discipline in his writing, and it serves his readers well.<br /><br />My literary attorney, Bob Pimm, counseled me to make my book a train ride that readers wouldn't want to get off. The train needs to take off in the first chapter, he said, and the reader needs to want to say on all the way to the end.<br /><br />Price kept me on the train.<br /><br />\\"Murder Unpunished\\" has moments of writing that jumps out for its eloquence or economy. He describes one murder in two pithy sentences: \\"Even with a loaded gun to his head, the idiot wouldn't shut up. He'd dared him to shoot, so he did.\\"<br /><br />And here's how one of the large cast is introduced: \\"With a thin, six-foot-seven-inch frame, Jerry Joe `Stretch' Hillyer looked like he'd survived the rack.\\"<br /><br />And here, another: \\"Born in Scottsdale one week before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Tidwell's life began in as much ruin as the Pacific Fleet.\\"<br /><br />Price knows we need humor in a dark tale ridden with murder, rape and drug abuse, and he finds it (somehow it always seems to be there, even in the darkest crime, often because of the extraordinary stupidity of some criminals, whose choices in life seem determined to provide job security for police and prosecutors).<br /><br />\\"Did you see anything?\\" a tired investigator asks in one of 650 inmate interviews after Small's murder.<br /><br />\\"No.\\"<br /><br />\\"Would you tell us if you had seen anything?\\"<br /><br />And then there's Price's account of the state's attempts to hypnotize a witness, a chapter that may alone justify the book's $17.95 cover price.<br /><br />True crime is a tempting genre for the very reason that makes readers sometimes skeptical the writer could really know all he portrays. How could we know people's thoughts? How could we recapture dialog years after the fact?<br /><br />It's possible because of the uniquely thorough nature of investigative and court records, around which entire books can be built. It's not an easy task sifting thousands of pages for the specks of gold that add up to a compelling narrative. There are a lot of mediocre true crime books out there. Price's is not one of them.<br /><br />Here we find a writer unafraid to show a criminal's sheer enjoyment of violence. A writer who's resisted the temptation to include every fact or exchange he personally finds compelling, restraint that must sometimes have been painful.<br /><br />He knows court procedure and introduces us to terms such as the \\"slow-form guilty plea\\"-the trial of someone obviously guilty from the get-go.<br /><br />He shows us the Mau Maus, the Mexican Mafia, the Native Brotherhood and the Aryan Brotherhood out of control in Arizona's penal system and what was done to fix it. He gets the prison language of kites, fish and punks exactly right in a sometimes profane book that avoids overdosing on cussing and violence.<br /><br />He explains very well why prison crimes are so singularly hard to investigate.<br /><br />Down among the human dross, Price somehow emerges with none of the nastiness sticking to him or the reader. Better, he somehow makes us care.<br /><br />He gives fascinating insight into how the Aryan Brotherhood worked, like a business. And he offers some motivation without making excuses for his unattractive cast.<br /><br />The case comes as close to Durango as Chimney Rock, just off Highway 160.<br /><br />Despite a misprint in the spelling of Price's name on the cover (one of those palm to the forehead blunders that has probably cost some hapless copyeditor restful sleep) \\"Murder Unpunished\\" is otherwise flawlessly edited.<br /><br />This is entertaining, educational and compelling. I hope Price will find another case somewhere in his career worth writing about.witness, a chapter that may alone justify the book's $17.95 cover price. <br />True crime is a tempting genre for the very reason that makes readers sometimes skeptical the writer could really know all he portrays.

US	51038303	R1FYYY7B876XD6	0029215978	699846305	For the Common Defense: A Military History of the United States of America	Books	5	51	53	N	N	Excellent survey of U.S. military history	I wish more people, especially members of the media, would read this non political survey of U.S. military history from the early 1600s beginnings of English settlement to the collapse of the Soviet Union and Desert Storm, with extensive bibliographies. This is an excellent map for the beginning student of our military history, charting the territory. It can help us avoid taking too short-term a perspective on current events.<br /><br />Without this grounding it's easy to believe our current challenges are new. They're not. The U.S. has faced constantly changing threats throughout its history, even as the country itself has continuously changed. U.S. military strength has always fluctuated, expanding in times of threat & contracting in peace. We have gone to war ill-prepared, then triumphed after spectacular military build-up.<br /><br />We have been in a near constant state of preparing for war, fighting war or recovering from war. Public opinion has usually been divided, including going into the world wars. War has always had collateral damage. It has actually become considerably LESS unpleasant as technology & strategy have advanced. The Civil War, World War I & some battles of World War II were barbaric compared with anything we've seen recently.<br /><br />Our military has made vital contributions to our economy, technological advance, education and civil rights. Minorities, especially blacks & Native Americans, have played vital roles in our military throughout our history.<br /><br />The perspective given by Allan R. Millett & Peter Maslowski raises questions such as how could guerrilla warfare be described as a \\"new\\" challenge? Guerrilla warfare has been an issue since the Revolution. We ought have a good grasp on it by now.<br /><br />The book's weaknesses are mostly attributable to it being an ambitious survey. They include gaps in coverage (how did we get from post Vietnam demoralization to Cold War victory?) It's long on facts, short on explanation and analysis (WHY did the Soviets collapse? WHY did we succeed?) It's necessarily superficial & doesn't probe controversy deeply (there's scant attention to the U.S. relationships with Saudi Arabia or Israel).<br /><br />On the other hand, the book is very good on the relationship between the U.S. & the U.K. It's surprising how late (going into World War I) Britain was still regarded with wariness.<br /><br />The book is thought-provoking on the unattractiveness (similar to Russia) of the U.S. as an invasion prospect. It also puts into perspective the claim that the U.S. never invades other countries (we've been invading throughout our history).<br /><br />The book is quite good on the relationship between civilian authorities & the military, on the evolution of military management (professionalization is not a new concept) & on the rise of air power. It also touches on nonfiring Soldiers, an important issue excellently addressed in Lt. Col. Dave Grossman's \\"On Killing.\\"<br /><br />In the context provided by this book, it's abundantly clear talk of a \\"peace dividend\\" & even the \\"end of history\\" after the Soviet collapse was naive. More troubling, history suggests conscription probably isn't gone forever (though it'll take a bigger crisis than the one we face now to prompt a return). The book, though, is good at showing conscription isn't what it's made out to be & its role in nudging volunteerism.<br /><br />National Guardsmen & Reservists will find here that tensions with the Regular Army have always existed, that the National Guard & Reserve playing a significant role in conflict is nothing new, that Citizen Soldiers have a proud tradition & that there's always been room to raise the standard of the Guard & Reserve.<br /><br />As a Soldier, it's fun to see pieces of Army history we've already learned out of context fall into place & into perspective & to get a better grounding in, for example, who the people were whose names now live on in the names of Army posts.<br /><br />Millett & Maslowski's excellent survey is on the U.S. Army Chief of Staff's Professional Reading List (Sublist 1).Army Chief of Staff's Professional Reading List (Sublist 1).	2005-05-04

At the risk of being callous--since this book recounts a true story that brought death & pain to real people--the most astonishing thing about Carlton Smith's outstanding \\"Cold-Blooded\\" is that it turns out sometimes the consequences even of murder are just downright funny.<br />The last half of the book takes on the quality of the classic noir film \\"Blood Simple,\\" with a murder victim who just won't die & a couple of murderers caught up in a waking nightmare, trundling their would-be victim around in a wheelchair, preventing searches of the trunk of their car only as a last-second afterthought, surrounded by hundreds of witnesses, improvising their way through an appalling crime.<br />\\"Cold-Blooded\\" is very well done. The three key characters are Larry McNabney (murder victim), Elisa McNabney (grifter) & Sarah Dutra (grifter's apprentice). Smith gives life to all three for us. He takes a complicated series of crimes--those involving financial dealings at a law office could've been particularly distracting--& handles them brilliantly, not bogging the reader down or allowing the narrative to be distracted by some of the potentially fascinating but ultimately dead-end subplots.<br />This should be a movie. Cast correctly, with a good screenplay, it would be excellent.<br />Until you've read the book, you're maybe not going to understand how there could be humor in the story. Safe to say that all three main characters' stories resolved in exactly the ways that the three people had been living their lives. They made their choices, and they resulted in predictable outcomes. It's hard to feel too much sympathy for any of them.<br />I always grapple with Amazon's rating system when it comes to true crime, because there are the true classics of the genre (\\"In Cold Blood,\\" etc.) & then everything else & it seems so unfair to judge all on the same scale. However, I have no hesitation giving Smith's book five stars. It's an excellent piece of writing that takes voluminous research & parses it into an extraordinary, compelling story. Well done!o an extraordinary, compelling story. Well done!	2005-02-06

The truly startling aspect to the Eli Stutzman story is that justice doesn't appear to have been done & the cases in which he is implicated don't appear to have been resolved. One hopes that one effect of Gregg Olsen's compelling account will be to keep this lack of resolution in someone's mind somewhere in the hopes that justice will be done before Stutzman gets to die a free man.<br /><br />\\"Abandoned Prayers\\" is not for readers who will be offended by description of homosexuality. Homosexuality is part of the Eli Stutzman story & necessary to the narrative in order to explain who Stutzman is & what some of his motivation might have been. It's also clear from Olsen's narrative that Stutzman is an aberration within the gay community.<br /><br />Questions remain about some of the cases touched on in \\"Unanswered Prayers,\\" especially two cases in Colorado, & one hopes that those questions will be resolved.<br /><br />Eli Stutzman and, surprisingly, his son Danny are both well-drawn characters in the book. We don't know Danny intimately, because the author couldn't, because he died so young. But we nevertheless get a wrenching portrait of a stuttering, lost, needy boy denied the chance to reach his potential & denied the chance just to be a child.<br /><br />Whether Stutzman actually physically murdered Danny--& there is some ambiguity about this--isn't really the point, in a way. He murdered Danny's spirit with his appalling parenting & abuse. He is responsible for Danny's death regardless of whether he physically caused it or not. And his punishment for this crime was disgustingly inadequate, a real black eye for the justice system.<br /><br />Among other good, lesser characters are hapless Marine Denny Ruston, hapless Amish teen Sam Miller & hapless Stutzman roomie Glen Pritchett. They stand out as relatively solid people among a sea of names that reads like the wall in a graffited men's restroom stall.<br /><br />In this instance, it's not a problem that many of the lesser characters are little more than a name. That's all they were to Stutzman. It serves to emphasize to the reader the nature of Stutzman's lifestyle & his transitory, passing contact with dozens of hapless men.<br /><br />The reader gets the sense that this is one of the author's favorite cases, much as police often have a particular case that stays with them. One also gets the sense that it could be wide-open to a sequel if justice is ever served.<br /><br />Olsen shows rather than tells the appalling failure of everyone to help Danny.

It's thought-provoking & helpful for anyone in recovery.<br /><br />At heart, some may come to realize that they're confronting as much a living problem as an alcohol problem & that the Steps (11 of which do not mention booze) offer a better way of life.<br /><br />AA is not the only way to recover, but it has proven effective for millions around the world facing a problem with a high relapse rate & lousy prognosis. Anyone who's reached their wit's end with alcohol will find help in AA. The program has no religious requirement, & its members do not tell anyone what to believe. They only suggest a person be willing to believe in a power greater than themself, a god of their understanding. For all anyone cares, this could be a pet dog, as long as it's something to remove the notion that the person is at the center of the universe.<br /><br />AA has been successful for decades, it is the model for all other 12 Step programs & it is the foundation of much recovery. The program helps members who follow the 12 Steps to restore their self-worth through practicing integrity. It encourages members to let go of self-pity about perceived wrongs done them, accept responsibility for their own lives, acknowledge their pasts & (& this is key) move on. Above all, it encourages living in the present rather than in the past or the future ... thus increasing the odds that one will actually live.<br /><br />This book is one outstanding part of an arsenal available to alcoholics who want to see their disease go into remission. For anyone who finds the program not to their taste, a return to drinking is always an option.	2005-01-05

My understanding is the jury is still very much out on this, with possible new evidence I don't know much about since this is the only book I've read on the case. However, if Thomas was a prosecutor and I was on a jury I'd need some darned good defense work not to convict Patsy Ramsey.<br /><br />Whoever the killer was, Thomas gives a compelling account of how police, prosecutors, parents and the media conspired to grotesquely fail a 6-year-old girl whose humanity was sadly obscured even in her short beauty contestant life and certainly in her death.<br /><br />The parents' lack of cooperation is baffling. The district attorney's behavior is extraordinary. Thomas is remarkably restrained in his prose, especially considering his obvious passion for the case. The book is well-written and well-paced, moving right along.<br /><br />It remains a mystery to me why specific cases such as this one attract such a media feeding-frenzy yet others go unnoticed. Based on the types of victims the media fixates on, I hope a subtle racism and snobbery isn't at play. What do JonBenet Ramsey, Chandra Levy and Lacy Peterson all have in common?<br /><br />Thomas' case is far from clutching at straws. His evidence is powerful. Particulary striking are Burke Ramsey's voice on the 911 tape and Patsy Ramsey's authorship of the infamous ransom note.<br /><br />Why did the Ramseys point so many fingers at friends? Why did the Ramseys not jump up and down from the very beginning and practically sleep out with the Boulder police and demand their daughter's killer be found. Presumably for the same reason OJ didn't, right?<br /><br />I would like to have read a bit more description of Boulder, a stronger sense of place. Burke Ramsey also is not a character at all in the book, and he probably should have been. Other than that, this is a powerful indictment of a criminal justice system, a town and parents who did nothing to avenge the murder of a child.he murder of a child.	2005-01-03

There's a reason police usually look close to victims first: That's where the answer lies in more than 90 percent of cases. Turns out this is true even when someone keels over as an apparent victim of ramdomn tampering of over-the-counter drugs.<br /><br />Gregg Olsen's account of the deaths of Bruce Nickell and Sue Snow and the subsequent conviction of Stella Nickell is extremely thorough & painstaking. At times, there are too many characters, but the book settles down as it goes along and improves the further one gets into it. It's very difficult with true-crime writing to know how to handle the large number of peripheral characters who sometimes appear in cases. Leaving them out could leave the story incomplete. Combining them into composites is a step into fictionalization. Including them as they are can bog things down. Tricky.<br /><br />Particularly memorable are the characters of Stella and her daughter Cynthia, juror Laurel Holliday & the unfortunate Paul Webking, wrongly suspected of murder.<br /><br />The questions left by the case & the ambiguity are fascinating. A solid read for true-crime fans that offers a very, very complete account & leaves no doubt that Olsen is the expert on the case.	2004-12-20

But Ann Rule's \\"Heart Full of Lies\\" is one of her best since \\"The Stranger Beside Me,\\" which is saying a lot, considering \\"Stranger\\" is itself a (flawed) classic.<br />\\"Heart\\" starts slow and just builds & builds & builds until we realize Rule just has a great grip on who the main characters are & has developed them very well. We get a very good sense of both Chris Northon & his wife Liysa. There is also a surprising & satisfying lack of ambiguity at the end about what happened.<br />The portrait of Liysa is ultimately devastating & compelling. I'm still thinking about her a couple of days after finishing the book. When do dysfunctional people cross the line from being merely a strain on their friends to being dangerous? How many people fit the category of dysfuctional time bombs? And why is it that some are able to fix themselves before calamity happens & become decent human beings where others never do?<br />The portrait of Liysa is all the more compelling because I got the sense that it ran against what Rule expected to find & against her natural sympathies. She seems inclined to empathize with abused women--but an empathetic abused woman is not where Rule's research leads her.<br />I don't recall the word \\"sociopath\\" anywhere in the book. But it does appear in reviews here. I suppose that is what Liysa is--a female sociopath (which seems to be rarer than male). If that's the case, then she's best locked up for the rest of her life.<br />\\"Heart\\" has well-developed characters, a decent sense of place & good reasons for being written. This is not (unlike much true crime) mere rubbernecking. This is a thought-provoking contribution to the genre.<br />Ann Rule has been doing this for a long time, & she is a true crime standard-bearer.	2004-12-09

I like this perspective, especially as one of the authors is one of the investigators. In fact, until it finally dawned on me that one of the authors worked the case, I was wondering how the book had so much detail.<br /><br />A great strength of the book is that Timothy Carney resisted the temptation to glorify himself or wander off into some sort of ego trip. In this respect, he is more successful than the much more famous Vincent Bugliosi. Bugliosi's books are very, very good, but his ego gets terribly irritating at times, and that doesn't happen here. \\"Final Affair\\" is not comparable with Bugliosi in other respects, but it's still very good in its own way.<br /><br />The book is restrained, almost understated at times. Carney is well developed as a character, which he should be under the circumstances. Both his flaws & his strengths are shown. The book is well paced. It is a solid, quick read. A particularly interesting aspect is Richard Overton's arrogance.<br /><br />Solid true crime that succeeds in being different from the standard fare because of the authors' unusual perspective and the portion of the story that is told. It might make a good movie.<br /><br />A deployed Soldier, I got to read this book for free thanks to people's donations of free books for Soldiers, a great program.	2004-09-12

The plot is overly complicated in that because he gets more ambitious in this book & tries to develop a more complex plot, there's a lot that is unsatisfactorily developed. It's irritating & abrupt sometimes to jump from one story line to another so much.<br /><br />Adam Chapel is well drawn. In what seems to be a Reich trait, other characters are not, especially Sarah Churchill, who just never resolves & comes into focus as a person for me.<br /><br />Reich's up-to-the-minute plots & settings are great, playing off current events.<br /><br />But, while this book is mildly entertaining, I found it really sort of an annoying read with its stops & starts & underdeveloped characters whose names confused me because I didn't know enough about them to keep them separate. Start with Reich's other books first.	2004-09-12
US	51038303	R26K034I4K5DTY	0440234697	666439399	The First Billion	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Another entertaining thriller from Christopher Reich	Having thoroughly enjoyed \\"Numbered Account,\\" I was ambivalent about reading another book from the same author because I doubted he would maintain the standard. However, I was thoroughly entertained by \\"The First Billion\\" & in some ways thought it superior to \\"Numbered Account.\\"<br /><br />If a tad more formulaic, \\"Billion\\" is smoother, more polished, with fewer rough edges than \\"Account.\\" The story is indeed carefully plotted, & I liked the side plot that some readers here do not. I enjoyed the false start aspect of it.<br /><br />Both Jett Gavallan & Grafton Byrnes are decent characters, & Konstantin Kirov is a decent villain with some complexity. Gavallan's ex is less well developed but still an OK character.<br /><br />The background of a Russian IPO is a great choice. Reich explains the financial world he uses as a setting very well. The reader does not feel patronized & understands what is going on.<br /><br />Another book I got to read for free because I am a deployed Soldier. If your church or community group collects paperbacks for this cause, donate some--it's a very worthwhile scheme.	2004-08-29
US	51038303	RPAA4VTVET5D7	031299544X	199096104	Innocence Lost	Books	4	9	13	N	N	Above average true crime	\\"Innocence Lost\\" offers a decent portrait of both the victim & the killer.<br /><br />The book has the increasingly familiar theme of widespread knowledge about a crime in the community both before & after it happened & apparent apathy towards it (another example of this was examined in the movie \\"River's Edge.\\")<br /><br />The killer is probably a sociopath. I just don't understand why people go through these hand-wringing searches for motives & pondering about how someone could do such a thing: There are people who are sociopaths. They lack empathy with other people. To them, killing is nothing more than stepping on a cockroach. It's that simple.<br /><br />The blame attributed to the police by some readers of this book is wholly inappropriate. The fault lies with the killer & with no one else.<br /><br />The tangental involvement of Cynthia Fedrick is very well done by the author, & she is a well drawn character.<br /><br />I got to read this book for free as a deployed Soldier; this is a great program that benefits those it is intended for & is much appreciated.	2004-08-28
US	51038303	R2N6MIXFV9SOJF	0425190730	431507905	Twelve Mile Limit (A Doc Ford Novel)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Entertaining thriller based on a true story	When I worked for The News-Press in Fort Myers, Fla., I was one of the reporters who covered the disappearance of three SCUBA divers & the rescue of a fourth from a tower miles out at sea--the story on which Randy Wayne White based this novel. So I know how faithful White is in this book to the original story.<br /><br />White made a great choice by being very faithful to the facts of the story while at the same time completely changing the characters involved. That was a respectful, sensitive way to approach this fictionalization--and it probably served him well as a writer.<br /><br />\\"Twelve Mile Limit\\" suffers from a problem I've found in other books set in real places. To my mind, White relies too much on names of places & institutions to convey a sense of place & doesn't do enough actual description. When he does describe, he's good at it--especially when it's something that's clearly a personal passion, such as the Gulf of Mexico. The scene where Doc Ford gets into the water in the middle of the night rings very true, for example. And that's because it is--White tells us at the end of the book that he did the same as part of his research.<br /><br />The only other book I've read in the series is the first, \\"Sanibel Flats,\\" which had a wonderful description of U.S. Highway 41 but (I felt at the time) little else to make it really stand out. \\"Twelve Mile Limit\\" is a great improvement & makes me interested in reading more in the series, especially as some reviewers here say it's not one of the strongest entries.<br /><br />There are some lost opportunities here, especially more development of the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" idea, which could have used probably a couple more pages of development in total that would have made it really good.<br /><br />White's personal story is inspiring. As I recall it, he once worked in Southwest Florida stringing telephone lines or some such, then did four years at The News-Press, then wisely left when daily newspapering had helped his writing & ear & eye & before it killed his creativity. Over a period of about 15 years, he turned himself into a nationally known outdoors writer & author. It's a great story.<br /><br />I like White's inclusion of the (real) human trafficking issue in the novel. Also, this is true to the actual events in that it was one of the theories about what happened.<br /><br />Many of White's Florida settings have recently been trashed by Hurricane Charley. I hope Southwest Floridians recover quickly. Knowing the spirit of the region & remembering the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew on the opposite coast, they will.<br /><br />Lastly, I got to read this book as a result of the donation of free books for deployed Soldiers. If you ever get the opportunity to donate books to this cause, it's a great program that actually benefits Soldiers & is greatly appreciated. I have not paid for a book since I deployed & never lack for new material to read.fore it killed his creativity.

He is well-drawn, fleshed out, complex and likable.<br /><br />I'm a little wary of reading Truscott's other books because reviews suggest they're not as good & I really hate to spoil this.<br /><br />I do not see the book as critical of West Point. The setting--especially in this case--rises above the people who happen to populate it for a short part of its history. Truscott doesn't want us to like some of his characters, but I don't think he has anything against West Point. In fact, I felt the book wanted to see the institution rise above & outlast some of its less attractive denizens.<br /><br />It may SEEM critical of the school to people unfamiliar with the type of discipline exercised there.<br /><br />To me, the profanity merely seems realistic & in a way amusing, since it is so clearly an affectation on the part of the characters who use it. They strive to be profane, & that is realistic of their ages, of the phases they're going through. The reader knows they will grow up & be exactly the kind of people who don't use that language, & that's funny, in a dry way.<br /><br />Nope, this was outstandingly entertaining. I should note that I came by it as a result of free books available to deployed  Soldiers. That's a great program that benefits troops. If you get a chance to send free books, do it! And many thanks to everyone who has.	2004-08-26
US	51038303	R3UL054ZXJXQH4	0393033813	794458901	Among the Thugs	Books	4	6	11	N	N	Compelling account of soccer hooliganism	Bill Buford's rejection of or distancing from violence in the latter part of this fine piece of journalism--a safari into the world of British soccer hooligans--is unconvincing. \\"Among The Thugs\\" is weakened by Buford's unwillingness to face his attraction to violence. He gets sort of halfway there & it's as though he's just unwilling to go further & frantically backpedals. That he joins in does not come as a surprise, & it's to Buford's credit that he's at least willing to acknowledge it.<br />At the same time that Buford seems unwilling to fully explore his attraction, it is a definite shortcoming of the book that he doesn't show that much concern for the random victims, who are not humanized. It would have been sobering--& very worthwhile--to have found a victim & painted a strong portrait in the same way he paints strong portraits of the thugs. It would have been a good balance.<br /><br />The book is sometimes unexpectedly anti British. It's a complex society. Buford sometimes paints it with an overly broad negative brush (I write this as a Brit by birth).<br />Buford inserts his (drinking--is this an excuse?) self into his reportage but then is unwilling to fully explore what he finds.<br />Buford also strives too hard to explain violence. This may be a red herring--maybe it defies rational explanation.<br />\\"Among The Thugs\\" is an important contribution to the topic, alongside others as diverse as \\"On Killing,\\" \\"Fight Club,\\" \\"In Cold Blood,\\" \\"Clockwork Orange\\" & \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners,\\" all of which shed light in different ways on different aspects of the same thing (in fact, they add up to a curriculum on violence). At its deepest level, it comes down to questions about why we are ever good & why we are ever evil & the nature of the struggle between the two. Also, the struggle between civilization & barbarism or between order & chaos.<br />I'm not at all sure that social issues are an explanation (or an excuse?) for what Buford documents here. Plenty of other places in the world have logarithmically worse social problems that don't result in similar behavior (but, then again, maybe the crowd behavior in Mogadishu is just further out on the same spectrum? See \\"Blackhawk Down.\\")<br />As a journalist, I have no problem beliving Buford attained the access he said he did. It's an art, but there's no doubt it can be done.<br />Buford's description of a National Front disco is one of the highlights of the book unmentioned by other reviewers. Its got a dark humor to it, too. Surprisingly, I laughed aloud several times during the book, to Buford's credit.<br />Well-written, excellent reporting, important topic, significant contribution to subject. A worthwhile read.<br />Do not read this if you find violence & anti-social behavior offensive subjects or if you are offended by graphic descriptions of same.

It gets dinged one star because the sense of place is weak. Goddard drops real place names but fails to describe them in a way that would bring them to life for someone who hasn't been there.<br /><br />One reviewer said this isn't Goddard's best. If that's the case, then I'm in for a treat, because it's my first &amp; I enjoyed it enough to want to read more Goddard. The plot is compelling &amp;, delightfully, intelligent. Some of the spiritual &amp; ethical questions raised by the book are fairly thought-provoking. Yet it's also a page-turning thriller. Quite an achievement.<br /><br />I was also impressed with the characters, who are well developed, especially the protagonist. Well worth the read.	2004-04-23

In spite of that, it's worth the read. This is a book with great characters (Shadow, Wednesday, Laura), great places (especially the roadside attractions) and a surprising sense of humor that saw me laugh out loud several times. I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2004-04-23

The two stars rating is solely directed at people interested in the profession of journalism, for whom this car wreck deserves a scan, if not being dwelt upon. That's because journalism professionals ought be familiar with the details of this case as a cautionary tale &amp; to avoid a repeat. For anyone else, I would probably give this one star. It isn't the worst book I've ever read (or, in this case, listened to) but it ain't got a lot to recommend it, either. I'd probably be agitated if I paid for it, but I borrowed the CD set from my Managing Editor, who received it as a donation, so no money wasted. I'd also be agitated if I'd invested much time, but I had to make a couple of seven hour drives anyway.<br /><br />It was interesting hearing this on CD. Hard to believe it's abridged, as long as it is. It's read by Blair &amp; hearing his voice somehow adds to the experience. He sounds well-educated, arrogant, intellectually lazy ... something really started to wear on me by about the seventh CD.<br /><br />Writing with the perspective of a recovering alcoholic myself, I believe one of the basic problems is Blair had not advanced very far along the mental road of recovery when he wrote this. He may be physically sober, but his absolute refusal to accept responsibility for just about anything, or to express remorse, or to exercise much insight suggests he has considerable work still to do. I hope for his sake he gets to look back in a few years &amp; be embarrassed he published this.<br /><br />Blair lists other people's alleged wrongdoings in an apparent effort to justify or minimize his own or at least deflect attention to them. He uses alleged hardships in his life as apparent excuses. We all have hardships and many people overcome ones far worse than those Blair alleges without turning into ungrateful pathological liars.<br /><br />I'm white, so I understand that I lack qualification to fully grasp racism &amp; the black experience in America. However, it seems to me an extreme stretch to somehow imply, as Blair does, that in being a student at the University of Maryland and then getting an internship followed by a job at The New York Times, that somehow he was a victim of racism. We should all be so lucky. Hundreds, probably thousands, of people of all racial backgrounds would pay dearly just for a chance at the opportunities Blair not only squandered but actually repaid by undermining both the university program he attended &amp; his employer.<br /><br />In Blair's world, he is at the center of the NYT, at the center of the paper's staff, at the center of his circle of friends. The world revolves around him &amp; his long-suffering girlfriend, about whom we hear way too much. He is terribly impressed with himself. He is impressed with his coverage of the sniper shootings, much of which he describes as limited to watching press conferences on TV &amp; attending press conferences. He somehow seems to imply that he identifies with Malvo, that Malvo isn't such a bad guy for shooting a bunch of people in cold blood, that Malvo (like Blair) is perhaps misunderstood. Spare me.<br /><br />The book is packed with trivia, name dropping and gossiup that could only possibly interest a small cadre at the NYT but which Blair seems to feel will be of compelling interest to the world.<br /><br />Some of Blair's account of his career might interest some people unfamiliar with the journey taken by newspaper reporters, but -- again -- it's seriously undermined by Blair's failure to convince that he's changed &amp; isn't still lying. Also, frankly, I don't care about all of the digressions in this book, I care about what Blair did in violating journalistic ethics. That's the only justification for this book to exist &amp; Blair does a very poor job addressing it.<br /><br />If true, Blair's criticisms of the NYT (specifically, its toe-touch/no touch datelines &amp; failure to credit stringers) are liberties with professional ethics. But theproblem is that given Blair's history &amp; given the traversty that is this book, we have no way of knowing whether to give these claims much credibility. When I was actively drinking, I believed pretty much everyone drank as I did. Perhaps when actively lying, Blair believed everyone lied as he did. The problem is one needs time &amp; space before deconstructing these self-delusions &amp; Blair appears to have taken barely any before rushing out this awful book.<br /><br />I am being exceedingly generous with stars. Do not waste your time if you are not a professional journalist or keenly interested in the media. Then, try to avoid paying for this &amp; use it as a case study in what to avoid.lair's history &amp; given the traversty that is this book, we have no way of knowing whether to give these claims much credibility.

If you haven't read any Krakauer before, &quot;Into the Wild&quot; is a good start, a shorter piece to whet the appetite.<br /><br />A disclaimer: I know some Mormons. I have been aware of the religion since the late 1980s, when I worked one summer alongside a tiler who was a Mormon and loaned me reading material. I completed Basic Combat Training with a Mormon. There is a highly respected Mormon ranching family in our county who set an example to aspire to in terms of human conduct. Bottom line, every Mormon I have ever met I have respected. Having said that, &quot;Under the Banner ...&quot; presents a disturbing picture of the religion in general and fundamentalism in particular.<br /><br />There is much to like in this compelling non-fiction book. It seems Krakauer is steadily marching through different genres (the outdoors, youth psychology, true crime) and demonstrating a mastery of each. His writing often reminds me of John McPhee, and I like it as well, which is saying a lot.<br /><br />The book is true crime, fascinating history and a thought-provoking discussion of fundamentalism. The book is strong both in its main narrative and in its digressions, such as the true story behind the Elizabeth Smart case, which for some reason seems to have been neglected by the media, who have been far more focused on the crime than on the religious issues at its roots.<br /><br />The book does raise disturbing questions about the LDS church, but it's mainly focused on fundamentalism, and since the mainstream church has gone to great lengths to separate itself from the fundamentalists, it seems a little strange that some adherents find this book so threatening. It is no doubt challenging, but that ought to be an important part of any faith, being challenged and finding it true or false. Blind faith seems undesirable and the main problem documented in this book.<br /><br />The most disturbing experience I ever have reading these reviews in this wonderful forum that amazon.com created is when people seem to hysterically condemn books or music because it challenges them. It ought to be possible, it seems to me, to separate the point of view of a book from the craft of the book. In other words, it seems to me it would be a sign of maturity to be able to say, &quot;I don't agree with a word this book says, but it is brilliantly done&quot; or &quot;I find this book's subject matter offensive, but it is brilliantly written.&quot; There is less of this approach than one might like.<br /><br />Personally, I want to be challenged. I want to be offended. I want to be made to think. I want my beliefs questioned. I want my opinions criticized. I want my paradigms held up to scrutiny. That is why I read.<br /><br />Regardless of how unpleasant an experience it might be for some people, this is a brilliant book and well worth reading. It builds beautifully, it is wonderfully executed, and it is just an outstanding piece of craftsmanship. I was not quite the same when I finished it, and my view of both fundamentalism and the LDS church was changed by it. That does not mean I hold individual Mormons I know in any less respect, and surely the manner in which religious followers live says the most about their religion. This book documents the appalling behavior of some -- a problem common to all religions, whether displayed by Christian inquisitors/crusaders or Muslim terrorists or the Mormon Lafferty brothers.

It's a solid summary of the president's faith.<br /><br />The book has a realistic, middle of the road viewpoint, neither hero-worshipping nor denigrating the president. Mansfield doesn't balk at showing Bush led far from a spotless life -- and he doesn't rub his nose in it, either. For a quick-hit, relatively superficial book, this is surprisingly good. Better than I expected. This is not a homily to Bush and yet at the same time it managed to erase some of my recent doubts about the president.<br /><br />What I've liked about Bush since the first presidential campaign is precisely that he's a flawed human that I can relate to. He doesn't speak well (Mansfield suggests, interestingly, that he might be dyslexic). He's made mistakes. He is probably an alcoholic. He was not a picture of success at age 40. Yet he's turned all of this around and was president less than two decades after that midlife low point. Clearly part of the turnaround is confronting his alcoholism and finding a higher power. What Bush pulled off -- and the faith behind it -- is inspiring. DESPITE his family and wealth, he's a reminder that anyone can be president.<br /><br />The president's faith is not a scarey thing: One gets the impression of a flawed real person who probably has the same doubts many do even as he pursues a humble walk. It seems a deeply personal faith, not one he's trying to bash people over the head with. And Bush seems very far from trying to play the saint. It doesn't seem a scarey politicized facist sort of faith at all. It's not POLITICAL faith -- it's PERSONAL faith.<br /><br />Overall, this is inspiring and reassuring. And it's nice to have the details of the president's Methodism and his daily reading of Chambers.<br /><br />What's so fascinating in 2004 is the perspective that the president may very well be a bold leader who is facing a storm of criticism and passion precisely because he's a strong leader who does not slavishly turn with each subtlety of the opinion polls in a desperate effort to be all things to all people. He clearly doesn't care to please every critic.<br /><br />I suspect history will judge Bush more kindly than contemporaries, unlike say Clinton, who was clearly better liked by his contemporaries than he will be (or is already) by historians.with each subtlety of the opinion polls in a desperate effort to be all things to all people.

It didn't feel that way to me when I read it, though obviously it infuriated a lot of other reviewers. Some will find the book offensively profane, unpleasant and uncomfortable. I didn't. To me, it was an economically written page-turner, and I hope we hear more from the author.<br /><br />I should disclose that I am a soldier (Guardsman) with strong loyalty to the Army and huge respect for Marines, and I still did not find the book offensive. It just seemed honest.	2004-03-22

Last time I checked, there were eight -- at least it's double digits now.<br /><br />It perplexes me because this book has saved literally millions of lives. For anyone struggling with alcoholism, this is the way to get sober. The principles of the program can -- and have been -- applied to just about any addiction. This program is the foundation of Cocaine Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and every other 12 step program. This is where it all started.<br /><br />My pastor mentioned in church just today how the sprituality of people who've been in 12 step programs is sometimes especially striking. That's true. It's because if a person follows the 12 steps, they will find it a life-changing experience. They will not be exactly the same person they were when they started. For more on this, see a passage in the book known in the program that took its name from the book's title as &quot;the promises.&quot;<br /><br />If you read this book, also read the accompanying 12 Steps and 12 Traditions volume. The two go together -- though if you read only one read this one.<br /><br />The book is especially helpful in dealing with the issue of a higher power.<br /><br />The book goes way beyond what someone will find in a typical AA meeting. A person who is attempting sobriety needs this book, a sponsor and the meetings.<br /><br />This is, statistically, the best shot there is at sobriety. This book and the program it spawned are an extraordinary gift for those who choose to accept them.<br /><br />The newcomer might find the book somewhat dated. Stick with it. It's worth it. And, as time goes by, it will become clearer and clearer.	2004-03-22
US	51038303	R1GR5YSHCAW0MY	0380731851	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A masterpiece of its genre	The genre is dark, gritty thrillers and Dennis Lehane's &quot;Mystic River&quot; is one of the best.<br /><br />I'm getting really tired of reviews that whine about profanity, darkness and weaknesses of character in fictional characters (or real ones, for that matter). I don't read (unless I'm reading fantasy) to get some glossed-over view of the world. I read to learn about other people's truths, the way other people see reality, and so enhance my own ... and reality is often profane, dark and marked by people with serious character defects.<br /><br />You'll get all of that in this book, and it's so well done. I admire Lehane's ability to make flawed people likeable (Jimmy Marcus). And also his ability to make me feel guilty about not liking (in the least little bit) the character of Dave Boyle. I felt like I should feel some empathy for Boyle because of what happened to him, but he was just so annoyingly weak and self-pitying and pathetic. What ends up happening to him is partly his own fault. It's inevitable he'll come to a bad (if surprising) end. It's a credit to Lehane's masterful sense of character that Boyle annoyed me so much ... and it's a credit to Lehane that he made Boyle such an annoying character, not a politically correct move.<br /><br />This is a suspenseful thriller, yet Lehane also manages to pull off a morality tale with the ending, and thereby to elevate the book and the genre.<br /><br />I love the deliberate, disciplined pacing of the book. Because Lehane is so disciplined, he gives himself plenty of time to give us a great sense of place and develop the characters. He elevates what could be a pulp novel to literature.<br /><br />The book is notable for its sense of character and of place. The dialog is very good. And there's nothing cardboard about it--it has a depth that leaves me with a lingering sense of the neighborhood and Jimmy Marcus and his store long after I put the book down.<br /><br />I read this in a couple of sittings knowing nothing of any upcoming movie. Now I want to see the movie because I hear it's also outstanding. Read this book--it's well worth the time.movie. Now I want to see the movie because I hear it's also outstanding.

Then why read? And if you fit this category, don't bother with \\"Buffalo Soldiers.\\" If you don't, keep reading ...<br /> I didn't read \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" for an accurate depiction of the Army, & I didn't get one. The Army is merely the novel's setting, as it was for \\"Catch-22,\\" which portrayed it no more accurately. These books are FICTION. That said, I read this in one sitting. Indeed, it cost me sleep on a recent transatlantic flight, because I didn't put it down, it moves with such a wonderful frenetic pace, which I was loath to interrupt.<br /> I was initially disheartened to realize the book is in the second person. It's a credit to Robert O'Connor that he pulls this off beautifully. I'm certain this device can't often be used & work: O'Connor uses it masterfully. If I heard he had written a second book using the same technique, I would buy it sight unseen.<br /> The book is profane. It's not for the squeamish or easily offended. It doesn't paint a positive picture of its setting or, more or less, any of its characters (though I was pulling mightily for SPC Elwood by the end). And it's a helluva read. I wish O'Connor would get some more published.	2003-10-26

Lit by a spark but rooted in the region's worst drought on record, the summer of 2002's Missionary Ridge Fire transformed Southwest Colorado, burning 57 homes and 70,085 acres, leaving a bitter legacy of debris flows and showcasing La Plata County's greatest strength--community. &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; documents the region's biggest fire in words, maps and dozens of color photographs by the staff of The Durango Herald. The book goes beyond the fire to look at its roots in the drought. The effects of catastrophic wildfires don't end when the flames are out and the book documents the floods and debris flows that follow a large scale fire. It looks at recovery efforts, and it discusses prevention. ... The 117 page volume uses text, 142 photographs (by Jerry McBride, Nancy Richmond and Dustin Bradford) and several maps (by Keith Alewine) to tell the story of the 39-day blaze. The book is in its second printing: The first printing sold out. ... No question I'm biased, but this is a thorough account of a Western wildfire that contributes to general knowledge of the crisis facing our forests and the debate about how to fix it.	2003-09-09

Lured by good reviews from credible sources, evocative cover art (on the British edition, not the U.S. one), the book's award and the writer's reputation, I dived in for an entertaining escape &amp; emerged impatient &amp; disappointed. What saves the book are some good scenes, some decent description of place &amp; some well-drawn characters. But for me the experience was more like reading a series of creative writing vignettes than a novel. The novel lacks a center, a heart. There is a confusion of characters who lack much more characterization than names &amp; therefore are hard to separate. One character (Molly) changes abruptly from one personality earlier in the novel to another later on to the degree that it was difficult for me to see her as the same person (though I liked Molly No. 2). I found the plot confusing, hard to follow &amp; too sketchy. I didn't know nearly enough about many of the people who turned out to be central characters in the plot's resolution. I specifically did NOT find (as The London Times promised) &quot;lyrical descriptions of an almost vanished West&quot; but rather a fairly average sense of place. On the other hand, Milo &amp; bisexual Betty are interesting characters &amp; the book does have a certain feel to it, so I'm thoroughly ambivalent. Given there's enough reading for several lifetimes out there, I'd recommend choosing something else.	2003-09-05

To read the Editorial Reviews above (especially the \\"Publishers Weekly\\" one) is to learn too much about the novel before reading it. One of the merits of this novel is the surprises as the story unfolds. Another is the atmosphere, an unsettling creepy quality. This is not a book that made me comfortable -- especially the sexual issues -- but that's the point, and it's a book that becomes more compelling the more one reads -- especially as the mystery surrounding Roehm unfolds. A great strength of the book is the characters, who are very well drawn. There is some awfully good fiction coming out of Britain at present (see also Pat Barker's excellent \\"Border Crossing,\\" for example) and this is another example.	2003-09-04

I bought the book (individual cartoons also can be found in \\"The Army Times\\") at clothing & sales at Ft.

Recruiting, the haircut, vaccinations, jargon, fire guard, drill & ceremony, buffers, NBC, weapons ranges, low crawls, details & trips to the PX -- it's all here as experienced by Murphy, whose saving grace is that despite a little naivity & a dose of healthy skepticism he wants to be a gung ho, squared-away soldier. Baker's talent lies in the humor he finds in widely shared experiences, the positive tone he keeps and his cartooning skills as demonstrated in his creative use of perspectives, frames and shading. \\"Pvt. Murphy's Law\\" is right on target as only an insider could be. It will be enjoyed by anyone with Army connections.

The book is superior to &quot;American Terrorist&quot; (Lou Michel &amp; Dan Herbeck) in that it portrays McVeigh even-handedly where &quot;Terrorist&quot; gets too close to McVeigh &amp; is at times overly sympathetic towards him. &quot;Apocalypse&quot; is refreshing in resisting the temptation to get drawn into silly conspiracy theories. The book's greatest weakness is an unnecessarily negative, broad-brushed, ill-informed portrayal of the U.S. Army &amp; soldiers. It is clear that Hamm lacks knowledge about the Army. As a soldier, I found his portrayal inaccurate, verging on offensive. If the characterization of the Army had been more accurate, I would have given the book more stars.

This is an excellent, quick read. Jarrod Wall is very well portrayed. His suggested motivation for the murder is very interesting and quite convincing. However, Wall has all the classic traits of a sociopath & I came away from the book feeling that was equally important in his crime as the suggested motive. Many, many boys have experienced something along the lines of the trauma Jarrod went through without resorting to murder. My impression of Wall from the book made me glad he remains in prison. On the other hand, the author's portrayal of Erick Esch was also good, and I left convinced that he should not be in prison & deserved a second chance. Overall, this was a good, solid read & well worth the money & time for true crime fans.	2003-02-28

It's an extraordinary achievement, a haunting, understated, detailed, thorough, outstanding piece of journalism accomplished with remarkable speed, with the added interest of Lawrence Schiller's appearance (Schiller, of course, goes on from helping with \\"Song\\" to his own outstanding career, e.g. \\"Perfect Town ...\\") What remains with me the most a couple of years after reading \\"Song\\" is the atmosphere surrounding Gilmore's execution, the level of detail throughout & the sense of place. Includes a helpful afterword on Mailer's techniques. Gilmore, incidentally, was a sociopath, regardless of whatever sympathy he or Mailer might engender. It's symptomatic of sociopaths that they're often likeable (though I don't find Gilmore so), that's part of the deal, the chameleon nature. Gilmore wasn't destroyed by drugs or a generally good guy who had bad moments, he was a sociopath. Mailer's portrayal of the victims is weak, but the victim (for literary purposes) almost always isn't as interesting as the killer .... A must-read for true crime fans.	2001-12-29

It's a remarkably compelling &amp; well-told story &amp; it gets better as it goes along. One theme is the failure of the court system to respond to the warnings &amp; pleas of Manzie's own parents before the murder. The scene where a prosecutor attacks Manzie's mother in court is genuinely enraging--it's an incredible moment that demonstrates how successfully the author pulls the reader into the story. It made me fervently wish the prosecutor lost his job. The real achievement of this book is getting the reader to care about all sides of the case. Brian J. Karem shows the pain &amp; frustrations of both Werner's parents &amp; Manzie's parents excellently, shows the consequences for both sides, the remarkable similarity between their situations. He shows the families' period of feuding in such a way that you don't judge them for hating each other, you empathize for both sides. And Karem goes above &amp; beyond by presenting the pedophile's point of view in spite of its inherent odiousness. He shows who the pedophile is &amp; lets you decide for yourself what to think (it's not a difficult decision). This was a complex case &amp; Karem presents it very clearly, very economically &amp; compellingly in a way that surely even those involved would find strikingly empathetic. The only people who emerge with dignity in this are Ed &amp; Valerie Werner &amp; Nick &amp; Dolores Manzie. The justice system was at its indifferent worst from start to finish. Karem also manages to deal with thoroughly distasteful subjects sensitively. Excellent.	2001-12-18

There are probably people who would be an excellent example of someone given a second chance turning their life around and becoming a positive member of society: Kenneth Allen McDuff was not that person.

Strengths of the book, which is well above-average true crime but no &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; or &quot;The Executioner's Song,&quot; include the portrayal of McDuff's parents, that it documents sources &amp; includes an index, &amp; some well-chosen quotes from other sources, especially one about sociopathy: &quot;Antisocial personality disorder is the current name for what in the past has been known as sociopathy, psychopathy, moral insanity, or in pre-psychiatric days, evil.&quot; Why do publishers continue to undermine the genre with tabloid tactics like, &quot;With 8 pages of harrowing photographs&quot; when, in fact, there isn't a photo in the book that could be described as even mildly disturbing?

I was born &amp; raised in Britain, but I live &amp; write in the United States ... &amp; we're two nations divided by a common language. I'm writing about an autopsy &amp; I describe it as the deceased's &quot;last and best medical.&quot; What the heck is that, my wife asks? Using my &quot;Webster's New World Dictionary,&quot; I determine that, indeed &quot;medical&quot; does not mean &quot;physical&quot; in the U.S. So now I'm wondering if I imagined the idea that anywhere people say someone &quot;passed her medical with flying colors&quot; or whatever. So I turn to my &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Current English,&quot; where I learn that &quot;medical&quot; IS colloquially acceptable in Britain for what in the U.S. we'd call a &quot;physical.&quot; All of which may seem obtuse, but as an expatriate Brit who's made his life in the States, it's great to have the resource of both a solid American dictionary &amp; and an English one, especially if you work with words for a living ... and I really like the Oxford to cover the English side of things. It's very portable &amp; yet also thorough (though I note the objections of other reviewers). I guess Oxford has always been a bit slow on allowing new words/usages, but it is THE authority on English English, as opposed to American English. ... Which also means you don't want this dictionary if you're writing solely for an American audience because it will steer you wrong in some areas &amp; give you spellings not acceptable here. It's a great choice for Anglophiles, people writing for the U.K. market or doing business there, though. Reasonably priced, reasonably sized, usefully comprehensive. (My choice for the American side of things is &quot;Webster's New World&quot; mainly because it's the authority at most newspapers &amp; I'm often writing within style guidelines set by newspapers).	2001-10-14

I didn't expect either &quot;Hannibal&quot; or &quot;Dragon&quot; to be as good as &quot;Silence,&quot; but in their own ways they are. If you can, start with &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; then read the other two ... but the books also stand alone &amp; can be read out of sequence. There was more of Hannibal Lecter than I expected in &quot;Dragon&quot; (I'd heard he had virtually no role &amp; that's not the case) ... but it turns out Lecter isn't a requirement for a good Harris novel. In this one, both the hero (Will Graham) &amp; the primary villain (Francis Dolarhyde) are extremely well drawn. I like how Harris is willing to blur edges, which is true to life: we see a relatively nice side to Dolarhyde (some humanity shown with a date) &amp; we see not-so-nice sides of Graham (how strongly he identifies with murderers) &amp; this is true to real life, which lacks black &amp; white most of the time &amp; has more gray. Why is Graham good at what he does? Because he can relate to the villains he hunts. ... This is an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable start to a trilogy &amp; it's basically flawless, with the exception of a couple of pages of weak dialog. ... Well worth a read &amp; I guess if I had to rank the three it'd be 1. &quot;Lamb,&quot; 2. &quot;Dragon,&quot; &amp; 3. &quot;Hannibal,&quot; though they're all of a very close &amp; outstanding standard. Worth the money &amp; time.	2001-10-11

Morning pages are one of the key things (others include a weekly artist date &amp; the use of affirmations) &amp; this is a great volume to start in. I'm a slow learner so I actually went through four of these before I bought my own blank-paged journals. Things I like about this volume include that it forced me to fill a certain amount of space: there are three pages for each day &amp; that's what Cameron wants you to do &amp; this volume gives a very good guide of how much writing is desirable. I also like the quotations, the summaries of the goals for the coming week &amp; even the potentially cheesy contract with myself to commit to the process. Time IS an issue &amp; Cameron's 30 minutes is at least at the beginning optimistic, though that's what I now generally use. At first it might take longer, even significantly longer, but it's well worth it. I started writing morning pages in November 1998. Three years later, I am still writing them. They are a wonderful tool toward a clear head &amp; the working through of issues &amp; about the only thing I believe someone can do wrong in using them is to be afraid of letting whatever comes out come out. Coincidentally (I don't THINK so) I started serious work on my first, non-fiction book at the same time I started morning pages &amp; three years later I'm very close to finishing it, so I know the program works. It also goes very well with 12 Step programs, for people in those. If you buy this journal, also buy &quot;The Artist's Way,&quot; the book that lays it all out ... &amp; consider some of Cameron's little books of affirmations, which are outstanding. This is a wonderful tool and deserves five stars.	2001-10-03
US	51038303	R2IIQXBG5AZ7F7	0440224675	313045692	Hannibal	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Controversial ending makes an excellent point	I liked this as well as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; though for different reasons. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is broader in its locations &amp; has a wider range of well-developed characters, including some we've met before (it really is a good idea to read &quot;Silence ...&quot; first &amp; preferably &quot;Red Dragon&quot; before that). &quot;Hannibal&quot; grows from &quot;Silence ...&quot; Not just a repeat of that formula, it develops characters &amp; themes. Beyond the obvious characters, I especially liked the portrayals of Mason Verger &amp; his sister &amp; later Krendler. I love the ending &amp; wish very much that it hadn't been changed for the movie. It really weakened the movie, changing the outcome (&amp; the movies have otherwise been unusually good adaptations). What's great about the ending is that Harris makes a point we might not like at all &amp; might not want to hear but he's brave enough to make it anyway. It's certainly thought-provoking. I believe the reason for our interest in characters such as Dr. Lecter has much to do with what they tell us about ourselves. I'll leave it at that, not to spoil the ending ... which might be annoying but certainly isn't weak. This is well worth a read, even if you've seen the movie.	2001-09-27

Highlights include the ambiguity over Binion's exact cause of death &amp; description of Binion &amp; the gold digger. German nicely portrays the killers' initial belief they'll get away with it &amp; their growing realization they won't. The use of forensic pathologist experts Michael Baden &amp; Cyril Wecht on opposing sides in the same trial is well done, as is the background politics to their appearances. German intimates possible wider ties (was the Mob involved?) without overstating the case. He also does a good job of showing how the case is an entirely circumstantial one. Weaknesses include insufficient characterization of Las Vegas as a place (I believe German assumes we know what it's like--it's a shame he doesn't use his descriptive powers to conjure up this unique place better, especially as he's a reporter there &amp; could probably do a fine job of this). There also are tiresome references to the Las Vegas Sun's coverage of the story, the media in general &amp; the alleged fame of the trial. Only journalists care who covered a story &amp; how ... only the media cares which TV shows broadcast what, especially after the fact ... &amp; the trial's fame is best judged by the reader, who either has or has not heard of the case prior to reading the book. Less &quot;insider&quot; description &amp; names of relevance only to a small circle of Las Vegas law enforcement/justice officials &amp; more geographical description, perhaps even more characterization of the victim &amp; his killers, would've helped. But a solid, quick, unconfusing read.	2001-09-26

Don't start reading Adams with this book--start with &quot;Watership Down.&quot; ... Some of the dialect (especially that of the Tod) will be very difficult for American readers (though it was slightly toned down for American editions) &amp; it's perhaps hard to follow if you've never heard the real thing, but even it is brilliant. I have heard the real thing &amp; Adams captures it perfectly. It works best if you read it quickly. ... Adams does some wonderful experimentation with the writing in the book, experimentation that draws on a vast literary heritage &amp; demonstrates very wide reading, experimentation that is itself a tribute to his literary forefathers. ... The characters, especially the canine ones, are very well-drawn (I'm tempted to call my next dog Rowf). ... Good plot twists, evocative geographical description, a singularly haunting passage about a ghost, great description of snow. ... The animal experimentation theme is very well done, not overstated (all of the experiments Adams described were real) &amp; while it's obvious where Adams stands, he has the guts to balance the debate with an unexpected portrait of a dying child. ... The true brilliance of this book lies in the ending, which is just an absolute work of art, drawing together narrative strings, switching narrative styles, switching points of view, speeding up &amp; slowing down (&amp; even incorporating the author's tribute to his own friends without becoming excessively idiosyncratic) until it becomes positively lyrical. The book is worth it for the ending alone ... &amp; Adams is a master of making the incredible credible so we willingly suspend disbelief ... maybe because Rowf &amp; Snitter are so well portrayed we sorely want them to live. Not an easy read, but SO good.	2001-08-24
US	51038303	RBEKE6H8C3MV2	0812910826	662695465	Inside the Criminal Mind	Books	5	79	95	N	N	Extremely accessible, well-written, no-nonsense account	Dr. Stanton Samenow doesn't discuss WHY criminals are what they are because, he admits, we don't know and because, more importantly, who cares? WHY isn't the issue, nor was it his objective in writing. What's important is that we recognize the criminal mind &amp; what might be done to fix it, both of which he addresses excellently. (It similarly is of little importance WHY a person has cancer or why they are an addict--what's pressing to them is being cured or having their addiction arrested). ... I spent 17 months visiting and corresponding with a young convicted murderer for a non-fiction book. I hadn't read Samenow's book beforehand, so I had no preconceptions from his work. Reading it afterwards, I find his description of the criminal stunningly accurate, down to fine details. ... Samenow's book isn't bogged down with a lot of attribution &amp; statistics because he's speaking with the authority of being partner with Dr. Samuel Yochelson, the three volumes they wrote together, the work at St. Elizabeths (for more in depth, read their work, &quot;The Criminal Personality.&quot;) ... Meanwhile, this book is a very accessible, understandable, accurate, well-written description designed for a much wider audience that really cuts away all the myths &amp; challenges the reader to be compassionate not by excusing the criminal but by asking him to accept responsibility, the first step to a cure. ... If Samenow's solution sounds a lot like a 12 Step program without overt spirituality, that's not a criticism--12 Step programs have proven to be the most effective way to approach alcoholism and other addictions. No approach to alcoholism has ever been more successful than Alcoholics Anonymous, which is now more than 60 years old. All approaches have very high failure rates, just as attempts to cure cancers have high failure rates (&amp; crime and addiction are as serious to the individual &amp; to society as cancer). Comparing Samenow's ideas to AA's 12 Steps is, thus, hardly a criticism. ... Samenow's basic message is 1. the criminal thinks differently from the responsible person, 2. the criminal chooses crime, 3. the criminal's only possible outcomes are to continue their behavior, to commit suicide or to change, 4. many of the excuses we make for criminals are wrong and also not truly empathetic or compassionate and even sometimes covertly racist, 5. what criminals say after the fact is unimportant, it's their antecedent patterns of thought and action that matter, 6. only a change in thought patterns can help a criminal. ... He makes the excellent point that rehabilitation is sort of an odd concept since the word implies a return to a previous state of being, yet most lifelong criminals have never known anything other than what they are so how could they be rehabilitated? This is similar to the idea of recovery for the addict--recovery to what? I was always an addict: I'm not REcovering (God forbid!), I'm changing my entire approach to life, which is also the only way out for the criminal. ...

Some very good thoughts on murder &amp; murderers throughout. I wanted some of these developed more, &amp; I wanted a better understanding of how Drew Ross, M.D. reached certain conclusions, especially his conclusion that punishment is a crime. It's an excellent (maybe even brave) topic, but I don't get a sense of how Ross got there--he just comes out and says it. The book is accessible to laypeople as well as professionals. It's a quick read. Some of the patient profiles are quite well done, but again I would've liked more rather than less. The book is a very good introductory survey of many of the issues raised dealing with murderers. It's sometimes brave--commendable in insisting on not demonizing murderers &amp; on facing the killer within all of us. Ross is commendably honest about himself. His book also is interesting for its insights into the path taken by a psychiatrist dealing with criminals--for its examination of the realizations Ross came to as he dealt with his subjects, for its mapping of his own psychic journey. Again, he's open &amp; honest about this. He's not afraid to show his limitations, not arrogant despite his education. His ultimate conclusion is startling, best not spoiled by being revealed in a review ... &amp; I wish he'd written at greater length about it, with more explanation of how he got there. Bottom line, not enough development of very good ideas, not enough specifics, not enough of the route to his ideas ... but a very good survey of the issues &amp; a worthwhile read that ought to interest both criminal justice professionals &amp; true crime enthusiasts.	2001-07-25

Wow, I'm glad I did. First, it validates the movie in that it truly was a brilliant film because it was so faithful to the book &amp; so wonderfully well cast. But the book is better. I am a highly critical reader, &amp; I find not a flaw in this diamond. It's believable; Harris isn't afraid to make Lecter likeable; every single character is strong, even the dog; the research is obviously excellent; there isn't a bad patch in the book; and, on top of all this, it's written with such wonderful economy--I visualize the scenes powerfully, yet this is achieved in just a few sentences each time. It's 367 pages, &amp; that just doesn't seem enough space to make it work, but Harris pulls it off wonderfully.

No one mentions Wolfe's 24-page introduction, 'Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast,' which is excellent in itself as an overview of the alleged death of the novel, The New Journalism, non-fiction v. fiction &amp; his own evolution as a writer. The introduction is worth a read on its own if you're a journalism student, a would-be or actual writer or just interested in the publishing world. As for the rest of the book, it's excellent. Wolfe is a master of the set piece, the extended vignette beautifully observing a situation or person. He is not so good at endings, which is why I picked four stars rather than five. I felt identically about his later &quot;A Man in Full,&quot; and it didn't stop me enjoying the heck out of the book. If you enjoy his fiction, his non-fiction is well worth checking out as great examples of very controlled, observant reporting &amp; writing. I particularly enjoyed &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House,&quot; an extended essay about modern architecture, and &quot;The Painted Word,&quot; ditto on modern art.	2001-06-30

This is a disciplined, tight, wonderfully controlled novel in which Barker's skills include her ability to conjure up powerful images in very few words, flawless dialog &amp; excellent character portraits. A good story is told in a very short space, making it a quick (&amp; difficult to put down) read. There's a cultural issue that might make the novel a bit less credible to U.S. readers: it's true that in Britain young murderers can be released quite quickly &amp; when they are, they are given new identities. So far as I know, this never happens in the U.S. &amp; the prevailing social sentiment would seem to be against it. Actually, though, it's of course a very humane if risky &amp; experimental approach. Barker's novel couldn't be more relevant in Britain at present: two boys (Robert Thompson &amp; Jon Venables) are being released under new identities after being held in custody for the 1993 murder of 2-year-old James Bulger. The issues surrounding their release (threats of violent vengeance, questions of reform, an out-of-control media frenzy) are identical to those surrounding Danny Miller. ... I've spent more than two years working on a non-fiction book about a group of young killers &amp; this included lengthy interviews with several members of the group, including the ringleader, &amp; based on this, Barker's depiction of Danny is brilliant. She must've done considerable &amp; thorough research to have some of the nuances down. ... My only quibble is the idea Danny doesn't remember two key events in the book (I won't spoil it by saying too much) is silly. People can be shocked after committing a serious crime, but I don't personally believe that they are unaware of what they're doing at the time &amp;, more to the point, it isn't convincingly done in the novel. It just comes across as silly the two times Danny zones out. ... Despite that, this is brilliant &amp; a must-read for true crime enthusiasts, those interested in juvenile crime &amp; people pondering issues of punishment, reform, rehabilitation and the ability (or not) to change.me enthusiasts, those interested in juvenile crime &amp; people pondering issues of punishment, reform, rehabilitation and the ability (or not) to change.	2001-06-25

I was very concerned Thompson's books would all be alike after I read &amp; loved &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; ... &amp; they're not at all ... this is a completely different style from that or from, say, &quot;South of Heaven&quot; or &quot;Now And On Earth.&quot; I've read one other book that used this approach, John Burnham Schwartz's much more recent &amp; also excellent &quot;Reservation Road&quot; &amp; it works very well for both writers. Thompson is wonderfully controlled with it, keeping things short &amp; tight. I love how many people assume young Bob Talbert is innocent &amp; railroaded ... in fact, Thompson leaves the question of his innocence or guilt entirely with the reader &amp; it's beautifully ambiguous, especially if the reader is familiar with the sociopathic personality which, without ever saying it, Thompson gives Talbert plenty of room to be. Thompson was ahead of his time understanding criminals &amp;  perhaps much of it was intuitive, from what he knew about himself. Whatever his personal weaknesses he was very brave in showing people's inherent capacity for evil, without apologizing for it. It's in Thompson's ability to see the universal capacity for evil that his humanity lies.	2001-06-21

By modern standards, it's tame. The title seems an exageration, given Thompson's self-censoring repression of anything truly ribald, profane or shocking ... though maybe this is more a reflection of where pop culture has come today than of Thompson. That said, the book is extremely funny in places &amp; a great insight into the writer. For the truth behind Thompson's stories, try Robert Polito's excellent biography, &quot;Savage Art,&quot; which is a must for anyone who gets really interested in Thompson anyway. If you read many Thompson books, there's a good chance you'll get seriously interested.	2001-06-20

Sure, the atmosphere is wonderful &amp; Marlowe is a great character ... but the plot's confusing &amp; tiresome &amp; I'm not impressed by hearing that's because he wanted to achieve a certain impression.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I've read a couple of the others &amp; they're better (if, for example, you read &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; I guarantee you'll want to read more of what Thompson wrote). Highly recommend reading Robert Polito's outstanding biography of Jim Thompson, &quot;Savage Art,&quot; early on if you get even a teeny bit hooked on Thompson. Polito did a wonderful job putting everything in context, not just of Thompson's life but of the times in which he lived &amp; the book is just a super companion to a serious reading of Thompson from which you'll learn much about, for example, how much of &quot;Now and On Earth&quot; is autobiographical. As for the novel, the descriptions of an aircraft manufacturing plant drag a bit at times but it's otherwise a wonderfully dark portrait of a struggling family and, in particular, a struggling young writer not unlike the author. Don't read the book expecting typical crime fiction because that's not at all what you get--it's not at all like Thompson classics such as &quot;The Killer Inside Me.&quot; What you get here is really an extended vignette or character study (the plot is of minimal importance) &amp; it's excellent.	2001-06-04

This book is better than average. It grew on me as I read it. It would've grown on me even more if Pence had explored the issues between Betty Beets &amp; her children even further, but it was good even as it was &amp; that no doubt would be very difficult to get at.	2001-05-18

The format differs from the other two books (they are 'Heart Steps,' which is focused on creativity, &amp; 'Blessings,' focused on heartfulness) in that it has an affirmation followed by a simple suggested action (the others only have affirmations). The suggested actions aren't difficult--they require just a little mental effort or resolution. The subject matter was a great choice. It is, as the title implies, change. The book is ideal for anyone facing a major event such as a death, wedding, move, career change. ... All three of these books, even in paperback, are very nicely presented, with sturdier covers &amp; higher quality paper &amp; printing than is typical &amp; this is a good thing because they're the sort of thing you'll want to keep around &amp; savor repeatedly. ... If this is the first Cameron effort you're considering, you're in for a treat: with almost no exceptions (but avoid the over-priced, poorly conceived 'Artist's Way Creativity Kit') Cameron's stuff is outstanding &amp; a great asset to anyone in recovery, expanding or trying to change, especially in creative directions such as writing.

First off, read Maureen Orth's 'Vulgar Favors' before reading Indiana's book--the two are a very good combination &amp; Orth's book (which I also like, though less than Indiana's) gives a good idea how seriously to take Indiana's unusual technique. In at least two significant ways, Indiana's is the better book: he doesn't make the mistake of flailing around for some sort of conspiracy theory to explain Cunanan's murder of Versace and he convincingly discounts drug-use that Orth rather unwisely buys into. Also, his is better written. As to the debate about Indiana's fictionalization or creative non-fiction or whatever, it's certainly no more of a sin than anything Truman Capote did in 'In Cold Blood,' which if you take the time to read about it (e.g. George Plimpton's account) you'll see was fictionalized (though my edition was sold as NONFICTION/LITERATURE). Indiana is up-front about what he did, laying it out in the beginning, in the prefaces, specifying what he invented, which is good to know 'cause he has some excellent quotations from Cunanan's writings that are NOT fictionalized. Indiana isn't SYMPATHIZING with Cunanan, he's EMPATHIZING, &amp; therein lies a world of difference &amp; empathy with a murderer is no bad thing if you want to understand, which presumably would be one of the chief reasons to buy the book. Murderers are human &amp; Indiana has a nice quotation from Gore Vidal about that in the beginning (if you want to see a killer, go look in the mirror). Indiana glorifies the murders much less than 90 percent of conventional 'true crime' books, which often seem to go overboard perhaps partly to justify their publication (gee, this murder was more brutal than most &amp; that's why we need yet another account of yet another murder). Weaknesses of 'Three Month Fever' include that Indiana's sense of place is, as someone else commented, not very good at all ... but then the places are maybe not so very important in this book, which is surely mostly about the PLACE of Cunanan's mind &amp; our collective minds reacting to Cunanan. It's a weakness for Indiana to claim, as he does, that he's invented a new approach, 'cause that's just not true, all the way back to 'In Cold Blood.' Nor is it true if you know anything about the much discussed 'new journalism' of people such as Tom Wolfe. The prose is overblown, but this might be deliberate, since it reflects the sort of overblown verbiage one would have heard from Cunanan &amp; also it is, frankly, beautifully queeny, really evocative of the way some queens present themselves, really well done. So maybe it's intentional. Certainly Indiana has a hypothesis &amp; that's all it can be, but it rings a good deal truer than Orth's, where hers collapses in her apparent inability to grasp that a sociopath might kill for the sake of killing &amp; for no other reason. People seem to think there's no way Indiana could know much of what he writes. I beg to differ. It's astonishing how much one can get from court records, investigative reports, etc., including entire conversations essentially reconstructed &amp; perhaps people don't realize that. I strongly suspect the big surprise if we all knew a lot more about this book would be how much of it is NOT fictionalized. ... But the bottom line is that SOME people CAN put themselves in certain other people's minds. Sure, every detail won't be accurate. But the general sense of things will feel chillingly true, as it does here. I suspect Indiana has as much right as anyone to do what he did. Most of us couldn't imagine Cunanan's viewpoint, but I think Indiana can &amp; he does it very well ... &amp; he's very honest about it all &amp; we're free to disagree if we wish, just like we're free to turn off the TV if we don't like it. ... This is a well-written, really thought-provoking, compelling, mostly very convincing, brave book. One final question: Would you rather read YET ANOTHERformulaic, poorly written, newspapery 'true crime' book or would you rather read something different, fresh, more challenging? If your answer is the latter, buy &amp; read Indiana's book (preferably in hardback ... I can't imagine why the paperback of this not very long book is abridged).formulaic, poorly written, newspapery 'true crime' book or would you rather read something different, fresh, more challenging?

Happily, my fear was unfounded ... &amp; I was delighted how different 'South of Heaven' is from 'The Killer ...' &amp; how I got not only a fun piece of crime fiction but also something that evoked some of the same feelings as 'The Grapes of Wrath,' if written entirely differently. Thompson does an excellent job portraying the hard lives of the pipeliners without boring the reader. Tommy Burwell is a great character, too. ... I hope Thompson is in the midst of being rediscovered (judging by how many of his books are in print, maybe so) &amp; I know I'm gonna enjoy him as much as Graham Greene (who's my all-time favorite writer), if for entirely different reasons. Greene, who was a wonderful writer, dismissed his own books as mere &quot;entertainments.&quot; The same could easily be (wrong-headedly) said of the two Thompson books I've read thus far ... but oh man are they ever entertaining.	2001-04-04

French chose a crime that, on the face of it, might not leap out as fodder for a newspaper series, let alone the book it later became. It was grisly &amp; no doubt devastating for everyone whose lives it directly touched (what murder isn't?) but it hardly seems sensational ... &amp; that's French's achievement in &quot;Unanswered Cries.&quot; He makes you care about the victim, the crime, the do-nothing neighbors &amp;--yes--even about the murderer. French does a particularly good job of illuminating the victim &amp; her friends &amp; family without overdoing it. Murderers' actions have consequences far beyond the death of their victim ... &amp; French documents that very well.	2001-04-04

She herself convincingly (&amp; tastefully, based on clear evidence, without overstating) demonstrated the links between Cunanan &amp; all his victims (with the exception of the unfortunate owner of the red pickup), including Miglin &amp; Versace ... so why does she give any time at all to the idea that Versace was killed out of anything other than Cunanan's pathology? Isn't it enough that the two knew each other &amp; Cunanan was a bitter hustler who'd fallen over the edge into a sociopathic bloodlust? It seems naive, actually, to want this to be more than the product of Cunanan's twisted mind, as though that weren't enough or as though his psyche was so twisted &amp; dark that Orth just can't comprehend it &amp; must look for more rational explanations, reaching for a Mafia hit or whatever. I think this, the only major weakness of the book, is a case of getting perhaps too close to the story, staring at it too long &amp; starting to see what isn't there. It's a really strange mis-reading of things in such an otherwise strong, well-researched, well told book. The book has been criticized as a negative portrayal of the gay community, but I don't think that's fair--it's not that Orth has a disgust towards gay life, it's that the aspect she necessarily portrays in the book (because it's a huge part of the story &amp; the motivations) IS pretty disgusting. It's not that Orth is disgusted in some judgmental way, I think--it's US that are disgusted by what she shows us &amp; want to attack the messenger for telling us. A very readable &amp; compelling book that sometimes feels a bit gossipy, but under the circumstances that tone fits. Also contains a few annoying grammatical &amp; spelling errors in an otherwise fine manuscript.	2001-03-24

The book is weakened by following a familiar true crime formula that includes a chunk of the usual trial description, none of which is especially noteworthy &amp; which becomes irritating when we're actually subjected to a second trial of one of the characters. The book would have been improved by more exploration of the friendship between Anderson &amp; Baranyi &amp; more insight relating them to other incidents. Reang is astute to make the comparison with Leopold &amp; Loeb. I just wish there'd been more of this kind of thing &amp; less formula.	2001-03-22

A very good read nevertheless &amp; it gets better as it goes along, peaking at the end (which isn't as obvious a point as it might seem--too few books in this genre deliver consistency &amp; a sense of building to a climax). The opening &amp; closing scenes (DON'T read ahead) are an excellent touch &amp; all that the authors lay out in the book justifies the closing scene--they prove their speculation is worth listening to (&amp; it's very convincing, actually). Even the obligatory trial scene is very well done. High points of the book are the portrait of Ken Register, who becomes convincingly darker as the book progresses, and the community &amp; just the right amount of commentary on the broad type of person Ken Register represents without overdoing it. Definitely worth buying &amp; reading.	2001-03-22

All the characters, including both boys and both wives, are excellently drawn. The book's just a pleasure to read as a piece of craftsmanship, dark subject matter notwithstanding. The only fault I could find is the somewhat sporadic appearance of the Learner dog, who sort of gets forgotten for a while &amp; then suddenly reappears, &amp; that's a very, very minor flaw in an outstanding novel. I'll make a point of reading whatever Schwartz writes.	2001-02-06

Lamar Pye, Bud Pewtie and Richard Peed are extremely well drawn for such a fast-paced book. I found Odell unconvincing, even a bit silly. Among the lesser characters, I especially liked Lt. C.D. Henderson. What bothered me about an otherwise fine violent action thriller was having my willing suspension of disbelief so exploited at times, especially over the issue of Bud Pewtie's considerable injuries &amp; his repeated ability to get back up &amp; plunge into another fight, which reminded me of bad horror movies where the bad guy keeps getting back up again and again every time we think he's dead. That said, the book is thoroughly entertaining if you don't mind violent sociopathy.	2001-02-05

Striving to avoid pretense, he's ironically written a classic ... &amp; maybe that's part of the point he keeps making about truth &amp; honesty: you can't be great until you just be. He's beautifully truthful &amp; honest here. I laughed out loud. I was inspired. I was struck how well he conveys simple but very hard to express concepts, such as intuition. I loved his idea about writing as telepathy. I was surprised how gripping his account of his near-fatal crash was. Though focused on fiction, this is well worth a read by ANY writer or would-be writer in ANY genre. There's much for the non-fiction writer. This joins William Zinsser's &quot;On Writing Well&quot; &amp; Strunk &amp; White as my favorites.

What we get instead is a sober laying out of the facts through great use of detail and a strong narrative. I went into the book a little skeptical and underinformed about Ruby Ridge and emerged horrified at what happened, particularly by the behavior of the feds. But Walter doesn't try to make Weaver a pure hero either, showing his eccentricities and willingly raising questions about his handling of the situation such as whether Weaver used his children as a buffer between himself and danger.  The obligatory court section of the book is saved from the boring recitation of trial that often characterizes non-fiction, true crime books by an excellent portrait of lawyer Gerry Spence and very nice detail on the jury's lengthy deliberations.  Walter ties Ruby Ridge, Waco and Oklahoma City together very nicely without overdoing it. He's a master of understatement, leaving the reader to form his own conclusions. He includes a very good, concise history of the Aryan Nations/militia/freemen/patriot radical right-wing movement.  This is a must-read for any student of the radical right-wing movement, especially anyone open-minded enough to be willing to accept that the government has made some horrific, perhaps criminal errors ... and that some of those errors have fanned the flames of hatred more effectively than any racist demagogue.	2000-11-20

I also  love Cameron's brand of sprituality because it neither whacks  non-Christians over the head with Christianity nor criticizes  Christians--it's ideal for anyone independently seeking their own  conception of a Higher Power, including those skeptical about traditional  organized religion.

ANYONE who deals with kids &amp; teens or ANYONE who's mystified why some adult they know reads comics, this book will change what you thought you knew. I read it as research before reading Japanese comics  as an attempt to better understand a specific group of teens I'm writing  about. I hadn't read many comics ever, beyond Asterix, Tintin, Maus II,  Bloom County, Calvin &amp; Hobbes, Dilbert &amp; Mutts. I thought I knew  what comics were (for children, entertainment, very rarely serious,  simple). I was wrong on every count. For my specific needs, I especially  appreciated McCloud's discussion of manga &amp; it's greatly helped my  subsequent reading of manga. Many of the ideas he discusses--such as  thoughts on the space between panels--are just downright enlightening &amp;  thought-provoking. Just one example for me was his suggestions on how  comics are not something we merely observe but something we become, which  really helped me grasp the appeal. McCloud literally opened a new world to  me, comics, leading me to enjoy them for pleasure, not just one research  project. Perhaps his greatest achievement is that it is his own  book--Understanding Comics--that becomes the very best reason to listen to  McCloud's insistent plea to take comics seriously &amp; give them their  rightful credit. This book is truly outstanding &amp; especially  recommended to those who would scoff.	2000-05-03

Moss is honest in explaining to the reader his deception of the killers he wrote. His methods leave more questions  than answers. One wonders, indeed, as another reviewer noted, where the  lies begin and end. One also wonders how honest Moss is with himself. I was  left with the feeling his own interpretation of what he did and why will  change as he gets older. Moss' ego is annoying in the book (five of 12  photos include pictures of Moss) &amp; he is at times naive &amp; awkwardly  condescending in his prose. On the other hand, the book is as revealing of  its author as it is of the killers, it's clear its author hasn't truly  grappled with the issues raised by what he did &amp; it's perhaps most  interesting in this respect. It's competently written. It barely mentions  the killers' victims, nor does its author express any concern that seems  real at all for the victims. The book is unique. I can think of none others  like it among the many true crime books I've read. Though Moss at times  seems to have an inflated sense of importance &amp; though he fails to  deliver the promised insight into his subjects, he certainly dared to try  something different &amp; put himself out there to be criticized or  praised.	2000-04-25
