This book is now in it's second edition, and the update is well worth the $20 investment. The authors give the best all around introduction to the subject that I have seen. What I like about their approach is that they don't claim to have all the answers and they seem to understand that this is a field that is in evolotion. What's great about the book is that it's in plain English and is aimed at programmers and graphic designers who don't have a degree in library science. What I enjoyed most about the book is that there is quite a bit of good common sense. Not only would I recommend this book to someone starting in the field, but I would also say that if you are an old timer it's a worthwhile read to get a better taste of what best industry practices are these days. While the book has some illustrated examples, it manages not to be a pretty picture book which tells you what you already know.	2003-04-27
US	52842205	R2FYS2P1KTXBTH	0743223136	747139631	John Adams	Books	4	0	2	N	N	McMullough makes Magic	David McCullough not only allows you to get to know John Adams, but in addition gives the reader a very good sense of the primitive but proud world that was America in the 18th Century. More than just a biography of Adams you get a very honest portrait of the founding fathers - Washington and Jefferson go from being statues to being real people with flaws - but not in a negitive way, but in a personable way. In fact you almost feel that you are hanging out with John Adams as he lives through the birth of the United States.<br />While this biography didn't go into the same level of detail that his Truman epic did, you still get a very personal portrait of man from 200 years away. As with Truman the author seems to gravitate to interesting people who get overlooked by history - and in this case he shines a wonderful light. What's also wonderful is that it's as much a biography of Abigail Adams as it is of John Adams. McCullough is also honest in looking at the flaws in his subject, for example showing the mistakes of the Alien and Sedition Acts. But in the process by making Adams more human you feel more sympathy for him. <br />This is a book that should be read by anyone wanting to get a better idea of what went into the creation of the United States - and what set it apart from other events of the day like the French Revolution. In fact the book shows a wonderful contrast of America and Europe in the 18th Century.	2002-10-26

The author was very involved in the pre-9/11 world of Jihad, so his travels paint a vivid picture of the people and world of this sub-culture. I guess I found it distrubring that one claiming to be inspired by religion would be so obessed with the details of war - and killing people. But I found myself continuing to read this book because it did give me insights into who these people are and why they do what they do.<br />Instead of seeing a well run secret organization out of a James Bond novel one is pretty surprised how disorganized the terrorist groups can be. I was also pretty surpised to read the accounts of the Russian military and find out how corrupt they could be. In one chapter you find out that the Russian border guards are taking bribes to let in fighters who will be killing their own. Of course on the other side you also read accounts of infighting and sell-outs of the Jihad inspired organizations. To top it off his insights on American intelligence organizations show their efforts in a less than positive light. One hopes that we can learn from these insights and apply the lessons.<br />I would recommend the book to anyone trying who is trying to get a better idea about the sub-culture of terrorism. While I couldn't agree with the point of view of the author, I found the book a pretty good source for insights into this underground world. Having seen the results of terrorism upclose my feelings are that it's a subject that needs to be explored further.	2002-10-20

Instead Cross had presented a well researched biography of Kurt Cobain, which while exploring his subject with sympathy also never fails to be honest. The honesty isn't just about the lack of glam associated with being a drug addict, but also gives a bitter raste of the music industry.<br />Based on a wide range of interviews Cross gives you enough detail where you get a good feeling for Cobain. He also manages to show the differences between the PR and the real person (or Kurt vs. Kurdt). This book brings to life the Seattle music scene of the late 80's and early 90's, a subject that's only starting to be explored by other writers. In the process Cross has created more than a picture of a rock star, but gives future generations a taste of America from the last days of the 20th Century.<br />The only major flaw in this book is that while it goes into great detail on Cobain, it would be nice if he went into more detail on his friends and peers from the same period (ala Robert Caro). Sadly next to other bios I have read this is a very quick read, however this owes more to the fact that Cobain did die at an early age of 27 than due to editing down for a mass market. After reading the book you still feel that you don't quite know Kurt Cobain, but you do have a much better idea of his life and where he came from.	2002-09-14

While you can see an echo of this look in almost every graphic design award annual today, Chantry has been working in this style since the late 70's. And while many have borrowed his approach, few have been able to imitate it with the same sense of grit, humor, color and power.<br />True to the title of the book \\"Some People Can't Surf\\" there isn't one website design to be found, but that may not be a bad thing as Chantry is a master within his medium. A very large body of work that spans three decades is showcased which includes everything from his very first poster design for a school concert to promotional work for major Hollywood record labels. One pleasant surprise is seeing quite a bit of logo design work which involves the charm and craft of hand lettering. In end Chantry reminds one of a later day Milton Glaser with a punk rock point of view.<br />At some points the book can become too crammed by trying to jam several posters onto a page by shrinking them down to matchbook size, however the work holds up pretty well under the strain. This volume would be valuable to any graphic designer looking for inspiration or anyone who is a fan of the Seattle music from the 90's.	2001-12-01

While he was alive Tibor Kalman spent his design career showing that one could find &quot;high art&quot; in the everyday world. (un) Fashion is a wonderful tribute to the life of Mr. Kalman (it can be assume that the driving force behind the book is Maira who is a very talented artist in her own right). <br />The book has several catwalks of a wide range of people from every corner the planet. Each chapter features a traditional or (un)traditional fashion theme like body art, accessories, tribes, dressed to kill and (un)mentionables. Sometimes a featured photo can make a political statement while others show a slight touch of humor, making for entertaining page turning.<br />While this book isn't your typical &quot;oversized coffee table&quot; the production and presentation show a respect for quality. Unlike your average overpriced collection of pretty pictures this book will make you think, which is rather novel for a book of so few words. (un)Fashion is the sort of book which you will want to share with friends and family and would be a great conversation starter for any social gathering.	2001-11-12

Almost 20 years ago Bob Gill (who was one of the founders of Pentagram) wrote a book called &quot;Forget All the Rules of Graphic Design&quot;, and now Graphis has published an updated version. Why is this book so good? While most graphic designers since the 80's have focused on making things look pretty (or not so pretty) Gill was part of a generation who thought that the focus of graphic design should be to communicate - and be clever at it! <br />Unlike &quot;Forget All the Rules of Graphic Design&quot; this new edition is small and can be read on a subway. Gill has added a few new examples of his work, and he has revised some old designs (including the cover design of the old book). The cover of book reads &quot;If this book helps only one designer get one original idea, then all of the months I spent putting it together will not have been worth it.&quot;, while Bob Gill may suffer a slight case of ego - he has helped many people find new ideas and inspiration.	2001-09-16

Since the 80's (and rise of Microsoft) it has been fashionable to push software as the future, and Fingleton tackles that myth with gusto! It's also important to keep in mind that the author wrote this book before the internet bubble burst on the stock market, which gives me even more respect for the book. <br />As someone working in the software business I found that Fingleton has some blind spots and can go a bit too far, but he still has a voice that should be heard. While the book has some flaws (I didn't find all the information on target) it still opened some doors for me and made me think, and that alone is a good reward for any reader.	2001-09-03

My copy of the book didn't come with the CD-ROM so I can't comment on that aspect of the publication, however the book alone is worth the investment. While the best brush script should be done by hand, this book is the next best thing. Within 100 pages Solo has a nice variety of typefaces, the best of which have that wonderful kitsch feeling. <br />This book is perfect if you are looking for a groovy sixties or fat fifties script font. However some parts of the collection have a few faces that aren't so great, for example everyone must have a copy or version of \\"Baloon Extra Bold\\". But there are a few jems every few pages, so you won't be let down if you are trying to get that fifties classified ad look - or need a script font that looks like it feel off of a Doors album cover.<br />Professional designers should take careful note of the copyright notice, as you are only allowed to use only six words in any project. While I find this limiting, ... one can't be too let down!	2001-09-03

Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Good History of Telecommunications	While the focus of this book tends to be the mix of telecommunication AND politics, Neuman does a great job at giving a history lesson. This book came out during the high point of internet hype - and Johanna Neuman did a great job of pointing out that previous technology breakthroughs (like the telegraph) really did change the world. Until I read this book I had overlooked the revolution of the now humble space satellite without which we wouldn't have CNN. This book would be a GREAT read for anyone into history, politics and technology. If you haven't read &quot;Lights, Camera, War&quot; dont wait for the publisher to get it into paperback, do yourself a favor and buy a used copy!	2001-03-04

While the introduction is a bit short for those new to the subject, the rest of the book features interpretations which are very sharp and relate to a &quot;western&quot; point of view. Where many I Ching books have a specific focus (like the &quot;Buddhist I Ching&quot; or &quot;the I Ching of Romance&quot;) each hexagram has three sets of interpretations which allow you to get a business, relationship or spiritual oriented take on any question. The insights are filled with many current references, and Reifler avoids the trap getting too &quot;new age&quot; or literal about his subject. Don't judge this book by the cover, it's a classic that has now been around for over 25 years. If you already own a translation or two of this book, you may want to think about adding this edition to your library.	2001-02-16

He does this by showing how different societies across the globe deal (or doesn't deal) with economics. There aren't complicated charts, just the facts of how everyday people make a living. You can see how socialism does much better in Sweden than in Cuba, or how capitalism works wonders in Hong Kong but bombs in Albania. What I like about the book is that O'Rourke brings a very open mind to the subject, and doesn't get caught up in ideology. In fact he does a rather good job of bringing complex economic theory down to earth so everyone can understand it. <br />But P.J. falls a bit short in the humor department. When he isn't working it too hard his wit does comes through, but by trying to be &quot;so cool&quot; O'Rourke comes off as a bit dated and dull after a while. I wouldn't mind this so much, but the lame jokes get in the way of some good ideas, and an otherwise rare interesting exploration of economics. However the book is a worthy read, and with some editing might even stand the test of time.	2001-02-13

BUT if you are a newbie to creating websites, then this book is a poor place to start. I purchased this book for a friend who wanted to get up and running, and while I know there is no substitute for a human teacher - this guide was a poor textbook at best. The chapters don't explain the basic concepts behind websites, so while the reader can find out how to use Dreamweaver to make frames, tables and CSS - there is little to nothing on what a &quot;dummy&quot; would find useful (example: how to make text a specific color). This book has too much fluff with chapters like &quot;Fulfilling Your Dreams&quot; and &quot;Making It Cool&quot; but very little about the basic lessons a beginner could use.	2001-02-11

There are some great explanations on the concept of angels(no they aren't cherubs with wings) and that the idea that words themselves are sacred. The book however lacks detail in other areas (example: why are there only good or bad angels, but not neutral angels?). At other points the book gives you a little bit on reincarnation, but after you read about it you want an additional chapter on the subject!<br />I would also have liked a comparison to other religions, as the book tends to focus more on what something is rather than why. For example there is information on the tradition of not mixing meat and dairy, but I found myself still wondering why this was important? But to be fair the book does pack quite a bit into less than 200 pages.<br />So this book is good for opening doors on the subject, but don't expect a Cliff Notes overview or definitive encyclopedia. I did find it an enjoyable read, and liked the fact that it touched on a broad range of subjects which include Jewish views on faith, food and sex. On the whole it's a good quick read on a deep subject.	2001-01-25

I got turned onto Zubrin through his previous book &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; which is one of the most important books on space exploration done in the last twenty years. So I came to this book with a high set of expectations.<br />Where the Mars book was very specific, this book deals with the big picture. This works well when Zubrin goes into detail, but things fall apart when he is too theoretical. For example he gives a great survey on various potential methods for interstellar travel - but tends to get lost on more subjective topics like &quot;if the aliens are out there&quot;.<br />At heart Zubrin is an engineer, and this is where he shines. Even when he is taking apart previous concepts like L5 space colonies or Dyson spheres he is doing it with care and love. He does get a bit technical, and as I don't have a professional understanding of physics I did have to wonder at points if he was 100% on the level or not. Zubrin also tends to be a bit lost when he is dealing with non-tech topics like economics or politics, but you can excuse this because he is a non-apologetic advocate of his cause.<br />If you are already into the subject matter this book is a must have addition for your personal library. However this book may be a bit much if you are new to the topic or get turned off by seeing scientific equations. But if you love the stuff like me, then you gotta have it! Now that it's in paperback you can also get a copy or two for your other geek friends.	2001-01-23

While this edition may be out of print, it would be a worthy addition to any personal or professional creative library. So if you don't own this book it's well worth the wait or extra fee.<br />While the work presented here has a very dated 70's look to - that not what's important. The idea behind the work is that the graphic design communicates an idea. Each page in the book starts by giving you an &quot;orginal problem&quot; from a client - and then shows how Gill comes up with a solution to to not only solving the problem , but to redefine it. Gill uses a wide range of styles to solve his problems including plain typography, illustration and photography. His work is very clever, and is the opposite of people who just make pretty pictures.<br />This book would also be great for a copywriter or anyone trying to understand creative communication. If you can't get your hands on this book, I would suggest &quot;A Smile in the Mind&quot; published by Phaidon, which includes many bits of work found in &quot;Forget all the rules about graphic design&quot;. However I hope the publisher will do a reprint, because this book should be read by every student of graphic design.	2001-01-13

I really liked his ideas about trying to make presentations in person (because people don't really read proposals). There are some great tips on how to ask the right questions to find out what a potential client is really thinking. Seasoned sales professionals may find some of this advice old hat, but it's never bad to be reminded of some good basic ideas. Khalsa does have a weakness for having silly charts, acronyms and rambles a bit too long - by the end of the book I found myself wanting the author to get more to the point. But if you are new to sales or wouldn't mind a good refresher course this book is pretty useful, but by no means the definitive text on the subject.	2001-01-01

I purchased this book because I saw a great speech by Gore Vidal on C-SPAN, but I was rather let down by this book. Pretty much everything here is dated (the book was edited back in '92) and it hasn't aged well (unless you want insight into the left of the 80's). <br />In less than 100 pages Vidal tackles geo-politics and over 200 years of history - the result is that he goes a mile wide but only an inch deep. It's like reading a transcript of a speech rather than a well reasoned essay. The few interesting nuggets of insight get lost in the process. The same publisher did a series by Noam Chomsky (the Chomsky Trilogy) which is worth your money and deals with the same subject matter. <br />The other problem is that Vidal is so cynical and doesn't spend much time offering up any new ideas. There is a rant about President Polk and the Mexican War - but does want us to give back Texas and California? You'll never find out because a paragraph later he is onto something else. The book oversimplifies complex issues - the result is an intellectual fast food meal that leaves you hungry an hour later.	2000-12-31

By starting out with a simple question about a roll, she goes on a quest and opens a the lost world of pre-Holocaust Poland in the process. Her book takes you to every corner of the world (Poland, France, Israel, Texas, Austalia and of course NYC) in search of a lost world. This is more than abook about bread, and perhaps one of the best history books I have recently - and a great exploration of what it means to be Jewish, and in a bigger sense explores what it means to be human. <br />While it's a short book (I read it in one night) Mimi packs in the details. When you are done reading it you wish you were taking notes. This book would make a great gift, and is worth sharing with your friends and family.	2000-12-30

This book isn't aimed at hardcore academics, but more to students and the rest of us who watch the History Channel. Philip Lawson has taken an objective overview of his subject, which is important because it's easy to focus on the larger issue of colonialism. <br />By reading this mini-epic you will get to trace the history of the company from it's start in the Elizabethan era until it's end in the mid-1800's. The book is packed with a cast of characters ranging from humble bookkeepers to greedy heads of state. There are some nice details about the history of tea and trading (example: I had no idea that it was the English who first put tea and sugar together around the 1680's). <br />Now you may ask yourself why you should read this if you are an American? Well our own history starts off with the Boston tea  party, which was raiding an East India Company ship. More important the books touches on the subject of monopolies, which will be of interest to anyone into modern economics. What's great about this book is that it also serves as a good introduction to other books on the subject, so if you are interested you will know where to start.	2000-12-30

If this book reprented itself as a study of alternative design from '85 to '95 that might be one thing - but it doesn't have enough perspective or go deep enough.	2000-11-30

BUT the book lacks real inspiration - it's very dry stuff. While the volume has many pretty pictures with &quot;case studies&quot; the book doesn't really tell you a story. The work itself is very good, but you can see that in an awards annual like Graphis. You just get the feeling that they didn't have any fun putting this book together. I judge my design books on how often I run to them for inspiration - and this volume doesn't rate too high. I have an ancient book by the founders of Pentagram (Fletcher, Forbes &amp; Gill) which blows these kids out of the water. So this book is a must have for the reference library, but you may want to wait until it's on sale.	2000-11-28

He designed some of the best logos of the 20th century (example: the IBM logo), and this book features some of his best work. Rand doesn't take himself too seriously, and this book has a touch of humor here and there. His genius is that he can pull off a liquor ad, kids book or corporate showcase. My favorite thing about the work is that it doesn't look dated, there is a timeless classic quality here. Rand designed this book himself and the quality shows, this book is a must for anyone who is a professional graphic designer. Sadly Mr. Rand is no longer with us, but we have his treasures in this book.	2000-11-26

The book format uses one line questions followed up with an answer of a paragraph or two. The great thing is that the questions cover EVERY aspect of life in outer space that you can imagine - sleeping, hygene, eating, going to the bathroom, bleeding, clothing and back pain! There is also a great chapter which gives tips on what it takes to get into the space program. Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down!	2000-11-25

Of course THE April Greiman book to own is the out of print &quot;Hybrid Imagery : The Fusion of Technology and Graphic Design&quot; - but if you can't get that classic, then this little gem will have to do. The nice thing about this book is that it covers her work in the 90's, and while the web stuff doesn't shine - her print work and dish sets are damn good. Sadly the book doesn't capture her magic as it's rather on the small side - so you can't see all of that wonderful detail that April has in her work. In the end this book is a good appetizer, but it leaves you wanting a full meal. However it will make a good addition to your personal library, and it would make a nice gift for a creative friend.	2000-11-22

Bogdanovich does a great job with this collection of interviews of great film directors. Not only does the book give you a good inside view of the craft of cinema, but it also acts as a history book of the film industry.<br />This book would be good for the serious indie director who has bet his/her credit cards on their dream or even the special person in your life who stays up until 4am watching the Turner Classic Movie channel.<br />There is something here for everyone as there is a wide range of directors who work in a wide range of styles. There isn't a genre that isn't touched in this book - from Hitchcock on Horror to Chuck Jones on cartoons. What's great is that Bogdanovich captures insight into directors that are no longer with us (like Fritz Lang who directed Metropolis). Since the directors tell their own stories, you don't get the Hollywood hype filter.<br />If you had to buy one book on film this year, this would be it!	2000-11-22

If Paul Rand was the grandfather of American graphic design, then Cipe Pineles is the grandmother! That alone is a great reason to make sure you have a copy of this book in your reference library if you are an art director or just love great editorial design. The writing in the book is great and goes into detail, but the real flaw is that you only get to see tiny thumbnails of her design work. While this gives you a good taste of her style, it leaves you hungry wanting to see more. But until more books are done on Cipe (pronounced See-Pea), this book is a must have.	2000-11-18

Charles and Ray Eames were two of the best industrial designers of the 20th century - but to call them &quot;industrial designers&quot; doesn't capture the range of work that they produced which included everything from architecture to educational movies. While they didn't write this book themselves, the author has managed to capture their spirit on the pages of this little treasure. It's almost as if you had Charles and Ray as your personal design coach. The book makes the assumption that you know something about their work, but even if you don't you can still gain from the advice (and if nothing else it's a great starting point to research their work). While I like to see pictures in a book aimed at designers, the few words speak volumes. The tips have a very zen like quality, for example tip number 2 is &quot;Notice the ordinary.&quot; This book would make a great gift for any creative friend you have, or if you find yourself in a rut!	2000-11-18

Brodovitch is THE Fix	Alexy Brodovitch is one of the best art directors of the 20th Century. This book is worth every penny because it really allows you to see his work in the same scale that he created it at. Thus when you are looking at a magazine spread from the master, you are seeing it full size - and not as a little pretty icon that decorates too many design annuals. In addition there are examples of his raw layouts, which really let you see a genius at work. This book is a must for any fan of graphic design, photography and fashion.	2000-10-14

For those who think that anti-establishmentarianism started with Woodstock or the Punk scene this book is a must read. Christopher Hill shows the roots of the modern left and the populist movement going back to the English Revolution of the 1600's. He shows a variety of different groups that rocked the status of the era, including movements for land reform and quite radical notions about religion. <br />If you want to understand American history, this book is a must read because many of these movements could be seen later in the American Revolutionary war. It may also surprise many that the friendly face you see on a box of Quaker Oats has more in common with counter-culture rather than corporate culture. <br />Hill sticks to his theme and writes well. While filled with footnotes, this book was very easy on the eye. In addition he manages to show how these movements change over time. Never a dull page here!	2000-10-12

This book covers Asia from quite a few unexpected angles, including politics, family and culture. The first thing I liked about it is that it's not a book that gives the idea that the rise of Asia is a bad thing for the United States. Mr. Rower doesn't just focus on China, he hits India and quite a few other important spots. In addition he points out weak points in each economy (example: lack of a bond market), so the book gives a well rounded picture. <br />This book would be great for anyone who just wants to get a better picture of Asia. The only down side is that as it was published in 1995, it has quite a few predictions about what things will be like in five years - shame on the publisher for not doing an updated edition.	2000-10-12

He tells you about JBL by telling you about the world that he came from - and you get to meet the people and places that made the man. His portraits of his father, Lady Bird and Sam Rayburn are touching - and bittersweet. Caro never makes JBL out to be a saint, but he makes a future President very human - and shows what is amazing about America. <br />This book is never a job to read - there isn't a dull page in the entire volume. He brings history to life, so that you feel you know JBL as if you were in his inner circle of friends or family. You can taste the dust of Texas in your mouth.	2000-10-09

If you need to do icon design this book is a must! Horton comes from the  old school where you have to show the most in only a few pixels - and there  is some very smart thinking here to pick up on. This book is great if you  are just starting to learn about interactive design or an old pro looking  for inspiration.	2000-09-03

I stole my copy from a friend and never returned it! This is one of the best reference books for historical graphic design styles. The book is very well organized, and contains quite a few color illustrations. It has given  me hours of inspiration when I have an assignemnt to do for a client. They  have examples of everything from Victorian packaging to Psychedelic poster  art. This book would make an ideal gift for a student just learning the  field, or an old pro that has been around for years.	2000-07-23

As a kid growing up I wasn't so crazy about the modernism that the Eames represented - but as an adult in a post-modern society you can really see their charm and warmth. This books reads like a history of visual design  for the later half of the 20th Century. Charles and Ray did it all -  industrial design, architecture, graphics, film and of course furniture.  Long before multimedia was a buzzword, these two were making magic. I only  wish that the book has some of the more charming details of their lives  (the Smithsonian exhibit actually had their Christmas cards). But all in  all, this is a fantastic read...	2000-07-23

This is one of my favorite graphic design books - and is well worth the price if you can find it. This shows a collection from the early years (late 70's) until the late 80's. Before computer graphics April was playing  with color xeroxing and cutting up photographs. She is one of the true  giants of graphic design - and this book shows you why. She was VERY ahead  of her time - doing graphics with a Mac when it first came out. Like the  giants (Paul Rand) she has the heart of a fine artist - and ranks with the  best of 'em.	2000-03-26
