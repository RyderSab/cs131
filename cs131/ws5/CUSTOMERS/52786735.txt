I love that people think because of Disney and the Brothers Grimm think that fairy tales are for children.   <br />Sorry, Ding thank you for playing. <br />The original tales..Loooong before Disney and the Brothers Grimm were brutal and nasty tales told to adults in most cases. And when they were told to children we are not talking modern children who live in nice safe comfy condos and apartments but children who lived in cottages with wild woods and forests near by. Where the world was totally different place. Where girls became women much sooner than we do today.Read the original Arabian Nights that will show you some of what I mean. <br />Why do I go on about this? Because these anthologies take what was raw and frightening about the orignal tales and attempt to bring that feeling back in the only way modern minds can comprehend. <br />Do they succeed? Not always, but many many of these tale are beautiful. I've collected these antholgies since they began and I love them for the way they do not hold back. Much like the single shot novels that have been coming out by many of these writers they are trying for something new and old in the same pages. <br />Yes Disney is fun but to say these books have destroyed your childhood memories or complain that they wanted their classic tales unsullied..sorry gang, your classic tales are not the originals and honestly when I want the \\"classic\\" versions I read those..why repeat something already done? <br />This book and the other antholigies are brilliant, alive, dark, distrubing and not always successful but when they are they are simply breathtaking!	2005-05-04

Treasuries have been being released for decades now and they have ALWAYS been reprints. There are usually some small differences though like these Treasuryies also have color strips and not just B&W.  If you have never bought a treasury before then it is understandable you would be disapointed but it isn't anything new, they did it with Calvin and Hobbs and the many other strips out there. I usually by both only if they have additional fun stuff in them like the Calvin & Hobbs books where Watterson would do original work just for that book.  Get Fuzzy is great and with the exception of For Better or Worse and the occasional Boondocks this is the only strip that consistantly gives me enjoyment.	2004-10-20

All of these stories are from previous rare Chap books and other small press printings from many many years of Mr. De Lint's body of work.<BR>So some of the stories aren't as well told because well they were written 10-15 years ago.....also this clearly states it is full of SHORT stories..short stories can't go into the kind of detail several folks seem to be demanding from De Lint. If you want more details of some of these characters by the OTHER anthologies of Newford as well as the full length novels. Don't whine and complain because you feel like you got dropped into the middle when the books clearly says it is MORE tales from Newford..not ALL the tales from Newford....sigh.<BR>Beautiful collection lovely lyrical quality and and engaging characters.

Everyone is so real and human it is marvelous to have such a writer and I plan to read more of her books. I can't judge this to any other of her books except Circle. And since I found this book even more wonderful than that I have to disagree, with my limited knowledge, with the reviews who think his book is lacking. If this is lacking then I wish there more writers who wrote at this level!	2003-12-11

Yes it is more of a stand alone novel than a part 3, but really how much was there that needed to be said after book 2? Nothing that I could find, so this is a perfectly decent book with a nice suspenseful plot. It is, however, rushed and a bit sloppy in places.<BR>But my goodness moral depravity? Where on earth did that come from? There is nothing of the sort in this book, there is some pragmatic thoughts by characters because of the stubborness and bad decisions made by others that those characters could not prevent. But nothing to suggest such a term as moral depravity.<BR>To sum up it was a fun book with a nice and interesting plot. But I too would have liked another 50-100 pages of plot for a better ending...not just abruptly stopped as it was.	2003-11-19

But they do have a deep and frightening darkness...Caitlin's enemy, the creature that steals her dreams is a brutal monster and there are some very scary scenes in this book.<BR>But in the end the entire tale is soo engrossing I can't put it down. Sadly many of his more recent books lack that depth, or maybe I'm just older and less inclined to be taken in by them..and yet I can still read this book and other older De Lint and be drawn in as before..... <BR>What De Lint does when he is truly inspired can only be called true magic...if you want that kind fo magic read this, Moonheart and Memory and Dream...but be warned they are not for children nor readers who do not like some truly, deeply, dark evil in their books.	2003-09-03

Even in the real world to be an artist is a magical thing and so much of what De Lint puts in this tale deals with what it is like to really be an artist, I just love it.<BR>It is an amazing story and one of CDL's absolute best..dark and terrifying at points, beautuful and magical in others. This book is brilliant and will always remain one of my favorites...	2003-09-03

Sadly I can see some of the potential but there is so little elaboration and it all ends so quickly. Even most of his short stories read better than this novella.<BR>The whole main plot of the puzzle box is so lacking in detail and the we are only given a glimpse of who brings the box to the plot and then they disapear never to be heard from again. This book SHRIEKS out for another 200 pages of some decent plot development. It almost seems like this was either written by de Lint when he was much younger, or by someone completely different. Of all the de Lint books, this is the only one I did not keep.	2003-09-02

Ever since I was a young girl in school and found Dragonsong in the 1970's.<BR>I really enjoyed this book I love how Anne is filling in the gaps for us about folks from other books like Jayge, Aramina and Readis as well a the Dolphins from Dragonsdawn.<BR>But here is what I think would help folks a lot in their enjoyment of this book and some of the other books.<BR>I think some of these later books don't work as well on their own because they truely aren't stand alone novels like Dragonflight, Dragonquest etc.. You absolutly HAVE to have read Renegades of Pern, All the Weyrs of Pern and Drangonsdawn for this book to make sense to you!<BR>I think it would be a smart decision to integrate this book and possibly some of the other later books into the novels they companion.<BR>Take Dolphins for example: I think the plot would have been better recieved had it been combined with &quot;All the Weyrs&quot;, yes it would have added another subplot but they also could have eliminated all the parellel &quot;All the Weyrs&quot; plot synopsis. And it would have prevented any major errors such as the Lord Holder death issue someone mentions here. I have to check my books at home I don't know if that reveiwer is correct or not.<BR>The timeline jumps around but I have no problem with that it happened in Dragonsdawn and other Pern books so what's the big deal?<BR>In the end I enjoyed this book but I believe it would have been better received as part of the &quot;All the Weyrs&quot; story than a separate novel.	2003-08-01

I've loved the Pern books for over two decades now but I have to say this is the least memorable of the lot. No engaging characters, not much of an interesting plot and a bit recycled.<BR>We've already had several stories of Pern folks not convinced about thread coming back. I understand that this is a different generation, but it just didn't amaze me nor was it given a new and fresh out look on the plot of resistant holders etc.<BR>It was not completly awful however, just not thrilling or a book I will reread as much as the rest of the Pern books.<BR>New readers to the Pern series should note that this is the only book of this generation and doesn't have any lasting story to tell here.

It isn't perfect but I'll point that out later.<BR>I was sceptical when I first read reviews that maybe this wouldn't be as good as her earlier books; so I waited patiently and finally bought it when it was out in paperback. To be blunt I have never consider Mercedes Lackey's book worth buying in hardback unless on sale, her books are simple with classic hero plot tales and lack any really strong depth or character devlopment. That having been said, her books are still some of my favorites and this book is added to the list. I don't buy her books and expect Tolkien, Wurts, Kay or Rawn, I buy her for the fun of classic escapism with good characters that have fun adventures and don't over think or potificate too much. When I want that kind of reading I choose from the list above of excellent writers.<BR>Skif's tale is good one, it was fun to read how he became a thief to read of his friends and aquaintences before becoming a Herald. It is a worthy addition to my large Valdemar Collection and is even above some of the earlier books in the series in its enjoyment.<BR>Here is why it isn't perfect....language usage.<BR>A writer should NEVER write a book using accents that can halt the flow of the story and force the reader out of the world of the novel in order to reread a diffcult sentance of two. And sadly that is what happens quite a few times in this book.<BR>In her efforts to display, in writing, the difference in speech between the Exile's Gate community and the Herald/Upper city folks she resorts to bad abbreviations and odd slang that doesn't read at all smoothly for the average English reader. This is an absoulute taboo according to all my writing professors from college, and I must agree. <BR>You can, with proper narrative and some small bits of slang writing convey the same feeling but not draw the reader out of the novel and force them to reread portions to get the meaning of the conversation.<BR>My last quibble waswith the backward speak of another of ML's older Valdemar characters, Alberich, he sounded like Yoda. I do not recall him ever speaking this way before, certainly not to the degree he does in this book. And since we know her very first Valdemar book Arrows of the Queen happens not too long after this book ends it makes no sense and ends up just being another silly language trick of the author that is unneccessary.<BR>Other than these two faults I found the book quite good, I'm not sure what Hearld rules another reveiwer say were played with, there isn't much in the way of Hearld work in this book as much as in other books as it deals mostly with Skif BEFORE he is Chosen. I think some folks are confused by the comment that is made near the end about Skifs status with the Hearlds, I did not as a reader take this as literal but a mater of how he was accepted, not that he was actually elevated up in ranks....each reader can see it differently.	2003-06-20

As a long time OZ fan it was very odd to read this novel about the truly evil Wicked Witch from the first book. Honestly I almost put this book away a half dozen times.<BR>Why didn't I? because it was also incredibly engrossing I found myself almost facinated to see what he would twist of my beloved childrens books next, and he sure didn't disapoint me.<BR>Glinda is a self centered pretty girl, the Wizard is a despotic dictator destroying OZ, Dorothy is a pawn used to destroy the true hero of this book.<BR>Very odd, very well written, and very disturbing. I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Maguire but I'm not sure if I will ever read the book again. The original OZ books are a delight. But this novel really twists the tale into something quite dark and depressing by the end. Something I'm not sure Mr. Baum's book deserved to have done to it. I do however have tickets to see the musical this May in San Fransico out of perverse curiosity and my profond respect for Stephen Schwartz the composer who made Godspell in the 1970's. If anyone can make me truly care for characters that were once [bad] and hate those who were once good, he can and maybe it will let me read the book again.	2003-04-18

I liked Vanya/Ivan but couldn't abide Sleeping Beauty. The story felt weak and unapealing and IMHO only the scenes with Baba Yaga and her Bear husband were interesting and clever. By the time I was done I felt very disapointed and sad that Card had not done as well with capturing what is so good about the tale. His characters were mostly cardboard stereotypes and inacurate ones at that from what other reviewers have said.

After I read Illusion I found the other books by Paula Volsky to be missing the strength and depth of that book that so engrossed me when I read it. <BR>But now with the Grand Ellipse she has finally done it again!<BR>What I like the most is that in this book not only does she give you some info as to where the land in Illusion has gone but we also read about the countries from Wolf in winter, The White Tribunal etc....<BR>It was lovely to finally see all these lands contected as they have never been contected before.<BR>The characters are engaging and well done, and I feel I could have read another 200 pages of their adventures during the race.<BR>Hurrah for Paula Volsky! Now my hope is she can continue with her next book and not lose her way as she did somewhat with the books that followed Illusion.	2002-10-10

In the age of junk like the very UNfunny Garfield this strip is breath fo fresh air.<br />I believe many reviews were deleted because a group of folks were giving false information as to what happened in these books. I know, I saw them and complained to Amazon.If you dislike Get Fuzzy than tell the truth about why, don't make up stuff that has nothing to do with the book!<br />If people would take the time to actually READ the strips you will see just how intelligent Darby is. No it isn't Doonsbury but then I rarely read Doonsbury and find it only funny some of the time so if you are a Doonsbury fan maybe this strip isn't for you. But then maybe it is, everyone's sense of humor is different.<br />I find this strip wonderful, intelligent, funny and well drawn. Certainly a big improvement over Luann, Cathy, Garfield, Beatle Bailey, Hagar the Horrible and the many other strips that should have retired ages ago!	2002-05-23

Her worlds are fascinating, well developed and original. <BR>I like the way she uses magic and how she is not afraid to use her characters to the best advantage for the story, even if it means killing a beloved main character.<BR>All in all she is a well rounded, clean writer.<BR>One of the things I like the most is that these books, while thick, do not slow down plot-wise. Unlike many authors who can get to tied up in description and really lengthy charcater devlopment for minor characters Melanie stays true to her plot and always ties up her plots by the time she is finished. Not always in the same book but you always get a spectacular finish.<BR>Now if only she would finish book 3!!!!	2002-05-10

Oops! I said his name, oh well.<BR>Do I enjoy reading more &quot;edjucated&quot; writers? Of course, but I also enjoy ML books because they are simpler than those longer, more complex tales.<BR>Vaynel is one of her best characters and his story is all the more tragic because if you have read her first trilogy you know how it will eventualy end.	2002-04-24
US	52786735	R3JAV82D9OBXH4	0812544501	137004441	Tam Lin (Fairy Tale)	Books	5	3	6	N	N	Wonderful	I am a big fan of most of the Fairy Tale series and this one is one of the best, in my opinion.<BR>Some earlier reviewer claims you have to have been an English major to enjoy this book. How sad that this person is so negative to readers in general. It is also a sad testament to todays world that not enough reading is done so that books like this would get reviews like that.<BR>It is a clever and well written novel and there are references throughout to the Tam Lin ballad, but unlike less skilled writers Pamela Dean doesn't come out and hit you on the head with them, YOU have to see them.<BR>Excellently crafted and delightful twists and turns make this a facinating read for ANYONE who enjoys a more complicated tale instead of something with all the clues handed to you on a platter!	2002-04-23

Get Fuzzy is fabulous, Darby Conley has a maturity in his humor that goes beyond your normal strip.<BR>He is aware of the world and he is obviously well read. Just take a look at some of his Get Fuzzy strips and you will see it.<BR>Way to go Darby now lets get more of this stuff out and bring us books with the sunday strips in color!<BR>:-D	2002-04-22

Robin and the other male charaters are not the negative stereotypes she has written before. The descriptions of Sherwood are excellent you can truly see the places and people of this story. And this book is missing the negative men vs. women debate that turned me off of the Tiger and Del series.<BR>I enjoyed it from begining to end. This book also has a sequal which I have yet to read but it is on my list of must reads. I hope it is as enjoyable for me as this one was.	2002-04-18

That is where this series is headed at this point. I only hope RJ pulls it out of that rut by book 10 or I may never read his stuff again!<BR>That is my humble opinion. If you still like it, I am happy for you, but don't tell me I have no right to disagree with you.	2002-04-18

Not because it was forgetable, but because Janny Wurts is so detailed in her craft that her books simply cannot be read once and understood completely.<BR>Janny Wurts truly cares about these characters you can tell by how she depicits them. She shows all their good and bad sides with equal care and skill. No sloppiness or tangents of petty and uninteresting behaviour. Even when a character who was once good, goes bad you can still feel for them and understand why and what led them there. These people are real and yet also not real as they exist in a world where magic is real.<BR>If you enjoy the kind of depth that brings tears to your eyes as well as a well crafted world full of characters of good, bad  and those torn between the two you will enjoy this book and the ones to follow.	2002-04-10

It feels like, as another reviewer put it, that Jordan is just streching this story apart in order to write more books.<BR>I have always enjoyed multiple series books but I have to say I am really bored with this series now and all the main characters are spending so much time bikering and belittling each other it is like some horrible MTV fanatasy themed reality show!<BR>If I wanted that kind of stuff I would hang out at the local High schools.<BR>What disapoints and upsets me the most is that Mr. Jordan is a truly wonderful writer. But his characters have gone from strong and interesting, to petty, childish and completly unsympathetic. I found myself wishing Rand would just kill everyone and start over. I haven't even finsihed this book because I couldn't stand the waspish nature most of the females have developed and the idiotic behaviour of most of the men.<BR>Sigh.....it started out so well.....	2002-04-10

Although it is better than Trader.<BR>I would recomend you find DeLint's older works before you read this. <BR>Books like &quot;Yarrow&quot;, &quot;Moonheart&quot;, &quot;Memory and Dream&quot; and &quot;The Little Country&quot; are excellent begining books that are still in print. <BR>WARNING! DeLint does tend to use graphic language and scenes in many of his books some books are worse than others. He has some fairly horrorific villians very dark and quite cruel so I wouldn't recommend these books for children without you reading it first! He even dabbled in horror for a couple of books written under suddonym. He is very good at writting the darker side of Celtic and Native American mythos and is a fantastic writer	2002-01-14

She makes you truly care for these people and her world is a facinating place full of color and life. I have red this series numerous imes and it never fails to enchant and enthrall me even though I already know what is going to happen.<BR>She creates brillant and strong female characters without being too feminist. When I say that I mean they are strong, independant and smart without making the men out to be weak and stupid. <BR>Just like one of my other favorite writers Anne McCaffery, M. Rawn has a world I could read about for the rest of my life..if only there were more books!	2002-01-14

Get Fuzzy has got to be the funniest strip since Calvin and Hobbes! I love all the characters and Darby's art is excellent for a \\"simple\\" cartoonist. I canot wait to see more of these books.<br />Bucky is hysterically funny in his arrogance and ignorance.<br />And Satchel is just so sweet and innocent..<br />Darby is obviously very intelligent and has a great sense of humor..want proof? Then buy this book!!!!! Maybe that is where some folks get lost, his humor can go past the norm of comic strip humor and maybe some people just can't stand that.<br />You know I was just reading some of the ridculous reviews that have appeared after mine and I'm sure Amazon isn't aware that a large number of people, or possibly just one person, is/are doing false reviews of this book.<br />Whoever keeps talking about Vietnam, Gumby and colon cancer and whatever is completely fabricating their review folks! Those scenarios do not exist in this book!<br />And for those who continue to bash Mr. Conley's work and say it is no Bloom County etc I have to say that Mr. Breathed and  Mr. Waterson have both aknowledged how prior comics have influenced the look and even sometimes the story of their strips. Look at strips like Pogo and Kazenjammer Kids (Sp?). What about Peanuts? IF Darby is copying Bloom County and Cavin and Hobbes aren't they just copying Peanuts with its talking dog and children speaking and acting like adults? Calvin and his constant school problems could almost mirror Pepermint Patty and hers,<br />Get off it folks! All comic strips are influenced in some way by their predacessors, but it takes a rare talent who can make it new. I see nothing plagerisitic in Get Fuzzy, it is just the next generation of humor and it is about time too.<br />Garfield move over, you stopped being funny years ago. Bucky is now in command!	2001-10-26

I previous reviwer complains about the character of The Lord of the Dance that appears. What this woman does not relize is that the Lord of the Dance is an old celtic song about celtic/christian mythos and was meerly used by Mr Flatley as his center piece of music for his show. The character has nothing to do with Flatley or his show but I can understand why people not into celtic music or tradition may assume it is from Flatley's show.<BR>Try these books they are quite good but do not look for a repeat of the movie!	2001-09-20

I was at friends house the other day and she was showing me some picture of her and another friend of ours doing \\"Glam\\" shots. I was stunned when I saw a picture of her that looked just like Clara Bow, silent movies famous IT girl! They had used this book to do it.<br /> The next day I went and bought this book. I was incredibly impressed with it from start to finish.<br /> Now for those who complained that Kevin didn't give name brands and exact color shades to buy, come on you guys! Do you really need to know every single item you should buy? If you need that much instruction these books are not for you! All you need is a a good sense of your own color to use his ideas to your best advantage. Besides Kevin makes it clear that these colors are not going to work on every skin type so you should using his information and enhance it to fit your own skin tones.<br /> I would never wear some of the colors he suggested because I am too pale but I did use his guidlines with colors I already had and my friends had a fit over the change. I've never worn much makeup except to perform but with Kevin's instructions I could enjoy wearing makeup every day and not feel like some painted clown!!!<BR> <BR>This is still one of the best books around for make-up common sense and how-to. Get it because there will be no more books from Mr. Aucoin who tragically died in May of 2002. It is shame that such a gifted, kind and loving person should be gone so soon. I would have bought his books for the rest of my life given the oportunity. His whit and sense of humor is delightful and a joy to read while learning the ins and out of make-up.	2001-08-16
