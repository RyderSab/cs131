I am glad I have my own copy of Come the Spring in hardcover.  It is just so enjoyable.  I am pleased.  The only reason I do not give it a five is there are a couple of predictable moments, but they are enjoyable.	2003-03-25

Maybe if one is familiar with the  area they could better appreciate the heavy description of the land.  I respect the bravery and strength of the woman in the story.  I would have like more about her and less about which path she travelled.  It is graphic in places, but so is war.  I have yet to decide how I feel about the ending.	2002-08-20

I got the most from the sections of the book on early childhood.  I did disagree with many points about early adolesence in the way of handling homosexuality and pornography.   But, what I disagreed with was a small portion of the book.  I was  enlightened by most of the book.  I am a very busy mom.  The writing style  was conducive to my lifestyle.	2000-03-08

It talked in some detail about eating the liver and lung of Snow White.  It ends with a description of the demise of the Queen, &quot;But they had  already put iron slippers over a fire of coals, and they brought them in  with tongs and set them before her.  Then she had to put on the red hot  slippers and dance till she dropped down dead.&quot;  Need I say more?   This is not for small children!  The pictures are beautiful giving the book  a few stars, but there are only pictures on every other spread.  My son  continued to try to turn the page while I was reading the pages with only  words while I am trying to anticipate what to skip over.	2000-02-28

Initially, my 5 year old son was nervous with the graphic pictures of a chopped off tale and blood dripping from it.  Then, when we read the story, he studied  the illustrations, he was terrified!  This from a child that loves  dinosaurs.  I am glad we did not purchase it and had only checked it out at  the library first.  The general story is good, and what talent the artist  has it is just too graphic for little people.	2000-02-28

This book is designed for the busy life of a mom.  It has a verse on one page, and a short story on the next.  I could read a few pages at a time and not feel cheated because of being called away to tie a shoe or change a  diaper.  It is a witty and encouraging.  I had to buy my sister, mother of  six, a copy also.  It is the first book I read begining to end in a very  long time!  I think parents that have children over the age of 3 get the  most from the book.  And, the more children you have, the more you will  love this book.	2000-01-19

It is a family  keepsake.  We have four books on the upper bookshelf to ensure they remain  in perfect condition.  This is one of those four.  I can not say enough how  beautiful the pictures are and how wholesome the story is.  Everyone should  own this book!	2000-01-19
