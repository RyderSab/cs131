I admit that it took me several tries to end it, because I didn't connect to it at all. <br />Surprisingly, all of my friends loved it, and talked about how \\"Cool\\" the book is. Others simply read it as you study for an exam, memorizing.  <br />Knowing that it is a classic, and attracted by its author's alleged mystery and the conspiracy theories related to the book, I was glad to have a chance to read it. <br />However, as I said, it was hard to get through. Holden Coalfield, the main character, didn't appeal to me at all. It was impossible for me to identify with him or to understand him. Salinger's writing didn't help the reading to be any easier, on the contrary. The way the sentences are designed and the general weirdness of the book, made me dislike it. <br />Not so long ago I saw a review of the book in the New York Times that said exactly that, and I was happy to find that someone whose opinion worth stating agrees with me.  <br />As he says there, I don't see \\"The Catcher\\" as universal. I think that it appeals, if at all, only to the American youth, and if others enjoy it, it might be a proof to the place American Culture is getting abroad. I don't think it's brilliant, and it's defiantly not one of the best books I've read.	2005-06-10

It was indeed fun to return to the world and characters that I have like so much in the first book.<br /><br />I can't say I was disappointed, it was a great, fast and flowing reading. I enjoyed the book very much.<br /><br />However, in my opinion it is not as good as the first book. Perhaps because, like any sequel, it is an extension of a good thing that stands for its own right. Perhaps, because I am still young myself, I was able to connect more to the teenaged heroes than to the adult and married ones.<br /><br />However, it was a great joy to meet them all again, and I think it is a good and worthy sequel, although it can't be compared to the first.	2005-06-05

If you'll look down at the trilogy gift set here on Amazon, you'll find, somewhere, a review I wrote of the LOTR series. I claimed there that it's not a very good book, and its true value lies in the breakthru it made.<br /><br />However, I have one escape: I said there that it might be the fault of the transtlation to Hebrew. Some time ago I decided to go to the original English text, thinking that if the original is bad, then it's simply not such a good book.<br /><br />Well, I got a lesson about the importance of a good transtlation. I have read the book from cover to cover, ceaselessly, and enjoyed it greatly.<br /><br />Tolkein's English is superb. You can see he's a linguistic, since his language is deep and reach. The characters are wonderfully built and the plot, although complicated and very detailed, is easy to read and fluent.<br /><br />After reading it in its original language I see the problem. This book is a challenge to every translator, because it is deeply rooted in the English tradition, both plotwise and in its language. It takes a skillful transtlator to pass all the different meanings Tolkein uses, and still have a readable result.<br /><br />So I do recommened anyone who considers to read this book in any other language other than English, to wait until you can handle with its not-too-difficult language. It'll be worth your while.	2005-04-18

As a trilogy, it was fun, light and fast reading. Salvatore's best side, perhaps because of his expirience in script writing, are the battle descriptions. They are indeed very much alive and very detailed. However, this series is nothing more than a nice action film. The characters are shallow, the plot is naive and unoriginal, the attempts to give some meaning or philosophical thought, or to make the reader somehow identify with the characters are weak and get lost because of the shallowness of the plot and characters. The literary tricks and metaphors are odd and clear. Overall, Salvatore cannot make his book be more than a DnD based book. His writing is not good enough to make the books have a literary value of their own. <br /> <br />However, Salvatore did create one of the coolest characters in Fantasy history, one that will be written in the annales of Fantasy next to Gandalf, Bilbo and Frodo and Raistlin Majere. Even though Drizzt is not the deepest character around, it doesn't matter. Like any good action hero, his life are merely a background, just because you can't have a character that comes out of nowhere. What's important about him is what he can do with his hands. For that, and only for that, Drizzt is worth your money and time.	2005-02-12

This book is indeed the best fantasy book I've read lately, and it is second in its quality, in my opinion, only to Weis and Hickman.<br /><br />Martin creates a very realistic and detailed world. It is not surprising, however, since many of its characteristics correspond with our reality. For example The Dotraks are clearly drawn by the lines of the medieval Mongols. He also corresponds with other Fantasy books. The basic idea is well rooted in Fantasy: A seperation between the \\"Good\\" and the \\"Evil\\" worlds that is about to break, the return of an ancient evil, a selected group which is supposed to stop it.<br /><br />Here, however, the similarity ends. This is only the base, on which Martin builds a wonderful tower. His book is much more complicated than any other fantasy book I've ever read (Indeed it might be thought of as a genre in its own right). His world is highly detailed.<br /><br />Masterfuly, Martin creats numerous characters, each and every one of them deep and realistic. He skillfuly manevours between them, without stoping for a moment the reader's interest or understanding.<br /><br />The major difference between this book from most fantasy books is that there is no clear seperation between good and evil. Many of the characters change sides. Other are unaware that their deeds are good or evil. Some can't be determined at all while others are good or bad only when you judge them in comparison to the other characters, but not objectively.<br /><br />I haven't read the rest of the series yet, but this book is pretty much the background. It sets the tools for the rest of the series. It describes the political activities in a kingdom on the verge of war. However, it never fails to show the human side of the involved personals. The reader finds that he can't trust anyone to fulfill his excpectations from it. Characters change as the plot become more complicated. Each has its own interests, but even they change.<br /><br />I have read the 750 pages of the Hebrew version of this book in a week. It's impossible to put it aside. The ending leaves you with eagerness for more, since it stops in the critical moment, where all the tools are set for the great conflict.<br /><br />It is, however, a serious book. I think that the younger readers will have hard time figuring it out. It is also very dark, compared, for example, to the fantasy of Weis and Hickman or R.A Salvatore. If you are not into that kind of books, don't read it. For the rest of you, it will be an introduction with one of the most fascinating worlds in Fantasy literature.week.

The trilogy has everything: Adventure, Friendship, Love. <br />Like most of their books, however, the trliogy is centered around one or two main, deep, characters, wile the others are, although not flat, are less deep. For example, in Dragonlance, the center is Raistlin. In Deathgate cycles, they are Haplo and Alferd. Here, it is the Prince, and, for the first book, Gareth. Once Gareth dies, the series lose something. Perhaps he had to die, and yet, my feeling is that the characters that catch his place are great, but not as good. <br />That is also why I think the first book, \\"Well of Darkness\\" is the best book in the trilogy. It is slow, true, but it explores, deeply, the character of the Prince and of Gareth, and the relationship between them. It is, in my opinion, the deepest book among the three. <br />However, the authors also use their talent to breathe life into each and every one of their characters and make it seems real. The other two books are filled with such characters. However, while the first book took you into the dark well of Dagnarus' soul, the other two books take you into a journey in the physical world. The second book is a travel-book, a quest, which hints seriousely towards \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  <br />The third book combines the two trends. Weis and Hickman use their second-to-none talent of story telling, and make you rise with the dark storm that covers the world you've learned to know. The cause for it is Dagnarus, which you learned to know in the first book. <br />However, I think the third book is the weakest among the three. you read it because you want to know the end of the tale, the fate of the characters you learned to love. However, it seems that somewhere in the middle the authors ran out of ideas. If I were them, I'd put thebook away for a year and just think about it. The many different plot lines are joined in the dramartic ending of the story, but I think it could be better. It's hard to define, but I feel it's less good than the ending of Dragonlance, for example, something is missing, that something that makes you feel sad that the book is over. <br />In addition, the Authors takes their thesis about love that defeats all to a somewhat Bizarre extreme on this series, and sometimes it seems that they wrote something just because they had no better idea. <br />Overall, I loved this books. The minor flaws are indeed minor, and you will read it throughly and willingly without stoping. I still loved the first book the most. Once you've read it, Weis and Hickman, as usual, with their extraordinary writing, leaves you no choice but to keep on reading, and this is their real talent.	2004-12-24

In \\"Warrant for a Genocide\\" Cohn states that the protocols are a creation of the underworld where madman express their ideas, and that sometimes, this ideas arrive to the real world, for the use of the uneducated and ignorant. The problem with the Protocols is that it is looks academic and convincing. The believers attribute it to \\"Professor Nilus\\" and say that it is proven by the fact that it fits the world's events. Well, here are a couple of facts that might help disproof these claims:<br />1. Nilus wasn't a professor. He was a mentaly unstable and probably mentaly ill Russian mystican at the begining of the century, living with his wife and his ex-lover near a monastery in Russia. He only copied the protocoles.<br />2. The protocoles are based on a couple of books, the main one is a book from the 19th century written against Napoleon III, there is a copy of it in Paris' National Library with marked paragraphs that fit exactly to paragraphs in the protocols. There are even language difference: The copied part are in excellent French, while the rest isn't at all.<br />3. It was probably created by the Tzarist Secret Police and we know that the copy they created arrived to Nilus' hands.<br />4. The idea to proof the protocols by examining how they fit the facts is created by Henry Ford, after he crushed into a tree in order to avoid going to court about the protocols. He knew that there is no other way to 'proof' it. By the way, he lost his case and had to apologize.<br />5. The Protocols were proven as a fraud in numerous trials, those in Swissterland and South-Africa in 1934 are pretty well known. In every case, the supporters of the protocols couldn't proof their claim, and their defense was a mishmash of antisemite propoganda of the worst kind (Race, blood, etc.)<br />I know that those who believe in it won't believe me, they'll say i'm Jewish and hiding the truth. It's a pitty that you do, because you learn nothing, you refuse to learn, you refuse to discuss,because deep in your heart you know that it's not your ratio that agrees with the protocols, it's the hatared in your heart. Perhaps, if you'll examine it, you'll see that it's not the Jews you hate, but yourselves. <br />I think Amazon shouldn't sell this stuff.	2004-07-19

First, a warning for the Dragonlance fans: This book isn', at all, like Dragonlance. Dragonlance was a merry, optimistic tale, filled with light and love. Even in the darkest parts of it, and there are many, it's never too dark. That's not the situation here.<BR>Weis and Hickman takes their amazing talent of storytelling into new realms. Their incredible way of building characters in a way that they'll look real, is working great in this book. You find that you are happy when the heroes win and unhappy when they lose. You identify with them. The problem is that the heroes are not the good characters of the book, they are the villians.<br />And so, you find yourself torn between the good characters, which you know a lot about, but they're not the main heroes, and the heroes, which you've accompanied all the way, and feel that you know them, even likes them. In the middle there's the Wheeping-boy, who is torn by exactly the same dilema as you are, and you are always eager to see what he decides to do.<br />All around the characters there is a wonderfully built, amazingly detailed world, and an original, complicated and sophisticated plot, that makes it impossible to lay the book down.	2004-04-19

As a student, when we've learned about the Iraninan constitutional revolution of 1906 things were very simple: an alliance between the Ulamaa, the Bazaar and other people of interest, that created a united front against the shah, in order to create a constitution, a parliament and so on.<br />In this book, Bayat shows that things aren't that simple: She wonderfully paints and intellectual-social-religious profile of Iran before the Revolution. She shows the effect of Western ideas and the different forms it took. She describes the intellectuals and others who had taken part in the leading of the revolution. She writes with detail about the different secret societies that was formed, their tactics and their activities. She shows that the 'United Front' wasn't so united and that things aren't as clear as they may seem in first glance. <br />The book, not on the writer's fault, is very detailed and therefore somewhat confusing, at least for me. It'll take you some time to arrange all the names and organizations, and yet, because of that you grow curios to see how all those people, although they had different ideas and goals, had all united and managed to get what they wanted.<br />In conclusion, it is a book that's offering an interesting thesis and a new point of view on the Iranian Constitutional Revolution.	2004-04-15

It was interesting to learn about his childhood and how he became a wizard, yet, it, it was so much more interesting if it wasn't serve on a silver plate to us. I remember how, before reading this book, I spent a lot of time trying to understand Raistlin and build his background, only from the hints found in the &quot;Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Legends&quot;.

Surprisingly, they're working. True, the ride isn't as smooth and fun, and it's sometimes bumpy, but it's moving. What makes this series a good ride is especially the amazing tallent of story-telling that the authors have. The cahrectres are good, but not as good as the original Dragonlance heroes. The plot is nice, but I prefer the Chronicles, and I liked the old Krynn better.<br />I enjoyed this series, I really did.

In 'Exile' Salvatore had solved some of the problems. He still stick a lot to what seems to be a framework of an already made fantasy world, he still have parts where the writing isn't floating and sometimes using old literary tricks to keep on going, and he might need another spark of imagination or inspiration. Yet, this book is a lot better, a lot more mature and a lot more floating and fun to read than the first one. It seems that after Drizzt's leaving of his city, the book became closer to him, as if he himself had left the coldness and distanceof the Dark Elves. The book is a lot warmer than the first one, and so, leaves you with a better feeling in the end. As I said in my review on 'Homeland' there is something in Salvatore's writing that makes it greater than the sum of all it's parts. In 'Exile' you see it even better than in the previous book, and since it seems that Salvatore is getting over his problems as the series goes on, and becomes better and better, I am truly eager to read the next book.	2003-07-31

I wasn't sure what to think about this book as I finished it, I had to think about it for a while, and here's my conclusion: Salvatore is a good writer, and yet, he doesn't have the talent of, say, Wise And Hickman, that capture you and make you into a part of the book, a book that is far beyond the D&amp;D world it's based of. Salvatore, so it seems, needs the frame of the D&amp;D world, and he sometimes sticks to it too much, and it is too clear that he does. The book doesn't let you enter, it's cold and faraway like the world it's describing. If made on purpose, it's pure literal geniusy, and I give Salvatore all the credit, if not made on purpose, well, it's still good. Yet, it makes this book harder to swallow.<BR>Maybe it's the transtlation, but sometimes the book seem to be stretching things too much, until it begins to bore, and sometimes there is some imaturity in Salvatore's writing that makes you almost role your eyes.<BR>However, the Characters are great, the plot is original and good, and beyond all the lacks in the structural-literal part of the book, you finish it and love it. There is something beyond the plot, the dialogues, the characters and the plane literal espect, that makes this book a great book. 5 stars, and worth each of them.	2003-07-18

I haven't read the entire book yet, only a chapter (no. 4 I think) that was published in a newspaper here. Yet, based on what I've read, I'd like to make a comment.<br />I am a student for studies of Islam and Middle East in Israel. One of the first things we learned is that Islam has many faces. If you want to have a fanatic, Anti democracy, that supports a physical Jihad, you could find the support for it in the Qura'an, but you could also find the exact opposite. Islam have the seeds of goodness and democracy in it, you just need to let it grow.<br />I find Fallaci's approach somewhat Orientalist. (In the way Edward Said reffers to it. I don't agree with all the things he says in his book, \\"Orientalism\\", yet, it fits here.) She is talking about Islam in general, without, in what I've read, deffering between different schools-Suna and Shia'a, different approaches or even different areas of the Muslim world. Her view upon Islam in general is based only on the fanatic sides of it, that she had met.<br />About the culture in Islam, or should I say The lack of culture she claims it has, I disagree. Art, History, Literature, Philosophy, Medicine and sciences had developed in the Muslim world and effected the Western culture. Besides, one of the worst things one can do is to judge a culture in the terms of his own culture.<br />I am going to buy and read this book. Just for curiosity. May I remind you, though, that this is not a scientific book, it is a book written by a woman that had met only the fanatic sides of Islam, whose motivation to write this book was the most shocking act of terror ever. Remember that this book is written in anger, that it is very emotional and that she is not a researcher, it is not an objective and scientifically proven book, for that, you need more perspective than that we have on the 9/11 events.<br />If this book is a warning, so be it. I will take it to my attention and try to keep my eyes open. Yet, as an Israelian, who sufferes from terror and fear on a daily basis, here's an advice to all the readers of this book and the likes of it: Don't let the pain, anger and hatard blind you. If you'll be blind to the good sides of Islam, you will think that there is no choice but to open a war, and would do nothing to prevent it. Always hope for peace, even when your mind screams: 'God, we should just bomb them all off the planet', and most of all never, ever forget that Muslim, Christian of Jewish, White, Black, Yellow or Red, we are all humans. We all have fathers mothers that loves us, and children that we would rather die before seeing them suffer, we all feel sadness, happiness and pain, and we all, most of all, want to live and have a right to live our life in peace and happiness. May God, Jesus, Allah, Buddha, or whoever that is sitting up there will bring the peace to this world soon.terror and fear on a daily basis, here's an advice to all the readers of this book and the likes of it: Don't let the pain, anger and hatard blind you.

It was the first time that I've opened a musician's autobiography, and I thought it might have an examination of how he developed his style, how did he decide to play the instrument, etc. This book was a good surprise. Mingus is hardly focusing the music, though it is always there, and choosing to tell us about everything that's around it. It seems as if he knows that the reader is probably familiar with his music, and is trying to make us understand WHY his music is as it is, and it's a smart move. The autobiography sort of completes the music, adding a missing half to it, making me understand Mingus the man, and through it understand better Mingus the artist.<br />The book is written wonderfully, Mingus' writing is brilliant, and the story sweeps you with him and you thank God for it being such a small book or you might've missing a month from reading it rather than a day. Some things are not totally clear, and some things are not explained, but yet, it is a great book, deals with love, crime, blacks and whites, jazz, madness, and the conclusion, which is expressed in the title, that love, for friends, women or for music is the only thing that's really important, and if you dig it, you could find happiness.	2003-03-29

I have just finished reading the &quot;Chronicles&quot; for the 100,000 time in my life (I'm reading it over and over again since I was in the 3rd grade. i'm 19 years old), and I still found myself wiping a tear. Visiting Krynn again, and meeting all my old friends: Tas, Raistlin, Caramon, Tanis and the rest of the gang is always great, and I love these books more and more as I get older. <br />&quot;Dragons Of Spring Dawning&quot; is in my opinion the darkest book in this 3 books series (I don't consider the 4th as a part of the chronicles, in my opinion it ruins the perfection of the other 3). All the conflicts that are only hinted in the other 2 books are floating into the surface, and creats one of the most facsinating plots ever written. We discover darker sides of the characters that we fell in love with, and in the end, it only makes, me at least, love them even more. <br />I ended this book, again, and I almost cried. For some reason, the goodbye was harder this time. I found myself wishing, in somewhat childish and naive way, that I was really there, in Krynn, not only visiting, peeping through the keyhole of a book, but actually there. This is, I believe, the sign of a truly great book (Or books, in this case, the Legends are also highly recommended) I know that it is not my last visit to Krynn and not the last time I meet my favorite party. I hope, if you've never been there, to meet you there too.	2003-01-02

King is leaving his regular style of dealing with para-normal phenomenon, and start dealing with the most normal, and yet most para-normal thing: the Human soul. More than it is a horror book, it is a thriller, and a very good one. You feel the sweat dripping down your neck and your breathe getting faster when the hero is in tension and fear (and there are many moments like this.). This is a story about a situation that we wouldn't like to find ourselves in, and that's why I personally symphatyzed the hero, it is the story of the human soul in its struggle to survive and in the depthes of madness.	2002-08-25

The formula that is given in this book has become an important formula in socialogy, and can be found easily in other books. Yet, this book is one of those books that should be more avalible, since it contains a lot more than just this formula. This book was one of the most important book in my graduation-project and the fact that I couldn't read all of it, but only a couple of chapters, and the fact that I couldn't find it anywhere made me feel that I missed important information (My project, spread over 140 pages, got a 100, by the way). This book is very well written, and is understandable even for people with no background in socialogy or psychology.

As an Israelian I had special interest in this book, and I really liked it. The plot is thrilling and fun to read and the book is very well written. Yet, the most important thing about this book is, in my opinion, that it reflects the reality in the middle-east: A cycle of old hates and old revenges. No one can remember who started it, and it doesn't really matters. There are no bad guys or good guys because the whole concept of justice doesn't exist anymore. Everybody knows they are angry about something, that they are revenging something, however, does it really matters? Does it right? Does anyone really remember why it all started? This book is recommended as a good thriller and a thought provoking book.	2002-08-24

Not reading it truly means a hole in the education. It might seem a bit old-fashioned to the \\"MTV-Generation\\" (Which I personally a part of.) but yet, it is a very interesting book. The thing that I remember the most, from the first and last time I read it in the 3rd or 4th grade, is the food. In a world where submarines are a regular part of our lives, there was nothing unique for me in the idea of a sub. Yet, the food facsinated me, they were eating things that I've never heard of, and they seemed so exotic, that I still remember them: The sea Cucamber, the squid, the sea-weed, the fruites of the bread-tree. I think that this book is a great gift for your child. However, buy it for him or her when they are still very young, before they are 'corrupted' by the TV and the idea that reading is \\"not-Cool\\". This book would also make, in my opinion, a great bed-time story for a kid that is old enough to understand complex and sometimes scary storylines, and yet young enough to be charmed by the wonders of technoogy and nature, and sit with mouth and eyes wide open when the giant squid is catching the Nautilus.	2002-08-16

Don't let the title mistake you, this book had kept me on my toes, and gave me goosebumps. However, King can do a lot better. The charecters in this book are really shallow and not really interesting, unlike the deep and complex charecters that King can build with his master hands. The plot is pretty good. The idea of using articles about UFOs in the begining was cool, and fits to the time of the writing of the book, when the UFOmania spread around the world. However, the plot is sometimes silly, and the horror is \\"Freddie Kruger\\" style. King is focusing in groosom, blood and disgusting things, rather than his usual psychological terror, like the one in \\"Pet Sematary\\" for example.  On the other hand, we must remember that King was passing an uneasy time when he wrote this book, and I guess it has effected him. It is a nice book, but he can do better.	2002-08-13

However I would like to comment something related to the reviews here: Most of the reviews that I saw had praised this book as objective and well-reserched. Some, however claimed that it is pro-Israeli biased. Well, not everything that has pro-Israeli facts in it, is biased, just like not anything that has pro-Palestinian facts in it is biased. An excellent review on Benny Morris's &quot;The Birth of the Palestinian refugee problem 1947-49&quot; had proven that there is another book (The great &quot;Fabricating Israeli History&quot; by Prof. Efraim Karsh) that doubts and cancels some conclusions and facts in the book, by proofing it wrong using documentation.<br />I will agree such a disproof of facts, and accept it, but as long as a certain fact is well-prooved, documented and agreed by historians, I don't see any reason to say it is biased, because it is a fact. A book CAN be biased or effected by propoganda, but if yoy want to proof that it is biased, bring facts that proof that the information in it is wrong.	2002-08-12

In case you wonder why you need to fish out a book from 1970, well, it's because this book is one of a kind. I think Yigal Allon is not a very famous chrecter in the outside world, not as Moshe Dayan or David Ben Gurion. But if he doesn't it is not because he didn't do anything important, but because his natural modesty covered on his great actions.<br />He was a briliant strategist, and yet a peace-lover who talked with the Arabs, understood them that was the first to offer a peace-plan with the Palestinians, back in 1968.<br />Yigal Allon was jewish, and was borned is Palestine. He witnessed the creation and development of the Jewish defence, andwhen his time arrived, he took a part in it. He was a member of the respond forces that attacked the Arab bases in respons to their attacks on Jewish settlements. He was the commander of the Palmah, the Hagana's elite unit. In the1948 war he commanded \\"Yiphtah\\" operation at the Galilee, and when he was turned to the commander of the southern front, his strategy and briliant tactics had beaten the strong Egyptian army. In 1967 he was offered to be the minister of defence, but refused, and yet was a part of the security counsol and an advisor to the prime minister in security and defence manners.<br />He wrote many other books, but the most important, in my opinion, is his first, \\"A curtain of Sand\\" from 1948 (Written during and after the war, was upgraded after the 1967 war.) where Allon is analysing Israel's strategist situation and actually designing its army.<br />So, as you can see, by buying this book you don't buy \\"Another book about the Israeli Army\\" you buy a book written by a man who was one of the main creators of it, and that just because of his foreseeing the future and the needs of the state of Israel, the Israeli army is as it is today.	2002-08-06

In his regular modesty that is uncommon among diplomats or Generals (And he was both.), especially in their autobiographies, Allon is not bragging in his great deeds, he isn't even placing himself in the center of the book, but he is telling us his own story, through his father's story. He is telling us about why he had become the person that he is, the person that had done all the great things that doesn't appear in the book. This book is giving a personal and very interesting point of view on the life in the pre-Israel Palestine told by a Jewish person who was born there, but more important, this book is reminding us that even the greatest people once had Fathers.

He is dealing with the &quot;Here and Now&quot;, and not any far away blury future. His books are always dealing with things that are on the edge of science, and most scientist ignore: Aliens, Time-Travel, Extra-Smart Animals, Clonning, Brain-Control experiments and so on. However, even though they are on the edge of the science, on the border between real and fiction, they are still a part of our everyday scientific discussion. What makes such book important is that they bring to the mind of the people another way of using things, that one day would become a part of the scientific &quot;Main Stream&quot; (Like clonning is today.), and it's warning the public that there is always the possibility of bad use in the scientific power. The science, in its ever-on struggle to discover, would tell us the benefits of a given discovery, but not the bad things, and that's what Koontz is doing.<br />As it comes to this book, it is a truly great book. Nazies are always a great subject to write about, and Koontz is making the most original use thatI've ever seen in this subject. It is an interesting, thrilling and fun book.	2002-08-04

They might also hold a certain opinion, and in order to proof it, they ignore certain documents that doesn't fit their thesis. Biased books can be called &quot;Historically incorrect&quot; but they do not lie. Ignoring documentation, though, if made with full awarnace, is, in my opinion, wrong because it is deliverly mistaking the reader. However, that's not a lie too, it's just a struggle to proof a wrong idea.<br />I believe that in every history book there is a core of true and correct facts. It might be covered with half-truthes, rumors, biased opinions and lacking documentaion, but some basic core is still factually correct. Our job as readers or scolars is to find this core and by using it build the most objective and unbiased model of history. In order to do that we need to read books from the radical-left to the fanatic-right. We need to compare every book to what we know and what we've learned from other books. By doing that, and using alimination, we could try and find this core of truth, or at least build a research-based opinion on a given subject.<br />As it comes to &quot;The New Historians&quot; I believe Prof. Karsh (author of &quot;Fabricating Israeli History&quot;) when he says they ignored certain facts. However, their is a core of facts in their books: There were cases when Israelies were involved in things that we can't be proud about, i'm sure we did, there are spots in the history of every country in the world. <br />However, these things, if happened, were isolated cases, not a part of a master plan to expel Plestinians. I believe the major part of the Palestinian runaway was self-planned, driven by the natural fear of a civilian population from combat, the Dir-Yassin fight/massacare and the rumors about the cruelity of the Jews. The faith in the sterngth of the Arbain armies, and the belief that they could return when the war will end in the victory of the Arabs, make it easier for them to leave.<br />Another problem in writing the history of the Israeli-Arab conflict, a problem that Morris himself admits, is the fact that it is almost impossible to get any documentaion from the Arabian side, and as a result it is impossible to know what was the Arabian stand about the refugee problem, and what was their part in its creation.<br />In Addition, in the 1980, when this book was written and published, there was a phenomenon of breaking mythes in the Israeli soceity, known as &quot;The Trumpeldor syndrom&quot;, maybe we can see this book, and others, as a part of this phenomenon.<br />I believe that the motivation of the New Historians, as a part of the 'Trumpeldor Syndrom' is &quot;A joy for other man's troubles, motivated by a Provocative tendency to amaze and annoy&quot; (Taken from &quot;(Criticism on) Roman Russi&quot;-by Meir Shalev&quot;, in &quot;Zionism and Sabarism in the Israeli Romance&quot; by Yosef Oren). <br />This book shouldn't be read solely. It is crying foR compartion with other history books. This book does not give a full review on the creating of the Palestinian refugee problem asit claims to give. However, it gives an interesting point of view.<br />I think this book is important as a  representer of a certain opinion, and as a history book with a core of truth, that can, and should be used by the historians of the future, along with many other books, to understand what really happened in the 1948 war.	2002-08-03

It was great. This books kept me in tension to the very last page, and it is, surely the scariest book I've ever read.<br />However, it is also an important book. The kids are not the usual kind of heros, they are nerds and outsiders, ... More than it is a book about a monster that is killing people it is a story about the power of friendship, the power of dreaming and of love.

Many scientific books are hard to read because while whatever is written in them is clear to the writer, usually a doctor or a professor, it is far beyond the understanding of the average reader. Most of the science books start high, they will explain you anything about black holes, assuming you know what a black hole is. They could tell you about the wonders of galaxies that are thousainds of miles away, assuming of course you can understand what they are saying without checking every second word in the dictionary.<br />&quot;Broca's Brain&quot; is the exact opposite. Instead of starting high, and force the reader to climb up to the book's level, Sagan is starting in the low and simple things (A grain of salt, for example.) and takes the fascinated reader to the high and miraculous.<br />Sagan is a great teacher, and more than that, he is a great storyteller. He is teaching science as it should be taught: As a story. Without funky formulas that most people can't even understand, and in simple and clear words. He is telling us the story of ourselves and everything that's around us, and in this book he is turning science from a magical and isolated thing to what it really should be: Simple, understandable by everyone, interesting and basically fun.	2002-07-29

The plot is amazing, the charectors are great and it is as scary as a good book by Stephen King should be. But more than anything, it is a warning. this book, written before AIDS was a well known disease, King is describing the possibilty of a plague that is killing most of the humanity, a doom's day version of the 1918 flu. And the worst thing is that this virus is men-made. <br />From the terror, groups of survivors that are immune to the virus, start to regroup.  Some are choosing the way of good, others the way of evil. As in any of King's book, there are many supernatural things in it, but I think they are less important.<br />Like the story of the Easter Island this book warns us. It warns us to make sure that whatever demons we are messing with in science, we must keep them locked. It warns us that the crazy armor race that is going on, might one day do what it's meant to do and destroy us. It warns us that our uncontroled scientific and technological development might turn against us, and it reminds us how small we are actually, in the end of the day, when the lights burn out and all that's left from our science is the same primitive life form that we were 15,000 years ago.<br />And yet, it is a message of hope. It shows the greatness of the human soul, and the human ability to survive against all chances. And it shows us that mother nature, after all, is the best scientist.	2002-07-29

The plot is boring, and the first 100 pages are so boring that I can't really understand how someone can get through them. I personaly believe that a big part of its sucsses, at least from what I saw in Israel, is publicity and commercials. Half a year before it arrived to Israel there were commercials to it anywhere. If you bought a book, it said on the bag: \\"Have you read Harry Potter yet?\\", and there were signs about it anywhere. I even saw an interview with a critisizer that praised the book, and then mistakebly admitted that she didn't read it.<br />I can't really understand what is all the excitment around this book.

I have known and loved it long before \\"Dragons of Summer's Flame\\" arrived to Israel, and I was very excited when \\"Sumer's Flame\\" arrived. I bought it, and prepeared myself to a sleepless night of jumping into my favorite world. As I read I felt my excitment turn into a bitter disappointment. The book is connected to the other 6 (Chronicles and Legends) only by charectors and name. The plot is a lot under the normal \\"Dragonlance\\" standard, and it's sad that it's under the same title as the chronicles, because it's only pulling it down. Sometimes 3 is just enough.	2002-07-23

One of the things that always disturbed me in the \\"Dragonlance Chronicles\\" was the riddle of the relationship between Raistlin and Caramon. I even wrote Margaret Weis asking her if Raistlin had ever loved his brother. Well, in this thrilling, funny, exiciting and breathetaking book, I have found the answer, at least my answer. I refer to this book as the last in the \\"Tanis and his friends\\" Saga, because I didn't really like \\"Dragons of Summer's Flame\\" and it is indeed a great ending to an amazing saga. A must read, and if you are a dragonlance-o-holic like myself, a must have.	2002-07-23

His geniusee is that he's wrapping this naive or even childish idea with scientific ideas and very realistic terrors. The charecters in this book are great, the book is scary and yet fun, and is a great way to pass a summer's night, or better, a stormy winter night!	2002-07-23

When you come to read this book, you can't ignore its reputation as &quot;The Best Fantasy Book&quot;. However, I disagree. The idea is great, but the book is too long and have many exhausting parts, it is not a fun and floating reading, and I often found myself forcing me to keep on reading, just because of the Reputation. It's a must in every bookshelf, but i'm affraid that it'll stay unmoved on my private bookshelf. It is the first, and for that it disorves its honor, but it is surely not the best.	2002-07-03

It does not mean it's not a good book. It is a great and fun thriller, but the amazing charecters of &quot;Fear Nothing&quot; disorve more than that. This book is a great way to pass a cold and stormy winter night, like most of Koontz's books, but it doesn't have the great scientific logic that makes Koontz's books so realistic. Nice, but Koontz can do better.	2002-07-03

The Dragonlance Chronicles is the BEST fantasy series I've ever read. I first read it when I was really young, and I was so amazed, that I read it in one night. Since then i'm reading it again every once in a while, and it's never boring. It worth every penny you might pay, and a lot more, and a must not only for fantasy lovers, but everybody who likes adventure, thrill and a good laugh.	2002-07-03
