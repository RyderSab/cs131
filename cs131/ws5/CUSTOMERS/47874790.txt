No more bindings to snap or break or trying to hold a book open to a page while you examine a card.  This is a spiral bound book with the wiring enclosed into the hardbound cover.  The sections are tabbed, the cards' images are just lovely.  The information, while not extremely thorough is certainly more than many starter books give on each card.  <BR>I am so impressed with this book, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning tarot, who teaches it or has friends who are interested.	2002-07-23

Each card is assigned it's own page and assignments on learning it.  <br />Learning the meanings of each card and commiting them to memory is not a simple process and the manner in which Juliet walks readers through, makes it so easy.<br />There are guided lessons and meditations for each card to help you learn how to picture the meaning of the card.  For instance, The Fool card lesson asks the reader to picture themselves inside of a cave, emerging into the sun light and onto a path.  There the reader is asked to imagine they have met the Fool and held a conversation with the fool.  You are encouraged to write in the book and record your thoughts and conversation which this card.  When you break a lesson on each card down into this fashion like Juliet does, it certainly makes it easier to recall the cards' meaning later in a deal.<br />She also offers a step by step guide through a few of the basic spreads and I really feel makes it simple enough that any layperson could comprehend the methods.	2002-02-21

But this book does so much more than that.  His book details in depth interpretations by each sign and planet within each house and gets beyond the basic rhetoric one finds in many modern books.  I constantly find that I am drawn to this book (published 1901) and many other &quot;old&quot; books regarding astrology and tarot, as they aren't simplified or dummied down for anyone.  The words may be antiquated, but the education offered is indepth and priceless.	2002-02-06

If you have studied or are studying his teachings regarding Thoth, this is a must have.  Thoth tarot is rather deep and involved, it works with the Kabbalah and many of the same principles outlined by the Golden Dawn.

A simplified interpretation for each card in specific situations.  However, she didn't stick with simplified interps.  Nancy moves on to very specific interpretations for each card in a given situation and I don't find that they are accurate.  Her specific breakdowns on the areas regarding each card I find bothersome as well, as she doesn't define what position the card is in or what the reading was regarding and so forth.<BR>If your reading deals with disappointment and you draw THE LOVERS, this means your business plan or project will fail and you can't fix it.  How often do we as readers get individuals who want readings because they have no disappointment?  However this interp certainly does not apply all of the time.<BR>I found it a fairly decent reference if you are just learning the tarot and want to verify you are on the right track, but don't hold it as being truth.  Nancy doesn't allow for reversed or negative deals and spends no time differentiating the meanings when they are dealt in specific spreads.	2002-02-05

Yet another of the few books I make certain to have within arms reach of my desk when I am working.  Though only the major aspects are explained, I don't personally work enough with the minors to find that a problem.  The explanations are detailed and throrough. Mr. Pelletier covers the opposition, conjunction, trine, square and sextile aspects.  The only fault I found is that it isn't terribly user friendly.  They aspects are divided up by aspect instead of planet and you must remember to go to the first planet instead of the later.  (ie. Mars trined Uranus is under Trines>Mars to Uranus) If you ever plan to interpret a chart, this is one of those must haves.	2002-02-05

I read it, but didn't read it.  I got from it that it was daddy's fault that I failed this or that, or so and so dumped me, or that I couldn't do this or that.<BR>I found this book years later, shortly after my father died and I was going through some of my old belongings stashed at his house.  It was the perfect time for it to re-surface, and for the first time I actually read the book.  <BR>The only complaint I have regarding this book is emphasis on the &quot;bad&quot; father figures.  The ones that aren't home or are drunks or abusive etc.  But then again, many are, so perhaps it is fitting.<BR>At either rate, if you have ever had problems with your father figure, this book is a must have for not only putting the past where it belongs, but also resolving any issues left in the open.	2002-02-05

This is firstly, I should state, the only book I have come across that focuses at all on the MC, and for that, Ms. Clement should be praised.  I have always found the MC to be highly relevant in an individual's chart and most books barely even touch on its significance.<BR>Ms. Clement seems to apply her own ideas as to what each placement means, and I am not sure at all that some of them are correct.  While there are always opportunities for new applications and certainly should not be thwarted or discouraged, I would like to at least be offered her reasoning on some of the interpretations she offered.  <BR>The bulk of this book is charts and birth datas for an individual to refer to while learning.  I found that to be extremely beneficial, as you can erect the chart and work your way through the learning process.  <BR>Midheaven is so much more than just the tenth house cusp and work ethics and so forth, it really is the deeper side of our own individual selves.  I think that the reader should use this book to learn more about the MC's importance, but as far as interpretations, if it sounds incorrect, verifiy it with one of the &quot;Planets in&quot; books.	2002-02-05

This is every astrologer or wanna-be astrologer's must have!  I keep it right next to my Devore Encyclopedia on my desk.  Written in almost a dictionary-esque format, this book gives the reader simple and informative answers to every possible word associated with astrology.

This book certainly encourages the midpoint disbelievers to give it a chance. I was left disappointed though, as there is never any answer given to the why it works and I don't find midpoints to be astrologically based. <BR>Perhaps it is my bias though that made me unwilling to give this book a higher score. The author spends a great deal of time explaining how to do composite charts and explaining the placements found in a composite chart. I didn't like how he never explained why it works or its significance or at very least, its purpose.	2002-02-05

The book falls apart rather easily, so be careful not to snap the binding by opening it too far.  The definitions are extremely simplified, so if you are looking for an in depth meaning to any of the cards, look elsewhere.  However, I use astrology and tarot together and found this to be my handy dandy reference guide when my memory fails me on a card's parallel.  It's rather small, can fit nicely into a purse or bag of goodies.	2002-02-05

A friend recommended this workbook, and the companion book to read, and I believe this was the most influencial in my healing and also the cheapest therapy of it all.<BR>I was 16 when I first entered therapy for the abuse and got this book.  At the time, there were events mentioned in the book that I hadn't yet encountered.  Now, as a mother of two with a divorce and second marriage under my belt, I find myself flipping through and still working on pages in this book today, over a decade later.<BR>Every time I work with clients who share that they have went through similar experiences, I always recommend this book.  It certainly isn't a replacement for therapy, but there are things therapy can't prepare you for that this work book can walk you through.<BR>I also suggest that you take this book to your support group, conselours, close friends and family, etc., and ask them to sign it.  Much like a yearbook.  It is so encouraging when you feel alone and hurting, that all these people care and love you and support you.	2002-02-05

I have found in the past, that when one reads a book by a doctor, that they tend to use \\"big\\" words to prove they are educated enough to hold a degree.<BR>Dr. Rosengarten, however, does not.  <BR>Each card is explained in full details but not so much as a card, but as a possibility for growth and needs.

I believe this is a very helpful method when teaching astrology to beginners.<BR>If you can find this book, I would suggest holding on to it.	2002-02-02

This book explains the relationships between familys, even when they aren't blood familys.  I erected an astrological family tree for my biological family as well as my adopted family.  It was so interesting to see how I played a role in both families and how we all worked together astrologically.<BR>I recommend this book for anyone who has ever said to themselves &quot;How did I ever survive my childhood with us all being so different?&quot;	2002-02-02

I really enjoyed the section on balancing your nodes.<br />I had the opportunity to meet and listen to Donna last year and can't wait til Astro Rama this year.<br />Tia	2002-02-02

But late at night when the insomnia and restlessness sets in, I grab books.  <BR>So I grabbed this &quot;booklet&quot;.  This booklet is actually a fountain of knowledge.  Okay so you won't walk away knowing everything about Lilith, like I had hoped I would, but I actually found it very useful.  Kelley details Lilith's history in myth and astronomically, focuses on Lilith as she travels through the constellations and gives rather indepth definitions to each placement. <BR>I was thoroughly impressed and would have to say this is a great buy for the price, despite the fact it looks simple on the outside.  :)<br />Tia Starr	2002-02-02

Okay so she is a little harsh on each sign but Virgo but this is a great book for a lighter look at astrology and the zodiac.

Books	5	6	11	N	N	Very Own Personal Jesus	As I am currently working on a thesis that follows along the same lines of this book, I purchased The Jesus Mysteries to see how off base I am or am not.  I have been working on my thesis/book for about two years, paralleling the similarities between Greco-Roman Mythology and Christianity.  When I began my project, I had not been able to find any books that spoke my thoughts and skeptisms.  In fact, during the last year I had began to think perhaps I was truly losing it and that maybe I was entirely off base with my ideas. This book has made me realize I am not the only one who thinks in this manner and that the idea of Christianity being a farse is entirely conceivable. My husband, who is a born-again Christian saw the book and began reading through it and actually started verifying the sources used by Mr. Freke and Mr. Gandy.  He came to wake me up one morning after reading it for hours to inform me how he had came across even more falacies in the Bible.   It has given us both a new drive to work on my project as well as questioning our faith.  It is very motivating to question what has been handed down for centuries.  It's like your very own personal search for the Holy Grail.   We both still believe the ideals behind the teachings of the Bible, but hold no faith in it being Jesus who introduced these ideals.	2001-02-07

After several years on AOL, I have come to realize that they do not make anything simple or easy.  I thought I knew on the in's and out's of shortcuts and tricks on AOL but I was mistaken.  The authors did a great job of compiling every question members have ever asked and answers that actually explain themselves.  Rather than simply telling the reader this is how to achieve this goal, they walk you through each process.  I also have the quick reference for work and I wish I had about forty copies for each of our salesmen who all seem to be computer illiterate.  lol	2000-09-30

I found this book to be condesending to the reader, though perhaps the author meant this to be comical.  I did not find the humour and felt as though he was attempting to talk down to the reader rather than simplify astrology. Overall this is an extremely generalized book and not very helpful for anyone who really wants to seriously study astrology.  I did not even feel that this would make a good reference book.	2000-09-30

I was exceedingly pleased with the cards and they are still my favourite today.   The cards are all baed on deities from ancient mythology, one of my favourite subjects.  This makes it actually easier to read with them because I know the story line and the characteristics of the gods and goddesses depicted on the cards.  rather than having to flip through the book to find the meaning of the eight of pentacles, it was much easier for me to learn and memorize so the book is now non-existant when I am reading. Whenever people inform me they are wanting to purchase tarot cards, I always recommend this deck.	2000-09-29

I don't think I would be exxagerating to state that well over 75% of the people I read for just want to unload and get some type of counseling.   I found this book to be helpful in gaining more skills and knowledge in these areas.  Granted, it didn't seem to teach me anything new in astrology, but I do feel I gained a wealth 0f knowledge when I look at how it has helped me look for key signs and know how to react in certain situations during readings.	2000-09-26

Mr. Louis has a niche for writing technical jargon in a non-complex manner, but without having the basics down, the reader will most likely feel like a fish out of water.   Horary astrology is much more complex and I feel forced to argue the title of &quot;plain and simple&quot; as I did not find anything simple at all about horary astrology.  I must admit though, that Mr. Louis made it seem less like a whole new learning practise and more like the extension of astrology that it should be.	2000-09-25

It is about four inches tall at best, about three inches wide and maybe two inches thick.  It is great for carrying with you to work or on the subway to read. I also like how the authors have listed the common characterisitcs for kids, adults, males, females, parents, bosses, co-workers, employees...whoever you may come across in life.  If you know a persons sun sign or even just a birthdate, you will find not onl a generalized decription of them, but also how they will tend to act and react in situations.  Also, how to get them to bend.  Now I wouldn't call it a must have, but it sure is a nice reference and ice breaker.  I keep it with me at work and it never fails to catch someone's eye.	2000-09-25

Though it is out of print, I cannot urge those who are interested in astrology enough to find it somehow.  Written before the 1950's and well before the term new-age was a term, this book provides facts about astrology and terms.  You will not find anything biased or generalized in this book.  I could not have found a better book for any price, much less a dime.	2000-09-25
