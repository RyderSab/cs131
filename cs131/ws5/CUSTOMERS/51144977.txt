David Kirk's illustrations are vivid and consume the whole page with color.  His text is poetic (eg, termites tunnel underneath very vivid violets).  I have only two small criticisms:<br />1.  The alphabet letters are highly stylized.  Very young children may have difficulty recognizing them because of the extra curlicues and whatnot.<br />2.  My copy of this book had two W and X pages, but no Y and Z page.  Obviously I'd like my children to learn the last two letters of the alphabet as well as the first 24.<br />Because of David Kirk's beautiful style, however, I still read this to my children several times a day.  They love Miss Spider and the world of tiny bugs she inhabits.	2003-05-11

When Guido sees Holly in an art gallery he narrates his observations about her to Vincent.  &quot;Notice how the nose tilts,&quot; he says, and later, &quot;Notice the arc of the arm.&quot;<br />&quot;Notice the feeblemindedness that passes for wit among aging graduate students,&quot; she replies, thus setting into motion a story full of wonderful zingy dialogue as pessimists pair up with optimists and love ensues.<br />Published originally in 1978, _Happy All the Time_ paints both of the primary women in bold colors.  Misty is a linguist, frighteningly intelligent, and determined not to let Vincent's optimism capsize her ship.  Holly is self-contained and self-determined, making her own decisions without consultation with Guido, whose great passion for her leaves him in a perpetual state of befuddlement.  The book is indicative of the era it's placed in, as women behave in ways which have not been modelled for them, and the men adjust their expectations accordingly.  From a feminist point of view, that makes this book an interesting read.<br />From an escapist's point of view, this book is highly entertaining, light but not too fluffy, and thoroughly enjoyable.  I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys Nora Ephron movies, Bridget Jones-type books, and satisfying endings.	2003-03-21

With great wit and satirism, Barry has painted a futuristic world in which capitalizm is the primary force of society to the extent that every individual takes the last name of the institution with which they are affiliated.  Thus, characters like John Nike collide with Billy NRA and Jennifer Government in a high speed suspenseful plot.<br />The plot moves along quickly, although Barry does rely a bit too heavily on the \\"small world\\" phenomenon.  Characters involved in different subplots know each other and it all smashes together in some fairly violent scenes.  The pace of the book is definitely plot-driven, and Barry sacrifices some character development to make his points about capitalism and the death of the individual.<br />That said, this is a very funny book and an entertaining read, if a little on the fluffy side.	2003-02-23

Fleur is everything a reader looks for in a character:  brave, resourceful, honest, and as other-focused as her parents are self-focused.<br />A first novel for Hollywood-raised writer Diane Leslie, Fleur De Leighs Life of crime is an absorbing and memorable read.  Set in the 1950s McCarthy-era Hollywood, it offers an illuminating perspective on our own present-day culture and the roots thereof.  Truly a wonderful reading experience.	2003-02-21

On par with (perhaps even superior to) the Darkover series by Marion Zimmer Bradley, A Game of Thrones is set in a world built 360 degrees out from whatever you're reading on the page.  The writing skills of George R. R. Martin are superlative:  even his minor characters are distinct.  And his plotting skill is more than impressive, making this book a thrilling page turner as well as a satisfying fantasy read.<br />The one complaint I have is that even after 800 pages it ended too soon.  You know how once in a decade you read something that puts you in a world that you don't want to leave?  Well, this is that once in a decade read.  I can't wait to get to the rest of this series!	2003-02-14

Though Liz and her roommates audition for a lark (each of them has an altruistic reason to want the big bucks), when all three of them are cast trouble is ahead.  A bigger brouhaha may be coming when Liz and fellow contestant Jack begin to find each other irresistibly attractive.<br />The real nugget of gold amidst all these dreams of winning is Carroll's sense of humor.  Though the novel is an insubstantial read, Carroll thoroughly enjoys manipulating the peccadilloes of the English language.  She is unable to restrain herself from giving Liz, an ad copywriter, ludicrous products with equally ridiculous names for which to create ad campaigns.  Bars and restaurants have playful names as well. Carroll writes with a light and even hand, creating a book that's easy to pick up, laugh-out-loud funny, and quick to read.	2003-01-23

Set in a familiar Washington D.C. atmosphere of politics and sexuality, this is the story of a First Lady accused of assassinating the President of the United States of America in a marital dispute.<br />Beth MacMann (or \\"Lady BethMac\\" as the press has dubbed her) has called on Boyce Baylor, a defense lawyer as famous for his outrageous antics in the courtroom as he is for winning cases.  He, however, just may lose this one to get even with Beth, who dumped him way-back-when in law school to marry the Man Who Would Be President.  Rounding out the cast of characters is Babette Van Anka, famous actress/singer and Presidential consort, who was one of the last people to see him alive.<br />Buckley has written a fast-paced novel which sends up both the media and the courtroom in this circus of a trial.  Though thinly-veiled references to real personalities seem a little mean spirited (e.g., \\"Greta Van Botox,\\" a cable news personality), for the most part Buckley sticks to satirizing the institutions and societal values which make such a mockery of justice.  Suspenseful, funny and truly an entertaining book.	2003-01-16

The three relationships which Kafka-Gibbons highlights in his ever-shifting vignettes are between a much-older man and a younger woman; two men who tussle with parenthood and the difficulties thereof; and a wealthy, organized woman and the disorganized muddle of a boyfriend with whom she has become pregnant.  The situations are painted realistically, yet both poignantly and humorously.  Kafka-Gibbons's real strength, however, is in his pleasure with both argument and words, which playfully shine through the story and sometimes overshadow it.<br />One of the characters, for example, has a rare neurological condition, which causes her to utter malapropisms.  This results in some funny moments.  One of the through-lines of the story is the circle of reasoning around whether homosexuals should be allowed to marry.  A judge and two clerks are preparing for a hearing in federal court; the judge's two gay sons naturally discuss the case, and everyone has an opinion, which must be explored through pages and pages of conversation about the issue.<br />Sometimes the cleverness of the words and the argument seem to take up too much of the story, but the dialogue is always realistic (if uber-intelligent) and Kafka-Gibbons just barely reigns in the urge to proselytize.  The result is a story that is light and readable, yet challenges the reader to think.	2003-01-02

His main character, Talcott Garland, is a professor of law and a second generation upper-middle class black man.  As such, he is positioned to reflect on society from a point of view not often seen in literature.  As the novel progresses, racism, classism, political viewpoint and a quest to live one's religious principles are explored as Garland seeks to resolve a chain of events brought about by the sudden death of The Judge, his father.<br />Characters, while well-rounded and viable, are seen through Garland's miasma of depression and misanthropy, and are not very likable.  Garland himself lacks some vital element that makes a main character sympathetic.  Although I felt sorry for him, I never really identified with him, and thus couldn't bring myself to sustain my interest in his fate over the course of the entire book.  Though this could be described as a murder mystery, at over 600 pages it is much more profound than that.  At times, the profundity threatened the movement of the plot.  Often Garland had figured things out way ahead of the reader, so that important plot elements were revealed only in retrospect.<br />While it's evident that Carter is a brilliant strategist, for me, reading The Emperor of Ocean Park was like playing chess with a world-class player--I was too many moves behind and found the experience (while illuminating) more frustrating than entertaining.	2002-12-06

They decide to focus on Quentins, a restaurant which is a Dublin institution and has been around for ages.  A present-day plot line about one of those three characters meshes with vignettes of the past.  As a novel, however, Quentins lacks some of the character that the documentary might have had.  Although one gets a glimpse of the old Ireland and the new in the vignettes, something is missing.<br />Quentins is one of those Maeve Binchy novels composed of vignettes, short stories, and pieces one suspects may be the most attractive leftovers of previous books.  Although sweet and deliciously escapist, the book as a whole doesn't hang together very well.  Still, Binchy fans will love reading more about characters they've met in Tara Road and Scarlet Feathers.  Particularly amusing is the reappearance of the twins from Scarlet Feathers and their everlasting and almost-certain-to-embarrass questions.<br />Quentins has a lot of good and poignant moments.  Binchy is at her best at capturing the daily lives of ordinary people.  As a single overarching story, however, the sweetness threatens to overshadow anything more lasting.  Unlike many of Binchy's earlier works, Quentins is a read quickly consumed and easily forgotten.	2002-11-27

Nothing fancy, but sometimes the simplest, most easy to use things, are very valuable.	2002-11-27

Although this book contains more prurient sex and more gory violence than I prefer in a novel, instead of putting it down in disgust, I couldn't stop reading. This is testament to Greg Iles very strong plotting skills, as the  tension in Mortal Fear never abated.  It is also testament to his even stronger characterizations.<br />The characters in this book are real and smart and likeable, even if any one of them could be the one who is killing off women from EROS, an online erotic discussion service and taking a surgical momento from each victim.  Harper Cole, the Systems Operator who connects the killings and comes forward, is ensconced in the turmoil surrounding his very Southern family.  They include his physician wife Drewe, who has a great deal of hostility towards EROS; his ex-cover model sister in law Erin and her surgeon husband Patrick, whose marriage difficulties are spinning out of control; and a father-in-law with friends in high places who makes Jesse Helms look like a liberal crusader for civil rights and racial relations.  With his friend and fellow SysOp Myles, whose brilliance is unparrelleled in Harper's experience, there are plenty of suspects for the serial killings.  Iles's writing is very intelligent and always at least three steps ahead of the reader.<br />This book sucked away three days of my life, which is my way of saying:  read it!  Although there is little socially redeeming value in this novel, it's a very smart thriller and intensely escapist.	2002-11-24

But at 16, when she and her aunt move to a Midwestern small town to run the diner there, her carefully-constructed detachment is challenged when she meets the owner.  G.T. has a way of drawing people in, whether they be the townsfolk he wants to get votes from, or the new waitress he wants to befriend.  For Hope, this is a first:  a friend who cares more about other people than he does his own health, even if he does have leukemia.<br />Joan Bauer deserves the distinction this book has won as a Newbury Honor Book.  Hope Was Here is a warm and friendly read, completely engaging and hard to put down, and I felt good about the world after I read it.  It gets my highest recommendation for any teen or adult who likes Sandra Bullock movies or Maeve Binchy novels or who is curious about the other side of the counter.	2002-11-18

This is the story of Dave, a musician in a wedding band in the New Jersey of the 1980's, and how his life changes as he approaches his own wedding to Julie.  He has been dating Julie for fifteen years \\"on and off\\", and once he's proposed his problem becomes not so much unrequited love as love too much requited.  Though Dave is seen by his band-mates as rock steady and by himself as an all-around nice guy, the approaching wedding looms ahead like the end of his freedom and challenges him to make some unusual choices in his last summer as a single man.<br />Aside from Dave, the other characters in the band each have their own story arc, well-painted by Tom Perrotta.  Though I didn't find The Wishbones as funny as Perrotta's later novel Joe College, there was something poignant and almost naïve about it that was missing in the other work.  A definite must-read for those who came of age in the 80's.	2002-11-08

Amidst these intrigues, American missionaries Emily, Matthew and Zephaniah are hosted by Genji, the last lord of the Okanashi clan, reknowned for their great gifts of prophecy and foresight.<br />Takashi Matsuokas Cloud of Sparrows is unique and unforgettable: in fact, I dont think Ive ever read anything quite like it.  Matsuoka provides genuine insight into feudal Japanese culture and more importantly, allows us to see our own culture through the eyes of others.  The Americans are very much The Outsiders in this novel, and their actions become almost as foreign to the reader as they are to the Japanese.  A wonderful read.	2002-11-08

In an interview with an ambitious local journalist, he mentions the Del Payton case, a racial murder that has remained unsolved for thirty years.<br />Suddenly Cage finds himself in the midst of a storm of racial tensions, crime and political intrigue in which all the major suspects are playing The Quiet Game, a game of waiting to see who breaks first.<br />Greg Iles has done a wonderful job writing a book that is hard to put down.  Not only is it well-plotted, but the characters are likable and the setting is well-established.  The swamps of Natchez yield not only old grudges, but new insights about race relations as Cage works to bring the murderer to justice.  Definitely a 5-star read.	2002-10-24

In Dan Brown's Deception Point an amazing discovery above the Arctic Circle awaits verification by Rachel Sexton.  Rachel is the best person to verify this discovery for the President:  not only is she on his staff (as a low-level analyst for the NRO) but she is also the daughter of his most dangerous political opponent in the upcoming election.  This gives her the perfect status as a skeptic to join the team of civilian scientists in the verification of this NASA find.<br />Within hours, however, the lives of the team are in jeopardy as they discover that not everything is as it initially appears.  Thought the factions of the NRO, NASA, Senator Sexton's office and the White House are far away in Washington, someone has set into motion a series of events which makes it unlikely Rachel will escape the Arctic Circle alive.  In the background of the story is Rachel's estranged relationship with her father and a budding attraction to Michael Tolland, a celebrity oceanographer on the order of Jaques Cousteau.<br />Deception Point is the kind of flawless page-turner that can keep you up far past your bedtime.  I lost an entire night of sleep just trying to keep up with the plot twists.  When a hapless geologist is pushed out of a helicopter by nameless thugs on page 2, you know you're in for something exciting.  This story of political intrigue and survivalism continually turns the reader's expectations upside-down.  It is escapist literature at its finest.	2002-10-24

I got this book as a gift when I was in my twenties, and it changed my whole view of the world.  Since then, I have given multiple copies to other people as gifts.<br />Paul Williams wrote Das Energi originally in the early '70's as a series of journal notes.  The collection of thoughts soon developed an underground following for its insight, challenge to the dominant paradigms of truth, and breezy me-decade prose.  Beauty, God, fear, truth, money, good, evil--these are just some of the topics dealt with in this browsable amalgamation of brief paragraphs and good humor.<br />Paraphrasing one thought from the book:  you don't grow just from getting up and getting another beer from the refrigerator; you grow when you do things you don't know if you can do.  This particular thought stuck with me and has come back to inspire me to face what is difficult from time to time.<br />Definitely worth your time...one of the few books that I keep in my permanent collection!	2002-10-23

It is a domestic novel in the most literal sense of the phrase:  most of the scenes take place around the McSwain's kitchen table.  Caroline McSwain, age 62, is happily married to her husband Tom and enjoys her job as a dance studio owner and instructor and her role as a mother of four grown children.<br />Though there is a constant low level of chaos in her life due to the renovation work being down on their home, the chaos level jumps at the beginning of the book when two tearful phone calls come at the same time.  The first is from her daughter Kay, who has just become engaged to Trey Bennett (of The Bennets, who own the local hospital and bank).  The second is from her sister Taffy, who is in need of comfort and a place to flee her philandering husband.  Though Caroline and Taffy have never gotten along well, Caroline invites Taffy to come stay for an indefinite period of time.<br />How Caroline dances the ever thought-provoking exchanges with her sister while keeping the home fires burning for her adult children makes for an entertaining tap dance of a read.  Jeanne Ray makes the sixth decade of live seem vital and full of humor and possibility, while also capturing the depth of the sister relationship.  This was a wonderful book to read, and I look forward to Eat Cake, which will be published in May of 2003.	2002-10-19

If Edgar Allen Poe were a junior faculty member in a highly political department, this might be the kind of collection he'd write.

Sixteen, hardworking, and alert to the wisdom of the women around her, Tallie has an interior life that stands in sharp relief to the hot, dusty Eden roads she bikes, the trailer home she keeps clean, and the Klip'N'Kurl where she sweeps up hair.  Though the novel is set in 1992, flashbacks to events in 1988 provide insight into Tallie's drive to escape Eden and discover her mother's secrets.<br />Anne D. Leclaire writes beautifully, capturing both Tallie's naivety and her resolve.  At the end of each chapter is a page from Tallie's Book, a notebook with bits of advice in it like: people are full of surprises, and women with fat faces shouldn't wear bangs. Though the idiomatic language provides some humor, parts of the story are sad, and quite painful to read.  Leclaire creates other unforgettable women in this book:  Martha Lee, Mama's best friend whose face is ugly enough to stop a truck; Raylene, who teaches Tallie about generosity of spirit; Lenora, who can read the future in your shampoo suds.  The men in this book are not as memorable.  There's the quietly drunken father, the popular guy Tallie likes, and the not-so-popular guy who likes her.  Though they are needed for plot, the men here fade next to the vivid world of the town's women.  The only other flaw in the book is that the ending is not very well grounded in the rest of the story.  Leclaire's prose is strong enough that she can still carry it off.<br />As the story progresses, items in the notebook change gradually from other people's truisms to Tallie's own truths (\\"It is a mighty and terrible possibility that a person can do great harm without the least intention\\").  How she comes to learn these truths makes an absorbing story.  A good read, but keep the tissues handy.	2002-10-13

Joe College is a novel about a guy from Jersey who is a student at Yale in the early '80's.  Just from the scenario you know the potential for humor and class conflict is great--and Tom Perrotta (author of Election) doesn't disappoint.<br />This is a very funny story, made all the funnier for its grounding in reality.  While Joe College is not strictly an autobiographical novel, it is worth noting that Perrotta was himself a student at Yale who graduated in the early '80's.  IT shows in his writing.  The setting is very realistically portrayed--you can almost smell the '80's, with its leather bomber jackets and Reaganite overtones.  You find yourself really pulling for Danny as he struggles with Middlemarch and his overpriveleged classmates while still dealing with his world back home, including his father's lunch truck business being overrun by mafioso types, and a big-haired high-hoped girlfriend with only a high school education.<br />I chuckled a lot while reading this book, but also recognized myself in it.  I highly recommend it.	2002-10-12

Spanning six decades, the story focuses primarily on Mother Dorothy's family and their closest neighbors in Elmwood Springs, Missouri.  The first decade, the 1940's, covers almost half the novel.  From there, the decades begin to speed past until the 1990's, giving the reader a very lifelike perspective on the phenomenon of time passing ever more quickly the older you get.  In spite of the humor, I found that slightly depressing compared to the fullness of the first half of the book.<br />The characters in this book are unforgettable.  There's Mother Dorothy, who has a half-hour homemaker's radio show every day for almost forty years.  There's her husband Doc, the philosophical pharmacist and keeper of town secrets and their children, the ever-popular Anna Lee and the irrepressible Bobby.  Their hired man Jimmy and Betty Raye Oatman (who is fleeing her gospel-singing family), Mother Smith, Princess Mary Margaret (the dog) and canaries round out the household.  Town characters such as Poor Tot Whooten and Norma's Aunt Elner make for funny reading. Fans of Fannie Flagg will recognize some characters from Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!<br />The book takes on a Forrest Gumpish tone as it goes along and various characters run for government positions and hang out with Elvis and get congratulatory telegrams from President Truman.  The latter half of the 20th century is treated with a deft hand and events are meaningful only as they touch the folks of this insular Missouri town.	2002-10-11

Marie Brown is a too-tall half-deaf woman who hasn't spoken with her brother Michael in fifteen years.  And Marie Brown is an aficionado of quantum mechanics who has been writing her philosophy of science paper for over a decade.  How Marie centers her uncentered life makes for interesting reading in Jenny McPhee's The Center of Things, a unique novel about anthropocentric applications of theoretical science.<br />The chapters are arranged by topic:  time, truth, beauty, jealousy, etc.  Movie quotes, scientific theories, Marie's conversations with Marco Trentadue, Freelance Intellectual, and the plot itself all serve to explore the topic.  Throughout the book, Marie develops her career-breaking tabloid scandal.  The juxtaposition of her shallow aim with the depth of her approach demonstrates the potential of popular culture to capture real human experience.<br />There are some weak spots in this book.  In some places the story becomes subsumed by its devices.  Readers with not much science background will need to take it slowly to understand large portions of Marie and Marco's dialogue.  Readers with lots of science background may find the anthropomorphizing of theoretical physics preposterous rather than whimsical.  And in some places Marie almost gets lost as the dialogue takes over, but those spots make for the most fascinating reading.<br />To say that this book is unusual doesn't quite do it justice.  This is a book to linger over, and read tidbits of aloud. It is a wonderful postmodern novel.	2002-10-06

Unlike many books not geared specifically to men, it presents information in a concise, direct way without a great deal of context.  For this reason it is much less annoying than a great number of other pregnancy/parenthood books.<br />I bought this book for my partner, but ended up using it a lot myself.  Organized by month, the book presents a lot of information that some of my other books didn't.  In the fourth month Armin A. Brott discusses temperament, presenting a table of nine temperamental traits that babies are born with and the indicators of those traits.  The balance between work and family is given a lot more page space than in other books, and money issues as a possible stressor is discussed as well.<br />Brott could have expanded some of his topics.  I'd like the book to have been longer and more complete.  Some topics are barely introduced and then dropped before they are fully addressed.  But like parents, no parenting book is perfect.  I recommend this book for new parents of all genders.	2002-10-06

Everyone pitches in the hard-earned shillings to try to make ends meet:  her father Paddy is one of the dockworkers, her brother Charlie earns a little on the side by boxing at night, her mother Kate takes in laundry, and Fiona herself comes home caked in tea dust from a packing factory six days a week.  She holds back only enough to add to her savings with her childhood sweetheart Joe, in hopes that they might one day own a shop.<br />Through the middle of the family runs the current of an eminent dockworker's union and over them looms the shadow of the Whitechapel Murderer, known also as Jack the Ripper.  When a series of tragedies strike Fiona's family, she is forced to flee to America to try her own grit in the landscape of the great unknown.<br />Jennifer Donnelly is a wonderful story-teller.  The prose is detailed and specific enough to make the story real, but doesn't do anything fancy to get in the way of the characters.  The Tea Rose is a completely absorbing read.  Part thriller, part history, part romance, it is cut not only from the cloth of great drama, but from the fabric of human truth.  Not to be missed!	2002-10-04

Part thriller, part history, and part romance, Red, White and Blue is the story of two people investigating an anti-semitic terrorist group in Wyoming.  Charlie Blair, a Special Agent for the FBI, is described as the product of what would happen if the Statue of Liberty and Uncle Sam had a one-night stand.  He personifies the American West:  he is independent, has strong character and integrity, and one could see him facing down a gunslinger in a dusty street of an old western town.  Lauren Miller, however, personifies the East.  She is a tough journalist for the Jewish News in New York, and the bombing of a video store in the Midwest could be her big story.<br />How Lauren and Charlie come together to break a group of white supremicists comprises most of the plot. Interestingly enough, however, they share a great-great-grandmother in common.  Susan Isaacs spends a great deal of time showing how they became American by tracing the story of the generations between Dora Schottland, a 15 year old orphan from Budapest, and Charlie and Lauren.<br />Though there would seem to be a schism between the historical section and the mystery/romance, Susan Isaacs smooths over the transitions with a narrative voice strong in irony and humor.  Her use of detail to quickly paint the portraits of people in the past is masterful.  While not destined to be a classic, Red White and Blue could still be said to be a great American novel.  Definitely worth the read.	2002-10-03

It was started in 1899 by the women of the two towns in an effort to get the menfolk of each town talking to each other.<br /> As this book opens, it is the beginning of the 1949 season, and girls on both teams are preparing for the big 50th annual game.  New on the Bear Creek Ridge team is Aki, a Japanese-American girl whose family has just returned from the concentration camp where they lived during WWII.  New to the Barlow team is Shazam, who lost her father when Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941.  The very first line of the book, \\"Now that it's over, we are telling,\\" sets up the expectation of something catastrophic happening and that tension is well maintained throughout the book as the girls on each team share bits and pieces of what happened at the Big Game.<br />Bat 6 was a worthwhile read exploring themes of racial tension, rivalry, and the effect of war on the mind of a child.  However, it was difficult going.  In spite of chapter headings it was hard to keep track of who was narrating and what team they were on.  In fact it took me four chapters just to realize that these girls were on different teams, so I had to backtrack in my reading and pay more attention to chapter headings.  A table is provided at the beginning of the book which lists each girl on each team, but to have to flip back and refer to it every time the narrator's voice changes interrupts the reading experience and makes a book like this work rather than fun.<br />This may be a good read-aloud, but it would be an unusual 9-12 year old who would be able to keep track of the story.	2002-10-02

Other parenting books may tell you how to have a happy and healthy pregnancy, how to care for a newborn, and may give you first aid information you could use in an emergency, he says.  In his book, though, you get to read about how tired he is plus there are some entertaining anecdotes about baby waste.<br />The book itself is painfully funny, perfectly capturing the sleepless nights and bewilderment of new parenthood. In the chapter called &quot;Things to Worry About&quot; Reiser lists all the myriad worries that come along when you bring a new baby home, for example that you could make him wave to someone who doesn't wave back, thus traumatizing him for life.  In the chapter &quot;I've Never Been This Tired, Ever&quot; Reiser states that he'd do twenty years of diaper changes if you could guarantee him a solid eight hours of sleep a night for those twenty years.  Not only do these phenomena have an effect on you as a parent, but also as a member of a couple, and Reiser perfectly describes the decimation a baby can wreak on a heretofore healthy relationship.<br />I read this book when my first child was two months old and literally laughed until tears rolled down my cheeks.  I re-read it recently now that my oldest is 2 and I have another infant, and I find it just as apt.  If you're a parent, don't miss it.	2002-10-02

Sarah, age 11, is not weeping, but thinking.  Readers are treated to her philosophical point of view throughout her growing up years as she helps her family cope with their grief, assists in the raising of her younger brother, and struggles to resolve the question of whether to pursue her gift in painting or music.<br />I first read this book as a child and have re-read my tattered copy every two or three years since.  In flavor, it is not unlike \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" as Sarah is the one her family leans on, and yet she has a strong pull toward a life of her own.  Truly an excellent and unforgettable book.  Sarah was first published in 1949.  I'm delighted it's being published again so it may find a new audience.	2002-10-01

It has all the stuff Crusie fans love--lots humor, good sex, food, art, snappy dialogue, likable characters & good friendships.  But it also has something that we've seen Crusie move toward in her latest two novels--a strong plot.  This book would make an excellent movie.

He's suffering the loss of his wife and young son and trying to parent his precocious 12-year-old daughter.  His suffering has led him into the world of living dangerously while attempting to bring to justice the murderer of a cab driver and the person who set a bomb at his wife's agent's art gallery.  This sounds like a set up for an excellent story, but Jim Fusilli has written Closing Time with such a heavy hand as to render it mediocre.<br />Author Jim Fusilli uses dialogue as a method of advancing the plot.  Though the dialogue is fast-paced, sometimes it is so cryptic and so crucial to a plot-turn that it must be re-read three or four times.  This occurs more frequently toward the end of the novel, when Terry is running around New York tying up all the lose ends of the crimes he's solving.  Some of the dialogue caused me to stop and look stuff up.  Example:  Terry borrows money from his daughter and says he'll return it with interest at prime and \\"with the vig.\\"<br />Also, Fusilli writes inconsistent dialogue.  Example:  on page 3, Terry writes to his dead wife \\"it matters not what anyone else thinks or says.\\"  He thinks of a desk sergeant as \\"sloe-eyed\\" on page 39.  But on the same page, he's talking like a gumshoe:  \\"He was here and your guys went at it easy.\\"  Classic noir P.I. language vies with more poetic turns of phrase throughout the book, for an effect that is decidedly off-key.<br />The prose is also cluttered with too many music references.  For example, on page 46, Fusilli mentions that the Tilt-A-Whirl has the best jukebox in New York and then includes a footnote referring the reader to a list of what the jukebox was actually stocked with.  Interesting detail, but it didn't add anything to the story.<br />There are good things about this book.  I loved Orr's daughter Bella, who is 12 going on 30 (but still realistically drawn as 12).  Although the book as a whole lacks fluidity, some scenes flow very well.  Fusilli is good at setting the scene and making the reader really see the New  York neighborhood where Orr lives.  The book also has heart and in spite of Orr's inconsistencies there is something likable about him.  It's just not enough to make up for the sour notes that are struck once every few pages.

Davis.  For the most part, Davis's characters are women trapped and betrayed by either their bodies or men or both.<br />In \\"Only Ends\\" Sissy is a 14-year-old whose best friend is 9 and whose Grandma tells her she's lucky that because of her bad brain she won't have to worry about men.  In \\"Some Things Collide\\" Nadine is a woman alone with breast cancer. In \\"The One Thing God'll Give You\\" Hula's Momma warns her that \\"there ain't but one kind of man\\" and that is borne out by what happens when Hula starts dating Willie. Most of these stories are domestic tragedies, as depressing as a fat-fingered man with a wet toupee and a pinky ring drinking sugared iced tea and Jack Daniels while hitting on the 13-year-old next door. But they are also beautifully written.<br />Although the events of the story are as heart-wrenching as the events in the other stories, \\"Tammy Imagined\\" breaks from the pack in that it is written from a point in the future that implies hope. By its placement in the collection, \\"Tammy Imagined\\" highlights the complexity and dignity of the characters in previous stories.  The collection as a whole is poignant and unforgettable.<br />Like Southern women writers before her, Davis writes colorfully with great attention to the telling detail.  Her Kind of Want would fit in well on the shelf next to anything by Bobbie Ann Mason.	2002-09-26

In the last three months, I've read everything he's published:  laughed my you-know-what off at Straight Man, read Empire Falls through tears, enjoyed Nobody's Fool and scratched my head through The Whore's Child.  That's the context for me saying this about Russo:  Risk Pool is not his best.<br />It's still worthwhile reading.  Set in Mohawk Falls, Risk Pool is the story of a boy growing up into a man and trying to shake off the charismatic shadow of his shady father.  More of a novel of ill manners than a novel of manners, Risk Pool is still reminiscent of those long English novels of the 18th and 19th centuries.  It's funny, and the characters of this town are real and memorable.<br />What bothered me about Risk Pool is that it seemed like two separate books.  The first two thirds of the book is about Ned Hall's growing up years, and the last third is what happens after he leaves college to come back and witness his father's decline.  I really enjoyed the first part of the book, which really captured the universal experience of being a powerless child buffeted about by events created by not-too-healthy adults.  The last third, when Ned is a not-too-healthy adult himself, was more of a reading chore.  I finished the book because I loved the child Ned had been, but the last third of the book could really have been written about another person altogether.  If Russo was going to take us from the moment-to-moment attention he gave to Ned's childhood to this slapdash adulthood, I would have liked to read more about Ned's college years and what was formative there.	2002-09-22

I finished this story in record time because I couldn't put it down.<br />What caught and held my attention, though, wasn't the humor.  It was the realism with which Keyes portrayed Rachel's journey from denial to acceptance of her drug addiction. The novel is set partly in The Cloisters, a treatment center reputed to harbor and rehabilitate some of the world's most glamourous celebrities.  Rachel arrives with valium in her suitcase expecting massages and seaweed wraps, and her bumpy trip towards clean living makes for entertaining as well as informative reading. I don't think I've ever read such a realistic treatment story, detailing the often-humourous ins and outs of an in-patient facility.<br />The story speeds along a little too quickly after Rachel gets out of treatment, racing through the next year in the last twenty percent of the book.  But in general, I was impressed by Marian Keyes's grasp of the recovery process--and I'm already impressed with her story-telling.  Reading Rachel's Holiday was a nice mini-vacation in itself.	2002-09-14

Every story in this collection turns on some unexpected event, point of view, or premise, and about the only thing you can count on is that you will be surprised.<br />While not great literature, A Twist in the Tale does provide some entertaining reading.  Though the characters are largely forgettable, Archer's narrative voice provides you with just enough distance that you can enjoy what happens to them and how it happens (Not The Real Thing, Just Good Friends).  Some of these stories are reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe (A Perfect Murder, Colonel Bullfrog).<br />In short, entertaining reading.  The kind of book you might pick up at a ski lodge and be able to finish in one sitting.	2002-09-08

The prose is clunky and inelegant, and if the story wasn't so powerful, this would be a book to skim through and toss.  But the story is powerful.<br />Malika Oufkir was adopted by the King of Morocco as a companion to his daughter when she was 5.  She lived among the palace harem, in an almost indescribably elegant setting and had the benefit of a private education, tutored by the Princess's own tutor.  When she was a teenager, however, all that ended.  Her father, General Oufkir, was executed for attempting to assassinate the King.  Malika, along with her mother and her five brothers and sisters, was sent into exile.  As the world forgot about them, they faded further and further from view.  Each time they were transferred, they had to make do with ever shabbier treatment and conditions.  By the time they escaped, they had been locked in solitary cells and been fed on scraps of rotten vegetables...and then they were recaptured.<br />Transcribed just two years after Malika was able to leave Morocco for France, Stolen Lives reeks with the power of her anger.  At times, though, the anger got in the way of the story she is trying to tell.  Michele Fitoussi, the Tunisian-French journalist who wrote Malika's story, did a mediocre job of editing, highlighting the outrage rather than Malika's family's extraordinary resilience.	2002-09-07

Thumb sucking, whiskey drinking, fly fishing, toke smoking and bible thumping play a big part in this story which is less about coming of age, and more about resisting coming of age.  Walter Kirn's prose is clear and interesting and the Midwestern setting vivid.  But his characterization of Justin is inconsistent.  I found it very difficult to understand what motivated Justin as Kirn sped him through the years of his adolescence.  On one page he was out to score pot and a scant hundred pages later he was striding up a mountain to save his father's life with scarcely any explanation for his behavior in between.<br />Although the incidents of this book were fun to read, they didn't work together well as a novel, so I can't quite give it two thumbs up.	2002-09-02

In The Perks of Being a Wallflower this 15-year-old high school freshman writes a series of letters to a stranger.  Charlie's first letter sets up several questions.  Why did Charlie make his teachers nervous last year after his friend Michael's suicide?  What problems does Charlie have at home?  What bad thing happened to his Aunt Helen?  Charlie concludes  \\"Some people really do have it a lot worse than I do.  They really do.\\"<br />Written over the 1991-1992 school year the remaining letters are instructive reading for anyone who has forgotten the hellish nature of adolescence. But The Perks of Being a Wallflower is misplaced as a young adult novel.  Although the protagonist is young, the themes of this book are adult, treated without any assumption of a happy ending or any other formulaic convention<br />Wallflower is a strikingly original novel.  Although the rhythm of Charlie's speech is reminiscent of Holden Caulfield (Catcher in the Rye), he seems to have more purity and a different kind of wisdom than Holden.  Some similarities could also be drawn between Wallflower and some of the works of Robert Cormier (in particular, I Am the Cheese).  But Charlie is a child of the 1990's, and although odd, he is sophisticated.  His observations about the struggles of the people are sharp and relevant to anyone interested in human nature.	2002-08-29

Young adult and children's literature has always had to be written with an ear for language.  But actually writing books in free verse?  Writing entire novels as extended narrative poetry?  Well, yes.  Virginia Euwer Wolff does just that in True Believer, which won the 2001 National Book Award for Young People's Literature.<br />The sequel to Make Lemonade, True Believer is strong enough to stand alone.  It is the story of LaVaughn's 15th year, her struggle to stay focused on getting to college despite the heartbreak she sees around her and the distraction of her own shifting relationships.  Her mother has taken on more responsibilities at work; her two best friends have joined \\"Cross Your Legs for Jesus,\\" and not even having seen the devastation that an unplanned pregnancy can wreak on a teen's life can stop her from thinking about one special young man.<br />The verse works better as a narrative device than as poetry.  (A random example:  \\"Their adults congratulated them/and put out a sign-up clipboard for joining/but I didn't write my name.\\" p. 132)  But LaVaughn has such integrity and the odds are so stacked against her that within the first 30 pages I forgot about the unusual format.  Whether the verse works well as poetry or not becomes a moot point as LaVaughn's thoughts form an authentic and unforgettable story.	2002-08-28

Six years ago I was crashing in laundry rooms in houses with, as Dan Zevin puts it, \\"more roommates than rooms.\\"  I strode through the streets of Seattle after dark without fear, carrying kicky little handbags made of cola cans, and met most of my ever-changing circle of boyfriends through personal ads in an alternative paper.  Now I'm hooked up with one person, own part of a condo, and the hippest thing about me is my actual hips, which have broadened to accommodate my two kids.

Second, there are signs of aging (\\"I Am a Figure of Authority\\", \\"My Social Circle Has Shriveled and Shrunk\\", \\"Getting Dressed is Getting Harder\\"). And third, there are essays reflecting a general fear of drifting into even deeper realms of the uncool (\\"Going Out Has Been Replaced by Going Out to Dinner\\", \\"The World is No Longer My Oyster,\\" \\"Paternal Instincts are Plaguing Me\\").  I identified so strongly I read passages of this book to anyone who would listen.  My partner, my brother, the other Mommies in my toddler's playgroup-we all compared notes and found this book to be truer than true.  Ruefully true.  And funny.  Did I mention funny already?<br />But when I read some passages to my parents, who still find Willie Nelson cool, they shrugged.  Sure, it was amusing, but they thought Zevin had a long ways to go.  So yeah-I would have given this book 5 stars.  I'm a Gen Xer who was once glad to have enough money for a bottomless cup of coffee and am now glad to have an IRA.  But it looks like the appeal is limited to me &amp; my kind.ed to me &amp; my kind.	2002-08-25

In Pen Pals, Jennifer Spencer goes to prison to take the fall on an insider trading scam for her boss Donald and her fiance/lawyer Tom.  Spencer has apparently never seen a single movie set in prison, as she approaches the setting with the ridiculously naive expectation that she will get \\"special treatment\\" because her lawyer said he'd call ahead and request it for her.  She doesn't expect to be strip searched at Intake, for example, and she doesn't know enough to anticipate that her belt will be taken from her.<br />She certainly isn't prepared for those she meets inside the prison:  The Warden, Gwen Harding; Movita, a black woman who talks like you'd expect a black woman to talk if a wealthy white woman was writing her dialogue; Cher, the prison toughie who envy's Jennifer's silk underwear; Theresa, who is addicted to spouting platitudes, and Suki, a blonde Christian gal whose naivete surpasses even Jennifer's.  Toss in the requisite sadistic corrections officer along with the requisite kindly corrections officer.  Mix with the fact that Jennifer eventually wises up to the fact that she's been duped by her boss and her fiance, and darned if you don't have a story, even if it isn't that well-written.<br />The characters are unusually sweet-natured; most of them are in prison because they've been wronged by men; and the dialogue, while delightfully informal, sounds forced.  The most vivid writing in this book is Goldsmith's description of all the luxuries Jennifer misses in prison. Readable to Olivia Goldsmith fans, or those who have to read every prison story that comes down the pike.	2002-08-23

If the sexual hijinx of unwashed bodies aren't your speed, you may want to either give this book a pass or read it selectively.  If they are your speed, you'll find this book funny in spots, a cleverly-written story about one man's rise to the top through a succession of steamy little galleys and famous restaurant kitchens.<br />Anyone interested in a career in the biz will find pages 75-105 particularly valuable.  \\"How to Cook Like the Pros\\" is a quick compendium of a few tools and ingredients Bourdain considers essential to the home kitchen (he's big on shallots and butter).  \\"Owner's Syndrome and Other Medical Anomolies\\" is a cautionary glance at three types of failed restaurant owners, and \\"Bigfoot\\" is a case study of one successful example of the species.  The chapter entitled \\"So You Want to Be a Chef?  A Commencement Address\\" (pp. 293-299) is also well worth reading.<br />Serious \\"foodies\\" and those who want to read about the mystique or joy of food preparation and the restaurant industry will want to avoid this book, however, perhaps in favor of Ruth Reichl's Tender to the Bone or Debra Ginsberg's Waiting.	2002-08-20
US	51144977	R2CL27NHYB5M7V	087113795X	996091853	Peace Like a River	Books	5	14	15	N	Y	Miracles in Minnesota	Leif Engels' Peace Like a River is a book expansive in story and distinctive in narrative voice.<br />Rube Land narrates his memory of the events of his eleventh year, the year his brother Davy shot two town bullies, and the effects of those events on his family. His father, the classic literary Christ figure, performs miracles and counsels forgiveness even as the family suffers the judgment of the Roofing, Minnesota townspeople. His sister Swede, age 9, provides the family's heart and resilience with her precocious Scout Finch-like insights and cowboy poetry. Rube himself witnesses events that leave him struggling harder for breath. And when Davy busts out of jail and heads for the hills, the family piles in an Airstream trailer and heads out to find him-with the \\"putrid feds\\" right on their tail.<br />Rube's voice in Peace Like a River is just right-honest, hard on himself and others, and humorous in spots. Unlike other literary novelists, Engels sacrifices nothing for the voice: the plot is equally strong and all the elements of the story in place. Tragedy is spiced with comedy; guilt with innocence; and violence with peace. Peace Like a River is my idea of the perfect novel-a 5 star read.	2002-08-20

He has given up his apartment and now lives exclusively in Airworld-the pristine, aphysical, controllable world of recycled air and first class upgrades.  In the beginning of the book, he tells a seatmate that this, Airworld, is the place to see America.  \\"Not down there, where the show is almost over,\\" he says (p. 42). He is a latter day Buddy Glass (Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenter! J.D. Salinger), observing the absurdity of the phenomena around him with equal parts reflection and irritation.  But as Bingham tries to stick to his frenetic schedule he comes awry of one chaotic disruption after another in what he begins to suspect is a corporate conspiracy targeted at him. As Airworld unravels, he has to face what he has worked so hard to deny.<br />Walter Kirn has a contemporary writing style that relies heavily on disaffection and humor. In an interview with Princeton he states that he wanted to write the story after realizing that there is a conflict between an information-age air travel culture that \\"disperses our physical presence\\" and the fact that \\"we haven't managed to squirm out of our own bodies yet.\\"  Kirn not only explores this conflict but gives it a home in this work of post-Beatnik journey literature.<br />The writing is graceful, the story compelling, and the ending punctuates the story with a taste of the unforgettable.  Up in the Air is going to be one of my favorites for a long, long time.	2002-08-19

Liyani is reluctant to go.  \\"St. Louis air smelled of tar and doughnuts, old boards washed up out of the muddy river, red bricks, and licorice...How could Liyani give all this up?\\"  But in giving up America, Liyani discovers Palestine/Israel in the kind of detail noticed by a young girl who keeps notebooks full of the first lines of stories and poems.<br />Habibi is a strongly autobiographical work.  Like Liyani, Naomi Shihab Nye was born in St. Louis to a Palestinian father and an American mother.  Like Liyani, she had a younger brother.  And like Liyani, Naomi moved from St. Louis to Jerusalem the year she was 14.  The characters are particularly vivid.  Rafik, Liyani's younger brother, is a Star Trek fan full of mischief and practical jokes.  Poppy, her father, is understandably anxious about Liyani's public behavior in a land where women don't display their legs or hold hands in public. Sitti, her grandmother, tells wonderful stories using Poppy as a translator.  And Omer, the Jewish boy who befriends Liyani, is drawn as both wise and sympathetic.<br />That the family has moved from an insular part of the world to a place where guns go off down the road provides much of the story's tension.  Aware of the generations of fearful misunderstandings between Palestinians and Israelis, Nye describes incidents in such a way as to leave the reader yearning for peace in the Middle East.  Poet William Stafford has said of Naomi Shihab Nye that \\"reading her work enhances life.\\"  Habibi is a good example of the compassion and heart that her words provide every day people.	2002-08-12

But as a strong Grisham fan, I found lots of things to like about this book.<br />First, the main character is likeable.  Ray is a law professor, ethical, well-paid and contented with his life.  He is dutiful to his father, concerned about his addict brother, and realistically anxious when he finds the money.  He is as concerned about protecting his deceased father's reputation in his search for the money's origin as he is about what to do with the money if it's clean.<br />Second, it is more or less suspenseful.  Grisham has returned from the dry land of the novella and dropped anchor in the legal thriller.  I loved The Firm, Runaway Jury, and The Pelican Brief and I'm glad to find John Grisham returning to the genre.  One caveat though: the suspense in this book is more about the money than it is about any real concern for the characters.<br />And third, Grisham does a good job setting the scene in the small town in Mississippi where Ray grew up.  His description of his ancestral home Maple Run (or, as his brother calls it, \\"Maple Ruin\\") and his description of the various town characters add color to a book that otherwise lacks much detail.<br />That's the biggest problem with The Summons-it just doesn't have enough detail.  I couldn't put the book down because I had to find out how it would end, but the pace through the middle of the story was a little too quick for me.  I felt like I was being pulled through a plot outline rather than reading about real flesh-and-blood people, which made for a meager payoff at the end.<br />A readable book, but not a re-readable one.	2002-08-10

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was such a powerful novel that anyone who has ever read it is going to find it difficult to read Joy in the Morning without at least being vaguely reminded of the first book and possibly just a little disappointed in this one.<br />Joy in the Morning is the story of Annie, who leaves Brooklyn just after her 18th birthday to marry Carl, a young law student at a Midwestern university.  The first year of their marriage is the stuff of subtle drama as Annie and Carl work out their cultural and educational differences.<br />The work is strongly autobiographical.  Like Annie, Betty Smith left school at the age of 14 to work in factories and retail.  Like Annie, Betty Smith (then Wehmer) left Brooklyn for the Midwest at age 18.  At Ann Arbor, Michigan, she married George Smith, a young law student.  In the book Annie is a writer trying to find her voice, and finds it in playwriting.  Betty Smith was also a playwright-she attended Yale Drama School and had over 70 plays under belt before she wrote her first novel.<br />With that much stage experience, it is no wonder that Betty Smith is a virtuoso of both pace and dialogue.  The underlying structure of Joy in the Morning is every bit as well-crafted as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  But it is every bit as different from the earlier work as a college town in the Midwest is from New York City.  It is lighter, more sentimental, and less condensed.  The grit of the Brooklyn streets is softened here.  Though there are allusions to her stepfather's behavior in her bedroom being part of the reason Annie fled Brooklyn, Smith doesn't show the reader anything truly ugly as she did with Nolan's drinking and death in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  Joy in the Morning is simply a kinder, gentler read, a sweet story about the first year of marriage in a new town.ut the first year of marriage in a new town.	2002-08-10

He's more than just a competent writer-he's a golden boy who just merited Pulitzer Prize for Empire Falls.  Russo is a hardworking, compassionate author and he has produced a body of work that his readers have learned to trust.  The Whore's Child And Other Stories does not break that trust, but it does test it a bit.<br />There are three kinds of stories in this book.  \\"Joy Ride\\" and \\"The Mysteries of Linwood Hart\\" are high impact stories written in 3rd person about prepubescent male protagonists observing their parents' marriage problems.  These are wonderful stories, my favorite in the collection both for their tenderness and insight.<br />\\"Monhegan Light,\\"  \\"Buoyancy\\" and \\"Poison\\" take the middle-aged or retired male as their protagonist and explore the discrepancies of marriage in the post prime of life.  Russo does these stories well, and if they seem similar to each other, that only strengthens the composition of the book as a whole.  The effect is that of riffs on a theme, petaling out of the observant center.<br />\\"The Whore's Child\\" and \\"The Farther You Go\\" weaken this collection however.  In \\"The Whore's Child\\" the voice is of a college writing teacher (a familiar Russo point of view), but the story is that of how Sister Ursula has lived her entire life as a lie in repudiation of the hurt in her childhood.  It's interesting enough and competently written, but it doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the collection.  It also lacks the visceral impact of some of the other stories.  \\"The Farther You Go\\" bothered me because I'd read it before-or large chunks of it anyway-as part of Russo's excellent novel The Straight Man.  It ended differently than in the novel, but it needed the rest of the novel to make it work as a piece.  Without the context of The Straight Man, \\"The Farther You Go\\" seemed like a \\"so what\\" story.  So x and y happens, big deal.<br />So:  two weaker stories and five stronger ones.  (And the term \\"weaker\\" is relative here:  we are talking about a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.)  Still and all, good to read and lots of food for thought.erm \\"weaker\\" is relative here:  we are talking about a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.)

At room temperature, no less.  Of the five Walsh sisters she is the only well-behaved one (as far as people know).  Having married her first boyfriend and landed a paralegal job that was \\"as glamorous as a cold sore,\\" she is known to be the steady, dull one.  So it comes as a great shock when she leaves her husband of nine years, loses her job, and takes off from Ireland for Los Angeles to stay with her screenwriter friend Emily.  It isn't long before she discovers that culture shock is the least of her problems in the land of dissolving marriages, movie extras, plastic surgery, and casual sex.<br />Angels is a book full of joy and sadness, artistry and humor. There is a story underneath a story underneath a story here, and Marian Keyes works simultaneously both forward and backward from the break-up to lead the reader to the story's surprising conclusion.  I read it, laughing out loud in parts, and thoroughly enjoyed what I thought was a well-written light read.  But the last third of the book sandbagged me with its unexpected depths.  By the end it becomes clear that if Maggie Walsh is vanilla yogurt, it is yogurt with raspberries buried underneath the surface.  One last thought:  this book must have been fun to write, because it sure was a blast to read.  Definitely worth 5 s tars.	2002-08-06

So I was looking forward to a Michael Mooreish book which poked bitter fun at the Fat Corporate Giant. I wanted dark humor and shocking facts.  And I'll admit, as someone who once submitted a resume to Amazon, I was looking for a book about how depressing things were behind the Techno Curtain.<br />I got some of what I expected.  21 Dog Years is funny.  I brought the book to dinner, and my partner had to ask me not to snort so much, as it affected his appetite.  It's more Letterman-funny than Moore-funny, though, and we're talking the kinder, gentler, post-heart surgery Letterman.  It's also somewhat bitter and anti-corporate.  Daisey does a wonderful job of nailing down the miasma of misery that permeated the culture of Seattle 20-somethings in the 1990's.  He uses imaginary emails to Jeff Bezos (Amazon's top dog) to channel some of that bitterness.  Though the book is short on shocking facts, Daisey describes pranks he pulled as an employee just to get through his shift, such as sending free books to random people and hanging up on every 4th or 5th caller to keep his phone response time down.  As a Seattleite, I particularly enjoyed his decription of local scenes and events, such as Amazon's party the morning the Kingdome was imploded.<br />What I didn't expect was this book's greatest gift to me as a reader:  sudden moments of clarity and grace.  Daisey's book is more beauty than bile, more vitality than vitriole.  The book is written about Daisey's ambivalent relationship with Amazon, and he writes about it with equal parts of awe and understanding.  Sudden moments of holiness pop up throughout the prose.  His description of a scene with Babcia (his wife's grandmother), scenes with Jean-Michele (his wife), and the context in which he places his ex-obsession after September 11th  are all examples of this.  All in all, this was a very satisfying book.of this.  All in all, this was a very satisfying book.	2002-08-01

Skif is intelligent, good-hearted and creative enough to forage up three meals a day in a place where food is scarce and kindness almost unheard of.  After a chain of events leave him homeless, Skif lands in the lair of Bazie, an Faginish ex-mercenary who trains thieves.<br />If you've never read a novel of Valdemar before, take heart:  Take a Thief stands alone and serves as a good introduction to that land.  Lackey is a wonderful writer with particular talent for setting a scene and drawing you into the life of a sympathetic character.  Though Skif speaks in heavy dialect, Lackey writes his speech with a skillful hand so that the dialect is not disruptive.<br />The flaws in the story are few, but noticeable.  Lackey draws her peripheral characters almost too well, so that one feels cheated when a character disappears from the scene and doesn't ever get another mention.  The pacing of the book is perfect for the first 75% of the story, but then speeds up too much as it approaches the big climax.  As a result the story wears a little bit thin towards the end as you begin to suspect that Lackey may be on a bit of a soapbox here.<br />Still don't let that deter you.  Though this book may only deserve 3 or 3 and a half stars for technical merit, it is still a thoroughly enjoyable read.	2002-07-31

Words Under the Words is a collection of works from three earlier books:  Different Ways to Pray, Hugging the Jukebox, and Yellow Glove.  In this collection, her poetry celebrates the interconnectedness of the human spirit and the ordinary world.  A stranger's eyes, once met, become the eyes of a fellow (Eye-to-Eye, p. 11); a serving woman's lined face tells a story of great worth (The Indian in the Kitchen, p.4); and images of Guatemala eulogize the passing of indigenous culture in service to the industrial world (Getting Through the Day, p.  69).<br /> Nye's poetry is informed by her sense of place:  Kindness (p.42) could have been written nowhere but from Colombia.  Before you learn the solemnity of kindness, she writes, you must see a dead person lying roadside. \\"You must see how this could be you/how he, too, was someone/who journeyed through the night with plans/and the simple breath that kept him alive.\\"  Many of the poems in this book have been written from different Central and South American countries-others in the Middle East, in the United States-there is even a poem about being lost in Kansas.<br />In an interview with Rachel Berenblat, Nye said she has written poems from childhood.  \\"I liked the portable, comfortable shape of poems,\\" she said.  \\"I liked the way they took you to a deeper, quieter place, almost immediately.\\"  It is no surprise, then, that these poems are accessible and harmonious, written in the language of empathy and compassion.	2002-07-29

I have to say that I strongly identified with this theme, and so may be rating this collection a little higher than someone else would, but Simpson really nails the mom thing.  I found myself reading large sections out loud to my partner as my toddler pulled out all the toys I'd just put away.<br />In \\"Cafe Society\\" two mothers meet for conversation and a little intellectual stimulation.  They are aware, writes Simpson, \\"that the odds against this happening are about fifty to one.\\"  Still, they persevere, and most of their conversation happens mentally as they wrangle the toddler.  A couple of the women in the stories reappear in other stories, and I found myself hoping that Simpson would stick with just those women and wishing she'd written a novel about them.<br />Some of the stories, written around some themes having to do with the end of the millenium, seem a little dated.  \\"Millenium Blues\\" is such a story, and probably should not have been included in this collection, both because the fears expressed already seem quaint and because the ending is absurd.  Absurdity doesn't fit well with the rest of the collection, which is generally a diary of domestic life in its small details and despairs.<br />All in all, a light read, but a definite \\"don't skip\\" if you are a toddlerian (ie, you happen to have small children at home).	2002-07-29

The old order crumbles to give way to the new.  The Catholic church plans to conduct mass in English.  The boys in blue who've always kept order with their fists are under scrutiny for the beating of three black choirboys on Christmas Eve.  And on the streets, addicts die in record numbers from strange new synthetic drugs.<br />The book opens with the body of a murdered priest, found on a snowy runway at Logan Airport.  Ray Dunn, assistant D.A. and son of a cop who was on the take, investigates the killing as his younger brother Biff joins up with the guys at Narcotics.  In the background: the shadowy hand of the federal government conducting experiments on psychiatric patients.<br />Bag Men fulfills its potential as a suspenseful read with an unguessable climax.  Some of the secondary characters are a little weak, but the primary characters are interesting enough to keep the reader's attention on the story.  One note:  John Flood is the pseudonym of Mark Costello, a federal prosecutor in Boston and author of Big If.  Bag Men is the more rough-hewn of the two books.  So if you read Bag Men and enjoy it, do yourself a favor and read Big If as well.	2002-07-28

It is the story of two people's second chance at love after one of them has been through a nasty divorce and the other has lost his wife in a hit-and-run accident.  The details of the courtship are formulaic (Sparks provides us with the heroine's hair color, for example) and not terribly inventive.

So it comes as a great shock to everyone who knows him when he is arrested on suspicion of an old unsolved murder.  Well--a shock to everyone but Kat, the 12-year-old neighbor who provided the anonymous tip that got him arrested. So begins Alice Hoffman's Blue Diary, which explores how catastrophically this single event haunts Ethan's family, friends, and neighbors.<br />Blue Diary is a book that would be a 5-star read against 95 percent of what's on the bookshelf.  Hoffman's stiffest competition, however, is her own work and Blue Diary doesn't come up to the standard of Practical Magic, Turtle Moon or the River King.  Hoffman's prose is always clear and her stories always interesting, but the lush poetic imagery of earlier novels is missing in this one.  Jorie (Ethan's wife) and Kat (the neighbor kid) are well-drawn characters, but a bit transparent compared to the masterfully painted characters of Hoffman's other books.<br />Nonetheless, Blue Diary makes for an interesting read which poses the thought-provoking question:  how well do you really know anyone? and the paranoia-provoking corollary: how can you be so sure?	2002-07-25

But it got old after a couple of pages, and creepy after a couple more pages when the spirit started referring to herself in the plural and having conversations with her corpse and playing games with her old family whose names she can't remember well and I have to admit a prejudice here--I cringed and almost put the thing down but as I read on it got more and more worth it.

On one level these could be the stories of any small town:  the bit characters are universal-gossip mongers who know (or think they know) just about everything about each other.  But on another level, these characters are uniquely Arkansan and their struggles pinned in place and time to the three generations who inherited the chaos and eventual resettling of the post-slavery era.<br />\\"Red Sky at Night,\\" is the story of a baseball game between the white men of Sugars Springs and the black men of Bethel.  This story, set in 1905 serves as an introduction both to the characters and the tensions of the novel.  \\"Red Sky at Dawn\\" is set a year later, and introduces the element of chaos in the form of a tornado that hits the town without warning.  \\"Ransom Passing\\" explores the personal history of one ex-slave and then moves forward in time to his grandson's life.  \\"Baby, Leaving,\\" and \\"The Choosing of Little Jewel\\" demonstrate gender tensions among families of both races.  Finally, \\"The Salvation of Cora Emery McRae\\" highlights religion's role in the South.<br />Although the language is unmistakably Arkansan, Myra McLarey's voice is more fluid than the traditional women writers of the south.  Think Alice Hoffman rather than Eudora Welty or Flannery O'Connor.  While the depth of the characters and the vividly-painted context make this book a worthwhile read, it is the lyrical prose which makes it unforgettable.	2002-07-22

Over 400 pages, this compendium of ideas for \\"less stressful, more joyful living\\" is heavy on the many philosophical ideas that fall under the simple living umbrella.  In 14 topical chapters ranging from Money to Virtues Luhrs balances her occasionally redundant reflections with sidebars highlighting case studies, offering tips, and providing the nuts &amp; bolts how-to's.  Some of these are tremendously helpful and/or interesting.  For example, in the chapter on Simple Pleasures and Romance, there is an article by Kirk S. Nevin about his family's decision to live without electricity or plumbing; and the chapter on Inner Simplicity includes a very practical article on dealing with insomnia.<br />Other sidebars are less helpful, more a mish-mash of 12-step generalisms, such as Luhrs' list of the 28 secrets to happiness, including \\"get organized,\\" \\"be humble\\" and \\"learn from the past, plan for the future, and live in the present\\".<br />My two primary criticisms are that most of the ideas in this book are available elsewhere (see The Tightwad Gazette or Your Money or Your Life) and that some ideas aren't included.  There is almost nothing here about permaculture, for example, and very little attempt at introducing serious or radical sustainability.<br />This book is a great primer for people who may have never encountered simple living philosophies before; however, those steeped in an already-intentional lifestyle will find little here that is new.	2002-07-21

Stokes tends to rely heavily on life's passages to make her points in The Blue Bottle Club, the story of four women's lives from 1929 through 1994.  Funerals in particular are given a lot of room on the page as times when wisdom is passed from generation to generation.<br />My grandmother and I both read this book.  She's in her 80's and Christian.  I'm in my 30's and not.  She found it satisfying; I found it sentimental.  She liked the way the characters were drawn and found a chord of realism throughout the book.  I thought the characters were not drawn fully enough--sketched would be the word I'd use, and found the realism of the book challenged by the way in which every significant character eventually finds her relationship with God.<br />It was an easy, quick read, however--a &quot;knife-through-butter&quot; read--and in spite of myself and my objections to the book I was compelled to finish it.  It's definitely a &quot;your mileage may vary&quot; book, one which will give you back a reflection of what you are bringing to it.<br />My grandmother would probably give this book 5 stars.  Without her input, I'd have given 3.  Thus the compromise rating:  4 stars.	2002-07-20

Mercedes Lackey uses the tale of Sleeping Beauty as a jumping-off point for The Gates of Sleep, the story of Marina, an elemental mage of water and her coming-of-age in Edwardian Cornwall and Devon. As in The Fire Rose (set in turn-of-the-century San Francisco) and The Serpent's Shadow (Victorian London), mages and Masters of Earth, Fire, Water, and Air battle against ceremonial magicians of the Left-Hand path, with fairy-tale-esque results.  It's no surprise to anyone that Evil is conquered by Good in a Lackey novel--the author's artistry is in the drawing of identifiable characters in very realistic settings.  Historical details provide such down-to-earth context for the appearance of undines, sylphs, fauns and the like that the whole story becomes believable.<br />One of Lackey's best--an absorbing read.	2002-07-18

Written in part after Ram Dass's stroke in 1997, Still Here touches the core of weakness and all the bogeymen that come with it.  Loneliness, embarrassment, powerlessness, loss of role/meaning, and depression are explored in the early part of the book--and that's all before Ram Dass gets to the good stuff.  As in Journey of Awakening and Be Here Now, the author does a wonderful job of clearly explaining the cause of human suffering and its remedy.<br />I bought this book because I wanted to better understand my grandmother's world and what my parents are beginning to face, but I ended up experiencing its apt relevance to 36-year-old me.	2002-07-18

Each character in this small town has a personal struggle against this gradual descent.  In effect then, Russo writes the perfect story of both universal and personal entropy. That he can do all that in a way that is compassionate, philosophical and funny makes Empire Falls a great read and a worthy recipient of the Pulitzer.	2002-07-11

In this role, he sails the rough waters of the fragile egos of his contemporaries during April, not only the cruellest month but also a time of paranoia for faculty who are afraid they won't be hired back.  (As an ex-secretary in higher academia, I can attest to the accuracy with which Russo nails down department politics.) In the week that his wife Lily is gone, Devereaux manages to get mangled, drunk, televised and jailed.  But these are the smallest of his problems as he battles with his own mortality and tries to ignore the return of his father, whom he has tried to avoid turning into all of his life.<br />Unlike other writers of the absurdist academe subgenre, Russo creates characters that live beyond the pages of the book.  Hank Devereaux has a sense of humor, but what makes him unforgettable is the secret sympathy with which he views the people he knows and the merciless philosophy he applies to his own and others' conditions.	2002-06-28

Once again Palahniuk makes short work of invoking compassion for his lost boy viewpoint character by daring you to like him in spite of all the reasons not to.  And, if you're like me, you do.  You pull for Victor even when he's told you not to.  You pull for him through the most scatalogical, pornagraphic, manipulated and just plain sick moments of your reading life, and you feel either thrilled or sordid yourself as you are led through all the messed-up elements of his messed-up life.<br />Me, I felt sordid.  I wanted to put the book down after the third page, but the writing was too strong and the character too compelling.  I gave it four stars because of the writing power, but kind of wish I had never read it at all.  I think that, like Fight Club, it's going to be with me for a long time.	2002-06-21
US	51144977	R2OOARZL9UH6B3	0385720467	133960389	Disobedience: A Novel	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Bold Decisions	A rite of passage story about Henry, who at 17 has discovered his mother's infidelity by reading her email messages, Disobedience explores complex family and gender themes. Marital strife, the disillusionment of a young man with his mother, a pubescent girl's rejection of her female self, and the desire of all members of the family to live in some form of fantasy rather than reality form the spine of this story.<br />Jane Hamilton has made some bold decisions as an author in the writing of Disobedience.  Henry's imagination about the affair is the primary source of information about his mother's feelings.  Hamilton loops back and forth through time as she follows Henry's description of the events of his senior year from his vantage point as an adult almost ten years later.  Hamilton has written a novel about infidelity in which the wife, the husband and the lover are all still likable, wherein no one person is painted with a black and white brush.  The Shaw family that Henry observes is both distanced by time and brought forward by passion in such a way that the reader is never at rest, never lulled into an easy acceptance of the narrative line.<br />I highly recommend Disobedience for a thought or discussion-provoking read.  Just don't expect it to be unchallenging.	2002-06-21

With Big If, he writes a novel that defies easy classification.  Big If is politically suspenseful, humorous, domestic, and literary, with a few elements of near-futuristic science fiction.  Like George Orwell (who wrote about British society in 1948 and disguised it slightly to come up with 1984), Costello writes with a great deal of insight into contemporary culture.<br />As the Vice President makes his way around the country on the campaign trail, the Secret Service people who protect him each deal with their own monsters and visions of potential disaster.  Gretchen, a survivor of the L.A. riots of 1965 and 1991, has to balance the pressures of single motherhood with her highly demanding job.  Tashmo's having marital problems dating back to his days with Felker on the Reagan team. Always alert for potential assassins, Vi is in conflict with her brother Jens, a programmer who designs monsters for a web-action survival game called Big If.  Bobbie just wants to make it through the campaign alive so she can land another wealthy husband.  As in Lawrence Kasden's 1992 movie Grand Canyon, the unexpected strikes again and again, keeping the reader glued to the page.<br />The result is a funny, suspenseful, and truthful book of great interest to anyone who grew up American in the last 50 years, whether you're usually drawn to political suspense or not.	2002-06-16

Clara Hutt is a married mother of two with the still sharp perspective of an individual, and Knight does a good job writing some funny inner dialogue for Clara.  She also explores the complexity of what makes for unhappiness in married life, although not as well as Nick Hornby does in How to Be Good.<br />I read this book in a single day, but as I turned the last page I realized that a number of things about Clara really bugged me.  For one thing, she's too self-deprecating.  Most mothers I know are too busy to obsess so constantly about whether their thighs are too large.  Another bothersome character trait is Clara's tendency to get drunk and say really stupid things in high-risk situations.  This is a professional woman?  This is a grown up?  The more I thought about it, the more it annoyed me.  Check it out from the library for a light read.  But don't make a permanent place for it on your bookshelf.	2002-06-14

The message from the trenches is loud and clear:  we may not be June Cleaver, but we love our messy imps.<br />Ayun Halliday writes with humor and love of her husband Greg and two children, Inky and Milo.  Their day-to-day adventures stomping through the streets of the Big Apple make hilarious and heart-tugging reading.  Halliday is particularly gifted at capturing the wisdom of her preschool-aged daughter who says things like \\"Daddy smells bad\\" as the Dad in question is puking his guts out while Halliday is going into labor with her second child.<br />Birth and nursing stories aside, Halliday writes from the perspective of someone who has landed on a strange planet and is determined to make the best of it.  In other words, she gives voice to the kind of mother I find myself being, which makes her work almost impossible to put down.	2002-06-09

Nick Hornby plunges into the psyche of a woman facing a spiritual crisis in his How to Be Good, an ambitious novel that occasionally brakes for wisdom in its compulsion to entertain.<br />Kate, whose goodness is proved by her profession as a doctor, is unhappily married to David, a professional cynic who is \\"like me, highly skilled in the art of marital warfare.\\"  When Kate impulsively says the unthinkable (not \\"I want a divorce\\"), David is propelled into a series of actions which result in a fundamental personality change.  Now that David is pursuing the path of spiritual purity, how is Kate to deal with her own failings as a human being?<br />Hornby raises the question of what \\"good\\" is throughout the novel, focusing on two major possibilities.  \\"Good\\" is intent and adherence to an ideal, or \\"good\\" is a series of charitable actions.  Neither of these interpretations is enough to keep a marriage going in and of itself, and the clashes between different types of being good lead to scenes ranging from laugh-out-loud funny to wince-inducing.  In the end, the exploration of the theme seems introductory rather than conclusory.<br />What impressed me the most about this book was how well Hornby wrote from Kate's point of view.  In the post Bridget Jones era of ridiculous anti-feminist female protagonists, Kate is refreshingly reflective and complex.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining and thought-provoking read who doesn't have the patience for the sex-booze-shopping-dieting genre.	2002-06-09

Described as a memoir beginning at Bennington college and moving on to her first years in New York, the book focuses much less on Norris's coming of age than it does on the events before, during and after her friendship with Betty Kray, the executive director of the Academy of American Poets.<br />The primary fault with the book does not lie with the author, who admits at the end of the first chapter that the story begins with &quot;an untidy but cheerful job interview&quot; at the end of her college years.  It lies instead with whoever decided to sensationalize what could be described as a quiet but interesting book of tribute to a woman who devoted herself to poets and poetry.  Norris's prose is clear and easy to read.  But her description of her brushes with famous and not-so-famous poets in New York in the 1970's are not that interesting, as the encounters themselves tend to be of the mundane variety.  The true kernel of this book is Norris's love and admiration for Elizabeth Kray, which is only briefly alluded to on the book's cover.  In sum, a bit of a disappointment.<br />For a true coming-of-age memoir, check out Susanna Kaysen's Girl Interrupted or the more recent humorously written Tender at the Bone by Ruth Reichl.	2002-06-08

Deeply shocked, she maintains her love for him and her belief in herself through the process of finding out what happened, why he's asking her to leave, and accepting the outcome of that process.<br />Madeleine St. John uses realistic and often witty dialogue between peripheral characters to demonstrate how the break up of two people can have an effect on almost everyone they know.  Although she writes with a light touch, she explores the relationship dynamics between four other couples while giving play to the fragility of any love relationship.  The Essence of the Thing is a quick and entertaining read, but it could not be described as shallow by any stretch of the imagination.	2002-06-07

If you like historical forensic medicine, you'll find the first 25 pages fascinating, as the analysis of a murder scene unfolds with pinpoint historical accuracy. You'll also enjoy the many references to the police procedures of the time as the Inspector mentors Franz, a young policeman in the fundamentals of patient investigation. For this purpose, Shields relies heavily on the System der Kriminalistik, by Hans gross, published in 1904. One of the passages read begins \\"When he starts work, the most important thing for the Investigating Officer is to discover the exact moment when he can form a definite opinion. The importance of this cannot be too much insisted upon, for upon it success or failure often depends.\\"<br /><br />The same might be said of a writer, and therein lies the failure of this book. Shields values the pieces of information she has come across too highly and maintains a psychic distance from the characters of the story. Though she uses myriad historical details to pin the reader into place, she fails to allow us to grow close to, or care much about, the characters. Even the most intriguing character (Erzebet, the Inspector's wife, who lives in a mental landscape of Hungarian folk tales) is viewed as if from the wrong end of a telescope. Specifically, the two most disruptive elements in the writing style are the choppiness of the passages (seldom does one scene last longer than a couple of pages), and Shields's stylistic reliance on the present tense. This lends the book to being difficult to staying involved with, and difficult to pick up again once it is put down.	2002-06-06

Conversely, the book has the power to make those who live on the labor of others very uncomfortable.  I've done both, and so found The Nanny Diaries to be a story alternately righteous and self-righteous, but always nail-on-the-head truthful.<br />Though the book starts out in a satirical vein, as Nan becomes more entrenched in the lives of those she serves the story deepens and both Grayer and Mrs. X become...well, if not sympathic, at least understandable.  The only completely unsympathetic character is Mr. X, who is seen most distantly.  One of the subtler points of the book is about the hierarchy of families, whether they employ others to support that hierarchy or not.  As the novel progresses, it becomes clear that Mrs. X lives in service to Mr. X just as much as Nan lives in service to the X family.<br />Don't let the potential for depth spoil your reading of the book, though.  It is satirical and funny.  It is a quick and engrossing read.  It's just not entirely fiction when viewed in the context of classism in American culture.	2002-06-05

A month by month deconstruction of the not-so-typical academic year in a very typical Midwestern University, The Big U is probably most interesting to three different groups:  Neal Stephenson's readers, readers of academic satire, and anyone traumatized by a college experience in the '80's.<br />Stephenson readers may be most disappointed in the tenor of the book.  Although it doesn't live up to the standards of his later novels, however, The Big U is a microscopic look at the germs of ideas that Stephenson more fully developed in Snow Crash.  Most notable of these:  the Worm, a powerful computer virus that only one Ubergeek can successfully battle.  But the very elements most interesting to Stephenson fans may baffle fans of academic satire, who would probably prefer a straightforward romp, such as Jane Smiley's Moo U.<br />This novel cannot be evaluated outside of the context of the 1980's, when the words \\"date rape\\" were just beginning to be uttered.  In colleges across the midwest, the world was divided between the Reaganites and those who lived in constant awareness that Missouri housed at least 165 nuclear missiles.  Something called AIDS hit the news, and there were some projections that huge numbers of the general population would be dead in 10 years.  Anybody who knew what a mouse was was automatically a geek and proud to be one. The Big U is probably most valuable for its sociological grasp of all the factions and campus groups coming to a head in that time.<br />Because I am a Neal Stephenson reader, a fan of academic satire and a survivor of the '80's, I found The Big U a wonderful read, and couldn't put it down.  I liked the characters all the way through, stayed interested in the plot, and couldn't wait to find out what happened.  I wasn't disappointed, but did find some of the scenes a bit violent.  Thus, the four-star rating.	2002-06-03

Nell Dysart, obviously not at the highest point in her life, comes to work at Gabe McKenna's detective agency, and finds herself at the nexus of a twenty-year-old mystery involving her ex-husband's family.  It's a well-executed and unpredictable plotline, but as with other Crusie novels, the plot is not the point.  The way it is written is what makes this book stand out above others in both the romance and suspense genres.  And the laugh-per-page ratio is very high.<br />But what do you expect from a woman who claims to get her ideas from Sears?  Who says researching her sex scenes is a hassle because she always has to keep one hand free to take notes?  Crusie (who is working on a PhD in literature) is herself at least as fascinating as her characters, to whom she pays the utmost attention as they grieve, recover, and find their strengths as women and lovers.<br />I highly recommend Fast Women for a wonderful escapist read, with one caveat:  don't read while you're waiting at an airport.  You'll miss your flight announcement.	2002-06-03

Stella Blackstone's sing-song rhyme gets caught up a couple of times, such as when the bear is \\"going to a castle/where night is turned to day/where princes and princesses dance/and merry music plays\\".

I'd tried to read The Accidental Tourist when I was in my twenties, and dismissed it as dry.  Back When We Were Grownups, however, bursts with the juice of messy real-life characters in messy real-life situations.  The lure of the road not taken pales beside Rebecca's noisy crowded life, and the humor and perspective she brings to her observations more than compensate for the longing she feels for her younger (true?) self.<br />I was so absorbed in the story I didn't have time to evaluate the questions Tyler raises of how identity is formed and what the meaning of one's life is when one is peering through the eyes of a stranger.  In retrospect, however, these questions, how they are raised and how they are answered, linger in my mind in a satisfying echo to what was the most satisfying read I've had in a long time.	2002-06-01
US	51144977	R3EIJ7QTPEWEFW	014029628X	180693945	Girl in Hyacinth Blue	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Passion Versus Perspective	In Girl in Hyacinth Blue, Susan Vreeland crafts the history of Vermeer's fictitious \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" from the chilly study of a contemporary math teacher to the passionate painter's daughter who sat for the portrait.  The eight stories which vaguely map this history challenge the structures of human relationship by delving into the private world of the observer...and hovering there in the tension between passion and perspective.<br />To read the stories in the context of chronology (ie, backwards from the end of the book) is to read of the decline of the personal in favor of the proprietal.  To read them in proper order is to join Vreeland in a conspiracy of engagement in human love and passion for life against chronology, current culture and the 20th century's most heinous crime.	2002-05-31

Violent but engaging in the earlier chapters, the book quickly devolves into a series of convenient close-brush-with-death events culminating in a sleep-inducing ending. People who love pictures of cute little puppy dogs and babies dressed as sunflowers should have no problem with the last two-thirds of this book, which is as patently undisturbing as the first few chapters are needlessly sensational.	2002-05-31
US	51144977	R101JBLFW06DV0	0767904540	773255064	On Rue Tatin: Living and Cooking in a French Town	Books	3	11	17	N	N	Falls Flat	_On Rue Tatin_ falls as flat as a cake peered at too often by a too-eager cook.  Though Susan Herrmann Loomis is a good reporter, detailing life in France with occasional insight, she never breaks into genuine wisdom or true authorship.  The book reads as if she followed a recipe while writing it, and lacks the comedy and warmth of, say, Ruth Reichl's _Comfort Me With Apples_.<br />On the other hand, it's set in France and it's got a lot of food in it.  So what's to really dislike?  It's just:  when you're expecting Brie, it's hard to settle for (yawn) a mild American cheddar.	2002-05-26

Well worth the list price for contributions by novelist Linda Hogan (Solar Storms), Kenneth Ray Stubbs (The Essential Tantra), and Denise Linn (Sacred Space), the book includes over 60 stories, essays, meditations and poems that range in mood from uplifting (e.g., \\"Magpie Feather\\" by Paul Anderson) and humorous (Mary Lane Kamberg's \\"Fifty Things to Do With a Feather\\") to wise (\\"A Question of Style\\" by Rachel Naomi Remen) and touching (\\"A Special Gift\\" by Penny Wigglesworth).<br />The pieces are arranged in four sections:  The Mystery of Feathers:  Mystical Messages from the Spirit; The Power of Feathers:  Messages of Healing and Transformation; Light as a Feather:  Messages of Freedom, Surrender and Letting Go;  and Where There's a Quill, There's a Way:  Messages of Love, Strength and Courage.<br />In short, definitely the kind of book I'd buy for someone who needed a lift, whether they'd ever thought about feathers specifically before or not.	2002-05-12
