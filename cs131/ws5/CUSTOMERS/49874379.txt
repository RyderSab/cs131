For this reason many traditional churches are unable to meet the needs of their individual members while at the same time striving to fulfill the great commission.

Debt-FREE Living is not so much a &quot;how-to-get-out-of-debt&quot; manual as it is a &quot;change-your-mindset-about-money&quot; type of book.  The book basically takes you through the stories of several couples' struggles with debt from the reasons they got into debt to how they eventually got out.  It is written from a Christian perspective, so much of the advice is based upon the author's interpretation of key scriptural texts regarding money and debt.  <br />While much of the information is good so far as it goes, it is often too general in nature to be of great use to those who are really seeking (and needing) specific advice.  From the subtitle of the book, &quot;How to get out of debt and stay out&quot; some prospective buyers may get the impression that this is a &quot;how-to&quot; book--that is, that it will run through an exhaustive list of specific things they can do to get out of debt.  Unfortunately, that is not the focus of the book.  It does, however, have very good information on personal bankruptcy should you be contemplating that particular option, and it also comes with SnapShot Gold debt management software which should make the book/CD ROM combo worth the price.	2001-07-05

After reading this little volume we may want to take all those notebooks we compiled with our immense theological wisdom and &quot;read 'em and weep.&quot;  Good reading for those interested in the principles of sound interpretation.	2001-03-25

Short overviews of each genre by well known scholars give you a good grasp of the importance of that particular area of interpretation and the pitfalls and fallacies that present themselves with inaccurate exegesis.  While a basic knowledge of Greek is suggested, it is well worth the price of the book for the excellent overview of New Testament background; NT word analysis; sociology and NT exegesis; NT theological analysis; and the function of the OT in the NT - none of which require any Greek.

I found the overviews brief yet satisfying for the fact that they contain a lot of useful, meaty information.  One might expect a book whose purpose is to treat divisive issues to be written from more of a non-partisan stance, however that is not the case here.  I did note however that the author has an eclectic educational  background.  From this I was persuaded that he is an open-minded individual who genuinely has a heart for the truth of the scriptures.  Then again, if the book were written from a neutral point of view, you may never hear the true arguments pro or con for each position.  After you read this book, you may wish to read a few more with different perspectives and compare them to see which seem to be more consistent with the scriptures.	2001-03-03

Comparing writings is much easier since you don't have to search through several different books - they are all in one spot.  While we must acknowledge the fact that the writings do not necessarily represent &quot;dogmatic theological pronouncements,&quot; if you are interested in dicovering what the Early Church Fathers believed, do yourself a favor and get this book.	2001-03-03

The book is fervently argued but tends toward pejorative expression.  While the information is invaluable for those on both (or more) sides of the question, I couldn't help but feel that the book, while attempting to demonstrate why the people of God (Israel and the Church) should not be divided, is itself a vehicle for even more division of the people of God (Dispensationalists and Reformed.)  A quick glance at the comments below should give you a good illustration of this.  If you are contemplating reading this book, just be aware that its intended purpose is not to reconcile and heal the rifts between the two groups, which is probably what Christ would want them to do.	2001-03-02

It is rendered as tastefully as it possibly could be considering that it's purpose is to enlighten us about the greatest human tradgedy that the world has ever known.  <br />The fact that it is presented in a &quot;pleasing-to-the-eye&quot; coffee table style book form seems to desensitize the reader a bit from the sheer horror that was surely felt by those involved.  (Although I don't presume to have a better idea myself on how it might be done.)  However, this actually makes the book more accessible to younger readers as well who need to be informed of the truth of what happened.  But while I feel that the book is not presented with all of the gore that I have seen in others, if one really looks deeply into the photos, and sees the expressions on the people's faces, and relates to them as real human beings and not as just characters in a book, you will surely be moved, and you will come face to face with the reality of the holocaust.	2000-10-06

This knowledge could be quite useful even if you do not  choose to go with the chitosan plan.  You should keep in mind however that  the information does appear to be slanted in favor of high carbohydrate  diets, and attacks extra fat in food as being the main source of our  nutritional problems, whereas most sources I have read agree that excess  energy is stored in our bodies as fat regardless of what type of food the  energy derives from.	2000-08-13

The amount of carbohydrates we eat must be restricted in  some way, form or mean, or even temporarily cut out to achieve the best  results.  <br />What is different about this book is that it actually gives an  explanation for all of our impulsive cravings that actually makes sense and  that you can easily apply to your everyday eating.  I personally keep some  of the advice in mind as to when I eat my carbohydrates even though I  prefer a simple high protein diet that works for me.

Instead of just talking about and around each example the authors funnel  their expertise into little cartoons that make it so easy to grasp the  concepts.  I can really see myself in each example speaking to my kids, and  (yes, unfortunately) I am usually on the doing-it-wrong end of things.   This book should really give me a lot of practical ways to relate to my  children that are immediately usable.<br />Even after gaining the knowledge  contained in this book I'm sure that the key is always being aware of what  is happening so that you do not miss opportunities to use the techniques  that you have learned.  This awareness is probably attained only through  consistent practice of the techniques themselves.  The good news however,  is that you will probably remember the little cartoons better than if you  had simply read about something you were supposed to do in a certain  situation.<br />While the book is aimed at the parent/child or teacher/child  relationship, the concepts are easily transferrable to other social  contexts such as supervisor/worker, boss/employee, etc.  And don't stop  there.  The techniques do not have to be limited to non-peer relationships.   They can be just as effectively applied to peer relationships as well.   They basically cover good, PRACTICAL, communication techniques that are in  essence universal.  In my current guest relations job, I can immediately  use many of the techniques.  They involve denying yourself the satisfaction  of talking down to another person, and trying to find another means to  effectively commuicate without being condescending, which is so easy in the  parent/child relationship.  <br />Although there may be other fine books that  also give great advice in this area, this book stands out in that the  advice is perceived visually, and it is fun, which may make theinformation  more retainable.  A great book and easy to read.	2000-07-05

The products are then listed with a summary of  its ingredients in up to fifteen categories.  The entire content of the  food is then rated with a &quot;gloom&quot; factor, which tells you how bad  or good the item is in comparison with other fast foods.  This is a good  quick-reference feature for those who have no idea whatsoever about what  they are looking for in a food.  The book also has an alphabetical listing  of the same restaurants with the actual ingredients of their food items.   This can be very useful for those who have certain dietary restrictions and  need to ascertain specific ingredients in their food.  In the front section  of the book there are listings of foods that are the highest in saturated  fats, cholesterol, and sodium, for example, and there are also listings for  food lowest in fat, and the fiber content of foods.  <br />In general the book  is quite useful, although it may be outdated.  Since foods change every so  often in fast food restaurants, you may not be able to find the specific  item that you are looking for.  For example, I could not find Wendy's  chicken nuggets (I have the 2nd edition - paperback, 1991) which is the  first item I get when I go to Wendy's.  But you can probably make an  educated guess by looking at some of the other foods that are similar.   This guide may eventually prove itself quite valuable since I don't see  many books that actually list the ingedients of popular fast foods.  Most  books tell you the protein/carb/fat content of one egg, 1 cup of corn  flakes, 1 slice of wheat toast, etc., and are suited only for those who are  going to prepare their own meals all the time.	2000-06-26

This book is really my first taste of a Messianic devotional and I really enjoy the flavor, although I concede that it may be an acquired taste.  Like most devotionals, it has short daily readings that help you to think  about Godly things and about how you are doing in your spiritual walk with  the Lord.  What sets it apart is that all 22 authors are leaders in the  Messianic movement.<br />The authors consistently use the Hebrew (or Yiddish,  etc.) terms for many words that we have translated into English, thereby  losing some of the meaning and &quot;feel&quot; of the chosen word from the  original language.  But not to worry, they are usually translated for you  right there so that you still understand everything that is being said.   This constant saturation with the more meaningful proper terms helps you to  feel closer to the Jewish people and understand their thought process  better.  Also, interjected into some of the readings are historical  accounts or other information that would only normally be known by persons  with a Jewish background, which further helps us to acquire an educated  knowledge of their culture. <br />Other features include the Hebrew calendar  date in bold display at the top corners of each page and the corresponding  Gregorian calendar dates below, up through the year 2004.  The names of the  writers do not appear on each page which really helps you to concentrate on  the teaching and to give glory to God and not to the man who wrote the  particular piece.  However, the individual authors' initials do appear in  small fine print at the bottom so that you can look them up in the index at  the front of the book.  The index, by the way, gives a brief profile of  each author, which will also help you to get a feel for who is who in the  Messianic movement around the world.  There is a small sidebar for listing  prayer requests and there is also a thought of the day (Today I will...) to  make the teaching practical at the bottom of each page.  An inspirational,  educational, practical, and handsome book.	2000-06-24

While it goes deep enough to satisfy your intellectual appetite, it really is more focused on giving you a resource for teaching and preaching, rather than  giving you ammunition for your next doctoral thesis.  In other words, it is  highly practical and written for the average reader.  This does not mean  that serious students have nothing to gain from it.  Far from it.  But the  goal of most students is to eventually be able to better share their faith  with others and this commentary could be a very useful tool in that  respect.  <br />Before many sections of the book there is a &quot;Preaching  Focus&quot;, and what would normally be called exegetical notes are called  &quot;Notes for Preaching and Teaching.&quot;   There are introductions to  important sections and there are also helpful notes at the end of several  sections.  All in all, a very practical teaching resource organized in  verse by verse commentary form.	2000-06-24

I suppose that if we argue that the author is biased in this book, we should argue that he is biased in favor of a biblical theology of angels and demons.  Yes, it is true.  His opinions may not be completely in  accordance with those who do not have a bible-based background.  However,  for those of you who do, you will find this a well researched and  documented volume.  The author walks you through virtually all of the basic  biblical theories concerning the spritual realm.  In addition, he not only  supports all of his positions with scripture so you can verify things for  yourself, but he also refers to extra-biblical literature as well.  Where  the author has a particular opinion of a controversial theory, he is  consistent in providing biblical evidence for his position.  <br />This is a  highly readable book, written for the layman, yet covers just about all the  theology you need to know on this subject.  The book is presented in a  question and answer format, which makes it easy to use it as a reference  tool to look up just the information about the specific questions you may  have.  If you are seeking more in-depth knowledge on the subject, it is  still useful as a reference because it lays out all of the major theories  on the subject, although I would not stop here.  You should read as many  books on the subject as possible.  All in all, it answers just about every  question you will probably need to know as a layman, and then some.	2000-06-20

It seems to have just the right balance of technical information and spiritual insight.  While it comments on each and every verse, it is not written for heavy-duty  scholars.  Written in a easy-to-read style, it clues you into the history  and culture that were unique to each situation, and the thought process  that was taking place in the minds of the participants in the accounts.  It  gives you a lot of information that you will simply not get from the gospel  account alone, but that is essential to arrive a more informed  understanding of the text.  <br />One of the main premises of this commentary  is the notion that there is progression of belief.  The author does a good  job in demonstrating this while at the same time maintaining the continuity  of interpretation and focus on each passage.  The book also provides a  detailed outline of each chapter and homiletical suggestions to aid those  who teach or preach.  The author is also conscious to convey practical  application so as not to let the book become just an intellectual exercise.   This is a good reference for the layman who may need just a little bit  more technical information than a strictly inspirational commentary will  give him, but who also does not need the frustration of trying to decipher  the exegetical tangents of some theological giant.	2000-06-20

Some of the other books that I had tried to read on the endgame just seemed too darn  difficult for beginners.  The difficulty was that there was just so much  information to memorize.  Pandolfini's book made the memorization of the  themes much easier by giving each technique a catchy name.  Then, you are  led step by step to more complicated techniques by successively building  upon the ones you have just learned.  This is good pedagogy.  I would  recommend this to any beginner to get a good understanding of what you need  to know to play the endgame.	2000-06-14

I had a whole library of chess books - so many in fact, that in all likelihood I would never have finished studying them all.  I gave most of them to my  daughter's elementary school  for their library since they were teaching  the kids how to play chess, and I kept just a few of the ones I felt were  the most useful and important.  This is one I kept.  The great thing is,  you don't have to read it.  You won't have to try to follow the gazillion  alternate moves of some grandmaster in your already overloaded brain.  You  just play the book as you would play an opponent, only you get a clue as to  how you are going to do him in.

There are no fancy boxes with a lot of small print inside, or so many  explanations that you can't find the verb.  This is a no-frill, look-em-up,  you-got-it kind of reference.  It is extensive enough to satisfy most  students (and even some native speaking professors!)  Yet it does not go so  deep that you have to finish the novel before you get the conjugation that  you only have 10 seconds to look up for your work.  <br />Contrary to the  opinion that the work is only good for people who need to see a few hundred  AR verbs fully conjugated, most students learn faster and retain the  knowledge better when they hear, SEE, and write the information they are  learning.  It IS important to see the verbs conjugated because then they  are reatined better in your memory.  What would you remember better, a  description of a beach in Hawaii, or a picture of it?  This book is not  just for slow students, it's for every learner or reviewer.  If you have  outgrown the need for this book, don't buy it, or get one that goes more  deeply into the subject.  But let's not confuse our own needs with the  value of this book.  By the way, this one can still fit into your purse or  briefcase.	2000-06-11

You can easily use it as a reference to the proper usage of specific verbs since all of the entries are in alphabetical order.  There is no guessing  on correct usage of verbs because there are several examples of each verb  in context, and it also  shows you how some of the verbs change meaning in  different contexts.  The English translation is given in a parallel line  just below the examples so you are not racking your brain to figure out  some of the more unusual or idiomatic examples.  <br />When I practice Spanish  I usually take a small section and read each sentence out loud and slowly,  until I can repeat it comfortably, and I do the same with each example.  It  will benefit you much more if you actually vocalize the examples unless you  are planning on never speaking the language.  Each time you practice with  different sections you are adding to your arsenal of usable phrases.  And  the more you practice, the more you start to &quot;loosen up&quot; your  tongue to be able to produce the sounds involved.  Most of the phrases  sound a bit formal, but you can be guaranteed that you will be using the  verbs correctly and more fluently than before.	2000-06-11

Not only is it quite easy to locate the word in  question because the book is arranged in the order of the New Testament,  but you can also be sure that the definition of the word is the intended  meaning for your specific phrase, and not just a general meaning that might  not be appropriate.  Knowing how to read Greek is definitely recommended,  but you can get around that if necessary by simply looking up the word from  your Bible in Strong's Concordance.  A very handy and useful tool.	2000-06-10

It contains the basic left-hand voicings used by jazz piansts  written out in every key and gives you a number of patterns that you can  use with your left hand.  Perhaps due to it being written by someone who  teaches at a great classical music school, the chord symbols emplyed are  the same as those used in classical music.  For example, instead of  indicating a minor seven flat five chord, he will use the classical symbol  for a half-diminished seventh chord, which may not be understood by someone  who does not have any classical background.  Also, the tunes that are  included for practice have no melodies written out,  so you either have to  already know them, or you will have to find a fake book or a recording that  has them.  Explanations also tend to be fairly technical, so a musician who  is really into playing but not too much into theory will not dig it very  much.  But the redeeming value is that there is a lot of material that is  written out, so if you can read music, you can benefit from this book.	2000-06-10

Even though I had read through the verb conjugations in books several times it still seemed as though I was making terribly slow  progress.  This book definitely helped me to reach a new plateau.  There  simply is nothing that will help you to memorize the conjugations better  than writing them out.  This book is arranged so that once you have a verb  form under your belt, you then learn a new one and keep reviewing the ones  that you have already done.  In this way, when you have finished even half  of the book you are already quite confident in your knowledge of the  conjugations.  By writing out the verb forms for even a portion of the book  you will have the skills necessary to produce your own conversation and  gain fluency, which is your main goal at this point.  If you are trying to  re-learn Spanish after a long break in studying, this book will be of  immense value.  Put this seemingly simple book at the top of your list for  Spanish educational materials.	2000-06-10

Just as beginners all need to learn to say phrases like, &quot;the sky is  blue&quot; etc., intermediate and advanced learners also have priorities at  those more advanced skill levels that are just as important.  Are you be  able create phrases like, &quot;She stood me up&quot; or &quot;He swindled  me&quot; or &quot;I don't want to put you out?&quot;  Would you be able to  understand them if they were spoken to you?  Many of the problems with  learning idiomatic expressions can be remedied with this book.  It is  basically broken down into three sections - 1) verbs, including common  idiomatic expressions; 2) more common expressions utilizing the verbs you  have learned, plus synonyms and antonyms; and 3) very slangy expressions,  or modismos.  This book is for anyone, beginner to advanced, who really  wants to learn Spanish as it is really spoken.	2000-06-10

It is the author's opinion that the Majority Text, or Textus  Receptus, is made up basically of 5th through 14th century copies of this  recension, and therefore the text does not represent the original wording  of the Greek New Testament.  The author argues that the concept that the  church loses the original Word of God and then recovers it falls in line  with the biblical concept of recovery.<br />This thesis is, of course,  contrary to that of the proponents of the Majority Text, who believe that  God has always preserved a true rendering of his Word throughout the entire  church age.  Majority Text proponents feel that there is either not enough  evidence to support the idea of a fourth century recension, or they feel  that thousands of manuscripts should not be summarily dismissed as evidence  simply on the grounds that some (or many) believe there was a fourth  century recension.<br />The author argues for the superiority of the  Alexandrian text over the Lucian text and feels that those older  (Alexandrian) manuscripts be given more weight than the erroneous, though  more numerous, majority Text manuscripts.<br />The author's viewpoint is  well argued and although a knowledge of Greek would be definitely  advantageous to a study of this book, its main points can be easily  understood even with no language background.  Recommended reading.	2000-06-09

The book is absolutely full of outstanding advice and is written so that  the average reader can comprehend it.  One of the areas that I was  especially impressed with was the keen insight on life insurance.  Yes,  dull, boring life insurance.  If you are still into any type of whole or  universal life policy, you need to read this book.  If you are planning  your finances, I believe there are many books out there that are fine, but  this is one of the few that really gives proper attention to a very  important part of your financial picture.  It is out of print right now,  but if you can get your hands on a copy, the info is still quite relevant  for today's readers.	2000-06-09

It is heads and shoulders above other books on the  subject and it was so intersting that I probably read it cover to cover in  a day or two.   The advice is extremely practical and you are learning  great principles of selling.  You are not learning a bunch of closing  dialogues that only work for the person who invented them.  Easily  digested, the principles allow you to adjust your approach in mid-sale  because you are asking questions whose answers will tell you what you need  to do or say next (positioning.)  Tons of great info here.  It should  really be a textbook for sales classes.	2000-06-09

I had heard that it was the standard  text and that everybody should have one.  Well, after reading through a few  pages I found that it was just too laborious.  I needed a lot of useful,  authoritative information and I needed it fast.  Extra time for studying  was not very easy to come by, and the book was going to need a whole lot of  extra time to wade through it.  So I never used it again while I was in  school.  I much rather preferred our classroom text - Music Theory: A  Syllabus, by Ellis B. Kohs.  Now this is a great text book.  It gets right  to the point and gives you exactly what you need to know to succeed.  It is  interesting that Mr. Kohs actually studied with Piston and also with Willi  Apel (Harvard Dictionary of Music.)<br />While the book may be quite useful, I  would not recommend it for first year theory students, which is what it is  normally used for.  If you are wondering, the Kohs book actually laid a  very good theoretical foundation for me as I was able to score in the top  3% on the theory portion of the graduate record exam in music.  (I also  later studied with Kohs so I guess I am a little biased in that respect.)  However, it is now unfortunately out of print, but if you can get a copy of  it, do it.  It's a much easier read.	2000-06-06

There is nothing like reading devotional stories from the experiences of real live missionaries.  In the tradition of &quot;Streams In The Desert&quot; these contemporary missionaries (also from OMS International)  share their intimate thoughts with you in the form of short stories.  I  suppose that I am biased in that I did know a few of these missionaries  personally, but the stories really give you a realistic understanding of  what missionaries go through and how they think.  So if you would like to  know just what goes through the minds of missionaries, and if you would  like to learn more about how God loves and cares for his flock, this would  be a fine addition to your library.	2000-06-05

Instead of taking a semester class in music copying, why not get this book?   It is the clearest and easiest to use manual on music notation that I have  ever seen.  You will find the information you need quickly and you will see  immediate improvement in the quality of your scores.  Believe me, composers  and arrangers need all the help they can get.  Sometimes musicians won't  even play your whole notes unless they look just right, honest!  With the  new computer programs you may not have that particular problem, but the  same issue arises as when a non-musician writes music at his computer.   Someone writes a violin piece in bass clef, nobody knows how to bow it, and  the number of beats per measure does not match the time signature.  The  computer can sure write pretty notes, but you still have to know how to put  them together properly.	2000-06-05

The entries are unsurpassed so far as classical music is concerned, but I did have to look for other resources when I needed accurate indepth  information on jazz or popular music.  It would be difficult in this day  and age to have one all-encompassing reference on every musical style in  existence, so I think that the work stands on its own and may dilute its  effectiveness if it were to overextend itself by trying to accomodate  everybody.  As a former composition student and someone who scored in the  top 3% on the music theory portion of the graduate record exam, I  wholeheartedly recommend this dictionary.	2000-06-05

Although the author is not interested in critisizing biblical  theology itself, he is interested in critisizing certain methods used in  the handling of linguistic evidence used in theological discussion.  This  book is a critique on those interpretive methods.<br />In biblical  interpretation there exists not only the problem of translation, but also  the problem of transculturation, which means we must consider the gaps  between not only a Semitic language, an Indo-European language (Greek), and  our own modern language, but also the gaps between the Ancient Near East,  the Roman Empire, and our own modern culture.  The author observes that it  is doubtful that any other sphere of life other than the theological has so  many people without special training who continually attempt a semantic  transference across such gaps.<br />While the author assumes that the reader  will have a basic understanding of Hebrew and Greek, he actually writes  more to &quot;the middle of the road&quot; in order to reach as wide an  audience as possible, and is neither overly technical nor too simplistic.  As such, even those who have no training in the biblical languages will be  able to benefit from reading it.  For instance, the chapter on contrast of  Hebrew and Greek thought, which is quite informative, uses no foreign  terms.<br />This book, which was first published in 1961, has withstood the  test of time, and the interpretive knowledge contained within its pages is  just as pertinent today as when it was first written.  This is a classic  study and should be required reading for serious students of the Bible.	2000-06-03

While it is written from a dispensational point of view, it was encouraging to get to chapter four and not find that John's summon into  heaven is automatically interpreted as being the rapture of the church.  (For me, this particular interpretation has always been so obviously  strained that it is embarrasing to me when folks actually try to preach it  from the pulpit.  It is also the farthest thing from a literal exegesis  that you can get, in a place that does not even  require a symbolic  interpretation.)<br />Almost all of the major opinions and arguments pro and  con for each passage are cited along with their respective proponents and  they are presented with great precision and scholarship.  Although the  author definitely has his own point of view, he is careful to write in a  manner that at least comes across on paper as being fair and impartial to  the reader.<br />Even though the exegesis is scholarly, it is not written to  such a technical extreme that no one but a PhD can understand it.  On the  contrary, it is quite accessible to the average reader, yet has enough  &quot;meat&quot; for anyone intersted in an indepth study.  In short, you  will enjoy reading it.  This volume along with its companion volume on  chapters 8-22 by the same author would be a highly prized addition to your  library.	2000-06-03

A man who lived in the times of the cultural revolution in China, who at one time lived quite well and had servants, but who later would lose everything  that he loved including his sister and brother.  And his Russian refugee  sweetheart Nadia would flee the country.  It is the story of a man who  unjustly spent 7 years in a prison cell no wider than you could spread your  arms along with three other men, who slept every night sardine style with a  toilet bucket by his head.  He had only a bowl of rice a day, which he  would put water into to give it the illusion of fullness.  When the  propaganda announcements came over the loudspeaker everyday he would sing  his Christian hymns under the noise so that even those who knew him  wondered if he had become a communist.  This is the story of man who would  then spend another four years on a prison farm after being released from  prison - a prison farm that killed his brother.  This is the story of a man  of great conviction and courage who waited his entire life for the Lord to  bless him and use him.<br />But the story does not end where the book ends.   After graduating from seminary - dream that he waited his entire adult life  to realize, he met his old sweetheart Nadia again, but she was married to  another man - she had received no word from Harry and had decided to get on  with her life.  But as only God knows why, her husband died and after her  grieving was completed she married Harry Lee.  So finally, after years of  waiting, he was reunited with his lost love.  But alas, during one of his  never-ceasing speaking engagements, Harry became ill, and he shortly  thereafter passed from this life to the next.  <br />I will always remember  Harry Lee as a softspoken gentleman who bore the marks on his body from the  nightly beatings that he suffered at the hands of the communists.  I will  remember him as the missionary who happened to come intotown when I was  befriending some teenage Chinese Acrobats and that he gave me tracts to  give to them.  But what I remember most is that he was the epitome of what  we all strive to become in our walks with the Lord.  May his story richly  bless you.	2000-06-03

It will give you a little more depth than Vine's, and the entry titles are written  in Greek so that you can practice recognition of the alphabet.  But don't  worry, you can still use this dictionary even if you do not know any Greek  because it also has an English translation reference index (also a win-win  situation, like Vine's.)  <br />It is coded to Strong's just in case you  really cannot find a particular word.  You can compare the definitions of  words with Vine's to get a second opinion, or you can just use it as a  stand-alone reference.  And not only are the words defined, but the author  also gives you a lot of background information on important or difficult  topics that you will not find in other dictionaries.  This Word Study  Dictionary, Strong's, a Bible Dictionary and Vine's will make an awesome  start for your library.  A ton of information here - a monumental work.	2000-06-02

With  those three volumes alone, you are quite able to dig in deeper into the  meanings of important or unfamiliar words and concepts, and you are well on  your way to having a solid foundation for your biblical study library.   <br />This newer edition is not only re-typeset so that it looks more modern  and is easier to read than older editions, but it also has a really great  feature - the entires you are looking up are not written in the original  languages - they are written in English!  Unlike other lexicons which  utilize entries only in the original tongue, Vine's does not even require  you to be able to read the entry in a different language, so as soon as you  get the book you can start looking up words and benefit from the wealth of  information that is contained inside.  The short articles give you a lot of  &quot;meaty&quot; and useful information but do not get bogged down in a  lot of technical jargon.  For those who prefer looking up the original  word, there is also a Greek word index (sorry no Hebrew) and several other  helps, so it is really a win-win situation.	2000-06-02

I used an earlier  edition of &quot;The Gospel Parallels&quot; in a college class about 19  years ago.  The fact that it is still a popular choice for serious study of  the gospels is a testimony to its great usefulness and enduring  scholarship.  This latest edition includes references to other canonical  writings that are not as accessible to all students, which makes it even  more valuable.  The footnotes have been enhanced, and all material that  appears &quot;out of order&quot; is printed in italics which is yet another  outstanding tool.  When I began to rebuild my personal library after having  sold or given away most of my books when I had moved, &quot;The Gospel  Parallels&quot; was very high on my list of essential references.  Highly  recommended.	2000-06-02

What I am not going to do here is tickle someone's ears and try to rack up points for one side of the issue or another.  But what I  would like to do instead is comment on whether or not I felt the book is  informative, useful, and helpful to Christians of all persuasions.  <br />To  supply a summary of the book would be redundant at this point since it has  already been done so well in the many comments below, by persons on all  sides of the question.  And although I may disagree with some of the  opinions in the reviews, I still had to admit that they were presented well  and were helpful to my knowledge and therefore I gave those reviews a yes  vote.  <br />Personally speaking, I find that I tend to pick on, or even  nitpick someone's theology when I am in actuality really upset with the way  that it was presented.  Perhaps the writer was not kind in the way that  they spoke of other Christians, or perhaps they even called them names.  Or  maybe they spoke as if persons having other viewpoints were ignorant, or  that they are false teachers.  All these things, which have more to do with  attitude and maintaining a Christian demeanor rather than theology, factor  heavily into my like or dislike of a book.  <br />I am convinced that we often  judge books by their covers (or author, or position, etc.) before we even  read the book.  We just don't have ears to hear at those times.  While it  is impossible to completely divorce your theological viewpoint from your  opinion of whether a book is good or not, there are many other factors that  we might consider.  I don't believe we should make the theological position  taken as our sole criterion for judging a person's work.  There are many  books out there that I agree with in principle, but are in fact poorly  written.  I truly enjoy the writing of authors with several different  backgrounds.  One of the commentators below received a lot of negative  votes simply because he said that he did not agree with the position taken,  however, he actually gave the book (if I recall correctly) 5 stars!  He was  very gracious in giving the book 5 stars although he did not agree with it,  and yet in return he received no mercy on the part of many of us whom I  assume are professing Christians (this might even cause you to examine your  thoughts on the possibility of carnal Christians.)  <br />When I was thinking  about this book, I asked myself questions such as, &quot;Did the book make  me think?&quot;, &quot;Did it cause me to search the scriptures more  diligently?&quot;  If it did, you are more likely stronger in your beliefs  (no matter what side) after reading it than before.  Does the author  maintain a professional and &quot;Chrisitan&quot; demeanor when presenting  his views?  Does he call anyone names, or speak condescendingly of  individuals with different points of view?  Does he demonstrate maturity of  thought?  Is the book well organized and easy to understand?  Are the  theological arguments strong or weak?   (This is different than asking,  &quot;Does he take my point of view?&quot;)  Is the book interesting -  could you put it down at anytime, or could you not wait to get to the end?   These are the kinds of questions I ask myself when I write an opinion of a  book.<br />No, I do not agree with everything Mr. Sproul says, even though he  is a much better theologian than I may ever be.  And yet, did I learn a lot  from reading the book?  Definitely!  Is my perspective larger than it was  before?  Of course it is.  Did I enjoy his style of writing?  Very much.   Is the book helpful to other Christians?  I think it could be.  <br />I feel  that giving an honest effort to understand what other brothers believe   (without stereotyping of course - everyone is still an individual) can help  us to bridge the gap in our differences.  We tend to fear what we don't  understand.  Once understood, we then maybe able to discuss our feelings  more productively - without being so emotional.  I recommend this book.	2000-05-31

The first few chapters are devoted to the history of both Christian and secular thought on the subject of angels.  The next few deal with our concepts of heaven.  Then, several more treat  the topic of daimons (demons), and the last essay attempts to tie them all  together into a cohesive doctrine.<br />The section that was by far the most  interesting to me was Peter G. Bolt's essay on &quot;Jesus, the Daimons,  and the Dead.&quot;  The writer argues that unlike today, where almost none  of us would think of interpreting the word &quot;daimon&quot; to mean the  spirit of a deceased person, to a first century audience, this would have  almost automatically have been interpreted to mean just that.<br />Mr. Bolt  cites numerous examples of this concept in Greco-Roman literature from  before, during and after the New Testament period.  He also shows how the  view fits well when interpreting passages involving daimons throughout  scripture.  The exorcisms in the book of Mark are then analyzed from this  point of view to show us what the implications would have been if the  audience had indeed viewed daimons as the spirits of deceased humans.  The  ramifications of course would be far-ranging to say the least if Mr. Bolt's  thesis is indeed correct.  A lot of thought provoking reading here.	2000-05-31

About two years ago I set out to lose weight and I lost 30 pounds, not with Atkins, but with supplements - thermogenics.   However, I really was in a &quot;diet&quot; frame of mind and I was really  starving myself.  I had pretty good will power and could fast for days,  etc.  But the trick is, of course, how to maintain your desired weight once  you get it off.  <br />Well, once I learned the &quot;secret&quot; of the  protein/fat versus carbs it was like a heavy burden was lifted from my  shoulders.  If you don't have any carbs to burn, guess what, you burn fat  instead (this is over-simplified.)  It was like when I was teaching a  friend of mine to play chess.  I told him if he ever got ahead by one piece  he should trade all of his remaining pieces.  He said, &quot;Why?&quot;  I  replied, &quot;Because when you are finished trading you will be one piece  ahead at the end and you can beat your opponent with that piece.&quot;  My  friend's face lit up like he had just been given the secret keys to some  harem.  And so it is with this book.  <br />A friend of mine at work who just  started to diet took this information from me by word of mouth and has lost  about 30 pounds in just about a month now combining this diet with weight  workouts and running.  It took me a year with the supplements.  But now I  eat more than ever and I don't feel hungry (because I am always eating.) I  still pig out on carbs now and then, which is a bad habit, but when I feel  myself gaining a few too many, I get back on the high protein and usually  withing the week I am back to where I was.  I believe in this diet.	2000-05-28

As a (former) accompanist, I can  tell you that the more you know about ballet the better you will do in  classes.  The book obviously is a great one or it would not have stood the  test of time, but let's face it, I really bought it because it has a sample  lesson at the end of the book that has music written out for each exercise!   I did not end up using that music, but it really gave me a better  understanding of what was going to take place in the class since I had  never accompanied before.  Musicians, do yourself a favor and buy the book.	2000-05-27

And since my first experience accompanying was for  the professionals at the Southern Ballet Theatre, I knew I was in big  trouble.  This little book helped me immensely with the terms, although I  still had tons of problems because I simply did not know what the steps  looked like until I saw them rehearsed.  For beginners, you are going to  need a few references to understand what the instructor is saying because  they simply don't have the time to give you private lessons while the rest  of the class waits.  I recommend this book for all those musicians who  haven't got a clue about the language of one of the most beautiful art  forms in existence.  Heck, I almost sound French when I use the  pronunciation guide.	2000-05-27

Next to your Bible, a concordance and a Bible dictionary are the two most likely candidates for serious students of the Word, and Strong's Exhaustive  Concordance is by far the most popular concordance, hands down.  Whenever I  do a study, you can be assured that I use the concordance to either look up  verses, find out how many times a word is used, or find the basic meaning  of a word in the original language.  As a concordance it is great, but for  word studies you will probably need a dictionary or lexicon that will give  greater detail in their definitions.  But this should not stop you from  purchasing the book, because almost all other modern references now use the  Strong's numbering system.  So, start with Strong's, use it as your  concordance and do use it for the basic definitions, but then as you  progress you can purchase other reference volumes that will give you more  information but will still utilize the same numbering system.  Although the  hardback is tremendous, I prefer the softcover edition.  It is not as large  and bulky, usually costs less, and it can fit inside of your briefcase.	2000-05-26

Being new at accompanying, I searched for books that would help me learn the movements for class.  Most  of them were small and technical or very large (and expensive) with lots of  photos of famous dancers.  When I found &quot;Ballet Steps&quot; I just  could not get over its beauty.  It is very instructional, yet the book is  an art in itself.  All of the illustrations are hand-drawn and really  convey the flow of movement and the elegance of the ballet.  The  author/illustrator based his drawings on photos of actual dancers perforing  their art, usually in the class. Since he would do the drawings later at  his own pace, he was able to make corrections to even the slightest  imperfection so we end up with an incredibly beautiful book.  The author's  aim was to help the dance student or the ballet-goer to understand the  language that ballet is based upon.  He not only achieved this but he  surpassed all of my expectations with this eye-inspiring volume.	2000-05-26

This is an excellent book to help you understand the basic theological differences between major doctrinal interpretations.  Instead of giving you &quot;unbiased&quot; commentary on each verse which is almost always, by  definition, slanted toward one side or another, the author simply gathers  together the main texts each side uses to prove their position.  This not  only helps you decide for yourself if you agree with any of them or not,  but it also trains you to recognize a good or bad argument when you hear  one.  <br />Since the different views must rely only upon the scriptures to  support them in this book, you begin to see which arguments are the  strongest biblically and which ones seem to be stretching the truth.  All  of the comparative doctrinal texts are placed in close proximity for easy  comparison.  You will learn a lot of theology (hopefully not just your own)  by simply reading this book.	2000-05-25

You cannot simply read a sentence and then  forget about it, or ignore it.  It forces you to make decisions about each  thought and to put your answer in writing.  It is written in a question and  answer format for all 22 chapters.  <br />On the downside, it is so long that  it may take you a year to really contemplate each question and to write  your answers, so it may be best suited as a classroom aid.  There is a good  amount of repetition of certain material, and it seems as though the  authors want to justify each and every statement made in the book.  While  this may be a noble task, it makes the book too long for the average reader  (well, for me anyway.)  I would like to see a more condensed version that  highlights the main critical thoughts and yet retains the comprehensiveness  that the authors were seeking.	2000-05-24

Mr.  Hagin begins with a brief overview of fasting in the Old and New Testaments  showing who fasted and why they fasted.  Then he explains the different  types of fasts, the reasons why we should or shouldn't fast, and what we  can expect to accomplish by fasting.  Two prominent themes in the book are,  &quot;fasting doesn't change God, but it does help make us more sensitive  to the Holy Spirit&quot; and, &quot;fasting without spending time with God  doesn't do much good.&quot;  This is good practical advice for all  believers.	2000-05-24

In short, the book teaches you how to have a victorious walk  with God by showing you how your spritual being operates.

It is understandable that many, including honest, God fearingChristians would have doubts about some of the things the authordescribes in the book.  And of course everyone has the right, and also the obligation to test the spirits, and to test whatever you hear from the pulpit or from any book claiming to report truth.  This much I am sure we can all agree upon.<br />While all the details in the book may not be entirely accurate according to your particular view of theology, I doubt if there is anyone out there who IS 100 percent accurate.  I do believe though that Rebecca Brown is telling the truth as she remembers it.  The accounts are not too far removed from other accounts from other satanists.  Perhaps we can hold onto the good and reject the bad, as the scritpures admonish us.  I believe there is a lot of good here.	2000-05-23

Though I no longer possess the book, I remember it as being extremely reader friendly and fairly  comprehensive covering virtually all of the major doctrines including  general/special revelation, sin, salvation, angels, and last things, etc.   It was, in fact, so easy to read and understand that I was able to finish  it in only a few days (although at that time I could read all night long.)   I believe it is supposed to be a sort of theological primer for its  companion volume, &quot;Christian Theology&quot; by the same author, which  is a more difficult read and goes into much greater detail.  Written from a  [Baptist] dispensational, premillenial, pretribulational viewpoint, it is  an excellent book with which to begin your theological studies.  The reader  will have a great deal of basic theology under his belt when he finishes  this book.	2000-05-23

But as I read through the book, I did not  find it as irreverent as I had expected.  In fact, I did not even find it  as disrespectful as some other fervently argued theological works.  Of  course there are several things the author could have done to make the book  sound more like objective reporting.  For instance, he might have simply  titled the book &quot;The Origin Of The Pretribulation Rapture&quot; to  sound less aggressive, etc.  We should keep in mind however that the author  is not known primarily as a theologian, and he does not write or sound like  one, so we should not judge the book as though it were written by one.  He  sounds more like a regular guy writing his thoughts down.  This may be  either refeshing or unbearable depending on your mind set.<br />One of the  things that we should also keep in mind is that the book, which is  comprised of two of his earlier works which were published in 1973 and  1974, is somewhat outdated so far as the &quot;cover-up&quot; theme goes.   Today in the year 2000, I don't think that there are many who have  seriously studied the pretribulation rapture who have not heard of Margaret  Macdonald.  It is not something that is kept as a secret.  My initial  thought was, what real difference does this information make to the theory,  since we have the facts of the theory and we need to check them out against  the authority of the scriptures anyway.  I do not hold to the pretrib  theory, and yet, I wonder why it is so important to know about an alledged  cover-up that took place 170 years ago.  Whatever the origin, we have the  theory, and we can judge it against scripture.  Paul says that some people  preach for money, but he thanks God that the Gospel is preached in everyway.  In other words, even if a not-so-honest person preaches the Word, it  does not negate the veracity of the Word.  Whether he is a sinner or a  saint, his moral or spiritual condition has no bearing on the actual  information that he is disseminating.  The same thing can be said of the  pretribulation rapture theory.  We need only judge the theoretical  information that is presented, not the presenter.<br />The book is divided  into two parts.  The first part deals with the origin of the pretrib  rapture theory (or the cover-up), while the second part has most of the  biblical argumentation.  For me, it is the second part that is the most  relevant and the most informative.  The author actually covers a great deal  of important and critical theology dealing with the pretrib and posttrib  positions from a posttrib perspective.  Some of the points are really  excellent, but I wish he would have expounded a bit more because he  virtually covers some very important points with single sentences.  Because  of this I am sure that some readers will miss the great significance of  some of those arguments.<br />In summary, I think the theological arguments  presented in the second part of the book stand on their own and make the  first cover-up part unnecessary.  The only reason I can see to include the  first part is to try to discredit the pretrib theory by virtue of its  origin, or to discredit its proponents by virtue of association.  I have no  doubt that the vast majority of the proponents of the theory are godly men  and women.   We should strive to keep our arguments to the theological  issues and not aimed at the personalities involved.	2000-05-22

In order to understand the freeness of our  salvation, the often neglected, yet vitally important concept of eternal  rewards must be correctly taught to the believer.  This issue along with  the issue of mistaking discipleship passages (works) for salvation (free  gift) passages - discussed in &quot;Absolutely Free&quot; by the same  author - make up the great bulk of misunderstood scripture which leads many  to combine both concepts into a single doctrine of salvation and ending up  with a (disguised) &quot;works salvation.&quot;<br />Hodges also maintains  that words such as &quot;believe&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; have basically  the same meaning that they do in English and that they are often  interpreted to say more than they actually do by well-meaning theologians  and lay-persons.  He cites several examples from scripture where the words  use their common meaning where it would be clearly erroneous to ascribe to  them extra meaning.  Many of these passages are the same ones used to  support the concept of works being a necessary result or fruit of one's  salvation.  <br />The concept of the total freeness of salvation contained in  the book often draws the accusation of &quot;antinominanism&quot; -  &quot;against law&quot; or &quot;lawless.&quot;  However, the author makes  clear in the book that a saved person is profoundly responsible for his  actions, and that there are consequences in the life to come for one's  disobedience in this life - which is clearly not advocating lawlessness,  but does teach the concept of eternal rewards.	2000-05-17

Together with &quot;Grace in Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;  by the same author, they form a sort of mini-commentary on numerous  difficult, misunderstood, and controversial New Testament passages.   &quot;The Gospel Under Seige&quot; was the first composed of the three  books and may be the most difficult to understand at times since it is  designed to address difficult passages head-on with commentary.  The other  two books seem to be  layed out in more of a lesson format with commentary  backup.  <br />Some of the argments may sound strange to your ears on first  hearing, largely because you may not have heard any of these arguments  outside of this book.  My suggestion is that you not read this you would  read a novel, but to consciously contemplate if what you have read is what  the scriptures actually say or not, putting away for the time being any  preconceived notions that you may have about the passage in question.  This  is akin to a scientist not writing the results of his experiment before he  actually performs the experiment.  (An honest scientist for example, would  not discount the possibility of miracles until he could prove that they do  not exist, etc.)<br />Please keep in mind that the author is a highly regarded  expert in the Greek language.  He has co-edited the majority text version  of the Greek New Testament and he has taught the subject for thirty years.   The nuances and technical points that he makes are not based on someone  else's work, they are based on his own, although he is careful to cite  other scholars who share his opinions to show that this is not individual  or unusual interpretation from a linguistic standpoint.<br />One of the  author's purposes in this trilogy is to demonstrate that the modern  Reformed position has changed its positions from those of the original  reformers from whom they derive their denominational name.  He cites  numerous references for these changes in the notes.  This is an important  point because many automatically assume that the modern Reformed position  is exactly that of the original reformers and they are not willing to  question their authority.  The author argues that the position he is  advocating is in actuality closer to that of the original reformers than  the modern Reformed position.<br />The book is quite instructional, and as the  author presents his analysis, he often shares insight on his hermeneutical  approach.  This information is instilled in the reader so that they too can  avoid some of the common interpetive pitfalls when they do their own  analysis.<br />But no matter what your particular view may be, the book is an  eye-opener, and highlights many linguistic details from the original  language that we simply cannot get from our English translations.  Even if  you do not agree with any or all of the author's interpretations, there is  a lot of detailed linguistic material that is brought to light to give us  cause for serious reflection.  Written by a complete gentleman (he even  took the time to speak with me over the phone at Redecion Viva), this is a  highly recommended, yet controversial book.	2000-05-13

He argues for a simple faith that needs no qualifiers, no contingencies, no long drawn out explanations of what faith  is, what precedes it, what follows it, or what accompanies it.  In short,  he argues for a true faith alone. Though well argued, many others just  cannot say &quot;faith alone&quot; and leave it at that - they must qualify  it somehow.  He argues that &quot;free&quot; means just that - free.  He  argues that a &quot;gift&quot; is just that - a gift, not something that we  have a coupon book for that we must keep on making payments for the rest of  our lives.  This is one author who has let his yes be yes and his no be no,  and for his integrity of conviction has suffered being called  &quot;Raca&quot; by many professing believers. <br />There are no offers of  salvation in the Bible that took 200 pages of text to deliver and  understand before they could be received.  Nor do any of the offers require  the recipient of the offer to have thorough knowledge of a complicated  theology that had not been invented yet.  They didn't even have to read a  copy of John or Romans (if they existed yet).  They were asked to believe,  and in that split second they either believed or they didn't.  Hodges  argues for a faith that is just that - faith (no qualifiers).<br />The  teaching is rather simple as he leaves the more technical debate for the  endnotes.  This allows the reader to simply grasp the ideas while at the  same time knowing that they can be backed up with solid  exegesis.<br />&quot;Absolutely Free,&quot; along with &quot;The Gospel Under  Siege&quot; and &quot;Grace in Eclipse&quot; by the same author form a sort  of mini commentary filled with verse by verse interpretation.  Numerous  difficult passages in the New Testament are expounded and the student will  grow greatly in his knowledge by reading them.  However you must read all  three of them toget the full picture of Hodges' theology as each book is  focused on a particular topic.  After reading all three you will notice  that the same themes repeat themselves throughout his writing.<br />If the  concept of &quot;faith alone&quot; is true and correct, then Hodges'  theology comes very close to defining it without changing its basic  meaning.  If we do not agree with Hodges, then perhaps &quot;faith  alone&quot; is not the correct term for what we truly believe.  We should  not deceive ourselves.  There are many books out there that do spend 200  pages of text trying to explain why &quot;faith alone&quot; really means  faith plus something else.  Hodges book just doesn't do that, so should we  fault him for that?  The book is both easy to read and to understand.  In  fact, it was an absolute joy to read.	2000-05-13

This book provides both.  <br />I discovered this book before my last  presentation and my delivery was immediately improved by using the  practical tips Mr. jeary provided in the book.  If you need to improve and  you need it in a hurry, you need this book.	2000-05-12

I wish I had seen this before I bought it.  What I was really looking for was some help for my public speaking skills.   The book really is a compendium of &quot;common sense&quot; that we should  use when we communicate with others.  We should have learned most of this  through our own life experience while interacting with others, but it is  all here in one convenient package so that we don't have to go looking  everywhere for this information.<br />Even though the book is entertaining and  it never purports to be the type of book that I was searching for, it  really did not tell me anything that I already didn't know.  It does give  advice on how to &quot;give a speech&quot; for example, but the advice is  too vague and not specific enough to be of great help (like,  &quot;legitimize your fear&quot;; &quot;illucidate you fear&quot;;  &quot;embrace your fear&quot;; &quot;the best way to make an impression is  by making the impression that you are not trying to make an  impression&quot;, etc.)  While the book is good so far as it goes and the  advice is true, I just did not see that it added much to most readers'  knowledge about the subject.  If you do need a book with lots of awesome  practical tips for public speaking then get Tony Jeary's &quot;Inspire Any  Audience&quot;.	2000-05-12

Sproul is an excellent writer and his work in this volume is no  exception.  It is very clear though it is highly partial to his own side.   But that is the point - he is presenting his own side (you are free to  write your own book).  You may not agree with every point (or with any  point!), but he does make the points well, and there is a certain  classiness and professionalism about his writing that sets him apart from  other contemporary writers.	2000-05-11

Though it is written by a master theologian, it is not difficult to read.  The major concepts are presented very clearly without the clutter of technical jargon and  arguments.<br />On the other hand, if you are looking for or need a verse by  verse exegetical commentary with all of the underlying arguments, this is  not the book for you.  While the book is layed out in the style of a  commentary, it was not the author's intention to show all of the reasons  behind each remark.  Again, if you need a commentary to help you determine  for yourself the meaning of certain controversial verses, this is not the  book for you - you need something more detailed.  <br />However, even though  it does not give the greatest exegetical detail, the introductory material  is very good, and the reader will benefit greatly from this.  The book  emphasizes the practical application for the believer and has numerous  commentary inserts scattered throughout like a devotional would have,  although the inserts tend to be more practical than inspiring.	2000-05-10

The author digs in deep to discover the biblical truths about angels.  One of the things that really impressed me was that  he touches upon  arguments for and against controversial issues such as the  gap theory, the pre-adamic race theory, the fallen angels versus demons  theory, and the 'Sons of God' theories.  The author goes into detail and  explains the &quot;why&quot; of each argument.   This is a fascinating book  on a subject that is often neglected.	2000-05-10

Because of its clear organization it is easy to read and makes difficult concepts easy to  understand.  <br />The book covers topics such as &quot;Jesus Christ Possesses  the Names and Titles of God&quot; and then proceeds to expound on each of  them one by one.  Other sections are entitled &quot;Jesus Christ Possesses  the Attributes of God&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Possesses the Authority  of God.&quot;  The author defines what the issues are and what is at stake.   He covers the witnesses of the early church and has a section on common  objections as well as on other views of the deity of Christ.  In addition  the author gives his testimony on how he discovered new life in Christ  through his extensive research in an attempt to discredit Christianity.   Intstead of finding out about a religion, he encountered a person - Jesus  Christ.  <br />The writing is very succinct and gives the reader a good review  of each argument using only the absolute essentials.  Because of his  writing style you get a large amount of quality information in a fairly  short book.  It is, however, much easier to read and finish than the  author's &quot;Evidence That Demands A Verdict&quot; which seems more like  trying to read through a whole encyclopedia in comparison.  <br />The student  of the Word will find virtually all of the major arguments for the deity of  Christ distilled into bitesize bits that will not require a degree in  theology to comprehend.  After reading this book I felt very satisfied in  the quality teaching that I had received and the short amount of time that  was required to invest.  If you have not studied the deity of Christ before  you will advance your knowledge by leaps and bounds by studying this little  book.	2000-05-09

Es una obra teologica de gran importancia que esforzo la comunidad evangelica reevaluar su escatalogia porque sale a luz  mucha evidencia clara que todavia esta aumentando.  Las librerias  cristianas estan lleno de publicaciones recientes que tratan de las teorias  mayores porque sienten el impacto de las ensenazas de este libro y quieren  defenderse.  La teoria ya esta ensenado en todo el mundo y los partidarios  estan creciendo en numero.<br />Ensena una sequencia de eventos del tiempo del  fin que no estan de acuerdo con las teorias mayores pero si, estan de  acuerdo con las escrituras y la interpretacion es mucho mas natural que los  demas.  Simplemente, los Cristianos van a pasar por la Gran Tribulacion,  pero van a ser raptado antes que la ira de Dios esta derramado sobre la  tierra - exactamente lo que las escrituras prometen.<br />Cuando la sequencia  del Dia del Senor esta determinado, que es my facil ver por las escrituras,  entonces todos los demas eventos caen en su lugar muy naturalmente, sin  torcer ningun texto.<br />El libro es largo y tarda mucho leerlo, pero vale la  pena.  Si usted esta interesado solamente en aprender la cronologia del  rapto, le aconsejo leer &quot;El Rapto&quot; por el mismo autor.  Mientras  &quot;La Senal&quot; trata de muchas areas de escatalogia, &quot;El  Rapto&quot; esta enfocado en solamente el rapto.<br />Quizas hay algunos  puntos menores con que usted no esta de acuerdo, pero en cuanto a la  cronologia de los eventos del tiempo del fin, yo creo que el autor ha  descubierto la llave al acertijo y nos ha dirigido a todos nosotros en la  direccion correcta.<br />This book is the achievement of a lifetime for the  late Robert Van Kampen.  It is a pivotal theological work that forced the  evangelical community to re-evaluate their eschatology in light of still  mounting clear evidence.  One need only look at the myriad of new books on  &quot;older&quot; theories that are inundating the bookstores to see the  impact that this work has had - they all need to come to terms with it.  It  is already taught all over the world, and has a rapidly growing  following.<br />It advances a sequence of endtime events (most notably the  rapture) that simply did not match any of the major theories but was  completely biblical and is a more natural interpretation of the scriptures  than any of the others.  In a word, Christians will go through the Great  Tribulation by Antichrist, but they will be raptured before the wrath of  God is poured out upon the earth - exactly what was promised.<br />When the  sequence of the Day of the Lord is determined in the chronology of endtime  events - which is quite easy to see from scripture - then all of the other  events fall into place naturally with no straining or twisting of any text.  <br />The book is long however, and it will take a while to read all the way  through, but it definitely will be worth it.  If you are interested only in  learning about the timing of the rapture, you should read &quot;El  Rapto&quot; by the same author.  &quot;La senal&quot; is a broad based work  touching upon many eschatologal areas, whereas &quot;El Rapto&quot; is  focused solely on the rapture.  <br />While there may be some &quot;jots and  tittles&quot; that need more refining, or that you simply don't agree with,  I believe the author has hit the nail on the head as to the chronology of  the endtime events and has pointed us all in the right direction.	2000-05-08

La teoria presentada en este libro nos da una  repuesta mas que satisfactoria por todos los problemas que encontramos en  TODAS las teorias del rapto.  El libro es facil leer, logico, conciso, y el  comentario es el mas natural que he encontrado.  Este es uno de solamente  dos libros que conozco que trata de esta teoria que estan traducido en  espanol.  La otra es &quot;La Senal&quot; por el mismo autor, Robert Van  Kampen.  El enfoque de &quot;El Rapto&quot; concentra solamente en el  rapto, mientras &quot;La Senal&quot; cubre todos los aspectos del  escatologia y es mas dificil terminar porque es tan largo.  Le aconsejo  fuertemente leer &quot;El Rapto&quot; si quieres encontrar la respuesta mas  correcta de los problemas del rapto.<br />Almost everyone I know of was taught  only one theory regarding the rapture - the pre-tribulational rapture  theory.  But I had always had questions and problems with this theory that  no one could answer adequately.  The theory presented in this book gives us  the most satisfactory response to the problems that we find in ALL of the  rapture theories.  The book is easy to read, logical, concise, and provides  the most natural commentary that I have found.  This is one of only two  books that I know of that teach this theory and that are translated into  Spanish.  The other is &quot;La Senal&quot; by the same author, Robert Van  Kampen.  the focus of &quot;El Rapto&quot; concentrates solely on the  rapture, whereas &quot;La Senal&quot; covers all aspects of eschatology and  is more difficult to read because it is so long.  I strongly recommend  reading &quot;El Rapto&quot; if you want to find the most correct response  to the problems of the rapture.	2000-05-07

It is in our best interest to have iron sharpen iron.  When we  stretch ourselves and earnestly seek to understand what others believe, we  are heading in the right direction.  Having an understanding of what our  brothers believe can also promote trust and peace between us.  When we seek  peace we are sewing to our spirit.  This book is an excellent tool to help  us understand not only the facts about what others think, but also many of  the why's.  <br />Even though I have been studying eschatology for quite a few  years now, I find that I am still quite a novice when it comes to theories  outside of my own particular area of expertise.  The book serves to help  fill that gap in my general knowledge.  For one thing, I just now learned  that there is a controversy as to the dating of the book.  And even though  I am not persuaded in this instance to change my stance, the mere fact that  there is a controversy, would make one of my previous review comments sound  very ignorant.  (Don't worry, when you find it, just click the &quot;no'  button - I would too now.)<br />While it may be almost impossible to be  completely objective in writing this kind of book, the author does a fine  job of it.  No matter what your particular view is, you owe it to yourself  to find out what other godly men and women think.  The book is fair and  makes no attacks on any individuals or position, which, in my book, is the  mark of a good writer.  To me, attitude has a lot to do with whether I like  a book or not.<br />The book is dedicated to Chuck Smith, pastor of Calvary  Chapel in Costa Mesa, California, with whom I also have had a chance to  study.  It becomes apparent that the author does not maintain the same view  as Pastor Smith, but at the same time he shows respect and admiration for a  truly fine brother.  I, on the other hand, do not hold the same exact view  as either of them, but I still regard the book as a valuable resource.   Just as their particular view of this &quot;peripheral&quot; theology  really has no bearing on what kind of Christians they are, so too, our own  personal biases should not come to bear on whether or not this is a good  book - it just is.	2000-05-07

He then walks you through various  situations, using insightful questions and examples to help us arrive at  the meaning of a text, using &quot;the whole counsel of God.&quot;  While  it is not meant to be a systematic treatment of the subject, it is well  organized and is suitable for both the layman and scholar.	2000-05-06

According to the author, all three should be viewed together as a comprehensive whole in order to  arrive at a proper understanding of our salvation, since they are  intimately related to each other throughout the scriptures.<br />Written from  a dispensational point of view, Lightner lays everything out in easy to  understand terms, and in a format that is easily accessible when used as a  reference.  He covers all the bases and does include brief commentary on  some controversial issues such as Lordship salvation, and eternal security.  He is courteous in his writing and although he does mention some  particular individuals by name, he is careful not to engage in reckless  polemic.<br />You will find his writing clear, well organized, and refreshing.  Written in non-technical terms, and geared to the general reader,  &quot;Sin, the Savior, and Salvation&quot; is a solid reference volume and  I highly recommend it.	2000-05-05

It is also  an excellent study tool for students on both sides of the question who  would like to learn more about the doctrine of eternal security.  <br />The  thing I like best about this book is that it gets you to think about the  implications of each individual verse that you study.

The book is not directed against any particular person or school of thought, nor is it adovcating any particular praise or worship style in church.  Rather, its purpose is  to bring us to the realization that worship is more about the way we live  our daily lives and less about what we do on Sunday mornings.  <br />We cannot  truly worship what does not exist, so MacArthur provides us with a very  quick overview of the reasons men believe God to exist.  And since we  cannot effectively worship who we do not know, he also teaches us about the  attributes of God.  And since we want to worship God the way He would like  to be worshipped, we are also instructed in the right and wrong ways that  God has been worshipped in the Bible, showing us the consequences of  improper worship, and the blessing that comes from proper worship.<br />There  is no fluff here; you will not read about the author's personal warm and  fuzzies, but you will get solid biblical scholarship.  If you're the kind  of person who finds satisfaction and joy in simply studying the word, and  learning more about our wonderful God, then you will be very satisfied  indeed.	2000-04-29

Right from the outset, when we first met, he got the impression that I was suffering from some kind of curse, without even  having spoken to me at any length.  I was ministering in worship and praise  at the time (which I still do) and I didn't pay too much attention to what  he said until I read through this book.  <br />I had felt for the longest time  though (for the last 15 years or so), on numerous occasions that my family  and I had experienced a great deal more of &quot;unlucky&quot; calamity,  sickness, and financial failure than most of the people around us.  The  book lists, among other things, numerous objects that can be doorways for  the occult or idolatry to enter into our lives.  Boy was I surprised when  the pastor showed me that the papyrus I used for educational purposes had  the image of a musician (symbolically me) making an offering on an altar to  the highest god of Egypt!  From then on, my wife and I went through the  house and we were amazed at the number of objects that we found.  We  decided to burn them in the back yard.<br />The book speaks in depth on  self-imposed curses that we bring upon ourselves through our speech, and  also covers family, or hereditary curses that were handed down to us  through our ancestors.  If you don't believe in hereditary curses you might  want to ask yourself why the doctor's office always has you fill out a form  telling them what diseases your parents and grandparents had.<br />The  question of course is, if Christ redeemed me from &quot;the curse of the  law&quot; why would I still need to break any curses in my life?  Good  question.  Another question to ask yourself could be, if God forgave my  sins, why am I still in jail, or why am I still suffering the consequences  of my sin, or even my father's sin?  I will leave you to read the book to  get the author's point of view on this.<br />This is a highly practical as  well as informative book.  It has definitely left an impression upon my  thinking.  For those of you who have even the slightest doubt that you may  be suffering from a curse, please read this book, and learn how you can be  set free from its power.	2000-04-28

One of my former pastors  used to have a saying - &quot;if you are not willing to love a person, you  have no right to correct that person.&quot;  <br />When I read this book  several years ago, I remember taking notes, and having found some type of  criticism of someone on at least 300 pages of the text.  My question was,  did the author bring enough oil and bandages to annoint and wrap the wounds  that he inflicted with the Sword of the Spirit?  Without the Love of God,  do we have the right to wield the Sword of God?  <br />While I do not agree  with the author on every point, he does do a good job in bringing to our  attention the abuses of spiritual gifts that can occur in the church and  our need for better discernment.

This book is an excellent tool to broaden your thinking as to the various ways in which Christians view the seemingly contradictory biblical truths of God's sovereignty and human free will.  <br />When I first read the book, perhaps a dozen or so years ago, it really opened up my eyes as to the  complexity and profoundness of the issue.  Here we have four Christian  scholars, each with a  brilliant mind, who present their positions  logically and convincingly, and yet, are unable to reach a consensus  between them.  When such apt erudites have difficulty agreeing on certain  issues we shouldn't be surprised that the average Christian is puzzled as  well.<br />It seemed to me that each author took hold of a particular aspect  of the total revealed truth, and clung to it tightly, and gave it more  weight or emphasis than the other aspects.  And interestingly enough, each  was able to argue their case persuasively using the scriptures and  philosophical arguments.  The comments of each author on the essays of the  others revealed strengths and weaknesses of the arguments for each  position.  This really hit home and convinced me of the overwhelming  complexity of the issue and why we should not be dogmatic in our assertions  on this subject.<br />Before I read the book, I think I may have had an idea  as to what I believed about the sovereignty of God and what its  relationship is to human free will.  But after reading it, I was really  left with the impression that perhaps our finite minds really are incapable  of fully comprehending this profound truth - that perhaps, God's thoughts  truly are that much higher than our own.  It really had a humbling effect,  which I believe is good.  Perhaps there is a higher common denominator that  has not yet been discovered or revealed where these seemingly opposing  truths can be reconciled.  I do feel however that when we dogmatically  emphasize a particular aspect of the entire revealed truth we tend to  polarize ourselves from other brothers to whom God may have chosen to  reveal a different aspect of his truth.<br />For ages, contemplative believers  accepted both ideas as biblical truth and just lived with the tension  between the two.  But for those who just could not live with the tension,  we have created for ourselves several ingenious theologies which explain  things from basically one perspective to make it easier for our minds to  grasp.<br />Without a doubt, I am certainly not an expert on this issue.  But  after a good deal of thought, for me, it still remains a mystery of God -   something too high for me to fully understand, so I decided for myself to  make no dogmatic conclusions.  Perhaps I will feel differently about this  later, but the book did have this infuence on me.<br />My hope is that the  book opens up the minds of the readers so that they may be more  understanding of their brothers who may feel differently than they do, and  foster an attitude of grace, mercy, acceptance and love.  This is a very  thought provoking book.	2000-04-26

It reads like a history book in some places and like a textbook in others.  There are no dogmatic assertions made for any position, and the  author's own opinion is well hidden -- you do not even know what it is  until the end of the book.<br />The book covers a great deal of material  including overviews of the traditional viewpoints of the millenium and the  timing of the rapture.  It includes basic arguments from each position and  the persons who are the spokesmen for those positions.  One of the  prominent features is that evaluations are given of both positive and  negative aspects of each position which is a big plus.  While the arguments  do not go into the greatest detail, they are not unduly brief so as to be  unuseful.  The scholar as well as the layman will find the book  inviting.<br />Although the book is a newer addition and covers the recent  trends in dispensationalism for example, it does not have information about  the prewrath rapture position, which is becoming a major theory.  It does  however cover some of the less popular, or &quot;mediating&quot; positions  such as the partial rapture view and the imminent posttribulational  view.<br />This is a very informative and well written book.  The author is  quite fair to all positions and never engages in personal attacks.  The  book was written at the request of seminary students for an objective  reference to the different eschatological options they would have when they  would someday minister.  Written by a scholar with the heart of a minister,  their request has been well served in this book.	2000-04-24

Was it just a coincidence that the four spring feasts of the Lord were fulfilled prophetically during the first coming of Christ?  Howard and Rosenthal show us how the feasts of the Lord were God's appointed times to  meet with man for holy purposes, and how having an understanding of the  prophetic fulfillment of each feast will clue us in to where we stand in  God's prophetic calendar.  Written from a Jewish-Christian perspective,  this beautifully illustrated book also covers other Jewish holy days and  material that are not normally included in similar studies, and because of  the authors' backgrounds, you can be sure that you are getting authentic  information.  Do you think it will be a coincidence if the three remaining  fall feasts are fulfilled during Christ's second coming?  To find out, read  this book.  To understand why this is not &quot;date-setting&quot;, read  &quot;The Pre-Wrath Rapture Of The Church&quot; by Marvin Rosenthal.	2000-04-17

The book is extremely interesting covering major events in Jewish history as early as circa 9000 BC (!) up through 1991.  Of course most of it deals with the last 2000 years.  What is most shocking is the documentation of  antisemitism that is so widespread in just about every location on the  globe and in every age.<br />The history spanning the last 100 years was  most revealing, showing us bit by bit how the nation of Israel was  re-formed, and how the current conflicts that we still see in the news  today have progressed from their inception.  My understanding of modern  Jewish history increased dramatically by reading through what was going on  in Israel and other parts of the world during the same time frames. The  numerous accounts of events occurring before, during, and after WWII gave  me a new-found perspective on the Jewish plight.  It was quite eye-opening  to find out just who, in the United States and abroad were supporters or  enemies of the Jewish nation.<br />This is a tremendous collection of  newsworthy events important to the Jewish culture arranged so that you can  easily compare history in other parts of the world at the same time.	2000-04-17

Written from a Messianic Jewish perspective, this book is an excellent introduction to both the spring and fall feasts of the Lord.  The reader is guided through the history, prophetic significance, traditional Jewish  observance, and New Testament observance. The author also explains how the  holy days can be celebrated today by all believers in Yeshua Ha Meshiach.   He even includes games, music, and recipes.  The Gentile believers in  Yeshua will be fascinated by the discovery of their Jewish heritage, and  will understand more of what their Bibles are telling them.

The companion book to &quot;God's Appointed Times&quot; by the same author, is just as fascinating as it's predecesor.  After reading it, a Gentile believer in Yeshua Ha Meshiach may wonder how he understood  anything in the Bible at all before this.  Understanding the Jewish  background to the Old and New Testaments can make a world of  difference.   The reader will be delighted to have a resource that not only informs, but  inspires - to the utmost.  The author relates the customs to specific  events in the scriptures so that we become aware of what was happening, but  the main focus is the spritual significance which will really make your  spirit soar.  All the Hebrew prayers are transliterated and translated,  which further helps to connect us with our Jewish roots, and immerse us  into the culture.  This is a great book!	2000-04-16

The author begins by giving you an overview of his version of pretribulationism.  But the best parts of the book are his well-written historical accounts and interesting  commentary on numerous events relating to the endtimes.  I found the vast  background material to be very informative and a big plus.<br />Mr. Hindson  goes to great lengths to remind the reader to always distinguish between  fact, assumption, and speculation, and he repeats this admonition often.   He reacts to other writers' opinions in a professional manner, and offers  practical advice for applying what you have learned.<br />Some noticeable  departures from a more traditional pretribulationism include:<br />1)  He sees  the events of Matthew 24 as encompassing the entire church age.  He states,  &quot;While some commentators limit the events of Matthew 24 to the  tribulation period, it seems clear that they are occurring throughout the  church age as the gospel is preached primarily to the Gentiles.&quot;  This  feature alone can seriously affect one's interpretation of endtime  events.<br />2)  He also views the antichrist not as a person, &quot;but a  political, material, economic, and religious world system in the last days  which is in itself 'antichrist'.&quot;  He does go on to say that,  &quot;there will emerge a powerful individual who will control that system  and use it for evil against God's people.&quot;<br />Although it is not my  main goal to overscrutinize minor inaccuracies, I feel it is necessary to  mention two instances.  First, because they do seem to play a major role in  the author's thinking, and second, because the average reader may not  perceive the discrepancies without them being pointed out.<br />In the  introduction the author instructs the reader to distinguish between the  rapture, which is signless and occurs before the events of the tribulation  period, and the second coming (or &quot;Glorious Appearing&quot;, as it is  known in pretribulationism), which is preceded by &quot;final signs&quot;  most of which take place after the rapture of the church.  I accept this as  the basic premise of pretribulationism.<br />However, when attempting to  demonstrate this relationship, some scriptures are not used  accurately.<br />1)  On page 8, in the introduction, the author states,  &quot;At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with  power and great glory&quot; (LUKE 21:25-27).  He goes on to say,  &quot;These warning signs clearly have to do with Christ's return in  judgment on an unbelieving world.  They will occur toward the END OF THE   GREAT TRIBULATION.&quot;<br />Having just said this, in the very next pararaph  he says, &quot;As we begin to see the potential of these final signs taking  shape, we can safely assume that OUR LORD'S COMING FOR HIS CHURCH is  drawing near.&quot;  He then goes on to quote, &quot;When these things  begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your  redemption is drawing near&quot; (LUKE 21:28).  He then adds, &quot;Keep  looking up!&quot; as a hopeful admonition to the church to look forward to  the rapture.<br />The problem with this is that the verse he quotes admonishes  believers to look up AFTER THE GLORIOUS APPEARING, which has just taken  place in the VERSE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING IT, at the END OF THE GREAT  TRIBULATION.  In fact, the author has just told you that verses 25 through  27 &quot;occur toward the END OF THE GREAT TRIBULATION.&quot;<br />Something  that occurs at the end of the Great Tribulation can not also occur before  the entire 7-year tribulation period starts!  Therefore this verse cannot  be used to admonish believers to look forward to a pretribulation rapture,  which would occur before the tribulation period starts.<br />2)  On page 177,  when the author begins his section on the &quot;blessed hope&quot;.  He  says, &quot;The Bible refers to Christ's return as the 'BLESSED HOPE--THE  GLORIOUS APPEARING of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ' (Titus 2:13).   The sheer joy of knowing that one day we will be RAPTURED into the  presence of Christ causes all earthly concerns to fade into  oblivion.&quot;<br />Again, the problem should now be obvious.  Paul has just  equated the &quot;Blessed Hope&quot; with the &quot;Glorious  Appearing.&quot;  The author then uses this verse to show how the  &quot;Blessed Hope&quot; is referring to a pretribulation rapture.   However, the verse he uses to try to support a pretribulation rapture  actually refers to the Glorious Appearing which occurs at the end of the  Great Tribulation.<br />The book never claimed to be an exhaustive and  completely accurate theological treatise. It is a good book, very  imformative, practical, and enjoyable.  The impression one gets is that the  author genuinely loves the Lord and tries very hard to show love to his  brothers even when they disagree with him, and he encourages others to do  the same.  This is very admirable. His excitement in relating these  prophetic themes to you is obvious, and there is information here that you  will not get in other books.  The book is more than just theology.	2000-04-15

This latest edition also includes the prewrath  position, which unfortunately is misrepresented, although most likely  unintentionally, noting that the author has a reputation for producing  balanced, scholarly works.  His concern for discussing our differences in a  Christ-like manner are evident, and he even remarks, &quot;Great shame and  disgrace has already been brought to the cause of Christ by us over  evangelical eschatologies.&quot;  Written with the layman in mind, the book  will give you a basic overview of endtime theories.

Of particular interest is the inclusion of information about the origin of the pre-trib view from someone within the pre-trib camp itself, and not from an  outsider.  Much of the material focuses on arguments against a post-trib  rapture.  At times though, I was not convinced that some of the arguments  were presented as objectively as they could have been.

The Rapture Question Answered Plain And Simple is a great place to start for your endtimes studies.  This work focuses on the rapture question alone, whereas an earlier work - &quot;The Sign&quot; was a much broader  study in eschatology.  Using a face-value hermeneutic (allowing scripture  to interpret scripture) Van Kampen shows how the chronology of endtime  events is clearly revealed in key prophetic passages.  He shows how the  placement of the rapture within the sequence of endtime events can be  determined, and how all related prophetic accounts are in total agreement.   The material is distilled into easily digestible study units and is a  pleasure to read.  An even easier read is Van Kampen's &quot;The Prewrath  Rapture Position Explained Plain And Simple&quot; which is a 93 page  excerpt from this book.  You should also read &quot;The Sign&quot; by the  same author, and &quot;The Prewrath Rapture Of The Church&quot; by Marvin  Rosenthal.  Together, they will give you a comprehensive understanding of  endtimes theology.	2000-04-11

The author definitely has a problem with name-calling and sarcasm.  Because of this, I found it difficult to purchase the book.  I am a student of Marvin Rosenthal, who, in response to my informing him of the personal  and condescending attacks on him in the book, told me, &quot;Yes, they are  taking me to task.&quot;  This, brothers, is the response of a Christian  gentleman - not even a word to defend himself.  Legitimate theologians have  no need to resort to the base tactics that are employed throughout the  book.<br />The general argumentative tactic used throughout the book is to set  up a straw man, and then to knock it down.  The Bible says that &quot;The  first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and  questions him&quot; (Proverbs 18:17).  Do you really want to seek truth?   Or do you simply want to gather around you a great number of teachers to  tell you what your itching ears desire to hear (2 Timothy 4:3)?  (Yes,  Christians do this too.)  I encourage you to read from as many authors as  you can, (with different points of view of course - not all with the same  view) so that they can present their cases themselves, without any  distortions.  (I also had the opportunity to take a seminar with Hal  Lindsey who presented the pretrib view.) There are things to be learned  from all of them, including Mr. LaHaye.<br />One of the things that struck me  as somewhat odd was that Mr. LaHaye and a number of other theologians set  up the PreTrib Research Center to gather information to prove the pretrib  theory.  Generally speaking, whenever we attempt an interpretation of  scripture, we should never consciously read our own ideas into the text,  nor should we start with a preconceived idea that we wish to prove.  We  should let the text speak for itself, and let the theology flow from the  text to us, and never the other way around.  The whole idea of starting  with a preconceived theory, and then &quot;proving it&quot; with scripture  is contrary to all conscientious interpretation.  How about starting a  &quot;truth&quot; research center, and just letting the Bible speak for  itself?	2000-04-07
