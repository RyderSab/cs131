I had always heard that one could divinate from a regular pack of playing cards but usually it is in the context of a truncated Tarot without the major arcana.  This system is unique in the sense that it is astrologically based not Tarot based and you can spend less than $10 on a decent pack of playing cards, take them anywhere with you, divinate in public without getting the evil eye from born again Christians, and just generally have an alternate way to sharpen your intuition.  I liked the astrological concept in this system and it has already helped me with my regular Tarot readings.  I say, good show!	2005-10-04

Sabine Baring-Gould (1834-1924) was a Vicar in the Church of England in Devon, an archaeologist, folklorist, historian and a prolific author. Baring-Gould was also a bit eccentric. He reputedly taught classes with a pet bat on his shoulder. He is best known for writing the hymn 'Onward Christian Soldiers'.  <br /> <br />This book is one of the most cited references about werewolves. The Book of the werewolf takes a rationalistic approach to the subject.  <br /> <br />The book starts off with a straightforward academic review of the literature of shape-shifting; however, starting with Chapter XI, the narrative takes a strange turn into sensationalistic 'true crime' case-studies of cannibals, grave desecrators, and blood fetishists, which have a tenuous connection with lycanthropy. This includes an extended treatment of the case of Giles de Rais, the notorious associate of Joan of Arc, who was convicted and executed for necrosadistic crimes. Margaret Murray had a controversial theory about this subject <br /> <br />All that aside, if you are the least bit interested in Lycanthropy, you have to read this book! <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

This novel is Corelli's premiere in the world of fiction.  It features dream-magic, mesmerism, with many and varied opium-induced occult powers complete with a world-weary & emotionally crumbling heroine on a quest for the meaning of life - resulting in a cosmic journey by means of astral projection with an angelic guide, embodying a trip to utopian Saturn, to technologically bizarre Jupiter and to the center of the universe, the place of creation, where God dwells in electrical form.  Corelli combines weird science and spiritualism. It is a wild and strange trip to dip into Corelli's world but worth the ride.  A delectably fantastic combination of feminine occult powers combined with sci-fi surrealism.	2005-10-03

Paracelus is my personal favorite of the \\"famous alchemists.\\"  He took an approach that diverged greatly from his contemporaries:  \\"harmony of the man is the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm.\\"  He veered from soul purification and concentrated on how bodies got out of natural balance and how he could cure them.  He summarized his own views by saying: \\"Many have said of Alchemy, that is for making of gold and silver.  For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.\\"  And I am sure that many of the pharmaceutical giants today wholeheartedly agree with him!

Waite writes from the standpoint of an Esoteric Christian and does a good job of reporting the known historical facts of the Kabbalah when it came into written tradition after centuries of oral tradition.  From the standpoint of combining Kabbalah with mystical Christianity, a lot of connections are revealed that enable the student to value this mystical text in perhaps a way he was unable to do so in the past.  Well worth reading!	2005-10-03

I especially enjoyed the chapters on Spiritism, not having before known much about it, and found it to be a lovely path in which I found myself in much agreement.  This is a book of messages.  Messages of hope, of love, of faith, of redemption, of life everlasting.  I absolutely loved it!	2005-10-03

Waite, scholar extraordinaire, mystic, and Freemason, brings a wealth of knowledge and information on Freemasonry to the written page.

A masterpiece for Freemasonry!	2005-10-03

There are tons of books out there on how to read Tarot, but get serious - they are all knockoffs from the master himself.  Waite more than anyone, as co-author of the most frequently used deck in the last century, can take you into the mysteries surrounding the Tarot to help you better divinate the symbolism - especially if you are just developing your intuitive skills.  If you are at all serious about Tarot, you must own this book!	2005-10-03

This was originally published as part of an anthology of short stories and was so well liked that an attractive illustrated gift book of only 5,000 were printed.  Thank you Kessinger Publishing for bringing back what one reviewer in Marie's day called a \\"feverishly eccentric\\" book.  This story rates as the best of Marie Corelli's heretically religious fantasy stories and still does not to this day, fail to impress, charm, or seduce the reader.  What a find!  What a treat!  If you want just a big toe in the waters of Marie Corelli's works, this is the book to buy.	2005-10-03

Known as the Jaqueline Suzann of her time, Corelli, a feminine and non-confrontational 'lipstick lesbian' was as deplored by critics of serious literature as was Ms. Suzann.

This is a sweet and tender love story that  I enjoyed thoroughly and can only imagine the quivering Victorian women who devoured its pages.	2005-10-03

The Zohar is widely considered the most important work of Kabbalah and Waite aids the reader in unraveling many of its most important themes such as the nature of God, the origin and structure of the Universe, the nature of souls, sin, redemption, good and evil.  It typifies the highest degree of divine love as esthetic contemplation.  It is still a treasured part of the Hasidim and held in great reverence by many Orthodox Jews as well.  If you know nothing about the Zohar, then this is an excellent place to start your education!	2005-10-03
