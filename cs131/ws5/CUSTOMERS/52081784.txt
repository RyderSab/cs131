I've read pretty much everything he's published, some of it several times. His Sandman series still stands as the best arguement for the legitimacy of comics-as-literature I've ever heard. Its interesting that he describes his popularity as being sexually-transmitted (boyfriends turning girlfriends onto his stuff). I don't know how many ex-girlfriends read Sandman because I gave it them, but it was a lot. <br /> <br />I didn't care much for Good Omens and American Gods seemed like a one-trick pony to me. Both had ok storylines, but compared to Sandman, Signal to Noise, Books of Magic and Mr. Punch, they were good fiction, just not good Gaiman fiction. <br /> <br />Now along comes Anansi Boys and I have to tell you, this is better.  Its very funny in parts but the story is involving. The people in the book are people for whom you come to care. There are no cardboard cutouts, there are no throwoff characters. Instead, there's a fun story that you'll (that I) whip (ped) through and finished with regret. <br /> <br />When Neil Gaiman is ON, there's nobody who is more ON. When he's off, he's still better than most. Here, he tells a story about a trickster god and his wayward children that make me wish I worshipped the deity.	2005-10-07

In case you didnt' know, its the sequel to Starfish and number 2 of 4 in the Rifters series. The third and fourth parts are two halves of one book that have been published separately because together it was more than 110,000 words, an obscure number in publishing that means the book can't make enough to be worth publishing alone. <br /> <br />Starfish was one of the more imaginative sciece fiction novels that I've ever read. If you remember the hype that surrounded William Gibson when he wrote Mona Lisa Overdrive, you might also remember how disappointing those books were. More about style than substance.  Peter Watts delivers both style and substance in an elegant and beautiful writing style. His books are HARD sci fi. You'll have to pay attention but its very much worth the trip. Watts delivers what Gibson was supposed to...in spades. <br /> <br />Starfish was about adapted humans living in the deep sea vents, mining geologic heat to convert into energy for the world above the waters. They have been modified to be able to live underwater (I want to be one!) and they're psychotic.  <br /> <br />Maelstrom picks right up where Starfish ended and turned up the dial about a thousand percent. Wow.  What an amazing read! <br /> <br />If you like science fiction, you'll love these books. They are the gold nuggets that we will read a thousand books to try to find. Save yourself the nine hundred ninety nine books and go get this one.  <br /> <br />Five stars, which I'm not sure I've ever given before.	2005-09-19
US	52081784	R166ID3C7TT0ON	0375412913	487342812	Lunar Park	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Bret Easton Ellis Does a Remarkable Imitation of Himself	I've been a Bret Easton Ellis fan since his first novel, Less Than Zero. I'm not alone in this respect. I believe every other review here also says the same thing.  But I'm in agreement with Norman Mailer in his opinion that \\"Ellis...has forced us to look at intolerable material and so few novelists try for that anymore.\\"  <br /> <br />Clearly, his is a unique voice, one of absolute, irresolute authority on his subjects. Often, his subjects aren't clear, but he does speak with that authority. His characters are frequently under the influence of drugs and sex, tainted and poisoned by the same. <br /> <br />In Lunar Park, Ellis' main character is more than himself. Having read, after the book, his recent biography, it seems that he chose to follow a literary path that was a departure from his real one. Its a literary might-have-been haunted by grief, guilt and irredeemable flaws. <br /> <br />Recently, I described the process of writing (I write as well) as a search for a string of words that sing, harmonically. Every once in a while a sentence is born that seems in tune to the universe. Occassionally, a paragraph can carry the tune. Reading for the sake of literature is looking for an entire book that can pull of that tricky little trick. I've read maybe 20 in my life. I'm 41 and I've read thousands of books, several a week since I learn how to read. <br /> <br />Of that 20, two were probably written by Bret Easton Ellis. <br /> <br />Lunar Park is no exception. It is literate, knowing and his dialogue pops. The story is a good one (the haunted house story with the author as both house and haunter) and it proceeds quickly.  I had some problems with the length and breadth of Glamorama but this new one has no pacing troubles. When you're done, you're sorry the trip is over. <br /> <br />I recommend this book heartily to who ever is reading this. I'd caution that a study of Ellis' other books (particularly American Psycho but also Less than Zero, Informers, Rules of Attraction and Glamorama) before hand will enrich the experience. <br /> <br />Hope you like it.  I have a question though for those who read the book.  If you haven't, stop reading this review immediately. <br /> <br /> <br />Still there?  What in hell happened to the boys?	2005-09-12

That they became two books is either a function of novel length (some publishers don't want novels over a certain word count as demand drops for heavier tomes and cost go up) or a test for the first before dropping out the second. <br /> <br />Both books aren't horrendous. The author does have a tale to tell, but the uneven tone of the story (consistently uneven...even in its unevenness) and the cardboard cutouts for most of the characters really impacts his telling of the tale. <br /> <br />I like zombie movies.  Zombie books have been much more miss than hit because, after all, it is a visual horror. To say 'The zombie sat up and said \\"Boo!\\"' is not as scary as seeing it. But I'm a fairly devoted follower of Romero. I log in daily to [...] and have even contributed 4 stories to their fiction section. (if you're interested, they are The Colonel and the Farmboy, My World Ended on a Wednesday, When the Lights Go Down In The City and The Dead Ones Walk and I Sleep.) <br /> <br />This is going to be a long review, but between the two books, I've been reading for two weeks and it ought to be a little long <br /> <br />Although Keane's books follow different rules than Romero's universe (the zombies can move quickly, some talk and the animals are also zombified)that isn't a detriment. What seems lacking is imagination. Every aspect of this universe is derived from other sources. The demons that imhabit the dead are straight out of Lovecraft, the cannibalistic habits are Romero, the attack on the City of the Dead (the building) are Land of the Dead. The apocalypse itself is served up as a combination of the video game Half-Life (and Doom III) and The Stand. The ghost helping them is also reminiscent of The Stand, substituting a black preacher for a black woman (Mother Abigail if I remember my Stand right) <br /> <br />Wierdly, there is a certain thread of faith running throughout the book. Despite everything, there is insistance that G-d is up there and all this is being done to spite him.  There's never any proof, other than a cat called God, a wierd little allegory that is overused in the second book and a preacher named Martin. <br /> <br />Another thing that Keane overdoes is the horrors he details. I get the nastiness of it all, the goriness but he described the same worm dropping out of a dozen noses/wounds/etc. From there, he goes on to necrophilia, child abuse, forced prostitution and, of all things, the Courtship of Eddie's Father. <br /> <br />The ending of the first book (I won't ruin it) does nothing but sell the second book. If you haven't read the first book, buy them together or you're likely going to be pretty angry. It ends on a cliffhanger but cliffhangers are generally about scenes. This book's cliffhanger leaves the actual resolution of the first book unresolved.  <br /> <br />Ok, enough. It wasn't torture but it wasn't as good as it could be.  I'll check in again with Mr. Keane, but its going to be a couple of books further down the pike.  Somewhere in him is the ability to tell an interesting story but it isn't there yet.	2005-08-24

He reminds me of nothing so much as Mario Puzo (in Fool's Die style) and John Knowles (superficially akin to Separate Peace. <br /> <br />The story line is riveting, the characters are people that you would have liked to have known.  Honestly, between this and Brightness Falls, I believed McInherney was turning into one of the best novelist in the last ten years.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, his work seems to have slowed considerably and I've order The Good Life, but wish I could count on more writing of this caliber.	2005-07-19

It has believable drama, taut events and ideas popping off every page. It is as strong a story as I've read in years and honestly it is an example of science fiction surpassing its boundaries. Like some of the best I've read (Brin, Bear, Long) this is the type of fiction that I will read five hundred books looking for. I've already ordered the sequels and look forward to their arrival. <br /> <br />Nice work, Mr. Watts...keep writing and I'll keep reading! <br /> <br />	2005-06-14
US	52081784	R1L2OG2LUTSCOO	0441008763	496933037	The Coming	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	Intriguing but not what I generally expect from Mr. Haldeman	Over the years, I've read a lot of Mr. Haldeman's novels. I've enjoyed nearly all of them, truely thought a few were great literature (Forever War, Mindbridge). When I picked up The Coming, I'd just finished reading Camoflage and thought it was terrific.<br /><br />This was a deeply different tone but not an inauthentic one. Haldeman does write politics sometimes, usually (apparently) as an extension of his wartime experiences.<br /><br />In my opinion, The Coming was a terrific story that got bogged down by its backstory.  It had a great setup in the first twenty pages or so and then it was all character for the next couple hundred. Then the alien story took center stage and the setup went unfulfilled. Even the surprise at the end wasn't that much of a surprise. It telegraphed itself fairly early on in the story and, once exposed, the surprise could have used the same depth of backstory granted each of the main characters.<br /><br />It felt like Mr. Haldeman spent time building his people up and then failed to structure an ending that satisfied. Now I've got all these characters in my head and I don't know where any of them wound up...<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in The Coming but the writing is superb. If there was a sequel tomorrow, I wouldn't wait for paperback but I would hope from more than I got from the first one.	2005-06-06

Books	2	0	1	N	Y	Cute idea...not that great in execution	The author, Mr. Boyett, definitely has his literary background down pat. He's managed to capture the look but not the soul of each of the writers that he portrays. But the book is banal, the stories aren't very good. They're like one trick ponies, one joke stories that go on for too long. <br /> <br />The Star Trek elements will have the inner geek in you smiling but that's about the limit. <br /> <br />BTW, the only story in the book that I kind of liked was the Anne Rice Parody, the Vampire LeForge.  That was pretty funny.	2005-05-02
US	52081784	R3SY81POT8QH7Y	0843953640	440589384	Fiend	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	Another great vamp book by Jemiah	I went through a phase a few years ago when I found myself digging vampire fiction. Its not like I'm a goth wannabe. In fact, I'm 40 and wear a suit everyday. Its just that sometimes, I suddenly notice I've been reading a lot of the same stuff. Its just what for whatever reason, I'm digging on at that point. <br /> <br />I got lucky.  I found Voice of the Blood, Jemiah's first novel. It stood out from the pack like nobody's business. In it, we are introduced to vampires Ariane, Orfeo and Daniel. Its really Ariane's story but its a great introduction to the universe contained in her fiction. <br /> <br />The sequel, Wounds, explored Daniel's world. It extended brilliantly and Daniel (was he named for Daniel Ash? Can't tell why but the character reminds me of the Bauhaus/Love and Bullets fronter)was compelling. In Wounds, he takes front stage and the book is amazing. I've read it a dozen times. The only thing I wasn' clear on was the ending...what happened to my compelling character??? Darned if I know. <br /> <br />Now in Fiend, we get Orfeo's history. Where there were flashbacks in the first two books, this one is all a flashback. Whatever story there remains for Jemiah to relate about her vampires (I hope there's a lot more) Fiend does nothing to extend the story. We don't get to find out what happens next in their history, instead, fiend paints a remarkable picture of the background to the first two novels. It paints it brilliantly in lovely, sensual colors and the scenes it depicts make you want to go there and see for yourself. <br /> <br />I find myself comparing Jemiah to Anne Rice. It is not just the subject of vampires. It is not just the populating of those vampires with a sensuous love life. Jemiah's vampire remind me of Lestat and their ilk in her regard for rich back histories and deep inner lives. There is also a shared theme of gay love in both series which is not an interest of mine but Jemiah's sex scenes are awfully well written. <br /> <br />I've read all of Rice. I've read all of Jemiah's books. I'll trade any four of Rice's (especially the New Vampire series) books for any one of Jemiah's any day of the week. <br /> <br />Keep up the great work, Jemiah if you're reading this.  You've a fan in me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />_	2005-04-15

If you've never read any of Richard Preston's other books about biology (The Hot Zone and Demon in the Freezer), you're in for a treat.  The three books (Cobra which is fiction, Zone and Demon which aren't) comprise his black-biology trilogy and taken in total or in part, they're scary, fact filled and speak volumes about their topics. Don't think they sound boring. I bet you won't be able to put them down once  <br />you start reading. <br /> <br />The Hot Zone, which was a NYT bestseller for practically ever, is about the emergence of Ebola in Africa. This is the story of the strains of Marburg that killed 210 people this week in Angola.  <br /> <br />The other, Demon in the Freezer is a two step story about the amazing eradication of smallpox from Earth and the anthrax terror deliveries post-9/11. If you want to know the stories behind the story, this is a good place to go. <br /> <br />What stands out clearly in the Cobra Event is Preston's absolute authority on the topic of biological warfare.  If his facts are true, and no one since had disputed a single one of them (including President Clinton who apparently, after reading Cobra Event, ordered a feasibility study), the Iraq clearly had WMD, biological agents, etc. Preston leaves no room for doubt. What's scary is who else had access. Simply everyone and there's lots of dangerous stuff missing out there. <br /> <br />Now to the story.  For the first time, Preston has written a novel. The story certainly engages, although it is the facts that really scare you.  I recommend it to any reader who likes facts behind their story.  <br /> <br />The story is of a terrorist planning a live laydown of a viral brain pox strain in NYC and thereby killing millions. The book is about what happens. <br /> <br />Anyhow, the book will scare you but it isn't the kind of scare that goes away after you finish it. This is the kind of scare that makes you write your congressman and ask what in hell they're doing to prevent the problem. <br /> <br />If anyone decides to read...share your opinion!	2005-04-13
US	52081784	R2GCUAJGI4IT2L	0441011616	812276406	Camouflage	Books	4	7	8	N	N	I'm a fan of Haldeman's	Camouflage was pretty darned good. <br /> <br />Mr. Haldeman's writing seems to go in two directions normally. On the one hand, he writes books like Forever XXX (War, Peace, Free), All My Sins Remembered, Mindbridge (a personal favorite) or Tool of the Trade. These are gripping remarkable stories that I hate to see end.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are the Worlds novels, the Vietnam era things (I know Mr. Haldeman is a veteran but did not enjoy these as much) Buying Time and a number of others. They aren't bad, but if I hadn't tricked onto Mindbridge early in my game, I wouldn't have found the rest. <br /> <br />When Mr. Haldeman is good, there's no one better. I really dig his stuff and Camouflage is one of those. <br /> <br />With this new novel, it seems Mr. Haldeman saw the movie Species and came up with some interesting variants of his own. His aliens are pretty cool and the story rocks.  If I have any complaint, it is the standard Haldeman complaint that it ended very abruptly.  I hope that there will be a sequel and that Mr. Haldeman is almost done writing it. <br /> <br />	2005-03-29

Bruce Springsteen is a good example. Play any of his music before and then after The River and you'd have a hard time proving their the same artist.  <br /> <br />Having said that, John Varley remains one of my favorite authors and I have high hope he's going to knock my socks off again. The John Varley Reader did that but I'd read most of it before. I want a new Gaea, Louise Baltimore, Cirocco Jones! I want Titanides, symbs and the Eight Worlds! I just haven't gotten it in awhile. <br /> <br />But when I was...John Varley remains one of my favorite authors.  <br /> <br />I first read his Gaea trilogy and was bowled over by how fantastic the story was. His Living World (Gaea) and Cirrocco Jones are two characters that I've revisited many times over the years. I've reread the trilogy no less than a half dozen times. <br /> <br />After reading his short story collections (Persistence of Vision and Blue Champagne) I decided that the Eight Worlds was pretty amazing and his short stories as fun and tight as they come. After 5 years of searching every bookstore, I found The Ophiuchi Hotline and it became my favorite book of all time. Man, but that boy could write! <br /> <br />Millenium kicked but was tonally different. Great book, can't stop reading it when I start, but I guess that was the morph from the Varley then and the Varley now. I know in the autobiographical parts of the Reader, it seems like things did change for him at that point. Superheroes, a collection of short stories by other people about (what else) superheroes was fun, but it was not a true Varley novel. <br /> <br />Recent years have brought some disappointments for me. Steel Beach and the Golden Globe I could not work my way through. Red Thunder is a lot of fun and very reminiscent of Heinlein's work for younger readers. There is enough meat there to entice adult readers and reminded me of why I liked Varley in the first place. From his notes in the Reader, it seems Mr. Varley is writing a sequel to Red Thunder. I await it eagerly. <br /> <br />Eagerly but sadly. I've spent years waiting to be bowled back over and its ironic that it took this collection of short stories to do it. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that they're just as wild, inventive and dynamic as they were when I read them in my teens and the couple of times since. They're amazing and this collection reminds me of nothing quite so much as the possibilities of scifi and where it can take you. <br /> <br />John, if you're reading this...bravo! And if you are, please make a return to form! Knock my socks off like Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo. Or the Barbie Murders or the Trilogy. I'm quite happy waiting for whatever you write next, but would love to see you back doing what you do best: inventing a future where we'd all choose to live. Thanks again for all the great words! <br /> <br />	2004-11-08

Look at the story	Out of the seven books, there are at least 3 really good ones. I wish I could tell you which of the seven make up the 3 but they are strewn throughout the material and incorporate elements from all seven.  <br /> <br />I've spent an awful lot of time reading this series and as a 'constant reader' of King's work, I feel qualified to review it. <br /> <br />The series itself is good but the comments about King's verbal diarrhea are accurate. I don't know if Mr. King is at a point in his career when editors no longer need to review and prune his work but sometimes he seems to take 10 words when 2 will do.  More to the point, his 800+page/volume monsters could have been well condensed and the story could still have been well-told, made better for the brevity and clarity.  <br /> <br />The final book, The Dark Tower, was satisfying enough. I found the ending a little trite, a little sudden for all that came before it but I suppose (particularly after talking about too the words-to-story ratio) an extended version would only have detracted. More, I found my satisfaction in the story not in its ending but in the Coda, the denoument, the story AFTER the story. There I found the ending that I liked. <br /> <br />From the kvetching comments I've read, I think people after 30 years are simply used to waiting for the next volume.

This time, it is almost all characterization and the storyline is almost secondary. <br /> <br />Mr. Long is a talented writer and I will continue to buy and read what he writes.  However, this was not one of my favorites of his work.	2004-09-17

I read the Dead by Rogers and I have to say that it was really bad. <br /> <br />The story isn't horrible.  The action scenes at least work, very reminiscent of either Romero's work or that old Dead World comic. <br /> <br />But interspersed are long dialogues about the nature of man and God and the Devil. NOT kidding.  This book is fundementalist and the dead coming back to life are there to punish sinners. <br /> <br />Thought I'd read it all (I did read this whole book) before but this one was a first.  <br /> <br />If the author reads this...please in future editions, make the religious sections in a red font so readers know what to skip.	2004-09-17

In fact the entire book managed to transcend its peers, among whom I might look to Patricia Cornwell, Highsmith's Ripley books and Thomas Harris gone feminine. <br /> <br />I did not have difficulty with the saltiness of the language, but I could understand if others did.  But to read it looking for that will disappoint.  Read this if you want to be taken on a journey by a fascinating character.	2004-09-17

Its Romero-esque zombie apocalypse running 28-Days-Later stylewith Ginger Snaps female hormones wrapped up with Max Max and (of all things) Below.  <br /> <br />After all the women of the world go Xombie, also turning the men, a girl who is immune manages to escape aboard an Ohio-class submarine looking for safe haven. <br /> <br />If the writing wasn't so good (its very good) I'd call the novel too derivative to stand on its own but it zips along and you keep turning the pages and surprise...when its done, you're sorry. <br /> <br />Its a worthy read and the end was a pleasant surprise.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-11
US	52081784	R1ECK2Q0IH7O5R	0802141293	66882361	Troll: A Love Story	Books	4	15	20	N	Y	What an odd and interesting novel	Troll is both more and less than you might think, reading the 'reviews' here on Amazon.<br />The novel is about a photographer adopting a wild troll.  In his world, trolls were discovered to be real in 1907 although encounters with them are so extremely rare that there is very little real cataloguing of habits, eating, mating, etc. Much of the book has excepts from poetry, stories, fables and well-faked scientific treatises.<br />The story happens in between these excepts.<br />The story itself is fascinating.  Angel is a believable protagonist and, his gayness aside, completely sympathetic.  He could be me, were I gay. If I met the troll Pessi, I'd have adopted him too.<br />It is quite short.  I finished it in 3 days of commuting to work and I'm having some trouble getting it out of my mind.  If you are looking for an odd love story, this is a good one.  If you are looking for straightforward narrative or action, it may not. Sinisalo reminds me of Joyce Carol Oates in her depiction of horror in everyday life and the likability of her characters. If you are an Oates fan, you will like this very much.	2004-05-20

Mr. Shirley does know how to tell a story and he manages to maintain suspense through out, but I found his characters to be somewhat cookie cutter (and too many of them, I couldn't keep easy track) although he certainly has a good ear for dialogue.<br />Crawlers has an interesting enough plot, but it is executed over too many pages. It starts with a boom and we barely hear an echo for a hundred pages after. Four hundred pages later, I found myself wondering when it was going to end.<br />I will read Mr. Shirley's other works but for the moment, I find myself not trusting his work completely.	2004-02-09
US	52081784	R296ENS8OF2HL9	1592910122	97354692	Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1	Books	4	16	24	N	Y	This is going to be a schizophrenic review	I have to split how I am going to review Alan Moore's Writing for Comics.<br />First, we'll focus on the content.  Then we'll focus on style. This is nothing new.  For comics, there are some I've bought for art, some for the content and a few (very few) for the mixture.  I loved Gaiman's Sandman for it thoughts but the art was merely passable.  Likewise for Invisibles and even Morrison admits that by the last volume, the art and editting had rendered his work nearly unreadably incoherant. On the other hand, there are the art books like anything by Alex Ross, Linzer and Monk's Angel series and almost anything by Perez or Zulli.  There are more, I've left out lots but my list isn't why I'm posting this review.<br />As usual, Alan Moore has a lot on his mind and is electric in the way he tells it.  In this case, its a post-Stephen-King-On-Writing done Moore-style with lots of cross references to his own work.  That is both legitimate (Moore is a true innovator) and appreciated (I've like his stuff forever).  There's a lot to tell and Alan does it well and succinctly.<br />As to the style, this book is awful.  The type is set as block-justified which means that some paragraphs are s t r e t c h e d which is difficult to read.  The pictures seem to have little relation to the material and the book itself was poorly constructed. <br />I have a primary complaint in that sometimes the publishers don't take their comic material seriously.  I found a series of Moore's Swamp Thing series that was published in England that was, inexplicably, completed in black and white.  Similarly, I found Neil Gaiman's Alice Cooper graphic novel (which is one of those rare style AND content providers) but it was published in BROWN...completely in brown. The picture, the words, everything. Hmm, are misprintings in comics worth anything?  I know in coins they are...<br />Combine the two and you have here a 4, which tells you how much I like Moore's ideas on how to write for comics.  What's more, the same advice applies, I believe, to any writing is invaluable. <br />So, if you're thinking of buying because you have an interest in writing...do so, but focus on the material and not how it is presented which is just fair.	2004-02-09

What I got was a very funny (laugh-out-loud funny) satirical novel that is about towing the 2 mile long body of God to Antartica for preservation.<br />I didn't expect it but the book was terrific.

Startide Rising was the first of his books that I read and I worked my way through the entire Uplift Series and enjoyed the heck out of them.  Great Stuff.<br />Other novels of his that I thought were terrific included Earth and (my favorite) Heart of the Comet with Benford.  <br />This graphic novel is the second gn of his that I've read.  The first was a Star Trek story that, while good, was derivative.<br />The origins of this story come from one of David's short stories and it kind of shows.  The story is very good and the artwork is well done.  The story, while a little disjointed, is a fascinating easy read with ideas that make you think.  What were the Nazis up to really?  All the religious mumbo jumbo...was there a plan?<br />David, if you're reading this, please consider applying the graphic novel treatment to your Uplift Series. Uplift is terrific and vital and while I would imagine you have other ideas in mind for your next books, they cry out for adaptation.	2003-11-11

The books teem with psycho killers doing unspeakably nasty things to innocents and with the angelic qualities of their heroes.<br />But along the way, there is lots of well-researched history, alternating perspective and character building.  For the most part, they are informative and interesting thrillers.<br />My only complaint is that the heroes are nowhere near as interesting as the villians (in Bed of Nails, I was rooting for the villian who, in interest of remaining spoiler free I will not reveal, to get the good guy once and for all). The heroes seem almost cardboard thin and just as stiff and the plot moves them around rather than the other way.<br />Jay, Rebecca, I enjoy your books and this one was very snappy.  I like the con-geek segments as I've lived those as well. The mention of SCA brought a particular smile to my face as I've been a member for many years.  Keep up the good work!	2003-09-03

This was a great book but this is an AWFUL abridgement.  Literally, the tapes (672 pages boiled down to two audio cassettes) should be call THEGTW as that is how boiled down it is. Whole characters are gone.  Whole story lines are discarded.  Stephen King once said that he won't ever allow abridgements and now I understand why.

When Apocalypse End came out, I tried reading it and it didn't keep my interest.<br />It is good zombie horror, but only because most of the genre isn't very good.  Skipp and Spector put out 2 volumes (Books of the Dead 1 and 2:Still Dead) and those had some pretty good stories.  The third volume was apparently cancelled due to licensing concerns (I had an email conversation with Poppy Z. Brite two years ago who said she wrote a story for it and it promptly disappeared) but most of the literature that is zombie horror is dreck.  <br />This is not dreck, its a pretty good storyline that tags in perfectly with Romero's zombie future.  However, the medium itself (literature vs. film) is visual and books don't convey the same sense of horror.  ...In fact, you find yourself suspending disbelief a lot.  P>This book is good zombie horror, but only fair horror in general. I would have given it a 3.5 star rating, but not an option here so ROTD:AE gets a 4.	2003-08-11

I've liked pretty much everything I've read of his, and I've made a concerted effort to read it all.  From the early short stories to the broad and sweeping Uplift Series/Uplift Storm, I've liked the worlds he's created.  The Uplift everythings, I've read several times.  My favorite was his collaboration with Gregory Benford in Heart of the Comet.<br />I saw this with some eagerness, listed both on Brin's website and then subsequently on Amazon.com. I preordered it some time ago and just got it over the weekend. I socked it away in less than an hour.<br />Not a bad story.  There were similarities I think with ST:First Contact in the angle of inventor/developer of commonplace future technologies. The characters were well used and as an ensemble piece (which Star Trek usually is) its pretty good.<br />If I had a complaint, which I don't really, it only that Mr. Brin seems somewhat hemmed in when building stories in someone else's universe. I've come to expect him to push the envelope, to develop characters that I really like (Mr. Brin, I'd very much like the phone number of Athaclena...I would not have hesitated, Tymbrini or not...<sm>).<br />Its all there for the average author but I was a little let down.<br />A suggestion if I may...Mr. Brin, now that you've ventured into the world of graphic media, please adapt your other works, the ones that you've done such a wonderful job building and populating.  I would love to see Heart or any/all of the Uplift series adapted as graphic novels.	2003-07-28

The Gaea trilogy is amazing in its own right, but it is, essentially, fantasy.  The O Hotline is science fiction and it is done very very well.<br />Varley's most recent works (Golden Globe, Steel Beach) have been disappointments to me, particularly compared to this, the trilogy and his short fiction anathologies.  I originally spent years looking for a copy of the O Hotline, finding it in a used bookstore.  It captivated me.  I didn't want it to end and when it did, I thought it clipped off a little too quickly.  <br />Having said that, its easily a five star and it is the science fiction novel that all others will be judged against.  Simply, is it as good as the O Hotline? If not, then it is a four star.	2003-04-03

I couldn't care less about Mr. Gray and the struggle for control just didn't work for me.<br />By the time I finished, I'd been ready to be finished for 200 pages.  Sigh...<br />Stephen, if you're reading this: Scare me again, would you?  I could always count on you for that....	2001-09-05

When I read the Hunger (very recently) I came to the conclusion that Anne Rice ripped Streiber off completely, that everything I liked about Lestat actually came from Whitely.  I gave the Hunger to my wife and she agreed.<br />Now, with the Last Vampire...did Streiber rip off John Steakly and John Carpenter from Vampire$???? I mean there were scenes that (as I remember) were taken whole out of Vampire$ the book!<br />LV is kind of a split personality book.  I liked it, though not as much as Hunger and Miriam Blaylock is too cool for words.  If this has been optioned for a movie, it will be interesting to see who makes it....	2001-09-05

This is a good thing.  The problem is that sometimes he loses his characters to the science and the story gets a bit muddled.<br />This one is terrific.  They are short stories, so, simply, there isn't time to lose the story.<br />For a great Benford book, check out Timescape or Benford and Brin's Heart of the Comet.	2001-06-20

Between stories, he seems to morph into a completely different person who happens to have the same name.  The stories aren't great, although it very obvious that they were written in the 60s and defined a trippy lifestyle.<br />Nah, pass.  I read 3 of the 4 stories in this book already and was ready to give up by the end of the first.  I was just too stubborn to stop...	2001-06-20

Everytime I read amazon reviews that glow, I buy the book, read it and then remember that only people who care about the book bother to write the reviews.<br />Boy, was I wrong.  Damn good book.  Several people mentioned Anne Rice in their reviews and I wish Rice got back to writing this coherently again, telling stories about vampires that you like. (Did anyone actually LIKE Vittorio, Pandora, etc.  Maybe the ideas turned you on, but jesus, Lestat was the only vampire I actually wanted to BE).  Jemiah delivers the goods and I only can express my thanks to her for it.<br />By the way, Jemiah, if you're reading this....get a better cover.  Whoever did your marketing and design did you an injustice.<br />Geo	2001-05-04

This book is dynamite and a great read.  It was a fair movie (with some laughable sfx) but the book delivers.<br />John, if you're out there...go back to Gaea.  Get back on the airplane.  Go to Jupiter and kick those mysterious thingies butts!  Quit messing with reporters and faux-shakesperean actors.	2001-03-08

I couldn't follow the storyline and the narration kept wandering into wierd territory.  The above 'death and his army of the undead' is the kind of drivel that fills the entire book. Not good, although there were some good ideas.	2001-02-20

But this is a reprint from an earlier publication and it is in Black and White (or more peculiarly, brown and white).<br />If you can get the original printing, the colors were lovely.  They are less so with this edition.<br />Negatives asides, this is an excellent story.  The tie-in with Alice Cooper only made me want to buy AC music (which I did and remembered that I'm not a fan of AC at all) and go find that theater.  Very cool stuff	2001-02-15

They are brilliant and redefined my world.<br />But I tell you true that Promethea reads like someone who can't write trying hard to sound like Neil Gaiman while revamping an old superhero.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Maybe once Alan has time to season the heroine.	2000-09-25

I'm not gay, never interested  in gay fiction whose only distinction lies gay themes, but her writing  superlatively defines a voice in horror that is distinct and unique.  I  like her stuff.  <br />But Plastic Jesus (Amazon couldn't obtain it for me, a  website had a signed copy sent to me within a week) was just not good.  For  the first time, her writing strayed into that '...only distinction' zone  and I was left asking, &quot;so what?&quot; <br />Now, I'm a Beatles fan, but  if John and Paul were lovers, I'll leave you with the same question : So  what?	2000-09-19

That book blew my mind.<br />This one continued the process of my own mental big bang.  Benford, a brilliant physicist,  continues to excel at created new and realistic views of science.  In  Eater, he brings a brilliant view of allies and enemies, progressions in  alien viewpoints and human perspectives.<br />Keep up the great work,  Gregory...oh, and while I'm at it....can I request a sequel to Heart of the  Comet?	2000-05-26

It is not.<br />What it is is an excellent novel of expansive future fiction.<br />What it is not is a true sequel in  tone, voice or narrative to Forever War.  To complain that it is not a true  sequel is correct.  To complain that it is not a good book is wrong.  To  compare it to Forever War is to invite confusion.<br />Very few books can  compare to Forever War.  But to read this book is to invite pleasure and to  think about its concepts is to enjoy the things that I like best in science  fiction.	2000-01-28

But the information is seriously dated (it takes about limited partnerships), the stories are overly simple and  not poignant, and the final effect is a compelling scenario that makes you  wish you were in business in the early 80s when this book was recent and  relevent.<br />Don't waste your time or your money.	1999-06-02
