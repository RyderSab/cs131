AJ Jacobs may not have realized his book could be seen as redemptive, or life-affirming, but to me The Know-It-All is both. I purchased this book one week after losing my dearest friend, at far too young an age, to colon cancer. At the time I was grasping at straws in a mad attempt to find something that could distract me from my grief.  Nothing else was working, frankly, and I was mired in unhappiness.  I'd read a review of Jacobs' book a few weeks before, and the premise sounded intriguing. When I saw it hit the bookstore shelves I decided I'd give it a try. Imagine my surprise when I found myself riveted, and able to lose myself (and thus for a time forget my sorrow) completely. Then I found myself laughing at the self-deprecating humor, and before I knew it I began to feel a certain sense of inspiration and consolation in the whole sweep of human history, despite the occasional human foibles pointed out so perceptively by Jacobs.  I'll never forget that this book, and this author, helped me through one of the darkest times in my life.  This book may not be such a savior to everyone, but I can't see how anyone could read it and not be charmed and instructed.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2004-11-22

Susan Hill paces the plot superbly, unfolding the evil in measured doses as she pulls the reader into the story. The characters are so well-crafted. Hooper is one of the most thoroughly vile characters I've encountered in a long time, and the influence completely good character in the book, is the perfect contrast in the story, and he  unwittingly enables Hooper to sink to even greater depths of vileness.. Just a superb book, crafted by a master.	2004-10-24

Little Amy Dorrit, child of the Marshelsea, is everyone's little martyr.  She's a symbol of all that's pure and good and she's also one of the few truly good, kind characters in this novel.  All Dickens is, frankly, essential reading. Little Dorrit may not be the most riveting of his novels but still it is clearly the work of one of the greatest literary craftsmen who ever drew breath.	2004-10-23

Two young school friends spend a summer together, and one of the two carries love notes between two young lovers.  Ultimately this leads to a tragic suicide.  Fans of psychological literary fiction, and such authors as Iris Murdoch, Ian McEwan, etc., will greatly enjoy this story.	2004-10-23

I loved the dark world of Gormenghast. Peopled with larger than life characters it's among the most vividly written books I've ever read in any genre. Until I read this book I was admittedly skeptical about the fantasy genre as a whole, but after reading this stunning book I realized there was a whole world of writing out there I'd overlooked.

It's also likely her most accessible, and the pacing of it is superb.  THE MILL ON THE FLOSS is a very autobiographical novel, to a heartbreaking extent. I highly recommend reading this one alongside a bio of Eliot as it really highlights the aspects of Maggie Tolliver that come directly from Eliot herself.  A brilliant, brilliant read, and one of my favorite Victorian novels.	2004-10-23

Though the message is important, and Morrie himself obviously an exceptional human being, the writing style was only mediocre.  I was left feeling somewhat hollow when I finished the book, but it did accomplish its goal of impressing the great character of the title character.

This is a very well-written portrait and makes for great reading. It contained a bit more about the politics of the time than is of interest to me, but for those interested in such things I imagine all of that was entirely riveting.  I was most interested in Georgiana the woman and what motivated her, and here Foreman did not disappoint.  An excellent biography and an eye-opening look in to the 18th Century.	2004-10-23

No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period.  If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent.  It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know.  If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now.  You don't read THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD for the plot. You read it for the study.  It remains an important book.	2004-10-23

So much of it is badly written with characters who are wooden, formulaic and uninteresting.  O'Nan's book is a shining exception in sea of mediocrity. Aside from my mild annoyance with one point of his style (his use of the second person in telling the story), the book was flawless and one of the best contemporary books I've ever read.	2004-10-23

Trapped in a cave and weak from disease, Manase finds himself next to a dying officer who's feverishly giving lectures on geology.  When he eventually does go home Manase becomes obsessed by rocks to the extent he has no time for his wife and children, driving a wedge between himself and his family. One day his oldest son starts visiting his father's workshop, intensely interested in learning more about rocks and geology.  Manase, skeptical at first, becomes overjoyed that he's able to pass along his passion to his child. Then one day tragedy strikes, out of the blue, and the lives of Manase and his family begin spiralling down to disaster.<br /><br />This novel is ultimately about how tiny human beings really are, in the big scope of things. It's also about man's inhumanity to man, and how each person is connected to everything else in the universe.  This is a moving little book with very much to say.	2004-10-23

I thought the premise utterly intriguing from the first review I read about the book, and I was in no way disappointed. The character of Pi Patel is engaging and charming, and he's one of the most endearing characters I've &quot;met&quot; in recent fiction.  Having finished this book just yesterday I am still in the process of digesting it. This is a book that will remain with me for a long time and one I plan to re-read at some point in the future. I'm positive it will hold up to my high opinion of it when I do get around to the re-read.  This book has renewed my faith in contemporary literature.	2003-02-05

I'm a fan of the writing of British women, with few exceptions, and I was long overdue in trying Anita Brookner.  In this novel Brookner exhibits strong literary prowess in her impeccable use of the language. Nary a word is wasted in this tight, fast-moving novel.  I was entirely immersed in this book for the gripping nature of the plot as well as the empathy I felt for the characters.  An absolutely fabulous read!  I'm now onto _Hotel du Lac_ and have no doubt it will be an equally engaging read.	2003-02-05

With a very even hand  Trollope allows us to see into the motivations of his characters and truly  come to understand why they've done the things they've done, and how they  justify their actions.  Instead of preaching religion, which clearly isn't  Trollope's style, he chooses to take a more liberal look at the underlying  morality of the actions of his characters.  'Dr. Wortle's School' has a  very modern ring for a Victorian novel, and the themes and characters could  easily have been depicted by Joanna rather than Anthony Trollope.  Add to  that the mysterious tone of Wilkie Collins and you have a very satisfying  Victorian novel.	2000-09-12

It works as a whole,  in that the main and supporting characters are very fully-fleshed and we  have the chance to really like and understand them.  Some elements, such as  the mentally ill mother, seemed familiar and almost drawn from other novels  I've read, but even these characters maintained a fresh quality that kept  me interested.  My only complaint is the final 1/4 stretch in which the  main character, Mary/Marty, seems to spend a lot of time feeling sorry for  herself.  I know such is human, but for me a whine is still a whine..  However, even this doesn't tarnish the lovely prose and the well-paced  plot.  Definitely a recommended read.	2000-09-12

Two writers, working side by side, living their lives to the fullest, John Bayley and Iris Murdoch weren't so much a marriage as a  team.  Their support for each other's craft is laudable, and Bayley's  reaction to losing his wife while she was still alive is heartbreaking and  at times oddly humourous.  You feel what Bayley must have felt, looking at  the shell of the woman he'd spent most of his life with and hoping there  was still some of her inside somewhere, and you laugh and cry right along  with him.  This book is a loving tribute to one of the greatest modern  novelists and philosophers who ever lived, and I felt greatly enriched  after reading this book.  It has stayed with me ever since.	2000-07-21

The novel deals with religious fanatacism, portrays atheism, and is  overall a very balanced treatment of the subject of religion at the time.  There is humour, a bit of melodrama, and suspense.  It was a joy to read  and I look forward to reading more Fanny Trollope titles in the future.	2000-07-21
