I'm sure HF was going for a tongue-in-cheek, fun, \\"Jane\\" Bond type story, but it just doesn't work.  It's not funny.  It's not coherent.  It stinks.	2004-09-16
US	39682476	R2ZJFEJTR6ZUS7	0767912268	873187256	To Have and To Hold	Books	4	0	0	N	N	I just want to give my opinion about the new title.	I read this book when it first came out in the UK.  It was originally called Spellbound.  Unfortunately, there was nothing spellbinding about it.  It was billed as something with a mystical air about it, because of the Rachel Danbury character.  As you get into the book, you will find that the Rachel character plays only a tiny part in the story. The title alone (Spellbound) left me feeling  a bit cheated and disappointed. The best thing that ever happened to this book was that it was re-titled before being released in the USA. The content of the book is exactly the same, but new readers won't have any false expectations.  \\"To Have and To Hold\\" is a much more suitable title.  Anyway, enjoy the book.  It's really a great read.	2004-09-10

The story developed well and kept a nice pace throughout.  If you are a devoted DS fan, as I am, you won't be disappointed.	2004-07-07

I listened to the unabridged audiobook and let me tell you, it was almost painful at times.  I am a big fan of CC's books, but I literally had to force myself to finish this one.  In my opinion, BLINDSIDE is the worst book ever written.  If you've never read any of CC's books, please don't start with this one! Avoid it at all costs!	2004-05-13

I just want to say:  I could not put this book down.  I devoured it in one sitting. Of course, now I wish I had read slower and savored every page.  But I couldn't help myself.  I just gobbled it up.  Buy this book today.  You won't be sorry.  Happy Eating...I mean Reading!!!	2004-04-14

In 'The Other Woman', EJD gives the reader a raw, explicit, gutwrenching, and all too real example of adultery and its resulting fallout. If you've ever been cheated on...you need to read this book.  If you've ever cheated on your spouse...you REALLY need to read this book.	2004-03-29

I listened to the unabridged audiobook and was on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  Unfortunately, a lot of reviewers seem to be incensed over the violence in this book.  The reason I wasn't angry was because it's HISTORICAL romance. Furthermore, it's FICTION.  If your going to take this book verbatim and/or judge the behavior in 1277 by 2004 standards, you probably shouldn't bother with this book.  I suggest you just enjoy the book for what it is...ENTERTAINMENT.	2004-01-21

I sighed, I cried...I want to read it again already (and I just finished reading it). This book is a must read! I highly recommend it, but do yourself a favor and read 'The Notebook' first. I guarantee that you will be just as enchanted by Noah, Allie, Jane and Wilson as I was.	2003-12-16

The way Rose handled being dumped by her husband (and employer) was remarkable. <BR>This book offers a different perspective on handling an all too common crisis.  While other books portray the scorned wife seeking revenge, this one shows you that sometimes &quot;revenge&quot; takes care of itself.	2003-11-12

I really wanted to love &quot;Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married&quot; but it bored me to tears.  It was pretty obvious, early on, who Lucy would end up with.  I forced myself to read half of it and then I gave up.  I skipped to the epilogue, confirmed the obvious, and called it a day.  Oh well, hopefully &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; will be much better.	2003-09-05

I know people call his novels predictable (and they are), but I don't care. I love it when I can exclaim \\"I knew it\\".  It doesn't take away one iota of the enjoyment I feel when reading or listening to one of his novels.  Say what you will....I love Nicholas Sparks!	2003-08-07

It was a nice change of pace from the author's usual theme. However, I must complain about the reader. Bill Andrew Quinn's voice was all wrong for this book. His voice was annoying and took something away from an otherwise enjoyable book. Thieves' Paradise was worthy of three stars, but because of Mr. Quinn's terrible reading, I gave it two stars.	2002-12-28

I won't take up space and give you a summary of this book; my review has a different purpose.  I just wanted to say: I LOVED THIS BOOK!  I am a die-hard Danielle Steel fan and always will be, but I must admit that her last few books haven't been her best work.  However, at long last, the author seems to have recaptured that \\"special something\\" that has been missing in her recent works. I could not put this book down.  I devoured it in one sitting.  I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2002-11-11

It was truly refreshing to read a book with a plus-sized main character---and still plus-sized on the final page---who was okay with it. I recommend this book to everyone....but especially to my plus-sized sisters all over the world. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. :)	2002-10-09

Were it not for his superb reading, I would have given this book 1 star.  I'm a huge Grisham fan, but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers....this book stunk. It's almost as if someone else wrote it. There was none of his trademark &quot;gripping suspense&quot;, the story didn't flow very well, and the ending was just terrible (too abrupt, too many loose ends).	2002-07-24

If ever there was a book that shouldn't have been written, this is it.  This epilogue was terrible. The Bridges of Madison County was such a triumph.  It was perfect. It left you wanting more, but in a good way. It made you wonder &quot;what if&quot; and allowed you to let your mind wander in a million different directions.  Robert James Waller should have left well enough alone.  It wish I had never read this epilogue.  What a disappointment.	2002-05-22

The author must have fallen asleep after eating too much seafood, had a nightmare, woke up, wrote it down, and then had it published. <BR>Patricia Cornwell is so much better than this book implies. If you've never read one of her novels before, please don't start with this one. <BR>I highly recommend all of her other books.	2002-05-18
US	39682476	R3AQKTMU9UKTMH	0385335520	52235556	The Cottage	Books	3	3	3	N	N	An enjoyable and quick read.	The Cottage is not Ms. Steel's best work, but it was an enjoyable and quick read. I thought it was unfortunate that Ms. Steel chose to make her main character, Cooper Winslow (an ageing Hollywood legend), so unlikable. I simply could not warm up to him. Coop, was so shallow, immature and self-involved. And worse still, at 70, he preferred dating (and sleeping with) women in there early 20's. Yikes!... <BR>Having said that, it was nice to read a romance novel that revolved primarily around men. I thoroughly enjoyed the side stories that involved Mark Friedman (freshly dumped by his cheatin' wife) and Jimmy O'Connor (recently widowed).  All-in-all, it was a good read.	2002-05-09

I have listened to all of Jane Austen's novels in the unabridged audiobook form.  Sense and Sensibility (narrated by Sarah Badel) is my personal favorite.

After having listened to both Bridget Jones novels (beautifully read by Tracie Bennett), Cause Celeb was a huge let down.  It was the anti-Bridget Jones.
