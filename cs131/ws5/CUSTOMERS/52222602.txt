I think this should be required reading for anyone planning an extended stay in Paris (like a semester or Junior year abroad).  I spent my Junior year of college in Paris and I wish I'd been able to read \\"Almost French\\" first, so I wouldn't think it was my fault that the French were cold and unfriendly to me and I couldn't make friends with anyone except other expats.  Or that I was the only person in the world who thinks the French are too obsessed with appearances.  Yes, it's true that there is not much about Frederic and their relationship in the book -- and not a scrap of sex anywhere -- but juicy, sexy books are a dime-a-dozen.  I think Ms. Turnbull is just too classy and discreet to get into those details, and frankly, for me, it didn't detract from the book at all.  She comes across as someone I could be friends with. Bravo!	2005-07-26

Compared to Maryjane, Martha Stewart's fantasies seem downright attainable!  I read about this book in the Boston Globe and thought, \\"This sounds so nauseating, I HAVE to go to Borders and check it out.\\"  I mean, anyone who calls her book a \\"Lifebook\\" turns me off from the start -- who is the target audience that needs to be told how to LIVE?  And the book was nauseating, indeed.  I can't imagine it would be of interest to anyone other than people who want to become organic, self-sustaining farmgirls and therefore need helpful hints on sharpening a hoe and operating a wringer washer.  It doesn't even have much visual appeal, unlike Martha's books with their gorgeous photos.  An interview with one of MJ's friends listed her secrets for cooking success, which included \\"hugs\\" and \\"smiles.\\"  Gag.  And the recipes were completely unappealing - I mean, chicken or salmon gelatin molds made with seaweed extract? Popcorn sprinkled with yeast powder?  There was a recipe involving venison that started with \\"After hunting and butchering your venison...\\" Not to mention that most of them require you to buy Maryjane's mixes -- in fact, much of the book is simply advertising for her products. (And I thought the embroidered pillows and linens were pretty ugly, too.) The Globe's reviewer tried several recipes and said none were better than just OK.  And, by the way, I find the tone of Maryjane's website to be unbearably smug.	2005-07-18

I'm a big Sedaris fan and was really looking forward to this book. Even though I knew the short stories were not written by him, I figured he probably has excellent taste and that at least some of the stories might be similar to his own work.  WRONG.  I slogged through about four of the stories, plus just the first few pages of about three others, and then gave up and returned this to the library.  All of the stories were dismally boring and pointless. They reminded me of the stuff English teachers make you read -- loads and loads of descriptive detail, but NOTHING happens.  I'm sorry, call me a philistine, but I like something with a plot or at least some sort of \\"arc\\" or character development -- not reading two pages devoted to how a character puts cream and sugar in his coffee.  Some of these stories really read like isolated chapters pulled out of novels -- they really didn't stand alone at all.	2005-07-11

Ms. Sittenfeld was fairly accurate in her depiction of prep-school life -- I'll give her that.  But for a much more interesting look at prep school, and getting inside the mind of a messed-up prep-school student, read Sean Wilsey's memoir, \\"Oh the Glory of it All.\\"  (And Wilsey's book is a fabulous read for other reasons, too.)	2005-06-30

First of all, the recipes in this book are NOT especially \\"quick and easy, so you can spend more time on the beach.\\"  Most of them looked pretty time-consuming to me.  Secondly, they're all recipes that you probably already have:  Gazpacho, grilled shrimp, lobster rolls, mango salsa, pasta salads with chicken, lemon-glazed poundcake with berries, apple crisp...  I have to confess that I didn't try any of them (because nothing seemed the slightest bit new or original).

There were some very interesting parts about her early days struggling to make it in New York and her fascinating trips to India, Africa, Italy, etc.  But there were also some Spiritual Growth and Philosophy of Life sections which were really dull, and which I skipped over.  Also I was disappointed that she doesn't delve deeply into so many things that could have been interesting; she hardly discusses many of her films, and mentions her kids, husbands, lovers and co-stars only very quickly and superficially.  It's like she'd signed confidentiality agreements with everyone connected with her, or at least was bound and determined to be totally nice and not upset anyone by revealing anything personal about them.  You gotta admire her for being classy and not catty, but it makes the book rather unsatisfying.  Also, the photographs are sort of randomly inserted into the book and don't correspond to the text at all; for example, when Goldie was going on and on about her sister and their wonderful trip to Italy together, I hunted and hunted for pix of her sister and finally gave up -- but then I came across them much later in the book.  On the whole, I liked Jane Fonda's memoir a lot more.	2005-06-08

I've always been a fan of Jane's, even though I was very let down when she got breast implants.  I found the book extremely interesting and difficult to put down.  I also learned a LOT about the Vietnam war -- something I've always been painfully ignorant about, partly because I was a baby while it was happening.  Sometimes the psychobabble gets a bit heavy, but she tries hard to be evenhanded and fair -- about her own mistakes as well as those of others in her life, like the ex-husbands.  I definitely got the impression, though, that she was a total absentee mother.  It's like, \\"I gave birth to Vanessa, turned her over to a nanny and then spent the next two years on a cross-country road trip protesting the Vietnam war.\\"  And she makes very little acknowledgment or apology for that.  Still, I like  her, and I liked the book. If you are a Jane fan, be sure to rent the documentary, \\"Searching for Debra Winger,\\" which has an interesting interview with Jane.	2005-05-26

Also I just like the design, layout and tone of her books, the very clear instructions, her chatty intro to each recipe, and all the helpful tips that appear in the sidebars.

(But unfortunately they were all in my gut and I couldn't zip any of my pants.)  Having tried unsuccessfully to lose it \\"sensibly\\" by cutting fats, sugar and junk, not eating after dinner, exercising more, etc., I finally got so desperate that I decided to try the SBD even though I've heard all the stuff about how bad low-carb diets are.  Well, I stuck strictly to Phase I for exactly a week and didn't cheat once.  I did feel very hungry, had trouble sleeping, and breakfast was especially hard because I much prefer grains and fruit to eggs.  BUT my pants got loose right away, my gut shrank dramatically, and I think I lost at least 7 lbs. that week.  (I don't have easy access to a good scale.)  I was delighted. However, after about 2 days on Phase 2 (adding small portions of high-fiber carbs to breakfast and lunch), I could tell I'd gained back a lot  -- i.e., just like everyone says, most of my initial loss was WATER.  Net FAT loss - probably 2-3 lbs.    <br />I've pretty much given up on the diet and am just trying to eat healthy, low-fat and high fiber.  The SBD did help me get off sugar \\"cold turkey\\", and I must give Dr. A. credit for good recipes, in both the diet book and the cookbook.  All the recipes I tried were very good.

By now Anna had dumped Joe Blow and was having a torrid affair with .....\\" and it goes on like this for the rest of the book. <br />  It's a completely unbalanced hatchet job -- nothing but endless quotes from people saying that she's horrible, icy, manipulative, etc. and that her success is largely due to her father's power and connections in the publishing world.  And for some reason the other loves to harp on the fact that Wintour WEARS HER HAIR IN A BOB (ohmiGOD!), and he devotes pages and pages to this, as if it's absolutely earthshaking.

I lived in France for a year and have visited it several times since.  Mme. Guiliano's advice is authentically French, honest and non-gimmicky -- I think most French women (and probably women in lots of other European countries) eat this way.  (And she has special credibility, having lived in the U.S. and gotten fat eating our diet.)  There are no magic bullets here, and a lot of what she says is stuff you've heard before -- for example, cut down on snacking, reduce portion sizes, eat QUALITY food, and really sit down and FOCUS on your food when you eat -- don't read, watch TV, etc.  But it's GOOD advice and bears repeating!  I'm reading the book a second time to shore up my motivation.    As to the \\"But French women smoke!\\" protests -- yes, they do, and that may contribute to their thinness (as does their espresso consumption, which supposedly increases metabolism and can suppress appetite).  But smoking and espresso alone do not make you thin -- look at all the fat Americans who smoke!  And, whether they smoke or not, I believe most French women do eat the way MG suggests.  I found the book very well-written and motivating, and the design and illustrations are appealing, too.  I probably will never attempt the \\"Magic Leek Soup\\" (imagine the onion breath!?!) -- nor will I make my own yogurt -- but I am trying to eat more yogurt and fruit in place of junky snacks, keep pushing the water, look for better-quality chocolate (which will make me feel satisfied with less), and follow some of her other advice.  Sometimes, when I'm tempted to have a second helping of dessert, I think to myself, \\"No, Mireille would NOT do that.\\" I might even try some of the recipes.  I did think her  heavy promotion of Champagne was pretty funny -- but understandable in light of her job.  I hope she will follow this up with a cookbook and/or a French fashion tricks book (I think she dresses very well -- like all Frenchies!)      By the way, if you like this book, you might try to get hold ofa copy of \\"The Beautiful People's Diet Book\\" by Luciana Avedon.  It's from the 70s and out of print, but Ms. Avedon is Italian and her common-sense, no-nonsense philosophy is similar to Guiliano's.  I found it helpful.	2005-03-05

I couldn't put this book down -- and not only is it a page-turner, it's a WELL-WRITTEN page turner.  Ms. Haigh is a master of descriptive detail -- yet she doesn't waste a word.  Every detail is important and reveals something about a character -- unlike some authors who feel compelled to recite pages of mundane details that serve no purpose.

The book certainly made me more sympathetic to Mr. Walton, and made me admire the incredible hard work that he put into his business.  I like Wal-Mart and think its success is deserved.  But a lot of the book's chapters were just laundry lists of \\"Then we opened store #140... then our revenues topped $10 billion.... then I fired this guy and replaced him with that guy...\\".  There were some fun anecdotes about successes and failures that Wal-Mart had along the way (like the exploding watermelons and donkey piss!) -- but not enough of them.

The section on Bernadine Healy of the Red Cross is particularly sloppy and confusing. She resigned one month after 9/11 and there is no explanation at all of WHY she did.  And another thing that annoyed me -- purely stylistic -- is the fact that all the interviewees keep repeating the author's name again and again (\\"You know, Harvey...\\" \\"You're right, Harvey...\\").

I thought I would LOVE this book -- I love to cook and to read about the food and cooking industries -- but I really found it boring and hard to get through.  The only parts that were worthwhile were the sections on Julia Child and on the evolution of Betty Crocker.  But I thought Shapiro went on WAY too long about Poppy Cannon, with too much biographical data that really didn't have anything to do with Cannon's work or her influence on cooking.  Too much of the book just seemed to be laundry lists of yucky-sounding '50s recipes and failed products by the food industry.  And I thought her efforts in the final chapter to draw similarities between Betty Friedan and Julia Child were bizarre.  That made no sense to me at all, and it seemed to me that she only did that to end the book on a provocative, pseudo-political note. I can't help thinking the glowing reviews of this book that appeared in the media were chiefly a result of Shapiro having a lot of good connections.	2004-06-23

Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette, and Me	Books	4	63	72	N	N	An entertaining read if you are a John & Carolyn buff	Before reading this book I'd always had the impression that Carolyn B-K was a shallow, status-conscious golddigger.  After all, the only guys she dated seemed to be models, tycoons, football-team captains, etc.  Well, this book not only confirms all of the above, but also tells you that she was incredibly hard-hearted, cruel, dishonest and manipulative in her dealings with men!  (Besides which, she didn't seem to understand the concept of contraception.  I mean, THREE abortions in five years?)       I am absolutely shocked by the reviewer from NY who defended CBK by saying that she was \\"just like any other woman\\" -- GOD!  *I* am certainly not like this shallow bitch, nor are any of my friends.  She treated Michael Bergin like s***, using him as a sex toy when it was convenient for her and then dumping him when better prospects came along.  But then, after she'd dumped him, she'd throw tantrums and trash his apartment if she discovered he was seeing other women.  What's really sad is how long Bergin put up with this s*** and believed her lies.  It amazes me how many men find psycho-bitches attractive, and get bored with those of us who are reasonable, sane and nice.  Bergin comes across as sweet, but a bit dim and naive.  (I practically laughed out loud when he kept repeating how \\"classy\\" he thought CBK was -- after her incredibly slutty and obnoxious behavior, and let's not forget about wearing a thong in Hyannisport!) And apparently JFK Jr. was just as dumb as Bergin.       At least Bergin (or his editors) had the sense to stick to the interesting stuff and not try to pad the book with a lot of extraneous stuff about his childhood, his grandparents' childhood, etc.  The book moves along at a very good clip, and the stuff he tells about life as a male model was interesting, too (though depressing).	2004-04-11

(Especially the relentless Hillary-bashing!)  And I agree with a lot of the reviewers that Ms. Blyth seems unnecessarily catty and vicious about a lot of her colleagues, as well as about a lot of famous people (e.g., Susan Sarandon).  Frankly I'm surprised that she's burning so many bridges!  However, I still found it an excellent read.  Sure, an educated woman may already know that the women's mags are full of crap, but I'm not sure that teenagers do.  I certainly was very influenced by those mags when I was a kid -- in fact, I'm sure that Seventeen had a lot to do with my becoming anorexic and then bulimic.  And finally, I was relieved to learn that other women are as fed up with the clownish garbage that passes for &quot;fashion&quot; these days.	2004-04-04

For me, watching Ruth Yancey Fox ruthlessly destroy the lives of everyone in her family was just too depressing.  I probably wouldn't have even finished this if I hadn't been on vacation.  I thought Ruth should have had her comeuppance a lot earlier in the story, and then there would have been a LITTLE more joy and happiness instead of grinding misery for the whole damn book.  I also thought the depiction of the black servants was a bit racist and patronizing.  (The old warmhearted-but-dimwitted stereotype.)	2004-03-03

In fact, I considered not continuing with the book after about 50 pages of Idyllic Life On The Mountain and Great Sex With My Husband.  But the Italian stuff was interesting.  <BR>   I haven't read all of her books yet, but Colony is fabulous and so were Downtown and Up Island.  Outer Banks was pretty good, too.

I don't think this book was promoted very well when it was published.  I just happened upon it in a used book store and picked it up because my stepmother had recently died of ovarian cancer-- and also because I'm always interested in reading about the fashion world.  Tilberis sometimes came across as a bit shallow; she apparently took the whole fashion world VERY seriously, instead of viewing it with the detachment and &quot;Well, it's a living&quot; attitude of some fashionistas I know.  Also, after describing her very long struggle to have children, which ultimately resulted in her adopting two sons, she seemed to have taken little interest in raising them; her husband pretty much was a single parent, while she lived and breathed Harper's Bazaar 24/7. <BR>   But on the whole, I really enjoyed the book, especially the insider stuff about the fashion business.  I also appreciated the thorough information that Tilberis gives about detection and treatment of ovarian cancer.  By the end of the book she seems resigned to dying fairly soon, but is just trying to enjoy every day that is left to her.  She died within two years of the book's publication.	2003-11-01

I had intended to get this out of the library before deciding whether to buy it or not.  But I happened upon it at a bookstore and, after perusing it for a few minutes, decided that I just HAD to have it. It is CRAMMED with terrific recipes, ideas and hints, and has become one of my all-time favorites!  Almost everything is quick and easy to make, with very precise instructions.  Most things are not horrifically fattening, or at least they can be made successfully with low-fat substitutions.  Standouts that have become staples in our house include the Nacho Cheese Soup, Mac & Cheese, Corn/Potato Chowder, Dun-buttered muffins, Asian Chicken Salad, Sour cream-cinnamon loaf and John's Summertime Slaw.  I would say 98% of the recipes I've tried have worked beautifully.       One thing I like about this book is that there are not a lot of shameless repeats and recyclings, as there are in the cake books.  In this book she gives you variations on the recipe in a small box or sidebar, rather than creating a \\"new\\" recipe simply by changing the name and one ingredient. And, like the other books, it's very well written in Anne's chatty and unpretentious style.  Right on, Anne!	2003-10-30

I probably shouldn't even contribute since I only read about 25 pages of this, but I just couldn't &quot;get into&quot; this book because I found the author's writing style self-consciously quaint (maybe &quot;twee&quot; is the right word), boring, and overall irritating.  It's a pet peeve of mine when an author refers to a character by his full name EVERY SINGLE TIME he mentions the character -- for example, &quot;Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni did this.  Then Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni did that.  Then Mma. Ramotswe asked Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni to do this for her...&quot;  Tedious!  Is there some literary value to that endless repetition that I'm not aware of?	2003-08-16

I love the original Healthy Homestyle Cooking and use it constantly -- however, I've always thought the sweets and baked goods were the weakest part of the cookbook. And unfortunately that problem is magnified in this book.  She cuts too much fat and salt out of everything, and the flavor and texture of the final products really suffer.  Most of her muffins and quick breads are either rubbery and tough, or dense and soggy, because she replaces every last drop of oil or butter with applesauce.  Also, H.H. Desserts has many repeats within itself as well as repeats from her first book.  The same cheesecake and muffin recipes are repeated again and again, with just a tiny change in flavorings, fruit, name, etc.  AND -- rather importantly -- sometimes the calorie savings from her \\"makeovers\\" are so small that it's not worth the huge compromise in taste and texture.  I mean, sometimes her cookie \\"makeovers\\" only shave about 20 calories per cookie -- but they definitely don't taste as good as the original.  And did anyone notice that many of the muffins are jumbo-sized?  That's to make the calorie and fat savings look more dramatic. <br />  For best results with Tribole's muffin and quick bread recipes, always add about 1/2 teaspoon salt, a few tablespoons of oil (in addition to the applesauce she calls for), and when she calls for two egg whites, use a whole egg instead.  You'll get far better results and you'll still have a healthy, low-fat product. And you won't waste mountains of egg yolks, which I think is criminal!	2003-04-18

How can anyone write a fashion book with so few photographs?  When you're talking about a particular RL collection or ad campaign and whether it was successful or not, the reader wants to be reminded of what the \\"Prairie\\" look was, or the Annie-Hall inspired collection, or the NY Times advertising spread, or whatever.  And there are almost no pictures of any of the many players involved, which contributes to the reader's difficulty in keeping all the names straight.  The book is obviously intended as a hatchet job -- there are constant, snippy reminders of how narcissistic and perfectionistic he is, but reading between the lines, you also get the impression that there ARE some people who LIKE to work for him.  I am no big fan of Lauren's, but Gross obviously has a vendetta against him. Too bad, because this boring book could have been really interesting.<br />  And, in response to the comment by another reviewer: NO, I do NOT work for Ralph Lauren!  I don't even buy his clothes!  I am just interested in the fashion industry, and there are many other, better fashion books. (And, BTW, I liked Gross's \\"Models\\" book.)	2003-02-22

I agree with the reviewer from Phoenix who says this book seems to have been rushed out in order to capitalize on the success of the first two books.  There is just nothing in here that I have any desire to make (or that I don't already have a million good recipes for).    Also, a stylistic thing that drives me nuts: nearly every single recipe in all her cookbooks is attributed to \\"My dear friend [so-and-so]\\" -- OK, we get it, Ina, everyone loves you -- and her constant chirping of \\"How easy is that?\\" starts to grate after a while.	2003-01-20

On the hunch that this book would probably have a lot of reruns from the first book, I took it out of the library rather than buying it.  And I was right -- there are a lot of exact repeats, plus a lot of repeats with chocolate or cocoa added (or using a chocolate cake mix instead of the original yellow, white, spice, etc).  In some instances the recipes don't sound very appetizing --  I mean, Chocolate Pumpkin Cake?  Chocolate Spice Cake? <BR>   For me, there are more than enough chocolate recipes in the first book. Frankly, I wish she would do a lower-fat book.  But probably the cakes would taste even more like cake mix if they weren't loaded up with extra butter, chocolate, sour cream, etc.<BR>However, I did try the &quot;Darn Good Chocolate Cake&quot; with low-fat sour cream and no chocolate chips, and it still turned out very well.

Another problem -- many of the ingredients are hard to find (even in the sophisticated greater Boston area!) and she relies heavily on fresh herbs in practically every recipe, which is just not practical for me.

This book is VERY well written and fun to read, and loaded with good hints on baking in general, why cake mixes taste and perform the way they do, etc. But my results have been mixed. So far I've tried the Fresh Orange Cake, the lemon cake that follows two pages later, and the Macadamia Fudge Torte, all of which were outstanding. But the Double Chocolate Chewies (cookies), Peanut Butter Chocolate Bars, Pumpkin Spice Cake, and Banana Loaves were just OK. The Apple Walnut Crisp, while extremely easy, was not very good -- it tasted like what it was:  apple pie filling with dry cake mix on top and then a full cup (ouch!) of melted butter poured on top!  And my real disaster was the Zesty Cranberry Cake (one of the few low-fat ones). It tasted like baby aspirin, besides being dense and heavy, and my husband and I couldn't swallow it, even though we love cranberries.    I have a few general complaints also. One, I wish there were more light/ low fat recipes. Most of the recipes are \\"doctored\\" by adding extra eggs and LOTS of fat to them (among other things), and I can't bring myself to put that stuff into my body very often.   Second, she recommends using an electric mixer for just about every recipe (I assume to give the illusion of \\"quick and easy\\"), but some of the doughs are much too stiff to use the mixer unless you have a very strong commercial machine. Third, there are a LOT of repeats in the book!  For example, the Chocolate Better-than-Sex Cake is exactly the same recipe as the Darn Good Chocolate Cake, and there are many other repeats, sometimes with tiny variations, and sometimes with nothing more than a name change or a different type of pan. And finally, I do a lot of from-scratch baking and I really don't find that using a mix saves me that much time. After all, mixing your dry ingredients only takes a few minutes. With Byrn's recipes you still have to zest the lemons, melt the butter, grease & flour the pan, wash the dishes, etc.    I think this book is best for those whose scratch recipes mysteriously fail, because Byrn's recipes are pretty foolproof and avoid your having to measure dry ingreds precisely (which is often the cause of scratch-baking failures). If you're good at scratch baking and have the few extra minutes to mix your dry ingreds., you should probably stick with scratch for best results!    I DO recommend her \\"Dinner Doctor\\" book, though -- it's one of my all-time favorites, and I use it constantly.	2002-03-07
