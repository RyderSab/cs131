It is the best introductory grammar of Latin that I've come across.<br />People bring to the study of a foreign language different expectations, different levels of linguistic sophistication, and different learning styles.  So it's no surprise that there are a wide variety of reactions to Wheelock's text.  I think it's the best for the following reasons:<br />1. It doesn't assume you know a lot of grammar - they don't just drop 'demonstrative pronoun' and 'subjunctive' on you; the concepts are explained clearly.<br />2. Lessons contain one or two grammatical points, with many examples of their proper use.<br />3. Practice exercises (and answers!) are given in the rear of the book.  You could also buy the companion exercise book if you want, but caveat emptor! - the answers are not included.  (I wrote to Harper Collins, and they sent me the URL and password for the website that contains the answers.)<br />For my money, it's the best and gentlest introduction to Latin available, and it's suitable for all ages, from high school on up.  With Wheelock under your belt, you'll be ready to take on annotated readings, and hit some of the more advanced grammars.	2003-11-30

If you're interested in the Sanskrit language, whether for linguistic or philosophical reasons, this is the book you should start with.<br />It introduces the script and the grammar in slow, gentle steps.  After about 7 lessons, you ease into the different kinds of external sandhi (sound changes and assimilations from one word to another).  By the end of the first volume, you've learned a suprising amount: most of the major declensions, and been introduced to the verb, and the principles of compound formation.<BR>Every lesson has plenty of exercises, both English to Sanskrit and vice versa, to test your comprehension and to give you practice.  The answers to the exercises are given in the back of the book.<br />Just a great, great introduction to the language.  After finishing Book I, you can continue with his Book II, or pick up, with confidence, any of the standard academic introductions - Maurer, Goldman and Sutherland, Deshpande, even (gasp!) Coulson.<br />I wish every ancient language had an introductory book like this.	2003-08-24

Although the economic situation has changed since this book was written (Americans no longer tremble before the Japanese juggernaut), the advice in this book is certainly still relevant.<br />Humorous and to-the-point, the author points out the follies still rampant in traditional American management style - the caste system of hourly and salaried workers, the unwillingness to engage the workforce, the traditional appraisal system, \\"Management By Objective\\", and the failure to view the business as a web of interconnected micro-processes. His argument is based on the philosophy of Dr. Deming and other leading quality practitioners.<br />True - American business has changed somewhat, but we're not as good as we think we are.

Although it's not suitable as a stand-alone introduction to Japanese, it's an excellent supplement to whatever text or course you're using (I'm using Jorden's Japanese - The Spoken Language).<br />It recognizes that there are only 3 basic sentence types in Japanese (Nominal, Adjectival, and Verbal), and even the most complex sentences are just an elaboration of one or another of these sentence types.  The author presents 50 sentence patterns, with over 60 variations.  Each pattern and variation is explained (in English!), and for each pattern, there are a number of sample sentences in Japanese script, romanization (Hepburn), and an English translation.  Included in these representative sentences are many short dialogues, as well.  The majority use the distal-style, but there are a good number illustrating the plain / direct style as well.<br />By internalizing these basic patterns, I think the learner will develop a sound basis for continued progress in Japanese.  I'm glad I bought it.	2002-08-10

First things first ... this book does NOT have 57 pages...it has over 360 pages. (I hope this mistake hasn't deterred any potential buyers!)<br />There aren't that many introductory grammars of Old French lying around in English, and fewer yet that don't assume a thorough knowledge of Latin. (Einhorn's Old French is the only other one that comes to mind).<br />This excellent book is composed of 23 lessons. Each lesson begins with a passage in Old French, and is followed by a section with the appropriate grammar and syntax. Each lesson ends with a section on phonology; they trace the evolution of of the Vulgar Latin sound system into Old French. I think for students of Romance philology, these are worth the price of the book by themselves.<br />The first 15 lessons cover Le Fresne, by Marie de France, in the standard Francien dialect; later lessons introduce texts in the Anglo-Norman and Picard dialects.<br />The only drawback that I see in this book is the lack of vocabularies for the individual lessons. Every form of every word used in the lesson readings is included in the glossary in the back, so working through the reading involves looking up EVERY LITTLE WORD that you don't know in the dictionary in the back. Great way to internalize the grammar and learn the vocabulary, but not everyone will have the stomach for this tedious word-by-word torture.<br />A knowledge of Latin certainly wouldn't hurt, but for the seriously motivated student, this book is the best thing going.	2002-03-27

He uses an interesting approach; the grammatical forms and structures that are most used by Latin writers are introduced early in the course.  So you've got indirect speech in Lesson 1, and the subjunctive in lesson 2.  Other less common structures (like the future tense) are not introduced until later lessons.<br />Definitely not the standard presentation, and kind of quirky, but there's an attractive logic to it.  A big plus is the fact that there are a lot of drills and translation exercises, and the answers are given in the back of the book so you can check yourself.<br />Bottom-line, it's not for the faint of heart - you need a lot of stamina to stick with it, and a good deal of linguistic sophistication doesn't hurt.  But the price is right, you get a lot of real Latin right off the bat, and the answers to the readings and exercises are there to help.  I'm using it as a supplement to Wheelock, and I think it's doing me a lot of good.  Try it!	2002-02-12

But I enjoy learning languages, and I know what works for me.  #2:  I'm only on lesson 7; I have not worked through the whole book.<br />This is one of the finest teaching grammars I have ever seen.  It consists of 26 lessons, with exercises at the end of each. (The answers to the exercises are given in the back of the book.)  The early lessons cover the sounds and the script, and Professor Allen moves on to the grammar beginning with lesson 4.  The author does not assume ANY grammatical knowledge on the part of the learner; before getting into the Egyptian forms he explains, for example, what an adjective or an adverb is, and how they are used in English.<br />Each lesson introduces several related points of grammar, and there are plenty of examples given (Almost all the examples are given in hieroglyphs, with the transcription and a translation.).   The short sample sentences at the end of each lesson illustrate and reinforce the grammar from the current lesson, as well as previous ones.  And as I said, the answers to the exercises, and translations of all sample sentences are given so you can gauge your progress and understanding.  Each lesson ends with a short essay about one aspect or another of the culture of Ancient Egypt.  At the rear of the book there is a sign list modelled after Gardiner, and a dictionary of most of the words introduced in the lessons.<br />This is not &quot;Hieroglyphs for Dummies&quot;; you're going to need a lot of stamina and determination to work through this entire book.

But if you're seriously interested in the language and culture of Ancient Egypt, and are willing to invest the time and energy, this is the textbook you want.	2001-05-28

This is absolutely necessary.<br />2.  Most words have several examples, and they are given in romanization, written in Japanese, and translated into English.<br />3.

The Japanese writing system is arguably the most difficult in the world. Having 2 syllabaries (hiragana and katakana) is difficult enough, but then throw in the kanji, with their multiple readings, you've got a tremendous obstacle to overcome.<br />One of the principles of mnemonics is that if you have something that is basically meaningless, you won't be able to remember it unless you invest it with some meaning, even artificial.  And here's the beauty of Heisig's system: he gives the squiggles and strokes MEANING.  He starts off with simple strokes and characters, and he develops an &quot;imaginative alphabet&quot;; for example, a down stroke turns into a walking stick; a square with a line across the middle is a mouth and a tongue; a couple of diagonal lines becomes a pair of scissors.  By combining these fanciful images, he gradually introduces more and more elements, combining them into concrete objects that can be readily visualized and remembered.  Each character is given an (English) keyword, and even the most complex character can be made concrete via this system. For example, the horrendous-looking character for &quot;fight&quot; can be decomposed into the component elements of &quot;gates&quot;, &quot;table&quot;, and &quot;glue&quot;.  By making a bizarre association between these elements, the total character can be easily remembered. He gives a lot of guidance to building these mental images early in the book, less as you gain practice.<br />Lastly, a criticism and a suggestion. Some of his mental images are not concrete enough.  For example, he provides keywords such as &quot;happenstance&quot; and &quot;usual&quot; and &quot;jurisdiction&quot;.  How can you remember something abstract like that? To be effective, you'll probably want to make up more easily visualized examples for these.  The suggestion: as long as you're making up a ridiculous / bizarre / sexy image to remember the character, why not include the pronunciation (on and kun readings) along with it?  A little extra embellishment to the tableau, and you've got the sound as well. For example, any character with the reading &quot;KO&quot;, I'll throw a can of Coke into the picture. The &quot;JI&quot; sound gets Jesus into the mix, and &quot;TO&quot; includes an image of my big toe. (you get the idea).<br />Learning the kanji is a daunting task. Any mnemonic system such as this one is vastly superior to dumb, brute-force repetition.  Take his ideas, improve on them when they don't make a strong impression, and you'll be amazed at your progress.	2001-02-18

If you have an interest in the Icelandic language, you've definitely been frustrated by the lack of learning materials for English-speakers.  Looks like Routledge is coming out with a &quot;Colloquial Icelandic&quot; sometime this summer (finally!), so that will definitely fill a huge void.  Even so, I believe Einarsson's book will still fill a need.<br />It employs an interesting methodology.  In my 1945 edition, pages 1-31 give a very thorough introduction to the pronunciation. (too bad there are not accompanying tapes.)  Pages 32-104 give the grammar (nouns, pronouns, verbs, in table form).  Pages 105-180 covers syntax, with English translations of all sample phrases and sentences.  Pages 181-246 is the pedagogical &quot;heart&quot; of the book; it consists of &quot;aefingar&quot; (exercises, drills).  They are short readings with vocabulary.  Before each of these, the author tells you what sections of the grammar and syntax sections you need to learn before going through the reading.  For example, for the very first reading, you are instructed to learn the present indicative of the verb &quot;to be&quot;; the personal pronouns; and the weak declension of masculine and feminine nouns.  So what you do is dip back, again and again, into the grammar and syntax, gradually learning more and more.  At the same time, you're learning vocabulary through the readings.<br />This &quot;learning&quot; section is followed by about 50 pages of readings, and there is a complete glossary at the back.<br />Bottom line, it's a big book (about 500 pages), and if you work through it conscientiously, you'll have an excellent READING knowledge of Icelandic.  For spoken Icelandic, you'll have to look elsewhere.	2001-01-27

The typeset is not the easiest to read, especially the bold print.  And the grammar is introduced at a demanding pace.  (Which is OK; nobody said that learning had to be easy.  You're definitely allowed to take your time, and absorb the material.)<br />The presentation of grammar follows a fairly traditional path.  Each lesson introduces a large number of grammatical points, but there are plenty of examples given.  Early lessons have vocabulary lists; the vocabulary for readings in later lessions must be looked up in the glossary in the back.  Most critically, the answers to the exercises and translations of the readings are given in the back of the book.<br />Unless you have a high level of linguistic sophistication, my recommendation would be to start your study of Latin with something a little gentler (like Wheelock).  But this is a great resource, and should not be missed.  My suggestion would be to work through Wheelock's &quot;Latin&quot; (or at least halfway through), and then tackle this book.  It will be a good review of the grammar you know already, you'll learn a LOT more about Latin grammar and syntax, and you'll get a great deal of practice reading some pretty tough Latin (with the translations available to check your understanding).<br />In summary, you might not want to START with this book, but you will definitely benefit from working through it somewhere along your path.	2001-01-13

If you're hoping for a basic grammar, with graded lessons, you're going to be disappointed.  This is an excellent work, an indispensable work, but it's a reader for those who have already learned the basics of Old Icelandic.<br />After a brief introduction to Scandinavian history, the Viking expansion, and saga literature, the author gives about 160 pages of West Norse, normalized into classical Icelandic.  Most of the selections are from the sagas, and they are well annotated, and a full vocabulary is included in the back of the book.  There is also a section on what he calls &quot;East Norse&quot; (the Old Norse particular to Denmark, Norway and Sweden), and a small section dealing with the language of the runic inscriptions.<br />There is a 40 or 50 page section where he presents the grammar, but it's more along the lines of an outline of the grammar.  It's sufficient for someone who already has a good knowledge of Old English, OHG, or Gothic, but my hat's off to anyone with the determination to acquire a reading knowledge of the language from this grammatical sketch alone.<br />There's the rub: where DO you get the introduction to Old Icelandic that will enable you to use this book with benefit?  The superb learning grammar &quot;Old Icelandic: an Introductory Course&quot; by Valfells and Cathey is out of print.  Kenneth Chapman wrote &quot;Graded Readings and Exercises in Old Icelandic&quot; about 35 years ago, but that's disappeared as well.  Until either of those works is reprinted, or a new introduction is written, it's going to be tough.<br />But none of this is meant to take anything away from Gordon's work; it's a wonderful, scholarly work.  Problem is, you really do need to have something of a background before you use it.	2000-12-25

This work is an excellent companion and supplement to his grammar.<br />This selection of readings is keyed to his grammar; each Latin selection follows a certain lesson in his &quot;Introductory Course&quot;.  Each short Latin reading is on the left (even) pages, and the vocabulary and grammatical annotations for the selection are on the facing (right) page.  All are heavily adapted and annotated, but less so as the grammatical sophistication of the student grows.<br />I found this work beneficial in several ways:  it provides supplementary reading and practice to reinforce the grammar; it gives additional vocabulary, above and beyond what's given in the grammar; and it gives a good mix of cultural, literary, and mythological themes to instruct and interest the student.<br />An excellent learning aid, at a very reasonable price.  What more could you ask for?	2000-12-12

First off, don't think that this 2-volume set will teach you to read Chinese by itself; it's designed as a companion to his &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;.  Each of the 48 lessons is matched to a lesson in his &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;; for example, before you study Lesson 10 in Beginning Chinese Reader, you need to have learned the grammar in Lesson 8 of &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;.<br />The author stresses a couple of key points:  Learning characters has to come AFTER the sound system and after at least some grammar has been introduced.  And secondly, the number of characters you know is not nearly as important as the number of character combinations that you've learned, and the amount of practice that you've had with the characters.<br />Each lesson introduces 10 new characters, and 20 to 40 character combinations built up from the new characters and characters previously learned.  All the new characters are used in &quot;Illustrative Sentences&quot;, which are translated into English at the end of the chapter. The bulk of each lesson consists of readings, both in dialogue form and expository prose.<br />By the end of the 2 books, you will have learned app. 400 characters, and about 1,200 character compounds.  But these are the most frequently utilized 400 characters; according to a study cited, these 400 characters account for 73% of all the characters found in books, periodicals, and other sources.<br />The book uses traditional characters, although in the back of volume 2, the authors gives the simplified versions, and a small bit of practice using these.  Like the companion &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;, the topics are somewhat dated ... you constantly read about so-and-so not having enough money to send his children to college.  But overall, if you're seriously interested in the Chinese language, and you're willing to invest the time and energy to do it right, the DeFrancis series is the surest way to get a sound foundation in Chinese.	2000-12-11

If you're interested in the Icelandic language, whether modern or Old Icelandic, you're probably frustrated by the lack of learning aids / grammars.  I stumbled on this book about 15 years ago in Schoenhof's Foreign Language Bookstore in Boston, and I've treasured it ever since.<br />It consists of 35 lessons, and each lesson introduces a couple of grammatical points, with plenty of examples.  The grammar section in each lesson is followed by one or two reading selections, vocabulary and exercises.  The exercises consist of grammatical drills, and sentences to be translated from English into Old Icelandic.  (Why translate into a language that's not spoken any more?  As the authors say in their preface, &quot;Even a passive linguistic ability must have its active intellectual input.&quot;  I love that sentence!)  Best of all, the answers to the grammatical exercises and translation sentences are included in the back of the book.<br />The authors realize that students of Old Icelandic generally fall into two camps - those in it for the literary value of the sagas, and those more interested in comparative Germanic linguistics.  And they've designed the book to benefit both.<br />Be warned...Old Icelandic is a difficult, highly inflected language.  Be prepared for a hard road; there are a lot of grammatical rules, a lot of noun classes, a lot of verbal intricacies, with a dizzying array of phonological laws underlying all of this.  But if you've got at least a little bit of linguistic sophistication (and a lot of patience!), this is the best thing going.<br />The first 10 lessons have &quot;made-up&quot; reading selections, but after that, it's all the real thing.  Each lesson introduces a large number of vocabulary items; by the end of the book you're going to have the grammatical knowledge and the vocabulary to read just about anything on your own (with the help of a dictionary, of course).<br />Bottom line, it's a tough language; but if you've got the desire and thestamina, this book will give you a very, very good knowledge of the Old Icelandic language.	2000-11-30

(To get full benefit, you really need to buy the companion &quot;Key to a Grammar of Akkadian&quot;, by the same author.)  The grammar is divided into graded lessions, and each lesson introduces 2 or 3 grammatical points.  These are followed by vocabulary and exercises to test your command of the grammar just learned.  Translation exercises from Akkadian to English, and English to Akkadian follow.  The format is very similar to that used by Lambdin in his excellent grammars of Biblical Hebrew, Coptic, and Ge'ez.  Again, the &quot;Key to the Grammar&quot; is indispensable; by checking your answers against the key, you'll know if you've mastered the grammar.  No previous knowledge of linguistics or any other Semitic language is assumed.<br />After about 10 lessons, he introduces cuneiform signs, and thereafter, each lesson has a number of short readings provided in cuneiform.  It's a little daunting at first...in my earlier stabs at Akkadian, I had only seen the (simpler) Neo-Assyrian versions of the signs.  The author gives 3 varieties of each sign: the Old Babylonian lapidary form, the OB cursive form, and the Neo-Assyrian form. <br />Learning Akkadian is no easy task.  This is a big book, and it's probably going to take me over a year to get through it.  But the material is presented in a very accessible and straightforward manner, and each lesson builds on the material learned before.  If you enjoy the intellectual challenge of learning a dead language, you'll love this book.	2000-11-17

It seems to be aimed at high school students, as an adjunct to their study of Latin.  Older readers will enjoy it as well.  Before digging into something heavier, like Grant's history, or Dudley, or a college-level text such as Sinnigen &amp; Boak, it's good to get an overview and a idea of the main themes; if you start out with those heavier volumes, it's easy to lose sight of the main currents, and get caught up in the details and minutiae.<br />It follows a fairly traditional path, and concentrates on political and military history.  In style, this book reminded me of the two histories of Rome that Isaac Asimov wrote.  It does not assume any previous knowledge of Rome, and the author includes many edifying and entertaining episodes from Livy, stories that are part and parcel of our Western heritage.<br />Note:  this work is heavily weighted toward early Rome and the Republic.  The author doesn't get to the Principate until page 227 out of 284.  (An aside: the book has a total of 300 pages, not the 320 mentioned above.)  For full information about the Empire, you'll want to supplement this book with something else.<br />The book could have done with some more pictures and maps, but all in all, a good value for the price, and a wonderful way to start learning about our Latin heritage.	2000-11-12

It consists of an introduction to the sounds and script, and is followed by 40 lessons.<br />The format is very similar to the textbooks of Lambdin and Huehnergard: each lesson introduces several grammatical points, and these are followed by vocabulary, readings, and exercises.  Arabic script is used throughout, but the vocabulary and grammatical explanations are transliterated into Roman letters, as well.<br />2 points to mention ... I found the section on the Arabic script to be short of practice material.  I'd recommend &quot;Alif Baa&quot;, published by Georgetown University Press, as an excellent introduction to Arabic sounds and script.  Be sure to get the 4 tapes that accompany the workbook.  This will allow you to concentrate on the grammar; otherwise, the lessons can be a tedious exercise in decoding until the script becomes more familiar.  Second point:  I'd get the &quot;Key to the Exercises&quot;; it contains the answers to both the English-to-Arabic, and Arabic-to-English exercises given in the main text. <br />All in all, a very user-friendly introduction to a fascinating language and culture.	2000-10-19

(Try Greenspahn's &quot;An Introduction to Aramaic&quot;)<br />A better title for this book would have been &quot;An introduction to Syriac Scripts&quot;.  And it does it well.  The bulk of the book concerns itself with the Eastern Syriac (Nestorian) script.  For each letter, the stroke order is shown, and room is alloted for practice.  After the alphabet has been introduced, the Estrangela letters that differ from the Nestorian are given. (The Serta script is not given).  There is a small section on vocalization, and rules for spirantization.  There is little or no grammar given.<br />All in all, a good introduction to the script.  Valuable as a &quot;pre-primer&quot; to more advanced Syriac grammars such as Thackston or Muraoka.	2000-10-19

The lessons are short - about 5 or 6 vocabulary items are introduced, along with a grammatical point or two.  There are not a lot of examples given for each grammatical point, but this is made up for with the exercises.  Each lesson, in addition to the reading selection, has translation exercises, both English to Greek, and Greek to English.  Volume 2 has another 100 lessons or so, mostly annotated readings.  Volume 3 is the &quot;Teacher's Manual and Key&quot;.  It contains translations of all the reading selections, and the answers to all the translation exercises.  There are also tests for each lesson, with the answers provided.  The presence of the answer key (translations and the answers to the exercises) is what makes this series excellent for those learning on their own; students get both practice in the application of the grammar, and feedback on how well they have learned the material.<br />A background in Latin is obviously helpful, but not required.  The cultural notes, quotes, and historical information help keep interest high.  Obviously a text meant for use in Catholic / Jesuit schools, it's a refreshing throwback to the days when the classics were respected, and &quot;dead white men&quot; were not politically incorrect.<br />Homeric Greek is not an easy language.  But if you're motivated, willing to keep on pluggin', do the exercises faithfully, you'll end up with an excellent knowledge of this difficult but beautiful language.	2000-10-19

Younger folks may well need to start with something a little simpler, like  D'Aulaire or &quot;Gods &amp; Heroes from Viking Mythology&quot; published  by Schocken Books, but for adult readers looking for an intelligent  introduction to Norse mythology, this book can't be beat.	2000-09-03

Granted, Icelandic is nowhere close to being a major  world language, but if they can publish modern, pedagogically sound books  and tapes for Slovene, Xhosa, and Zulu, why can't they do it for  Icelandic?<br />If you want to memorize lists of prepositions, outdated slang,  and scads of minor noun declensions, by all means, buy this book.  If  you're industrious, you might develop a decent reading knowledge of the  language.  But that's about it.  I'll wait for something a little more  modern to come along.	2000-08-27

My hat's off to anyone who could pick up more  than a smattering of Hittite from this book alone.<br />I had hoped for a  series of lessons, with vocabulary and exercises.  After an introduction to  the writing system, the authors launch into a catalogue of declensions  (&quot;nominal system&quot;, &quot;the pronominal system&quot;, &quot;the  verbal system&quot;, etc.)  It looks like a throwback to the phonology -  morphology - syntax grammars of the last century.<br />The only thing that  makes this work something more than a dry reference grammar for those who  already know some Sumerian and Akkadian is a 40-page or so section of  readings in the rear of the book.  There are 4 reading selections given in  cuneiform, with the transliteration and a literal translation into English  underneath.  Each selection is then followed by a &quot;real&quot; English  translation.<br />For a true learner's grammar of Hittite, I guess we'll just  have to wait.  In the last couple of years, we've seen excellent learning  aids for ancient languages (Huehnergard's Akkadian, Hayes' Sumerian,  Allen's Middle Egyptian, to name a few.)<br />I'd recommend you wait a little  longer for something meant for true beginners.  Hopefully, it won't take  too long.	2000-08-20

The vast majority of Chinese characters are  NOT the charming &quot;sun plus moon equals bright&quot; type of  pictographs.  They are a two-part composite, with one character (the  radical) carrying the general semantic meaning of the compound, and the  other character giving an indication of the sound of the compound.  (for an  excellent discussion of this, see John DeFrancis' The Chinese Language -  Fact and Fantasy.)  What Wieger presents is a scheme of 858 phonetic  series, and by learning the sound(s) associated with these series you get,  in essence, multiple characters for the price of one. <br />So forget about  his outdated etymologies, and use his information only when it's vivid and  makes the character easy to remember. Otherwise, make up your own  mnemonics.  But the sound-carrying parts of characters - his &quot;phonetic  series&quot; - repeat themselves over and over again in different compound  characters.  And being familiar with the more prolific phonetic series will  make the memorization of new characters much easier.	2000-08-14

Note: this review is for the updated, revised edition (Undena, 2000).   Admission #1 - I'm not an Assyriologist, nor an academic, so I have no  professional qualifications to judge this work.  But I enjoy learning  languages, and I know what works for me.  Admission #2 - I've just begun  studying it, and I'm only on lesson 2.<br />If I could have designed the ideal  learning grammar for a &quot;dead&quot; language, it would look something  like this.  There are 26 lessons - each one starts with a vocabulary of 10  to 15 words, given in cuneiform and transliteration.  These are followed by  a short reading (mostly royal inscriptions from the Ur III period).  All  reading selections are given in cuneiform, transliteration, transcription,  and English translation.  No guessing about whether you've understood the  text, or not!  The grammatical explanations are complete and clear; no  special linguistic knowledge is presupposed.  When there is scholarly  disagreement about grammar or syntax, this is noted as well.  The grammar  is presented inductively; a reading is presented, and the grammar necessary  to understand it is explained. Each lesson builds on the previous ones, and  there is a wealth of cultural and historical information provided.<br />In  summary, whether you're learning with a teacher or on your own, it's hard  to imagine a text better than this one.	2000-08-07

But I enjoy learning languages, and I know what works for me.<br />This is the best learning textbook for Chinese that I've come across.   Granted, it's somewhat dated, but the presentation of the grammar is  clear, and the drills are first-rate.  (important note: buy the tapes that  accompany the book; try the language lab at Cornell, or Far Eastern  Publications, in Yale.  The language lab at Seton Hall University used to  sell them as well).<br />There are 24 lessons, and the common theme throughout  is the experiences of an American student in Taiwan.  Each lesson begins  with a dialogue, and is followed by new vocabulary and what DeFrancis calls  &quot;sentence build-up&quot;; the new vocabulary is introduced first in  small phrases, then in full sentences.  Each lesson introduces 4 or 5  grammatical patterns, with illustrative sentences.  The lessons also have  pronunciation practice, addditional drills, dialogues, puzzles, etc.   Again, the tapes are excellent, and indispensable.<br />The book is geared  toward spoken Mandarin; all the Chinese is in pinyin romanization. If  you're interested in the written language as well, there's his 2-part  Beginning Chinese Reader that excellent, as well.<br />If you're serious about  learning Chinese, want to know more than a few phrases, and you're willing  to invest the time and energy to learn it well, it would be hard to find  anything better than this.	2000-07-27

This is the best introduction to the field of mythology that I've come across.<br />Ms. Lowry starts off by defining what myths are, and what they do. She discusses how they provide personal guidance, support (or  challenge) the social order, how they provide us with a sense of physical  order, and how they help us face life's mysteries.  She differentiates  myth, legend, and folktale, and outlines the &quot;diffusion vs.  archetype&quot; argument.   The following sections cover the heroic  pattern, the tension between chaos and an ordered cosmos, and the mystery  of death.  This is not merely an anthology of snippets from around the  world; she discusses in-depth the underlying motifs, and the disguises they  take on as they appear in different ages and cultures.  The breadth of her  scholarship is impressive...she's equally comfortable with Theseus and  Gilgamesh, Horus and Beowulf.  More than just a dry anthology, this book  challenged me, taught me a great deal, and made me want to learn more.  And  you can't ask for much more than that.	2000-07-27

(For that, use Huehnergard's &quot;Grammar of Akkadian&quot;, and be sure to get the companion &quot;Key to a Grammar of Akkadian&quot;). But if you have  already started learning Akkadian, whether with Huehnergard, Riemschneider,  Caplice, or Marcus, this book will help you immensely.  Part I is a summary  of paradigms, concentrating obviously on verbal forms.  Part II is  &quot;Helps&quot;; alphabetical order, alternate terminology for verbs,  numbers, common abbreviations, etc.  Part III is a 30-page or so  compilation of proper names you'll come across.  The heart of Part IV is a  listing of the most common cuneiform signs (Neo-Assyrian variant).  It is  based on the sign lists of Labat and Borger.  There are several indices to  look up a sign, given its syllabic or logographic value.

It contains app. 80 selections of medieval Latin,  varying in length from a short paragraph to about a full page.  The  selections come from a wide range of subjects (all British-related):  charters, court rolls, history, grants, deeds, etc. Each selection is put  in its historical context, and linguistic explanations / glosses are  included after each reading.  The main benefit for me was the inclusion, in  the back of the book, of translations of all the selections.  For someone  trying to learn on their own, this is indispensible.

The author includes hundreds of Latin mottoes, sayings, bon mots, and proverbs.  They are ordered alphabetically, each followed by its pronunciation (in an informal but generally useful  transcription), and general sense.  Most of the entries have an explanatory  sentence or two, giving the background, source, and literal translation.  A  fun and educational book; helpful to the student of Latin, and entertaining  and educational to the general reader.  Well worth the money!	2000-05-12

After having tried to learn Syriac (without too much success) from a number of texts (Healey, Ungnad, Muraoka, Robinson), this grammar was like a breath of fresh air! For me, the Syriac script was the major sticking point. Professor Thackston gets the student past this obstacle by using unpointed Estrangela, and by giving transliterations of all paradigms, examples, and vocabulary. In a clear introduction to the sounds and script, he covers the complexities of syllabic division, accentuation, and spirantization in a succinct and understandable manner. There are twenty lessons, and the methodology is similar to that of Lambdin (Biblical Hebrew, Coptic) and Huehnergard (Akkadian): several grammatical points explained clearly, with examples; vocabulary (in Estrangela and in transliteration); and sample sentences / reading exercises. Although I'm only on Lesson 3, I find this book stimulating and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm certain that after completing this text, the conscientious student should have no trouble tackling the New Testament with the aid of a dictionary, or going back to the other works (cited at the beginning of this review) to get extra practice in grammar and reading. The only thing that I feel would have improved this text is a key to the exercises. What I'm doing is to translate the Syriac sentences into English, and after a day or two, translate them back into Syriac, and compare them with the original. This, along with a careful reading of the grammatical principles, gives good feedback. Professor Thackston saw fit to publish a key to his &quot;Introduction to Koranic and Classical Arabic&quot;; hopefully we'll see a key to this work some day as well. But all in all, a pleasure and a wonderful resource.	2000-01-09
