Really, you don't even have to pay taxes; you choose to because not paying them would lead to problems.<br /><br />Barry Schwartz, in this little gem of a book, reminds us that life can be defined as a series of choices. You choose to get up in the morning. You choose to shower, get dressed and go to work. You choose where (or whether) to go to college, what car to buy, what job offer to accept, what flavor of ice cream to eat.<br /><br />Twenty-first-century Americans have a wider array of choices to make than any other society in history. More schools, more cars, more occupations, more styles of blue jeans. That should be a good thing, right? Well, yes... and no. Schwartz shows us how an overabundance of choices can lead to us to squander our time and our emotional energy, endlessly agonizing over every single choice, breathlessly analyzing every possible option, angle and outcome. As if that weren't enough, Schwartz explains, the more options there are, the more likely we are to regret the one we chose, no matter how well it might suit our needs.<br /><br />The \\"simple life\\" of our ancestors was one of limited choices. People tended to spend their lives in the city where they grew up, stay married to one person, and keep the same job until they retired. As limiting as that sounds, research shows that people were happier 40 years ago than we are now.<br /><br />So will it take a return to the 1960s to make us all happy? Certainly not. Abundant options are a good thing, as long as we approach them rationally. For every decision we face, there's another decision we have to make first: whether to maximize or satisfice. To maximize is to meticulously analyze and compare every possible option. To satisfice is to limit the number of options considered and to accept the first one that will satisfy us. Whereas you should be a maximizer in choosing a mate, you can probably afford to be a satisficer when you pick which car to buy. Even if you find later on that the car you bought is inferior to one of the others you considered, you must weigh that disappointment against the emotional cost of agonizing over a decision whose implications are relatively temporary.<br /><br />The Paradox of Choice is the best kind of self-help book. It's unemotional and never preachy. It makes its case  with hard scientific data, never talking down to the reader. And, in the last quarter of the book, it suggests practical solutions for simplifying life.which car to buy.

I have old, yellowing editions of all the previous installments, which Ms. Gellis wrote in the 1980s, and they will remain on my shelf 'til the day I die. But as I read _Desiree_, I was repeatedly dismayed at almost every aspect. I only finished it out of a sense of loyalty to an author I admire to the point of reverence. Had this book been written by anyone other than Gellis, I'd have put it down before the halfway point.<br /><br />The main characters are colorless and sometimes not even likeable. Desiree, especially, is weak and vacillating and has no self-control whatsoever. The hero, Alex, is a nice guy but so full of self-doubt that I questioned my beloved Simon's judgment in appointing him as a castellan. And Alex, like Desiree, turns out to be lacking in the self-control department. The villain, Vachel, bungles all his half-baked schemes, and the one character who might have made a worthy opponent for the hero and heroine remains offstage throughout the story.<br /><br />The premise is a good one: Desiree married an old man for protection against a neighboring lord who tried to force her to marry him. Now her kindly old husband is debilitated by illness, and Alex comes to serve as castellan so there will be a strong male presence on her lands. While Alex works to protect Desiree's domains from incursion by her old enemy, they fall in love. This could have been a heart-wrenching scenario: a young lady in a platonic marriage to a kind old man nobly fighting her attraction to a young, virile knight who likewise would cut off his arm before he would wrong his helpless old employer. But alas, this is where Alex and Desiree's lack of self-control made me cringe.<br /><br />Even the writing disappointed me. It's as if some wannabe writer set out to imitate Gellis's style. There's a familiar echo now and then, but precious little of the vibrancy and richness that makes the previous Roselynde installments pure joy to read.<br /><br />_Desiree_ is not without redeeming qualities. Gellis's loving attention to historical detail is there (albeit in a lesser quantity than before). The fleeting glimpses we get of our beloved Simon and Alinor are the highlights of the story. They are just as we would imagine them during the early years of their marriage: happy, openly affectionate and ruling their lands jointly. Alinor is her usual pragmatic, forthright self and has bought the office of sheriff of Sussex for Simon.<br /><br />If this is your first Roberta Gellis book, please don't judge her by it. I feel certain the inferiority of _Desiree_ is due to the dictates of her publisher and not to any diminution of her abilities or standards. This isn't the 1980s, and she simply wrote _Desiree_ in the way historical romances are written today.<br /><br />The good news is that Harlequin is going to re-release the entire Roselynde Chronicles over the next year or two, so there will soon be crisp, shiny new editions of Gellis at her best. I just might replace my old, crumbling copies. Meanwhile, if you like medieval mysteries, Gellis's Magdalene la Batarde books are among the best and prove that her abilities are still completely intact.s the previous Roselynde installments pure joy to read.    _Desiree_ is not without redeeming qualities.

While that's an understandable economic decision, it's a shame from a literary standpoint. Now, I didn't read The Code, so I have no business telling you it's bad. I didn't read The Code because the amateurish writing style put me off before I got to the end of page one. But I can tell you I devoured every elegant word of the 656-page _Historian_.<br /><br />It's the early 1970s, and our unnamed 16-year-old American heroine lives a lonely yet still rather enviable existence with her father and a housekeeper in Amsterdam. They vacation in history-laden European destinations most of us have only seen in pictures. She reads the dusty old volumes in her father's library. One day, she uncovers a beautiful leather-bound volume with all its pages blank except for one sinister woodcut of a dragon in the center. Along with the book are letters and research by the scholar who was her father's graduate advisor. When she asks her father what these items are, she gets a tale - gradually revealed at great personal cost to him - that sends both of them on a quest for the world's oldest living - or rather, undead - person: Vlad Dracula.<br /><br />The reader is shuttled backward and forward through time between the 1950s and the 1970s. We meet the heroine's parents at the time when they're drawn together by a common goal: saving someone who's important to them both, someone they're convinced has been abducted by Dracula. This search takes them to Turkey, to Hungary, and then on to Romania and back to Turkey again.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in the present-day 1970s, the heroine gradually unravels her family's sad and shocking past, which is inextricably linked with Dracula himself. She soon realizes she has no choice but embark on a journey of her own - one that will bring her either profound joy or profound sadness. But the one thing that's never in doubt is that it's the adventure of her life.<br /><br />The hunt for Dracula takes the characters to places that are unorthodox by vampire novel standards yet perhaps more appropriate: churches, libraries, universities and monasteries. There's only one relatively brief but thoroughly memorable nighttime visit to a castle ruin. But if you're thinking there can't be much suspense or many thrills in watching graduate students poke around in old books, letters and manuscripts, think again. The Historian is that great rarity among literary novels: a page-turner. Not only is it more beautifully written than anything to come out of New York in a long while, but it's also full of edge-of-the-seat thrills, some of them deceptively subtle, and it's an emotional roller coaster ride. There's very little bloodletting, but Ms. Kostova wrings every drop of impact from those infrequent spillages. These characters aren't hunting Dracula simply because they hate him or they want to prove how smart and brave they are. They're hunting him because they can't do anything else. There is no better motivation, nor one that's easier for a reader to identify with.<br /><br />In my opinion, The Historian is the best novel of 2005, and I believe - pardon the pun - that history will treat it well.cula takes the characters to places that are unorthodox by vampire novel standards yet perhaps more appropriate: churches, libraries, universities and monasteries.

US	51703175	R2ZCATX51ISIXE	0520036433	943405756	King John (English Monarchs)	Books	5	33	35	N	Y	Truth is more fascinating than fiction	W.L. Warren begins this biography with an explanation of how and why King John ended up with the dastardly reputation we all know from Robin Hood stories and other popular fiction. John, Warren says, suffered from a confluence of factors that have rendered a slanted and warped portrait of him. Historiography methods of the past concentrated almost entirely on contemporary chronicles, practically ignoring administrative records and other types of extraneous material. John especially suffers under this kind of examination, since the chroniclers who wrote about his reign were all either poorly informed, outrageously prejudiced, or both.<br /><br />John is mocked with the name \\"Softsword\\" for having lost his hold on the French domains his father, Henry II, and his brother, Richard I, worked so hard to keep. Warren points out, however, that such far-flung territories could never have been maintained, and, even had Richard lived, the French outcome would probably have been the same. Far from being a military do-nothing, John is the founder of the Royal Navy. Warren marvels that a nation that came to treasure its naval superiority as England did could so completely vilify the founder of its navy.<br /><br />But this book is no whitewash, either. John was duplicitous and grasping and didn't trust anyone who wasn't beholden to him. He surrounded himself with baseborn hangers-on, excluding and alienating the barons of his realm. He took money for dispensing justice and then still ruled against the side that paid him. He was cunning and conniving, and was known to issue decrees that said one thing while secretly issuing instructions that ran exactly counter to what he wrote.<br /><br />Yet this same king instituted something that, to historians, is even more important than the Royal Navy: the systematic keeping of government and court records. Before John ascended the throne in 1199, English government recordkeeping is spotty and haphazard - a frustratingly obscure and incomplete source for the study of history. But from 1199 on, these same records emerge as a rich and authoritative resource. Hmm, almost as if John knew the chroniclers weren't going to treat him fairly...<br /><br />Another myth that gets busted in this book is the one about King John's being forced to sign the Magna Carta. While Warren concedes that John had backed himself into a corner by running roughshod over his barons, he explains that the Magna Carta was simply a compromise brokered between him and his opponents. Nobody was holding a gun to his head - and wouldn't have been even had guns been invented. And John had the last laugh when, days later, he made England a fief of the Pope, who reciprocated by declaring the Magna Carta null and void.<br /><br />When I started reading this book, I had a fairly negative attitude about King John. By the time I finished, I still didn't like him much, but I had a new appreciation for him as a brilliant, complex, and probably tortured soul who tried to do great things and occasionally succeeded.of history.

Naturally, the Histoire's version on Marshal's life, the glowing but vague physical descriptions, the legendary exploits and such, is to be taken with a grain of salt. However, Painter's book is much more than a mere translation of the _Histoire_. While Marshal's early life is to some extent lost in the mists of time, significant objective information becomes available beginning with his association with the Plantagenets when he was in his early 20s. From this point on, this well-footnoted book references a variety of chronicles and administrative records, and references to the _Histoire_ grow fewer and farther between.<br /><br />Two aspects of Marshal's life make his life story especially edifying to the medievalist:<br /><br />First, it shows us what virtually every younger son who didn't go into holy orders wanted to be. Marshal epitomized the late twelfth-century knight, first distinguishing himself in battle and on the tournament field, then garnering the attention of a powerful patron, Eleanor of Aquitaine, which he then parlayed into a long and profitable royal association that included marriage to the wealthiest heiress in the realm. Late in life, he became the reluctant but highly effective regent of England. Even if the _Histoire_ sometimes is a bit too glowing in its praise, somewhat over the top in detailing his exploits, \\"reading between the lines\\" renders an only slightly duller portrait.<br /><br />Second, his long life and intimate association with English royalty means that his story is also a crash course in early Plantagenet history, beginning with latter part of Henry II's reign and then encompassing Richard I, John, and the first few years of the boy king Henry III. While Painter probably isn't entirely fair to John, with whom William fell out a couple of times, William's experiences with John are well-documented and can still be instructive.<br /><br />I found Painter's writing surprisingly readable, at least as much, and probably more so, than Georges Duby's. Painter was only slightly less enthusiastic about Marshal than the writer of the _Histoire_, never applying anything but the highest of motives to Marshal's actions. But he does a good job of justifying his positions; I always felt they were grounded in realism.n and then encompassing Richard I, John, and the first few years of the boy king Henry III.

This very special occasion merits red wax candles, a rare luxury for members of the petty baronage of France in the late twelfth century. Thus, as the callow groom and his frightened bride spend their first few married nights in private room with a bed all to themselves - a first for both of them - a new dynasty begins.<br /><br />When she fails to become pregnant immediately, Ansiau's father berates his little daughter-in-law. Finally, however, she does give him the grandson he craves; indeed Alis spends most of the next 30 years pregnant.<br /><br />She does enjoy some respite from continuous maternity: Ansiau joins two Crusades to the Holy Land. Here, Oldenbourg takes the one historical liberty I noticed in this very large book. While the Third Crusade is accurately placed at 1188-92, she has moved the Second Crusade forward by 40 years or so, to about 1179. This is especially interesting, considering that Oldenbourg is perhaps better known for her highly respected nonfiction works on the Crusades. As you read, the reason for her taking this liberty becomes obvious: The \\"Second\\" Crusade happens almost entirely offstage, the narrative staying with Alis and her travails during her husband's absence - dealing with household and harvests, managing the endless renegotiation of their mortgages with the Jewish moneylender, coming into her own as a woman and as lady of the castle. For a time, Ansiau is thought dead, and, thinking herself a widow, Alis falls in love with and nearly remarries a handsome young knight named Erard.<br /><br />The Third Crusade is Ansiau's story entirely, and there probably is no better fictional treatment of that war anywhere. Oldenbourg even goes so far as to quote passages directly from contemporary chronicles. The Crusades were politically as well as religiously charged, and Oldenbourg succeeds in making the machinations and counter-machinations of the western Christians, the eastern Christians, and the Muslims *almost* accessible (no mean feat). We also see inside the hearts of the Crusaders, understand what drove them, experience firsthand how they were affected by the holy wars they fought. Shortly after his second return from the Holy Land, Ansiau indulges in a love affair of his own - one so scandalous that it makes Alis's dalliance with Erard seem almost innocent by comparison.<br /><br />This novel depicts much that the modern reader who is unschooled in medieval European culture will find unfathomable, probably even objectionable: Different standards of hygiene; questionable sexual ethics and contradictory attitudes toward women; Christian kings whose conduct in war doesn't exactly adhere to the Geneva Convention; a Christianity that sometimes seems more superstition than religion. But we see these things in their proper context. They are rendered, although not always agreeable, at least comprehensible.<br /><br />Oldenbourg's style is a delight. She writes in a way that publishers don't allow anymore because of the volume of paper it requires. (This edition is printed in a tiny font to make up the difference.) The story could probably have been told in about one third fewer words, but that would have forced the sacrifice of Oldenbourg's rich prose style, her fascinating character sketches, and the uniquely clear lens through which she examines a profoundly complex time period.<br /><br />First in a trilogy that continues with THE CORNERSTONE and then DESTINY OF FIRE, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is a saga; there is no one tangible plot that begins on page one and resolves on page 491. This is, to put it simply, the story of Ansiau and Alis and their family; it's worth telling because of the tumultuous time in which they lived, and because their society held the earliest glimmers of the one we know today. For those of us with western European roots, the day-to-day struggles depicted through nearly 40 years of Ansiau and Alis's marriage grant a rare look backward at how our forebears lived, and how we began to be what we are today.day-to-day struggles depicted through nearly 40 years of Ansiau and Alis's marriage grant a rare look backward at how our forebears lived, and how we began to be what we are today.	2005-04-20

His arrival in London coincides with the climax of one of England's greatest and most complex power struggles ever. What's more, his sense of honor demands that he become involved.<br /><br />It's 1553, and, with England's teenaged King Edward VI near death, Northumberland is the country's de facto ruler. Next in line for the throne are Edward's sisters, first Mary and then Elizabeth. But Northumberland doesn't intend to relinquish his power; he determines to keep control of the throne for himself, and no expediency is beneath him.<br /><br />Brendan's first assignment is to deliver a clandestine message from Robert to the princess Elizabeth. When he meets the magnetic and mysterious princess and senses the danger she faces, his expectations of dull servitude and possible advancement in the Dudley household end. Brendan offers his services to Her Grace, and soon finds himself tangled in a treacherous web of plots and counter-plots. Stunningly, it becomes evident that buried within these machinations is the secret to his own parentage.<br /><br />Although mystery and intrigue take center stage, the human element is strong in this book. Brendan's drive to learn who he really is - and to understand the role he has unknowingly played in the Dudleys' plotting - is central to the story, and adds a depth and urgency that kept me turning pages well into the night. He arrives in London with little more to recommend him than a strong intellect and a keenly observant nature. But this courageous young man rises admirably to his new challenges, growing immensely in acumen and confidence in the short period of time covered by the story. Along the way, he finds much-deserved love with a beautiful woman.<br /><br />C.W. Gortner's debut novel is vibrant with historical flavor and wicked with intrigue. His lustrous prose resounds with depth and subtlety, and his speculations on one of history's most fascinating episodes are utterly engrossing and entirely too plausible.us prose resounds with depth and subtlety, and his speculations on one of history's most fascinating episodes are utterly engrossing and entirely too plausible.	2005-03-06

But wait.  Eleanor of Aquitaine was a real person, so how can a novelization of her life be fantasy?<br /><br />Therein lies the problem.  This story *could* have worked as a fantasy, but only if the names of the places and people had all been changed and it contained at least one fantasy element, like, say, the two moons in Guy Gavriel Kay's _Lions of al-Rassan_.  As it stands, Ms. Kaufman, scarcely batting an eye, delivers us an Eleanor who couldn't possibly have existed.  At least not for very long.<br /><br />_The Book of Eleanor_ begins promisingly enough, at the beginning of the 50-something Eleanor's imprisonment by her husband, Henry II.  By this time, the two hate one another, and Eleanor, thinking that she is to be starved and/or frozen to death, begins setting her life down on paper.  (I'm surprised the real Eleanor didn't actually do that.)  Thus we're shown the fifteen-year-old Eleanor, much-coveted as a wife more for being heiress to a vast duchy than for her legendary beauty.  She's forced into an odious marriage with religious fanatic Louis of France.  Here's where the story begins to unravel.<br /><br />There isn't any way Louis of France could have held his throne as long as he did and then died of natural causes if he'd been as effete and ineffectual as he's portrayed here.  In the Middle Ages, all sorts of nasty things happened to people who tried to be king and weren't up to the task.  As the narrative wears on, you notice that every man, with the exception of Abbot Suger and Eleanor's quasi-fictional lover, Rancon, is portrayed as reprehensible.  You sense a pattern:  Eleanor, for all her intellect, beauty and courage, was a mere Victim of Men, nearly all of whom were Evil.  And, as a weak woman, she found jealousy -- of a husband Kaufman would have us believe she hadn't wanted to begin with -- her chief motivator.<br /><br />Despite its tenuous grip on historical reality, this book did hold my interest -- in part because it is a compelling story in its own right, and in part because I found it sort of fun to analyze.  Does Ms. Kaufman have a political motive for her slash-and-burn wielding of dramatic license?  Did she give Eleanor a fictional lover because she felt the real story needed \\"sexing up\\" to satisfy the average reader?  Why did she not stick closer to the real story, which most of us find fascinating, and which still contains enough unknowns to allow for considerable novelistic speculation?  And what would have happened to the real Eleanor if Henry had ever suspected her of even a single incident of infidelity, let alone of depositing at least two cuckoos into his nest?enuous grip on historical reality, this book did hold my interest -- in part because it is a compelling story in its own right, and in part because I found it sort of fun to analyze.

To hype it as anything else is misleading, and to criticize it for not being something more is disingenuous.  I'd be willing to bet Professor Davis simply decided to turn himself a handy profit by turning one of the beginning writer courses he teaches at the University of Oklahoma into a book.  Nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />Here's what works:  Prof. Davis puts those \\"purists\\" who scoff at the plot as a pesky hindrance to greatness squarely in their place.  Plot, he points out, is the foundation upon which a story is told, and even writers who claim they simply sit down and write -- if they're honest -- would admit they actually have a fair amount of plot in mind when they start.  Just because they don't make outlines doesn't mean their stories spontaneously generate from some fabled artistic well that only they can tap.<br /><br />Each of the plotting problems new writers fall victim to is named and dissected, and then solutions to the problems are presented.  Unlike some of the other currently popular books on writing, this one doesn't glibly promise that it's easy and anyone can do it; writing a novel is one tough endeavor, and you have to do it right if you want it read.  Shortcuts don't cut it.<br /><br />What doesn't work:  True to its academic origins, this book is as much about analysis of the novel as a form as it is about writing a novel.  There's hardly a shred of nuts-and-bolts, practical how-to.  The flaw in this is that, by the time a person decides to write a novel, he probably already has a pretty darn good appreciation of the form.<br /><br />If you're looking for lists of the different types of plots and how to make them work, this probably isn't your book.

US	51703175	R3U5QCWFMGTJFC	0750924934	935469914	Medieval Outlaws	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Epic tales of lawlessness, bawdiness, and yes . . .  dragons	As an informal student of medieval history, I've been hearing for years of the impressive body of literature from that age, tales of dragon slayers, romance, and highwaymen.  Until recently, most of what I'd read had been \\"adaptations\\" that felt so \\"modern\\" that I thought they must be considerably distanced from the original works.  Thanks to Mr. Ohlgren and the translators whose work appears in _Ten Tales_, I have now come as close to experiencing the real thing as I ever will without learning Latin and Old French.<br /><br />Reading the stories of Hereward the Wake, Robin Hood, and William Wallace, I was struck by the myriad ways classic mythic structure -- the same structure that defines everything from _The Odyssey_ to _The Terminator_ -- can be put to work by writers.  There really are no new stories under the sun; yet some writers have that gift of making the ancient new again, and we keep coming back for more.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks medieval literature was as sanitized and full of subtlety as its Victorian counterpart will be in for a shock.  Don't read these tales if graphic violence, blatant innuendo and sexual situations offend you.<br /><br />Stylistically, the _Ten Tales_ have more in common with _The Odyssey_ than they do with _The Terminator_.  Stories are narrated straight through without dialogue or direct action, and this leaves it to the reader to flesh out the details for himself.  A certain amount of reading between the lines is essential, and this can make reading tough at first.  But by the time I'd finished the first story, I had the knack of it and was too riveted to care that I wasn't being spoon-fed.  In addition, these are poems translated, usually as prose, so you won't get the same reading experience a medieval would have had.  Much of the original cadences and their dramatic effects are sacrificed in favor of the most accurate literal translations.<br /><br />In much the same way a modern historical novelist \\"fills in\\" gaps in known facts about real historical figures, medieval chroniclers took considerable license with those areas of their real-life subjects' lives about which little was known or nothing interesting happened.  During the years Fulk FitzWarin was exiled from England, we \\"learn\\" that he visited Spain and north Africa, as well as distant northern isles, where he slaughtered dragons, saved fair maidens, and fought as the champion of a Saracen king, whom he also converted to Christianity.  (Never mind that it's more likely Fulk spent all that time just across the Channel in France.)<br /><br />Strip away the mythological divergences, however, and these stories are much closer to reality than modern interpretations of the same characters.  Robin Hood wasn't a noble; the execution of William Wallace (\\"Braveheart\\") was far more grisly than in Mel Gibson's version.  These _Ten Tales_ will be engrossing reading for any adventure fan who doesn't mind thinking while she reads, and, paired with scholarly commentary, they add new dimensions to the medieval enthusiast's understanding.s in known facts about real historical figures, medieval chroniclers took considerable license with those areas of their real-life subjects' lives about which little was known or nothing interesting happened.

Elizabeth Chadwick offers a partial explanation in this rousing tale of medieval love, war and political intrigue.  Like many of Chadwick's novels, it is loosely based on real historical figures and events.<br /><br />It's a few months after the Conquest, and, among the Saxon nobles being held in Rouen, France by a distrustful King William is Earl Waltheof of Huntingdon.  The King's niece, Judith, immediately feels drawn to this giant of a man with his Viking looks.  Waltheof is even more certain of his own desires:  He decides then and there that he will have Judith for a wife.  When William refuses to grant him Judith's hand, Waltheof takes part in a rebellion against his new king.  The rebellion is put down, but William comes to see the prudence of a familial alliance with this young earl who is so beloved by the English people.<br /><br />Now married, Judith and Waltheof face the real challenges of their relationship.  Their loyalties are nearly opposite, and the strong personalities that made courtship exciting are a hindrance to wedded happiness.  When Waltheof makes another misstep, Judith must make the most wrenching choice of her life, one whose consequences will endure for her lifetime and beyond.<br /><br />Love isn't always enough to bring about a \\"happily ever after,\\" and at no time was this more true than in the Middle Ages.  The dilemmas faced by the real people in THE WINTER MANTLE are compelling, heartbreaking, and anything but black and white.  Yet not all hope is lost, and each character finds, in the end, his or her own version of closure.<br /><br />As if being the consummate storyteller wasn't enough, Elizabeth Chadwick is a master of medieval history.  If you want to know how they really lived, loved, fought and died, there's no more pleasurable way to find out.  Sharon Kay Penman is mesmerizing, and meticulous with dates and events, but she doesn't bring us nearly as close to the splendor and grit of the medieval world, nor to the peculiarities of the medieval mindset.<br /><br />One final note:  In case you don't already know it, there are TWO Elizabeth Chadwicks, and Amazon does a poor job of differentiating between them.  Amazon has even been known to offer a book by this EC along with one by that \\"other\\" EC as a \\"Better Together\\" selection.  Rule of Thumb:  If it has a lurid title, like ELUSIVE LOVERS or WANTON ANGEL, it was not written by the Elizabeth Chadwick who wrote THE WINTER MANTLE, LORDS OF THE WHITE CASTLE and THE LOVE KNOT, among many other greats., but she doesn't bring us nearly as close to the splendor and grit of the medieval world, nor to the peculiarities of the medieval mindset. <br /> <br />One final note:  In case you don't already know it, there are TWO Elizabeth Chadwicks, and Amazon does a poor job of differentiating between them.

Both traits come across loud and clear in this book.  Reading her easy, straightforward, advice-rich prose is like having a conversation with the wise, affectionate aunt you never had.  And, without a doubt, her collection of helpful sites for writers and speakers is unparalleled.  She had pretty much every link in my own Internet bookmark folder, plus about 25-30% more than I had -- and mine were considerable, being the result of more than six years as a writer.  Without a doubt, this book will stay next to my computer and become dogeared from all the love and attention it gets from me.<br /><br />That said, I do have a slight issue with the marketing of this book as pure Internet reference, because that's not exactly what it is.  Ms. Leal's target audience is actually NOT the seasoned writer or speaker who just needs to rev up his or her personal research engine.  She's writing for, and to, beginning writers and aspiring professional speakers.  Much of her book (some entire chapters and several partial chapters) is devoted to introducing neophytes to the craft and the business of writing or speaking.  Thus, considering my six years of experience as a writer, I found myself skimming great swaths of text, with my eyes pausing only when I glimpsed the italic print with which all those juicy internet links are helpfully set apart.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This book is most definitely worth the $10 Amazon will charge you for it, and more.  However, its scope is, in my opinion, a bit broad.  It would be more useful to professional writers and speakers if it came in a separate, streamlined edition -- one without all the newbie advice we've already heard and benefited from long ago.	2004-10-03

Every bit as suspenseful as REBECCA but with a more engaging heroine, it kept me on the edge of my seat almost from the beginning.<br /><br />Mary Yellan's mother dies, leaving her alone with a farm and no one to help her run it.  (Apparently, in 19th century England, it was unthinkable that a 23-year-old woman should simply hire some help and keep the farm.)  She sells up and goes to live in a distant county with an aunt she hasn't seen for ten years, but whom she remembers as pretty and vivacious.  The aunt Patience she finds, however, is much changed.  Now married to an abusive, drunken tyrant, Patience has relinquished her former self and become a cringing, wheedling shadow to her brutal husband.  The couple reside at Jamaica Inn, an infamous establishment that respectable travelers have long abandoned.<br /><br />The situation deteriorates further when inquisitive Mary discovers her uncle is involved in illegal dealings that include murder.  Horrified, she stays at Jamaica Inn only for the sake of her aunt, whom she intends to rescue.  She's befriended by the sympathetic vicar of a neighboring parish, and by her uncle's handsome brother, Jem, to whom she feels oddly drawn, despite his questionable livelihood as a horse thief.<br /><br />In true Gothic style, the story hovers on the edges of believability.  It doesn't pay to think too much on any one point.  Mary displays the obligatory intelligence, pluck and curiosity of the gothic heroine, yet loses her courage and/or her smarts at just the points where her hesitation advances the plot.  The villains of the story are pure evil without clear motivations.  Jem is the most realistically drawn character.<br /><br />But they don't write like Daphne DuMaurier anymore.  Her richly descriptive style sets you squarely down in the midst of the Cornish moors, makes you see the stark granite rocks, feel the heavy air closing around you. Her pacing is nearly perfect, dragging only in one or two spots where I think she falters in her effort to prolong suspense.  The story moves along so briskly that you're almost hypnotized into not noticing the plot's weaknesses.  It certainly isn't hard to shuffle them to the back of your mind.<br /><br />JAMAICA INN is well worth the read, especially if you're feeling a bit weary of \\"flavor-of-the-month\\" fiction.  In particular, I found Ms. DuMaurier's portrayal of the local squire as a kind-hearted, blustering dullard interesting.  I wonder if that was a reflection of current (1936) British attitudes toward the gentry.  In a similar vein, the vicar's thoughts on religion must have been provocative at the time.around you.

Bly takes all those niggling apprehensions you have about launching a freelance business and dispels them one by one.  He explains how to pinpoint your niche, how to market your services, how to assemble a portfolio, and how to gloss over prospective clients' questions when you don't yet have an extensive portfolio.  There are also practical suggestions on working at home, and on the writing life, and even a few elementary pointers on copywriting that are especially helpful to someone making the jump from fiction writing.  The appendix contains a treasure of forms and sample letters.<br /><br />I have only two very minor beefs with this book.<br /><br />First, it's in need of an update:  The latest edition was released in the mid-90s and is quite lacking in information about internet marketing and opportunities for internet-related work.<br /><br />Second, it, for the most part, assumes that the reader has professional writing experience, which would be a huge leg up in beginning a freelance business.  There's very little in the way of suggestions for people who have talent and skill, but who never had a job that let them use them.  (And who, in the case of yours truly, are making quite a bit more in their non-writing job than they ever could in an entry-level writing position.)<br /><br />All in all, however, Bly's book is an excellent introduction to the career of freelance business writing that has gone far in advancing my understanding of the field and confidence in myself as I enter it.

She yearns for something more, though she's not worldly enough to know what the \\"something\\" is until a simple red ribbon, suspended in the folds of a peddler's coat, inspires in her a need so great that she allows herself to be raped in payment for it.  As a result of the encounter, Mary becomes pregnant and is banished from her home and family for her shame.  Further brutalized in a gutter on her first night on her own, Mary is rescued by Doll, a prostitute who lacks morals but not kindness.<br /><br />Almost inevitably, the unskilled Mary becomes a prostitute under the tutelage of Doll.  She's soon seduced by the money she can earn and the colorful clothes that money buys, as well as by her newfound \\"freedom.\\"  Plying \\"the trade\\" on the dirty and pitiless streets of London, Mary grows up fast.  She develops a knack for reading people and manipulating them; yet, emotionally, she remains a child, tender and disastrously confused.<br /><br />Eventually, a series of misfortunes sends Mary fleeing from London for her life.  She travels to distant Monmouth, where her parents had met before leaving to seek their fortunes in London.  Concocting a story about her \\"dead\\" mother's last wish, Mary secures a place in the household of her mother's erstwhile best friend, a dressmaker.<br /><br />For the first time in her life, Mary experiences a nurturing environment, has people who care about her.  Although her arrogance wins her no friends amongst the other servants, she feels happy for a time and learns to be an excellent seamstress.  But her old demons still haunt her.  Her yearning for the fine garments and fine lives of her employer's clients becomes insufferable.  She regresses and begins living the kind of double life that can't last in a small town.<br /><br />Emma Donoghue's richly-hued prose unflinchingly recreates the brutality and degradation of eighteenth-century London's seamy side.  Her secondary characters are anything but secondary; many of them could respectably carry their own stories.  Not being conversant in the history of this period, I can't speak to historical accuracy, but nothing struck me as shaky or implausible.  It was all frighteningly real.<br /><br />Many of the editorial reviews excerpted on the cover of the trade paper edition contain phrases like \\"rollicking romp,\\" \\"swoon of a novel,\\" and \\"costume drama.\\"  Those are terms to be applied to a Regency romance; they are an insult to this dark, tragic story and its deeply conflicted heroine.  I don't think the reviewers who made those comments actually read the book.  It kept me turning pages and reading far into the night, because I saw the kernel of good in Mary and kept hoping she'd get some sense and do something right just once.  Turn her life around.

Among these are two Irish sisters who bring with them little more than the clothes they wear and their late mother's hope chest.  Moira and Julia O'Leary appear as different as can be - one light and the other dark; one strong and bold, and the other frail and quiet.  The two young women share a strong bond, however - one that is nearly as much about shared guilt as it is about family.<br /><br />Within days of their arrival in Boston, the two find employment in domestic service.  Julia faithfully attends mass each Sunday morning, while Moira - having abandoned religion after the untimely death of their mother - cleans out the coal stove.  Four years into their new life, a chance meeting with one of their fellow Irish passengers results in marriage for Moira and yet another new life for both women.<br /><br />Moira's Crossing follows the O'Leary sisters, and the family that takes shape around them, for more than forty years.  Although the story is essentially hers, Moira remains somewhat enigmatic to the reader.  Still, she claims our empathy and our hearts, for her weaknesses and her strengths are our own.  We understand her as well as we understand ourselves.<br /><br />Left with a misshapen face from a forceps-assisted birth, Julia never marries, instead focusing on her faith, her intensive study of homeopathy, and, most of all, on Moira's family.  The sisters need one another for very different reasons.  Despite a reserved nature and ill health, Julia possesses an inner strength on which Moira relies heavily.  Julia's self-realization is achingly gradual and would never happen at all were it not for her devotion to - and subtle rivalry with - Moira.<br /><br />Through narrative so sensitively crafted that it often seems to flow straight from the minds of her characters, Christina Shea ushers us into the lives of real people whose loves, triumphs and heartbreaks mirror our own.

In Holland, the resourceful Margarethe is soon married to a wealthy widower, and Iris finds herself stepsister to the unnaturally beautiful but melancholy Clara.<br /><br />Contemptuous of  her own beauty, Clara shuns society, taking refuge amid the cinders of the family hearth.  When Margarethe goads Clara's father into a foolhardy investment that results in his ruin, slow starvation seems the family's likely fate.  But once again, Iris's mother has the perfect plan.  \\"Give me room to cast my eel spear,\\" she urges, \\"and let follow what may.\\"<br /><br />Will this familiar tale be told in the expected way, we might wonder, or will the author surprise us with unexpected character reversals and plot twists?<br /><br />Neither -- and both.  Maguire's narrative holds with tradition while taking us beneath the surface of this cut-and-dried morality tale to show us real people possessed of grievous flaws, redeeming virtues, and compelling motivations.  While some of them are wondrously transformed, others are revealed as bearing little resemblance to what they first seemed.<br /><br />This retelling is neatly slotted with actual period events, and cleverly glosses over the implausible elements of the fairy tale.  There is a glass slipper, sort of.  There really is a prince who seeks a wife from amongst commoners, and he has a credible reason for doing so.  There's even a fairy godmother, though she appears in a rather unlikely guise.<br /><br />Maguire's uncluttered yet richly evocative prose makes Confessions an effortless read.  His insightful characterizations and his inventive rendering of a tale with which we're all familiar make it a worthwhile and rewarding read as well.	2004-08-14

Third in a trilogy of early Mexico that began with Aztec and continued with Aztec Autumn, Aztec Blood was partially ghostwritten from Jennings's own notes and research.  As a result, it's inferior to his other works, like Raptor, Journeyer and the first two Aztec books.  It's closer to a pure adventure novel.  Still, there's plenty of insight into politics, religion and injustice, and it's all packaged up with that signature Jennings objectivity.<br /><br />Cristo the Bastard is the son of a Spanish father and an Aztec mother in a time and place where mixed blood makes him legally less than human.  But he uses a superior intellect, a little well-placed luck, and a remarkable ability to reinvent himself to stunning advantage.  The beggar from the dusty streets of Veracruz becomes a bandito; the bandito later emerges as a Spanish gentleman.  Cristo pursues wealth and position not for its own sake, but that he might be worthy of the beautiful Spanish lady he loves.<br /><br />This story is more than mere adventure, however.  Jennings paints an unapologetic picture of seventeenth-century Mexico:  A rampantly corrupt government.  Natives who are not always innocent victims.  Priests devoted to caring for the poor, and priest-inquisitors devoted to the refinements of torture.<br /><br />Diminishing the story somewhat are grammatical errors so numerous that it would seem the first draft went straight to the typesetter without first crossing an editor's desk.  Such a liability might render the average novel unworthy of reading.  But Aztec Blood, with its brilliant plot, flawless pacing and fascinating characters, is anything but average.  It is a marvelous adventure brimming with love, mystery and danger - one whose ending leaves the reader feeling immensely satisfied, yet frustrated that there isn't any more.	2004-08-14

Some characters could be fascinating, yet they're never brought into clear focus.  Even Isaac himself, who is sharper without his vision than most of us are with it, never quite comes to life.

To Evariste, mathematics is its own reward, a refuge of logic in a chaotic world.  It is the key to unlock the secrets of the universe.  It is a new and superior religion.  He vows he will be the first to solve the quintic, a complex equation that has confounded many great minds.<br /><br />There are obstacles in his path to this goal.  First, he must struggle to suppress his own emerging sexuality.  Then, there are the schoolmates who continually goad and harass him to join their Republican groups.  Less easily ignored are the grievous social inequities and turmoil surrounding him.  When his father dies, an alleged suicide, Evariste at last begins to question his singular devotion to mathematics.<br /><br />Evariste tells his own story, addressing himself to an imaginary biographer who shadows him throughout the book, experiencing events as he does, all in present tense.  While this type of narration can be off-putting, Petsinis utilizes it respectably and often with great drama.  He adeptly conveys to the reader information that the self-absorbed and oblivious protagonist himself misses.  Petsinis's prose is rich with original and evocative metaphors and similes, and his flair for verb choice gives the story a distinctively realistic feel.<br /><br />Egotistical and insolent, Evariste is difficult to like at the outset.  Yet the reader soon glimpses the fragile and idealistic heart of an insecure young man possessed of remarkable mental gifts.  As the story unfolds, the reader comes to understand the noble soul of Evariste Galois -- his consuming desire to give his life to a meaningful cause and to attain immortality through his work.he fragile and idealistic heart of an insecure young man possessed of remarkable mental gifts.

Once on this pedestal, however, Alkibiades resorts to the same murderous tactics used by his old foes.<br /><br />Gentle's fifteenth-century heroine in \\"The Logistics of Carthage\\" followed her son to war, discovered that she preferred a soldier's life to a prostitute's, and joined a company of European mercenaries.  Now, her company finds itself stranded on the coast of North Africa with a corpse they cannot bury because of a religious dispute.  During a tense and bloody standoff, Yolande has what she believes are visions, but which are actually glimpses of the future 500 years hence.  This was the least satisfactory story, as it seemed not to have much of a point.  It might make more sense to fans of Gentle's \\"Ash\\" series.<br /><br />In \\"The Last Ride of German Freddie,\\" Williams plunks German philosopher Frederich Nietzsche onto the dusty streets of 1881 Tombstone, Arizona and pits him against the Earp brothers.  Nietzsche tries his hand at some trigger-assisted social engineering at the OK Corral.  But is it really social engineering, or merely the vengefulness of a man thwarted in love?<br /><br />With Shikhari in Galveston, Stirling brings us the most inventive and fully-realized of these four universes:  a radically different present-day Earth that, in the nineteenth century, saw her population slashed and much of her land rendered scarcely habitable by a catastrophic heavenly bombardment.  The British Empire still reigns - albeit not supremely - over much of what remains.  A British officer and his Indian servant travel to the wilds of southern Texas for a hunting expedition, and, rather than hunting for trophies, find themselves fighting for their lives against an adversary unlike any they ever imagined.<br /><br />Those who, like me, are new to alternate history, or just not well versed in the real history behind the fiction, will benefit from first reading the afterword accompanying each novella.s for a hunting expedition, and, rather than hunting for trophies, find themselves fighting for their lives against an adversary unlike any they ever imagined. <br /> <br />Those who, like me, are new to alternate history, or just not well versed in the real history behind the fiction, will benefit from first reading the afterword accompanying each novella.	2004-08-14

Her employers' tragedy ends that job, but not before Anna has been exposed to another world where books abound, knowledge is prized, and the love between a husband and wife is tender and unabashed.  Anna is never the same.<br /><br />Back home in Faith, North Carolina, she meets John Bayley, a twice-widowed farmer, a man driven to prove himself on more than one level.  John knows a good thing when he sees it and sets out to win Anna.  Although ultimately, she gives in to her passion for John, Anna knows she could be giving up her chance at the higher kinds of fulfillment she needs.<br /><br />At first glance, Anna might seem to be an ordinary North Carolina farmer's wife near the turn of the last century, only prettier.  Her hands are toughened from hard work; her countenance is stern yet compassionate.  She sacrifices for the good of her children.  But there is much more.  Anna possesses a depth that her peers seem to lack -- a depth witnessed by a precious few of those who know her.  She thinks more, understands profoundly, and secretly longs for what might have been had she not married.  She incurs John's displeasure and risks ostracism by abandoning the church.  John occasionally glimpses his wife's mysterious core, and he both fears and resents what he does not understand.<br /><br />Salt is a fascinating study of characters removed from us as much by mindset as by years.  Still, both Anna and John possess the flaws and the virtues that render their struggles timeless.	2004-08-14
US	51703175	RIPIX59GHJYX6	0060000805	178480096	The Treasure of Montsegur: A Novel of the Cathars	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Inspiring	Jeanne was raised by a Cathar holy woman.  The man Jeanne loved married her best friend, and eventually, the three of them faced death by burning after the siege of the Cathar enclave at Montsegur.  A bitter reprieve, however, sent Jeanne out of harm's way and on a mission to save precious remnants of her Cathar religion.  She cannot forgive herself for failing in that mission and for not mounting the pyre with the two people she loved most.<br /><br />Thirteenth-century France is a perilous place for Christians whose doctrine differs from that of the Roman Catholic Church, but poverty confers the protective mantle of invisibility.  Once lady of her own manor, Jeanne is now just another beggar, a hag dependent upon the charity of her betters.  When her latest benefactor recognizes her for a Cathar -- hence a heretic -- Jeanne must flee for her life.<br /><br />With the Inquisition bearing down upon her, Jeanne stumbles upon an unlikely deliverer who diverts the inquisitors from her trail and then takes her in.  She finds unexpected love with this strong and simple man.<br /><br />But Jeanne's past continues to haunt her.  Her happy interlude ends, and she must face her darkest fears.  At the lowest point in her life, she discovers the true treasure of Montsegur and finds in herself the grace and courage of perfect faith.<br /><br />Ms. Burnham recreates her setting with integrity.  Though her story is more about religious wars in general than medieval France, she paints historical detail over her narrative with spare but sure strokes.  The Treasure of Montsegur is worthwhile for its illumination of the Cathars' plight and for the extraordinary character of Jeanne.	2004-08-14

After attending military school, he serves as an ambulance driver for the British Army during the Zulu Rebellion.  From an Indian sergeant-major called Bapu (who will later change his name and become a central figure in Indian history), David learns the secret that enables him to make an astounding escape from a Zulu cave prison.  After the war, David travels to England to pursue a medical education.<br /><br />Foremost in his devotion is the intrepid British explorer Maud King.  Maud's character is based on the real-life explorer of the period, Mary Kingsley.  Sixteen years David's senior, Maud captivates him as no other woman ever will.  The two share more than just an affinity for the peoples, flora and fauna of West Africa.  They are soul mates in the deepest sense of the term.  While their age difference raises eyebrows amongst Maud's fellow gentry in England, the true obstacle to their happiness is Maud's passion for her work.<br /><br />Mr. Danze fills this short tale with unforgettable secondary characters and subplots and wraps the whole package in a spare, elegant prose that reads easily and suits his subject matter well.	2004-08-14

A street urchin discovers a dead girl, and chance leads his path across that of struggling journalist Edgar Allan Poe.  Ever the alert profiteer, Augie Dubbins reveals his grisly find to Poe in exchange for a coin.  The two then find themselves navigating a labyrinth of contradictory evidence and repelling attempts both on their lives and on their integrity in order to expose the murder's identity and motive.  In so doing, man and boy find in each other a commonality that transcends their divergent backgrounds.  Poe is the nearest thing to a father Augie has ever known; his home and family life are paradise to a child who has known only squalor and violence.  Augie serves a purpose for Poe as well, becoming a no-nonsense, street-smart caretaker when Poe's dark instabilities cast their enervating shadow on him.<br /><br />Silvis recreates 1840s New York with an unstinting and often brutal clarity.  His elegant, evocative prose is suggestive of Poe's own style and his narrative integrates elements from Poe's more popular works.  The characters, real and fictional alike, are masterpieces of insight into the human experience.  Nowhere is this insight more evident than in the author's rendering of Edgar Allan Poe, a brilliant, compassionate and fatally complex man whose devotion to his work was exceeded only by his love for his family.	2004-08-14
US	51703175	R31N2SGLG9KVTH	0374168199	45126905	Here's to you, Jesusa	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Realistic and poignant, though narrative is a bit lacking	First published in Spanish in 1969, Here's to You, Jesusa! is the fictional autobiography of a poor Mexican woman.  This Latin American classic has recently been translated into English.<br /><br />Jesusa's life is fraught with hardship and grievous injustice.  Mistreated by her stepmother and abandoned by her father, fourteen-year-old Jesusa is forced to marry an abusive army officer who, out of jealousy, takes her with him to war.  When he is killed a few years later, a corrupt government denies her the small compensation of the widow's pension it owes her.  Still very young and left alone with neither income nor skills, Jesusa nearly starves.<br /><br />Experience teaches her toughness, and her personality is as fraught with contradictions as the political milieu of the Mexican Revolution in which she fought.  She is a loner who lets friends exploit her.  Outwardly she is cold, yet she raises a motherless child whom no one wants.  Despite her insistence that the child means nothing to her, her pain at his desertion is obvious.  When he returns years later, she takes him in, knowing he intends to steal from her.  His greedy quest amuses her, for she has nothing for him to steal.<br /><br />Ms. Poniatowska spent several years getting to know the woman she based her character on, and it shows.  However, first person narration by an inarticulate protagonist weakens the story, making it a tedious and sometimes obscure read.  It might also be that something is lost in translation.<br /><br />Here's to You, Jesusa! provides rare insight into what it was like to be poor and female in early twentieth-century Mexico. Jesusa is too complex to be fictional and her story too poignant not to engage even the most dispassionate reader.	2004-08-14

The Bhopal gas tragedy provides the event that sets this story in motion, but if you're worried this will be a political book about social injustice, don't.  A Breath of Fresh Air is about people, their mistakes, and the ways they deal with them.  The characters will draw you in and keep you there.  They are, without exception, sympathetic and multi-faceted.  Ms. Malladi obviously knows -- and loves -- each of them very well.  She does an excellent job of illustrating how each is affected by his culture and the consequences some of them suffer for trying to &quot;buck the system.&quot;  Before reading this book, I knew very little of contemporary Indian culture, so it was a special bonus for me to look for a bit through the eyes of an Indian woman.	2002-09-19
