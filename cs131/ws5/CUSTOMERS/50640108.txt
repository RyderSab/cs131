There are six essays here written by different authors. The best is the introduction to Morse theory by Forman. This author is gifted with the ability to know when to include and exclude detail so as to not lose the developing intuitive thrust. What this book recognizes, perhaps not explicitly, is that there are different learning styles amoung undergraduates and this text has something to offer in this regard. For example, many undergraduates need to see numbers computed and be connected to a physical experiment in order to grasp and motivate the math. The essay on modeling traffic flow and the one on the inquiry into plucked strings will satisfy those readers. The more legalistic undergrads will appreciate the minimal surfaces essays. Since the entire book seems to have been written by the math faculty at Rice university, it seems that whoever put that department together did a great job of eclectic casting in assembling such a talented group of teachers.	2005-07-11

The rest of it is too vague to be of much use. Useful questions should be specific enough to narrow down a solution by exercising the various methods of lateral thinking. For example, you should be able to come up with a specific solution by considering ways in which your assumptions affect how you understand the question. This book has too many &quot;why did the chicken cross the road?&quot; questions that require you to be psychic in order to get anywhere near the solution or require you to pull some obscure fact out of the clear blue sky.	2002-03-12

There are many useful examples that are sprinkled throughout the text that motivate the discussion. The solutions to the problems are also provided. This book is suitable for advanced undergraduate. Although I don't have any major complaints about the book, there already exists a much better book with many more exercises, diagrams, and much more thorough development and extension of the principal concepts. That book is Jones' &quot;Lebesgue integration on Euclidean space&quot;, which I cannot recommend highly enough.	2001-10-08

For example, I have never seen a complex contour integral interpreted geometrically. Also, the text presents many very important conformal maps. Having said that, however, I would not recommend this as a first book in complex analysis. A better first book along these same visual lines, but with more rigor is Flanigan's &quot;Complex Analysis&quot;. On the other hand,  if you already have a more traditional grounding in complex analysis and want to motivate many of the results geometrically, then this book is uniquely suited for that. This book provides useful &quot;explanations&quot; and not rigorous proofs.	2001-10-08

There are so many amazingly useful concepts developed here. For example, the estimation of difficult integrals and the use of polynomial generating functions as a way to handle many combinatoric problems are carefully developed here. These are the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of analysis that are usually taken for granted in other textbooks. The author sincerely tries to develop the ideas behind each of the concepts. My only complaint is that there are not enough exercises that illuminate the important concepts that are discussed. Also, sometimes the author seems rushed in his exposition, which really makes it hard for the reader to keep up. This book is part of the series that in general I highly recommend. In fact, this is probably one of the top five books in the problem series.	2001-10-08

The technique of Euler-Lagrange multipliers is clearly illuminated with numerous detailed and worked out examples.

The choice of problems is good, but there is no introductory exposition into the concept that is to be explored. The solutions are not explicitly developed. Sometimes, they consist of merely the answer.<br />This text is good as a supplement to an ongoing class in graduate-level real analysis where one has access to an instructor and other students for help. Otherwise, this is not a good book for self-study.	2001-07-31

What's even more unusual is that the author succeeds in explaining differential operators at this level. I found the discussions on the Legendre and Hermite operators especially illuminating. There are numerous worked examples and exercises. The real accomplishment of this text is that the author has managed to select results that are of crucial importance, omitting some important theorems along the way, but maintaining the core idea. That is a difficult trick.	2001-06-08

The prerequisites are a working knowledge of Linear algebra and undergraduate calculus. What distinguishes this text from other books on advanced calculus is that it focuses at the outset on R^N instead of on the real line. The advantage of starting out with R^N is that the reader becomes more quickly accustomed to the notation and can subsequently interpret the real line is a special case more easily. Later sections in the book cover exterior algebra and differential calculus and integration on manifolds. There is a discussion of the Lebesgue integral in R^N also. The notation is very clean and there are interesting exercises with corresponding numerical answers in the appendix. The writing is well paced, with a uniform level of difficulty throughout. I recommend this for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student.	2001-06-08

If you're graphically oriented, like I am, then this itself is enough to recommend this book. Concepts such as branch points and multivalued complex functions are much easier to understand when there is a picture to accompany the concept. The second half of the book is concerned with applications and includes several useful asymptotic methods such as Laplace's integral method. These asymptotic techniques are good for evaluating particularly nasty integrals in which the integrand is really concentrated somewhere in the interval. On the downside, this is not a very formally rigorous book. On the other hand, such formalism is easier to digest once you've seen numerous pictures and examples, in my own opinion.	2001-06-07

The development of the underlying real variable theory is much more rigorous than the closely related and more recent text &quot;Numerical Recipes in C&quot;. Also, there is more attention paid to function theoretic considerations such as notions of continuity and compactness. This is basically an introductory numerical functional analysis textbook.

None of the underlying real variable theory is explored in the detail. Basically, an undergraduate exposure to calculus and linear algebra is all that is required. The basic topics are covered such as integration, numerical differentiation, and interpolation. There are numerous worked out examples and the text is sprinkled with snippets of Fortran code.

The standard topics are covered: uniform approximation, least squares approximation, polynomial and spline interpolation, and approximation and interpolation by rational functions. Each of these topics deals with real valued functions of a real variable.<br />This book suits someone who has a good basic understanding of functional analysis: compact sets, uniform continuity, basic operator theory. Having said that, this book is actually quite good because instead of just listing the standard results accompanied with the tightest proofs, the author usually take a motivating approach to each of the results. He often starts out with a certain line of reasoning, demonstrates the resulting complications, and then picks up another line of reasoning that makes the result more apparent. This is very instructive because it gives you an insight to the &quot;dress reversal&quot; instead of just the &quot;performance&quot;.	2001-04-27

First, the problem is spelled out entirely, so you don't need to refer to the text. It is self-contained, for the most part. Each of the solutions is worked out with generous detail and the problems are chosen to accentuate certain basic results that are easy to take for granted unless you see the difficulties that arise in their absence. I recommend this text for self-study as a running start to Polya and Szego's more difficult problem book.	2001-04-27

It is most useful only when you have been introduced to the material elsewhere and want to get the author's perspective on it. The author certainly has a very subtle perspective on the material. I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but this material is covered much more clearly in &quot;Principles of Mathematical Analysis&quot; by Rudin.  I think this is true for two reasons.  First, Rudin breaks down the key results into smaller pieces; second, his choice of notation is more consistent and clearer.  Another good book on the same topic is &quot;Advanced Calculus&quot; by Loomis.	2000-12-11

This book is principally a collection of results in complex analysis.  The upside is that there are many problems developed in detail and the author sincerely tries to motivate every topic.  The downside is that the language is so dated that often topics are excessively difficult to digest.  I would not recommend this as a first book in complex functions theory.  It's more useful as a supplement to other more modern courses.	2000-11-27

First, it is one of the rare books in approximation theory that covers complex analytic functions.  Second, the selection and presentation of the material is unusually clear and full of useful examples.  The author balances the level of generality against  the usefulness of the result. In other words, he avoids the trap of stating the result in such a high level of generality that the usefulness of the result is completely obscured. Another good book in this area at a slightly higher level of difficulty is &quot;Theory of Approximation&quot; by Achieser.  This book is suitable for self study by a graduate student in the first year or a very advanced undergraduate.	2000-11-18

The great strength of this text is its focus on the development of sufficient and necessary conditions for constrained/unconstrained minima/maxima.  There are good examples regarding maximum likelihood estimation. There are also some useful results regarding the Kronecker product and commutator matrices. The chapter at the end covers specific topics in  econometrics. The paperback edition suffers from completely hideous typesetting that is exacerbated by some of the notation.

The notation is often impenetrable and there is not a uniform level of rigor in the text. Some  results are presented in detail, and others sort of assume you've seen them  before.

This book is based on a graduate course and provides a good introduction to  distribution theory and generalized Fourier analysis. You  need to have a  good background in advanced calculus and be comfortable with Lebesgue  theorems  concerning interchangeable limit processes. The examples are  quite good, but the notation is intense and the way that it is packed in  small font onto a page doesn't help.

This means that the logic is easier to understand because of  the way he standardizes his symbols and lays out the logical flow of  different prove techniques.  Many examples are worked out in detail. I  recommend this book to anyone (especially engineering students) without  formal training in mathematics (but who can program computers), who need to  understand very formal mathematical material. The presentation is  strengthened by the author's use of basic set theory to illustrate the  proof technique.  This means that the results you're trying to prove are   often pretty obvious, but this allows you to concentrate on the technique  of proof  in question. Also check out Polya's book of the same name.	2000-06-12

This book should be passed out to every undergraduate taking the first mathematical analysis course.  Numerous examples and exercises are  included.  The typesetting and notation are very readable.  The great  strength of this book is that the proofs used for exercises are restricted  to the level of algebra and set theory. This makes it easy to concentrate  on the technique of proof rather than the specific results. Also check out  Polya's book &quot;How to Prove It&quot; and Velleman's book of the same  name.	2000-06-12

A very good first book on functional analysis. The book starts with preliminary set theory, logic, functions, and concepts of abstract algebra and moves on to the big convergence theorems in the Lebesgue integration  and onto topological and metric spaces.  The book ends with basic theory of  Hilbert space. Each section concludes with exercises. The author takes  great pains to include a lot of detail in the proofs. I would recommend  this book to an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student.	2000-06-12

This is a more like the survey of the important topics in probability and stochastic processes.  There are appendices on information theory, game theory, and branching  processes.  The book includes basic concepts of probability, random  variables, and Markov chains. Feller has a better introductory book on  probability.	2000-06-12

It covers topics that  are relevant to many broad areas of real and functional analysis including  signal processing and approximation theory.  The author takes  the time not  only to prove the results, but also to construct the proofs  so that the  technique is made explicit to the reader. The author also  motivates  definitions by breaking them into the successively more  complicated pieces so  as to build intuition in the reader.<br />I especially  recommend this book  to anyone who lacks formal training in mathematics or  wishes to develop mathematical technique in the areas of real and  functional analysis.	2000-04-01
