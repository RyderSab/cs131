There isn't really any direction:  It is simply a download written in whatever order things happened to occur.  Actually, I liked this book; I thought Elizabeth Wurtzel had something to say, and she did a good job of getting her thoughts down in writing.  However, I would be slow to recommend More, Now, Again to anybody else.  I do not think it is a book that would appeal very much to the majority of people.   <br />	2005-09-17

US	49608473	R1G9FONH3CLWAA	0743411501	807587988	Life Inside: A Memoir	Books	4	1	5	N	N	Rugged	The story of Mindy Lewis' experience in a mental ward.  Rugged:  She did not have an easy time of it, and her story made me wonder how she survived.    Nonetheless, she did a good job of bringing this to life.  Very well written, and with a mature, factual point of view.  I felt this was well worth reading simply to learn about the subject, one I've experienced onlyfrom the outside (with a family member on the inside).  I learned much from Life Inside.  [The Quiet Room was another book, along similar lines, that was also excellent.  And, certainly, The Bell Jar.]	2005-08-28

An unpredictable plot, excellent character development, and many elements of wisdom from Charlotte Bronte.  I greatly enjoyed this novel, much as I did Jane Eyre and Villette.  In all honesty, this is a book that would not be for everyone.  However, for those who greatly like Charlotte Bronte's works, it is a great read.	2005-05-25
US	49608473	RX8746W5ONBIL	0743247531	657435935	The Glass Castle: A Memoir	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Powerful	A fast paced, powerful, stunning biography.  Jeannette Walls' mother said she was \\"addicted to adventure\\" and that is just how the family lived.  Never knew what was going to happen next, or how and certainly not why.  Just that it would be sudden, crazy, and far beyond anything you'd ever call normal.  An absolutely one-of-a-kind story!	2005-05-22
US	49608473	RUPSF17TABIVM	1901237044	402943068	Francie	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Biography of a True English Survivor	A well-written biography of the difficult life of an unbeatable lady.  Francie had a hard time, yet she somehow always ended up on the bright side of things.  She lived in the Newcastle area -- a place that well earned its rough & tumble reputation -- and she out-maneuvered or out-smarted everybody that took her on.  Despite her need to fight to survive, somehow she remained a person who you'd probably like to have known.  She did not go looking for trouble; she just stood up for herself when she had to.  I am glad this biography was written, and I wish it would become better known.	2005-05-19

The biography of an Irish miner who spent his life in the pit villages around Newcastle, England.  A story of somebody who was proud of his trade and, no doubt, excelled at it.  And who suffered all the hard knocks that went with the lives of the miners, many of which were due to the economic ups and downs of the industry.  How anybody could survive such a life?  Rough, to say the least!  At any rate, this is a remarkable story.	2005-05-19

He had a dry sense of humor and a very sharp eye (much like Dickens) and his writings are filled with his take on the local color.  And with the much bigger picture of life itself.<br /><br />Anyway, I very much did like David Balfour, and I am glad I read it.	2005-01-01

A Football Primer for Moms, Wives & Significant Others 2nd Edition	Books	5	58	59	N	Y	Actually, it's Even a book for Guys	You'd think every guy in America (if not the whole planet) knew the details of football.  Well, some -- albeit not many -- do not.  It was late in life that my interest in football (NFL & collegiate) really sparked, and I wanted to know much more about the strategy and workings of the game.  First I got the Idiot's Guide, and it was fine.  Then I got the Dummies book, and it helped as well.  But I was still confused on the very basics, which is \\"who is what player and how do they fit into the game?\\" <br />So, when I stumbled across Snot Bubbles, it looked to be worth a try.  Good choice!  It does cover the very basics, and does so very well!!! <br />So, to anyone else that really wants to know the absolute basics, this is a book to read.   <br />The others -- Idiot's and Dummies -- are also fine, although they are more detailed.  The Idiot's does an especially good job of explaining things worth knowing, like what is a Color Analyst, or a Hail Mary, and what do you mean by Snot Bubbles????	2005-01-01

My family came from the southeastern Missouri and western Kentucky areas, and I had long wondered about the history of the KY-MO region.  This book did a superb job of putting together the events and the context of the Civil War years.  The author's research was incredible; he rebuilt the trails in detail, and made \\"history talk\\" through the people who were actually there.  This book is one I would greatly recommend to anyone with an interest in American history.	2004-12-05

His works can be difficult to understand, with all the shades of meanings and the complicated plots, but Conrad's novels have always been worth the effort.  Victory was one of the more readable works; and one of the most spell-binding.  A great story by a great author:  I'm very glad I read this!	2004-11-21

Well written and most interesting.  I read this book out of curiosity about how Wal-Mart came into being, and what factors made it grow into the giant of the industry.  &quot;In Sam We Trust&quot; did go into the background of Sam Walton himself, without going into any special hero-hype or star-bashing, instead simply outlined the story as it happened.  From this, I learned much about the organization, and my questions were well answered.	2002-10-20

I have very much liked every one of her books and this one, I thought, was the best of them all.  Ladder of Years made me think about my own self and how I would respond if I, like Delia, were suddenly and indefinitely separated from my family.  It made me appreciate those around me more by causing me to recognize that they do not have to be perfect to be valuable, and no matter how trying they may sometimes be, I am glad to be in the family I have.  And I don't have to be perfect, either.	2001-09-09
