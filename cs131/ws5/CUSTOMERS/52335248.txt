She used a partially falsified background to fill her resume, since the best-selling author Barbara Ehrenreich would presumably be too recognizable: she used her real maiden name, Barbara Alexander, and claimed that she had been a freelance PR and event-planning consultant.<br /><br />Her partially fake resume probably held back her job search, although no one ever called her on it during her job search (and even though, as we Americans found out the hard way during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina with FEMA's Michael \\"Brownie\\" Brown, you can get a good job on the basis of a fake resume.)  Also, she wasted a lot of time on life coaches and networking groups.  These yielded some amusing anecdotes for her book, but were otherwise useless.<br /><br />I hope I am not giving away too much of the story by telling you that the original project never gets completed.  She can barely even get any interviews, let alone an actual job. The only job offer she gets is selling insurance for AFLAC.  And even that is not a real job with benefits: even though she would be selling health insurance to corporations in her area, she would not be able to use her own product.<br /><br />Her humor is much gentler than in \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" but this is in many ways an even more depressing book.  Ehrenreich paints a bleak picture of Corporate America which suggests that this is an institution which is in a profound state of spiritual decadence.	2005-09-21

So this is otensibly high powered advice aimed at \\"C-Level\\" executives and those who aspire to C-Level status.  The actual content of the book is simple, verging on simplistic.  This is an anthology of short, generally breezy articles from recent HBS newsletters giving advice so basic you wonder how the readers got to be where they are without knowing this stuff.      The main point of this book is that a company can't be successful unless workers are actually rewarded for doing their jobs competently (or better.)  It is a sad commentary on the state of Corporate America that this point even needs to be made. Another strangely obvious revelation in this book is that workers are more productive when management makes sure they have the tools they need to do their jobs.    In any case, this is (for the most part) a readable book, just the right size and length to read on your next plane flight.  The advice given by the various writers, simplistic though it is, is certainly not worthless.	2005-09-21

It's not quite as much fun as the first volume, where Dr. Fomenko outlined his radical historical theories.  This is something of an appendix to volume 1, showing how the timelines of the \\"First\\" through \\"Third\\" Roman empires, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and the Bible are all reflections of events which took place in socalled \\"Medieval\\" times.  The reason pre-1600 history tends to move in cycles of about 350 years (punctuated by Dark Ages) is, we are told, because there only is about 350 years of pre-1600 history in the first place. <br /> <br />Since I went through the Columbia University's \\"Contemporary Civilization\\" program as an undergraduate, I was personally amused to see that two Classical Greek writers who were conventionally viewed as being ancient and historically inaccurate (though still great)-- i.e., Homer and Herodotus--- are viewed here as being relatively recent and accurate (as well as great.) <br /> <br />Fomenko's timeline becomes even more radical in this book: for example, Fomenko now tells us that Jesus probably lived in the 1100s, not the 1000s.  And he was Russian. <br /> <br />We have a few volumes left before Fomenko gets around to British and American history.	2005-07-20

Mr. Gilbert devotes the first 100 pages or so to the lads' pre-Clash lives, and he even reveals that the Clash were in fact originally a manufactured boy band.  Their manager Bernie Rhodes put Joe Strummer, Mick Jones and Paul Simonon together primarily because they looked good: the fact that Joe & Mick turned out to be arguably the greatest songwriting team since Mick & Keith (or even John & Paul) was just a happy accident.<br /><br />There's not much about the band's post-history, which is unfortunate since the Clash were one of those bands who were more popular and more influential after they broke up than while they were still together.  (And also, Mick Jones' post-Clash band, Big Audio Dynamite were important in their own right, and Joe Strummer had a noteable solo career.)<br /><br />In any case, there's lots of lots of information in this book about the Clash and their entourage. All six core members of the band (including the two \\"other\\" drummers, Terry Chimes and Pete Howard) were interviewed, although Mick and Topper had very little to say and Joe (who was the central figure in the Clash legend) died in the middle of the project.<br /><br />If you like the Clash, you will like the book, though you may not love it.  The book has a few flaws: a meagre picture selction (even though the author talks a lot about how the band looks), a pedestrian writing style, and not enough info about the music itself. I am also not sure if all the details are 100% accurate.  For example, on pp. 250-251, we were told that the shot of Paul Simonon smashing his bass on the London Calling album was taken at precisely 9:50pm at the Palladium in New York.  I was at that show. It ended much later than that. At 9:50pm, Mitch Ryder (not mentioned in this book) would still have been performing.  For another example, the Black Market Clash album was listed as having been released in1991 when it actually came out in 1980.<br /><br />This book does not quite rate the full 5 stars, but it does tell a fascinating story.	2005-07-01

I could quibble with some of the choices he made.  He leaves out some things which perhaps he should have included, and includes others which he should have left out.  Also, like many modern-day scientists, he sometimes is a little condescending towards ancient philosophers, but in general he does a great job of integrating modern and anicent ideas.   <br /> <br />My complaint is that the book is the wrong size.  I have to admit I am not sure what size it should have been.  It is a standard 250-page trade book, but it really should have either been a thin pamphlet or a thick tome-- or possibly a richly illustrated coffee table book a la Carl Sagan's Cosmos.  Gleiser's book as it actually exists simultaneously feels like a thin pamphlet with extraneous anecdotes added to pad it out to \\"full\\" length and like an abridged synopsis of a magnum opus. <br /> <br />	2005-03-30

There's lots and lots of sex and drugs here, along with some rock and roll.  He structures it as the traditional tale of the slow rise to stardom, followed by a few years of excess with redemption and sobriety at the end of the road.  The joke is, however, that the rise to fame was pretty quick (though, thanks to drug use and bad recording contracts, fortune arrived long after fame did)--- and he has lost and found sobriety many times during a career which is now well into its third decade. <br /> <br />His writing (in collaboration with a ghostwriter named Larry Sloman) is engaging, his sense of humor is sharp.  He names names and tells scandalous stories on everyone from Sonny & Cher to Nirvana to the Spice Girls--- especially on himself and his bandmates.  I am not sure if all these stories actually happened, but even the lies have the ring of truth.  This is not a masterpiece, but it's worth looking at.  To quote one of the band's album titles, this book is full of blood, sugar, sex and magic.	2005-03-09

(Chronology, No. 1)	Books	5	123	153	N	Y	A Pretty Wild Theory	This book presents a wildly radical restructuring of the timeline of world history.  It is written by an outsider to the world of historical scholarship: Fomenko is a non-historian (a renowned mathematician) and an non-Westerner (from Russia.)    Fomenko's theory says, basically, that everything we are told about history pre-1600 is BS.  Ancient history is, according to Fomenko, based on evidence quote-unquote \\"discovered\\" since the 15th century and arranged into a spurious standard timeline in the 18th century.  (In some cases, the evidence was discovered much more recently: some Eastern religious texts were only uncovered in the 20th century.)  Fomenko collates this evidence to argue that all those ancient chronicles are different versions of events which really happened roughly between 1000 AD and 1400 AD. The key event in Fomenko's timeline is the life of Christ (who was born in 1053 AD rather than 6BC, Fomenko believes.)  After a relatively short-lived Eurasian empire disintegrated, each nation made up their own version of the empire's history, and generally each new version of the story was set farther back into the past than the previous one.  (The newest version is the Hindu Krishna myth which is set about 10,000 years before the present day.)    This is an appealing theory, since it eliminates the various \\"dark ages\\" which blemish the conventional chronology.  On the other hand, this is an appalling theory, since it creates one big dark age extending from the beginning of time till 900 AD or so.    The book is translated from the Russian.  There is no index, and the bibliography is rather annoyingly arranged in the original Russian alphabetical order (so for example, B's and V's are mixed together.)  But the translation is extremely readable, more readable than most historical works originally written in English.    This is the first book in a projected 7-volume set.    The online bookstore entries for this volume rather amusingly show easily history gets mixed up.  The translator is someone named Michael Jagger who is almost certainly not the singer Mick Jagger (whose full name is Michael Phillip Jagger.)  However, some online bookstores do list Mick Jagger as a coauthor.  Amazon.com says the translator is someone named Mike Jagupov.  This is hard enough to keep straight while the singer is still alive, and a few decades from now, I am sure that many sources will say that the legendary Rolling Stones frontman translated this book into English.    (I have no idea if Mick Jagger speaks Russian or not.  Although he is an educated man--- an alumnus of the University of London--- one would assume that he doesn't.  Certainly, in all the millions of words which have been written about him, no one has commented on his knowledge of the Russian language.  And, if he actually was the person who translated this controversial text into English, the book's publishers would presumably be aggressively advertising that fact.)	2005-02-22

Officially, it has been replaced by Book Five of the 17 Companions of the True Dawn Horse: \\"The Divine Siddha-Method Of The Ruchira Avatar\\".  Sadly, that book has not yet been published, even though some of the other volumes in the Companions series came out as early as the late 1990s. <br /> <br />Some of the essays in this book have been revised and have been published in other \\"Source Text\\" books.  For example, \\"Money, Food and Sex\\" appears in \\"He-and-She Is Me.\\"  Others are available only in this massmarket paperback.  And a very powerful little book this is: the entire history of mankind and the universe are covered clearly and simply in a little more than 500 pages. It is probably still one of the best single-volume introductions to the Adi Da's work, especially if you're a left-brained linear-thinking type of person.  <br /> <br />For five bucks or so, you can take advantage of an infinite amount of wisdom.  This is one of the greatest bargains of all time.   <br /> <br />Some of the Marketplace copies listed here are actually the 1973 or 1992 trade paperback editions.  The earlier one came out very early in the Adi Da's teaching period, so obviously it's missing a significant amount of newer material. The 1992 edition is only slightly different from the 1995 edition. <br />	2005-01-12

The hard-boiled action incongruously takes place in the rather peaceful college town of Missoula, Montana.  Like all other towns, there is a lot of nasty business going on here, however, almost but not quite out of sight.

It was a very timely book at that tragic point in time. <br /> <br />Basically, this is a wide-ranging and fast-moving overview about how catastrophes and cataclysms shape our world, our universe, and our culture, starting with the Big Bang.  The author seamlessly weaves together every academic discipline from quantum physics to Mayan archaeology.  Antony Milne doesn't go into a great deal of depth in any particular area but this is a solidly thought-provoking work.  It's also a humbling book, since it shows that not just the human race but our whole universe will not last forever. <br /> <br />I am surprised this book has only been released as an expensive academic hardcover: a popular trade paperback edition would probably reach a wide audience. <br /> <br />	2004-12-31

I happened to be reading this on the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attacks; on the same day my local paper carried a Mallard Fillmore strip which tried to mock the liberal media by having a stereotypical liberal media commentator intoning, \\"Today the Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor.  Let's examine how we brought this on ourselves.\\"  Amongst many other topics, Chomsky actually does show how we brought Pearl Harbor on ourselves.  The \\"Pacific War\\" as he calls it was not just an unprovoked act of aggression.  The Japanese imperialists, even though (as Chomsky points out) they were every bit as brutal as their white rivals, had an arguably legitimate political goal: that is, they wanted Asia to be ruled by Asians rather than by Europeans.    As others have noted, this is a pwerful, angry and wide-ranging book.  As you can see just from the title: \\"Year 501\\" refers to the 501st anniversary of Columbus's first voyage, but Chomsky's story ranges all over the globe abd all over history.    If you're like me, you know Chomsky's political works primarily from his extensive collaborations with David Barsamian, which are based on speeches and radio interviews.  Chomsky voice is much more fiery when, as he is here, he speaks without Barsamian as a moderator.	2004-12-10

Both this book and \\"Come As You Are\\" gain a lot from the fact that Azerrad is himself a post-punk-rocker (currently and most notably with the band King Of France): he has an insiders' sympathy and objectivity which is lacking from most music journalism.  Not only that, he has a knack for showing how the practical, personal and artistic sides of the musicians' life interact. <br /> <br />One minor complaint about this book is that its design is stodgy, with only a few random band photos included by way of decoration.

So this book has lots of (probably) useful info--- but in our case we will usually be having sex with heterosexual women.<br />At one point, Ms Newman states that a lesbian's \\"experience of the feminine bears little resemblance to that of a heterosexual woman.\\"  If this book is accurate (and it feels accurate), lesbians have sex for the same reason men do--- because it is one of life's basic pleasures.  But for heterosexuals, sex is mixed up with all sorts of gender-politics issues which are (understandably) given minimal attention in this book. In our society and most others, hetero women think of sex primarily as something the man does to you, and not as something you yourself are actively doing---- and you're not supposed to let him do it to you merely because you enjoy it.  You're supposed to save it as a reward for good behavior on his part.<br />But, in any case, there are many great ideas for making all forms of sex more enjoyable and more emotionally rewarding, regardless of the genders or sexual politics of the parties involved.<br />It would be great if a companion volume for heterosexuals could come out someday.	2003-11-16

I thought it would be useful for me to read it since I might like to find a wife at some point (although right now, as of October 2003, I am getting over some stuff and am not ready to get married right away.)  And I thought it would be useful to see if anyone is using the tactics in this book on me.<br />I spotted at least three of Ms Greenwald's tactics being used on me, but nothing very exciting. As far as I can tell, no one is plotting to get married to me right now.<br />First, some women do send polite refusals to my online dating emails, as recommended in the book. (Ms Greenwald's reason for actually bothering to respond to emails from unattractive men is to create the possibility of an unsuitable suitor being moved to recommend you to one of his friends who does meet your criteria--- as if any self-respecting man who cares about his friends' happiness would do such a thing!)   <br />Second, my ex did once ask me out to dinner at the last moment (while she was ex, not while she was my partner) at the last moment to test my spontaneity. She came right out and said, &quot;I was testing you to see if you would do something spontaneous.&quot;  (I do not know if she has actually read the book, but her action came right out of its pages. Ms Greenwald recommends testing a man for spontaneity and other qualities throughout the dating process.  Ms Greenwald actually recommends calling the man on Thursday and demanding that he takes you on a romantic trip to a bed and breakfast that very weekend--- even though men hate staying at bed and breakfasts.)  <br />And thirdly I have noticed women waiting for me to make the first move, as recommended in the book (because making the first move would allegedly strike the man as unfeminine.)<br />These are not very positive comments, but I will say that there are some good commonsense ideas in here.  The author's basic message is that a woman has to go out into the world and make her presence known if she wants to find a mate, because that is where her future husband is--- out there in the world.  That is not bad advice, and the basic outlines of her plan are sound--- even though some of the details of her plan give me the creeps, and I would be a little (maybe more than a little) frightened if any woman actually used this plan on me.	2003-10-04

The CD is, as the title implies, an hour-long talk from the \\"Garbage and Goddess\\" period in the spring of 1974, when the Adi Da put his followers through some amazing spiritual and psychosexual experiences.  This talk deals in plain and simple language with many of the highlights of the Adi Da's early career, such as his \\"divine emergence\\" at the Vedanta Temple in Hollywood, and the lessons Rudi taught Beloved Adi Da about throwing garbage away.<br />This text of this discourse is included in the recent book \\"He-and-She Is Me\\" as well as in an older (and hard-to-find) book entitled \\"Garbage and the Goddess.\\"  If you are relatively unfamiliar with the Adi Da's work, this CD might be a better place to start than \\"He-and-She Is Me\\" (a brilliant but largely impenetrable book.)	2003-08-12

(The late Brian Jones was in an early version of the band before Keith and Mick got involved. I had a hard time finishing the book.)<br />I enjoyed reading about the band's 1960's adventures, but once I got past Brian's mysterious death, my interest waned. This was not because the book got more boring at that point; it was just because I already knew the story from being a fan of the band and reading about them in Rolling Stone and similar magazines. (The author wrote many of the magazine stories about the Stones which I enjoyed as a younger person.)  The book does get a lot more boring near the end, because the band's music got a lot less interesting about 20 years ago.  (Somewhere around \\"Tattoo You\\" Mick and Keith pretty much ran out of ideas and since then they have been coasting.)<br />Speaking of boring, one of the more amusing revelations in this book is that Mick is actually a rather boring person offstage. Onstage, he is rock and roll's answer to the Greek god Dionysius, offstage he is a rather quiet London School of Economics alumnus.<br />Davis provides us with an incredibly detailed index: it is fun to look up your favorite song or favorite incident and read about it in the book.	2003-07-07

It is reasonably up-to-date, but it takes a rather quaint view of the hiring process.  It assumes that a typical company has a large and politically powerful human-resources department which has been given vast amounts of time, staff, and resources to engage in a fastidiously objective hiring process.  It also assumes that a company's management actually knows what the firm's future personnel needs are.  Most unrealistically of all, it assumes that HR and line managers actually communicate with one another.  Even in 1968 when Chiron & Fears wrote the first edition of this book, this was a pollyannaish viewpoint.  In 2003, their assumptions add up to a ludicrous fantasy.<br />The heart of the book is a detailed explanation of a methodology for conducting structured hiring interviews.  It also covers yearly perfomance reviews and related topics.  The authors frankly describe how to create an illusory rapport with the interviewee while homing in on the character flaws which might make him or her unfit to hold the job he or she is interviewing for.  The flaws the authors think you should be particularly worried about are laziness and stupidity.<br />It is a useful book for anyone who has to do hiring interviews, even when the company is trying to cut corners in the hiring process.  It is even more useful for the interviewee, because after the reading the book, you have a better idea what the person on the other side of the desk is looking for.  (By the way, the authors tell interviewers to AVOID sitting on the far side of a desk.)  <br />It is worth buying the book just for the discussion of the dreaded \\"strengths and weaknesses\\" question.  You should admit to a weakness while proving you don't really have that weakness.  A good weakness to admit to seems to be \\"I don't work hard enough\\"--- assuming you can convince the interviewer that you are in fact a workaholic.<br />I have taken a sarcastic view of this book's content, but it is well worth reading and contains many excellent suggestions.  Although I personally don't agree with many aspects of Chiron and Fears' methodology, I do think the business world would be a more humane place if more companies used a similar methodology (or just about ANY methodology) to evaluate job applicants.<br />I gave the book a 5th star for actually being readable and entertaining (unlike most management books.)	2003-05-16

Also, Tennyson is (on the surface at least) perhaps the least psychologically introspective poet since Homer.

I wish I had read both of these books earlier!<br />This is a small book, written in a breezy style, with lots of repetition.  As such,  it is not dissimilar to thousands of other self-help books--- but Mundis's  books are special in two ways:  <br />1.  He doesn't BS the reader.<br />2.  he  doesn't condescend the reader.	2000-07-24

More importantly, this book  is a lot of fun to read, thanks to the author's unique sense of humor.	2000-05-02

You know the systems I mean: the ones you access using those ugly old green and black screens in  a dusty corner of your IT department's offices, the ones with the humongous  databases hidden behind arcane text-based software. The potentially dry  material is greatly moistened by DuCharme's witty yet understated writing  style.<br />There are still a lot of those dinosaur mainframes still roaming  the earth, Y2K notwithstanding, so this field guide is still useful, a full  half-decade after it was published.	1999-09-28

And How to Win Them Over!	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	If you have buy just one writer's guide this year...	This is the one to buy.  It covers a lot of topics in a relatively small space (454 pp.), but there's lots of good info here, written in a vastly more engaging style than any of the competing writers' guides (including  Jeff Herman's book which is published by the same company.) The best thing  about this guide is that Press takes thr writer's side: he does not  hesitate to say what he really thinks (right or wrong) about the various  agencies, producers, etc., and he refuses to let any agencies, production  companies, etc. opt out of the book.  Also, he includes detailed lists of  personnel at the agencies, production companies, etc.  Not perfectfar from  flawless, but well worth your $18.40.	1999-07-12

It has the same strengths and same weaknesses as the 1998 and earlier editions of this same work.  Aside from the usual additions and subtractions in the  listing pages, the only major difference from last year's book is the new  introductory articles.  Most of these articles are reprints from previous  issues of Writers Digest magazine, but they're generally well worth  reading.  (Of course, this book is kinda like Playboy Magazine in that no  one buys it for the articles, excellent though they may be in some  cases.)<br />The listings are useful, but incomplete.  Many important agencies  have been left out for one reason or another.  <br />Happily, fee-charging  agencies are strictly segregated from the non-fee-charging agencies (which  are the only ones you want to do business with.)  Even if you are foolish  enough to go with a fee-charging agency, you can at least assume that the  agencies in this book do occasionally actually sell books to  publishers.<br />(I might add that the editor of the 1999 edition, Donya  Dickerson, is my second cousin's ex-wife.  I've never even met the woman,  and the generally positive nature of my review is not due to this rather  attenuated family tie.)	1999-02-04

It consists of short, just the facts ma'am, listings with all the basic data, e.g., name, address, name of the contact  person(s), listing of recent sales, whether or not you'll get hit up for a  fee, etc.  This book's big weakness is, not surprisingly, that its  compilers take the agents' side rather than the writers' side, which means  that the info tends to be very bland.  Another big weakness is that many  prominent agencies (e.g., The Wylie Agency, the Endeavor Agency, and a  number of others) are not listed at all, because they asked to be left out,  in order to minimize the number of incoming submissions.	1998-11-08
