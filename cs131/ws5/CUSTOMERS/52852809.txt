This is a review of What the Best College Teachers Do by Ken Bain.<br /><br /> Bain, the director of the Center for Teaching Excellence at NYU, did a study of outstanding college-level teachers. For example, the students of calculus teacher Dan Saari of UC Irvine obtain a disproportionately large percentage of the A's on their school's college-wide calculus final.  The medical students of cell biologist Jeanette Norden of Vanderbilt do far better than the national average on their board exams.  In other cases, the success is in principle less clearly demonstrable.  (How would one \\"prove\\" that a philosophy or English professor taught exceptionally well?)  But Bain and his colleagues were particularly interested in professors whose students said changed the way they think, and sparked a lifelong interest in the subject.<br /><br /> Bain wanted to find out what such outstanding teachers had in common.  The basic lesson he arrived at is easy to formulate (although challenging to implement).  Mediocre and bad teachers typically subscribe to a \\"transmission model\\" of education, in which teaching is a matter of transmitting knowledge from the professor's brain to the students' brains.  Outstanding teachers, in contrast, assume a \\"learning model\\" of education. The teacher who subscribes to a learning model is constantly searching to find what her students need to learn, constantly adjusts to meet those needs, and always responds to students' failures with efforts to teach better.<br /><br /> This might seem like an obvious point, but it is not.  Speaking as someone who has been teaching for about twenty years, it is very easy to get into the mindset that says, \\"I put the knowledge out there.  It's the students' job to pick it up.\\"  I have not myself fallen into that mindset (not most of the time, anyway), but many teachers do.<br /><br /> A further conclusion of the book is that the attitude of the professor is far more important than any other aspect of teaching.  Pedagogic styles vary greatly among outstanding professors.  Some lecture, others do not.  (Interestingly, none lectures exclusively.)  Some have outgoing personalities, some are shy.  Some argue with their students, others are more collegial.  (Significantly, no outstanding teachers humiliate their students or make them afraid to argue.  It follows from this study that someone like \\"Professor Kingsfield\\" of the Paper Chase is the very worst kind of teacher.)  Outstanding teachers have a style that goes beyond simple technique, but is not (for that reason) unlearnable.  In particular, outstanding teachers are extremely knowledgeable about their subject, but at the same time they manifest humility (that they do  not know everything themselves, and that their teaching can always improve), respect (for their students as humans, whom they never humiliate), faith (that their students can learn if given the right opportunity), and trust (that their students will make an honest effort, given the right environment).<br /><br />The difficulties of achieving real learning are vividly illustrated by a study conducted by two physicists who tested students at the beginning of introductory physics courses on their understanding of the motion of physical bodies.  Unsurprisingly, the students \\"entered the course with an elementary, intuitive theory about the physical world, what the physicists called 'a cross between Aristotelian and 14th-century impetus ideas'\\" (22).  After the students had completed the course, they tested them again.  Surprisingly, most students had exactly the same ideas about motion that they had entered the course with, including a number of students who got A's.  Wait, it gets worse!  The physicists conducted interviews with some of the students, and performed experiments in front of them demonstrating that their views were mistaken.  \\"What they heard astonished them:  many of the students still refused to give up their mistaken ideas about motion\\" (23).  Part of what this illustrates is that professors need to develop an awareness of what mental models the students bring to the course and of how these models may interfere with learning.  Then the teachers have to devise methods for encouraging the students to dismantle these models for themselves, and get better ones.<br /><br /> Of course, some students face additional challenges.  In one experiment, two otherwise comparable groups of African-American students were given a portion of the Graduate Record Examination.  One group was told that it tested their ability, while the other group was told that it was a \\"laboratory task that was used to study how certain problems are generally solved\\" (70).  The former students performed significantly less well.  Apparently, stereotyping produces performance anxiety that can adversely affect students.  Even more stunning (I thought), in another study, three groups of Asian American women were given the same math test.  Prior to the test, one group was given a questionnaire that included a question identifying their race, one group had a questionnaire that included a question identifying their gender, and the third group's questionnaire mentioned neither.  The group with the racial question performed the best (responding apparently to the reverse stereotype that Asians are good at math), and the group with the gender question performed the worst (responding to the stereotype that women are worse at math).<br /><br /> What kind of learning are we trying to promote in our students? One group of psychologists has identified four levels of understanding that students can go through.  (1) \\"Received knowers\\" are students who expect there to be definitive answers that they can regurgitate on tests or in papers, ideally word-for-word.  Received knowers may eventually become aware of the fact that, in many areas, there are no simple right or wrong answers.  They then typically graduate to being (2) \\"subjective knowers.\\"  Subjective knowers regard everything as simply a matter of opinion.  If they get a low grade, their initial reaction is that it represents nothing but the professor's subjective (and annoyingly punitive) personal opinion.  (3) \\"Procedural knowers\\" are the students who have learned to \\"play the game.\\"  They have learned that there are standards internal to intellectual disciplines, and they have learned to meet those standards.  But for procedural knowers, it's still just a game.  Like the students in the physics class who get an A but continue to think the same way about motion, procedural knowers never really internalize the standards.  (4)  Those who do internalize the standards of the discipline have achieved \\"commitment.\\"  But commitment is not just mindless acceptance of the standards.  The student who is committed thinks deeply and critically about those standards.  Within the level of commitment, the study distinguished between \\"separate knowers,\\" who like to remain skeptical and critical, and \\"connected knowers,\\" who try to understand other views sympathetically and synthetically.  (Interestingly, more women than men seem to prefer being connected knowers.  This implies that different techniques may be needed to guide male and female students to the fourth level, and that they may manifest having achieved this level in different ways.)<br /><br /> How can we achieve these goals?  Empirical testing shows that extrinsic rewards for behavior that are seen as manipulative tend to decrease long-term interest in an activity, whereas intrinsic rewards (finding something interesting in itself) and positive verbal reinforcement stimulate and maintain interest.  This applies to grading as a motivator as well.  Students motivated by grades learn less effectively and have less long-term interest in the subject than those motivated either by the intrinsic interest of the topic or praise.<br /><br /> Students generally seem to respond best to being given high standards, along with assurances that they can meet them.  Indeed, it turns out that students who are \\"at risk\\" in science courses actually do significantly better if they are invited into honors courses, rather than being put into remedial classes.  This counterintuitive approach apparently works because it signals to students just that combination of high standards and confidence in the student's abilities.<br /><br /> In the chapter on how outstanding teacher conduct classes, Bain identifies the five elements of what he calls a \\"natural critical learning environment\\":  (1) start with some question that students will find intriguing, (2) help the students to see why this question is important, (3) encourage the students to think actively and critically, rather than just listening and remembering, (4) guide the students to working out an answer, and (5) leave the student with further questions.  Some of us have done this intuitively, but even so it is helpful to have the steps laid out explicitly.  Although he stresses that good teaching is more than techniques, Bain also provides some helpful tips in this chapter.  One should call on shy students the way one \\"might do so around the dinner table rather than the way they might cross-exam them in a courtroom\\" (131).  When lecturing, use techniques like dramatic pauses, and change one's pace every ten or so minutes. Invite students rather than commanding them:  for example, begin the semester asking for a show of hands of who is willing to show up, be on time and intellectually participate in every class.<br /><br /> Scattered throughout the book are a number of other interesting facts.  Like many teachers, I have been very skeptical of whether student evaluations are anything other than a popularity contest.  (This is not sour grapes:  I have more than once received \\"perfect\\"  ratings from an entire class of students.)  However, it turns out that there is empirical evidence that two evaluation questions do correlate with independent measures of student learning:  \\"Did the professor help you learn?\\" and \\"Did the professor stimulate your interest in the subject?\\"  (13)  On the other hand, a 1993 study showed that student evaluations of teachers based on video clips of a few seconds in length were substantially the same as those they would give after a semester.  Bain charitably concludes that students  have simply gotten very good at accurately determining who will or will not turn out to be a good teacher.  Well, perhaps.  But if my snap judgments of students at the beginning of the semester generally correlated with the final grades I assigned them, would you assume I was an insightful teacher, or a superficial and dogmatic one?<br /><br /> Although it occasionally succumbs to vague rhetoric, this book is overall a very useful guide to some of what we know about good college pedagogy.jective knowers regard everything as simply a matter of opinion.

(The same translation by John Nathan is published by both Tuttle Publishing and Vintage Books.)<br /><br />Mishima was a controversial twentieth-century Japanese novelist, famous both for his disturbing fiction as well as for his death by ritual suicide.  These is no consensus about what his single best work is, but this novella a good place to start.<br /><br />The main character is Noboru Kuroda, a thirteen-year-old boy who lives with his widowed mother, Fusako.  Noboru discovers a hole in the wall behind a chest of drawers which allows him to peep into his mother's bedroom.  He watches her undress, look at herself in the mirror, and even masturbate.  Noboru is a bright, intense boy, and belongs to a group of five other boys, led by \\"the chief.\\"  The chief succinctly expresses the group's existential philosophy:  \\"All six of us are geniuses.  And the world, as you know, is empty\\" (161).  The \\"geniuses\\" are looking for something that will fill this emptiness, \\"in much the same way that a crack along its face will fill a mirror\\" (57).<br /><br />Noboru is fascinated with the sea and ships, so his mother arranges for a tour of a merchant vessel in the port.  The First Mate is Ryuji Tsukazaki.  Ryuji, too, has been looking for something meaningful in his life, and went to the sea to find it.  Fusako invites Ryuji out to dinner, and then later discreetly brings him to her bedroom.  But Noboru is watching again.  At first, Noboru admires Ryuji.  He seems heroic for his rejection of conventional society (symbolized by his turning toward the sea [12, 179]) and his quest for glory (represented by his constant journeys on the ocean). But Ryuji abandons the life of the sea to marry Fusako, and become another ordinary land-dweller.  Noboru must do something desperate to avenge this betrayal.  (And I cannot say more than that without spoiling the story for you.)<br /><br />An engaging tale.  But what is it really about?  It strikes me as a very \\"male\\" novel.  Although told in a stark and extreme form, the issues Noboru and Ryuji wrestle with are issues all men face.  Young men wish to do something \\"glorious\\" with their lives.  They struggle at it for a few years, knowing that they are not making much progress, but believing that their time will come.  But then come the responsibilities of a wife and child.  At that point, like Ryuji, other men often decide, \\"[i]t was time to abandon the dream he had cherished too long.  Time to realize that no specially tailored glory was waiting for him\\" (110).<br /><br />Sons, like Noboru, begin by idolizing their fathers.  But then they realize that their fathers are really just ordinary men, men who have compromised their ideals, and given up their dreams.  Some sons come to despise their fathers for it, vowing never to become what their fathers have.<br /><br />The Freudian themes in the story are obvious, of course.  The \\"chief\\" explains that fathers are \\"filthy, lecherous flies broadcasting to the whole world that they've screwed with our mothers\\" (138).  Although Noboru expresses no direct sexual desire for his mother, he is clearly fascinated by her sexuality.  His own father is dead, and Ryuji becomes, at first, the perfect \\"fantasy father.\\"  Noboru brags to his friends that Ryuji is \\"different.  He's really going to do something.\\" When pressed for details of what, he replies, \\"I can't say exactly, but it'll be something...terrific\\" (50, ellipsis in original).  But Ryuji betrays the fantasy.  He turns out to be more ordinary in his views and even style of life than Noboru hoped.  And worst of all he stays to become Noboru's actual father.  Fathers, in the Oedipal fantasy, must be either perfect and absent or dead.<br /><br />Is there a lesson to be drawn from all this?  Yes, but the lesson depends on one's general philosophical perspective.  A Nietzschean existentialist would draw the conclusion that the \\"chief\\" and the other boys are right.  There is something sad, almost pathetic, in the conventionality that Ryuji succumbs to.  In deciding how to treat his new \\"son,\\" Ryuji comforts himself with the observation, \\"[m]ost books and magazines would agree\\" (171) with what he is doing.  On the other hand, a Confucian would trace the emptiness of the boys' lives to the lack of parental affection and guidance.  One of the boys says of his father, \\"[h]e slaps me across the face.  Sometimes he even punches\\" (138).  The world seems empty to those denied the love of others, a Confucian would say.<br /><br />The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea is a story so extreme that it becomes almost mythical.  But like any myth it reflects things deep in ourselves and in human existence that we cannot see in an ordinary story.that the \\"chief\\" and the other boys are right.

This is a review of The Carnal Prayer Mat by the seventeenth-century Chinese author Li Yu, in the translation by Patrick Hanan.  (In Chinese, family names are written first, so the author's surname is \\"Li.\\")<br /><br />This book is a classic that is sexy, witty, fast-paced and fun to read even if you don't like \\"classics.\\"  It also has interesting philosophical aspects that raise it above the level of simply an entertaining read.  Some of these philosophical points are raised in the \\"Critique\\" sections that come at the end of every chapter (probably written by a friend of Li Yu's).  You should be warned that this IS an erotic novel.  It is not any more graphic than lots of popular novels today, but if you are offended by explicit sexual discussions, you should not read it.<br /><br />The novel's main character is Vesperus, an extremely talented scholar who has two ambitions in life: \\"to be the most brilliant poet in the world\\" and \\"to marry the most beautiful girl in the world\\" (p. 24). Vesperus is warned by the Buddhist monk Lone Peak that this second quest will lead him to numerous wicked acts.  Because he wants only the most beautiful woman, he will never be satisfied with any woman he marries, and will even commit adultery with other married women if they seem more beautiful to him.  And because of the law of karmic retribution, Vesperus will be punished, either in this life or the next, for his evil deeds.  Vesperus scoffs at this admonition, so Lone Peak advises, \\"gain your enlightenment on the carnal prayer mat; then you'll discover the truth\\" (p. 30).<br /><br />What makes this novel so philosophically interesting is that we're never sure quite what perspective the novel takes on all this.  At a surface level, the novel is a straightforward moral tale.  In an introductory chapter, Li Yu tells us that he wants to teach people that a moderate amount of sex within marriage is good, but that excessive sex or sex outside of marriage is dangerous.  He claims that his explicit sexual descriptions \\"are all designed to lure people into reading on until they reach the denouement, at which point they will understand the meaning of retribution and take heed\\" (p. 11).  And, indeed, the life of Vesperus does follow a path that suggests such a message.<br /><br />However, there is much in the text that is potentially subversive.  For example, Vesperus learns, to his surprise, that he is very poorly endowed compared to most men.  Li Yu describes this as an opportunity for him to curb his inappropriate lust, comparing him to two Confucian sages noted for their sexual restraint:  \\"Who knows, perhaps Lu Nanzi, who shut his door against an importunate widow, and Liuxia Hui, who kept his self-control with a girl on his knee, may have shared these very thoughts of his, thoughts that may have made them the leading paragons of all time\\" (pp. 105-106).  Chinese thinkers were sophisticated enough to realize that virtue requires appropriate motivation, and that fear of sexual inadequacy is not a virtuous motivation for sexual restraint.<br /><br />In addition, Li Yu advises us, \\"Clearly it is wrong to study the bedroom art, for once learned, it tends to corrupt our thinking\\" (p. 117).  But this novel itself is, in part, a treatise on \\"the bedroom art.\\" There are learned disquisitions on the proper use of pillows in positioning a woman's body (p. 151 ff.), on the advantages of plumper women over skinnier ones in bed (p. 253 ff.), and on the importance of women taking an active role during intercourse, as by \\"Lowering the Yin to Join the Yang\\" (i.e., female superior position; p. 280 ff.).<br /><br />The novel also makes extensive plays on the Confucian classics in ways that sometimes suggest subversive irreverence.  Many of these references are to the ancient Confucian Mengzi (also known as Mencius).  In fact, Li Yu explicitly compares himself to Mencius (pp. 9-11), who avoided taking an overly puritanical tone with a ruler fond of sex, in order to more successfully direct him toward benevolent government.  (See Philip J. Ivanhoe and Bryan W. Van Norden, eds. Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy, reprint [Indianapolis:  Hackett Publishing, 2003], p. 120.) The learned translator, Patrick Hanan, catches many such references, but I suspect that he misses a few. For instance, Vesperus's wife reads some erotic novels, and notices that the men in the stories are described as being much better endowed than her husband.  She is not sure what to make of this, since she has never been with another man.  She concludes, \\"Better to have no books at all then to believe everything you read\\" (p. 207).  Hanan puts this in quotation marks, so he recognizes that it is a quotation from something.  In fact, it is probably from Mencius 7B3, in which he comments on the Book of History.  Drawing this parallel hints that the Confucian classic, the Book of History, is on a level ethically and intellectually with popular erotica (such as The Carnal Prayer Mat itself).<br /><br />But a simple subversive reading seems inadequate too.  The eventual downfall of Vesperus and those whom he entangles in his web is artfully complex, but it does not seem contrived or implausible.  In a truly great novel, the author does not try to force the characters to illustrate any particular moral.  He creates them and lets them do what they must do, given who they are and the situations they are in.  Great novels are ethically complex because life is ethically complex.  The Carnal Prayer Mat achieves this kind of greatness, but for that reason it defies easy ethical summation.of sex, in order to more successfully direct him toward benevolent government.

This is a review of _Chinese Characters:  A Genealogy and Dictionary_ by Rick Harbaugh.<br />This is an excellent book for helping students to (1) learn and memorize Chinese characters, and (2) identify characters that are difficult to find in traditional dictionaries.  However, as Harbaugh himself makes clear, it is important not to confuse this learning tool with a scholarly guide to the actual etymologies of Chinese characters.<br />In order to understand what is distinctive and especially useful about this dictionary, you need to know a little about how Chinese characters are composed.  (If you already know this, or are not interested, skip to the next paragraph in this review.)  Traditionally, there are five types of Chinese characters.  The simplest characters are either pictograms (which were originally pictures of something concrete) or simple ideograms (whose structure suggests their meaning, even though they are not pictures).  So, for example, the character for \\"person\\" was originally a drawing of a person, and the character for the number three is three horizontal lines.  Many people assume that all Chinese characters fall into these two classes, but in fact only a small percentage do.  Most Chinese characters are semantic-phonetic compounds, in which part of the character gives a hint about the sound, and another part gives a hint about the meaning.  The last two types of characters are compound ideograms (in which two characters are compounded into one, and their individual meanings contribute to the meaning of the whole) and phonetic loans (in which a pre-existing character is borrowed to represent a word whose sound is similar to that of the word the character originally represented).  Now, traditional dictionaries are organized according to over 200 so-called \\"radicals.\\" Every character in Chinese has at least one radical in it somewhere.  So if you want to identify a Chinese character you haven't seen before (or can't remember), you take an educated guess at what the radical in it is, then look for it under that radical in the dictionary.  However, one problem is that the radicals of some characters are not obvious.<br />What Harbaugh has done is to organize his dictionary around 182 pictograms and simple ideograms.  (Many of these overlap with the traditional radicals, but others do not.)  Then he shows (using extensive \\"genealogical\\" charts) how about 4000 other characters are built up from the original 182 by adding more components.  Part of what makes this book really useful is that Harbaugh builds the charts in a way that highlights the phonetic components of characters.  For example, his basic character 175 is identified as a \\"pictograph of [the] interlocking framework of a house.\\"  This character is pronounced GOU, and underneath it in Harbaugh's dictionary you will find four characters with very similar pronunciations (and one with a different pronunciation) that include that character as a component.  In contrast, in a traditional dictionary, the original GOU is not a radical at all.  Furthermore, in a traditional dictionary, EACH of the similarly-pronounced characters would be found under a different radical.  Consequently, Harbaugh's dictionary takes a lot of the mystery out of character composition and recognition.  Harbaugh also gives you mnemonics for each character.  For instance, the first character under GOU means \\"to construct.\\"  It has the wood radical on the left, so Harbaugh suggests you remember it by thinking of a \\"wooden framework.\\"<br />Each character entry provides a wealth of additional information:  the simplified form of the character (used in Mainland China), an identification of the components of the simplified form, the meanings of the character (and their parts of speech), a list of common expressions in which the character is the SECOND component (with an index number to help you find the first character in the expression), and then a list of common words in which the character is the first component (along with their pronunciations, in Pinyin, part of speech, and meanings).<br />Harbaugh has done almost everything imaginable to make this dictionary reader-friendly.  Suppose you see one of Harbaugh's components in a character, and look for it there in his dictionary.  Some characters have more than one component in them, so Harbaugh may not have put the primary entry for a character where you are looking for it.  However, Harbaugh provides cross-references, so you can find a character under ANY of its components.  Finally, this dictionary has a number of indexes:  an index to expressions by their English translations, a Pinyin (pronunciation) index to characters and expressions, a \\"Mandarin Phonetic\\" (Bopomofo) index to characters and expressions, a total stroke number index to characters, and a traditional radical index to characters.<br />The only concern I have with this fine dictionary is that an incautious student (or scholar) might innocently confuse it with an actual etymological dictionary.

Suppose you see one of Harbaugh's components in a character, and look for it there in his dictionary.  Some characters have more than one component in them, so Harbaugh may not have put the primary entry for a character where you are looking for it.  However, Harbaugh provides cross-references, so you can find a character under ANY of its components.  Finally, this dictionary has a number of indexes:  an index to expressions by their English translations, a Pinyin (pronunciation) index to characters and expressions, a \\"Mandarin Phonetic\\" (Bopomofo) index to characters and expressions, a total stroke number index to characters, and a traditional radical index to characters.<br />The only concern I have with this fine dictionary is that an incautious student (or scholar) might innocently confuse it with an actual etymological dictionary.

And I remember that I liked them. But that's almost all I remember. So, when we were given this book as a present for our two children, I didn't know what to expect.<br />I am now in awe of what a wonderful series of stories this is. There are seven stories, published over a series of twenty-five years. By modern publishing standards, that's not a lot of books for a successful series. There's a reason for that: Margaret and H.A. Rey took their time to craft fine stories.<br />These are stories that are written in a simple, comprehensible way, so my kids have been enjoying them since they were three years old. However, the stories are not \\"dumbed down\\" for children. The plots are interesting, with twists and turns. In \\"Curious George Gets a Medal,\\" George goes from thinking about writing letters, to trying to clean up some spilled ink, to trying to find a pump to clean up some water, to trying to find an animal to drag a pump, to a museum, where he meets the person who had written the letter that started him on his quest (!), to a rocket ride. This description cannot do justice to the natural flow the incidents have in the context of the story.<br />The illustrations are in a bright, charming, and in what is (now) an immediately recognizable style. Unlike so many children's books, it is obvious that great care has been put into the illustrations. In one picture, George is shown floating over the city, carried aloft by some balloons he had taken. He is the focus, of course, but if we look carefully, we see on the ground the balloon-man, from whom George had taken the balloons (running after George below), the brother and sister who were buying a balloon from him when George took the other balloons, the man with the yellow hat (driving in the same blue car with a tire on the back that will reappear on the next page), and a couple of men who have obviously walked into each other and fallen down because they were looking up in the air at George. Priceless!<br />The only entry in this collection that is not up to the general high standard is \\"Curious George Learns the Alphabet.\\" This is really not a story at all, but an introduction to the letters, showing how each resembles something that starts with that letter. It's fine for what it is, but it pales in comparison with the rich stories around it.<br />You can really appreciate how outstanding these stories are when you compare them to contemporary efforts to continue the series, like \\"Curious George and the Dumptruck\\" (published, thank goodness, separately). This story has none of the sparkle of the authentic, original Curious George.<br />In this era of political correctness, some parents, librarians and teachers may be concerned about certain aspects of some stories. George smokes a pipe before bed in one; in another he opens a bottle of ether, sniffs it, and goes into a woozy state before passing out. George also lives in a world in which there seem to be almost no people of color.<br />So supplement your children's reading of Curious George with other books that reflect the diversity of the world, and add your own little glosses to parts of the book that show behavior that concerns you (\\"Oh, George shouldn't open a medicine bottle should he? You wouldn't do that, would you?\\"). But do read to your children, and encourage them to read, Curious George.eappear on the next page), and a couple of men who have obviously walked into each other and fallen down because they were looking up in the air at George.

US	52852809	RU7C7HVRBAR1	0198154607	135779674	A New Introduction to Classical Chinese	Books	3	41	46	N	Y	A difficult textbook for a difficult language	This is a review of _A New Introduction to Classical Chinese_ by Raymond Dawson (which is an update of his earlier _An Introduction to Classical Chinese_).<br />Roughly speaking, Classical Chinese is to modern Chinese as Latin is to Italian.  Classical Chinese was, for millennia, the language that was read and written by intellectuals in not only China, but also Korea, Japan and Vietnam.  Of course, there is variation in the styles of Classical Chinese.  Dawson focuses on specimens of Chinese from the Warring States Period (403-221 BC, with many samples from the Confucian sage Mencius), plus a few pieces from the Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian (who lived around 100 BC).  These are fine choices, reflecting authors and periods later regarded as paradigms of style.<br />I think the best way to describe this book is to explain how a student would use it.  First, it would be much easier to use this book if you have previous experience with Chinese characters (as by taking a year or two of modern Chinese or Japanese).  However, it is *possible* to use the book without previous background.<br />The student should begin with Dawson's Introduction (pp. 1-9).  Some of the material here really belongs in a Preface (such as information on how this book differs from the earlier edition -- the student doesn't need to know this), but what will prove helpful is the advice on how to find the \\"radicals\\" in Chinese characters, and how to count the remaining \\"strokes.\\"  (The \\"radicals\\" are a set of 214 characters, at least one of which occurs in each Chinese character.  I'll explain in a moment why this section is so important for this textbook.)  The Introduction also has a cursory discussion of grammar, and a pronunciation chart.<br />The student then proceeds to the Chinese texts, which are laid out in traditional format, written in lines from top to bottom, and then right to left.  This is cute, but it is intimidating to the beginner, I think, to be confronted with twenty uninterrupted pages of Chinese text.<br />What does one do next?  The Chinese text *is* divided into separate readings (marked with Roman letters at the tops of the pages).  For the first passage (and ONLY for the first passage), there is a chart listing the characters in their order of first appearance, and identifying the radical of each character.  To find the meaning for a character in the text, the student finds it in the chart, notes the number of the radical, then goes to the general glossary at the end of the book, looks up that radical, then finds the particular character he is looking for (which will be accompanied by the Pinyin and Wade-Giles romanizations of its Mandarin pronunciations, its grammatical class or classes, and its meanings).  Characters with the same radical are subdivided according to how many additional \\"strokes\\" beyond the radical they are written with.<br />No chart for finding the radicals of new characters is provided after the first passage, so from then on in the student must find them for herself.  (A chart of the radicals themselves, helpfully including their abbreviated forms, is provided on pp. 115-118.)<br />Now, this may seem utterly perverse.  Why not just give the poor students vocabulary lists after each reading?  I *think* Dawson's belief was that students need to learn as soon as possible how to find characters for themselves using a standard Chinese dictionary.  And a standard Chinese dictionary organizes its characters by radicals + additional strokes.  This is a laudable goal, but I worry that it is far too much to expect students -- even ones who have previous familiarity with characters -- to wrestle with a new grammar, and a new lexicon, and new semantics AND spend literally hours trying to look up new characters.  Dictionary skills are something students should hone in an advanced Classical Chinese reading course, not in their introductory class.<br />Dawson does provide grammatical notes for each passage.  But these are sometimes problematic.  For example, in the very first passage, the Confucian philosopher Mencius says to a king, \\"Why must Your Majesty speak of profit?  Let there simply be benevolence and righteousness.\\"  Dawson claims that Mencius is quoting a phrase the king had used a moment before, and translates the line as \\"Why must Your Majesty mention profit?  I 'surely possess' humanity and justice and nothing more.\\"  Leaving aside the questionable use of \\"justice\\" as a translation (this word is more appropriate in modern Western political theory than in Mencius's discussion of human virtues), Dawson is led to his dubious reading because he fails to see that YI4...ER2 YI3 YI3 is a sentence-pattern in Classical Chinese, meaning \\"... absolutely all there is.\\"  Consequently, the YOU3 is not part of a paraphrase of what the king had just said, and it does not mean (in this context) \\"to have,\\" but means \\"let there be.\\"  What sense would it make anyway for Mencius to say that he \\"possesses\\" benevolence and righteousness?  It seems the very antithesis of Confucian humility to begin an audience with a king with such a declaration.<br />(For another problem with Dawson's handling of this passage, see \\"On Translating Mencius,\\" by David S. Nivison, originally published in 1980 and reprinted in his _The Ways of Confucianism_.)<br />Dawson's book also includes two \\"Grammatical Surveys,\\" which provide reviews after the fifth and seventeenth readings, complete translations of the first five readings, and a \\"List of Characters Having Obscure Radicals.\\"<br />All in all, given its intimidating pedagogic approach and simple errors of fact, I have trouble recommending this textbook.

US	52852809	R2BXBY9HETP7K5	0268019444	966544913	Whose Justice? Which Rationality?	Books	5	96	99	N	N	A major work of contemporary philosophy	This is a review of _Whose Justice? Which Rationality?_ by Alasdair MacIntyre.<br />This is a very challenging book to read, but also one that will deepen your thinking about the world, whether you agree with it or not.<br />We largely take it for granted that (1) people disagree significantly about a wide range of issues related to ethics, and that (2) people do not agree about enough standards of rationality to resolve these ethical disagreements.  MacIntyre puts this by saying that &quot;logical incompatibility and incommensurability&quot; both obtain (p. 351).  What conclusion should we draw from these facts?  One common response is relativism, which is roughly the view that the truth or falsity of a claim depends on the perspective from which it is evaluated.  However, MacIntyre argues against relativism based on a brilliant reinterpretation of several major Western philosophical traditions.<br />The Western Englightenment (of which Descartes is paradigmatic), rejected appeals to tradition, canonical texts and authority, and attempted to put in their place the &quot;appeal to principles undeniable by any rational person,&quot; and hence independent of culture, history, etc.  &quot;Yet both the thinkers of the Enlightenment and their successors proved unable to agree as to what precisely those principles were which could be found undeniable by all rational persons&quot; (p. 6).  Since the Enlightenment, most Western thinkers have either (1) continued to search for principles that are universally acceptable to all minimally rational humans (and continued to fail in this quest), or (2) given up on the quest for universal principles of reason, but -- paradoxically -- continued to assume the Enlightenment prejudice that any rational justification would have to be universal, ahistorical, and acultural.<br />MacIntyre suggests that neither approach has learned the lesson of the failure of the Enlightenment project, which is that any rational justification has to be parochial, historical and in a particular cultural context.<br />Since rational justification must be historical, the bearers of justification are not &quot;theories&quot; in the abstract, but embodied traditions.  MacIntyre examines four sample traditions in this book (although he admits there are many more):  the Aristotelian-Thomistic, the Augustinean, and those of the &quot;Scottish Enlightenment&quot; and modern liberalism.<br />Traditions like these can undergo &quot;epistemological crises&quot;:  situations in which a tradition, by its own standards, increasingly discloses &quot;new inadequacies, hitherto unrecognized incoherences, and new problems for the solution of which there seem to be insufficient or no resources within the established fabric of belief&quot; (p. 362).  A tradition may find a way to survive such a crisis (as Thomas Aquinas helped Christianity to do by synthesizing Augustineanism and Aristotelianism), but it may also fail.  And because the possibility of failure is there, relativism is false:  a tradition can come to see that its claims are false even by its own standards.<br />Even if my tradition is not in an obvious crisis, I can realize that I have a rational justification for rejecting or modifying it.  Suppose I am confronted with an alien intellectual tradition which is both incompatible and incommensurable with my own.  Because the two are incompatible, I cannot simply agree with both traditions.  But because of incommensurability, I cannot directly convince the adherents of the rival tradition that they are wrong (nor can they directly convince me).  I can, however, learn to be &quot;bilingual&quot; in the two traditions.  The Aristotelian can learn, for example, to &quot;speak Confucian,&quot; as it were.  Having done so, he occupies a special perspective, from which he may conclude that the Confucian worldview offers a superior interpretation of the strengths and weaknesses of his own tradition.  Or he may conclude the opposite.Or he may conclude that some sort of synthesis is possible, which is superior to either one individually.  For this reason also, relativism is not true, despite the fact that traditions are, when speaking one to the other, incommensurable:  someone occupying one tradition *can* see that his views are fundamentally mistaken.<br />MacIntyre argues that, of the four traditions he considers in this book, three have entered inescapable epistemological crises, while one (the tradition of Thomas Aquinas) has answered all challenges so far.  The bulk of the book is a history of the four traditions.  If you want to get the outline of MacIntyre's view, I recommend chapters 1 (the intro), 7-8 (on Aristotle), 9 (on Augustine), 10-11 (on Aquinas's synthesis), 16 (on Hume), 17 (on liberalism), and 18-20 (MacIntyre's grand theory).<br />This is, of course, an easier book to read if you have read some previous philosophy (Thomas Kuhn's _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ is in the background of much of what MacIntyre says, even though he doesn't cite Kuhn very often), but a bright, motivated non-philosopher can read and greatly enjoy this book too.posite.

US	52852809	R34TH2VRXB55AR	037571412X	591651540	The Dying Animal	Books	5	14	15	N	N	An entertaining and deep meditation on human sexuality	This is a review of _The Dying Animal_ by Philip Roth (in the Vintage Books paperback edition).<br />A friend recommended this novella to me, and I'm very glad she did.  It really isn't going too far to describe it (as one published review did) as a \\"masterpiece.\\"<br />The narrator is \\"David Kepesh,\\" a sexagenarian college professor and minor celebrity intellectual (he has a PBS show) who routinely sleeps with selected female students from his advanced seminar (wisely waiting until after the grades have been turned in -- although nowadays only a \\"David Kepesh\\" or a Philip Roth could get away with even this).  Kepesh describes (to an unidentified interlocutor, who remains silent until the book's final page) the trajectory of his affair with a Cuban-American student, Consuela Castillo.  Along the way, there are interesting (and relevant to the story) digressions on America's sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's, the colonial-era sexual and religious radical Thomas Morton, the surreal nature of the Y2K celebrations, etc.<br />This is one of those lovely books that works on many different levels.  First, it is a funny book.  Those with delicate sensibilities will be offended by some of the humor, but it's hard not to laugh.  This is also (unsurprisingly for a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist) a well written book:  \\"That body is still new to her, she's still trying it out, thinking it through, a bit like a kid walking the streets with a loaded gun and deciding whether he's packing it to protect himself or to begin a life of crime\\" (p. 4).<br />But what most engaged me was how Roth uses the novel to explore some of the thorny issues that surround human sexuality.  Let's face it:  sex is complicated.  Power is part of what complicates it.  And the power is inescapable:  \\"You're going to rule out dominance?  You're going to rule out yielding?  The dominating is the flint, it strikes the spark, it sets it going\\" (p. 20).  We begin the novel thinking that the professor has the position of power in this relationship.  (Campus sexual harassment rules seem to take this for granted.)  But it soon becomes clear that Kepesh is the more infatuated one.  (Or is he?  For in this novel, as in real life, everything is complex and uncertain.)<br />Sex is further complicated by marriage, for which Kepesh has harsh words:  \\"Look, heterosexual men going into marriage are like priests going into the Church:  they take the vow of chastity, only seemingly without knowing it until three, four, five years down the line\\" (p. 67).  Kepesh's response to this discovery in his own case was to divorce his wife.  His son never forgave him for this, and to prove that he is a better man than his father, he has stayed in an unhappy marraige rather than walk out.<br />The general philosophical perspective of the book is (in a very broad sense) Nietzschean.  The narrator is an advocate of freeing oneself from convention and sentimental attachment.  His son is a prime example of someone whose \\"morality\\" is simply a self-mortifying effort at feeling morally superior to others.  However, part of Roth's genius as a novelist is that he does not succumb to the temptation to force his characters to toe an ideological line.  In this novel (again, as in life), reality is always at least a little bit in friction with our philosophy.  So, Kepesh finds himself wondering aloud, \\"I don't even know after a while what I'm desperate for.  ...  Her soul?  Her youth?  Her simple mind?  Maybe it's worse than that -- maybe now that I'm nearing death, I also long secretly not to be free\\" (p. 106).<br />This is a Platonic view of love.  (Like Kepesh, I apologize for my academic tone, but \\"I'm a teacher -- didacticism is my destiny\\" [p. 112].)  For Plato, love is painful, love destroys who we were -- but it is also the only thing that can make us whole, and can make us greater than we once were.<br />So, on the last page of the story (don't worry -- I won't reveal details), Kepesh is facedwith an existential choice:  is freedom more important than anything, and worth abandoning or destroying anything that interferes with it (as Nietzsche thought)?  Or is the pain of love a guide to where we must go, to become complete (as Plato said)?<br />This is \\"the eternal problem of attachment\\" (p. 105), and the central theme of this wonderful book.d with an existential choice:  is freedom more important than anything, and worth abandoning or destroying anything that interferes with it (as Nietzsche thought)?

Roughly speaking, literary Chinese (also called \\"Classical Chinese\\") is to modern Chinese as Latin is to Italian (or as Sanskrit is to Hindi).  Literary Chinese was (according to most scholars) originally the written form of spoken Chinese, but it became a literary language used for writing and reading.  Amazingly, it became the standard literary language for not only pre-modern China, but also for pre-modern Korea, Japan and Vietnam.  (This is amazing because spoken Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese are actually not historically related to each other in the way that the European languages are related to each other.)<br /><br />Few English-speakers learn Classical Chinese, of course, so there are few English-language textbooks for it.  Michael Fuller has produced a very nice one.<br /><br />This book assumes that the reader has some familiarity with Chinese characters (as by studying a year or two of modern Chinese or Japanese).  This book will NOT teach you how to recognize the parts of a character (which is a crucial skill in memorizing them), or how to write them, or how to use a dictionary.  So someone with no knowledge of Chinese will almost certainly find this book extremely intimidating.<br /><br />However, this is really good book, I think, for students with some previous exposure to Chinese characters.  Fuller's Introduction begins with a clear, sensible explanation of basic hermeneutic issues (e.g., why \\"Grammar Is Not Enough\\").  He then presents a learned but clear overview of grammar and phonology, with a bibliography for further reading.<br /><br />This is well done, but I think most students should skip it and dive right into the first lesson.  The first eight lessons each introduce a major grammatical feature (e.g., \\"Nominal and Verbal Sentences,\\" \\"Parts of Speech,\\" etc.).  The structure of these chapters is explanation, Chinese text (long form characters throughout), vocabulary list (including pronunciations using pinyin romanizations), grammar notes, and exercises.<br /><br />One of the things I like best about this book is that, right from the beginning, Fuller uses actual Classical Chinese texts.  Lesson one uses two brief passages from the Analects of Confucius.  I think it will be very exciting for students to be reading the \\"greats\\" of Chinese thought from the get-go.<br /><br />Beginning with Lesson 9 (p. 103), the notes become less extensive.  However, the new vocabulary items are still identified, and discussion questions of the content, and grammatical \\"review questions\\" (e.g., \\"Is X used as a coverb here?\\") are added.  Then starting with Lesson 25 (p. 175), readings include only new vocabulary items (although when an author appears for the first time in this section, Fuller supplies a general introduction to him, and brief suggestions for further reading).  The reading selections close with \\"Selected Tang and Song Dynasty Writings\\" (p. 229ff.), which are only the Chinese text, with no vocabulary or notes.  Before this last section, all the readings are ALMOST all from the Warring States Period (403-221 BC) or Han Dynasty (202 BC to AD 220).  This is a good choice, since these periods are generally thought to have produced the paradigms of Classical Chinese style.<br /><br />If you are desperate to teach yourself Classical Chinese, and cannot begin with a good course in Modern Chinese, I would recommend buying this book with _Reading and Writing Chinese_ by William McNaughton, which walks you through how to write many of the most common characters.

I have a fair amount of experience playing computer games, including some experience playing a MMORPG (massively multi-player online roleplaying game).  Specifically, I played Lineage for several months.  I got bored with it eventually, and the sample graphics for EverQuest that I saw looked great, so I decided to switch.

In the bookstore, this book looked pretty good.  And it certainly does have its strengths.  There are LOTS of tables.  For example,  I've currently got one character that's a Necromancer Erudite and one player that's a Magician Erudite.  There are charts telling you what spells each character can learn at each level, as well as maps of the cities of Paineel and Erudin, where these two characters start out (respectively).  There are also extensive descriptions of the characteristics of each &quot;race&quot; and &quot;class&quot; of character, including info on what to do if you want to &quot;solo&quot; (play individually) or &quot;group&quot; (cooperate with other players in a group).  Since I'm an anti-social person, I like to solo, so I was able to figure out that a Necromancer is good for me.<br />However, I would have liked a little bit more &quot;hand holding.&quot;  When you start as a Necromancer, you are in a room with four NPC's (non-playable characters, i.e. computer-controlled characters) also in the room.  I could figure out for myself that I should go to each character and use the functions explained in the manual on each one (click my cursor on it for info, and &quot;Hail&quot; it to see if it talks to me).  So far so good.  But what do I do next?  Here are some things I could not find in the book, that I wish I had been told.  (1)  There are two doors out of this room.  It turns out that you're supposed to go into the next room on the same floor, and then give one of your scrolls to the character in that room, who will then give you your first quest.  It also turns out that, as a reward for completing this quest, you will get some good spells, so you should not bother to buy any spells even after you get some money (at least not until your character can start using level-four spells).  (2)  The spell you really want at first is called &quot;cavorting bones.&quot;  It creates a skeleton &quot;familiar&quot; that makes killing things MUCH easier.  (If you don't get it when you complete the first quest, you should probably buy it, if you can afford it.)  (3)  If you have to buy this spell, you can get it in the spellshop that is downstairs from the room you started in, off the main hall on that floor.  (This spellshop is not marked on the map the book provides of Paineel -- parts of this map are very confusing, and other parts are inaccurate.)  (4)  When you try to leave the city, there is a bug in the use of the key.  (You will find the key already in your inventory when you start.)  To get out, go to the exit door, face it, call up your inventory, click on the key to get it on your cursor, hold it in the middle of the screen, and type &quot;u&quot;.  (I only found this out by &quot;petitioning&quot; a gamemaster -- a process which IS described in this book, fortunately.)  (5)  To return to the city, find the rock near where you go out of the city.  You will notice that it is tear-shaped.  Stand at the narrow (I think) end of it, put the key on your cursor again, and type &quot;u&quot;.  (I found this out by dumb luck and mindless repetition.)<br />I'm not trying to give a lecture on the game here, my point is just that this is stuff that is needlessly tiresome if you merely want to enjoy an immersion role-playing experience.

Neo-Confucians sought to explicate, propogate, and defend the Confucian tradition against Buddhism and Taoism, which they saw as decadent.  However, many people (including myself) think that Neo-Confucianism is itself heavily influenced by Buddhist metaphysical concepts (especially Zen Buddhist ideas).  Nonetheless, Neo-Confucianism is a very interesting philosophical movement in its own right.<br /><br />As this book's title indicates, the \\"four-seven debate\\" is the most famous controversy in Korean Neo-Confucianism.  The topic initially seems pretty dry.  The issue is how to reconcile the list of FOUR emotional reactions that the ancient Confucian Mencius identifies as the basis for human virtue (e.g., sympathy is the basis for benevolence, disdain is the basis for righteousness, etc.) with the list of SEVEN emotions that appears in texts such as the Mean.  Now, before you say \\"Who cares?\\" and click on another link, let me give you an interpretation of what this is really about.<br /><br />Neo-Confucians think that everything in existence is composed of LI (\\"principle\\"), an underlying metaphysical structure shared by all things, and CH'I, which is variously translated, but refers to an intrinsically unstructured \\"stuff.\\"  \\"Principle\\" cannot exist without CH'I to inhere in, but CH'I cannot exist without \\"principle\\" to structure it.  So far so good.  But in both Chinese and Korean Confucianism a question arises about how principle and CH'I are related.  People in one tradition (that associated with the philosopher Chu Hsi, see Daniel Gardner's translation, Learning to Be a Sage) hold that the principle can be conceptually abstracted from its embodiment in CH'I, and that doing so makes it easier for us to be guided by principle.  However, those in the other wing of Neo-Confucianism (that associated with the philosopher Wang Yang-ming, see Philip J. Ivahoe's Ethics in the Confucian Tradition) hold that it is a distortion to separate principle and CH'I even conceptually.<br /><br />The importance of this debate is that the Chu Hsi wing thinks you can read the classic texts to learn the abstractions of principle, and thereby cultivate yourself ethically.  The Wang Yang-ming wing insists that all right action is inherently context sensitive, so you have to rely more on your innate moral sense than classic texts.<br /><br />Scholars will note that I have oversimplified a bit, but I hope I've brought out some of the reason that this book is interesting.  I should also note that the translation seems very good, and that the parties to the debater wrote very clearly about this issue, so if you're willing to think carefully about philosophical issues you can follow the debate.sociated with the philosopher Wang Yang-ming, see Philip J.

Instead of calling this a \\"translation,\\" he calls it an \\"English version.\\"  But why would you want to read a loose English paraphrase by someone who can't read either the original or the early Chinese commentaries on it when you could read a translation by any one of a number of gifted and insightful scholars?<br />The standard defense of a \\"version\\" like Mitchell's is that he has some special insight into the text that entitles him to interpret it.  But the danger of an interpretation like Mitchell's is that it projects modern Western preconceptions onto the Tao Te Ching instead of allowing us to be challenged by the powerful, paradoxical, and even frightening original text. In fact, Mitchell projects Zen Buddhist and New Age ideas into his \\"interpetation.\\"  (And, No, Zen Buddhism is not the same as Taoism, any more than Catholicism is the same as Judaism.)  Someone who actually reads the original Classical Chinese, and is familiar with the historical and cultural context in which the text was composed is much more likely to be insightful about the text.  Another common comment is that someone like Mitchell doesn't get lost in boring scholarly stuff.  But there are plenty of exciting, fun to read translations by people who can actually read the original.  The first Tao Te Ching translation I read was by D.C. Lau.  He was a truly great scholar, but his translation is very elegant and very readable.  Other terrific translations by people who actually know the \\"text and context\\" include those by Victor Mair, Robert Henricks, and Philip J. Ivanhoe.  (Ivanhoe's translation is available both as a separate book, and as part of the anthology he co-edited, Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy.)<br />Oh, and the \\"editorial review\\" that Amazon lists above is actually not a review of Mitchell's translation at all.  (There is no way to report that using their \\"corrections\\" button.)	2002-04-26

This book (a reprint, it was originally published in 1968) is a critical introduction to the &quot;classic&quot; Chinese novels.  Specifically, it has chapters on _The Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, _The Water Margin_, _Journey to the West_, _Chin P'ing Mei_, _The Scholars_, and _Dream of the Red Chamber_.  There is also an appendix on &quot;Society and Self in the Chinese Story&quot; and bibliographies of translations and other works about each novel.<br />I found this to be a very clear, informative, and insightful introduction to these great works of Chinese literature.  Hsia provides the context necessary to understand the origin of each novel, as well as a discussion of some of the most important interpretive issues raised by each book.  I found that I could appreciate these novels much better with some help from Hsia.  Part of the reason for this, I think is that Hsia's style of writing is pleasantly &quot;pre-postmodern&quot; (that is, clear and unpretentious).<br />There are good English translations of all the novels Hsia discusses except for _The Water Margin_.  Several of them are quite long, so you would not be a total wimp for reading a condensed version.  Moss Roberts has both a complete and a selected translation of _Three Kingdoms_ (a heroic war story).  Arthur Waley's _Monkey_ is the most widely read selected translation of _Journey to the West_ (a funny and fantastic story of a religious pilgrimage).  David Roy's _The Plum in the Golden Vase_ is a partial translation of the erotic novel, _Chin P'ing Mei_.  _The Story of the Stone_ is the alternative title of _Dream of the Red Chamber_ a sort of romance/Buddhist parable, that has been translated in five (gulp!) volumes by David Hawkes.  _The Story of the Stone_ is supposed to be the greatest Chinese novel, and it certainly has some very great parts, but overall I found it too slow moving.  My own favorite of the classic Chinese novels is _The Scholars_, a satire of hypocrisy and immorality among Confucian literati, available in a handsome translation by Hsien-I Yang and Gladys Yang.<br />So buy this book, along with a good translation of one of the novels that Hsia discusses, and sit down for a great read!nfucian literati, available in a handsome translation by Hsien-I Yang and Gladys Yang.<br />So buy this book, along with a good translation of one of the novels that Hsia discusses, and sit down for a great read!	2001-02-21

This is an abridged reprint of a book originally published in 1937.<br />This book by anthropologist Evans-Pritchard is best understood as a reaction against the work of the earlier anthropologist Levy-Bruhl.  Levy-Bruhl had argued that &quot;primitive&quot; people have a &quot;pre-logical&quot; mentality, in that they are willing to accept worldviews that include contradictions.  Evans-Pritchard disagrees, and uses the case study of the Azande, an African tribe, to make his point.<br />The Azande routinely appealled to &quot;witchcraft&quot; in their daily lives.  (I cannot say how accurate Evans-Pritchard's account was of the Azande during his stay, or how much they have changed since the 30's.)  For example, the Azande would explain at least some bad events as the result of witchcraft being practiced against them, and would use a &quot;poison oracle&quot; to determine who the witch was.  (&quot;Azande&quot; is the noun, &quot;Zande&quot; is the adjective, like &quot;Britons&quot; vs. &quot;British.&quot;)  At first glance, this all seems irrational.  However, Evans-Pritchard sets out the Azande beliefs in a way that shows that they form a fairly coherent system.  He also notes that it was possible for him to live according to these beliefs during his stay with the Azande.<br />This book (and some of Evans-Pritchard's essays) have stimulated an immense amount of secondary literature.  Peter Winch (see his articles in Bryan R. Wilson, ed., _Rationality_) argues that Evans-Pritchard did not go far enough, because Evans-Pritchard claims that the Zande beliefs (while not &quot;pre-logical&quot;), are nontheless unscientific, and mistaken.  Winch argues that the test of whether something (e.g., electrons or witchraft) is real depends on the language and culture within which the judgment is being made.  Consequently, it is simply a sort of category mistake to desribe the Zande beliefs as unscientific, since &quot;science&quot; is our standard of rationality, not their standard.<br />Charles Taylor (in an essay in the volume of his collected papers on &quot;rationality and the human sciences&quot;) argues against Winch that, since the Azande beliefs have empirical consequences (e.g., there should be &quot;witchcraft-substance&quot; in the intestines of actual witches), it must be possible to test the Zande claims.  Consequently, the Zande beliefs can fail (or conceivably pass) scientific verification.<br />If you are interested in contemporary anthropological studies of Africa, you should look for a more recent book.  However, this is an interesting gateway to some challenging debates over how to think about rationality cross-culturally.tandard.  <br />Charles Taylor (in an essay in the volume of his collected papers on &quot;rationality and the human sciences&quot;) argues against Winch that, since the Azande beliefs have empirical consequences (e.g., there should be &quot;witchcraft-substance&quot; in the intestines of actual witches), it must be possible to test the Zande claims.

Lau's translation of the _Tao Te Ching_, as republished in the Everyman's Library series.<br />The _Tao Te Ching_ is a collection of brief sayings and verse attributed to Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu is semi-mythical. He is traditionally supposed to have been a contemporary of Confucius (about 500 B.C.), but he may just be a \\"composite\\" of stories about various early sages. The _Tao Te Ching_ itself is probably an anthology of early wisdom literature. It is concise to the point of being cryptic. Ironically, this probably helps to account for its popularity. Since it is so hard to understand, people tend to find in it what they want to find.<br />For millennia, the standard text of the _Tao Te Ching_ was the \\"Wang Pi text,\\" named after an early commentator. However, earlier versions of the text were unearthed in a tomb in China in the 70's. These were called the \\"Ma-wang-tui\\" versions, after the place where the tomb was located.<br />D.C. Lau was one of the most talented translators of the 20th century. His translations of the _Analects_ of Confucius, the _Mencius_, and the _Tao Te Ching_ are among the best available. His original translation of the _Tao Te Ching_ was based on the Wang Bi text, and was published by Penguin Books. The book on this page includes both the original Penguin Books translation and a revised translation based on the Ma-wang-tui texts.<br />Lau is a very well informed scholar, but he does not allow the scholarship to overwhelm the translation. The language of his translation is concise and elegant. There will always be deep controversy over how to translate this deeply enigmatic text, but Lau's interpretations are always defensible.<br />One disadvantage of this book is that it does not include the introduction to Lau's Penguin Books translation. That introduction was itself one of the better philosophical studies of the _Tao Te Ching_. Overall, though, this is a fine translation in an elegant (and reasonably priced) format. I strongly recommend it.<br />Some different, but equally good, translations are those by Victor Mair and Philip J. Ivanhoe. Mair's translation has been published as a separate book, while Ivanhoe's is included in Ivanhoe and Bryan W. Van Norden, eds., _Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy_. If you would like some help interpreting the _Tao Te Ching_, a good collection of secondary essays is Mark Csikszentmihalyi and Philip J.

This is actually three books bound together.  Each is a very good translation of a major ancient Chinese philosophical text.  Although these philosophers are not as well known in the West as Confucius or Lao Tzu, they are very much worth reading.<br />Mo Tzu was an early critic of Confucianism; he founded a movement known as &quot;Mohism.&quot;  The Mohists advocated &quot;universal love.&quot;  This is less sexy than it sounds:  they mean simply caring for each person equally, as opposed to the Confucian doctrine that one should care more for family members than for strangers.  Mo Tzu is noteworthy because he is perhaps the first Chinese sage to present genuine philosophical arguments.  The &quot;essays&quot; in this collection will challenge your preconceptions about Chinese philosophy:  they are practical, hard-headed, and relentlessly rational.<br />Hsun Tzu (pronounced like &quot;syun zuh&quot;) was a major figure in later Confucianism.  He is best known for his doctrine that &quot;human nature is evil.&quot;  This teaching got him condemned by Song and Ming Dynasty Confucians, who thought that the view of the rival philosopher Mencius that human nature is good was the orthodox view.  However, Hsun Tzu is a careful, systematic, and eclectic thinker.  He may be the greatest Confucian philosopher of ancient China.<br />Han Fei Tzu was a figure in the so-called &quot;Legalist&quot; movement.  Although Legalism could sometimes be pushed to draconian extremes, Han Fei Tzu has lots of insightful advice about realpolitik.<br />Burton Watson is one of the leading translators of Chinese philosophy and literature.  He lives in Japan, and is heavily reliant on Japanese scholarship, but Japanese translations of Chinese texts are often pretty good, so this isn't a bad thing.	2001-01-22

However, in East Asia he is known as &quot;the second sage&quot; of Confucianism -- second only to Confucius himself.  The eponymous _Mencius_ is a collection of his sayings and dialogues with disciples, rulers, and rival philosophers.  It is unfortunate that this work is not more widely read outside of Asia.  It is more accessible than the often cryptic _Analects_ of Confucius.  Furthermore, Mencius is arguably a deeper philosophical thinker than Confucius.  Buy this book and you'll get a fine translation of a classic of world literature and philosophy.<br />Mencius is most famous for his claim that human nature is good.  He illustrates this by asking us to imagine a person who suddenly sees a child about to fall into a well.  Anyone, Mencius claims, would have a feeling of alarm and compassion at this sight.  This feeling is a manifestation of our innate tendency toward benevolence.  Mencius is aware that, despite having this innate tendency toward virtue, most people fail to act in a benevolent manner.  But he claims that this is due to bad environmental factors, as well as a failure to cultivate one's &quot;sprouts&quot; of virtue.  (Lau translates &quot;sprout&quot; as &quot;germ,&quot; a minor infelicity.)<br />Lau's _Mencius_ is probably the best complete translation of this work in English.  It also includes extensive supporting material:  an interpretive introduction, a glossary, and appendices on events in the life of Mencius, early traditions about Mencius, the text of the _Mencius_, ancient history as understood by Mencius, and Mencius's method of argumentation.<br />James Legge also did a complete translation, _The Works of Mencius_, which is a little dated (it was completed in the late 19th century), but it is still a good translation, and includes the Chinese text, along with extensive notes.  I did a partial translation of the _Mencius_ for _Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy_.	2001-01-19

Most people have heard of Lao Tzu, the alleged author of the Tao Te Ching.  However, cognoscenti know that the writings attributed to the Chinese &quot;Taoist&quot; Chuang Tzu are at least as interesting, challenging, and profound.<br />Chuang Tzu shows his mastery of almost every form of writing in this work:  parable, humor, philosophial dialogue, even what seem like brief philosophical essays.  Sometimes the net effect is quite dizzying:  what are we to make of the story of how Chuang Tzu was dreaming that he was a butterfly, and then awoke, but was unsure whether he was Chuang Tzu who had been dreaming that he was a butterfly, or a butterfly who was now dreaming that he was Chuang Tzu?!  And how is a butcher who carves an ox carcass with seemingly supernatural grace and ease a model for how we should lead our lives?  Understand this book or not, you'll have fun reading it!<br />The eponymous book, the _Chuang Tzu_ is actually a collection of writings by different authors from different periods.  However, many scholars believe that the so-called &quot;Inner Chapters&quot; are by one hand.  Watson's translation includes all of these, as well as selections from some of the other portions of the text.  (Watson has also published separately a complete translation, although it is rather expensive.)  Watson is a very gifted translator, and his love for this text shows.  This is one of the standard translations, and for good reason.  (One tidbit:  Watson seems to translate into English, not from the original Chinese, but from Japanese translations of the Chinese.  Surprisingly, the result is very good.)<br />There is much disagreement over how to interpret Chuang Tzu, so you may want to compare how different translators do different things with the same text.  A.C. Graham's translation (soon to be reprinted, I understand) is excellent, with helpful introductory material, but Graham rearranges the text according to his own sometimes idiosyncratic view of how it should be organized.  Victor Mair's translation is also excellent, and gives a reasonably priced version of the complete Chuang Tzu.  (I often find Watson's English the most beautiful of the three.)<br />For help in understanding the text, Victor Mair has edited an anthology of secondary essays on it, and so have Philip J.

I think it was Mark Twain who said that a classic is a book that everybody wants to *have* read, but that nobody wants to read.  The Scholars is an exception to this generalization.  It is one of the masterpieces of the Chinese novel, but it is as fun for a contemporary American to read today as it was for Wu Ching-tzu's contemporaries to read in imperial China.<br />This book is an incisive satire of hypocrisy and corruption among Confucian intellectuals.  Although the circumstances of the stories will be unfamiliar to the general reader, this translation supplies supporting material that will help explain the context.  And we immediately identify with the cast of characters and their catalogue of vices:  arrogant officials, obsequious would-be officials, impoverished students who become exactly like those who exploit them as soon as they are given a chance, etc.<br />Wu Ching-tzu's worldview is not wholly negative, though.  There are characters in this world who have honor.  We get the sense that the author believes that the true spirit of Confucianism is very different from the debased institutional form it has taken in his era.<br />One brilliant but challenging feature of this work is that it is not a simple linear narrative.  Wu Ching-tzu weaves the stories of individuals in and out of one another.  One storyline will abruptly stop, seemingly abandoned; another storyline will begin; then the characters from the previous storyline will reappear in the new story.  This is dazzling narrative, but sometimes a little hard to follow:  I recommend that you scrawl some brief notes in the margins or the back of the book so that you can remember who a character is when he or she reappears somewhere down the road.  (I did a chart myself.)  Believe me, though, it's worth the effort to fully appreciate this book.<br />This is a delightful, humorous, and humane novel that will transport you to another world, but leave you with insights into human nature that are universal.	2000-12-17

However, there is one more issue that I would like to draw attention to.  Melville is concerned in &quot;Billy Budd&quot; with the human capacity for malevolence:  doing evil for the sake of evil.<br />Some other 19th-century American authors like Emerson and Thoreau have fairly &quot;sunny&quot; views of human nature.  Melville (along with Poe and Hawthorne) thought it was dangerous to ignore the other side of being human.  In particular, Melville wants to address the question, Can a person do evil just for the sake of being evil?<br />Why does Claggart hate Billy Budd so much?  Jealousy may be part of it, but that could not explain the depth of his hatred.  Claggart is simply pure evil.  His evil is motivated by nothing but the love of evil itself.  Melville wants us to see that people like Claggart are a real possibility.  And those who, like Billy Budd, are &quot;innocent&quot; will be helpless in the face of such evil.<br />If these issues interest you, you can pursue this topic through Poe's great short story, &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; and St. Augustine's _Confessions_, especially &quot;Book II&quot; (really a chapter in length).<br />The other great story in this anthology is &quot;Bartleby, Scrivener.&quot;  It seems, on the surface, to be merely a story about mental illness.  A clerk starts to simply refuse to do his work, until he cannot care for himself any more, and is committed to an insane asylum.  But this is not a story only about depression.  The key of the story is that Bartleby once worked in the &quot;dead letter&quot; department of the post office.  Seeing the mountains of letters -- carrying the hopes, fears, and plans of so many people -- ending in a sort of clerical limbo, helped destroy Bartleby's sense that life has a point.  Now, Bartleby suffers from the &quot;deadly sin&quot; of sloth (better described as &quot;spiritual apathy&quot;).  He lacks the faith, hope and charity needed to find meaning in life.  Consequently, he gradually sinks into inaction.bed as &quot;spiritual apathy&quot;).  He lacks the faith, hope and charity needed to find meaning in life.

I usually try to review only books that have not yet been reviewed, but I had to weigh in on this one.<br />As you can tell from the other reviews, this is a book that tends to polarize readers.  The book has this effect, I believe, because it takes a stand on some crucial and interrelated issues in philosophy:  the relationship between the mental and the physical, what it is to be the &quot;same person,&quot; and objectivity in ethics.<br />The American pragmatist William James once said that there are two kinds of philosophers:  the heard-headed and the soft-hearted.  On the above issues, the hard-headed philosophers tend to say that what is real is what is objective.  The soft-hearted tend to say that, while objectivity has its place, any adequate view of the world must acknowledge the reality of one's own subjective viewpoint, and one's own personal commitments and projects.  Nagel is in the soft-hearted camp, which means that he will draw the ire of the heard-headed thinkers.  (Professional philosophers will recognize that I am greatly oversimplifying -- but remember that most readers are not professional philosophers.)<br />Hard-headed philosophers will also object to Nagel's style.  He can be somewhat obscure at points.  However, Nagel suggests that it is sometimes worth being unclear but closer to the truth, rather than being very clear, yet far from it.  That said, he is hardly as obscure as, say, Kant or Sartre (to pick two examples at random).  And I think someone bright who is willing to think hard, and who wants to listen in as a major philosopher argues with his colleagues over major issues in contemporary philosophy,  would get a lot out of this book.  (Indeed, I think such a reader would get more out this book than she would out of a &quot;dumbed down&quot; popular book on philosophy.)	2000-12-07

Dubs translation of the writings of the ancient Chinese Confucian philosopher Hsuntze (whose name is more commonly written &quot;Hsun Tzu&quot; or &quot;Xunzi&quot;).<br />Hsuntze was famous for claiming that &quot;human nature is bad.&quot;  This contrasted with the view of the earlier Confucian Mencius, who said that &quot;human nature is good.&quot;  Later Confucians decided that Mencius was the orthodox transmitter of the Confucian &quot;Way.&quot;  Consequently, they have tended to denigrate Hsuntze, or suggest that he did not really mean that human nature is bad.  However, recent scholars of Chinese philosophy have come to recognize that Hsuntze is a brilliant, systematic thinker, whose works repay careful study.  He produced an original synthesis of Confucianism and non-Confucian philosophies.  For some of the classic papers on the thought of Hsuntze, see Kline and Ivanhoe, eds., Virtue, Nature, and Agency in the Xunzi.<br />Dubs translates &quot;chapters&quot; 1-2, 4-11, and 15-23 of the complete works attributed to Hsuntze.  Every library should have a copy of this translation, and every scholar should have one on her shelf, but the general reader is probably better off with the briefer translation by Burton Watson, Hsun Tzu:  Selected Writings, or the complete multi-volume translation by John Knoblock.	2000-12-07

James Legge was a 19th-century Scottish missionary to China.  This is his translation of the &quot;Four Books&quot; and three of the &quot;Five Classics.&quot;  The translations are dated, and Legge's interpretations of the texts are often old-fashioned, but these are still important and useful translations.<br />Of the &quot;Five Classics,&quot; Legge translates the Book of Documents (a collection of historical texts), the Spring and Autumn Annals (another historical work; Legge also includes his translation of the Tso Commentary on this), and the Book of Odes.  (The other two of the five are the Record of Rites and the I Ching, which Legge also translated, but which are not in this collection.)  The &quot;Five Classics&quot; have been central texts of Confucianism since about the time of Christ.<br />The &quot;Four Books&quot; are the Great Learning, the Analects of Confucius, the sayings of the later Confucian Mencius, and the Doctrine of the Mean.  These texts are all quite old, but they were grouped together, and made the basis of the Confucian educational curriculum, around the 12th century A.D.<br />Part of what makes Legge's translations so helpful is that he includes the Chinese text, along with extensive interpretive notes, introductions, and glossaries.  This can be a little overwhelming for the beginner, but it's fun to have all the information in one place.<br />One caution:  This set is normally in 5 volumes.  I assume that this edition has combined the 1st and 2nd volumes (the &quot;Four Books&quot;) into one volume, but it is possible that this edition does not include all that I think it does.	2000-12-03

This is a version of the classic story, simplified for kids.  (The written version is a little different from the movie.)  Although it is simplified, the sentences are complex enough to stretch the minds of younger readers.<br />The book also has many illustrations (almost every other page is a black-and-white drawing).  Unfortunately, the style of the illustrations reminds one of contemporary comic books (not a bad style in itself, but inappropriate for this book, I think).  In addition, the illustrations do not always precisely match the description given in the text.  Still, they do help to break up the text, and hold the interest of younger kids.<br />The description says that this is intended for readers at the grade school level, but my three-year-old twins enjoyed having it read to them.  (Then again, they have very long attention spans.)  I was worried that they would find it too scary (in this version, the tinman kills a bunch of wolves with his axe, and the scarecrow breaks the necks of some evil crows), but they told me they weren't scared, and they don't seem to have had any bad dreams.

The subjects are all female (if you count one baby, of indeterminate gender), and are frequently nude.  If you are open minded, I think you will find many (perhaps all) of these pictures erotic -- whatever your sexual orientation.  However, this is art, not mediocre porn.<br />The images are generally fragments of women's bodies:  a breast, a foot, a chin, a face, or just an eye.  This makes it sound as if the women are objectified, but the photos always seem to invite us to revel in the beauty of the form.  I, at least, feel that the pictures produce a sort of tender admiration (an &quot;erotic&quot; gaze, in the proper Greek sense of the term).<br />I disagreed with the reviewer who found Mary Gaitskill's Afterword &quot;vulgar.&quot;  (But then, Gaitskill tends to polarize readers.)

This is a delightful dialogue (based loosely on historical figures) between King Milinda and the Buddhist monk Nagasena.  The king has an acute philosophical mind, and asks the monk challenging questions about the Buddhist teachings, and in particular about the puzzling doctrine of anatman (&quot;no self&quot;).  Why do Buddhists believe that there is no self?  If there are no selves, why do we (including Buddhists) talk as if there are?  How is ethics possible without the notion of a self?  How can Buddhists believe in reincarnation without there being a self that is reincarnated?<br />The reader should be ready to do some serious philosophical thinking, but Nagasena helps us by using charming and vivid examples to illustrate his points.  For example, he says that what the Buddhists mean by reincarnation is like a flame being passed from candle to candle:  no &quot;substance&quot; (or self) is transmitted, but there is an important causal connection.	2000-11-30

Shun has well-defended positions regarding Mencius's views on the key virtues (benevolence, righteousness, wisdom and propriety), and the relationships among the human heart-mind, human nature, and ethical cultivation.<br />This is a real tour de force as a work of scholarship, although it may be heavy going for the general reader at times.	2000-11-27

Chu Hsi (pronounced like &quot;jew shee&quot;) is almost unknown in the West.  However, he is widely recognized in East Asia as one of the most brilliant and influential Confucian philosophers of all time.  Chu Hsi's interpretation of Confucianism became the basis of the civil service examinations in China in the early 14th century A.D., and remained so until the examinations were abolished in the early 20th century.  Consequently, generations of intellectuals memorized Chu Hsi's views.<br />Gardner has done a terrific job translating selections from &quot;The Conversations of Master Chu, Topically Arranged,&quot; a collection of Chu Hsi's sayings recorded and organized by his disciples.  Gardner has translated a part of the massive &quot;Conversations&quot; dealing with methods of ethical cultivation.  Gardner supplements these selections with excerpts from Chu Hsi's metaphysical comments.  This is very helpful, since Chu Hsi's views on cultivation are connected to his metaphysical views.  Gardner is a well respected scholar of Chu Hsi, and his introduction helps situate Master Chu historically.<br />People who are interested in Chinese philosophy usually go to the obvious places:  the sayings of Confucius, the Tao Te Ching, or the Yi Ching.

This book is essential reading for anyone seriously interested in Confucius, Confucianism, or early Chinese thought in general.  It is quite convincing on some points, but also very problematic on others.<br />Fingarette was a mainstream Western philosopher, who said that when he first read Confucius, he found him to be a &quot;prosaic and parochial moralizer.&quot;  However, he eventually became convinced that Confucius had &quot;an imaginative vision of man equal in its grandeur&quot; to any that he knew.<br />Fingarette is at his best explaining the importance of ritual in Confucianism.  Most of us nowadays think of rituals as useless affectations.  However, Fingarette shows that Confucius regarded rituals (from handshaking to funerals) as an important part of being human.  It is when we participate in such ritual activities that we are most distinctively human.  In addition, ritual has the power to enable humans to work together without the need for coercion.  Perhaps if we in the West can recover the feeling for the importance of shared, sacred rituals, we can help give more unity to our chaotic society.<br />Fingarette was also deeply influenced by Western behaviorism, and this leads to some of the less plausible aspects of his book.  He wishes to deny that there is any &quot;internal&quot; dimension to Confucius' thought.  If what Fingarette wishes to claim is that Confucius did not think of human psychology the way that, say, Augustine or Descartes did, then he is quite correct.  (But then who is Fingarette arguing with?  No serious interpreter I know of has read Confucius as a Cartesian.)  However, Fingarette sometimes seems to want to claim that emotions and attitudes are, for Confucius, perfectly public states.  I think that this is to project Western behaviorism onto Confucius (and behaviorism itself derives what limited plausibility it has from being a reaction to more extreme forms of Cartesianism).<br />Warts and all, this is still a classic book on Confucius after almost twenty years.  If you want to learn more about Confucius, H.G. Creel's _Confucius and the Chinese Way_ is worth reading.  For broader surveys of Confucianism, you might read Philip J.

Bernard (pronounced BER-nerd -- he's a Brit) Williams is one of the leading Anglo-American philosophers of the late 20th century.  He has written a number of seminal essays on ethics and personal identity.  The essays in this collection include several of his classic pieces.<br />&quot;Persons, character and morality&quot; is an insightul critique of Kantianism in ethics.  Williams argues that ethics should not demand of us that we take a completely impartial view of the world.  Our own personal commitments and values do, and should, make a difference to how we should act.<br />&quot;Moral luck&quot; makes several challenging suggestions about the inescapability of the role of good luck in justifying some of our  decisions.  I am tempted to paraphrase one point Williams makes by saying, &quot;The only difference between the genius and the fanatic is that the genius turned out to be right.&quot;<br />&quot;Internal and external reasons&quot; is a technical, but very influential, essay.  Williams notes that a person sometimes has a reason to do something because she has some motivation that will be served by that action (i.e., an internal reason).  He explores whether one can also have a reason to do something when she does not have a motivation that would be served by that action (i.e., an external reason).<br />This is a little abstract.  One non-technical way of getting at the issue Williams is discussing in this essay is this:  Suppose someone doesn't care about morality.  In other words, she has no motivation to act morally.  Does she then have any reason to act morally?<br />Some of these essays are a little technical, and may be hard for the general reader to follow.  However, many may be enjoyed by any bright person, and I think you can walk away with something from all of them.	2000-11-21

It is hard to rate this book.<br />On the one hand, this is about the best statement of the &quot;New Confucianism&quot; that you can get.  New Confucianism is perhaps the most influential contemporary version of Confucianism in &quot;greater China&quot; and even in the U.S.  It seeks to preserve Confucianism, while being open to much of Western science, democracy and capitalism.  This is certainly a worthwhile goal.  And Liu does a nice job setting out the New Confucian perspective on the history of Confucianism, and addresses some of the problems such a position must face.<br />On the other hand, I think the New Confucian view of history is flawed.  New Confucians tend to accept too much of the Song and Ming dynasty interpretations of Confucianism, which are themselves overly dependent on metaphysical assumptions they get from Buddhism (a philosophy and religion that came to China long after Confucius himself died).<br />In addition, New Confucianism is sometimes prone to obscurantism.  Confucius and his early followers can be obscure to us, but that is largely because they lived in an Iron Age culture, while we live in a Computer Age culture.  We have to work to overcome the intellectual distance that separates us.  However, New Confucianism often seems intrinsically obscure.  I challenge you, for example, to make any sense of what Liu says about &quot;Heaven&quot; being an active principle of creativity.  (Yes, I know it sounds pretty; but what does it mean?  I don't think Confucius himself would have had any patience for such airy abstractions.)<br />So if you want to understand a very influential contemporary Confucian movement, read this book.  If you want to get a better sense for what Confucianism is really about, read something like Philip J. Ivanhoe's _Confucian Moral Self Cultivation_.	2000-11-20

There is good reason for this book being in print after almost twenty years.  It includes some excellent essays on Chuang-tzu, a &quot;Taoist,&quot; and one of the greatest philosophers and literary stylists in Chinese history.<br />Chuang-tzu is perhaps best known for his anecdote of how he dreamed that he was a butterfly and awoke from the dream, unsure of whether he was a man who had dreamed that he was a butterfly, or a butterfly who was now dreaming that he was a man.  Also famous is his story of the butcher whose skillful dismembering of an ox is, surprisingly, a model for how we should lead our lives.<br />Chuang-tzu is always a delight to read, but it is also a great challenge to try to figure out what he is trying to communicate to us (if anything!).  The essays in this anthology are &quot;experimental&quot; in that they explore the writings of Chuang-tzu from a variety of perspectives.  Especially worthy of note are the essays by A.C Graham, Chad Hansen, and Lee Yearley.  Graham argues that Chuang-tzu gives us a way for dealing with the troubling gap between &quot;is&quot; and &quot;ought&quot; (between the way things are and the way they ought to be).  Hansen argues that Chuang-tzu is a relativist, for whom there is no objective truth.  Yearley suggests that we see two different images of the &quot;perfected person&quot; in Chuang-tzu.  One is a person who is much like the rest of us, except that she takes less seriously the commitments that make most of us so prone to suffering.  The more radical vision is that of a strange, alien sage, who could look on the death of his own wife as an interesting aspect of the great spectacle of change.  The other essays in this collection offer many other interesting suggestions and perspectives.<br />Good translations of the writings of Chuang-tzu (also written &quot;Chuang Tzu&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;) include those by Burton Watson (who wrote the Foreward to this anthology) and Victor Mair.  Another excellent (and more recent) anthology of essays on Chuang-tzu was edited by Philip J. Ivanhoe and Paul Kjellberg.t (and more recent) anthology of essays on Chuang-tzu was edited by Philip J.

Ivanhoe provides a readable and reliable overview of some of the major figures in Confucianism from over 2,500 years.  Each Confucian is discussed in terms of two themes:  the relative emphasis he gives to study and reflection, and his conception of human nature.  Confucius himself was somewhat ambiguous on these points (leading to much dispute among later followers).  Mencius, since he believed that human nature is good, said that reflection on our innate instincts could provide us with ethical guidance.  Xunzi disagreed with Mencius, arguing that human nature is bad, so we must study to reform our nature.  Later Confucians like Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming were deeply influenced by the Buddhist notion of a transpersonal self that all humans share.  However, Zhu Xi thought that our selfish desires heavily obscured our good, original nature, so we must study in order to better understand our own nature.  In contrast, Wang Yangming, while recognizing the danger of selfish desires, warned against the dangers of purely academic study.  He held that each of us has, prior to study, the ability to exercise a &quot;pure knowing,&quot; through which we both know the good and will act in accordance with it.<br />I use this book a lot in my classes:  I recommend it highly.<br />(This book is a revised version of a much more expensive hardback edition published by Peter Lang.)	2000-11-20

Hampshire explains how an ethic like Aristotle's can be rational, without being scientific.  He then turns to Spinoza, whose exploration of the concept(s) of freedom is characteristic of post-Aristotelian, modern thought.<br />I think the general reader will find these essays challenging but  accessible.

Derk Bodde, a noted Sinologist in his own right, did an excellent job of translating the work into English.  (This was no small feat, since Fung quotes from a variety of works from over two thousand years of Chinese history -- works often written in quite different styles of Classical Chinese.)<br />Fung Yu-lan was one of the most important Chinese philosophers and historians of philosophy of the 20th century.  This book (along with volume two) has introduced generations of scholars and general readers to Chinese philosophers, and is justly considered a classic.  However, it is now very much out of date.  Furthermore, Fung studied in the U.S., and this influence led him to read a sort of Platonism back into some Chinese philosophical texts.<br />Any informed scholar should have a copy of this (in English and in Chinese), but the general reader would be better off reading Benjamin Schwartz's _The World of Thought in Ancient China_ or A.C.

He gives three arguments in support of this claim.  He argues that the best explanation for the diversity of ethical beliefs is that there is no matter of fact that some of us are getting right, while others are getting it wrong.  He argues that the very existence of objective values is &quot;queer&quot; (by which he means &quot;weird&quot;), because they would have to have some strange sort of &quot;intrinsic prescriptivity.&quot;  And he argues that knowledge of objective values, if there were any, would require some strange, inexplicable form of moral intuition.<br />I personally am unconvinced by Mackie's arguments.  For example, why should our ethical disagreements lead us to believe that there are no ethical facts?  People disagree about lots of things that are objective if anything is (e.g., whether UFO's are space aliens).  However, this is clearly one of the paradigmatic statements and defenses of &quot;moral anti-realism.&quot;<br />For an alternative perspective to Mackie's, one might read Thomas Nagel's _The View from Nowhere_ (especially the chapters on ethics and value), or Alasdair MacIntyre's _After Virtue_.	2000-11-15
US	52852809	R3RDQDF5RDL69F	0691019649	388588175	A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy	Books	3	26	29	N	N	A useful, but often problematic, anthology.	We owe a great debt to the late Professor Chan for having translated this anthology of selections from over 2,500 years of Chinese philosophy.  To my knowledge, this is the only anthology that gives so many selections from so many different periods in Chinese history.  Perhaps there never will be a book like this again, at least by one scholar, because I doubt anyone else is competent to translate so many texts from so many different periods.<br />That being said, this book also has serious limitations.  Arbuckle's review (which is nearby) expertly identifies many of them.  Here are some more.  Chan's English is much better than my modern Chinese, but he still sometimes lapses into incoherence.  With a few exceptions, his comments on the translations are both confusing and confused.  Chan likes to use Western philosophical terminology, but he is not in command of it.  It is neither accurate nor helpful to describe the Ch'eng-Chu wing of Neo-Confucianism as &quot;rationalistic,&quot; and the Lu-Wang wing as &quot;dynamic idealism.&quot;<br />For many of the philosophers that Chan covers, this is still the best source for translations.  This is especially so of later Chinese philosophy.  I know of no better translation of selections from Ch'eng Yi and Ch'eng Hao, for example.  But for many other philosophers, you would be better off with translations with a more narrow focus.  Daniel Gardner's _Learning to Be a Sage_ is a great source on Chu Hsi.  And I would (not surprisingly) recommend the anthology I co-edited for translations from ancient Chinese philosophers.  (D.C. Lau, Victor Mair, and Burton Watson have also produced more extensive translations of major early Chinese philosophers.  Look up their names here on amazon.com.)	2000-11-15

For too long there has been no up-to-date, general historical introduction to ancient China.  This book remedies that deficiency, and does so in a wonderful way!<br /><br />The book is topically organized, with each chapter written by a leading scholar on that topic.  The list of contributors reads like a \\"Who's Who\\" of contemporary Sinology:  K.C. Chang on Chinese \\"pre-history\\"; David Keightley on the Shang Dynasty; Hsu Cho-yun on the Spring and Autumn Period; Mark Lewis on the Warring States Period; David S. Nivison (see his _The Ways of Confucianism_) on ancient Chinese philosophy, etc.<br /><br />The general reader should be warned that the scholarship here is  sometimes a little intimidating.  However, careful reading will be well repaid.  As you can see, the price is a real problem.  Perhaps it will come out in paperback some day, but I wouldn't count on it happening any time soon.<br /><br />If you are seriously interested in ancient China, hock your wedding ring and buy this book!	2000-11-13

It is actually one of a two-volume set.  Volume 1 covers the Old Testament; volume 2 covers the New.  (It is hard to tell this from the amazon.com entries for the two volumes, which have the same title, and differ only in the miniscule volume number listed with the ISBN information.  However, if you click on &quot;larger image&quot; you can see the cover of each book identifies its topic.)<br />The perspective of the commentary is moderaterly conservative Christian.  (The commentators exert a lot of energy at some points in trying to explain how the Bible could be historically accurate throughout.)  However, even more liberal interpreters will find the scholarship impressive.  Sometimes there is so much information that it is almost daunting, but you can read selectively (of course).  Pictures are included where relevant (e.g., a reconstruction of what the Ark of the Covenant may have looked like).<br />I have enjoyed consulting volume 1, and learned a lot from it; on that basis, I am buying volume 2 now.	2000-09-28

The writings of the 4th century B.C. &quot;Taoist&quot; Zhaungzi  (Chuang-tzu) are among the great classics of world literature and  philosophy.  They are also very difficult to understand.  What are we to  learn from the story of the cicada, dove and quail that laugh at the huge  Peng bird?  How does a butcher cutting up an ox teach us to lead our lives?  What did Zhuangzi learn when he awoke from a dream, unsure whether he was  Zhuangzi, who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly who is now  dreaming that he is Zhuangzi?<br /><br />This collection of essays represents a  variety of approaches and perspectives.  Some papers compare Zhuangzi to  other philosophers (including Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Nagarjuna, and  Derrida); several discuss Zhuangzi's views on language and skillful  activity; and most take stands on previous debates (e.g., is Zhuangzi a  mystic, skeptic, or relativist)?  At the end of the volume there is an  extensive bibliography of works about Zhuangzi.<br /><br />I have used this text  with talented undergraduates, who have found the essays readable and  informative.  Specialists like myself will also find much of  value.<br /><br />The only comparable collection is Victor Mair's Experimental  Essays on Chuang-tzu, which includes important papers by A.C. Graham, Chad  Hansen, and Lee Yearley.  (The Kjellberg/Ivanhoe volume includes a new  essay by Yearley, and a critique of Hansen's earlier work.)	1998-09-29

This is one of the best translations of the writings attributed to the brilliant Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu.  Although less well known outside of China than &quot;Lao Tzu,&quot; the reputed author of the _Tao Te Ching_, Chuang Tzu, who lived in the 4th century B.C., is both one of history's greatest anti-rationalist philosophers and one of the best prose stylist of world literature.  Among the most famous (and moving) passages in his eponymous work is the story of how Chuang Tzu (whose full name is Chuang Chou) dreamed he was a butterfly, and, upon awakening, &quot;does not know whether he is Chou who dreams he is a butterfly or a butterfly who dreams he is Chou.&quot;<br /> Graham gives a complete translation of the &quot;Inner Chapters,&quot; which are regarded by many scholars as the authentic works of Chuang Tzu, and also gives selections from later Taoist works, attributed to Chuang Tzu (but probably from other philosophers).  Graham's interpretive Introduction (with sections on such tasty topics as &quot;Rejection of Logic&quot; and &quot;Death and Mutilation&quot;) is itself one of the classic interpretations of Chuang Tzu's philosophy.<br /> Readers familiar with the _Chuang Tzu_ from other translations will notice that Graham has rearranged some sections of the text.  This is not mere whim on Graham's part, but part of his thoughtful view that parts of the text have been moved from their original locations due to textual corruption as the book was recopied by generations of scribes.<br /> As you can see, this book is currently out of print (which is a testament to both the poor taste of much of the book-buying public, and to the near-sightedness of publishers).  I sincerely hope that some publisher will pick up the rights to this outstanding translation.<br /> Other excellent translations of the _Chuang Tzu_ include those by Burton Watson, _Chuang Tzu:  Basic Writings_, and Victor Mair, _Wandering on the Way_.  Two fine collections of interpretive essays on Chuang Tzu's thought are Paul Kjellberg and Philip J. Ivanhoe, eds., _Essays on Skepticism, Relativism, and Ethics in the Zhuangzi_, and Victor Mair, ed., _Experimental Essays on Chuang-tzu_.etive essays on Chuang Tzu's thought are Paul Kjellberg and Philip J.
