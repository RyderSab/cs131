Cass has left the brownstone building which holds the finalists after her struggle with bulimia, and the other seven finalists are working harder than ever. Daria is, as usual, looking for oppourtunities to kick other girls out of the running. Hannah is concerned that her friends will find out that she isn't the rich girl they all think she is.

The book opens at a great spot - it's the six finalists' last night before the choosing of the four final girls - the ones which will form the new pop group No Secrets. The answers are revealed the next morning, and I'm not going to say who was chosen since you may not have read this book yet, but their first concert, arguments over a song, and first European tour are well chronicled in this emotional, fast-paced conclusion to the series.	2001-08-22

Georgia's entertaining, well-timed, and often extremely hilarious thoughts make up this lively and unusual book. Though it has plenty of English slang, it comes with a helpful glossary at the back. This book will have readers wanting to read more about Georgia - good thing there's a sequel!	2001-08-01

Though it started out rather predictably, there are so many spontaneous twists in the story and hilarious characters that it's hard to tell what will come next! ALA Booklist says this book is, &quot;like reading a note from your best friend,&quot; and I certainly agree. This was very lively and hard to put down.	2001-08-01

However, with some coaching from her international friends, the Cyber.kdz, Becky decides that someone tampered with the grades database.

I, among many others, stopped reading the series after book 31 when I got fed up with it - nothing at all was happening and the violence was getting to be a bit much. However, after reading the cover copy and a bit inside of this one, I decided it might be worth it and got it. Sure enough, I was very pleased that K.A.

This is an excellent novel chronicling the lives of ten possible candidates for the first eight-girl cut of a new band called No Secrets, which a talent agent named Eileen has come to the girls' school to form.

This is an amazing book - the story, the detail, and the events are written so well that this book is impossible to stop reading once the reader starts it. I wasn't exactly sure if I'd ever get around to reading it - but when I started reading the first words I couldn't stop reading at all until I got to the end. Alphin clearly explores the relationships of an unusual situation, leading up to a fantastic climax that will have all the readers cheering for Cameron. This is most definitely on my Top Three list; it was incredible.	2001-06-12

Only one last name is revealed and that is Jake's. The battle scenes in this book are so much different than in the others...and some of the characters aren't acting like themselves. There are some odd scenes and the conclusion of this book - of the entire series - leaves you hanging in the middle of a battle, then comes an apology note from the author about leaving us hanging and a note to read her new series. It's clear she just did that to get more people to read her other series. No, I wouldn't recommend buying it - but borrow it from a friend or the library and see how you like it because it is most surprising in many areas.	2001-06-06

This book seemed to be a good sequel at first - until I read a certain section in the back which had gory violence that I, a fourteen year old! could barely handle. I mean, I went to the bathroom after reading the end and just stood there crying because it scared me so badly. Now, I'm not expecting everyone to have the same reaction - I'm sure many people my age could easily handle it, no doubt - but this is just a warning to eager kids who haven't read it and parents who want to read it aloud to their kids - it is definitely not for all who enjoyed the first book.	2001-06-06

When an author's series is in such high demand that he/she is made to write one book per month, most of the time, it is extremely hard to handle and keep track of. The author's talent is often wasted. Think of a rubber band stretched to the limit. I am very surprised that K.A. Applegate's rubber band hasn't snapped yet, especially with her other series, Everworld also out once a month! I know she is a talented writer, but hey, Scholastic should give her a break and then the Animorphs books past number ten would be just as good as the first, best ten books which I thouroughly enjoyed.	2001-03-07

Torey Hayden spent five months helping Sheila, whom she discovered to have an IQ of 180. With Torey's excellent work, Sheila was able to go onto regular grade three the next year in the care of a friend of Torey's. In this book, Torey talks about meeting Sheila again after seven years, meeting her at age thirteen. It is a surprising, thoughtful, emotional story, and I highly recommend it as well as its prequel.	2001-03-07

In this collection, children talked about the Harry Potter books. Unfortunately, the entire first half of this book was endless reviews of the books, many of which were wrong and/or repititious. I was bored out of my mind by these reviews, which told the storyline but not what the children enjoyed about the books, and HELLO, we already KNOW the storylines, right? The last part was some letters and recipes and other things, and overall the title &quot;We love Harry Potter; WE'LL TELL YOU WHY&quot; is completely false.

It tells the story of Ivy, a young orphan who doesn't want to be transferred to an Infants' Home so gets off at the station where she pretends her grandmother lives. What follows is a touching chain of events, and I have been looking around for a copy of this story. Note: This copy in particular has excellent new paintings and is reecommended highly as well.	2001-03-03

In this book, a girl from the present (it says 1993 in the book but that's when it was published, so it's the present, basically) travels back in time to the 1920s and occupies the mind of a girl named Lila who sings with a choir.

He runs into awkward moments, memorable moments, and, best of all, hilarious moments. Bryson has a way of describing funny incidents so that one laughs hard. For instance, he describes that after one party one night back on the 1970s trip, his friend got back, stumbled in, and &quot;urinated in the wastebasket [thinking it was the sink]&quot; Bryson could have used simpler words, but this line, if spoken, would probably be in a completely serious tone, either actually serious or faking it. Either way, this 'serious tone' line describing a hilarious instance makes it even more funny. Another thing that makes this book especially funny is the way Bryson talks to the audience. One example of this is when he is talking about one country sending out men to fight in the war. He says, &quot;they sent out eighty men, and, -you're going to like this- they came back with eighty-one, because they made a friend&quot; These qualities plus Bryson's funny descriptive style create an outstanding, hilarious travel book which I like a lot!	2001-01-31

It tells the tale of how Sheila, an abused, neglected child, is put in teacher Torey Hayden's class only because the hospital doesn't have room yet. Torey first feels frustrated then comes to know Sheila and shows her how to deal with all her extreme emotions. This book was so well written I cried at points, and it was definitely the most emotional book I have ever read. Now, when I compare it to my favourite book, my favourite book seems wimpy. Perhaps this is indeed my new favourite. It was absolutely amazing. Torey Hayden is a remarkable person and a wonderful writer as well. I am looking forward to writing the sequel.	2001-01-28

It is, all at the same time, funny, emotional, extremely realistic, and very easy to read because of its proximity to real life. The characters are realistic, likeable, believable, and easy to imagine. Also, the situations in this book seem like real life, and not even close to something out of a repititious high school series.	2001-01-07

However, Mrs.  Cohen has already talked to Donna about the letter and now it's up to Heather to decide if she wants to meet her birth mother.

Ever since she heard about the mysterious disappearance of her older sister, Emma, from her carriage outside a dress shop two years before she was born, Kate has been fantasizing about meeting her perfect older sister.

The girl is not at all what she imagined Emma to be, and no one is really sure if it is Emma.
