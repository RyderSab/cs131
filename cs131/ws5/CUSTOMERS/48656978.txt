Said to be given by Odin, Father of the Norse Gods, they represent a clear picture of the heroic ethics, home life and warrior code of the Viking Period (c790 AD-c1070 AD).<br />Seek swiftness from a ship, protection from a shield, cuts from a sword kisses from a maiden.<br />Although the words Hávámál are attributed to Odin, there is no mention of life after death, of religious belief, or of faith in gods. The advice is very practical and applies to the everyday life of the \\"average\\" Viking.<br />With half a loaf and a cup of ale, I have found many a friend.<br />Friendship is another important aspect of the Hávámál. A man often placed his life in the hands of his comrades, and he needed to be certain of their loyalty. Therefore, gold was not given to the son to inherit, but spent freely by friends. The penalty for betrayal was death, and vengeance was the noble course of action.   Wisdom is worth more than gold or an unknown path.<br />Ultimately, these proverbs paint a picture of the ideal Viking: he must be open, friendly and generous; he must be wise - but not too wise - he must keep his wits about him and be ready for a fight; he must hold honor high and be loyal to his friends and kin. In short, he must be the perfect hero.	2000-11-20

City of My Dreams, the first book in Per Anders Folgelström's  five-volume Stockholm Series, broke the Swedish record for best sellers. A compelling storyteller known for his narrative sweep, his acute characterization and the poetic qualities of his prose, Fogelström was highly acclaimed even before he wrote the series. Ingmar Bergman made one of his earlier novels, Summer with Monika, into a film that is now a classic.<br />After reading his series in Swedish, Jennifer Brown Bäverstam, an accomplished translator of Swedish and French, married to a Swede, she vowed to make these books available in English. The skill of both author and translator brings into English this superb telling of the tale of Henning Nilsson and his family, a family whose origins and growth in the underclass of nineteenth century Stockholm mirrors the growth of Stockholm itself into a modern European metropolis. Beginning with the arrival in the city of fifteen-year-old Henning, barefoot and penniless, on the eve of the industrial revolution, it continues with the story of an impassioned struggle for a fully human life. Powerfully written, City of My Dreams sweeps the reader along in a historic saga of fortune, love, and acceptance of the existing order of things in a society experiencing great social and political upheaval. Clearly a masterpiece of historical realism, this novel transports the reader into the inexorable drama of another person's life. A favorite among Swedish readers of all ages, this translation is a welcome gift to English readers.	2000-11-20

Sweden's rich literary heritage is full of homespun philosophy, simple truths, bits of collective wisdom, and good old common sense. Scholars define a proverb as \\"a short wise saying used for a long time by many people.\\" The Swedes put it another way, \\"a proverb says what all men think.\\"<br />The Swedish people love beauty, and even their most practical, everyday items are works of art. So, too, are their proverbs. The illustrations for this book come from early twentieth-century travel guides to Sweden, and beautifully accompany these traditional words of wisdom and advice.<br />So enjoy these pithy statements from a centuries-old culture, and perhaps you will find that the wisdom of our ancestors still speaks to us today.<br />Some exapmles of Swedish Proverbs:<br />\\"Even the smallest of stars shines in the darkness.\\"<br />\\"What is hidden in snow comes forth in the thaw.\\"<br />\\"We should remember to think well and speak well of one another.\\"<br />\\"A wound never heals enough to hide the scar.\\"<br />\\"Better to suffer for the truth than to be praised for lies.\\"	2000-11-20

Baskets are more than a hobby to Joanna E. Schanz; they're a  way of life. The Iowa native apprenticed with one of the last old-time basketmakers. Her baskets have garnered her a regional and a growing national reputation.<br />Joanna divides her time between basketry and running several family-owned businesses (including furniture and refinishing shops) with her husband Norman. The traditional willow basketry of the Amana Colonies, where Joanna and her family make their home, is the biggest inspiration behind Joanna's work, but she also experiments with new materials and methods of basketmaking. Lecturing and demonstrating basketry techniques at conventions and art fairs are among Joanna's many craft activities.<br />Her book covers the history of basketmaking in the Amana Colonies with examples shown of the historic baskets. There are about two dozen historic photographs showing baskets in use in the daily lives of the Amana people before the Great Change in 1932. There are no pre-1900 photographs showing the Amana people, let alone their basketry. The elders of the religious community did not at that time approve of photography or the decorative arts.<br />The Amana people did not consider baskets an art form or collectible, but rather a strictly utilitarian necessity. The photographs in this book from the 1900-32 era show that baskets were used extensively as an aid to gardening, field planting, and harvesting, as well as for picnics.<br />Basketmakers of today in the Amana Colonies-Joanna, Laura Kleinmeyer and Kathy Kellenberger-are featured with their willow baskets. Illustrated directions show exactly how to make six baskets. They are the round laundry basket, small oval Easter basket, oval community kitchen basket, strawberry picker, apple-picker and the Amana Colony willow basket.<br />A unique feature of the round basket historically created in the Colonies is the round removable base that can be replaced when worn-a solution of the thrifty German pioneerswho came to the Amanas in the1850s seeking religious freedom.	2000-11-20

Children are pictured walking in the Schulwald (school woods, so named because the trees were planted by school pupils) pine forest. \\"The trees became tall and erect, and they whispered in the wind, and walking beneath their lacy boughs became one of the soft delights of communal Amana.\\" The trees of the Schulwald were felled for lumber, at the request of the United States Government during World War II, but the visual impressions and historic testimony of a people's heritage are preserved in The Amanas Yesterday.<br />Today, the Amana Colonies are Iowa's largest tourist attraction with more than a million visitors annually. Visitors find a heritage preserved in the museums, former communal kitchens and living quarters, furniture factories, woolen mill, family-style restaurants, unique stores and shops, traditional meat processing plants and bakeries, wineries, industriously farmed land and a major industry in the nationally successful Amana Refrigeration Plant.	2000-11-20

The cultures of these groups have a complex history of intertwining language, national identity, social customs and beliefs.  And, while cuisines and recipes differ from culture to culture, and even, as we know, from person to person within a family, the similarities between them merit their commingling in this little book. <br />Slavic food is hearty food with healthy ingredients, featuring noodles, cooked vegetables, potatoes, meat, sauerkraut, and fruit.

In the words of Grant Wood, \\"Any northern town old enough to have some buildings dating back to the Civil War is liable to have a house or church in the American Gothic style.  I simply invented some American Gothic people to stand in front of a house of this type.\\" In fact, he used his sister Nan Wood Graham and his dentist Dr. Byron McKeeby as models for the 1930 painting.  Mrs. McKeeby's recipe for pie crust is included.<br />These are recipes for honest, hard-working, Midwestern fare. There are also lots of picnic dishes.  Grant Wood loved a picnic.

His lifelong Finnishness and attention to language, not to mention a penchant for puns and the good sense to laugh at himself, put him squarely in the tradition of Finnish-American humor, a tradition unknown only to those poor souls  without Finnish relatives or friends. In the first section of the book, Hillila argues that \\"Finns are Fun Folks,\\" supporting this radical notion with ample anecdotal evidence. In the second section, \\"Finnish is a Fun Language,\\" Hillila recounts countless pronunciation bloopers caused when Americans try to speak a language that uses more vowels than consonants, or when Finnish speakers try their hand at talking \\"'merican.\\" The third section, \\"Finglish is Even More Fun,\\" shows how English has entered the Finnish language, not always through the front door. The book is well-written, informative and full of \\"funnies\\" for Finns and non-Finns alike. <br />Bernhard Hillila is currently professor emeritus of education at Valparaiso University. He has served as a pastor of bilinguial Suomi Synod congregations and was president of Suomi College and Theological Seminary in Hancock, Michigan.

From authentic sources, including the Norse folk legends collected by Peter Christian Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, these centuries-old stories of sorcery, monsters and demons come from the imaginations of the Scandinavian people. Nineteen stories reflect the fear of evil that haunts and fascinates the human soul.<br />These ancient tales from Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Finland can be read on many levels: as entertaining stories of magic and mayhem; as fables to warn children to be careful of the hidden dangers of the world; or as symbolic reflections on the eternal struggle of good versus evil and the quest for ultimate power. <br />Sorcery, witchcraft, magic charms and incantations; graveyards and nocturnal journeys; ghosts, monsters, and demons of the night are common elements in these tales of the supernatural. For generations, the Scandinavian peasants huddled around their fires interweaving fantasy and belief based on superstition, religion, social customs and taboos, life styles and morals. The supernatural beings raised in these sittings represent the evil perceived in the heart of mankind and the harsh world beyond the hearth. The telling of undesirable human traits or emotions through witches, goblins, trolls, and other monstrous beings gave rise to the hope that being mindful and alert to these dangers would hold them at bay. <br />In this book, travel a frightening world of curses and maleficence, power and greed tempered by a revelation of the will to overcome.

In \\"Astrid\\" and \\"Sigrid Storräde,\\" a princess and a queen from the still-pagan land of Sweden join with kings from a Christianized Norway at Kungahälla-a site on the coast of western Sweden where the countries negotiated peace, often through marriage. The women are strong-willed, but the men are strong of faith; the drama Lagerlöf imagines between them reveals her romantic fascination with this conflict. \\"The Silver Mine\\" is a later work, and centers on the extravagant 18th-century King Gustav III. On a visit to a small town, this king learns how the parish has come to value peace of mind over material wealth.<br />In 1909, Lagerlöf became the first woman-and the first Swede-to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, and several years later became the first woman inducted into the Swedish Academy. She is an exemplar of humanism, a champion of the world's unfortunates, as well as a captivating storyteller. Unfortunately, with her works out of print for over half a century, her eloquent writing has gone unnoticed by recent generations.

Lagerlöf drew on stories of legendary figures in her rural province in south-central Sweden to weave this epic tapestry of passions, her first major published work.<br />The story revolves around the character of Gösta Berling, who begins the book in despair after drunkenness costs him his post as a country pastor. Through the apparent generosity of the Lady of Ekeby, he falls in with twelve aging \\"cavaliers\\" who live in a separate wing of her manor house. In a turn of events that bears the devil's stamp, the Lady is turned away from Ekeby, giving Gösta Berling and the cavaliers full run of the estate and its mines, provided they remain true to their code to do nothing that is \\"sensible or useful.\\" Let it be said that they succeed in this resolve; whether the community benefits from their mischief is a matter of serious debate.<br />Lagerlöf's masterpiece can be enjoyed on many levels. The setting provides a fresh departure from contemporary life, illustrating a simple country existence. Lagerlöf's treatment of characters ranging from peasantry to nobility satisfies the reader's moral sense, as sympathy is extended toward the dispossessed, a harsh light shone on selfish or calloused souls, and a gentle wit bent on those exhibiting minor follies. The cavaliers provide charming foils to the melodrama of Gösta's love interests; to this is added a profoundly supernatural element. The symbolism recalls the power of pagan rites, as well as the consciously Christian theme of forgiveness, while the premise of the saga recalls the Faust legend.

US	48656978	R2PSKCDL6GGWFB	1572160012	116488357	Invisible Links	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Short Stories of the Swedish People	Selma Lagerlöf (1858-1940) is one of the most well-known literary figures to have come out of Sweden, particularly after she became the first woman to receive the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909. As an avid supporter of causes such as women's rights and world peace, her thoughts and concerns are equally valid today.<br />Invisible Links is the first in a series of reprints of Selma Lagerlöf's works from Penfield Press. This collection of Lagerlöf's earlier short stories depicts the Swedish people, their lives and struggles, through glimpses into their souls. This updated edition is an abridged version of Pauline Bancroft Flach's 1899 translation, except \\"The Epitaph,\\" that was included in the Swedish collection and translated by Jessie Brochner. <br />Selma Lagerlöf's storytelling includes elements of folk legends, fairy tales, and dreams. There are avenging ghosts and ghosts with good advice; there are tragic and happy endings. Her wise, compassionate voice narrates tales that are both dramatic and perplexing.<br />There are lighter stories. \\"Uncle Reuben\\" is a comic fable about the use of family legends to keep children in line. \\"Downie\\" is a love story set in springtime. And \\"Among the Climbing Roses\\" is about the insect friends to be found in the summer garden. Lively and intimate observations of the natural world are woven through all the stories, lending them an authentic beauty. <br />Lagerlöf explores the boundaries between illusion and reality, good and evil, the forces of life and destruction. Her stories do not come up with easy answers. What is certain is that the meanings human beings create, the links-or fetters-connecting them with the world, are nothing less than sacred. In Lagerlöf's fiction, this conviction becomes the lifeblood of the storyteller and reader alike.	2000-11-02

They include ancestral tales passed down by her grandmother and other family raconteurs, and tales from her own childhood in the bustling, hos-pitable household of Mårbacka in the west-central province of Värmland. It also tells the story of a young girl's perseverance in pursuing her dream of becoming an author.<br />Lagerlöf (1858-1940) was devoted to Mårbacka, to her family and to those who worked on the modest rural estate. Several of the stories dramatize her special relationship with her enterprising-if not thrifty-father, whom she eulogized in her Nobel lecture. When she was thirty, teaching schoolchildren in southern Sweden, the family's finances required that they sell the house and surrounding lands. Like a fairy tale come true, the success of Lagerlöf's children's books (The Wonderful Adventures of Nils and The Further Adventures of Nils) enabled her to buy back Mårbacka; then came the Nobel in 1909, enabling her to purchase the land, as well.  The final essay of the collection tells of her almost instinctual yearning to return to her childhood home. Today, Mårbacka remains open to visitors.<br />Selma became partially lame at the age of three, and never completely recovered. This experience deepened her spirituality, her compassion, and her dedication to a life of books. \\"The Ball at Sunne\\" tells the poignant story of her awkwardness as a teenager in the social world. One section of the book is devoted to her diary account of the months she spent in Stockholm, where she underwent physical therapy.<br />Lagerlöf is an exemplar of humanism, a champion of the world's unfortunates, as well as a captivating storyteller. Unfortunately, with her works out of print for over half a century, her eloquent writing has gone unnoticed by recent generations of readers looking for compelling female models. Penfield Press is releasing four reprints of her work this spring,including Invisible Links (short stories), Memories of Mårbacka, Scandinavian Kings and Queens: Three Stories, and Girl from the Marsh Croft and other stories. Penfield Press is also planning to bring out additional works by Selma Lagerlöf. The favorite author of everyone's grandmother, her tales are timeless classics in their themes and expression. This handsomely-bound volume, complete with chronology, notes, line-drawings and photographs, will hold a treasured place on the reader's bookshelf.	2000-11-02

She was a pathfinder whose contributions extend into areas that cannot be easily measured.\\" writes Mary Bennett, Special Collections Coordinator for the State Historical Society of Iowa.<br /> Julie Jensen McDonald pieces together the spirit of the Wood family during the demanding and daring times of the 1920s and 30s, capturing the substance that nurtured the talent, resourcefulness, and fierce loyalty demonstrated by Nan Wood Graham until her death in 1990 at the age of ninety-one years. Intriguing and enchanting details, garnered from the vast collection of Grant Wood memorabilia now held by the Davenport Art Museum, and other sources, profile the woman behind the face in American Gothic. Nan tells how she was wooed by her brother into posing for the painting by a promise that no one would recognize her. As the Gothic couple became one of the most celebrated images in art history,  she speaks candidly of the joy as well as the vulnerability of \\"celebrity,\\" including the innumerable parodies which depict a wide range of social conditions.<br /> Joan Liffring-Zug Bourret, Penfield Press publisher, presents a pictorial documentary along with a\\"Passages in Time\\" of the Wood family, and rare insights from friends, acquaintances and admirers of Nan and her brother Grant Wood.<br /> Essays by friends and close associates reveal the extent of Nan Wood Graham's devotion to the memory of her brother and to the places where they spent their early years. Personal letters and other commentaries provide a view of her fondness for time and place: early years in Anamosa, Iowa, growing up in Cedar Rapids, the generosity of friends in the Amana Colonies in times of great need, and the support of friends and mentors in the Iowa City and Davenport areas.        Nan was often cast as a \\"fierce guardian ofthe truths of her brother's life.\\" The Epilogue \\"Myths About Grant Wood,\\" based on several years of research with Nan and other sources by the late John Zug, presents some truths to dispel many of the myths that often accompany notoriety.<br /> This book adds a dimension to the woman in American Gothic. At age eighty three, Nan said the painting saved her life from being drab. Even though she didn't think the \\"painted\\" lady looked anything like her when it was first displayed, she had now decided that: \\"We look a lot alike. She's really become me.\\"	2000-11-02

Originally commissioned by the Swedish National Teachers' Society to teach introductory geography to young Swedish schoolchildren, these adventures, first published in 1906-1907,  take flight when Nils, a Swedish imp, is magically reduced to elfin size, gets astride a gander who joins a flock of wild geese that fly a route covering the significant geographical and historical sites of all of Sweden. Along the way, they encounter the consequential elements of survival, both socially and environmentally: predator and victim, friend and foe, the land and its users. Told in a series of narratives, these adventures demonstrate this Nobel-prize-winning author's skill at defining the sublime in simple, everyday existence.<br /> Much of Selma Lagerlöf's work is rooted in her childhood experiences at the ancestral home, \\"Mårbacka.\\" In her Memories of Mårbacka, she recounts the flight of one of Mårbacka's ganders who joins a flock of wild geese and returns during the next seasonal migration, proudly bringing new family and friends to share the domestic trough, only to come to a horrific end at the hands of the wicked housekeeper. The emergence of these childhood impressions coupled with adult wisdom suggests the appeal of the adventures of Nils to both children and adults. Life at Mårbacka might be noted as a modest-genteelness, holding casual acquaintance with the nobility and some deference from the peasantry. Family and household staff were a source of entertainment and amusement; the imaginative enchantment of storytelling was a main diversion.<br /> Of the many concerns in these adventures still appropriate today is that of the environment expressed by the wild goose: \\"If you have learned anything at all from us, Thumbietot, you no longer think that the humans should have the whole earth to themselves,\\". . . \\"Remember you have a large country and you can easily afford to leave a few bare rocks, a few shallow lakes and swamps, a few desolate cliffs and remote forests to us poor, dumb creatures, where we can be allowed to live in peace.\\"<br /> This combined edition, from 1917 translations of the two adventures, is sixth in a series of reprints from Penfield Press of the works of Selma Lagerlöf. Others include: Invisible Links, Girl from the Marsh Croft, Memories of Mårbacks, Scandinavian Kings and Queens, and Gösta Berling's Saga. Forthcoming is Words of Love and Wisdom by Selma Lagerlöf, a book of selected excerpts from her major works.	2000-11-01
