It's just a great tropical drink. When I decided that I had had enough of paying $7 for them at restaurants, and that I wanted my own at home, I looked up Trader Vic's recipe. It was okay, but it really was geared more for a sort of \\"Zombie Punch\\" -- where ratios were expressed in fifths (entire bottles) rather than ounces.<br /><br />Later, I happend upon Suzanne Matczuk's Cocktail-o-Matic, which had a much more approachable recipe for Zombies. I began to make those, and was happy.<br /><br />However, this year I spent two weeks on O'ahu. I became totally hooked on the atmosphere (one could say the entire island made a left turn at 1968, and has just sort of \\"lived tiki\\" since), the people, and the drinks and cuisine. So while I was in Hilo Hatties, I picked this book up on a whim.<br /><br />I was totally impressed. Where I thought I would be getting a book full of touristy BS, I got a book with authentic (one of the authors is Donn's widow, these recipes were taken from his belongings) recipes for both drinks and food.<br /><br />The drinks are quite palatable. Many of them (such as Beachcomber's Gold and Rum Barrel) are just classic. A couple are \\"out there\\" (such as Test Pilot), but you can really taste and feel what the author was going for. I feel I must mention the Zombie recipe from this book. Not only is it authentic -- the man invented the drink -- but we learn that it contained Absinthe! Also, that it was prepared at least a couple times with added glycerine. Wow. This explains the drink's somewhat evil reputation.<br /><br />If all you got in this book was the drinks, it would be worth the price. However, you gain priceless insight into the culture, and into Donn himself. Of particular interest was the conversation between Donn and Vic about the Mai Tai. Additionally, the story of his shipping gardenias from hawaii (daily!) and his experience in the Army during WWII.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I'd also recommend the Suzanne Matczuk book, as it is told in the same way (plenty of culture with the drinks), and it is instructional to see the difference in the drinks as she writes them, and the way they were originally... \\"prescribed.\\"so recommend the Suzanne Matczuk book, as it is told in the same way (plenty of culture with the drinks), and it is instructional to see the difference in the drinks as she writes them, and the way they were originally... \\"prescribed.\\"	2004-12-14
US	50387192	R1FVGLHDVKASBE	0345461622	197047472	Pandora's Star	Books	4	3	5	N	Y	Another large volume from Hamilton	So we have yet another very large book by Hamilton. The author says the book will be \\"finished\\" by the next book, which is due out in 2005. If it is roughly as long as this, we should see it finished in 1500 pages instead of the 3000+ pages of the Nights Dawn \\"trilogy\\".<br /><br />I'd like to agree with those who have said that Hamilton seems to have a hard time sticking with the story. There are myriad sub-plots and seemingly unrelated threads throughout the story, which meander through dozens to perhaps a couple hundred pages in total. It makes for slow reading. Now, that having been said, this was also the case with his previous books. Often, one of these seemingly unrelated plot threads became much more important in a later book. But reading on this end about somebody completely unrelated to the rest of the book for ten to forty pages just seems like a waste of time.<br /><br />As for the quality of the story itself, I have mixed feelings. Another reader reported that it seemed similar to Hyperion. Well, I would say that it was much more like Fall of Hyperion, but I think the point is there. Much of the culture seems the same, a loose alliance still comprising a Commonwealth (or Hegemony). Aliens around, but not really playing any major part in anything. The wormhole nonsense (which had amazing similarity to Hyperion's \\"Fatline\\"). You probably also noticed the similarity between the SI and the Techno Core, and the Unisphere and the All Thing. You've also got the Starflyer and the Shrike... I could really go on, the similarities are many.<br /><br />Now, that isn't to say I didn't like the story. It is a very fun story to read, in the way that reading Clive Cussler can be fun to read. If I may make just one more parallel, I find a lot of similarity between Nigel/Ozzie and Cussler's Dirk Pitt. Hamilton doesn't even really try to explain in scientific terms the things he is just casually bringing into the book. If you're not looking for something that's visionary, and are just looking for a suspenseful, dramatic book, he really does a good job.<br /><br />I am somewhat irritated that he can't seem to confine himself to a single volume.<br /><br />Overall, I'd rate the book at 5 stars, except for the fact that the science was weak, and much of the content seems to be simple regurgitation of what is in the SF corpus already. Lack of original content, we'll call it.nary, and are just looking for a suspenseful, dramatic book, he really does a good job. <br /> <br />I am somewhat irritated that he can't seem to confine himself to a single volume. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd rate the book at 5 stars, except for the fact that the science was weak, and much of the content seems to be simple regurgitation of what is in the SF corpus already.

US	50387192	RXZT58FY1LZR6	0441011586	893478005	Absolution Gap	Books	2	70	79	N	Y	Incredibly disappointing.	First, I'd like to mirror what many of the other reviewers have said. Specifically a correlary between Stephen Baxter and Reynolds. He does seem to have a bit of a problem continuing this story.<br /><br />I think what nobody has mentioned here, and bears mentioning, is that Reynolds left his job as a scientist to pursue writing full time to write this book. It seems that perhaps he got a little cocky.<br /><br />Where the previous two books (I disagree that this is a four book series) were cold, realistic, hard science fiction (with the notable, but forgivable exception of Skade's FTL escapades and the cache weapons), his resolve to write concise books simply disappears with the third. Bizarre weapons (\\"hypometric\\" weapons, \\"bladder mines\\", \\"cryo math\\", and so on) and forces peek out and begin to play very large parts in this book.<br /><br />Additionally, characters are spun through very strange trajectories not expected from the previous books. Scorpio is nearly a different character entirely. Brannigan is, well, a person again. Khouri is almost maternal, and rather boring. Clavain is near useless, and certainly uninteresting, and Skade is implausible(er) and not nearly as formidable.<br /><br />What happened? I don't think anyone but Reynolds can really answer this. As somebody who went to amazon.co.uk to get copies of his books which were unavailable here in the US, I am definitely somebody who is a fan of his. After reading this, however, I'm not sure I'd read another of his books. My hope is that he will realize from the vast majority of reviews of his recent book, that he has taken a turn that was unexpected, and that perhaps he should reconsider.<br /><br />At any rate, I would also suggest buying as a paperback. Or borrowing. This isn't worth the cost of admission, and it really wasn't worth the time I spent reading it. The suspense at the end of the book (a paltry 60-80 pages) is roughly the same quality as the middle to end of the second book, but is completely blunted by a weak, anticlimactic ending. This series needed a solid ending, regardless of whether it was a lead in to another book. What we have here is loose ends gummed up, rather than sewn up.<br /><br />Suggested for hardcore fans who have to know, recommend against it for anyone else.but is completely blunted by a weak, anticlimactic ending.

That brings up an issue of mine with the book, however. The author refers to things by their western name, and only occasionally by their proper name. Gulab Jamun, then, is called \\"deep fried milk pastries\\" in the book. It sort of loses its authenticity this way. Additionally, I have yet to visit an indian restaurant which has their menu in english. And not for lack of trying, really. We do indian a lot. This means, though, that if you're looking for your favorite indian dish from a restaurant, you may be stuck reading through the book finding a recipe that seems like it's the one you like.<br /><br />The other issue I have with it is it appears that there was very little quality assurance involved with this book. The recipes, it seem, have all the ingredients listed to the left. However, as you begin to go through the recipe, you will find that some of the ingredients listed are simply not used in the recipe. This is not because they aren't used, I think, but because the author simply forgot to include them.<br /><br />I think most cooks however, can overcome that. The pictures, as others have mentioned, are very nice. The paper is also very nice. Perhaps not something you'd really want to have in the kitchen (for fear of damaging it), but nonetheless would make a great addition to a library in general.<br /><br />The quality of the recipes themselves is also up for subjective interpretation. Most indian food (per tihs book) is not particularly complicated. There's a lot of ginger, coriander, cardamom, turmeric, and lemongrass involved. Generally this is pureed, added to an ingredient, and then it is either made into a soup (such as the halibut soup early on in the book), or into a grilled item (such as the tandoori chicken later in the book). The recipes themselves are very short. Often four paragraphs of 2-3 sentences each. \\"combine these four ingredients, puree, set aside. combine another four ingredients, prepare, then add previous four ingredients and cook on high heat in a wok.\\" It is certainly very possible to cook with such recipes, but not customary by the cookbooks (of many cuisines) we are accustomed to. I think this may also be part of the omissions mentioned above.<br /><br />The food tastes fine. It is definitely indian, but has a very strong thai influence, it seems. With all the ginger and lemongrass, that's not hard to understand.<br /><br />I am generally happy with my purchase, but might go for a more traditional black-ink-on-white-paper book if I were to consider buying another indian cookbook.redients, puree, set aside. combine another four ingredients, prepare, then add previous four ingredients and cook on high heat in a wok.\\" It is certainly very possible to cook with such recipes, but not customary by the cookbooks (of many cuisines) we are accustomed to.

This book offers literally dozens of hikes throughout the Shenandoah National Park. We bought it -- at Shenandoah -- for that exact reason. We had gone out casually hiking on our own, without guides, and wanted book so that we could plan hikes better, and hike to some of the falls in the park.<br />Our first foray into the Shenandoah with the book as our guide was to Rose River Falls, pp. 86. This is a 4 mile, moderate hike, in a loop. Essentially, you drive to mile 49, park, cross the street, and walk a mile or so, and there the loop is for you to hike.<br />Or so the book says. It turns out that this is not the case at all. It describes a sharp right at a blue blaze. The first blue blaze, which is on your right, is also a right turn. It is not the correct right turn. In fact, it takes you to Shenandoah's Dark Falls, which are very popular. However, they also constitute -- only the trip up, mind you, which is where this inaccuracy deposits you -- a 'strenuous' hike. We hike one weekend a month, sometimes 3 weekends a month. We live in the area.<br />Our second foray, again using the book, was this time much better prepared. I brought with us a pedometer and a compass. We calibrated them before leaving, and set out on our hike. This time was for the Hawksbill Summit (pp. 84). Drive to mile 46, park, walk 100 yards, make a left at the white slashes, and proceed along the AT through the loop.<br />This did not happen. As it turns out, we hiked a full thousand feet (that is, 333 yards), and did not see a single white blaze. Nor a single white slash. We walked back down the path, and had a look. We had not, I am sad to say, missed anything. There are no slashes within a thousand feet of the road. There is no fork to the left, to the right, or anything. As it turns out, this time, we were presented with a sign from the park service. The turn on to the Hawksbill trail is .4 miles from the road. That's twice what we walked, 2,000 feet. Somehow the author of the book managed to confuse &quot;100 yards&quot; and &quot;700 yards&quot;.<br />This is simply inexcusable. Hikers can get (and do get, as it turns out) lost due to this horrendously inaccurate information. I'm not sure what the other reviewers were hiking, but our luck (0 for 2) has been abysmal. We're getting another guide, and we're not going to trust that one without a GPS.<br />Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.<br />Two stars given because it does include almost every trail in the park -- you'll just have to get another book if you want to hike them.d to confuse &quot;100 yards&quot; and &quot;700 yards&quot;. <br />This is simply inexcusable.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked this book up, but was looking for a change of pace. Unlike most of the readers here, I haven't actually read the other book of hers. It was simply something different.<br />So the book starts off rather charming. People wandering around Africa (Zambia, I suppose) and just describing the absurdity of the condition. Describing the landscape and the people. I enjoyed that. A refreshing change.<br />As it continues, we actually begin to notice ... what aren't really flaws in the Author's character so much as, well, as the Amazon reviewer put it, craters. You start to see that both the people (K and the Author) are fairly scarred and unhappy people.<br />This goes on, and the unhappiness really increases substantially. I found the book to have gone from charming and lighthearted to depressing and rather bleak. This, perhaps intentionally, seems to coincide with the landscape. We start off in Zambia at the downright comical parents' fish farm, and continue to a somewhat bleaker K's home, and then back to the States, thoroughly unhappy and indeed missing everything in Africa, and then it gets really unpleasant -- lost in the African outback, being chased by a pet Lion (!), and so on.<br />So while it might be hard to finish, as the change is so drastic (although mercifully slow), like other art, it is sometimes painful, and we as readers are compelled to do so.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, there just isn't a hollywood ending. It ends. There isn't anything tied up or completed, the threads of the book remain, sadly, frayed. That, however, I suppose, is the Author's point.<br />I'd been trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars for the book, and erred on the side of 4. I'd probably read it again, but I'd make sure to do it at a time when I wasn't looking for anything pleasant or uplifting.	2004-07-16
US	50387192	R3MHZSVUAGINCS	0739302345	532522277	Darwin's Children	Books	1	3	5	N	N	Just plain terrible.	I read the first book. Like, read it, on paper. I enjoyed it. So, on a whim, I picked up the sequel to Darwin's Radio on the iTunes Music Store. Boy, it was just awful.<br />First off, the person reading the book is trying way too hard to do all kinds of voices -- latina women, black women, old men, old women, young girls -- and detracts entirely from the flow of the book. It's very difficult to be paying attention to the book itself when the narrator keeps speaking in tongues.<br />As for the book itself, the plot is much more like a romance novel. Thin, lacking detail. Plot devices are cliche and predictable. About half an hour into this book, I knew exactly what was going to happen, simply by the way the author laid things out.<br />It seems to me that the ending of the first book left a lot open. Sometimes, that's a good thing. It leaves the reader to chew on what the author is trying to convey. It allows open-ended thought on the subject. In the case of Darwin's Radio, this is definitely a good thing.<br />However, it also seems that this book was some compulsory thing Mr. Bear did because there was .. I dunno, need from his readerbase to \\"finish the story\\"? This is clearly the work of small minds. To take these characters off into all these spurious thread-cleaning-up adventures at the expense of the reader's time and money is just criminal.<br />Sometimes, well enough is well enough alone.<br />If you must read this book, borrow the paper copy. The audiobook is not worth the time or money, and the book isn't either. At least the paper won't be attempting some inflected southern accent.	2004-02-22

A lot of fanciful fluff without a lot of meaning or purpose to it.<br />Stephen Baxter treads a thin line between fluff and hard science fiction. This isn't because he hasn't read up on what he's talking about, but rather because his science fiction is just *so hard* that it seems at some points implausible. The science of it didn't really impress me, I read a lot of scientific text. The fact that he wrapped all those concepts up into one book, and then leapt off the cliff with them impressed me.<br />He has quite an imagination, and wields it impressively. The one thing you might not like about this book is his somewhat peculiar plot trajectory. He sort of starts off slow (the aforementioned &quot;bait and switch&quot;), and then more or less gives the book away right about in the middle, and then it lulls down to this seeming end in futility. At that point it's almost like he starts a new book and begins talking about new ideas, to end in a somewhat ... awkward ending.<br />This isn't to say that the book leaves you feeling cheated or anything. What I got most out of this book was a deep appreciation for how much work he put in to it. It really was a fulfilling book.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-07-01

This book just gets better and better as you read it.<br />It starts somewhat slow, as most of Cherryh's books do. I would contend, however, that it only _seems_ slow as you begin to recognize the characters and the plot lines.<br />Cherryh leaves us with an incredibly complex book. The complexity of the book is not in the characters, nor in the plot itself. Rather, she has woven perhaps one of the most complex societies and man:man, man:environment conflicts I've ever read.<br />The continuing question throughout the book is debated by people removed from the situation (I won't go in to details for the sake of the prospective readers), and new details come to life as the story progresses.<br />What really makes this book a shining example of what a good author can do is Cherryh's creation, quite literally of the ground up, of a new race. A new society. And describing that race, and that society, at every step of the way. Not only does she create conflict and strong interactions between characters and groups of characters, but she creates a new morality, a new language, and indeed a new culture.<br />This book shows the talent of one of Science Fiction's most gifted authors. Highly, highly recommended. I buy this book for anyone who will read it.	2003-06-17

I'd mostly go along with it. 4 stars seems to be too much, while 3 is overly harsh.<br />The UK version of _Consider Phlebas_ and _Look to Windward_ were published with near identical covers. I think that should really be the first insight into these books. First, Consider Phlebas is Banks' first science fiction book. Kudos to him for writing such an excellent book. However, it is necessary to judge an author's work by his other work when one delves into the class of Iain Banks or, say, CJ Cherryh.<br />To say that this is an excellent book would not necessarily be incorrect. When compared to something of, say, Paul Levinson's, one should be stunned by how confident Banks is. His prose is concise and calculating -- and yet entirely engaging and only sporadically dry. Alas, Consider Phlebas falls down when compared to Look to Windward or Excession.<br />In Consider Phlebas, we have Banks' typical deep character development: deeply conflicted, gregarious, and typically not-so-nice protagonists, on missions to do things we might not agree with. As usual, we find ourselves more and more identifying with characters he never fails to kill, seemingly without reason. But in Consider Phlebas, the reader will sometimes find themselves asking, \\"why on earth did he write these two chapters? what was he getting at?\\"<br />This is not to say that he isn't making a point. Or that the book makes no sense. It does. There is a well defined plot trajectory, well defined \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\", (although you may change your opinion on which is which throughout the book) an engrossing climax, and so on. However, he just doesn't do it as well as he does in some of his later books.<br />I'd definitely recommend it for the avid Banks enthusiast, but for a casual reader, please do yourself a favor and pick up _Excession_ or _Look to Windward_.	2003-06-17
US	50387192	RBB6WJCNMBUIX	0743421922	549137614	Look to Windward	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	Spectacular banks novel	This would be a good introduction to Iain Banks, if you're new to his books. Probably this and Excession are his two most accessible books.<br />The book starts with the description of an Orbital. Orbitals are rings (see Freeman Dyson), millions of kilometers in circumference, which orbit a sun. The surface area of these habitats are gigantic. Think populations in the billions. As Banks describes this majestic Orbital, we begin to learn more about the people on it, and the background of the Idiran war (see _Consider Phlebas_, also by Banks).<br />The core values of Banks are here: Betrayal, Protagonists you really wish you didn't like, Death (lots of it), the Culture and its Minds, and high and hard science fiction.<br />Perhaps my favorite item from the novel is the notion of the Airspheres: large (planet-sized) habitats in which reside multi-kilometer-long dirigible-style creatures, millenia old. As is typical, Banks even develops these \\"characters\\" to an extent that we begin to wish for more information about them. The pages keep turning, and you're left at the end wondering just what hit you.<br />There are so many different plots and subplots that each could be developed into their own respective novels.<br />Definitely recommended.	2003-06-17

Both very hard-sf type people, with exceptionally deep characters and far flung plots that are complex on a macro and micro level.<br />This is not that kind of book. The story is told in the same sort of way that Joe Haldemann wrote _The Forever War_. The story is intriguing, but the author is trying to tell it in far too little space. At only 258 pages, it is a very short read. However, the 258 pages encompass 16 years of time. There are jumps in the book that literally gloss over 3-4 years at a time.<br />The people in the book are not very fully developed. In fact, they are developed to a level I'd expect from Dean Koontz or some other pulp author. There really is only one main character, and you couldn't really call him a protagonist. The story meanders on, holding up this character as some moral lighthouse, some metaphor for humanities need to \\"explore the stars,\\" as it were.<br />It is a very cheery novel, with the darkest parts of the book passing in what could be just a flicker of dark compared to what you'd see in Banks' _Against a Dark Background_, or even Cherryh's _Downbelow Station_.<br />I guess where I'm going with this is the book is as shallow as the characters. It tells a fun, Buck Rogers kind of story, and I'll admit I got attached to it the same way I might get attached to a channel on TV I mistakenly flipped to (and felt compelled to finish the show).<br />Not an excellent book. A fun (and thankfully short) read. Good plane or car material.<br />Ah, one final note. The subtle little pokes at society (such as mentioning \\"Lawrence Livermore/Microsoft Labs\\" in the beginning of the book) really ruffled my feathers. They come out of nowhere, they're not justified, and they just serve to irritate the reader.<br />Buy used.	2003-03-17

Mieville writes a good book, there really isn't any question about that. However, the way in which he insists on writing this book interferes with the story of the book. I'll give you an example:<br />\\"The thing drew on the stored energy it had drawn from the dream___t, and powered its transformation. It self-organized. Its mutating form bubbled and welled up into strange dimensional rifts, oozing like oily sludge over the brim of the world into other planes, and back again. It folded in on itself, shaping itself out of the protean sludge of its own base matter.<br />It was unstable.<br />It was alive, and then there was a time between forms when it was neither alive nor dead, but saturated with power.<br />And then it was alive again. But different.<br />Spirals of biochymical slop snapped into sudden shapes. Nerves that had unwound and dissolved and reknitted in strange constellations.<br />The thing flexed in inchoate agony and a rudimentary, but growing, hunger.\\"<br />Almost every chapter opens this way. You'll be reading a lot of \\"slop\\", \\"ichor\\", \\"blood\\", \\"rust\\", \\"filth\\", \\"sewer\\", et cetera in this book. After the first third or so of the book, you become accustomed to it, and begin to read the story and get interested in the characters.<br />Mieville, however, continues to 'set the stage' of the book to the very last pages. At no point does he ease off the \\"filth\\" in what you're reading. Perhaps his approach is that to do so would be unthorough. Well, Mr. Mieville, I got the point. I understand. I could have used a little less ichor and rotting flesh.<br />All this being said, the story is a good one. It much resembles _The Difference Engine_ by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling. \\"Steam punk\\" they are calling it.<br />I'd recommend it to people who have a distinct \\"fantasy\\" kink, but not to hard SF readers. Additionally, the \\"goth\\" folks out there will probably eat this up and ask for more.<br />....<br />Interesting, exciting, but one star taken off for the needles use of \\"chymical\\" (and other obsolete spellings) continually.

The back of the book has a quote from a reviewer saying \\"He warns you up front, this is a dark novel.\\"<br />Well, compared to Banks' _The Wasp Factory_, this really isn't such a dark novel. I'll quote another reviewer from USENET who said \\"I can't trust an author who develops characters and kills them.\\" This, however, is also a trait of Banks', and I cant imagine anyone would read this book expecting everyone to escape unscathed from the ominous, looming evil which permeates, quite frankly, every Banks book I've read.<br />The book tells a story of a woman, who becomes a metaphor for the star system she lives in. Unlike the Culture novels, the \\"Golter\\" system is at least a hundred million light years from the nearest star. They are entirely isolated. They have colonized all the planets and moons in their system, but have no hope of ever reaching anyone else. Sharrow is the same way. Alone, even while surrounded by others.<br />As the system society begins to attack itself, so, too, does Sharrow lose friends. Entire cities are wiped out.<br />This is not unexpected. You're reading a Banks novel. However, the finish of the book (as other reviewers have hinted, the last 100 pages are worth the rest of the book being somewhat slow and, well, pointless) is quite profound, and ties the rest of the story together in ways I really hadn't anticipated. It actually took me a couple days to reflect on it, and how I felt about the story he had told.<br />Surprisingly, after a couple days, I realized that what Banks was getting at was the good that actually came out of all the death and destruction in the book. I'll leave the reader to discover that on their own.<br />I'd highly recommend this to any Banks fan, but perhaps not to a first time Banks reader. Consider _Excession_ instead.	2003-03-17

In graphic detail. That's about the extent of the first chapter.<br />Next chapter illustrates how weak the girl is and how torn apart she is to lose her new lover. She grows up, bereft of the various sexual deviations. Sob...<br />Progressing a little further, we start with a different girl looking to be violently and sexually abused.<br />Let me give you a brief understanding of this book.<br />The author is one of those male authors who discredit the entire gender. The women in this book are written as thoughtless children who need to be manipulated from one situation to the next by comparitively powerful male characters. These childlike (or indeed child) female characters are navigated from one sexual situation to the next. These sexual interludes actually comprise a good 10-15% of each chapter, if not more. They are violent, and portray submissive oh-so-impressed and oh-so-needing to be pleasured women. There isn't a woman in the book that has any kind of personality, except in the very beginning of the book. These strong women characters are portrayed as thoughtless, having devoted their lives to being strong women instead of the sexual playthings of powerful men.<br />This book just made me sick. I had originally bought it as a science fiction book; a space opera. In fact, the publisher has the audacity to call the book a space opera. Look, I'm as much into porn and BDSM as the next guy, but when I buy a science fiction book, I expect to read one...<br />Thumbs down, unequivocally.	2002-09-28
US	50387192	R2DA9BXMTMTXIO	0441008356	824019804	Revelation Space	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Excellent Space Opera	I came to Alastair Reynolds after reading several CJ Cherryh books (Cyteen, Devil To The Belt). I was interested in more SF, but was kind of tired of the soap-opera and political wrangling of Cherryh's books. Don't get me wrong, I love her books, but sometimes I just want to read a book about spacey traditional SF stuff.<br />Alastair Reynolds' first book, Revelation Space, offers a rich story weaving several complex independant plotlines into one whole story spanning many hundreds of years, with the very fate of humanity at its epicentre.<br />Its mature, grown-up fiction. People are ugly and dishonest. Ships arent gleaming chrome arrows flying through space at faster-than-light speeds, and there arent hundreds of benevolent alien races out there working hand in hand. Reynolds paints a dark but plausible future for humanity.<br />What I most appreciated about the book was the seeming determination of the author to \\"keep his feet on the ground.\\" Only once or twice does Reynolds spin off into the SF mumbo-jumbo that often pollutes other operatic SF novels. Reynolds is an astronomer, and that, perhaps, is the root of his reserved prose.<br />Overall a wholly enjoyable book. When you finish, you might want to pick up the other books he has written. Amazon.com does not sell them in the US, but amazon.co.uk does sell the three other books -- two of which are sequels, and the other takes place in the same universe.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-09-04

I spend at least 12 hours a day using vim. My hope was that I'd learn a couple new things that would help me use vim more efficiently, or macros, or whatever.<br />Unfortunately, this book is really not written for an experienced vim user. It is written for somebody who is scared of vi in general and needs a book to start with. The author goes over such mundane details as &quot;how to get out of insert mode&quot; to a horrifying degree.<br />I didn't really learn anything reading this book. Vim comes with exceptional documentation, and this book seems to be nothing more than a digestion of that documentation.<br />I really would recommend against this book for all but the very new-to-unix user.<br />Oh, and the occasional commentary throughout the book about how unix vim isnt &quot;smart enough&quot; to do something the windows vim does just made me sick.	2002-08-26
US	50387192	RYGN2OY30B4ZX	0345435249	147883919	Darwin's Radio	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Slow beginning, sometimes flaky, but overall very good.	Amazon recommended this book to me after reading Tess Gerrisen's _Gravity_. I generally take these recommendations with a grain of salt, so I checked out the author. Greg Bear is also responsible for a sequel to Asimov's _Foundation_ series. So I picked this book up as a sort of \\"test run\\" before reading Foundation 2.<br />It was a little bit of effort to slog through the first sixty or so pages. Bear starts off kind of slow, with seemingly irrelevant details. In the end, the beginning does pretty well turn out to be irrelevant, but aids in fleshing out some of the characters a little better.<br />The science of the book is mostly sound, and the plot is certainly gripping. I wasnt really sure what was going to happen until the very end, and I was reasonably happy with the way things turned out.<br />Overall, the book was enjoyable from both a Science Fiction standpoint, and from a more general fiction standpoint (the characters are likeable and well developed, and the plot takes a meandering course through well defined and interesting conflicts).<br />There are some elements that detract from the book however. Every so often, you will read something and think \\"gee, that sounds like a book I read in high school.\\" Bear lapses into moments (chapters I dare say) of seemingly \\"immature\\" writing. The language literally changes to something much less dense and less interesting. The good news is there are only a few of these. The other element from the book I disagreed with was his overwhelming need to portray the book as a love story. In general, if I want a love story, I know where to find it, and I don't want it intermingled with my Science Fiction books.<br />I'd recommend this book to just about anyone.	2002-01-28
US	50387192	R1FE10IUZV675W	0671016776	12366720	Gravity	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	Just cant say enough good things about this book!	My fiction background is mostly science fiction, and my non fiction background is extremely technical (theoretical physics, practical physics, computer science, and engineering). I used to read a lot of Crichton, and even stooped as low as Robin Cook and Dean Koontz.<br />I was hesitant to pick up another medical/sci-fi thriller book having been so disappointed by the genre in the past. However, somebody on this site (I can't remember who now) who had reviewed a CD I liked a lot gave a very glowing review of this book.<br />Well, I read this book in pretty much one sitting. It was phenomenal. I read about 30-40 pages before realizing I should put it down. I knew that if I did not put it down, I would get nothing else done until I finished the book.<br />I'm not going to give it away, because the story is so engrossing.<br />The book was at the same time both very technical and very personal. Focusing on a sort of latent love story (which never really surfaces, but the tension is there), and an extremely intense medical drama. She also manages to be rather glib and interesting while still not being afraid to use acronyms and technical terms (dont worry you non-engineer folks, there is a glossary).<br />The depictions of techno stuff are good. Better than average. The medical stuff is engrossing and interesting if not quite realistic.<br />To address Stephen King's assertion she's better than Crichton... well, this book was certainly better than _The Andromeda Strain_, which I wholly enjoyed.<br />Definitely buy this book. Send a copy to your friend. But don't start reading it if you have anything else to do that day.	2002-01-02
US	50387192	R21PWG5IBSVTSQ	007212606X	72313394	Oracle PL/SQL 101	Books	3	2	5	N	Y	A so-so book on PL SQL but mostly on Oracle.	I realize that most of the people reading this review are Oracle people. I also realize most of the people here aren't interested in non-oracle products.<br />However, some of us use open source databases. I personally use PostgreSQL. Postgres has pl/sql functionality, and I was looking to implement some stored procedures to optimize the functioning of several programs I have that iterate over a few hundred thousand rows. I talked to a couple Oracle admins about the problem, and they suggested pl/sql.<br />Bear in mind, I am a perl programmer, and generally I am not interested in programming sql. However, when it comes to performance you really need to offload the brunt of the processing to the database.<br />So I looked for a book on PL/SQL and found that there really werent any that were &quot;beginner&quot; books. Furthermore, I found that all of them were Oracle books. So, I crossed my fingers, and bought the beginner oracle pl/sql book.<br />The first 80% of the book was entirely review, covering the barest basics of SQL, and moving into some other less basic but still not intermediate SQL.<br />By the time the book began to cover pl/sql it had become a heavily windows- and oracle- centric discussion with little attention paid to other databases and other operating systems. The author does not even entertain that people create SQL queries with tools other than SQL*Plus.<br />So perhaps the word on this book would be thus.<br />If youre an oracle admin and windows user, you'll love it. It provides the basics of SQL, and gives a modest tutorial on pl/sql.<br />If youre a programmer and or unix user, you may find yourself disgusted by how pedantic and shallow the book is. If you dont mind spending the $25 for the book, go ahead. Otherwise, there is probably an Oracle DBA around who has a copy of the book, who loved it, and would be happy to let you borrow it.	2001-10-09

I have been examining my career and looking around to see what else interests me. I am a unix and perl hacker. I never took a whole lot of math or bio in college, and worried that a text like this would be as difficult to understand as _Biological Sequence Analysis_ (which I purchased at the same time) was. To put it more clearly, in order to begin understanding _Biological Sequence Analysis_, I am going to have to study Statistics and Discrete Mathematics. Coming from a programming background, I already understand matrix-based math, and I understand string algorithms and algorithms in general.<br />This book allowed me to take a look at what Bioinformatics is all about, and see if I am interested.<br />I can also say, as a perl programmer and general unix guy, that the unix and perl taught in this book are quite good, and concise while still being comprehensive.<br />This is definitely one of the better OReilly books I have read lately.	2001-09-18

I have been doing unix for quite some time now and I am an accomplished perl hacker. I picked this book up after reading the reviews, thinking that it belonged in my library, even if I wasnt going to learn too much from it (I often wind up scouring my library looking for references so I can explain something to a friend or co-worker).<br />I was pleasantly surprised to learn several new things after only reading a few pages of this book. I didn't pick it up and read it front to back, I just looked at the index and started poking around at things I knew I could &quot;brush up on.&quot; Well, I learned that I could be using vi macros to save myself time when coding.<br />Many of the hints and hacks in this book are old Unix advice. This is a good thing for any unix hacker to re-read and re-visit. I definitely recommend this book.<br />One final note. It is published by Que, and Que normally sucks. I was really disappointed after purchasing it to see that it was a Que book. This book really is a good one, and worth even an Accomplished OReilly snob's reading.	2001-09-18

This book is just a rehash of the POD (plain ol' documentation) provided with all the modules included on the CD. Thats about all that needs to be said. I'll elaborate however. As a professional perl programmer, it is my business to know what modules are out there, and thus I know many of them from CPAN. The last place I am going to look is in a big old printed book when I could do this instead: $ perl -MCPAN -e 'i /irc/' if i were looking, for, say, and IRC module (which the book of course doesnt cover). The copy of postgres included with the book is quite old and full of bugs. Newer versions are faster and more stable. There is a chapter provided on creating your own modules, but it is literally less than 2 pages long, and quite laughable on its face. If you want a book on Object Oriented Programming, get Damian Conway's _Object Oriented Programming with Perl_. It's far better. I gave this book 2 stars instead of one because the CD is useful if I am stuck somewhere on dialup and need a CPAN mirror (incomplete that it is).	2001-08-27

This means that I have a lot of interaction with XML.<br />I'm not really interested in sitting down and learning XML because I wouldnt actually go and write it myself. There are plenty of perl modules (XML::Parser, XML::Twig, and so on) that will do that for me. However, I wanted to have some understanding of what XML actually was, and how to read it if I were presented in it.<br />This book started very slow and very easily, and moved into some more advanced (if a little more dry) subject matter. The author uses witty, enjoyable examples, and is very clear at all times about what is being explained.<br />I would recommend this to most programmers who want to just &quot;know what XML is all about,&quot; as it isnt particularly technical (if you are just skimming), and its technical enough for people to get into if need be. It also covers most topics very thoroughly.<br />Another gem from OReilly.	2001-08-23

I race cars, I work on computers, I like knowing how stuff works. Brown gives you lots of juicy details about how he envisions hypothetical technologies working. He isnt afraid to go out on a limb and invent stuff that doesnt exist -- but he does the reader the courtesy of at least explaining how he believes it would work.<br />Dale Brown does an excellent job of dreaming up fictitious war machines. Imagine the &quot;Red October&quot; submarine -- only twice as dangerous. Manned by gregarious and charismatic characters that keep you interested and &quot;rooting for the good guys.&quot;<br />Brown is not particularly good at writing a realistic novel. It is my assertion however, that he does not set out intent to do so. He writes books about the superheros of warfare in the sense that Comic Book authors write about various super powers.<br />He has a vivid imagination and a seemingly accurate grasp of where things in the world lie, and paints a semibelievable political situation.<br />He has an uncanny knack for combat scenes. It's very cool to read twenty pages of one engagement. This is something Clancy doesnt do. Clancy is interested in the &quot;bigger picture.&quot; Brown actually &quot;zooms in&quot; and lets you take part in the nitty gritty, people-are-dying-and-bombs-are-flying melee.<br />There is I guess only one real complaint I have about this book, and I have had it about his previous books (and kept coming back): His extensive use of (correct) russian. I'm not interested in reading russian in italics and attempting to figure out what it means later (as it turns out I have a native russian co-worker). However the book was enormously entertaining and kept me up a couple nights to finish it.<br />Certainly recommended to fans of Brown in general, and possibly recommended to people looking for a change from the dry cookie cutter stuff Clancy has been writing for years.	2001-08-11

Very thin reading, no depth of character, trite metaphors, the whole nine yards.<br />What saves the book however, is that the pace actually picks up and makes for a half fun (I didnt say &quot;interesting&quot;, mind you) read.<br />Also, its small enough that finishing it in a day is a breeze.

There is a brief (and i mean BRIEF) introduction to Socket programming at the end of the book, and a modest introduction to csh programming as well.<br />The reason I purchased this book is I have been spending a lot of time with BSD unix flavors (Open/Free BSD, old solaris), and wanted to get a grasp of how they were different from SysV. I wanted to know things like file placement, differences in the kernel, and so on.<br />This book provides none of it. Think of it as a primer users guide for unix. Not for somebody who is administrating machines.<br />On its face, I certainly wouldnt even say it was worth half its horrendous... price. its a flimsy paperback with little value to anyone who knows the ins and outs of vi, ls, cd, and the other basic unix commands.<br />Buy an OReilly book.	2001-06-10

I mean, the book starts with the slaying of the most interesting characters in the entire book. It is tough to recover into an 'interesting' story from that plot line.<br />I will read other Capote books, but stick to his Fiction in the future.<br />2 stars deducted for high &quot;boring factor&quot;.	2001-06-04

He tells a story of mid 1920's spain, and of almost-youths travelling and enjoying life. Its a book that makes you want to curl up with it and just lay about on the couch reading.<br />I love Hemingway's writing, and have been a fan ever since reading The Old Man And The Sea.

So the material was not particularly &quot;new&quot; for me. I can see how it would be difficult to understand for a user who was new to shell programming.<br />If the intended audience is the intermediate unix user who knows something of programming, this book gets a full 5 star, my seal-of-approval rating. Terrific.<br />One thing it is lacking is a brief mention of perl or of awk. In many cases, it is simpler to write:<br />date | awk '{ print $2 }'<br />instead of:<br />date | cut -d' ' -f2<br />or, at least from the standpoint of understandability and readability. but the book doesnt claim to be a manual for awk, and oreilly has an excellent book on the subject.<br />I continually recommend this book to people, and where ever I go, I find this book on the bookshelves of successful people.	2001-05-31

He thus moves quite deftly from subject to subject, taking the time to explain things in terms that any reader should be able to understand.<br />However, for a book on Science, Kaku gets caught up in discussions about things that did not contribute much to the text (although a discussion of God does not necessarily _detract_ from the book, it isnt what I was looking for).<br />Kaku has written another book, _Visions_, which covers many of the subjects elaborated on in this book. I would suggest readers get the Visions book, and also pick up a copy of the much more modern and somewhat higher-brow book by Brian Greene, _The Elegant Universe_.<br />Four stars because it is a good book, five if it were contemporary.	2001-05-22

However, after reading this book, I am very confident at being able to achieve it.<br />The pictures are excellent. There are diagrams, there are pointers (such as telling you to wire in Cat-5 cable whenever you do wiring, an EXCELLENT pointer!!), and helpful hints throughout the entire text.<br />I have a little electronics background (I'm an IT guy and used to work with Automotive Electronics), so I wasnt too scared going into it.

Some of it we really would love to have framed.<br />The images are suitable for anyone to look at, with only a few being tantalizing or vaguely... scintillating.

I am already fairly skilled with the vi (and vim) editor and I was trying to pick up small pointers and tips that would increase my efficiency with the editor. I do a lot of programming with vi, and I know there are some things that I am not doing that could be saving me time.<br />Perhaps the best comparison for this book would be the OReilly Sed &amp; Awk pocket reference. That is really a fantastic little book that offers a cohesive and brief introduction to the editor.<br />This book, instead, reads like a list of commands with very brief descriptions with, seemingly, little scheme or order. It is easier to read the manpage. Sadly, I have not found much use for this book yet.<br />So it might be good to have around if you were trying to do something on a system without manpages, or if you were willing to dedicate the time to figure out the organization of this book (whcih I frankly doubt there is).

Second, Lincoln has contributed enormous amounts of code to the perl community, and I originally bought this book as an insight to the code of his that I have and want to work with further.<br />Let me say that a lot of the book focuses on modules like Net::Telnet and Net::FTP. That isnt particularly useful to me because I have a firm understanding of them already.<br />The real meat of the book, if you ask me, is the discussion of fully multiplexed servers that are able to handle many simultaneous upstreams and downstreams, and do a vast array of things.<br />His code is very clear and concise, as well as commented and explained throughout the text. This is definitely something every perl programmer who writes network maintenance code should have.	2001-04-06

I bought this book for two reasons.<br />First, I wanted to get it because I didnt have it and I own the rest of the oreilly perl books. For this purposes, the book is excellent. It definitely rounds out a collection.<br />Second, I wanted to write some complex data storage and data parsing algorithms. I was going to be using complex data structures, and I was going to need efficient algorithms. Furthermore, I was going to need to implement some C code because parts of the task involved legacy code.<br />This book provided sort of indirect hints into what might be a good idea. However, as a whole, it is one of the least useful of my perl books.<br />I think that most people who are going to be able to understand this book arent going to need it for 75% of the tasks theyre going to be embarking on. Something like Mastering Algorithms With Perl and, to a lesser extent, Mastering Regular Expressions, would definitely be more useful.<br />Advanced Perl Programming contains one section that none of the other perl books out there contain -- a section on embedding C in perl and perl in C. This is something I found absolutely necessary, and this book was the only real source of that information. However, the examples and code provided are all but useless. Furthermore, the Inline:: group of modules for perl...  make almost all the examples and code in this book obsolete.<br />To sum this up in two sentences: This book does not provide anything that you cannot glean from perldoc with equal efficiency or retention. This book provides examples and instruction that are largely obsolete or better provided by other books.	2001-02-26

My primary workstation is a linux box. So while I also develop code in perl, I administer my system in perl. I have O'Reilly's entire bookshelf on Perl (except the Gecko [win32] book). This book is a welcome companion to them. It's written a little differently than youre used to if you have a steady diet of oreilly (as i do). I dont think its meant to be read straight-through as the oreilly books are. Rather this book provides a good reference. Sort of a phone book -- you wouldnt use it to find out how the phone works, but rather to look up a number. I bought this book in a larger set of perl books, and definitely recommend it.<br />a final note to this: the description on how to program in CGI, while a little sparse, is easy to read, and made my first forays into CGI programming a breeze (reading perldoc CGI was an absolute bear!).	2000-10-24

I bought this &quot;book&quot; because I am writing a program that deals  extensively with strings and text (natural language parsing). I was having  some difficulty mastering sed, and understanding how it works. For example,  &quot;s/[^A-Za-z]//&quot; was not working (to remove non alpha chars).  After five pages in this little gem, I knew what I needed. A trailing  &quot;g&quot;.<br />The book is rich with examples, explanations, and really  just cuts straight to the chase.<br />This is not a book for the casual user.  It is, after all, a reference, not a tutorial. Unix users (and  administrators) who already have a basic grasp of regular expressions and  just what sed and awk are (and grep/egrep too) will find this most  rewarding.<br />While I have a hard time paying this much for what amounts to  less than toaster oven instructions, it is absolutely invaluable to me, and  it doesnt take up space on my desk or bookshelf.	2000-09-13

I strongly disagree with Amazon's calling this book a superb collection of  short stories. What this book does contain is the author's first attempts  (and very early attempts at that) at writing good fiction.<br />I read this  book after I read the Nights Dawn trilogy, and I read it mainly for  &quot;educational value.&quot; That is to say, I wanted to know a little  more about the author.<br />While I wasn't expecting much, I was still  disappointed. The writing is just nowhere near as engrossing or interesting  as his later works.<br />I dont suppose I would be able to convince any  Hamilton fan not to read it, but for those of you who arent sure you want  to spend $6 on this book -- don't.<br />It doesn't offer any new insight into  any of the characters you've come to like. The stories are written in what  seems to be great haste, and they lack the depth and feeling present in  Night's Dawn.<br />Hopefully Hamilton will write some new fiction, maybe even  in the same universe as this book and Night's Dawn. Until then, however, I  think I am going to wait before reading any more Hamilton.	2000-09-13

I read this book and _Abra Cadaver_ (also by Tucker) while on vacation and  snowed in for a couple weeks.<br />I was initially quite interested in the  book, as the first few chapters happened quickly and the protagonist  (Merlin, again) is a likeable guy.<br />The rest of the book, however, is just  not too well written, and not too believeable. The plot devices are  unimaginable, the dialog is choppy, and often times the author forgets to  inform the reader of crucial details.<br />After all, a murder novel isnt a  mystery if the author has not posed the &quot;whodunnit&quot; question with  any talent; it's merely an obfuscated tale of events.<br />Skip this book, or  pick it up second-hand and read it on a long plane flight.

I read Zahn's Star Wars books when I was a teenager and loved them. I've recently been going through Amazon's extensive SF collection, and picking  out favorite authors when I re-happened-upon Zahn's continued writing.  Intrigued, I picked up this book, hoping for more of what I had seen in the  Thrawn books.<br />What I found is that Zahn has simply written another novel  in a mostly Star Wars-esque universe without the engaging and interesting  characters and with minute, banal details inserted for some semblance of  &quot;originality.&quot;<br />What worse, I'd estimate that 80% of this book  isn't even science fiction at all. It really is quite a stupid murder  mystery. The &quot;whodunnit&quot; is so uninteresting that the rest of the  book suffers. The book is supposed to be, by all accounts, about a  miraculous new device that our unwitting protagonist has stumbled upon. Yet  nowhere in the book is this device used, or discussed, nor are its  implications even contemplated.<br />As a book by itself, _The Icarus Hunt_  falls flat on its sorry face. I would suggest readers pick up Zahn's Thrawn  books, which had George Lucas' inspiration to instill them with character  and familiarity. For adult readers (as this is adequate high-school science  fiction), I would suggest Carl Sagan or Peter Hamilton's _The Naked God_  trilogy.<br />I was sorely disappointed by this book, and I suspect others  will be too.	2000-08-13

James Lee Burke writes in a quirky, but likeable prose. Often, it isn't  quite clear just what he is getting at because of his continual use of  metaphor. After the reader gets used to it, however, the writing takes on a  charming -feeling-, and the style is familiar and expected.<br />He paints  vivid, full-sensual portraits of scenery and characters, going as far as to  describe scents and lighting highlights, the fog and atmosphere, the sweat  in peoples' hair, et cetera.<br />The mystery isn't over-complex, but isn't  quite simple, either. This book (like Burke's others) are not just about  the murder mystery, theyre a story told about characters. And you want to  keep reading, even after the book is over, to &quot;keep in touch&quot;  with the cahracters he has created and richly portrayed.<br />Burke is one of  the better mystery authors writing today. This is a great book, but  certainly none of his should be missed.	2000-08-13

However, this is not a  science fiction novel, and I found myself a bit disappointed by it.

After being sorely disappointed by the middle two books (other reviewers have hinted at a &quot;middle-book syndrome&quot;, which _The Neutronium Alchemist_ suffered from), I wasn't quite sure what to expect from _The  Naked God_. And... paying for a hardcover was something I hadn't expected  to have to do.<br />As I started to read _The Naked God_, Hamilton seemed to  have grabbed hold of what made _The Reality Disfunction_ such a good book  (or rather pair of books). He created gripping suspense on several  plotlines.<br />Then, with what wasn't quite literary grace, he began to weave  them all together into a comprehensive climax that began to clarify just  *what* was going on. New characters emerged. Incredible new scenery was  described. New races were defined. New technology was imagined.<br />I won't  hint at the ending. Other reviewers found it a cop-out; I enjoyed it.  Science Fiction simply can't cope anymore with the realm of Science Fact  that we now know. Sure, it might have been a cop-out, but this is fiction.  Temporary Suspension of Disbelief and all.<br />What I will do, though, is  give you an idea of how satisified I was with the resolution of the series.  As I read through the book, I began to pick up hints of the same  inspiration I felt after reading Carl Sagan's _Contact_. I suppose that's  one of the highest compliments you can pay a SF author. But I'll continue:<br />Hamilton doesn't just end the series. Hamilton leaves the ending both  resolved an unresolved. He has created a universe that is ripe for further  epics. That's right: this may be a contemporary _Foundation_ (at what? 15  books?). Folks, he is better than C. J. Cherryh. He is better than Herbert.  The guy's still young -- give him 20 years and he may *be* that next  Asimov.<br />My only regret after plowing through all 3500 pages of this saga  is that the &quot;middle two&quot; books were written. They were  superfluous and unnecessary. It would have been much simpler to publish a  2500-page Tolstoyesque epic, and Hamilton would have come off a lot  better.<br />Oh, and one parting comment. I was disgusted by the shoddy  quality of the proofreading/editing. It seemed that every other page  contained spelling errors, grammatical errors, et cetera. To the degree  that some pages had as many as three or four errors. Hamilton will really  need to keep an eye on his publisher in the future.<br />The five stars  stands, even with my resignations, because this book is one of the best SF  novels I've read.sh a  2500-page Tolstoyesque epic, and Hamilton would have come off a lot  better.<br />Oh, and one parting comment.

The ideas contained in this series are  just as intriguing.

I started reading books like this when I was quite young -- 13. I started with _Schrodinger's Cat_ and moved on to _A Brief History of Time_, and then started taking physics courses to get more information.<br />However, all  of this string theory should be new, even to undergrad college students.  Most college physics professors will only teach or even briefly touch upon  what is 100% confirmed. String theory is fascinating (if not confirmed) --  but you probably wont find it in a run-of-the-mill classroom.<br />The author  presents his information in a very convincing manner. Another reader said  &quot;facts-about-to-be-proved&quot; or somesuch. This is true. I find no  reason to disagree with his methods of explaining this theory and am rather  glad that he comes across like he does.<br />The book is not an _easy_ read --  I've had quite a few college physics courses and I found myself struggling  towards the end -- but it is a worthwhile read for anyone who understands  general relativity and/or quantum mechanics and would like to understand  where the two of them meet.<br />I would recommend the book to anyone.	2000-07-13

A friend recommended this book to me as the &quot;best science fiction he had ever read.&quot; I simply do not agree.<br />You've read the synopsis: The book is set in the near future, say 2030 a.d. or so.<br />The author has a  delightful sense of humor and witty prose. The characters are  well-developed and like-able. His view of the future is sufficiently dark  and yet somewhat plausible. However, his endlessly smug tone and his  self-indulgent sense of humor slow the storyline of the book to a veritable  crawl.<br />This book has tones of Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_,  Gibson's _Neuromancer_, and even some Elmore Leonard in it. The effect  would be spectacular if Stephenson was a strong enough author to pull it  off. Sadly, he isn't. I will keep my eye on his later books and perhaps  future titles... but probably borrow them next time rather than buy.	2000-06-29

I found this book in Amazon's &quot;Authors Recommendations.&quot; I had been looking through the classics, and purchased this with _The Old Man and the Sea_, and _Catch-22_.<br />The book was not a particularly enthralling  read. The writing is in simple, rigidly-structured sentences. Very  reminiscent, in fact, of Bram Stoker's _Dracula_. The author makes mention  in her notes at the end of the book that the myriad &quot;diary  entries&quot; and &quot;letters&quot; and &quot;journal entries&quot; are a  historical point; that much history was recorded in such items. However,  because of the extensive use of these tools, the book takes on a tangled  third-person viewpoint which, while not particularly confusing, dilutes the  book. Many characters are developed, their plights learned, and their  struggles fleshed out, but only as much as the rest of the characters and  the book suffers for it.<br />Additionally, the book is reviewed and portrayed  as an adventure saga. In that regard, it is over within the first 250  pages. The book simply drags on... and on... and on.<br />I think this would  be an appropriate high school sophomore text, but is clearly not a book for  a sophisticated reader looking for stimulating entertainment.<br />Perhaps the  abridged audiobook would be more fulfilling. I gave the book three stars  because two was simply too harsh a rating.	2000-06-13

Having been given this book by a friend for a long plane trip, I managed to read almost all of it in one sitting. That is not to say that it was particularly gripping.

Large text,  simple sentences, uncomplicated plot devices, and a pre-determined plot  (guess what, god wins...).<br />I did enjoy the book from a brain junk-food  perspective. The story is an interesting read. The concept is quite  intriguing, even if from a secular standpoint.<br />Minus the religious babble  thrown into the book, it's an okay read -- something to occupy your mind  while, say, sitting on a subway train or in an airplane flying across the  country.<br />I can't say I was religiously moved by the book, and frankly, it  fairly drips with religious admoninitions. If you can see past that,  though, you'll be sure to get your two-stars' worth of epic adventure  reading out of it.<br />Borrow it; don't buy it.	2000-06-13
