The first half of the book tells the story of Shay going back in time and living in her grandmother's body as a young adult, and the second half is devoted to what her grandmother goes thru, living in Shay's body and being thrown into modern times. You get a chance to see how the stories link themselves at certain synchronized events. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I honestly didn't like the way it ended. Was expecting a little more closure. Won't spoil it for you. Overall, a good story. <br />	2005-10-03

Despite all the highly-rated reviews, I must agree with the Publisher's Weekly review above. I just couldn't get into this book. Even though the slight \\"mystery\\" aspect was there, it was a little too cookie-cutter for me. Nonetheless, I do realize we all have different tastes in books. For me, I need a little more suspense.	2005-10-03

I read this book over the course of three mornings. A great way to start the day. A simplistic yet profound message that will change the way you look at yourself and other people. I love how at one point he directs our attention to the page we are reading stating how a sheet of paper is more than just a sheet of paper. It contains the clouds, the rain, the sun, the trees, the logger (even the logger's wheat breakfast),etc. One cannot exist without the other. How often do we focus on every breath we take? Consciously, we can breathe in while we \\"heal our bodies\\", then breathe out and \\"smile\\" (which I am sure most of us are lacking). This is a quick, yet effective, exercise you can try right now as you read these reviews -- breathing and smiling. Smiling works. It changes how you feel and it affects others positively. Try it the next time you are out and about. We are all connected. His message in this book is beautiful. Can't wait to read more and revisit this one in the near future to increase my understanding of his philosophies of mindful living.  Enjoy!	2005-07-18

She made the scenes, characters and actions come to life. Very vivid writing. The reason I give this 3 stars is that, yes, the book starts out wonderfully exciting. It hooks you. For a while it was a page-turner, and then somewhere mid-way the fire kind of died out for me until closer to the end where it became a bit more difficult to pick up the book. The plot just conveniently \\"wrapped itself up\\" a bit too neatly and quickly for me with all the suspense we were forced to go thru for many, many chapters. Overall, I would recommend it because it is so different and entertaining. I will likely read another Fobes book in the future, though, to compare....possibly the one that sparked it all....Touch Not The Cat?	2005-05-19
US	51961018	R14RBQQWGLHGMB	006109398X	343008033	Treasure Box	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Just So-so.....	This was my first Orson Scott Card book (picked it out of the 25+ on the library shelf). It just sounded like it would be interesting, and it was. <br /> <br />I wouldn't read this again nor would I recommend it. <br /> <br />Many times I found myself saying, \\"Oh please, get real.\\" Many sections seemed like a joke or something written by an amateur. No offense, though. My husband loved Card's Ender's Game, and rates it as one of his favorites. It's possible that with Treasure Box, I just picked a bad one. I didn't realize the author was trying something new here, and I simply did not connect. I did finish the book because it passed my book rule. <br /> <br />As I love to read and can't waste much time on boring or exceedingly LONG stories, I give a deadline, a sort of stopping point, right at the first 10% of the book. By this point I usually know if I like the author's style and the story. I usually place a little marker in my book at that point, and when I reach it if I honestly don't feel like picking the book up again, I usually won't.  <br /> <br />Well, this was a 300-page book and I placed my stopping marker at page 30. But starting at page 1, I was there, so it got off to a good start and seemed to keep its momentum. By the end, though, the only reason I kept at it was because I had devoted so much time and wanted to see how Card wrapped things up to review it honestly. <br /> <br />Will probably try another better-rated Card book another time. Will admit Treasure gave me some awesome dreams!   :)	2005-03-23

I purchased this book because it was so beautiful when I flipped thru it (and on sale). It is most unique though; some pages hold little trinkets like miniature envelopes with letters inside. Although the story was slightly interesting and ends like a fairy tale, this is a purchase more for the beauty of the book, rather than the actual content. I would give the book four stars for its beauty alone, but I didn't want the Amazon rating to be misleading in how it's ranked. A great item for the coffee table.	2004-11-08

That's the sign of a good book. When was the last time you've had a 5-star read? <br /> <br />It's so eerie...almost as if this book found me. I am sure many women will be able to relate to it if they have ever been in a love they cannot forget, a love impossible to explain, yet lingers in the depth of your being. In this book, it is purported to happen only \\"once\\" in a lifetime; i.e. your \\"orchard of truth\\". The grandmother's advice in this book? \\"When you find your orchard of truth, you must find a way to enter it...\\" There is so much wisdom in this book. The beauty rituals alone are worth the price. I will compile notes to incorporate many of them into my life as well as with my daughters. I learned so much about culture and traditions; about the importance of being a woman and living life true to self -- not for others. About knowing yourself before sharing yourself with others; about saving yourself for true love. It's all about following your heart to minimize a life of regrets.  <br /> <br />Some portions of the book delve into true intimacy and will be a little risque for some I suspect, but truth prevails in its entirety for those who are honest with love. <br /> <br />This will definitely be purchased to add to my library. It's been a long time since I have been brought to tears with a book, but Marisol hit the nail on the head. She is so eloquent a writer, she says things precisely the way I feel. How does she do that? <br /> <br />For any woman in her 30's (and above) who has contemplated life, where she is, where she is going and choices that she has made at the sacrifice of self, this book is for you. I guarantee it will give you a new lease on life. I am most grateful to Marisol and this gem of a novel. Bravo!	2004-10-28

I also agree with some of the readers that a lot of loose ends needed to be tied. But overall, I really became glued to this book from Chapter 1. Loved the characters. Loved the time-travel aspect. Loved the culinary aspect. Made me interested in food science/wild herbs. What would I do without my modern day cooking conveniences? Could I rough it in the wild? I just loved the simplicity of the story, the story-telling, and the unexpected twists and turns it took. I felt like I jumped right into the town of Legend and really hated to leave it. Having lived in Alexandria, Virginia, it was nice to hear about some old stomping grounds mentioned, like Tyson's Corner Mall. Cole really was addictive. Loved him. The story never gets boring. My first Deveraux book (based on the ratings/suggestions here), but definitely not my last. Just checked out &quot;A Knight In Shining Armor&quot;. Thanks for the recommendations guys.

Just picked it up from the library today on a whim and couldn't put it down. Talk about a match made in heaven (Tasha and Richard). Tasha must have sensed Richard would do her justice, and he most certainly did. Even though this is a libary loan, I am buying this book for my own personal collection. Tasha's philosophy on life and her love for family, theater, crafts, animals, flowers and art was most infectious. I love how she is honest with herself and alludes to creating a paradise on earth, but also acknowledges that she is human and has made mistakes in life, which keeps it all very real. Use your good china, wear your antique clothing, collect vintage seeds and transport/replant your favorite fruit trees if you so desire. Progress with the new, but remember to go back and learn from the oldest, simplest ways of living, as it can afford many unforeseen treasures. Truly admired Tasha's pure connection with animals to the point where she even took in an infant snake and nursed it until it was too big to keep in the house any longer. Wow! Buy your flower bulbs in multitudes and plant them in clumps. See the beauties in the branches of the trees (clip some and take them indoors to enjoy). Smell the flowers. Buy a dog or several. Buy some birds (or 40). Create your own menagerie. Cook with a talking parrot on your shoulder. It's the little things, folks. Have you ever seen a moon-lit rainbow? I haven't, but will be on the look-out. =)I wanna stick my nose in dove feathers and plant flower bulbs at random -- in large clumps -- wherever I please. I wanna get a dog and feed it homemade soup instead of that trash in those metal cans. Tasha claims that lots of garlic in her soups keeps the dogs flea-free. Never too old to learn.  I honestly agree with nearly everything Tasha touched on. Step outside of the box. Live life a little. Get back to basics. Note your likes and dislikes. Learn a new craft. Learn something new. Recite your favorite authors' works or poems. Learn to be self-sufficient. Live life to the fullest! No book has touched me like this in a long, long time. I am going to run out and get me a real nice, old bookshelf and start my own dollhouse rooms on each level. I've always wanted my own canoe, but Tasha has given me the courage to seriously look into it. Look at her skin and body.....if she can carry a canoe and buckets of fresh water on her shoulders, so can I at 35. I wanna use my best China and have a yard full of animals that know I love them and love me back. I just wanna be me and Tasha has helped me to see how important that is. Most of all, I want to pass on to my husband and kids that it is okay to be who you are, but always remain open to the simple, free joys we have been given in everyday life. <br />Thank you, Tasha, for allowing us to enter your oasis and thank you Richard Brown for allowing us to have a sneak peek of Tasha's &quot;paradise on earth&quot;.	2003-09-10

Found this lovely little book in the \\"discard\\" pile at the library, so I grabbed it for my two daughters (ages 6 & 8). The book is about 150 pages with 10 chapters and pictures throughout for personal enjoyment. I immediately enjoyed the book from chapter 1, and each night I read a chapter with my girls, asking them questions about what's happening, what's happened, and what they think is going to happen. They are really relating to the adventures. Simple, yet entertaining. Love how little educational tidbits are placed in the story. It's a wonderful learning tool. Honestly, my daughters are begging for the next chapter each night! That's why I'm online now trying to order another book by this lovely author. Never a dull moment. Recommend this little gem highly!  - Happy Mom. :)	2003-03-11

Since you already have the editorial review above, suffice it to say, this guy is very talented and you won't be disappointed.

US	51961018	RSOEPNLGCOYOH	0312868863	349837324	Somewhere In Time	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A wonderfully engaging story	It has really been a long time since I read a really good book, but once I picked up this one, I honestly couldn't put it down. The story line just drew me in immediately. I felt like I was there (in the story) the entire time. Time travel is a really intriguing topic. I even plan on one day visiting that hotel in San Diego, if only for a night! I hear the Travel Channel rated that particular beach in the story #2 in the nation? Of course, I couldn't wait to see the movie after finishing the book, but it goes without saying, there really isn't enough time in an hour-and-a-half long movie to put all of those little nuances you get in the story itself. The limited time in a movie makes it difficult for the characters to develop themselves, even though Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeves did a wonderful job. It's unfortunate, though, because the book is wonderful and the movie -- pretty good -- but nothing like the book. So, if nothing else, the book is a must-read; then, treat yourself to the movie as the companion. Overall, enjoy life and always enjoy a good read.	2002-07-16

I felt obligated to post my review because, as cheesy as it may sound, Alexandra Stoddard's book, Living A Beautiful Life, actually changed my life  -- for the better.  I'll agree that all of the Grace Notes are not for everyone -- they are merely suggestions. Neither do I try and do everything that she recommends.  But she did succeed at getting me to look at life and its daily routine in a different way.  She's also introduced me to wonderful authors, such as Madeleine L'Engle.  Alexandra's writing has helped me to live a more beautiful life &quot;in the moment&quot; by appreciating every blessing and using every moment to add more beauty to it. Now I try and celebrate  every little aspect of life, if possible, by not keeping anything mundane. My life greatly reflects my passion for life and I am now more aware of the beauty involved in simple existence. Alexandra has written other great books (which have helped me tremendously) on relationships, family, interior decorating, the lost art of letter writing, etc. Remember, it's all about what works for you.  I'm currently collecting Alexandra's books and highly recommend them all. Alexandra, thank you very much. By sharing your passion, you give a wonderful gift.   :)	2001-05-09

Okay, so I just checked this out from the library yesterday and my kids (two daughters, ages 4 &amp;6) were fighting over it!  I don't usually do this so soon, but I ran out... and immediately bought a copy of it for my personal (keepsake) bookshelf.  These honestly have to be the best illlustrations I've ever seen in a book -- period!

I think that the author is very talented, but the book never clicked for  me. I never made a true connection to the characters and the story seemed a  little &quot;rushed&quot; (the book IS very small). The sex scenes between  Nina and her brother-in-law were a little too frequent and a little over  the edge for me, but I realize different readers have different tastes. I  LOVED the author's style of writing and it was very visual, but the book is  definitely not a &quot;re-read&quot; for me, nor would I recommend it to  anyone. I think the author has great potential and the people who really  enjoyed this book would probably also love any books by Alice Hoffman  (check site for reviews). I like Alice Hoffman's prose as well, but she  does a much better job with her storylines. I'll admit that the ending was  pretty darned good in that I had to go back and reread the previous page  just to make sure I got it right. :) Best wishes to Ms. Dunmore!	2000-09-05

All I can say is that I've never read fantasy before. My husband had this  book and was reading it faithfully DAILY! He kept making strange noises,  i.e., chuckling, ROFL, gasping, saying things out loud like,  &quot;ooooooooh......oh-my-God!.........Oh  no!............Wheeeeeeeeee!&quot; It's kinda like someone cracking up  laughing and you don't know the joke. Anyway, he dared me to read the first  50 pgs of this MASSIVE book. I thought, &quot;Yeah, right&quot;. But he bet  me that I wouldn't just put it down after that. And I didn't. This is  probably one of the best books I've ever read, simply because it's the kind  of book that pulls you INTO the story with the characters. Then once you're  in, you're waiting for that next moment in your day just to be able to pick  up the book again and find out what's going on in that world. I swear I've  never felt more closer to characters or more &quot;inside&quot; a story  than I did with this one. There's mystery, humor, torture, romance,  suspense, horror, (even spiritual undertones, i.e., the sword and Seeker of  Truth)........something for EVERYONE! This story will stick with you for  months, if not years. It's definitely a &quot;re-read&quot;. Okay, you  don't have to take MY word for it.  Go ahead......I dare you to read 50  pgs.
