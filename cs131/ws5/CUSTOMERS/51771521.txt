Personally, I can't imagine sending them to anyone since they're not foldover cards, and I just don't send squares of cardstock.  However, they make marvelous gift tags -- just punch a hole in the upper left hand corner, write your message on the back, and thread your tag around the gift.  You could also put them in the envelopes for that purpose. And, if you like to make things, these would provide an unsurpassed inspiration about themes, designs, and quotes.  <br />In short, I think it was extremely well done, and love mine.	2001-06-08

Although intended for children aged 9-12, it is perfect for all ages, including adult.<br />The book explains the concept of sharing and giving, and includes many folk tales, fables, and legends (from many countries) that stress the importance of charitable giving.  If you like the Chicken Soup for the Soul types of books, you should greatly enjoy this.  And you could use the folk tales as the basis for many crafts to make for yourself or for gifts (not to mention to teach children about charitable giving).<br />It also stresses The Giving Box, used to keep handy to put spare change in at the end of the day, to share with those less fortunate when the box is full.  That would be marvelous for chidren, but is also great for anyone at any age.  The book explains the Jewish tradition of this type of box, which is still used in many Jewish homes -- and how to adapt it for other faiths, since charitable giving applies to all of us.<br />HIGHLY recommended for people of all ages.  If you've got a heart -- or need one -- this book is for you.	2001-06-07

Nevertheless, I must concede that that gal can REALLY cook.  I got several of my most favorite recipes from this book.  Although I can't remember them all off-hand, I know that the peach pie was one of them -- and, IMHO, that one, alone, was well worth the cost of the hardcover book.<br />I also remember a humorous passage about substituting leaves from a backyard tree for grape leaves in a Greek recipe -- and eating peanut butter that night &lt;g&gt;.<br />HIGHLY recommended for the recipes, albeit not the politics.  (Ms. Morgan is committed to monogamous marriages, as am I.  However, although a Christian who puts Jesus at the head of my home, I, myself, just can't condone expecting women to put themselves aside and always put their husbands first.  Nevertheless, if you can skim over those passages, you'll find some mighty fine eating -- and, actually, there are a large number of helpful hints for a happy marriage as well. I just wasn't thrilled to find them in a cookbook, and couldn't stomach the &quot;Hubby is first; I am a lowly second&quot; attitude. But the recipes were worth it -- delectable and easy to prepard.	2001-06-05

Clear directions for gorgeous projects	I love this book!  Quilling (paper filigree) is a breathtakingly beautiful art dating back many centuries, which nuns used to use to make exquisite reliquiries (sp?).  Some of the work can be found in museums.  Best of all, it is easy to master and unbelievably low cost ... Although it won't be archival, many people cut their own strips by putting recycled paper (including flyers and other paper with printing on one side) through a standard paper shredder.  You can quill using only your fingers, a corsage pin, a toothpick, a purchased tool, or one you make yourself by gluing the pointed end of a sewing needle into the eraser end of a pencil (pushing it in, then letting it dry) and then cutting off the tip of the hole, leaving a wonderful slot that won't leave a mark.  What other art is low cost, portable, easy, gorgeous, etc.?<br />This book features a gallery (with such gorgeous work as a lion), plus photos and directions for all kinds of quilled projects.  My personal favorite is Bobbye Singer's swans (with their necks forming a heart).  On the quick-but-beautiful scale is a lady's quilling of the word shalom, with a dove of peace over one end.<br />The directions are clear to get you started in no time.  Just remember that the book was written by a lady who sells quilling paper, patterns, and tools, and thus doesn't stress how to inexpensively make your own.  But that certainly doesn't mean that you can't.<br />Although I own almost every quilling book, booklet, video, and pattern available, this is my personal favorite.  VERY highly recommended.	2001-06-05

This was the worst waste of money I ever spent. All of the short, simple &quot;tips&quot; are self-explanatory; I can't even imagine anyone over the age of 9 not already knowing them.

Before reading it, about all I knew about the Shakers was that they were originally a fringe group of Quakers who shook (rather than quaked) in the presence of the Lord, and who believed in chastity for all members -- and that they made beautiful furniture and were outstanding cooks.  But this book takes you right into a Shaker community, and makes the people seem very real.  It therefore provided a fascinating glimpse into their way of life.  But that was all serendipitious -- it is an excellent mystery in its own right, and thoroughly enjoyable.  I can't wait to read the rest of this series.	2001-01-22

The projects are dumb; I don't think there is one I would even consider doing, and they're more appropriate for pre-schoolers -- e.g., for a favor, pour maple syrup into little bottles and top each with a pinecone.  IMHO, that would be great if you had your own maple trees and were sharing your own syrup, but repouring a little from a jar you bought is just stupid.  And that was one of the better ideas in this stupid book.  I can't believe they went to press with this dumb thing; what a waste of money.	2001-01-21

Directions to make unique, special favors, gifts	This book is truly unique, and unbelievably special.  The author mentions many traditions, legends, and childhood experiences which make certain projects all the more special.  There are numerous types of dolls (many with legends behind them), many types of fabric containers, etc. -- all of which would make splendid gifts or favors.  (There is even a fabric cicada with an inspiration legend behind it, a sparrow purse, etc.)  Each of these projects is wholly unique and strikingly beautiful -- although the temari ball is of the type that children played with, rather than the intricate threaded sorts popular for Christmas tree ornaments.  Although I have not yet had time to make any of the projects, the directions and diagrams appear very clear, and I can't wait to get rolling.  These are definitely not &quot;same old, same old&quot; -- each is unique, and incredibly special.	2000-12-30

It contains recipes from customers all over the country -- and almost all are preceded by descriptions of why their family loves them, how many people beg for them, etc.  Many also include directions for packaging as gifts.  The book also contains cute illustrations, many of which provide great ideas for decorating one's own gift containers.  There are also a number of quotations, some of which you may want to incorporate in your own crafts.  There is nothing fancy about this book or the recipes -- it is primarily down home cooking, and everything I've tried has been delectable -- from layered cookie mix in a jar to main dishes.  VERY highly recommended.	2000-12-25

It provides clear, step-by-step directions for a large number of projects, many of which are unique, and most of which will become family heirlooms.  They vary in complexity (so some will be perfect for virtually every age of chiild).  There were several I want to make for myself -- e.g., memory jars, made by covering a container with modeling compound and sticking charms and other saved treasures into the clay, so they will harden there. Although I seem to buy every craft magazine and book on the market, that's the only place I've ever seen this particular project.<br />My one and only quibble is with the title.  IMHO, this would be equally appropriate for fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, grandparents/aunts/uncles/teachers and any boy or girl -- as well as making things for oneself.  Somehow, I'd feel funny giving parents of three sons (no daughters) a book with this title -- yet it would be absolutely perfect for them, as well as for almost anyone with children and/or a desire to preserve traditions/souvenirs.	2000-12-24

And, although I had looked forward to a book set in Times Square (an area I pass through at least twice each day), I do NOT appreciate sex ed when reading a mystery.  Prior to reading this, I had had no idea what, er, happens to men's bodies (or the nearby furniture) when they go to those sex movie places on Times Square, and was much happier not knowing.	2000-12-24

Great TNT recipes and crafts from all over	I LOVE this book, and everyone on my gift list to whom I have given it has loved it as well.  The recipes are the tried-and-true favorites of Gooseberry Patch's staff members and customers from all over the country.  Almost all are preceded by brief descriptions (usually about why they're family favorites and/or popular with guests), and many have unique packaging ideas. The illustrations are also warm and wonderful (and provide many ideas for one's own gift-giving).<br />This is a warm, wonderful book. I love it, and highly recommend it.	2000-12-24

Although disappointed that the person I considered the most likely killer was, indeed, the murderer, this was a lot of fun to read.  It provided a fascinating glimpse into the world of gospel music (about which I had known less than nothing), and was a very enjoyable book.  I look forward to more from this series.<br />The book focuses on a gospel singer, whose husband deserted her, leaving her with a four year old daughter to raise alone.  Since the child will soon start school, the woman dramatically curtailed her career to keep travel to a minimum and spend as much time as possible with her daughter.  An older, married male friend (also a gospel singer)upon whom she had had a tremendous crush as a young girl is accused of murder, and appears to be the most likely candidate.  Not knowing anyone else in the small town, he calls her from jail begging for help.<br />My only complaint is that the price seems awfully hefty for a paperback book -- with a real waste of paper since each chapter starts on the right-hand page, regardless of whether that causes the preceding page to be blank.  However, the text was very easy to read, which would be important to many senior citizens and people with vision problems.<br />Personally, I think that Planned Parenthood would be wise to recommend this book.  Reading about the main character's endlessly whining four year old does not exactly make one long to give birth.	2000-12-24

This book was a huge disappointment.  It is a very thin paperback with a plastic comb binding, just like millions of charity/church cookbooks across America -- but at 3-4 times the price for this flimsy a book.  The recipes are apparently untested collected from the authors' friends/families; many give vague directions.  Most appear to have been copied from the internet (or, at least, are the same ones plastered all over the net) -- same old, same old.  Worst, the authors address copyrighted information by acknowledging that they don't know the sources of poems/quotes. ...

Since the Moosewood Collective is probably the best-known source of vegetarian recipes and cookbooks, I was horrified by the number of recipes containing fish, shellfish, and seafood products (e.g., clam juice). Checking the index for recipes of certain types or using specific ingredients, I was not thrilled to repeatedly find that the recipe in question contained ingredients a vegetarian wouldn't touch.<br />Obviously, this is not a problem for people merely eager to add more veggies and grains to their diets, or for those who eschew meat and poultry, but eat seafood as well as veggies/grains.  However, for those of us who had come to equate Moosewood with vegetarian, this came as a very nasty surprise.

However, she really let us down here by including directions for carving a turkey.

The recipes and crafts didn't seem nearly as well perfected as in the authors other books.  For example, applesauce cinnamon ornaments did not include glue (which makes them much sturdier, smoother, less breakable, and resistant to bugs).

Jewish papercutting is breathtakingly beautiful (and truly in a class by itself; check the internet and/or museums for spectacular samples), so those tips/ techniques are obviously invaluable.  However, the author also includes a great deal of incredibly helpful information that would enhance any style of papercutting -- and which, strangely enough, I have not seen covered in any of my other books.<br />My one and only complaint is that it isn't a hardcover.

Others were ads with 800 numbers to order cookies, etc. (rather than giving recipes to make your own, perhaps with ordering as another option).<br />Even at $ 5.99 plus shipping, this flimsy paperback is grossly overpriced (e.g., two words per page for things like &quot;picture frames&quot;).

The reviewer described it as the first mainstream mystery featuring a lesbian which would appeal to everyone (regardless of sexual preference).  Since it took place in Greenwich Village (where my office was temporarily located at the time), and I guess I was a little curious about the lesbian lifestyle, I bought it.<br />It was excellent.  Despite having always considered myself very thoughtful and broadminded, I was surprised at how many problems gays face that would never have occurred to me.<br />I also loved the Village setting.  My office was temporarily located there at the time, and the book mentioned sites which had hitherto confused me (e.g., a large unmarked building which always had people coming and going turned out to be the Gay and Lesbian Center).  <br />In short, apart from the mystery, it provided an excellent glimpse into a very different world.  I highly recommend it.	2000-10-18

I don't know about you, but when I'm reading a MYSTERY, I don't expect to read about the color of the characters' hair in private anatomical parts, if you get my drift.  (The author described it graphically, which I found very offensive.)<br />After reading this book, I dropped the series like a hot potato.  Too bad, since the first book was very good, and provided a very thought-provoking glimpse into the lives of lesbians (which would hopefully lead to better understanding and acceptance).  But, as a heterosexual, I found this book much too graphic for me.  Yuck.	2000-10-18

It was filled with very crude language, and the plot seemed ridiculously contrived.  The character was very interesting, and this could be the beginning of a great series if the  language were not so foul, and the plot were a little more believable.	2000-06-25

It is great fun to see the Sinatras' and other celebrities' favorite dishes, especially the little explanatory anecdotes that precede many of them.<br />I have only tried one recipe so far (Pat  Boone's Grammy's Chili Mac) -- but that, alone, was well worth the entire  price of the book. (After tasting it, I readily understand why Clark Gable  loved it so much.)<br />Right now, I'm ordering three copies to send as gifts.	2000-04-01

Uniquely beautiful ways to make &amp; display cranes	I ordered this book after seeing it mentioned on an origami mailing list.  I like it very much.  It includes 24x35-inches beautifully patterned washi paper, directions for both traditionally-folded cranes and for a  quick-and-easy crane ideal for making connected cranes, tips for rokoan  style folding, models for 26 styles of connected cranes (including a mini  room divider), and four ideas for presentation/display.<br />Although my  primary interest is in making thousand crane plaques (which are not  included), the models are nonetheless beautiful.  Someday, I hope to be  able to make their spectacular Seikaiha (Blue Ocean Wave).  Fortunately,  however, the book says that the Tsuri Fune (FIshing Boat) is fairly easy to  make -- and it, too, is very beautiful.<br />In short, I love this book, and  highly recommend it to anyone interested in this form of origami.  It  offers a wide variety of beautiful cranes, and uniquely beautiful ways to  make and display them.	2000-01-25
