I found out he was right - the book is extremely well-written and its contribution to my understanding of the subject is invaluable.<br /><br />As it happened, I partly read older versions of the book to find out how every few years Mr. Daft updates his analysis, insights and examples of the ever changing and evolving world of organizations; for instance, the past example of IBM that served as the major opening example of an organization that has gone from the top of the world to the brink of disintegration in the beginning of the 90's (and since then regained leading position in its areas of expertise), is replaced in this 8th edition with Xerox. Mr. Daft continues and presents the most recent developments in organizations' design - structures and management methods that have only emerged lately in response to the turbulences in the environments and competition worldwide.<br /><br />By making the changes and improvements in every edition \\"Organization theory and design\\" wins the title of this review - \\"the learning book\\" - that mirror images the main theme of this work - \\"the learning organization\\". Almost no organization can stand still in today's reality - managers and workers have to constantly think of better ways of doing things and learn from every source that bears knowledge and can give the organization a better competitive advantage. Things have never moved so fast and threats and opportunities have never been so immense. Competitors have to be efficient and different to survive and stay on the top.<br /><br />The structure of the book is designed to convey its ideas in the best possible manner: Each and every chapter opens with an example illustrating its content, then an introduction to the subject. Theory and examples from today's organizational world followa and are interwoven throughout the text in the \\"in practice\\" section. A fascinating section is \\"leading by design\\" in which Mr. Daft highlights top-of-the-line companies that have managed to materialize the theory and consequently lead their industries. Yet another remarkable feature is \\"bookmark\\" in which the autohor recommends and actually reviews the content of other books that further develop the subject the chapter dealt with. For me, the magnitude of this behavior is unprecedented; I haven't read a book that is so much interested in advancing and advertising works of fellow authors. This is a code of conduct every author can learn from in pursuing the ultimate goal - to better inform and educate his/her readers.<br /><br />Some of the material the book covers include the organizational environment, organizational structures, organizational decision making processes, ethics, organization-decline and organizational politics.<br /><br />As is the norm in many books, Mr. Daft integrates case studies directly connected to the content of each chapter in its end. They add all the more to the reality dimension that is so strong throughout the book.<br /><br />Lastly, the price of this book is somewhat expensive but well worth the money and will certainly prove to be a wise investment. Years after its reaing and studying it may serve as a reference source when the reader will stumble across situations covered in the book and learn to appreciate even more the lessons insights Mr. daft offers.to the subject.

US	49074907	R3EH1DEPS1WVTR	1864503440	732270182	Lonely Planet Austria	Books	5	14	17	N	N	Austria the beautiful	\\"Lonely Planet Austria\\" by Mark Honan is a very good choice if you want to go to Austria.<br /><br />My strongest recommendation (that is obviously true regarding every trip) is not only to read the book as extensively as possible before hitting the road, but also to take the time and sum up all the facts in an easy access manner. You have to realize in advance that this book aims exactly at providing you - the serious traveler - the best and most accurate information - and you will have to invest your energy to become well informed. The entire country is covered and almost all the major cities and towns reports include detailed maps.<br /><br />The grandeur of Vienna -<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />What a beautiful city. It's almost beyond words. The magnificent buildings and churches, the museums, the opera houses and the residents...it seems like a dream to live in such a setting. The book does a great job in mentioning the best places to see and it even gave me the idea to go to the opera a decision that turned out to be one of the highlights of the entire trip; it pointed out the fact that opera is not as expensive as people might think - and in Austria anyone can afford it. The language is German but the music speaks all languages; imagine a stage occupied by a choral group of 80 singers, 60 instruments performers and 10 male and female soloists - and all of them are there to give you a few of the best hours of your life. A show not to be forgotten, I can assure you.<br /><br />Bear in mind that Vienna has one of the best public transportation systems you can find; it's like having your own limousine at 5 Euros per day! A tram stops at a given station almost every 30 seconds, the subway (U-Bahn) will get you anywhere in no time and the local buses complete the comprehensive coverage of the city.<br /><br />My advice for you, if you have the time on your hands, is to get lost in the city for a few hours. Forget about the maps and plans and just see what the city has to offer - by surprise. It can be quite an experience - and when you want to return to your hotel just jump on the closest U-Bahn or tram. No matter where, people will be delighted to help you to find your way, and more than once when I needed information people did their best to give me guidelines and explanations.<br /><br />It should be noted that the Vienna map the book provides is good for locating places it recommends but not so much for getting around while there. Good maps can be found in the hotels and I would also suggest the B & B Vienna laminated map.<br /><br />Other places that worth a visit -<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Salzburg is the second city that is famous around the world when it comes to Austria. The city in which Mozart was born in is situated in a lovely and ideal area and is a great choice to for having a day tour and spending time in the evenings (after exploring the vicinity that includes some of the most dazzling places in the country.<br /><br />Sixty kilometers (38 miles) south east of Salzburg, built on the shore of a lake and on the Alpine slopes lies Hallstatt, a village that  bears one of the most striking outlooks I've ever seen; the surrounding area is so fantastic that I've had the feeling that I'd come to heaven. Just walk or drive around to get a new perception on beauty.<br /><br />Graz is a wonderful city in the south east part of the country; it has a lot to offer when it comes to traveling around and celebrating in the nights, and in addition is a recommended gateway for exploring the surrounding countryside.<br /><br />Skiing -<br /><br />-------<br /><br />Austria has some amazing down-hill ski (or alpine skiing) sites for all levels of expertise. The guide gives some information on selected locations - but you should seek out more sources if your aim is a ski vacation. The best I can offer is to use the phone (numbers are given all over the book) and ask about prices, instructors and equipment for the most precise info. Myself, I've been to Kitzbuel and I can't forget how beautiful it was. You should also remember that in the winter there are cross-country ski possibilities all over the Austrian Alpines and they serve as a great way to see the country in a somewhat different manner.<br /><br />===============================================================<br /><br />Final note -<br /><br />------------<br /><br />The trip in Austria has risen beyond my expectations in each and every parameter I can think of. If you wish to experience a close to perfect vacation - Austria is the place and \\"Lonely Planet Austria\\" is the guide. Lastly, remember the axiom - \\"the west you go the higher the prices get\\" - and Austria is in the eastern side of western Europe - which means accordingly that prices are  lower compared to countries like France, The Netherlands and The U.K., a fact that is all the more encouraging...ces, instructors and equipment for the most precise info.

Kaplan's \\"GMAT\\" book is good for getting into the right state of mind needed to succeed in the test and learning the powerful strategies for solving the hard questions. The strategies are similar (if not identical) to the strategies given in the Princeton Review book, though the latter explains some of the techniques better (and there lies the strength of the Princeton Review).<br />The CD-ROM is the heart of the bargain.<br />Packed with hundreds of questions and explanations, this CD provides countless hours of invaluable practice. In fact, the CDs of other companies I checked out don't begin to compare to Kaplan's.<br />Nevertheless, there are two things you need to know in advance so that you won't be disheartened once you start working on the CD:<br />The first is Kaplan's motto - \\"no pain no gain\\". Once you begin solving tests you'll discover that they are painfully difficult. The level of the tests' questions sometimes rises above the level of the real GMAT questions, but only sometimes. Bear in mind that the actual test is very hard and is made to challenge everyone, therefore it's mandatory not to be intimidated and to experience as many hard questions as possible.<br />The second important thing is to remember that the test scores they supply are no way near the actual results you will eventually get on test day, probably because they use a different score calculating method from the one ETS uses. The reason for this might be rooted in the book and CD makers' possible goal - though not state out loud - to draw you to enroll in one of their preparation courses. Take my word for it, after seeing results for your first scored test - you WILL want to sign in immediately. Remember to take it in perspective.<br />To sum it all up, keep in mind that as long as you make progress and keep on getting better results in adaptive tests from different sources you're on the road to success.	2004-04-21

Contrary to Peterson's \\"GMAT CAT Success\\" (which I also reviewed), the strength of this bargain lies in its book and NOT in the tests provided on the CD-ROM and in the Internet site (read on to find out why). There's a solution for this problem ? Princeton offers the same book without the CD. That way you'll be able to avoid the extra money that they charge for the lousy CD.<br /><br />The Book :<br />-------------<br />The math sections -<br /><br />First and foremost, the book will try helping you to create the state of mind needed to succeed in the GMAT. It goes down hard on ETS - your opponents - whenever it can. It makes you realize and accept the fact that their main goal is to make you fail in the test. It's a war of minds - your mind against the test makers' minds.<br /><br />Second, it introduces a few powerful techniques such as process of elimination, plugging numbers to the cosmic problems and working backwards, that serve as invaluable source for cracking the hard questions and saving precious time. The examples that follow are very good and help to master these techniques.<br /> Third, the theoretical math material given is extensive but not sufficient. You'll still need to check out other sources such as the free software of ETS to get a complete picture.<br /><br />The verbal section -<br /><br />The writers have done a good job in categorizing not only the kinds of questions you're going to meet, but also the kinds of mistakes that are common in this section. Nevertheless, the key for cracking this part is to do as many examples as one can - and that's why other sources are required.<br /><br />The writing assessment section -<br /><br />There are 26 pages of a comprehensive guide for this section in the test. It seems that the authors have invested a considerable amount of energy in this section that is overlooked in some books, probably because it doesn't't contribute to the general score in the test.<br /><br />If you want to focus on this area I recommend buying a book that concentrate on the verbal section to get even more material.<br /><br />The Internet Extra Help :<br />------------------------------<br />This option gives you access to 4 online tests and a GMAT discussion board. The tests are relatively easy; they will not represent your performance on test day, nor will they let you access explanations of mistakes you might have. On the other hand, the discussion board might be of genuine help, as people that have taken the test come over there and share their experience and interest free advices.<br /><br />The CD-ROM :<br />-------------------<br />The CD is the weakest link; Once installed, you'll find warm up questions and 4 tests that don't begin to compare to the level of the actual GMAT. Pay attention that in order to find the answers to the (rather easy) questions you will have to click on the anwer themselves.<br /><br />To improve their merchandise I would urge Princeton's staff to start thinking of thought-provoking questions.

Checking out the content of this book will reveal the fact that it's almost useless; Not only is the theoretical material incomplete (to say the least), but also the examples and test-like questions given  are too easy.<br />However, the CD-ROM is the bonus and the heart of the bargain; it is one of the best I've used and it includes a feature that cannot be found elsewhere. By and large, the useful material on the CD are the tests - you get to take 6 full-length adaptive tests that are similar in level to the real GMAT. The extra-value of these tests is the feedback offered after taking them; you can get information not only about your general score, but also about the level of difficulty of each question you solved. The score you will get is a good approximation to the score you'll get on the real GMAT.<br />Bottom line - 5 stars for the tests and one star for the book.<br />The 2004 and the 2003 versions of the book and CD are identical, so you can be satisfied with a used version and save some bucks.	2004-04-09

The Math Section -<br />------------------<br />ETS's \\"GMAT\\" is valuable for its math review; it's one of the most comprehensive and thorough reviews I've read - and this is its strongest link. Nevertheless, it looks as if most (if not all) this background material is included also in the \\"Powerprep\\" software that is sent to you upon registration to the test. Bear in mind that the software also includes tests with many questions you've probably done if you have solved the questions in the book. The result is a score that does not represent your actual performance on test day.<br /><br />There are well-explained answers to each of the questions (ones you won't find to the practice tests of the sofeware) that help to develop knowledge and understanding. Even so, the biggest problem this book has is the fact that - although it has many questions - there is no indication about their level of difficulty - and this is a major drawback. I wasted a considerable amount of time doing easy to mid-level questions I shouldn't have done at all. Some people commented here that one should do the last third of questions - but the writers of this book failed to include this important piece of information.<br /><br />All the above comes to show that you should not be impressed with the large number of questions the book offers (274 questions on data sufficiency and 441 questions on problem solving) - most of which would hardly advance you. The logical conclusion you can draw from all of this is that it is imperative to buy other preparation books (such as Kaplan's \\"GMAT\\" and Peterson's \\"GMAT CAT success\\" which I also reviewed).<br /><br />Another key disadvantage is the lack of some powerful test taking strategies and techniques that are included in other books and help a lot to crack a few types of the harder questions.<br /><br />If ETS really wants to help test takers it should make considerable changes and improvements in this book.<br />The verbal section -<br />------------------<br />In this section, the examples abound on all subjects, but still, for better constructed and analyzed material you should seek out other sources. It's evident the writers haven't spent much time shaping a system that will categorize different kinds of questions and suggest general guidelines for dealing with them.<br />Analysis of an issue and analysis of an argument -<br />------------------------------------------------<br />These sections are quite poor in substance. They offer 3 scored compositions for each section in addition to explanations of the scores. Other than that, all you get are many pages of possible subjects for analysis for your practice. My advice is to look on the bright side, as this book is the only one I know of that actually scaled and analyzed test takers' essays.section, the examples abound on all subjects, but still, for better constructed and analyzed material you should seek out other sources.

Actual rating - 2.5 stars.<br />The Math Sections -<br />----------------------<br /><br />The most important piece of information that is excluded from the editorial overview is the fact that most - if not all - the questions included in the math sections appear as part of tests given in the CD-ROM attached to the main preparation book Kaplan offers called &quot;GMAT&quot;. In other words, the math part of this book is a printed edition of many questions that are explained exactly in the same way in the CD.<br /><br />There is no any substantial additional material, except for a forward before some questions, emphasizing their exceptional difficulty, and occasional notes indicating how &quot;an 800 test taker&quot; would deal with the questions.<br /><br />In all, I wouldn't recommend this book to somebody who wants to improve his math skills if he's already bought Kaplan's excellent &quot;GMAT&quot; with the CD-ROM.<br /><br />The Verbal sections -<br />-----------------------<br /><br />I can't say here what I said above (about the same questions given in both this book and the CD-ROM of &quot;GMAT&quot;) because I haven't completed all the exercises offered in the CD-ROM. As for the material itself, it seems that the writers did very well in here, since there is an in-depth analysis of the hardest types of questions in the critical reasoning, reading comprehension and sentence correction.<br /><br />To sum up, if your weak link is your performance in the verbal sections - and if you prefer written material to a computer screen - this book can be of help (though you should check out first their outstanding CD-ROM, that offers more material than any other CD I've tried, and decide whether it's enough or not).	2004-04-05

I started with his greatest, \\"The stand\\", and went on to some of his finest creations. I used to have high regard to the way he poured life into his characters and created solid stories that illuminated many aspects of human nature in the most fascinating way. I still appreciate those books and they stand the test of time.<br />Having read his latest books I can't escape the thought the he may have fallen from grace, or/and I just grew older and what he does no longer attract me as an older person.<br />=============================================================<br />The beginning of \\"From a Buick 8\\" was promising; I sensed the old sparkle that captivated me in my youth and was delighted to go with the flow of King's writing. Alas, after a few tens of pages the story just dragged and I made an effort to finish it - firstly, to see whether there would be an improvement later on, and secondly, to be able to give a report to you, the potential reader. It turned up that the events described continued to be uninspiring. The characters were not special or enthralling to such a degree that it is quite hard now to point a finger on someone that is worth mentioning. To my best understanding and discernment, the fact that King had chosen too ordinary personas to populate his book had a strong effect on the curiosity and appeal the work generated as a whole.<br />Even so, I found some places where the wisdom of King penetrated to the story as used to be the case in his greatest books of the past. The fact that he managed to bring himself to write a number of important anecdotes that made me think for a while - made the book a little more than a regular page turner. These things should have contributed to the advancement and impact of the general plot, functioning as a sidekick to boost the reader's interest, but they did it only to a limited extent.<br />Sadly, I predict that you will forget the story a few hours after reading it.<br />=============================================================<br />I feel like the current King belongs to my past now. That does not diminish his contribution to my admiration for the art of writing, and I will always remember the significant roll his books played in its development.y a few hours after reading it. <br />=============================================================<br />I feel like the current King belongs to my past now.

In many ways, it's very hard to understand how Stephen King, a decent family man and a law-abiding citizen, can come up with stories that have, in addition to remarkable characterization and wonderful prose, unbelievably gruesome and violent scenes a common reader would never have imagined on his own. This novel is an endeavor King makes to shade some light on the cognitive processes inside his brain.<br />For that end he tells the story of Thad Beaumont, a bestseller author - only thanks to his pseudonym, George Stark. King illustrates a creepy tale about Beaumont's dark half / twin brother that comes to life and wears a devilish form when \\"his\\" other half decides to terminate his fictional existence. This is a brilliant means in demonstrating the duality of King's personality, which stands on even a higher ground as King himself has had a nom de plume - Richard Bachman - and evidently he writes from a first-rate experience.<br />If you want to know how some people can write about things that are completely detached from their world - try King's explanation.<br />=============================================================<br />By and large, this book is a fast read. There is a certain amount of depth to it, but much less than what his fans would expect; the best way to describe it is to call it \\"a psyichological action novel with a few horror twists\\". The major events are set in a scope of two to three days and as a result the rhythm is quick and leaves little room for thorough character development; I have almost zero information about the major events in Thad's childhood that shaped him as a man, not to speak about a better and fuller characterization of his wife, father and mother, not to mention the Sheriff that was an integral part of the story. In other novels, King has demonstrated his talent to orchestrate complicated creations that had it all - they have been a lot longer, but it was always worth the extra reading effort.<br />Strange enough, the mysterious character the pseudonym author in book created strikes me as a very interesting, but sadly it is the least developed character of them all. The good news, however, is that King has borrowed this character from the novel \\"Dead City\\" by Shane Stevens to pay tribute to this author, so anyone can read more about the notorious Alexis Machine...<br />============================================================<br />In the past I was told that this book is one of King's scariest. It could have been the case for me - had I read it a few years ago - but it is certainly not the case today. Maybe I got so used to King's style that he can't really get under my skin as he used to - I guess I grew up.<br />Yet, now that the horror he tries to create is not so horrifying anymore, I can pay a closer attention to his language; the man really knows how to describe things. King's admirable ability to put what he sees and feels into words is a wonderful way for the reader to learn and improve his own means of expression.<br />For that and for the above positive points I recommend this book as a pastime and a light read.rious character the pseudonym author in book created strikes me as a very interesting, but sadly it is the least developed character of them all.

The dreadfulness, terror and shock that originate in the imagination of horror novelists can never begin to compare to the real events that happened during World War II, in a time that is widely referred to as the Holocaust.<br />\\"Night\\" is about the true and terrifying events that Eli Wiesel has gone through during those days.<br />Inside, you are going to meet the young Elie Wiesel, born in the town of Sighet, Romania, presumably into a good life. Then you'll meet the phenomenon of denial among the Jewish people; so many had never believed the reports about the horrible activities of the Germans and of the other European nations during the War - until it became their fate as well.<br />This pitiful and destructive denial continues even while being transferred like cattle to concentration camps, through the first revelations of brutal and barbaric behavior amid the Jews themselves in the face of inhumane conditions. Their eyes are finally opened only in front of the gates of hell - the crematoriums of Auschwitz.<br />Having survived the selections there, Wiesel continues to live on and witnesses atrocities, loss, immense pain and sadness in different concentration and death camps, and comes to questioning everything he has ever learned in his short life to that point.<br />=============================================================<br />Why would you want to spend your time reading something that horrible?<br />You probably have general information about the atrocities that took place in those cursed days; having seen films like \\"The Schindler's List\\" you have an idea about how it was like. Having seen documentaries with interviews of survivors might add some more knowledge to your overall concept about what it was like.<br />Reading books about it is the next step.<br />There is always something new that a person hasn't heard of, probably would never have imagined and that cannot be conveyed via the visual media. Furthermore, reading a book is quite different from seeing a film in the sense that one gets the chance to crawl into the mind of a person that has been through this unprecedented ordeal. What one may discover about human nature - both of the murderers and their victims - may be extremely upsetting and difficult to grasp.<br />Why is it important to read this book and others like it?<br />To remember that it happened and to do as much as anyone can do to never let it happen again.<br />=============================================================<br />In the end of the last paragraph I almost added, \\"to pray to God it would never happen again\\", but then again I remembered how God was awfully quite as it was all taking place. I don't know where God was during those times, but Wiesel gives his answer that comes from within, while witnessing the hanging of a young boy: \\"Where is He? Here He is - He is hanging here on the gallows...\\"<br />Yes, in the aftermath of the Holocaust there was a sweeping faith crisis; the concept of God and the belief in mighty powers became a problem among the Jewish people, and as I've learned during my latest trip, among many Europeans as well. How could He let it happen? Why? Where was He? And ultimately, should the people that suffered to an unparalleled extent forgive Him? Can they? Who should they blame?<br />=============================================================<br />In this shocking account you will not find the answers for these questions.<br />The conclusion you may draw in the end of the day is that it's up to us to protect ourselves. We can trust ourselves - and ourselves only - in the fight against the forces that wish to destroy us.that cannot be conveyed via the visual media.

I don't know if or when any of you is going to find himself / herself in this particular area, but anyway here it is...<br />This is the latest edition (8th) that was released only about a year ago. Things really changed in this edition compared to its predecessor; more authors are involved and new and updated information is added (though many sections remain).<br />Important note: When it comes to Myanmar, things can change for better or worse overnight due to the nature of the ruling government, while some other things tend to stay the same. Especially here, pay close attention to all the small details given in the chapters \\"Facts for the visitor\\", \\"Getting there and away\\" and \\"Getting around\\" - they matter greatly.<br />=============================================================<br />As a whole, the guide will be a valuable asset for you if you're planning on traveling there, and there is absolutely no doubt whether to buy it or not - it's an essential purchase. To a great extent it will help you plan your budget, your destinations, how to get there and when, what to bring and so forth.<br />You should know that there are some beautiful places to visit in the country. One of them, the Shwedagon Paya in Yangon, strikes me as one of the most beautiful man made structures in the world. Imagine a 100 meters high Stupa (Buddhist religious monument), all covered with golden leaves, set on top of a hill, in the center of smaller golden temples and Buddha statues. The sight was breathtaking and alone was worth coming. Another famous place, yet less astounding, is Bagan, the city of Stupas in the north. There you can find numerous Stupas some of which were built more than 1000 ago. And yes, almost in every city and town you will see at least one golden Stupa (that immensely contradict the poverty of the people) that give Myanmar the name \\"The Golden Land\\".<br />The tagline on the cover of this book is \\"should you go?\\" It is misleading due to the fact that the answer they give inside is \\"yes\\". If you want to go - go, the political status is not of your concern, you're a traveler not a world freedom fighter. You wouldn't help the local people by avoiding the country - they benefit from your staying there - and that is all that you should care about.<br />Nevertheless, the authors don't really prepare you for the level of poverty you're going to meet there (the same way another author hasn't done in the Cambodia book yet); this is one of the poorest countries in the world and that's why you should always be careful and never trust anybody - they're there for your money (mostly). I really don't like, after being around, the attitude of \\"the locals are so nice and we can learn so much from them\\"; some of them are really nice and helpful, but others are nice because you spend your money there and it's downright blatant. Expect it; don't fall for it and BE CAREFUL of forced and immediate friendliness. Remember that as a tourist you're regarded as very rich and compared to them you are.<br />I want to mention the fact that as a traveler and a guest you will receive the best services even in budget hotels - they treated my friend and me like royalty in each and every hotel, and that was something we really enjoyed and appreciated. It's the best service all over South East Asia, and it does say something about the people as a nation.<br />I hope their days of freedom will come soon. ...they give inside is \\"yes\\".

US	49074907	R2ISLSARINUP7Y	3897071711	526663146	Berndtson & Berndtson Thailand Map	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A good map - but no subtitles in Thai.	In my list, this is the second best map of Thailand that I've come across. The main reason for this status is the durability of the map and its colorful nature: this map is laminated and therefore is waterproof, draw-able (you can mark your route on the map and wipe it off at will), hard to be torn apart and its colors are vivid and make it very nice to look at. Aside from that, it's very nice to handle thanks to its scale of 1:1,750,000. You will also find a Bangkok 1:100,000-scale map that will not be of use due to its small size and under detailed nature (dont worry, as you'll get a free copy at the airport).<br />On the other hand, nothing compensates for the fact that there are no Thai subtitles for the names of the places side by side to the English names, especially in a country where so many locals don't speak or read English. For that reason, the Michelin Map (check out my review) is the best choice.	2003-03-03

This is the most useful map I could find about Thailand, but it's not the most comfortable or durable one, for convenience go for the B & B Map (check out my review about that map).<br />The best and unbeatable advantage of this map (yet) is that the names of the places on the map are written both in English AND in Thai. Clearly, this is a valuable asset in a country where many locals don't speak (not to say read) the language. For this plus point this map is the best choice hands down.<br />Downsizes:<br />This map is big due to its scale of 1:1,400,000 (the biggest in the market) that can be a little clumsy at certain times but allow the existence of many details. Take into account the fact that it's not laminated (unlike the runner up B& B) and therefore not waterproof<br />Another disadvantage is the fact that there are no city maps alongside the main Thailand map as there are in the maps of most of the competitors. About that I can reveal the fact that in the main cites and islands you will get free copies of similar maps - so the only map you'll really need is the full-size map of Thailand.	2003-03-03
US	49074907	R2S4JQ0M7NUBAZ	0864427050	990023623	Lonely Planet Netherlands	Books	4	18	21	N	N	Comprehensive and thorough, but prices are outdated.	General background -<br />================<br />The Lonely Planet Guides contain a lot of information. They are supposed to be of help to the common backpacker. However, due to the extensive coverage they offer about the countries they discuss, they can also be a very good source of information to travelers with greater means that are interested in a thorough coverage of their destination. Moreover, they can be of use to persons that are interested in learning about the country as a starting point for further studies.<br />When the reader wishes to travel he has two options of dealing with the wide-ranging material:<br />1. To read the book almost cover to cover in advance, aiming at planning the trip down to the last small detail while learning a lot about the country - culture, history, climate, geography, conduct and so forth.<br />2. To read the essential highlights from the book using the contents - in a relatively short time - aiming at learning the basic information needed for getting a good head start (forget about the long \\"facts About\\" chapter). Upon getting there it is easy to use the guide on a daily basis for further information.<br />The guide -<br />========<br />This guide is a very good one with one major flaw that can't be disregarded: the prices are given in Guilders, more than a year (!) after the country has completely converted to Euros, since the edition hasn't been updated since the 1st of January 2001. That fact poses a great difficulty at planning the budget for the trip (add to that the considerable rise of prices since the transition to the Euro). This is a serious letdown and not something you would expect from a distinguished publication house. Hopefully they will release a second edition soon.<br />Aside from the problem mentioned above, the guide is a real help for the traveler; the information and recommendations in the different sections were most helpful and the proved accurate. A good example is the emphasis that is given to a certain rental bike service at Amsterdam that offers no advertising for itself on the bicycle, and keeps many preying eyes away from the bike. The pictures presented inside are well taken and offer a beautiful glance at what the reader might see during his journey. The guide contains the wide assortment of maps of many important and interesting towns and cities the reader might visit with the familiar marking of the recommended places to see/eat/sleep.<br />I would like to point out that not all the best places to visit are pointed out in the book. I reckon they can't put everything inside and they should and do promote self-exploration. I walked around for hours in each and every place I've visited and was rejoiced to find buildings and corners that were breathtaking - on my own. I recommend you to do the same as in some cases - owning to the desire to stay compact and still comprehensive - the book provides rough guidelines that are superficial and personal opinions that might not always suit your taste.<br />The chapters about the Netherlands in general and the special boxed texts scattered throughout the book are very interesting and are best read during the trip to answer questions that may pop up. By and large, one will have time for that only once he is home and has the special interest in the country he has just visited.<br />Amsterdam-<br />-------------<br />The Amsterdam chapter may be the most important to the common traveler, simply because there is so much to see and do there. The guide offers good and detailed maps of the city, but too bad they are divided to small maps that are made to fit into the book like regular pages, rather than giving the readers a folded map they would be able to take out for their own convenience. That leaves no choice but to buy a map at the local shops, a reality Lonely Planet can change in the next edition.<br />As to the content itself, it's a mixed bag. They do provide top-notch info but also tend to exaggerate sometimes in describing places up to a tiresome point. The pages about the transportation possibilities are thorough. In the end of the day, it is more than enough and you wouldn't need the Lonely Planet's Amsterdam guide if you don't plan to live there more than a week or two.<br />Final note -<br />========<br />The Netherlands is a strikingly beautiful country. The cities as well as the countryside are absolutely dazzling, and the people are friendly and helpful. I enjoyed traveling in the land so much that I consider it the peak of my long trip that had been mainly to the countries of South East Asia. This guide contributed a lot to the general feeling I got thanks to all its good graces.cribing places up to a tiresome point. The pages about the transportation possibilities are thorough.

US	49074907	R1VBSJG9QRPGKL	0553208845	36215520	Siddhartha	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Thought provoking , enlightening and puzzling .	Background .<br />--------------<br />Hesse's Siddhartha is a special kind of hero and a controversial one . Unlike the more regular type of protagonists that fight the elements , other humans and themselves in the process , Siddhartha's struggle is almost completely internal . Born with the graces of looks , wealth , charisma and high intelligence - he can't ever complain about or deal with any underdog position like most of the others I've come across in the past . Nonetheless , he is not happy with what he has got , nor is he satisfied . The book tells his path to achieve spiritual redemption .<br />The plot .<br />----------<br />In the book , Siddhartha is described as a free soul that is connected to everything - but not REALLY connected to anything - except for his chase after inner peace and truth . He is the ultimate happiness seeker you will ever find ; His journey begins as he and his friend Govinda leave his biological family and the company of Brahmins , in which they were raised to join the Samanas , the cult of the ascetics . After a while , he realizes that this is not his place . Toward the end of hanging around with the extremists of the spirituality seekers , he gets the chance to meet the famous Buddha , named also Gotama , which he learns to admire . Nevertheless , pretty soon he manages to throw a doubt upon the Guru's philosophy and way of life , and decides to move on .<br />He then leaves everything behind for the second time - to pursue the material pleasures the world offers . Naturally for his kind of a character , he takes it to the extreme - as he always try to get to the bottom of things - only to find out how empty his soul has turned out , when he finds out he can't think anymore , lost many of his graces and is just mundane like everybody else in his sphere of conduct . Disgusted by what he has become , he braces himself and restarts to wander again , almost loses interest in life , to finally find the inner peace he has looked for - some would say - in one of the most unlikely places of all ...<br />There are many gems that are interwoven in the story . The ones that immediately come to mind are the enlightening description of what a gambler goes through during his addiction , and the insight about the process of teaching that many times involves revealing only one side of the story to make the effort possible .<br />The book is quite short , but reads like a long one . The main reasons for this is that every page or two bear the need for a full stoppage to understand the self illuminations and deep messages that are transferred in the text , and the fact that the story sums up the major part of the hero's lifetime in a relatively short scope .<br />Significance .<br />--------------<br />Without a doubt , 'Siddhartha' requires a second reading for better understanding of what it's all about , and even then , many things might wait to be understood - in the course of a lifetime . The significance of the story is so universal and profound , that I guess that at any point in life , can one gain new insights about himself and about the world he is living on .<br />Notwithstanding , in the aftermath of the book , the reader is left wondering , and this is a big problem with the book's concept , message and perspective : Does a person , with similar targets to Siddhartha's , have to try EVERYTHING to achieve inner peacefulness ? Does he have to go through all these trials , tribulations  and powerful , sometimes brutal , emotions and stretch his experiences to the max ? Is an internal journey  - like most go through , without having to actually execute each and every thought and wish they desire - enough to finally get to the same conclusions and ascensions ? How confident of his actions and essence can a person be without challenging himself frequently , and should one really aim at this direction ? Definitely, these are tough questions that are there to be answered during the passage of years .me would say - in one of the most unlikely places of all ...<br />There are many gems that are interwoven in the story .

You've come to the right place .<br />If you're reading these lines , chances you are a Babylon 5 long lost fan , that wandered through the Internet looking for something new regarding the series . If so , I am certain you have always wanted to know the origins of one of the series' most interesting and thrilling 'alien' species . Inside is the beginning of everything you've always wanted to know .<br />This is the story of the Telepaths , the mind readers . Starting with the discovery of their existence , through their gathering to become the formidable and powerful force of the &quot;Psi Corps&quot; . Then , the counter formation of the Resistance , the actions and reactions of both , up until the birth of the most dreadful telepath to be , Alfred Bester .<br />The way I see it now , it's absolutely imperative that every real fan of the series put his hands on this book ; If you really loved the show , there is no better way , nowadays that the program is gone , to keep the flame burning . The moment I got into it , after 20-30 pages or so , I realized this had been what I needed . That resulted in an almost uninterrupted read to the end . Wow , that hasn't happened to me for a long time , but then again , I haven't read fiction books for quite sometime . . .<br />The graces of the book are embodied in keeping the spirit of the Babylon 5 Universe . As Londo Mollari once said , the universe is based on three elements :  spirit , matter and personal interests ; different characters are driven by power hunger on one side , and desire to be free on the other side . One can really see them function as real characters in a B-5 episode .<br />The tension is high , as in the series . Bad and good things happen all the time (depends on your point of view) . The reader can understand the motivations of both sides , and in that the author does a nice job of not openly indicating who the bad guys are and who aren't . You can wind up finishing the reading not knowing who is right and who is wrong , just like in the series (recall Zahadum and the disclosure of the Shadows), and in real life .<br />Let me inform you of what not to expect . First of all , this is not a masterful literature , but more of a script , in case it were to become a movie ; don't expect a thorough and satisfying character development . What Mister Keyes has done here is squeezing something like 70-80 years in 267 pages , with something like eight(!) leading figures to make things going . He could have easily filled in a 500-pageturner with much thicker scope .<br />I think us readers deserve more , but I have to remember , as you have to too , that these kind of books were primarily written aiming at teens , as the style and language represent that aim . Aside from that , there are , of course , the constraints the editors posit in regard to the book's extent and length , so Keyes may not be totally responsible .<br />Don't expect an easy track of the events . The author , in a peculiar way , spared a solid timeline to help us understand who lives and who doesn't and when , not to mention their current age in the time certain events take place . This defect is one of the most irritating misdeeds of the author (there aren't many , by the way), and I truly don't reckon where the editor was when he should have stepped in .<br />To sum everything up , regarding it as a fun and superficial read , without high hopes for a masterful fictional creation , makes it worth the while . I did wind up knowing a lot more about the Corps , and it did satisfy my hunger for knowledge .<br />Watch out for my upcomimg review of the second book of the trilogy in the near future .the reading not knowing who is right and who is wrong , just like in the series (recall Zahadum and the disclosure of the Shadows), and in real life .<br />Let me inform you of what not to expect .

US	49074907	R1RMNKICG2YXDG	0521458676	537079508	Theory of Moves	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Remarkable , thought provoking and inspiring .	To me , \\"Theory of Moves\\" (TOM) is the first academic book I have read cover to cover with great interest  . I discovered this book in the course of the last semester , being one of the must reads for the game theory course I'd taken , and once I got my hands on this book I couldn't wait to have the time to read it thoroughly , a task I completed only lately .<br />Game theory in general and TOM in particular , have given me a new way of looking at the world surrounding me ; I feel like I understand it better than before I've learned to use this logical and rational thinking . Many things look simpler now , since the facts and principals I've learned make them comprehensible , understandable and clearer than before .<br />Prior to reading this book you'd have to have some background on the classical game theory . I learned this background mainly from the booklet of Frank Zagare  that pretty much covered all the main basic principals of the qualitative use of the theory . Morton Davis is also a good choice for beginners , both center on the non-mathematical aspects of the theory which are used to dissect and explain the decisions of players at matters of internal politics ,international relations and everyday's life serious decisions people make .<br />This work represents an extension of game theory that helps to adjust it better to real life , or as Brams puts it : \\"The Theory of Moves brings a dynamic dimension to the classical theory which was defined as static , by postulating that players think ahead not just to the immediate consequences but also to the consequences of the other player's countermove , counter countermove and so on ... TOM extends the strategic thinking into the more distant future . \\"<br />Brams , in his book , gives all the tools needed to learn and understand everything about his fascinating theory . This effort is mostly a summation of more then two decades of trial and error , deep investigations , constant changes and improvements , and examination of a myriad of case studies .<br />The major concepts and issues you are going to read about and be captivated with will start  with the 'Anticipation Problem' , going through 'Magnanimity' with the teasing theme -  \\"it sometimes pays ...\\", 'Moving Power' , 'Order' and 'Threat power' , ending with 'Information Problems' in games such as 'Misperception' (which is enormously intriguing concept to capture) , 'Deception' and 'Omniscience' . There is also an additional chapter that was difficult for me  to understand , in which Brams offers a new model of negotiations .<br />Each chapter is written with the well known form of introduction - theory principals - applications , in addition to a last chapter that concludes the entire book . This design is very helpful since whenever you have problems understanding the theory - you can immediately skip to the examples Brams is generous with giving - and solve all the unclear points instantly . As for the style itself , we're dealing here with a first class author that has the outstanding ability to keep you thrilled all along the reading effort , winding up asking for more ...<br />From what I've gathered so far this is the best book you can get about this brilliant extension .

US	49074907	R6B0XTCA7AB7W	0195119541	637840108	Environmental Economics	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Great introduction to Environmental Economics	Actual rating - 4.5 stars.<br /><br />I have read this book as a must-read for the Environmental Economics course I had taken in the beginning of the last semester.<br />I think this book is a great choice for students that are interested in the topic. I didn't know what to expect in the beginning of the course, but it turned up to be surprisingly interesting and important  - with the good help of this book.<br /><br />I have to say I've learned a lot from reading this book, and that it has been a pleasant experience. Professor Kolstad has really  accomplished a commendable achievement in writing a fluent, methodical and thorough book about Environmental Economics, nearly anyone can read and understand .<br /><br />I write this as a student who hasn't read other works on the subject but nevertheless feels this book has many pluses as an introductory tool:<br /><br />- The author makes far-reaching efforts to explain nearly every statement he proclaims (although announcing the book is despite  announcing the book for persons that have taken an Intermediate Microeconomics courses in the beginning). These explanations are useful as reminders of forgotten material, excluding the need to use fundamental books for better understanding.<br /><br />- Significant number of chapters include only a moderate use of mathematical tools. This may serve as a considerable help for the layman who is intimidated by many mathematical formulas,<br /> and just wishes to expand horizons.<br /><br />I believe the following points characterize many tutorials, but feel it's important to note them anyway;<br /><br />- Every figure the author uses is accompanied with detailed explanations that improve the reader's ability to understand the sketch above is and the whole subject in the process.<br /><br />- Every chapter includes an introduction and a summery:<br />The first one connects the upcoming chapter to the previous one and assists in understanding the place it will take in the big picture of things.<br />The second one summarizes the major issues dealt with in the chapter. This method organizes the material and construct an understandable structure of knowledge.<br /><br />The one last thing is the appearance of questions and problems in the end of each chapter aiming at helping the reader to check out his understandin - but with the irritating absence of answers and solutions. What's the point in composing personal examinations without any achievable, certified solutions? I recommend authors to attach a booklet/extra pages with the correct answers, along with a full description of the way to the solution plus explanations.<br /><br />Excluding the last disadvantage, I'm most pleased with this book, and would recommend it for anyone who is interested in the environment, economy and its protection problems.<br /><br />**September 2014 updates: A reader has commented the a teachers' booklet exists - get it!chapter.

For starters, this book is the memoirs of a veteran Mosad agent. Even though he is not a professional writer, his book is readable, fluent ,very informative and clear. He divides the book into 3 sectors : Patience (containing 6 chapters), Preparations (also 6 chapters) and Diligence (with 7). Arranging the book's structure that way allows us readers to read and consider each chapter as a stand-alone , no understanding problems occur, and you can read the book in any sequence you desire.<br />How is this possible? By using the basic formula most management prescription writers use: He offers ,first, the lesson/moral that he wishes to point out, explains it theoretically, and then brings the action packed part, which is the main attraction of the book.<br />When we get to the content, the evaluation you would give it depends on who you are.I believe young, enthusiastic readers would find it interesting and inspiring; the action described is in the good old spy story's fashion, along side with real life lessons. Elders, in my opinion, would see it as a one-time entertainment read, because it's fun to read about all the operations the author conducted across the lines, while he was undercover 'in hostile territory',but I think there isn't something new or innovative to experienced business people.<br />Reading the book doesn't aspire to prepare you to the business life ,nor to being a foreign operator; it does give you some mind twisting advises, that are good in general for life .<br />Last thing ,there is an emphasis on the Mosad and of the way it operates , if this interests you, you won't be disappointed.	2001-10-01

I wrote a draft of this composition 4 years ago, and in a way, despite my initial rejection, &quot;Needful Things&quot; has opened my mind. Many times, ideas that are unfamiliar to me, at first, create a very strong resistance and pain within me. In the end, I come at peace with myself when I realize they're true, and there's nothing I could or should do to change them. It's exactly getting out of my old beliefs and growing up. Yes, it is hard, but as it is was said - \\" the future always born in pain\\".<br />This serious and somber novel takes a good look inside the human nature, explores it thoroughly, and comes up with severe consequences.<br />After I'd read the book I realized it poisoned my soul .I didn't think that could happen because of a book, but it did. The horrifying things King had written about, the wickedness and horror influenced me consciously and unconsciously during the reading process.<br /> It is important to me to let you know how I felt back then, because it was bizarre, unusual, and after all, fascinating.<br />Ignoring the supernatural in the novel, you're left with a lesson in decision-making when one is not utterly rational, the natural state of most of us. In here, as in \\"The Stand\\" everyone has to put himself in the place of the characters, decide what he would have done, which option he would have chosen and finally - take a stand.<br />This book stressed the fact that everyone has good and bad inside of him. Yes, it's connected to the desires, interests and needs we all share, but there's more to it. Inside every woman and man there is a silent struggle, between the two mentioned, from time to time.<br />It doesn't really ever end. There are intermissions, it could vanish for a long time, but its bases are there. This is the true nature of things as king see them.<br />King extends, speak of sheer evil. He speaks of taking truly wicked actions in order to achieve this that you want, to let go of any limits and concentrate on the things you've justified and decided to do. The frightening conclusion of them all is that anyone can get down and dirty, and King adds, that once evil has regulated your soul once, there is no way back. You have crossed the lines. There is a thin red line that once you've passed it the road back is almost impossible.<br />As usual in a King's book, he's referring to nothing short but a murder. After killing one man, willingly and intentionally, the barrier breaks. According to King, in that point, some would completely freak out and lose the good they did have before. They are now capable of doing anything you'd imagine.<br />The really interesting part is that sometime there is still good inside A man after doing the unthinkable. This side of him burdens him immensely, trying to pull him back to being rational. This is the barrier of sanity; it can be said that after crossing the lines for the first time, the man loses the very thing that stops him from damaging him and his surroundings. He becomes indifferent to it, and thinks only of himself - his interests and needs.<br />To be precise, in the book I read of so many people who were willing to do horrible deeds, only to satisfy their desires - the object of their affection.<br />It was horrifying to read about the demonical activity of the devil incarnate in the novel, that let hell break loose, and was responsible for everything. The thought that one person can do all that...It is believable...<br />And the way that people had changed in the face of the object they always craved for...Reading it, you have to witness all the filth and ugliness they had kept inside, then transformed it to brutal and gruesome acts. King calls it \\"Selling your soul\\". The idea that a person can lose control of his soul is unequaled in his books.<br />The sides story that stunned me completely was Brad Denfort's.<br />He is characterized as a peace and calm figure, of the ones that never vend anger on anyone, completely non violent, that suddenly, gets up one day, and in attack of sheer uncontrollable wrath bursts at the seams taking down a few others not to mention himself (and not without a reason).<br />This is a terror imposing kind of story, because you instantly reckon - \\"This could happen to me too !\\". You understand what he'd gone through, and why he did what he did, and that's the scariest of them all. Yet, you should remember King aims to cause this reaction, and he is successful...<br />In here ,we get to the bottom of it all. I found the \\"I want to scare the living daylight out of you\\" style very bad for me, though learned here a few formidable lessons. This is a real poisonous glass that harms...<br />In \\"The Stand\\" it was different. There weren't terrible murders and human outbreaks like in here, certainly not like in this form (I mention it because I'd read it prior to NF).<br />The satanic \\"Needful Things\\" is a monstrous, legendary horror, that some could relate to it as, `at its best', but not me. I would avoid such writings in the future to come.up one day, and in attack of sheer uncontrollable wrath bursts at the seams taking down a few others not to mention himself (and not without a reason).<br />This is a terror imposing kind of story, because you instantly reckon - \\"This could happen to me too !\\".

US	49074907	R3U3W37ERTEV4B	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	2	8	8	N	N	Controversial	\\"Dreamcatcer\\" is one of the most controversial books I've read so far. Therefore, I am going to separate my analysis to positive points and to negative points.<br />Let's start with the good news: The story itself is gripping, thrilling and interesting; I actually forced myself to stop reading from time to time, under no circumstances is it boring.<br />The similarities, mainly to \\"IT\\", you may look at it as a sequel, and that way accept the mirror images (I'll refer to this point later on more extensively).<br />The different view King offers of the Down syndrome stricken persons: I have a feeling you're going to look differently at them after you've read the book, and that's a great achievement of the author.<br />And, naturally, the bad news (there are quite a bit)...<br />I have a distinct feeling King has started to recycle himself. It seems he has ran out of good new original ideas for a story; it's kind of sad, but while reading I couldn't help thinking that maybe he'd run out of aces in his sleeve. Not only does he borrow from himself, but he also borrows from others- external influences are apparent. Would you believe he'd been heavily influenced from Chris Carter of the X-Files?<br />The structure and content of the plot resembles in many aspects to \\"IT\\", which is a bit annoying. King starts by introducing four characters - in their prime, but all going through hard time. Surprisingly, their problems are connected to a mutual past experience they had as a group of children. Yes, they had been best friends, done something extraordinary and today, suffer from the implications. The story gets started as they reunite, for a new mission of saving the world.  Sounds familiar?<br />I've read handful of his books, and seen him originating and innovating, creating masterful readings like \\"Bag of bones\\", \\"The stand\\" and \\"The green mile\\". The man has got what it takes, but kind of `blew it' this time in some places. I know he had a rough time after the accident he endured, but this doesn't justify a decline in quality.<br />The inside havoc continues to be revealed in the novel, as he uses extremely violent and foul language extensively throughout the book. Even for a King's book it's way too much. The swearing and cursing are so frequent it's irritating, and, clearly, King exaggerated. Again, you can ascribe it to his physical condition, not to mention his mental state back than, but it is hardly an excuse. The curses and obscenities are so intense that they bring the violence of the book to the level of \\"Needful things\\". To sum up this point, the story gets quite gruesome from time to time, so take this in your considerations when deciding whether to read it or not. If I'd known, I would have passed over this one.<br />Characters - Due to the fact it is a shorter reading compared to \\"IT\\", for instance, there is not enough time to get to know the center characters. This is a major problem of the book, because it's one of the reasons I read Stephen King's books. He is very good in characterizing, describing and, telling stories about the life of his heroes, but here, he was negligent. Suffice to say, I won't miss any of the characters.<br />All in all, the feeling you get while reading the novel is that the author vended a lot of anger, and maybe if you remember this you can accept the faults and fully enjoy the story.ndured, but this doesn't justify a decline in quality.<br />The inside havoc continues to be revealed in the novel, as he uses extremely violent and foul language extensively throughout the book.

Unless you're familiar with the game it wouldnlt work for you as it didn't for me.<br />  It's an ordinary King's,containing some of his recurring motives ,and doesn't really innovate much. The main title is the inclusion of the game in the story ,as a main character . I didn't find it appealing, but as I adressed earlier, others can .<br />  I did not find the overall concept gripping, I actually browsed the book at some parts - for the first time in a King's novel. Maybe that says it all.This work isn't one of his finest, and it seems to me that he wrote it for self entertainment reasons ,since his love of the game is definite.<br />  One more point I would like to bring up is the distinct feeling of a minor reading . The entire story deals with the little kid and her thoughts, most of which don't seem to capture my attention. King hasn't done it for me this time. For instance, in &quot;Insomnia&quot; he touched my feelings ,when he ,so delicately,  described the lives of old folks ,their problems and emotions, but this time it wasn't that successful. I was dissapionted.<br />You might or might not ,but consider carefully before spending your money.	2000-10-08

There were a few times when I'd put it down  not wanting to continue ,but in the end I am happy I finished the book.<br />  All the way I felt there was something strong and deep about this book.  That was the first time I've read a creation of a female writer, and I have  to say I liked it. It's differet from a man's writing. Hamilton had dag  very deep in the process of describing the characters, and the outcome was  overwhelming.<br />  In order to explain why most of the reading have  been so hard, I 'd have to mention the nature of the story : Hamilton had  dealt with carelessness,a dead child ,guilt ,enormous pain ,nerve breakdown  ,accusations of child abuse and the hard and painful emotions people feel  while experiencing ordeal.<br />  As you may understand, It's not a fun  read .You won't relax out of reading this work. As a matter of fact it's  most disturbing. None the less, there is a lot that can be learned. I  have  to admit there were some points I didn't understand myself, being so  complicated,maybe way over my level of development.<br />  All of this come  to show you that this is a powerful, serious work. More than that, there is  a double point of view approach : One of Alice point of view ,and one of  Howard,her husband. This technique is new for me and I've found it most  interesting,  yet another good reason to read this book.<br />  All in all,  try this if you are ready to experience pain and agony and true day to day  feelings of adults in their brave struggle to survive terrible events.	2000-08-05

I've read this piece three years ago,while serving my first year in the israeli defence force . Looking back at this stage of my life I can say  honestly that I was very young, naive ,and &quot;green&quot; . Things have  changed greatly ever since, but some remain the same .  This book came at a  very confusing time for me : I wasn't satisfied with my service and thought  of other options ,one of them was the Israel Marine Commando - our version  of the Navy Seals. This book actually had helped me make up my mind to  dismiss this option.  Don't get the wrong impression. It's a must read  .The first 100 pages are the best I've ever read. The story is so thrilling  ,it's hard to put it down .It made me realize how terrible the status of  the women in our society was and still is. I actually cried out loud in  pain while reading . Those days were exetremly violent in Israel ,every  monday and thursday I'd read about a woman being slaughter ,and felt the  urge to do something ,to fight those killers,to punish them like Kelly  punished the murderer in the book.  In regard to the Commando dilemma ,I  realized they make a killer out of a man. I descided I don't wanna kill  anybody . It's not my way.  Eventually ,the issues the book deals with are  somber and very important to disscuss ,but my space here is limited. I  would like anyone with interest in this subjests to contact me for further  discussion. And please read it, it's an experience that is hard to forget.	2000-08-02
