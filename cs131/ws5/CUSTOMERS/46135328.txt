As a lifelong U2 fan, I would of course buy it because Bono illustrated it, but that alone doesn't being to cover how cool this. \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" is a great children's story to begin with. Add in some great and very interesting illustrations done by Bono, Gavin Friday reading the story, as well as assembling a great arrangement for the music and you have a sure-fire, can't miss edition.  <br />The edition is well packaged and would make a great gift. It comes in a box, which includes the CD and book. The music is amazing. Different instruments are used that you normally wouldn't find and I found myself wishing that this had been around when I was a kid. Then maybe I would have enjoyed it more! As it is, it makes me smile. Bono's illustrations are extremely unique. They are deceptively plain and simple. I personally wouldn't expect anything less from him. Although, a warning, there are a couple of illustrations that may be slightly questionable for children. The real star with this is Gavin Friday, most famous, (perhaps unfortunately for such a talented guy) for being Bono's friend. Friday's voice is perfect for this telling. He has a unique voice in his music and he has applied it here. I could listen to it over and over again. The CD also has an enhanced feature with a behind-scenes documentary and gallery for PCs. <br />If you paid attention to nothing else, this is the bottom line. \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" extremely good all around, and it is even for a good cause, benefiting the Irish Hospice program. Can't beat that!	2003-11-15

Okay, I am not an expert on ancient history, nor do I read much from Sumerian times. Having said that, I did have to read &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; for a history class, and while it is a very good story (fellow students-you won't be bored), Ferry's translation is not the way to go. First, it is written in poetry form. Unless that is something you are looking for, I just believe it makes the story unclear. Secondly, and let me remind you I am not a scholar; the lines did not flow well. Ferry's interpretation also seemed to deviate from other editions I have read. 3 stars, because if you know what you are looking for, this translation is not without merit. <br />And one final thought, I liked the Penguin Classics translation by N.K. Sanders. It was clearly written, in a story form. Plus, there is a lot of background information, historical facts and footnotes to guide the reader.	2003-08-19

His family knew it, but still, his sudden death came as a shock to them. When \\"Our Father Who Art in a Tree\\" opens, he has been dead for several months and the family has just begun to recover from his passing. Until one day when Simon hears her father's voice calling from the gum tree in the backyard. She climbs up, and her father tells her he is sorry to have left everyone behind. Simone's still grief-stricken mother notices her young daughter in the tree and calls the fire department. She punishes her daughter until she will explain why she is in the tree. <br />The tree, inhabited by her father's spirit, becomes a way to communicate with the dead. It sets everyone back in the grieving and threatens to tear apart any normalcy in the family's life. \\"Our Father Who Art in a Tree\\" is an interesting look at loss and recovery in a family when someone dies too young. It is a quick and poignant read that is good for everyone, but I would recommend it especially to someone who is a period of mourning. <br />Overall, Judy Pascoe has done a great job taking us into a heart of a mourning family, told through young Simone's eyes. The cast of characters is sometimes funny, and sometimes able to bring their sorrow into your own heart. Four stars to a well-done first effort!	2003-05-01

While I am not a big fan of short stories, I had to have &quot;Irish Girls About Town&quot;. Maeve Binchy and Marian Keyes are two of my favorite authors and what can I say? I couldn't resist. These short stories are full of fun, life, and adventure in which any woman (not just the Irish!) can relate. &quot;Irish Girls About Town&quot; covers a wide range of topics, from PMS, to the simple joys of friendship, finding the perfect someone, heartbreak, and so much more.<br />Surprisingly, my favorite stories did not come from my favorite authors. Annie Sparrow's &quot;The Unlovable Woman&quot; had me laughing and rolling my eyes as at a woman who can't see the love of her life directly in front of her. &quot;Moving&quot; by Collette Caddle is another personal favorite. Out of 16 stories, only two seemed lacking. Julie Parson's &quot;My Cup Runneth Over&quot; was a bit darker and tried to pack too much into too small a space. &quot;Your Place or Mine&quot; suffered from the same. Other then that, this is a wonderful book. If you are fans of Binchy, Kelly, or Keyes; do not pass it up. I didn't and because of that, I have discovered some wonderful writers and got some wonderful stories in the process!	2003-02-09

Max Berry has joined, in my opinion, Orwell and Huxley in a new startling could be true story. This is a world where taxes are outlawed. The United States controls most of the world. France is the only hold out in a corporation-dominated world. Your job is your identity. The police are nothing more then a paid service that will do anything for the right price. Call 911 only if you are affiliated with the right companies-not to mention, rich. <br />At the heart of this story is an ex-advertising executive, Jennifer Government. Because of her past, she finds herself in the center of a war between Government, the NRA and big corporations. Joining her are a strange and eclectic group of characters, whom you will love to love and love to hate. Max Berry has a wonderful writing style coupled with an extreme (or maybe not so extreme) imagination. A great and fun read for anyone. Especially those of use who are sick of hearing advertisements run amuck.	2003-02-05

While I was not entirely disappointed, I would probably not look into any of her other novels. Rachel Beckett has been falsely imprisoned for the murder of her husband. She was sentenced to life, but after twelve years, she is released on a strict probation. She is not even permitted to see her daughter. After years of prison, Rachel has learned a thing or two about committing real crimes and she is determined to seek revenge on her husband's real murderer.<br />I found the basic plot of \\"Eager to Please\\" okay. It was fast paced, with a couple of good characters, including the main character of Rachel. However, it was slow to start, with what I felt was far too much background information. Another complaint I have is there seem to be several stories mixed in. I found that the more I read, the more confused I became. And the main plot had no real twists. Overall, I would say it is a basic mystery of sorts, and there are a great many authors out there who can do so much better. Skip this one.	2003-01-09

I have &quot;been owned&quot; by cats for as long as I can remember. Currently, I am sharing my house with three of them. All of them have very distinct personalities and enjoy different things. I would love nothing more then to spend a year of my life observing them and all their little quirks. That is what Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson has done in &quot;The Nine Emotional Lives of Cats&quot;. I am not familiar with his other works, but as a cat lover, I just couldn't resist this book.<br />Basically, I would say this is just what I expected. The author noting the behaviors of his five cats. I was a little disappointed about the small world he lives in but applies to anyone who owns a cat. Not all of us are fortunate enough to live in New Zealand, in a quiet neighborhood that is safe to let cats roam free. And I reject the idea that cats cannot be happy unless they are allowed to roam free. Masson's words almost made feel like I was giving my cats a miserable life. <br />However, there are very good points. He has pointed out traits that I recognize in my own cats that never fail to make me smile. He gives great historical facts on the domestication of cats, and in doing so, explains why they can never become truly domesticated. I would say this, despite its flaws, is a good read for anyone being owned by a cat, or anyone who loves them in general.	2002-12-31

I knew nothing beyond the basics of apartheid in South Africa until I read Harry Bloom's incredibly powerful book. Even now, I cannot claim that this book has made me an expert, far from it, in fact. But, I have a much greater appreciation of what like was like in the Transvaal (or black locations) in South Africa. Even though the title is a work of fiction, I believe that the reader will get a much greater understanding on this topic. (And like other reviewers, I admit I picked this up because it is written by Orlando Bloom's father.I will use any excuse to pick up a new and different book! )<br />Bloom's story is set in the fictional town of Nelstroom, S. Africa. We are introduced to two main characters, Du Toit, the location manager and Mabaso; a black man who has come from Johannesburg with the hopes of easing the hardships of life in the location. Du Toit begins his job with the best of intentions, trying to make life better while still enforcing the laws of apartheid. He will eventually, of course, give in to the higher ups. Mabaso is an educated man. He makes the people of the location aware of how they suffer. And we all know education is a powerful thing. The people who stand behind these two men will clash and begin to rebel against each other. This is a book you know will not have a happy ending from the first page.<br />Since I can't find the words from my own experiences to describe the total unfairness and confusion of apartheid, I would like to take a quote from the book, which stuck with me from the point I read it until I finished and long after that. \\"Facts are twisted, illusions fostered, truth destroyed to prove that the perverted is normal, the sordid noble, the brutal beautiful, the guilty innocent, the coward a hero, disaster a victory-and the reverse of all these things.\\"(Pgs 277-278). Harry Bloom was imprisoned for writing this book, that alone is testament to its truth. Despite its heavy subject, it is a great, fast paced read. And a book that will stick with you for a lifetime.	2002-12-02

Oney Judge was born on George Washington's famous home, Mt. Vernon. She had grown up there, she loved it there. On the surface, she led a good life. She was a personal favorite to the General and Lady Washington. She was treated like one of the family. Only problem was, Oney was a slave. \\"Taking Liberty\\" tells the story of Oney's childhood on Mt. Vernon and her loyalty to the family that loved her. But above all, it tells of her quest for the most basic human right, to be free.<br />I have often credited my love for history to Ann Rinaldi. Her books are always educational, historically accurate and above all, fun. \\"Taking Liberty\\" is her latest book, carrying on her wonderful style. Once again, I have found myself completely drawn in. Anyone, of any age, who enjoys a good story doesn't want to miss this.	2002-10-28

It is then up to Ethan Feld and his group of friends to save the \\"Summerland\\", (through baseball) and all who inhabit it.<br />I have put off writing a review for Michael Chabon's \\"Summerland\\" since finishing it a couple of weeks ago. The writing and characters have stuck in my mind, which really says something for Chabon. But, as far as the story goes, I am really not sure where I stand. While it is being promoted as a children's book, I agree with many of the reviewers that it is perhaps too ambitious for a child. At 500 pages, it took me some time to get through. As for adults, it seems that too much as been taken from other fantasy works, such as \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\", as well as drawing from folk lore and mythology. It just didn't seem to contain much originality. That is the only way I see this being sold as a children's book, assuming they haven't read much else. However, \\"Summerland\\" still has its moments. Chabon has a way with words and characters that make you want to continue on. Next time, I hope he can deliver something more in league with \\"Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\\".	2002-10-25

I always have an admiration for those who write autobiographies. It seems you are opening yourself up, letting everyone see who you are, learn about your mistakes, but best of all, allow people to see you are human. Michael J. Fox has done an extraordinary job with &quot;Lucky Man&quot;. He begins the book by telling of his childhood in Canada, all leading up to his career. He talks then about his insecurities as an actor and a person. If Michael J. Fox has an ego, he leaves it checked at the door. From then, he talks about his diagnosis with Parkinson's.  From his feelings that this was his punishment for not being the person he thought he should have been, through denial, anger and finally acceptance, Fox tells the world, that while he is not perfect, he is indeed lucky.<br />I found this book to be inspiring for anyone. It shows that things in life can either change you for the better or completely take over, but ultimately, the choice is yours. Throughout, I laughed, cried and above all, I hoped. For anyone who has ever been diagnosed with Parkinson's, for anyone, anywhere, Fox can teach us all a major lesson in life. And it is even for a good cause. I would give this book my highest recommendation.	2002-04-09

They seem to be a hit or miss and &quot;Fortune's Rocks&quot; is a definite hit. In my opinion it is her best book to date. In the summer of 1899, Olympia Biddeford is summering with her parents in Fortune's Rocks, New Hampshire. At 15, she is just beginning to feel like a women who is becoming what she will one day be. John Haskell is a 41 year old married man. When he first lays eyes on Olympia, he knows, without knowing why, that there is something special about her. They begin a passionate affair that they know can only lead to heartbreak. This is a book about a true, but forbidden love and all it's consequences. <br />While the thought of a 15 year old and a 41 year old is a bit unsettling, you can't help but hope for the best between these two. Shreve has developed two wonderful and unforgettable characters that will at times break your heart. If you have ever enjoyed Shreve's books, then there is no question you will absolutely love this one.	2002-03-19

I had never read a book by Olivia Goldsmith before and if her others are like \\"Bad Bay\\", I doubt I ever will. Okay, so like other reviewers pointed out, there are a few editing errors. I can forgive that. However, a books that is focused on the lives of two main characters that you can't stand creates a problem. Tracie is a newspaper journalist who is perpetually attracted to bad boys who will use her and loose her. All the while, she is telling her self and the world that when Phil calls her stupid, he means that he loves her. UGH!!! Jon is a successful computer geek. Or any women's dream. For seven years, he has listened to all Tracie's heartbreaks and can remember ever detail. Only problem, he can't get even get a date. So, he appeals to Tracie for help. She successfully transforms him into a jerk. When she realizes what she has done and of course, that Jon is who SHE really wants, will it be too late?<br />Like I said, the characters in \\"Bad Boy\\" were just annoying. However, I will say that a decent plot line keeps this books going. I wanted to finish it, at least. It also served it's purpose of being a light, quick read.Maybe not so totally terrible.	2002-03-14

I came across this book in a search for something like Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series or Sara Donati's \\"Into the Wilderness\\". While not quite the same standard of the other two authors, Kathleen Givens does not disappoint. English lady Mary Lowell is stuck in something of a mundane existence. She is being courted by a man whose intentions are unclear. Her friends are getting married, while she is being passed back and forth between relatives. One night, at one ball, she meets Alex MacGannon, Earl and laird of Kilgannon. In a time when feelings between Scotland and England are unsettled, at best, these two people ignore their heritages and fall in love. Questions of mysterious attacks, sinking ships, and jealous family members threaten the new found relationship. But through it all, love will triumph.<br />Givens has done a good job with \\"Kilgannon\\". I found a lighter version of Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\", but a little more strictly romance. The characters are a little weaker, but all in all, this is a good story. So, if you are an \\"Outlander\\" fan like myself, waiting impatiently for the next installment, give this on a try.	2002-02-20

I don't know how to describe this book, unless to say it describes Earnhardt Jr. I didn't realize what a talent he had for writing and I am glad he opened his life up, in his owns words. Not really a biography, &quot;Driver #8&quot; follows Jr. throughout his first year in Winston Cup. He talks about how he felt during a particular race, how it feels to deal with the media, and just in general what it is like in his day to day life. <br />I know, like any race fan, that Earhardt Jr. has a real talent for racing. This book proves that his talents reach far beyond the racetrack (not that I ever though otherwise), as well. Opening himself up and sometimes showing a different side, this book gave me a real idea of how he feels. This is a must own for any Jr. fan, or maybe just anyone who enjoys a little something different.

Let me say, first off, I think Caroline Kennedy has done an excellent job in putting &quot;Best Loved Poems&quot; together. I had never seen such a wonderful, eclectic collection in one volume. There is a poem for every mood, or any adventure. Plus, the love Caroline had for her mother shines throughout each page. The added addition of Jackie O's own poems makes this a must own. <br />There are few poetry books that I have felt I needed to own. I find it tiring to read the same poet over and over again. Or, just read poems related to one subject. But, this one is different. I couldn't pass it up and I suggest you don't, either.	2002-01-10

As a recent fan of Nora Robert's, I am always so glad when things like &quot;A Little Magic&quot; are published. Comprised of three shorter stories; taking place in Ireland and surrounded by magic, this is one collection no Robert's fan will want to miss. In the first story, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, Calin and Bryna have waited years and lifetimes to find each other. Now, they have met, but is there love strong enough to fight off a powerful enemy? In the second, &quot;Ever After&quot;, Conal lives in self-imposed loneliness, denying everything about himself. Until one day when magic leads flighty Allena to his life. And finally, &quot;In Dreams&quot; tells of a magician put under a 500-year spell that only love can break.<br />If you want to find out what the fates of the people in these magical tales are, you will have to read the book. In addition to getting good stories, it teaches that true love is the only real magic. My only complaint? I am wishing each story was longer.	2002-01-10

Set on a ship sailing from England to Australia in the 1800's, Sarah is traveling in the unmarried women's section (in steerage) of the ship. With a tough matron to watch over them and nothing better to do, each girl tells a story of what they are running from and hoping to find. At the heart is Sarah, who believes she has a fish in her stomach and is made of salt water. She tells her story in broken bits, as part of the journey causes her to remember.<br />I am really not sure what to think of this book. Sometimes, I think it is good, others, it seemed very poorly done. Christine Balint is more known for her short story work, and in my opinion probably should have stuck to it. &quot;Salt Letters&quot; is a good story, with vivid descriptions that pull you in and make you feel what is going on. But, the Balint has goes from each characters story, and back to Sarah's, the main character. The ending, well, it just ends, leaving you wondering what happened.	2002-01-08

I give her credit for my love of history. I continue to read her books, because I know I will get a good story and &quot;Staircase&quot; is no exception. Lizzy Enders is on her way West with her family and their charge, Elinora. When Lizzy's mother dies, life, as she has known it, is over. Elinora is to be taken to a Catholic convent school where her uncle is Bishop. Lizzy expects to leave with her father, but is left behind. There, she learns some hard lessons in life and how to take the good with the bad, with a little help from friends.<br />Rinaldi, in her classic style has taken an event in history and built a wonderful, captivating story around it. No matter how old I get, as long as she keeps writing, I will be reading. I highly suggest you do the same. If you are have never read her books before, this is a great place to start.	2002-01-06

I recently picked up &quot;Outlander&quot;, the first book in the series, of course. It totally had me hooked. I read that one in only a couple of days and finished the next three in a matter of weeks. And like many other reviewers here, I thought that this was a little lacking in comparison. When the book is actually focused on Jamie and Claire, it is great. The characters we love are still there, and still up to their adventures. But, I agree that entirely too much time is spent on Bree, Roger, and Jemmy. Bree is in mommy mode most of the time, unless it's when she is it know it all mode. Roger is made out to be a big baby who can't do anything for himself. Jem, face it, is a baby and doesn't do anything, but we are still informed of it.<br />I know it sounds like nothing but complaints, but it is still a good book. Now all together, for once, on Fraser's Ridge, life for the Fraser family goes on and it's a story no loyal reader wants to miss.	2001-12-30

I love to read historical fiction, mainly, but every now and again, I will pick up something else. I was given &quot;Love Stories of World War II&quot; as a gift and I am by no means disappointed. In a time when the world was at war and death and dying was a harsh reality, some people were falling in love. Larry King has done an excellent job of putting this book together, keeping with facts and mementos of the couples in the book. Rather then sweeting it up, their stories are told with excerpts from letters and the histories behind the love. It is not mushy stuff, just simple stories of love in a time of war. <br />I am very pleased with this book and I would recommend it to any history fan. It reminds me of the love my grandparents share, having a similar story to some of those told in the book. And it leaves me with a strong sense of love and devotion.	2001-12-27

Friedman has chosen in interesting topic (the penis) and has managed to collect some fascinating history on it. However, the way the book reads is very poor.

I was first a fan of Sara Donati's &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot; series. Anytime I mentioned them to someone who had read the &quot;Outlander&quot; series told me that I would love these that much more. But being my stubborn self, I refused to believe anything could be better. <br />Well, needless to say, I was wrong. Gabaldon is quite the storyteller and I found myself completely absorbed for two days. Jamie Fraser is a man any women would want to love, with the greatest mix of innocence, courage, and strength. Claire (who I am slightly jealous of) is of the same mix, but for different reasons. Truly a great heroine. Aside from powerful characters, Galbaldon has done her research well, giving great facts on 18th century Scotland and only making the book more vivid. If the rest of the &quot;Outlander&quot; series is as good, I am definitely in for a treat.	2001-11-12

Christmas won't be the same this year for the Krank family. With their daughter Blair gone with the Peace Corp, it just seems pointless. So Luther and Nora decide to skip Christmas, just for one year. No parties, not presents, and not a single Christmas card will be sent out. Instead, a cruise to the Caribbean is on the plans. In &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, Grisham once again leaves his main genre and takes us through the Krank's life leading up to not celebrating Christmas. But when the unexpected happens, the Kranks are forced to celebrate Christmas and learn some things in the process.<br />From diets, to some-what nosey and concerned neighbors, this is a delightful, fun book.  I gave it four stars because I felt it could have more substance. It reads like a quick paced time line, with little detail and doesn't take but a day to get through.  But don't let that fool you, it is a charming little book that I'm sure will be around for Christmases to come. Good job Grisham!	2001-11-10

If you refuse to go, death is the punishment. <br />&quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot; is quite possibly the most original book I have ever read. Mark Dunn's first novel is highly creative, insiteful, with a touch of political undercurrents. Written in the form of letter correspondences, it is a quick and entertaining read. As letters become outlawed, they do in fact drop from the book, not making it harder to read (as was my worry) but only adding to its charm. &quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot; will even give you a new appreciation for that wonderful thing we call the alphabet, as well as put a smile on your face. So, find out the fate of the alphabet and the citizens of Nollop and read this book!	2001-11-09

It covers a wide range of topics, like how to deal with bad dates, all the way to how to tell if your date is an axe murderer (something we all need to know). For the sometime downright hilarious to the lighter-hearted side of dating, this is a great book to own.	2001-11-08

I thought &quot;Gap Creek&quot; had a lot of good points, as well as a lot of bad ones. First, I have to compliment Morgan's style of writing. He truly has a gift for making words in a story flow. However, I thought parts of &quot;Gap Creek&quot; was more or less a typical story of early Appalachia. When Julie is a teenager, she makes Hank, who is only a teenager himself. They marry young and move from the only town both of them has ever known. There, they learn that life isn't always peachy and sometimes the people who work hard don't always finish first.<br />As I said, the story is fairly typical, but the characters and writing style are not. Julie is a hard worker and very honest. I found myself hoping with each turn of the page things would work out. Hank is more mysterious to the reader, as he is to Julie, which only adds to his character. Even though some of this story is mundane, it still will keep you turning pages.	2001-09-25

But this book proved me wrong and also managed to put aside any concerns that I would have in doing so. First, this book makes the adult &quot;wanna-be&quot; ballerina realize that it in not a pipe dream to dance ballet. It answers almost every concern anyone could come up with and encourages you every step of the way. From what to wear to class, where to take class and what to expect once you've started. In addition to that, it defines those sometimes mystifying French terms used in dance, as well as showing you how to do them. One other great thing is a directory of schools that offer adult classes. But what I liked best is that this book gives no illusions. It doesn't promise that you will be dancing point for the New York City Ballet or that your technique will be perfect. It's honest, which is what makes it the most helpful. If you ever thought of dancing ballet but think &quot;yeah right&quot;, read this book. It can only help.	2001-08-19

The diary of Alice shows a very real world of what can happen when tangled with drugs. It shows how your life, relationships, and everything else you care about can fall apart. Being a true story, it shows that what you hear about drugs are not made up. On top of all that, it is an enjoyable read, sometimes painfully hard to read through. &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; is definitely the best book of it's kind.	2001-06-29

Like probably everyone who has ever read GWTW, I dreamed about how things would turn out between Scarlett and Rhett. But this book makes a joke out of anyone's imagination. Ripley has all but sabotaged the original characters. Scarlett has been transformed into a simpering &quot;little&quot; woman, as opposed to the strong-headed heroine she was in GWTW. Rhett is no longer a rogue, but just some average, boring, southern gentleman. Not sticking to any characteristics of the Mitchell's original creations, this book is bound to disappoint you.	2001-06-29

I thought how could Steve Martin be any different from any other actor/comedian trying to write books, but I picked it up one day and was not disapointed by it. Shopgirl is sometimes a dark comedy that leaves you wondering if you should be laughing or crying. The characters are well-devoloped and coutinue to change and grow throughout the story, leaving readers wondering what will happen next. My only complaint-should've been longer.	2001-06-28

This books gives you the places to do just that. It is packed full of info on places that are all within two hours of DC. Most of them are unknown to te majority of the public and make the perfect places to get away. Anyway, this book is also pakced with info on difficulty of hikes, when the best times to take then and any number of interesting tidbits. This book is a must for those who live in the Washington DC area.	2001-06-28

I was a little disapointed to discover that the book is written as if the author wanted you to do some of the things she talks about. It does have some good points to it. It gives ideas on how to raise self-esteem and self image, but other then that, it is fairly shallow. So, if you are like me and just looking for something a little humorous, this one is too on the serious side.	2001-06-28
US	46135328	R3LEJMBDNXJ3ZK	0525945652	613318936	Jimmy's Girl	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Little to Recomend	I bought this book because of it's supposed similiarity to an author I like. I was very disapointed. The plot line is weak, something you could find in any number of other books. It's poorly written to boot and is not very believable. Two people that are both happily married begin to wonder about the what might have beens. And of course, they have to go off and find out. To predictable and slow moving.	2001-06-28

I think many people have jumped the gun on this book, thinking it is a sequel or something of that nature to Gone with the Wind. And it definatly isn't that. I have to say that this book is something that should've been written. I will give the author credit for that insite. It also has some good entertainment value. It is humourous at times and give good perspective on lives on the other side of the original story. I gave it only three stars because, first, some of the details in this book do not go along with GWTW. Secondly, as a warning, if you haven't read GWTW, it will not make much sense. All in all, it really is a good read.	2001-06-26

I bought this book thinking it would have good info on tracks, drivers and what not. If that is what you are looking for, At Speed is not that book. Dutton has spent time on each driver at a certain race. He gives no information about them, just a comment here or there. Nothing new about the tracks. Magazines can tell you more about individual tracks. I didn't notice much about the fans in NASCAR, either. Dutton clearly couldn't have spent much time on that anyway, judging from the rest of the book.	2001-06-26

I have to admit, this book caught my attention because of the cover, but now I have come to love it. The recipes are very simple to make, and they taste great. To top all that off, it is a health food cookbook, but with most of the recipes, you would never be able to tell. If you are looking for a cookbook, this is definatly the one to have!!!	2001-06-26

Linda Hogan tells a beautiful story of pain, love, life and healing. Literally, weaving her life story together, a story that anyone can relate to comes to the surface. This book is not just &quot;another biography&quot; told so that people can sympathize and feel sorry for the author. Instead, it is one of those rare books that pulls you into the authors' life and teaches you something about yourself. <br />Sometimes detached from herself, Hogan lets you into her life, her pain and makes you realize that pain and hurt is not always what breaks you, but is what makes you stronger. A fine, beautiful book and a definate must read.	2001-06-25

We all use to kid around that someone who wrote so many books had to be following a format and couldn't be any good. But this book changed my opinion and has hooked me on her books. A friend had a copy on a long flight and with lack of nothing better to do, I picked it up. The story of the three Mercy sisters mixed with a murderer was unlike any author I had ever read. And I was hooked. There was no putting this book (or her others) down after that. So, for all you skeptics or just someone looking for a great read-I highly recommend this.	2001-06-22

Nuala O'Faolain takes us into 50 year old Kathleen's life and her search for love, knowledge, and forgivness. By interweaving two different faiths in two different times, O'Faolain takes readers on a captivation journey and sometimes causes you to pause and take a look at your own life.	2001-05-04

I have never read anything so beautifully written. Parts of this book are so tragic and heartfelt that it pulls you from your surroundings and take you to another time. Birdsong takes a hard look at life in WWI, but also interweaves tales of different lives and different times for a powerful combination. This is a must read book.	2001-04-16

Although it is tragic, Jennifer Lauck really captures the memories of her childhood. A warning to readers-this is an incredibly sad story that is told through the eyes of the child living it. Young Jennifer never realizes what is happening and because of that, this book can and will cause you to cry.	2001-03-05

However, if you aren't a fan of Brodie's work, this one probably isn't for you. For the most part, Halliday has just re-printed information that has been published many times over. He does look at some issues, such as Jefferson's relationship with Maria Cosway, in a new light. But I found many parts of the book to be poorly worded and sometimes very low in judgement. This would be a great book for someone who has never read much on Jefferson, but if you have, there isn't a lot of new insite Halliday adds to the great man's life.	2001-03-01

This book takes you into a dark underworld that you can't possibly imagine. It challenges what you have already been told and dares you to think or question anything. I would definatly recommend this to anyone who wants to be dragged into a strange world of sex, drugs and love.	2001-02-08

A wonderfully written story of how one innocent, hopeful child can change the world.
