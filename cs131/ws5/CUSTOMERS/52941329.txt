If you familiar with the 18th variation only, you  should treat yourself to listening to all the variations played back to  back in the &quot;Rhapsody.&quot;<br />This book has those variations which  have been reduced by Rachmaninoff for two pianos/four hands.  I wish, of  course, it had been a piano solo, because I would probably get a lot more  use out of it.<br />&quot;Rhapsody&quot; is strictly for the advanced pianist.   This edition has no fingering notations which would have been helpful for  all except the most advanced players.  And, those players may find  Rachmaninoff's &quot;Rhapsody&quot; not as challenging or rewarding because  of the repetition involved in its themes.  However, I find  &quot;Rhapsody&quot; very rewarding to play largely due to its romantic  themes and its capacity for expressive interpretations.  The 18th variation  played by itself is an enjoyable recital piece.  I give this book my  highest recommendation.	2000-07-29

In the other  songbook from &quot;Titanic&quot; that was released is a piece entitled  &quot;Rose.&quot;  That is very similar to &quot;The Portrait&quot; except  that &quot;Rose&quot; is a lot more powerful and compelling.  &quot;The  Portrait&quot; requires a softer touch that what I prefer in piano  music.<br />The other pieces were not as enjoyable as the first  &quot;Titanic&quot; songbook (which, by the way, is the best book of  soundtrack music, and it can easily be found by searching for its ISBN:  0793592240).  A lot of the pieces in this second book are based on songs  rather than the score.<br />Contents: AN IRISH PARTY IN THIRD CLASS *  ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND * THE PORTRAIT * JACK DAWSON'S LUCK * A BUILDING  PANIC * NEARER MY GOD TO THEE * COME JOSEPHINE, IN MY FLYING MACHINE * A  SHORE NEVER REACHED * MY HEART WILL GO ON (LOVE THEME FROM TITANIC) *  EPILOGUE * THE DEEP AND TIMELESS SEA<br />The &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;  song is also in the first &quot;Titanic&quot; songbook.  That is a  piano/vocal/guitar piece, and I did not find it as enjoyable on the piano  as the score music.  The rest of the pieces are piano solos (with vocal  music included for &quot;Come Josephine&quot;).  One big plus in my mind  for the book is that the publishers did not waste money on full-color  inserts from the movie.<br />I recommend the other &quot;Titanic&quot;  songbook first, and then this only to those who really like the music from  the movie.	2000-07-29

Each piece is masterfully arranged as a piano solo.  The book itself contains seven piano pieces from the &quot;Titanic&quot;  soundtrack plus the &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; song.<br />The contents  are as follows: Never An Absolution * Southampton * Rose * &quot;Take Her  to Sea, Mr. Murdoch&quot; * &quot;Hard to Starboard&quot; * Unable to Stay,  Unwilling to Leave * Hymn to the Sea * My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme from  &quot;Titanic&quot;).<br />My personal favorite is &quot;Rose.&quot;  It is an  arrangement for the piano based on the theme song.  It is one of the most  beautiful piano pieces I have played on the piano, and it is perfect for  the beginning to intermediate player.  &quot;Never an Absolution&quot; and  &quot;Hymn to the Sea&quot; are also very nice on the piano.  I liked all  the other pieces from the soundtrack.  Some of them are definitely for  intermediate level players, such as &quot;Take Her to Sea, Mr.  Murdoch&quot; and &quot;Hard to Starboard.&quot;  The &quot;My Heart Will  Go On&quot; song is the one selection that is for piano/vocal/guitar.  It  does not sound as well on the piano compared to the other pieces,  especially &quot;Rose.&quot;  But, I'm sure its inclusion will be a plus  especially for those who like the song.  I personally liked the other songs  which were specifically geared for the piano.  They simply could not have  been arranged better.  I wish other movie soundtracks would release piano  books of this caliber.  I give this book my highest recommendation.	2000-07-22

I thought that the number of pieces by him in the book was worth the price.  However, I found that this  book has crammed so many pieces in here that clarity is sacrificed too  much.  Many of the pieces are even more difficult to read than they already  are.  And, the worst part is that some of the pieces do not have fingering  guides.  An example of this is &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.&quot;  There  are a few number guides for fingering scattered here and there, but none of  them are essential.  Now, if I remember my history correctly, Liszt wanted  his pieces to be so difficult to play that only he really knew the best way  to finger them (it goes something like that; believe me, I'm not that much  of an expert on Liszt).  I have a version of &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No.  2&quot; elsewhere that has fingering to just about every note by Rafael  Joseffy (and was published by G. Shirmer in 1902 originally).  So I'm not  sure if his fingering notations are themselves copyrighted (which would  explain why they are not included in this book), but they are essential for  playing the piece.  &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot; is itself what I  consider to be one of the hardest piano pieces in the world to play.  I  myself have worked on it for well over 10 years (off an on).  I can't  imagine playing it without fingering notations.<br />I would only recommend  this book for advanced piano players.  And even for advanced players, I  would recommend skipping &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot; as presented  here because it will likely lead to frustration (unless you're a flat-out  genius).<br />[This book includes: By the Lake of Wallenstadt, Consolation  No.'s 1-5, Dance of the Gnomes, Erl King, Etude No. 11, Etude in E,  Farewell, Funeral Procession of Gondolas No.'s 1-2, Hungarian Rhapsody  No.'s 2 and 6, La Regatta Venetiana, Liebestraum No.'s 1-3,Mephisto Waltz,  Nocturne in B, Nuages Gris, Valse Melancolique, Valse Oubliee No. 1, and  Waldesrauschen]	2000-07-22

Schaum Piano Course)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Essential for learning how to play by ear	My piano teacher in high school gave me this book to improve my skills in playing by ear.  It helped me immensely and I cannot stress how essential this book is for the novice piano player in developing her or her  potential.<br />I have to admit that when I first saw this book, I thought it  was not for me.  It contains waltz and fox trot versions of traditional  songs (like &quot;The Irish Jubilee&quot; and &quot;Aura Lee&quot;), and  playing these songs was not reason I took up the piano.  However, in  practicing with these pieces, I greatly improved not only my ability to  play by ear but my piano-playing skills in general.  I learned all the  chords and how to incorporate them into what I'm playing now as well as how  to throw in all sorts of variations.<br />Even though there are four  &quot;Pop&quot; Piano Course books available, the first one stands on its  own.  Even if a person never looks at the other three, they will still  benefit greatly from this first book.<br />Contained in this book are 29  pieces, style variation guides, and chord directories.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2000-07-21

I enjoyed the songs on it that I recognized previously: &quot;Ordinary World,  &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; and &quot;A Whole New World&quot; (in that  order).<br />The arrangements are okay.  I believe I've heard several better  arrangements of &quot;A Whole New World&quot; before.  I did like the  &quot;Ordinary World&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; arrangements  particularly for the bass style that was used.  I actually haven't seen  better arrangements for Duran Duran and Madonna songs in books like this  before (hence the four-star rating).  Typically, the chords are repetitive  and unimaginative.  But in these versions the bass complements the melody  very well (especially on the piano, which I like) and isn't  overbearing.<br />However, with the other songs, the arrangements are average.   I would only recommend this book only for those who like some of the  specific songs in the book (see a listing below).  For those just wanting  to beef up their collection of sheet music, I'd recommend taking a look at  other books first.<br />Song list includes the following listed by title and  performer(s):<br />&quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; -- Madonna<br />&quot;Don't Walk  Away&quot; -- Jade<br />&quot;Feels Like Heaven&quot; -- Peter Cetera (duet  with Chaka Khan)<br />&quot;I Love You Period&quot; -- Dan Baird<br />&quot;If I  Ever Fall In Love&quot; -- Shai<br />&quot;In the Still Of The Nite&quot; --  Boys II Men<br />&quot;No Ordinary Love&quot; -- Sade<br />&quot;Ordinary  World&quot; -- Duran Duran<br />&quot;Walk On The Ocean&quot;  -- Toad The Wet  Sprocket<br />&quot;A Whole New World&quot; -- Peabo Bryson &amp; Regina Belle	2000-07-20

The contents are as follows: &quot;Journey To The Island,&quot; &quot;Theme From 'Jurassic Park',&quot; &quot;My Friend, The Brachiosaurus,&quot; &quot;Remembering  Petticoat Lane,&quot; &quot;A Tree For My Bed,&quot; and &quot;Welcome To  Jurassic Park.&quot;<br />Three pieces use the music from the main theme:  &quot;Journey To The Island,&quot; &quot;Theme From 'Jurassic Park',&quot;  and &quot;Welcome To Jurassic Park.&quot;  Incidentally, I found these  three to be the most rewarding to play on the piano.  &quot;Journey To the  Island&quot; is my personal favorite and is magical to play.<br />I give this  book four stars because I know it could have been much better.  There's  only 32 pages here, and of those pages only 25 of those are sheet music.   The front of the book has photos from the movie which are superfluous.  I  have no idea why publishers put movie photos in soundtrack music books.  I  think people who buy such books are probably familiar enough already with  the movie.  The extra space could have been used for more music pieces  instead.  On the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; soundtrack, 16 tracks are  included.  This book only has 6 of those in sheet music form, and generally  speaking those 6 are the more mellow of the songs.  I think it would have  been interesting to include some action pieces like &quot;The Raptor  Attack.&quot;<br />The pieces are at least intermediate in the level of  difficulty, but they are very rewarding to play on the piano (I will give  the publisher some kudos for releasing this as a piano solo edition).  I  highly recommend this book for piano players who like the &quot;Jurassic  Park&quot; theme music.	2000-07-20

For those who truly enjoy the &quot;Star Wars&quot; music and have a desire to play it, this book is  worth having.  I specifically bought the book for piano playing, so I wish  it would have been formatted in a piano solo edition.  Despite this, most  of the pieces play very well on the piano.<br />The first section contains  pieces from &quot;Star Wars: A New Hope.&quot;  These are as follows:  &quot;Star Wars (Main Theme),&quot; &quot;Cantina Band,&quot; &quot;Ben's  Death/TIE Fighter Attack,&quot; &quot;Princess Leia's Theme,&quot; and  &quot;The Throne Room.&quot;  Of those probably the main theme is the  easiest to play, but I still enjoyed it.  &quot;The Throne Room&quot;  sounds very majestic on the piano, and I'm glad it was included.<br />The  second section is from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and includes:  &quot;Han Solo and the Princess,&quot; &quot;The Imperial March,&quot;  &quot;Yoda's Theme,&quot; and &quot;May the Force be With You.&quot;  The  &quot;Han Solo and the Princess&quot; theme can be reasonably grasped by a  novice player, and it sounds very nice on the piano.  The same can be said  for &quot;Yoda's Theme.&quot;<br />The third section is from &quot;Return of  the Jedi&quot; and includes: &quot;Luke and Leia,&quot; &quot;Parade of the  Ewoks,&quot; &quot;The Emperor Arrives,&quot; &quot;Victory  Celebration,&quot; and &quot;Jedi Rocks.&quot;  Of those I particularly  liked &quot;The Emperor Arrives&quot; and &quot;Victory  Celebration.&quot;<br />This book has 60 pages of music plus a few pages of  photos and a fold-out poster.  I could have done without the pictures and  poster if it meant having a couple of more songs in there for the same  price (I hope the publishers read this).  But their inclusion was not  excessive (as I have seen with other movie music books).<br />I enjoyed this  book very much.  Of course, these piecesare not nearly as memorable on the  piano as were the original soundtracks, but for piano-playing &quot;Star  Wars&quot; enthusiasts, the book is worth buying.	2000-07-19

It has all the television show themes through &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as well as  the movie themes through &quot;Star Trek: First Contact.&quot;   Incidentally, those two pieces are my favorites.  The &quot;First  Contact&quot; theme in particular sounds very nice on the piano, and I have  played it numerous times.<br />I am very pleased that this was offered as a  piano solo edition.  Many contemporary themes/song books are typically  inundated with repetitive chords.  But I think the arrangements in this  book are very enjoyable to play.<br />The proficiency required to play the  pieces is probably best described as intermediate.  However,  beginners/novices may find the &quot;Deep Space Nine,&quot;  &quot;Voyager,&quot; and &quot;First Contact&quot; themes within their  grasp (and worth playing as well; I personally dislike &quot;big note&quot;  or &quot;easy piano&quot; editions of anything).<br />I guess it's pretty much  a foregone conclusion that if those who like playing the piano and like  &quot;Star Trek&quot; will enjoy this book.  So if you fit that category, I  highly recommend this book.	2000-07-19

But the author, Erik Joseph, does at least provide an overview of what to expect when entering a screenplay contest.<br />The first part of the  book describes structuring.  I was skeptical about this section in  particular since I've seen some great screenwriting books devoted to this.   And, the author doesn't really go much into structure but scratch the  surface, relying on quotes to guide the novice screenwriter.<br />But Mr.  Joseph does at least cover what the screenwriting contests consider  standard formatting for screenplays.  So I'd say his advice on formatting  was effective and helpful.<br />As for the screenwriting contests themselves,  Mr. Joseph provides a one page overview of 42 screenwriting competitions.   This section could definitely have been condensed.  I think about every  screenwriting journal out there lists these contests frequently in their  respective publications (&quot;Creative Screenwriting,&quot; by the way, is  my personal favorite of those publications).<br />Further along in the book  are a few interviews.  I always like interviews in screenwriting books, and  I will sometimes buy a screenwriting book just for the interviews.   However, these are very short and terse and could have been more effective  (I guess not everyone can interview like Barbara Walters, so I'll cut the  author SOME slack).<br />An excellent chapter (only two pages though) is  entitled &quot;Good Examples of Bad Screenwriting.&quot;  It contains  actual samples of bad writing in submitted entries.  Examining those  atrocities was very helpful.  However, I thought the author could have  expanded on these a little more or explained why he chose specific ones for  inclusion (are these frequent mistakes?  how can one best avoid them?  what  are good sources for further refinement of grammar?)<br />Overall, I will give  &quot;How to Enter Screenplay Contests &amp; Win!&quot; four stars because  it is effective in its discussion of screenwriting contests.  However, I  would have liked more advice and a longer book (it's 170 pages; but a lot  of the pages are partially blank).  And the cover of the book was not up to  par due to the advertising blurbs on it that were entirely superfluous  (&quot;over $3 million in guaranteed cash!&quot; on the front cover; and  &quot;win millions of dollars with your movie idea!&quot; on the back  cover).<br />In short, I'd like to see a second edition of this book that is  expanded upon.  However, I do think the product as it stands now is  effective in accurately describing screenwriting contests and motivating  aspiring writers to enter them.	2000-07-17

There's nothing in this book you do not  learn in pilot school.  If you're looking for supplemental information, I  would suggest &quot;The Art and Science of Flying Helicopters.&quot;  That  is a book I would consider supplemental because it offers a different  perspective on aerodynamics and maneuvers.

I bought this to help me complete my Master's thesis on the  recommendation of a few people.<br />I credit this book with helping me  prioritize things when it came time for the actual writing of the  paper.<br />The 15 minutes a day title is a little bit deceptive, however.   The program does not necessarily amount to 15 minutes per day strictly.   And, that can be unrealistic anyway.  I had actually tried a regimen like  that before.  But, while it can work for awhile, it can be very difficult  to maintain depending on one's work schedule or environment.<br />The biggest  help in the book for me (and why I rate it somewhat highly) is that it  helped me establish a workable scheudule with my professor.  I ended  offering some suggestions to my professor as to how often we discussed the  paper, etc., and it worked out nicely for both of us.  I think when it  comes down to it, you can examine the information in this book but tailor  it to what your professor expects.<br />I can say that Bolker's book helped me  in eventually turning in my Master's thesis.  But, keep in mind that 98% of  thesis work (particularly while having a demanding work schedule) is going  to be one's own determination and commitment.  And, this book is not going  to provide that for you!	2000-07-13

A quote from the preface by the  author is as follows:<br />&quot;It is hoped that this book will be useful for  the older engineer who has become familiar with discrete transistors and  who is now faced with the problem of becoming familiar with integrated  circuit technology and the world of microelectronics; also to the younger  technologist who wishes to know more about these topics.&quot;<br />This book  of course also requires a solid understanding of chemistry and calculus.

The publisher, Princeton Review, should consider hiring  people with at least Master's degrees in the future.  &quot;Math Smart  II&quot; is marginally acceptable as a learning tool.<br />I did find that it  was more helpful in studying for the GRE math section than the Princeton  Review's &quot;Cracking the GRE CAT.&quot;  That's because with that book  (and some other GRE books), the idea is to teach you the best strategy for  answering the questions rather than making sure you understand all the  concepts behind the answers.  So in that aspect, &quot;Math Smart II&quot;  can be of help for GRE test takers.	2000-07-12

To read the original story, &quot;Traumnovelle,&quot; is an enthralling experience.  To think that it was written in 1926 adds to its mystique.  The screenplay was worth looking  at, though at times I felt it was more of a transcription than a  screenplay.  The narrative follows the final movie cut's directing  instructions too closely, though there are some very minor deviations.  I'd  rather read the original script rather than a shooting script.  The short  story differs from the movie greatly.  It a captivating read, and I can see  why Stanley Kubrick spent most of his life wanting to see it on the screen.   I think reading the short story gave me an appreciation of what Mr.  Kubrick added to it to make it a remarkable film.  The structure from the  original story is vastly improved in that there is a confrontation of what  the main character witnessed.  In the short story, it is left up in the air  as to the true nature of what he saw, with the strongest suggestion being  that it was harmless debauchery of aristocrats.  One aspect of the short  story that was not explored (and thankfully so) in the movie was the main  character's obsessive longings after extremely young women (including the  young daughter of the rental costume owner).  You'll have to see  &quot;American Beauty&quot; for those scenes.	1999-11-21

While I can't say I agree with everything in this book's approach, I can say that it helped me put &quot;pen to paper&quot; when I was &quot;stuck&quot; otherwise.<br />There are a couple of weak points to the book.  One is that King should have advised that the writers know something about supporting characters before starting to write the actual screenplay.  Another is that she advocates a set pattern of writing when in reality such a formulaic method will not apply to all people.<br />But, I still highly recommend this book as it was extremely helpful to me.  I would just add a cautionary note to modify her method of writing to fit your own.  Once you do that, you will become more prolific in your writing.	1999-06-13

But, the &quot;GRE Hit Parade&quot; in the back of the book falls short of expectations.  Most of the book contains vocabulary words each with a brief  definition and a couple of sentences showing uses.  But, many words on the  GRE Hit Parade are not expanded upon.  The GRE Hit Parade itself is merely  a terse listing of definitions.  Therefore, those studying for the GRE are  much better off with a GRE review book rather than purchasing this one.The  one good thing about the GRE Hit Parade was the advice to build 10 words a  day.  I used this technique and found it helpful.  But more detailed  explanations of these words with example sentences was needed.The  publisher, The Princeton Review, has another book out: &quot;Cracking the  GRE&quot; which also has a GRE Hit Parade.  It is a slightly more concise  listing, but it is about as useful.  Vocabulary lists are only  supplementary to regularly learning vocabulary words from readings anyway.	1998-11-21

It's ambitious &quot;genius&quot; title is a bit deceiving, however.  The words are not  really that advanced.  The script is corny as with other tapes in the  series.  But it kept me entertained enough to listen to the tapes and  perhaps work in a word here and there into my mainstream vocabulary set.I  recommend this to those who want to improve their vocabulary and are  pressed for time.  But don't be surprised by the juvenile approach of the  two narrators.  Some of the wisecracks they make are offensive.  There are  several examples of sexual innuendoes.  Also, there are some anti-Greek  fraternity statements in the Word Smart  series that I took offense to,  having been in a fraternity in college.  It seems like there wasn't a good  editing job and that the scriptwriter pushes his negative views of certain  societal aspects, like fraternities and relationships between men and  women, and exerts them on the listeners.I'll give it three stars instead of  one simply because I probably was able to learn from it despite serious  deficiencies in the presentation of this set.	1998-11-18

Here they present the elements they feel are important in screenplays.  The fact that the authors do not expound on their opinions is a welcome aspect of their book.  They mainly use parts of screenplays to make their points.  The section containing a few interviews (Ernest Lehman, Robert Evans, Delbert Mann, Frank Rosenfelt, Michael Zimring, and Gene Wilder) is useful.  Another section that contains excerpts from screenplays and treatmen	1997-10-03
