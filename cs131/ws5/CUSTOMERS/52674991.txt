This is one of the books that I have used the most and recommend to every single person that takes a class at my school - it has a section that  lists the most important food products and the ingredients they match with - useful for creating recipes and menus that have sense. I would recommend it also for anyone that loves to cook at home but with advanced knowledge of culinary techniques.	2005-09-27

Halfway through the book I felt sick - Rebecca Bloomswood - the Shopaholic, is an air-headed obsessive- compulsive that can't do anything right, except - shop. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down - I actually enjoyed it because it is funny and in some way, educational - but I think Kinsella could have done a better job in the last pages - because I found the ending to be abrupt and lacking of details - leaves you wanting to get the next book in the series - Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, to see what Rebecca's next adventure is like. <br /> <br />This is an entertaining read and definately not food for the brain.	2005-09-27

I had a good reference, his books are full of spectacular photographs and good recipes. <br /> <br />What I like most about this Hors D'Oeuvres cookbook is that the recipes are original, plus every recipe has a picture. I haven't seen most of the recipes here in other books. The recipes are elaborate, most of them containing various elements but they are very well explained and beautifully presented. I would say an ideal book for a caterer looking for new ideas, or any person that loves entertaining.   <br /> <br />Plus the author is a professional Chef that has written succesful books on cooking techniques so I would definately recommend this one.	2005-09-23

It is a hard to find book and one day I found it on the Amazon Marketplace and ordered it.  <br /> <br />The book is all about Antipasti, and it starts with a chapter about the history of Antipasti illustrated with beautiful pictures of old portraits and of an italian market. The next two chapters are about Types of Antipasti and the Antipasto Pantry, where the author carefully explains the different ingredients utilized in this kind of foods. <br /> <br />The recipes are organized in Finger Food, Fork Food, and Preserves and Basics - in this cookbook you will find many recipes for Bruschetta, Crostini, Tartine, Bocconcini (little bites), Grissini (breadsticks), Foccace, Torte, Frittate (italian omelettes), carpaccio, salads, antipasti with fish, chicken, cheese, vegetables, and marinated foods. <br /> <br />I love this book. Every chapter has an introduction where she explains about the dishes, their names, and their history. It contains beautiful photos both ancient and modern. I recommend \\"Antipasti\\" to anyone that collects cookbooks and to anyone that loves real Italian Food.	2005-09-16

The best thing about \\"Secrets of Colombian Cooking\\" is the fact that it is written by a native Colombian.  Patricia McCausland -Gallo is originally from Barranquilla, a city on the northern coast of Colombia. She traveled extensively throughout the country researching for the best recipes for this book. Secrets of Colombian Cooking is a magnificent and very complete collection of the best dishes of Colombian cuisine. <br /> <br />I am lucky because Patricia now lives in Panama and I was able to attend a cooking class that showcased recipes from this book. In this class the author prepared 5 dishes: \\"Arroz con Coco y Pasas Titot\\" - this is a rice prepared with coconut milk and raisins - the coconut milk is left to reduce in a cast iron pot - until only the coconut oil is left and it begins to stick to the sides of the pot and change to a brownish color - this is Titot - add the raisins and let them sit for a few minutes until they begin to puff - add rice and fry it in the Titot and then cook the usual way - the result is an ultra delicious rice dish fragant with coconut and with the sweetness of raisins added. <br /> <br />Chef McCausland also prepared a very famous little bread in Colombia called \\"Pandebonos\\" - they are very similar to Popovers but these are prepared with yuca flour and cheese - a very easy and quick recipe made in only a few minutes. One of the other typical Colombian dishes prepared were the \\"Patacones Pisaos\\" - giant ultra crispy green plantains fried and served with just a little salt sprinkled on top.  <br /> <br />But, the one recipe that blew our minds and left every single person in that class crazy for Patricia Mc Causland's Colombian cooking, was the \\"Cazuela de Mariscos al Coco\\" or \\"Crustacean Chowder\\" on page 90 of the book. This is the most delicious seafood soup I have ever tasted and the best part is that it is super simple to make and with ingredients very easy to find - seafood, you can use shrimp, clams, squid, mussels, or yourfavorite combination of seafood - you can even use the frozen mixed seafood in the 1 pound bags found in the supermarket - the recipe calls for fresh Coconut Milk, but you can substitute for the unsweetened canned one found in the store - other ingredients called for are saffron, to give the orangy color of the soup , cilantro, white wine, and parsley.  This dish is -  without exaggeration - amazingly delicious, I personally think that if you want a single reason to get this book, it would be this one spectacular recipe! <br /> <br />Other traditional recipes found in this book are \\"Ajiaco Bogotano\\" - the famous Chicken and Potato Soup typical of Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, \\"Empanaditas Vallunas\\" - little Beef and Pork Turnovers made with yellow corn and stuffed with a filling made with beef and pork cooked with onions, garlic, potatoes, and spices. \\"Arepas con Huevo\\" or Egg Filled Arepas - this dish particularly called my attention - is an arepa partially cooked, then cut open to stuff with an egg, closed again with more masa, then cooked until the egg is done.  \\"Bandeja Paisa\\" - is a typical dish from the region of Antioquia - made with beans, meat, pork rinds,fried eggs, chorizos, rice, plantains and sauce. On the sweet side, \\"Arequipe\\" - or the equivalent for Colombian Dulce de Leche - \\"Arroz con Leche\\" or Rice Pudding, \\"Flan de Coco\\" or Coconut Pudding are some of the desserts that you can find in the book. <br /> <br />These are the TRUE secrets of Colombian Cooking - and no one can write a book about a native food better than a native Chef.  <br />The recipes are simple to follow, and the results are outstanding.  <br /> <br />If it is authentic typical Colombian recipes, in other words, the \\"real thing\\", that you are looking for, then I highly recommend \\"Secrets of Colombian Cooking\\".  <br />	2005-05-30

Ruth Reichl is funny in this memoir about her times as the New York Times restaurant critic. One of the rules of all serious restaurant critics is to go anonymous, so Ruth describes in her book not only the desguises she wore but the personalities she created for the different characters she became: Brenda, Emily, and even her own mother. Ruth transformed herself not only physically but mentally, sometimes confusing her own self. At the end of the book she discovers she needs to move on, and go back to the kitchen instead of the dining room. Great read, I personally loved this book.	2005-05-03

I recently made some of the recipes for a class: Dominoes and Polka Dots (the almond biscuit is outstanding!). This is one of the few miniature cookbooks I have found and a must for all pastry lovers.	2002-12-19

Rowling has become my heroine. Her imagination awes me, there is absolutely no way you can put this book down after having read the first few pages. It is so well written that I was transported into the magical world of Hogwarts. I already started reading the second book, and can't wait to get back to Harry Potter. As a mother of a one year old, I am keeping all 4 books ( and others to come), for my son to read in the future.	2001-12-05
