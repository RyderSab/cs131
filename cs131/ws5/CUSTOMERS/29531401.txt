While it wasn't the greatest book in the world, it was interesting enough to keep me attached for a few hours. It's about a former pageant queen who develops this metabolic disease that makes her gain weight. Her character seemed more of an anti-heroine, as she is pretty negative to those around her, whether they be fat or thin, is constantly putting her 'old image' on a pedestal while not coming to grips with herself, and whines almost constantly. It got a little tiring. She kind of began accepting things toward the end, but not entirely, and I was mildly satisfied with her decision concerning a friend. I was hoping there'd be more, frankly, but I guess the author leaving the end to us to imagine was what made the book better. Did she wind up losing the weight or did she stay fat? Don't know. It's up to you to figure out. <br /> <br />Would I recommend it? Maybe to some people, but some of the things the character did to herself don't exactly set a positive role model for girls struggling with their weight to look at.	2005-08-17

I reread this morbid tale one night as I tried to fall asleep. At first it entertained me. But having parted ways with these stories for years, I realized that it was the same spark that got people to read books like Mommie Dearest or Flowers in the Attic. People love to be shocked. And this is a book with nothing but horrible things befalling our 'beautiful' heroine with no bright light ahead of her. It seems that all of the good guys in VCA books are beautiful and most of the bad guys are ugly. And did I mention the rape scenes were absolutely disgusting?  <br /> <br />I rest my case...	2005-08-07

This book royally stunk worse than the garbage juice collecting at the bottom of a week old bag containing rotted garbage. To make this short, it was simply V.C. Andrews copied with boring, if not idiotic characters, and cheesy, awful dialogue. My dad's toe cheese could produce better work than this! At least it was given to me as a gift, so I at least didn't waste money on it. The only downside, though, is that it's still wasting space on my shelf. But I'm not so cruel as to give it to another poor victim... <br /> <br />Avoid... <br /> <br />Read Flannery O' Connor, Chuch Palahnuik, or Charlotte Bronte instead - at least they have real characters with grit!

All right, I got around to reading this thing, so I might as well put my two cents in here. People who say \\"It's for children!\\" or \\"He's a teenager; cut him some slack!\\" Ahh, no - if your book is published, you shouldn't be granted amnesty from bad reviews. Everybody's entitled to his or her opinion, and my opinion is that Paolini didn't mean this to be a children's book, if there was mention of rape in the book. While it isn't the worst book ever written (some of those spewed out by Publish America are pretty wretched), it certainly is far from becoming a classic like, say, Jules Verne or Robert Lewis Stephenson. Filled with cliches and unnecessary description, along with avoidance (for the most part) of the word 'said', this book was way too predictable and lumbering for me. It was padded out at over 500 pages when it should have been about 250 pages at the most. The author should have waited a few years before publishing this monstrosity. I'll bet ten years from now he'll look back on this and shudder.	2005-06-09

I'm not going to summarize it as so many others have, as that would just be too darn repetitive, so I'll go right away to my opinion about the book. First of all, I liked Andrew's character, though I didn't particularly like the descriptions of him doing work around the house. That was just boring. The flashbacks, on the other hand, were not boring. Shreve did a great job at characterizing the main characters of the novel (I keep thinking of Eden as a boy's name, mainly because Jesse Metcalfe has it for his middle name, so that took a lot of trying to get over, but that's a story for another day), though there were a few stereotypes sprinkled here and there. However, the description of housework and cleaning didn't add to the story, nor did some of the events, like some of the conversations, really add: in other words, the book could have been shorter instead of padded out like it is. And another thing was the climax. She just mentioned the villian about to do something, skipped the big explosion completely, then went right to Andrew and TJ hanging out at (I won't say where for those who don't want it spoiled). Sure, the climax was described, but I wanted to see it and feel it rather than it being told to me.  <br /> <br />It wasn't great, it wasn't awful. It was just something to pass the time while I waited for sleep to come.	2005-05-22

Granted, Amelia was fifteen when she wrote this, it isn't too bad of a book, being the grammar's right and there aren't any spelling errors or anachronisms, like you'd find in a VC Andrews book. But the characters weren't developed and it seemed as though she told too much rather than showed. Also, there were way too many adverbs. As Stephen King said, \\"The adverb is not your friend.\\" But besides that, she did decent. She told the story and got it published. Would I recommend it? No. Read her later works, which are actually quite good. Hawksong surprised me. I dislike her early works, but Hawksong is a good novel and definitely worthy of publication. And to Chelsea K. Palmer - get over yourself. If you are so good of a writer, then why aren't you putting those 'talents' to use? You obviously aren't that good if you can't finish a dang story!     With that said, read the book if you want to. But I suggest not. Stick with her latest works.    Cheers!	2005-03-01

For her to ruin the literary market. What is it with these publishing giants these days putting out this crap? What happened to literary value and art? It's all about the money these days, as we can all plainly see, from the cruddy stuff being churned out. It, IMO, is especially offensive to struggling artists. As someone majoring in creative writing and minoring in theater, it saddens me to see that the industry is going downhill by putting out this garbage. And no, I'm not jealous of Paris. From what I see, she is a very ignorant, shallow young lady who gets by in life on flirting and being cute. And no matter what she does (i.e. calling those black boys that disgusting n-word that shouldn't even exist), she is forgiven for it, all because she is beautiful and rich, whereas if someone like, say, Al Franken or J.K. Rowling did it, they would lose fan base fast (unless, of course, they used plastic surgery to turn into Ken and Barbie dolls). Unfortunately, though, this is American culture of the twenty-first century, where people like Paris and William Hung are our sources of entertainment.

Okay, if you do the math, this book should take place in roughly the '70's or so. Here's a little lession for everybody. Before you sit down to write a novel that takes place years and years ago, you do research. If you don't do research, your characters might be listening to Backstreet Boys cds in Ancient Rome or watching Survivor while traveling on the Oregon Trail. When that happens, it is called an ANACHRONISM. Thus, having Grace listen to Shania Twain in the '70's is an ANACHRONISM! Therefore, that makes for a sloppy book that shows the author does not care one whit about it. <br /> <br />Why does the Andrews family keep this guy on? He stinks. Anachronisms galore, shoddy writing, characters nobody cares about or likes, and cliched plots - in short, a book that never even should have made it past the slushpile. But hey, if it had been Joe Writer writing this, it never would have made it past the slushpile.

Andrews's old books today and came to a disgusting realization. One I never thought I'd reach. After having weened myself off these books and moved onto Alice Walker, Dorothy Allison, and the like, I came to the realization that these books really, really suck. Except for Dark Angel and the books prior to that, the writing is flat and lifeless, the characters have no voices of their own (they all sound alike!), and it's just repetitive. The stories are all the same with different settings and names. You have the beautiful, but naive narrator, the handsome prince, the bad uncle/cousin/brother, the evil sister, the evil grandmother, the self-absorbed mother, the weak father, and the catty girls who are jealous of the narrator. Throw in a bible-thumper, too, while you're at it! Granted, Celeste doesn't have all the cut-outs, it still isn't good material.

At first, school for him is total hell - from coke getting sprayed into his locker to a group of jocks mooning him in the hall. His only friend is the odd and homely Binky, a girl with no friends herself. But then he meets Charlie Good, a very popular, charismatic boy who drags Paul out of the world of nerdiness and into the world of the popular. Paul is mesmerized by Charlie and is so needy for love and acceptance that he will do whatever it takes...even if it means planting a bomb in the school. <br /> <br />Overall, this was a very good book. There were a few disturbing scenes in the book and I wish Paul had more balls to stand up to Charlie and realize that Binky was a true friend, but Alex Flinn's amazing, funny writing style more than makes up for it. She is an excellent writer and I loved her book, Breathing Underwater, which takes us into the mind of an abuser - quite a delicious twist, if you ask me. She is good at creating anti-heroes that we can relate to in one way or another.  <br /> <br />I look forward to her next endeavor.

This was one of those books that made me mad, cry, and laugh, but, also, extremely disturbed to the point of having to put the book down for a moment to take a breath and remind myself it's only a novel.

And not only is Precious pregnant, but she can't read or write, so she is sent to Blue Rain's class to learn. In this novel, as Precious learns to write down her feelings, we find out the painful past of this beautiful, intelligent, and sensitive character - from her mother's cruelty to her father raping her. And we grow with her, laugh with her, cry with her as she struggles to become someone and to take care of her new little boy, Abdul. <br /> <br />This is a novel I definitely recommend reading.

Atwater-Rhodes has proved that she has grown as a writer and is moving on from the whiny vampires in the other books. And for this, I applaud her. The characters also seemed gutsier and more interesting in this novel than the previous ones. And, thankfully, Danica wasn't the obnoxious, lonely tough girl being chased by some wimp. Zane was an engaging, even believable character. And the relationship between these two was a bit more believable than those of the others in her other books. Two young people wanting to bring peace to the land, end the war, even if it means going to desperate measures.  <br /> <br />Will I buy the sequel? Probably.

It explores such things as the horrific beatings in 1927, the discrimination, and even includes a few photographs. Definitely a must-read for research on this topic. Even if it's soley on the Alabamian Klansmen, it will still inform you well.	2004-04-21

Trite, slow-moving, cliched, this book is just like the other V.C. Andrews book, only it is by far one of the most poorly-written published works of &quot;art&quot; I'd ever come across. Obviously, if V.C. Andrews's ghostwriter hadn't penned it and it had been some other schmuck, it never would have gotten published, much less touched an editor's desk.<br />In a nutshell, this book is just like all the other V.C. Andrews books. There's plenty of rape, a bad boy with a fiery temper who feels the need to protect his lover/relative, an incarceration ala FITA or Gabrielle Landry, and a bunch of cliched metaphors and similes that will make any reader cringe. And was it just me or was Summer not worthy of a narrator where this book was concerned. Seemed to me this book should have been told by Harley. It was more about him than her anyway. <br />Once again, if you can't sleep at night, pick up this book as a knockout pill. Otherwise, be smart and avoid it. <br />Cheers!	2004-04-21

All history buffs have heard of Meyer Lansky, Al Capone, and Bugsy Siegel, but few have heard of Paul Volpe, the boss of the Toronto Mafia from the early-1960's up to his death in 1983. I picked up this book, intrigued by the fact that it was someone different and, especially, someone from another country. The book detailed the Canadian mob while weaving in the biography of Volpe - his bootlegging days as a young man, to his initiation into the Mob, his stints in jail, and then the details of his death. If you are a history buff who enjoys reading about the Mafia and are interested in learning more about Mafia bosses from other countries, then this is definitely a book you'll want to check out. The only problem is that it's rare and you might have a difficult time finding copies.	2004-04-21

Why take four godawful mini books and make them into one, horrendous novel? I suspect it's about the money. If you want to waste your money, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, if you want to be smart and save, don't bother. As Simon Cowell would say - this is absolutely dreadful.	2004-04-21

Elie Wiesel's All Rivers Run to the Sea gave us a more in-depth look to the concentration camp survivor. He really gives us a rich experience in weaving together the threads of his past, from his days in school to the horror in the concentration camps, right up to his days of being a journalist, and ending with him as a groom. You really get a feel for the type of person he is as well - a wonderful, compassionate, and intelligent man. If you've read Night already, you're definitely going to want to check this out.	2004-04-19

In fact, it was so bad that I had to wash my hands a few times and then brush my teeth to get rid of the bad taste it left in my mouth. It was the stereotypical rags-to-riches story with a girl who has big dreams but is so poor she feels she can't ever meet them, when, lo and behold, her dreams come true. This is like a bad, childishly-written version of a VC Andrews novel. It's something that never should have been published, yet somehow was lucky enough to make it past the editor. And we all know why. It's because Britney wrote it. Had it been some average schmo, this book would have never even seen the printing press. Just goes to show what the priorities are in this day of age, but we know it doesn't matter to Britney - as far as I'm concerned, she's smiling smugly at the vast amounts of money being raked in from this little endeavor.<br />In a nutshell, just avoid this book. You'll be so happy you did. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it and instead just read it while at the bookstore. Trust me. If you need a real good dramatic book, check out Dorothy Allison, Alice Walker, or VC Andrews's old books - you'll be so happy you did. <br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS!	2004-02-11

And I was pleased with this little number after having to wait for it to arrive in the bookstore for a week, and let me tell you, the wait was worth it. This book tells the story of Avocet Abigail &quot;Bird&quot; Jackson and her dirt poor family in Florida. Rich with description and sweet with good prose, this book is one that will sit in the readers' minds long after they've finished it. Everyone else did a pretty good job at describing the plot, so I don't think I really need to do that. All I can do is suggest anybody who enjoys dramatic, well-written novels to pick up this book as soon as possible. The money you'll spend will be worth it	2004-01-30
US	29531401	R24CTXEL4RTYLE	0803727453	50365062	Mississippi Trial, 1955	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Racism...	I just finished this book tonight and I will say it is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The protagonist, Hiram, doesn't exactly get along with his father, especially where his grandfather is concerned. So when his father finally permits him to go to Greenwood, he is thrilled. But the town isn't how he remembers it to be. It is all perfectly clear when his 'friend' R.C. forces Emmett Till, a black youth from Chicago visiting his uncle, to eat fish guts. When Emmett whistles at a white woman, things go sour, and R.C. talks about wanting to go with a few men who invited him to teach Emmett a lesson. But then Emmett goes missing and when his body is found, Hiram has a feeling R.C. might be one of the men involved with the boy's brutal murder. Though two of the men, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, involved are on trial, it isn't known who the other two (a man and a woman) are. Will justice come to the Till family? And who else was involved in the murder of Emmett Till? <br />This book was excellent - the characterization, the setting, description, plot...it was a well-written, well-thought-out book. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for a good book on prejudice and the Civil Rights movement. It will really get you thinking.	2003-12-12

It's about a young girl named Ruth Anne (Bone for short) who lives with her hardworking and weighted down by sadness mother, Anney in South Carolina in the 1950's. Anney falls for this guy, Glen, thinking that he's the 'right man' who'll take care of her and her two daughters. At first, Glen's a pretty good guy, despite the fact that he has trouble keeping a job and bringing in a decent income, but then he grows meaner over time, jealous of the relationship Bone has with her mother. And, during the climax, the relationship between the girl and her mother is tested with the brutality of Glen.<br />This was an excellent book, possibly one of the best books I've read. I practically read the whole thing in one sitting, it was that hard to put down. The characters were so well-developed, it felt as if I'd met them on the streets somewhere along my life. From the shoplifting incident at Woolworth's to the brutal beatings inflicted upon Bone, you really felt as if you were there, viewing the scenes as they unfolded. You will laugh, cry, grow angry as you read this book. I recommend it to anybody.	2003-09-17

It really taught me a bit, despite how short it was. Wiesel is a wonderful man who has since dedicated his life to humanitarian issues and making sure that we don't forget this tragic part of our history.	2003-06-24
US	29531401	R2TTUMHY33JDT7	0671039970	490860880	Broken Wings	Books	1	2	5	N	N	Really, really bad...	What can I say about such a book except that it was really, really bad? Abysmal. Personally, if it were up to me, I would have put a stop to this 'dragging VC's name through the mud' a long time ago. She was a wonderful writer when she was alive, and this ghostwriter should just quit writing. They should just put her name to rest before it gets any worse.<br />What's the book about? It's just about a bunch of whiny girls who are born to be bad. I'm through Teal's story now, and I'm struggling to drag myself through Phoebe's, it's that boring. Teal was just a whiny brat, Robin...well, I hate to say this, but her sarcasm wasn't witty one bit, nothing like Melinda Sordino from Speak or Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye. She came off as just bratty. I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst books I've read in a long time, and I read a lot. <br />I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. You'd get more from staring at the wall twiddling your thumbs than you would from reading this book.	2003-06-24
