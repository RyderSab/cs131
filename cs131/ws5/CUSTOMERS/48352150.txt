It is similar to Christine Feehan's Dark series - only MUCH better!  The author took all the good elements from Feehan's series and pulled the together into a well-written novel with character development.   <br />The vampire world created by Sizemore is fascinating.  I wish there was more about the vampire world in the book - that is my only criticism.  I loved the heroine and hero.  The heroine is strong and doesn't need the hero to rescue her (my favorite kind of heroine).  The hero is an Alpha male, but he does listen to and respect the heroine. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this one if you like vampire romance!  <br /> <br />	2004-08-18

The first is The Legend of Banzai Macguire followed by Days of Fire (both are great reads). Overall, the series is awesome and should not be missed by any fan of sci fi romance!  <br /> <br />The futuristic world created by Maverick is fascinating. Australie has reverted to a penal colony and is isolated off from the rest of the world. Drug-addicted thugs acting like ancient British nobility rule the continent.  The other prisoners must survive under their corrupt rule.  The background is so interesting, I wish the story could have been longer to learn even more about it. <br /> <br />Jenny Red, the heroine of the story, is a strong heroine, both physically and mentally. I appreciated the fact that the can take care of herself, and did not need the hero to rescue her. Deck, the hero, is not as developed as the heroine - my only complaint about the story.  It is not always easy to understand his actions or motivations. <br /> <br />What I loved about this story is the conflict between the two characters.  Jenny loves Deck but thinks that he betrayed her.  The internal conflict within Jenny about Deck, and the drama, as the story plays out, is rich and fascinating.  A very refreshing read from the typical sci fi romance of psychic healers and starship captains. <br /> <br />Great characters, great background, great story - what else do can you ask for in a book?  <br /> <br />Don't miss this book or this series!  <br />	2004-08-18

The first is The Legend of Banzai Macguire (also a great read).  Overall, the series is awesome and should not be missed by any fan of sci fi romance! <br /> <br />The futuristic world created by Nance is fascinating.  Canada is the victim of modern plagues and has been quarantined off from the rest of the world.  Nance does an excellent job describing what life would be like under these conditions - I loved the whole concept of plague hunters.  I wish the story had been longer just to get more of a feel of this world.   <br /> <br />Day, the heroine of the story, is a futuristic mountie in Canada.  She is a strong heroine, both physically and mentally. I appreciated the fact that the can take care of herself, and did not need the hero to rescue her.  I also appreciated the fact that this is part of the reason why the hero falls in love with her. Lian, the hero, is a plague hunter.  He joins forces with Day, and the action begins!  <br /> <br />The character development was excellent in this fast-paced book.  And, there was alot of sizzle between Lian and Day.

Typical of her other stories, it is funny with a lovable, wacky heroine.  I adored the heroine Jeannie - it was refreshing to read from the perspective of an un-PC, rude, in-your-face herione.  I especially appreciated that the hero fell in love with her for the exact same reasons that I enjoyed reading about her.  A word of caution - I would not describe the story as hot (especially compared to Undercover), but it is a very enjoyable, light read. <br /> <br />\\"Instruction in Seduction\\" by Jamie Denton was a very heavy, inconsistent, and boring story filled with cliches.  Eden, the heroine, was neglected, abused, and told that she was a dud in bed (how familiar is this one?).  She manipulates Jackson, the hero, into providing her personal love lessons, but she has no interest in him otherwise.  Jackson secretly loves Eden, so he agrees to the lessons with the hope it will develop into something more.  Poor character development, predictable plot lines, and awkward writing prevent this story from developing any type of sizzle or tension.  Read Robin Schone's The Tutor if this storyline appeals to you, but don't bother with this one.  I give it 1 star. <br /> <br />\\"Wicked Ways\\" is hands-down one of the worst 'steamy' love stories I have ever read.  The plot is totally unbelievable. Peyton, the heroine, is a very modest, chaste member of the community who happens to own a lingerie factory in the middle of nowhere.  In order to bring in more business, she entertains some risque business clients.  She is forced to call the library hotline to receive advice on appropriate behaviour in bars, strip clubs, etc...  What person in their right mind would call the library hotline for that type of information?????  Due to the lack of a cohesive, believable plot, I rate it one star. <br /> <br />	2004-08-17

The secondary characters are fully developed interesting people also.  The author did an excellent job with building up [intimate moments] throughout the book.  The first [intimate moment] happens towards the beginning of the book, which usually means the rest of the book will be boring.  Not so in After The Ashes.

The second novel is not as good as the first, and, in no way, compares to the author's Texas series.  This is the story of Harry, sent to Texas from England to learn about life by his father.  Harry pursues Jessye, but only for sex.  Due to his upbringing he has no heart left to give.  One of my problems with this book is Harry's whining over his upbringing.  I never heard a man whine about the lack of love in his childhood, and I hope I never do - it is a real turn-off!<BR>There are plot twists and a lot of unbelievable coincidences throughout this book.  I don't want to give anything away, so I won't describe them.  My general complaint is that things became very unbelievable and really hurt the plot of the book.<BR>In summary, this is an enjoyable book, but it is not a keeper.	2004-03-24

The event to bring the lead characters together was a fake wedding.  The premise is the heroine is dying and her wish before she dies is to have a wedding ceremony.  WHO WANTS TO HAVE A FAKE WEDDING????  I could have believed that she would wish for a temporary marriage, a night of passion, a party held in her honor, etc...  But I cannot believe that anyone would want just a wedding ceremony as their dying wish.  The hero (who apparently works for the Make A Wish Foundation) grants her dying wish.  <BR>My second big problem with the book is the heroine's treatment of the hero.  She rejects him when she learns of his deep, dark secret.  The secret was nothing terrible, so it was difficult for me to believe that anyone would be horrified by it.  I think the hero deserved a lot better than the lame, sickly heroine.<BR>In summary, this book was not believable.  Most of it did not make sense to me.  I would pass on this one.	2004-03-24

Secrets abound in this book - who is pregnant?, who was pregnant?, who slept with whom?.  Too many secrets and a poorly developed plot ruined this book.  The secrets never seemed worth keeping, causing the whole premise of the book to crumble.  I also hate this author's trademark forced seductions.  Can't her heroines ever maturely realize that they would like to sleep with the hero.  The occassional forced seduction can be quite sexy (see The Well Pleasured Lady), but this author uses the template again and again in all her novels.  I did not enjoy this book and do not recommend it.	2004-03-17

The majority of the book describes the travels of the main characters.  During their journey they learn to overcome the hurdles of their past and fall in love.  It is a beautiful love story between two people who were never likely to fall in love.

It is definitely the weakest in the trio for a variety of reasons.  First, the heroine is what I classify as 'too dumb to live'.  She makes many bad decisions that put the hero at risk and require him to save her.  Second, there are several forced seductions that really didn't do it for me.  Finally, the heroine is such a shrew to the hero, I could never understand why he was in love to her.  The author needs to work on developing her characters and showing why the grow to love each other instead of focusing on action.  It would also help if she created more likeable characters.	2004-03-17

Unlikely coincidences and the heroine prevented this story from being better.  I found the frequency of sexual molestation to be too coincidental and not necessary for the poignancy the author was trying to achieve.  Further, the heroine was somewhat of a shrew.  When she turned away from Matt after his confession, I wanted him to leave her and find somebody worthy of his love.  The author was never able to justify the heroine's bad behaviour and redeem her.<BR>One item about the book that I really liked was that the hero was a virgin.  Overall, I applaud the author for dealing with a difficult topic (sexual molestation of children), but this book is definitely a grade C.	2004-03-17

I love the premise - forced marriages is one of my favorite plots.  However, the forced marriage in this book was in doubt in my mind.  I never saw the reason for it, which put this whole book on shaky ground for me.  I also did not like the hero in this book.  First, he unfairly blamed Louise for the marriage.  Second, he never did anything great or wonderful to make Louise fall in love with him.  Overall, he was rather boring and at times annoying.  I never found myself cheering for the main characters to stay together.  In the end I wish Louise had packed up her bags and found herself a real man.  Another reason I really disliked this book was the villification of Philadelphia.  She was a young woman who was wronged by the hero.  Instead of letting that story lead to some poignant moments and difficult decisions, the author villified her.  One bright note in the book is the main heroine Louise.  She was strong and smart, and she learns to value herself.  I always like books with strong heroines.  Overall the book is not bad, but it is not great either.	2004-03-17

It lacked the poignancy of the author's first novel in the series.  It also had a much weaker plot.  One of my problems with the book is the non-existent journey to love for the main characters.  Dodge simply loves Starla for no apparent reason.  I could never buy it since Starla was a total shrew to Dodge for much of the book.  I had a lot of problems with Dodge also.  He was so boring compared to Starla's brother.  Overall, the book was an enjoyable read, but not a keeper.	2004-03-17

I find it be unworthy of the praise received.  It is merely an average book for several reasons.  First, the reasons for the main characters forced marriage was unbelievable.  Second, the reason for Ellen's fear of men and being touched was unbelievable.  Third, the coincidence of multiple cases of sexual molestation was an awkward plot development that probably shouldn't have been included. Fourth, Ellen was a very annoying and unworthy heroine.  She didn't deserve Matt and was never able to redeem herself in my mind.  When she turned away from him after his confession, I wish Matt had left her.  Not a good thought for a hopeless romance addict.

In the hands of a more skilled author, this could have been an excellent book.  Unfortunately, the author ruined this book with 'secrets', forced seductions, and cliches.  First, Skylar's secret was really lame.  It was never believable that she didn't confess all as she grew to know Hawk.  Second, I like a forced seduction as much as the next romance reader, but the ones in here were really lame.  It was difficult to believe that there was any attraction between the characters at all.  Third, Skylar was a really dumb heroine.  Why can't this author create a heroine who can get herself out of trouble instead of relying on the hero to do it for her?  Just pass on this one.	2004-03-17

The hero was your typical rake with a tortured past.  You probably can figure out where the story goes from here.  One final note, the author has this annoying habit of sprinkling the phrase &quot;Um&quot; throughout her dialogue.  I advise a more judicious use of the phrase, because it became very annoying!

The author excels at writing really good sex scenes.  Other than that, there is not much else holding this book together.  Typical of this author, the hero has a horrendous past that makes him an emotional cripple.  I think you can see where the plot is going from that.  The heroine will rescue him and make him whole.  There is no journey to love in this book, the characters simply love each other.  The plot is more focused on action.  I enjoyed reading it, but will not read other books in the series, as the book lacked the emotional poignancy that I look for.  As a further note, the author has incredible imagination (as displayed in most of her works), but I wish she could get beyone portraying her heroes with terrible backgrounds.  She needs to use her imagination a bit more instead of recycling her old plots.	2004-03-15

This was the first romance novel I ever read.  I finished it and thought it was one of the worst books I ever read.  Then I promptly picked it up and read it again.  There is something about this book that appeals to me.  The book portrays a strong alpha male hopelessly in love with the heroine, which is probably a fantasy buried deep inside most women (hence the universal appeal of the book).  Anyways, the book is poorly written - some of the scenes are so awkward that I cringe.  The journey to love is non-existent.  However, the book does appeal to me in some way.	2004-03-15

It centers on one relationship, so it appealed to the romantic in me.  There was no group sex or partner changes.  Instead the focus is on two people falling in love and having great sex.  It is a short book, so don't expect a lot of emotional build-up.  Have I mentioned the hot sex?  Check this one out if you like your erotica with a little love and tenderness.	2004-03-15

I am always looking for a good vampire romance novels.  I was excited when I read the reviews for this one.  So excited that I bought all three books (...).  What a total waste of money.  All three books were poorly written.  The character development is non-existent.  The sex is not sexy or enticing.  There is no build-up in the relationships, everybody simply loves each other for no apparent reason.  The only thing going for this series is the author's imagination.  Don't waste your money on these books!	2004-03-15

After having finished it, I wondered if I read the same book as the other reviewers.  This book was awful.  The heroine is the typical virginal saint seen in the older romance novels - she is nice to all sorts of downtrodden invididuals and animals.  The hero is the cliched man with a tortured past.  The book is so poorly written that the very premise (man marries unsuitable woman to thumb his nose at his family)is not believable.  Read The Light In The Darkness by Ellen Fisher for a similar premise and a well written novel.	2004-03-15

I am definitely in the minority on this one, but I didn't find it particularly hot.  Most of the sex scenes just didn't do it for me.  While there were an abundance of them, they were not very graphic or enticing.  I also didn't find the book to be particularly well written.  Try Marly Chance for some really hot books.	2004-03-14

In addition to a lot of sex, it is a love story about two people.  The alien world and story created by the author is compelling enough to keep your interest between the sex scenes.  I highly recommend this story.	2004-03-14

As with the first installment of the series, this story is hot.  It has graphic love scenes.  The story and the alien world created by the author are compelling enough to keep my interest between the sex scenes. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for something really sexy.	2004-03-14
US	48352150	RQJZ12KBRYMXU	0380779625	452779165	Keegan's Lady	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Enjoyable Novel/Poor Character Development	This was an enjoyable novel that had the potential to be an excellent novel.  I would have given it a higher score if the author have focused more attention on developing the relationship between the lead characters rather than focus on the external plot.  Instead the characters simply fell in love with each other after being forced to marry.  Since the heroine was fairly awful to the hero, I never understood the reason for the love.  A romance novel should be a journey in which two people grow to love each other.  The external plot is important but should never overshadow the journey.  Instead it should be part of the journey.  This books focuses too much on the external plot.	2004-03-12

I generally like my heros a little dark and tortured, so I was looking forward to this book.  Unfortunately, the heroine totally ruined the story.  She was so saccharine sweet - she was utterly naive and always nice.  I am sure deers approached her and butterflies flitted around her head.  I would also classify her in the 'too stupid to live' category.  She was not a good match for the hero.  Don't waste your time with this one - read To Have and To Hold for a dark hero/forced relationship romance!	2004-03-12

It was a well-written and well-researched novel.  It was just not a compelling story for me.  I never got involved with the characters, and I never understood why the fell in love.  The development of the relationship between the characters was sacrificed for the plot of the book.  In the end the story was an OK read but not memorable to me. Plus, I never understood the attraction to the main character.  He was entirely devoid of humor and personality.	2004-03-10

This is the story of two very lonely people finding happiness and love together.  They are from different social classes and and much of the novel focuses on the implications of that difference.  Madeline Hunter is an excellent writer and able to bring the time period alive in her books.  She realistically portrays the relationship in medieval times.  Moira is a wonderful heroine unwilling to sacrifice her beliefs.  If you like medieval romances or poignant stories, I strongly recommend this book!	2004-03-10

They fall in love but cannot sacrifice their beliefs for that love.  I was very moved by the story.  Madeline Hunter is an excellent writer and able to make the time period come alive.  Nesta is her strongest medieval heroine.  She did an excellent job of making her independent in a believable manner.  If you love medieval romances or strong heroines, then I recommend this book!	2004-03-10

Ms. Hunter is, technically speaking, an excellent writer.  I don't always like her character development.  In this novel, I really dislike her heroine.  She was both immature and ungrateful.  I could see no reason for the hero to fall in love with her.  Her behavious ruined the story for me.  I am not able to recommend this book.	2004-03-10

The Black Plague was an intriguing background story.  Also, the author is an excellent writer and really suceeds in bringing out the time period.  Unfortunately, the hero of the story, Morovan, is a real jerk, and he never redeems himself.  The heros in Hunter's novels are generally dominating and without humor.  Morovan was extreme in both these character traits.  So much so, that I found myself wishing Anna would dump him.  This would have been a great medieval romance if Anna had an HEA with someone else.	2004-03-10

As the other reviews reflect, the romance is quite dark.  The hero is fairly awful in the beginning, but he does redeem himself in the end.  The story is about two very lonely, scarred people healing and finding love.  The author's character development is superb.  Her descriptions of the English are lush.  I can't say enough positive comments about this book.  If you don't mind your romance a little dark, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.	2004-03-09

The actions of the heroine were not believable.  For example, after being gang-raped by a group of outlaws, the heroine finds it in herself to make out with the hero (even though she doesn't know him).  Further credibility challenges come up surrounding the death of her children.  Finally, the hero and heroine fall in love without any apparent reason.  The author never shows the two falling in love, they merely do in the first couple of chapters of the book.  The rest of the story centers around violence, murder, and rape.  This is no romance.	2004-02-20

Again and again throughout the novel she defies the hero and gets them both into trouble.  After the third act of defiance and resulting trouble, I began to skim the book.  It was either that or pull my hair out.  This book was more about violence and rape rather than romance.  The author never showed me the characters falling into love, rather they just did with no apparent reason.  The action in the book was much more the focus rather than the relationship.	2004-02-20
