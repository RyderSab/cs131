While Hofstede may be the man who pioneered cultural research in management, Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner are the men who popularized it within the business world.<br /><br />The six dimensions of culture proposed are simple to understand and relate to. With the numerous examples given throughout the book, cultural encounters suddenly make sense and previously taken for granted 'issues', annoyances, and differences when dealing with other cultures are explained and analyzed. While some of the six dimensions introduced  are in some ways similar to Hofstede's,  five cultural dimensions (for example individualism vs. communitarism); however, the authors also introduce additional dimensions and sometimes expand Hofstede's in ways that make it easier for the reader to understand the differences among cultures.<br /><br />While many scholars claim that the authors' research is not rigorously scientific as that of Hofstede for example, however, it remains a landmark in the field of culture research in management. Perhaps more importantly, it is more accessible to managers and trainers due to the simplicity of the writing style and the numerous examples scattered throughout the book. Overall, a highly readable and useful book that should become essential reading for students of International Business.<br /><br />For people in a hurry and looking for a 'tool box' for dealing with cultural differences; 'Riding the Waves of Culture' by the same authors may be a better option.	2005-06-30

In this book, the authors' target managers and business people who are looking to understand cultural differences and how to deal with them in a variety of circumstances and situations. Each chapter begins with am introduction to one of the dimensions, a discussion of how the differences manifest themselves and concludes with 'tips' on how to deal, and how to do business, with the different culture explored in that chapter.<br /><br />The authors use the same six dimensions of culture introduced in their earlier work (universalism vs. particularism; individualism vs communitarism; specificity vs. diffusion; achieved status vs. ascribed status; inner direction vs. outer direction; and sequential time vs. synchronous time), but they present these dimensions in a much more accessible and simple manner with more emphasis on what each dimension actually means for business people and how it affects business-related situations.<br /><br />This book has become the reference for business people and managers in the area of culture. Simple and very well written without losing credibility; this is a book that will enlighten and guide any manager in dealing with people from other cultures. While in some ways it is a 'western-centric' book (targeted to Western - especially US - managers), it remains very useful for managers from other cultures since the authors have attempted to keep the examples and discussion culturally neutral.	2005-06-30
US	52483430	R1Y8GMZ4ZM7A0F	1558502823	881912434	Hiring The Best	Books	5	14	14	N	N	The best book on hiring & interviewing	This is an extremely well written and very useful book on hiring techniques and methods. The author analyzes all aspects of the hiring process beginning with the different types of resumes and when each type is used; what flags to look for and how to evaluate an applicant's overall resume. Chapter five focuses on short-listing through a `phoner' while the subsequent chapters are devoted to interviewing techniques and the science of asking questions.<br /><br />The author introduces four different interviewing techniques - Situational; personality profile; stress; and & behavioral - and also gives a very useful and informative analysis of the different types of questions that can be asked in a hiring interview like half-right reflexives; hamburger-helper questions; and question layering. In the following chapters, the author focuses on evaluating the candidate's ability and willingness to do the job as well as manageability. The questions and the author's commentary on what to look for and red flags in an applicant's answer are informative, highly usable, and extremely useful. These are not your 'standard' interview questions (though there are some pretty standard questions included). They are well formulated and clever probes into the applicant's skills, knowledge, personality, and background.<br /><br />The rest of the book is devoted to functional areas with a chapter devoted to clerical, management, sales, contingency workers and law hires. Again, I found the advice and suggestions relevant and informative. In formulating the hundreds of question suggestions scattered throughout the book, the author has given a lot of thought to the qualities, experiences, and areas of concern that hiring managers and HR people focus on.	2005-06-27

This book is a simpler and more accessible version of the more comprehensive - but also more difficult, 'Culture's Consequences'.<br /><br />He begins with an excellent overview of culture and its levels and explains the concept of cultural `dimensions' - aspects of culture that can differentiate and measure differences among different cultural groups. The book then proceeds to present the four dimensions of culture that he identified as a result of a massive survey he conducted on IBM employees in 72 countries in 1968 and again in 1972. Additional data was later collected from other countries and populations, outside IBM, and used to verify and enhance the original results.<br /><br />However, in this book, Hofstede discusses his four original dimensions of culture: Power Distance; Uncertainty Avoidance; Individualism & Collectivism; and finally Masculinity & Femininity. The fifth dimension which was later added based on results from the Far East and Asia - Long- versus Short-Term Orientation - is not discussed in this book. Despite that, it remains a very valuable and highly readable introduction to the topic from the man who pioneered the field and popularized it among business people, multinationals and business researchers alike.<br /><br />Hofstede also uses these dimensions of culture to 'classify' organizations to different types according to where they fall on the Power Distance vs. Uncertainty Avoidance grid. The discussion is highly informative and touches on Mintzberg's theories as well typical models of organization in different cultures. In Part Four, he discusses how intercultural encounters are affected by these dimensions and how awareness and acceptance of these differences can yield more effective results.	2005-06-25

The chapters are divided by theory and within each chapter, the author presents a chronological discussion of the evolution of the theory with examples of the field's pioneers and prominent scientist and also the implications and usefulness of these theories in a variety of settings.<br /><br />This is a truly comprehensive discussion of all learning theories to date: Pavlov, Watson, Piaget and Skinner to name but a few as well as chapters on computers and the effect they've had on learning theories and psychology.<br /><br />I found the final four chapters extremely useful. Chapter 12 presents the more recent developments in the field of learning theories and cognitive interpretation. Chapter 13 discusses motivation and its effect on learning and the drive to develop/learn. Chapter 14 is an extremely interesting presentation of the effects of heredity and evolution on learning.<br /><br />Finally, chapter 15 - Learning Theory Past, Present, and Future - is a short and very well written summary of the field in general discussing the issues upon which the learning theories divide and what an ideal theory should look like (should it ever be developed) and finally it concludes with a summary of the value of learning theories.<br /><br />This is not easy reading nor is it a casual introduction to learning theories. It is a text book written for students in psychology and learning. Given the topic and the intended audience, there are some instances where the author's style may become difficult to follow, but it remains better written than a number of other textbooks I've come across.	2005-06-25

From best practices in orientation videos, small businesses, intern & buddy programs to case studies from companies like Ford and Alcatel.<br /><br />The book also includes numerous useful lists, tools and aids that can be reproduced or used as a basic template for planning new orientation as well as evaluating and improving existent programs. In other words, this is a practical book filled with implementable ideas and suggestions guaranteed to make your new hires feel 'special' and at the same time, taking them through all the knowledge and information bits that they need to learn in a fun and engaging manner.<br /><br />I found the case studies chapters very informative and particularly enjoyed Part 5 of the book: Orientation Games & Activities which includes 18 very useful and effective games like the hunt for company policies which turns a normally boring part of any orientation program into a really fun activity.<br /><br />Also quite useful was the Part 6: Orientation Checklists & Surveys covering such areas as 'Before the Employee's First Day'; 'I'm New Here - What Should I Learn?'; and 'A 90-day New Employee Survey'.	2005-06-21

Behavioral interviewing is a technique that stresses questions about past or present behaviors rather than hypothetical or general questions. A behavioral question, for example, would be \\"give me an example of a time when you...\\" as opposed to \\"what would you do if...\\".<br /><br />I found the organization and advice very useful especially the STAR behavioral questions techniques and the chapter on recognizing the difference between what the person SAYS and what (s)he MEANS. In fact, I use STAR (Situations, Tasks, Actions & Results) questions in almost all job interviews since reading the book and the difference in terms of the quality of the answers and information I got is very palpable.<br /><br />The book makes for a friendly and an easy read that provides plenty of practical and useful advice. However, I found that it was a little too focused on the technicality of the interview process. For advice on how to recognize the top performers in job interviews or for specific recruitment advice, I found \\"Hiring the Best\\" by Martin Yate extremely useful.	2005-06-20

While Peck's style is generally engaging and simple, there are times when you might need to re-read his words to get his meaning. This is probably because the subject matter gets your mind working almost from the first word. Each chapter deserves to be read slowly and carefully and therefore, it is not an 'easy' read.<br /><br />This is a book about living; living in a way that sets you apart. It's a book about Life and everything that we normally associate with it and with living. Peck divides the book into four sections: Discipline, Love, Growth & Religion, & Grace. But in these sections he addresses everything from falling in love to solving problems and dealing with pain. The challenge, of course, is doing all of these things in our limited lifetimes, but he writes about that too.<br /><br />Most of us tend to take these `things' for granted; we 'do' them without thinking about the reasons, methods, or the consequences. In the 'The Road Less Traveled', Scott Peck forces us to think about what we do, what we feel, and what we think in different ways that we have not thought of before.<br /><br />Scott Peck combines years of psychotherapy with a natural writing style that attracts the reader and challenges his/her mind. It is not the writing style that makes the book difficult reading (even though there are a few instances in the book when he does become too involved), but the continuous challenge to you mind and to your preconceived ideas. Peck demands that you examine your mind, your feelings and your heart deeply and objectively. Most of us find that difficult.<br /><br />Peck comes across his book as a warm and sensitive person and he makes you feel at ease instantly... What else would you expect from someone whose opening sentence is \\"Life is difficult!\\"	2005-05-31

Beginning with defining the project and communicating it to stakeholders to the final evaluation stages; no aspect of the project has been ignored. Lou Russell liberally provides tools, templates, and ideas that can help organize the whole project from A - Z as well as practical exercises and activities at the end of every chapter that \\"do the work for you\\" should you have picked the book to help you through a particular project.

As the sub-title suggests; this is a &quot;bottom-line primer on HPI&quot; and therefore, it focuses on real-life application. At the same time, the theoretical concepts are explained in a straight-forward manner with just the right amount of detail to guide the reader through the application bits.<br /><br />At the end of each Chapter, you will find additional resources and references should you want to explore that particular topic in more detail as well as an extremely helpful &quot;HPI Challenge&quot; section that guides through applying and using the concepts explored in that chapter.<br />The Chapters closely follow the HPI model itself and are divided into:<br />1: What is HPI?

The reality, however, is that even if ISD is no longer as wide-spread as a decade or two ago, it remains the basis for most of the other 'models' of training design and implementation and is the foundation upon which e-learning was built.<br />As a primer on ISD, this is the best book you're ever likely to come across. Written in a clear manner with tons of useful and practical ideas and guidelines, it is essential reading for both the novice and experiences trainer. As the other reviewers have said, if this is not on every trainer's desk in your organization, then it should be.<br />The book is Divided to Four Sections:<br />1: The Basics of ISD - a short introduction to the model and the concepts of ISD.<br />2: Working through the ADDIE Model - Takes through the steps of the ISD process in more detail and with lots of exercises.<br />3: The Basics of Design and Lesson Plans<br />4: Tips for Success - This is probably the most useful part of the book with numerous ideas and suggestions to avoid common pitfalls and to enhance the process. It also has a special section on e-learning that I found quite useful as an introduction to the topic.<br />Overall, this is an excellent book and highly recommended along with Lou Russel's &quot;Project Management for Trainers&quot; which complements this book but focuses on the operational aspects of managing and implementing the Training project.	2004-05-29

Johanna Lindsey is of course superb, and if the book was written by anyone else, I would have given it one star. However, Lindsay can write beautifully, even when the plot and characters are boring or stereotypical. I found Milisant's character annoying and completely out of character for the era she lived in, at times she truly irritated me to the extent that I would have slapped her had she been real. Her independence seemed pointless and more like pig-headedness than anything else at several points in the story. Her insistence on having her way simply makes her more annoying. Overall, she must rate as one of my least favorite heroines.<br />Wulfric is not as bad as Milisant, but he could have done with some improvements as well. The book does not lack 'fire' between the protagonists, who usually manage to end up at each other's throat, but I found most of the scenes repetitive and the antagonism dragged on much too long.<br />Overall, this is not one of Lindsay's landmarks. Stick to the Malory series by the same author if you want a really satisfying and enjoyable read.	2002-03-13

His book is an excellent blend of science, anecdotal and real-life examples as well as some suggestions for improvement. However, this book is written as an introduction of the topic of emotional intelligence, it is NOT a how-to and it is not a solution to all our life's problems.<br />The book focuses on building emotional intelligence in children, especially school age. This makes it an ideal read for parents and educators who deal with children between the ages of 3 and 10. In fact, I would say it is VITAL reading for parents since it will probably save the parents, and the children of course, years of agony and heartache.<br />The Book is very well written but don't expect it to solve all your emotional intelligence problems. If you want a more practical and useful guide, read Goleman's 'Working with Emotional Intelligence.'	2002-03-11

The book contains everything from an ailing tiger that turns out to be a cat with laryngitis, to a cat-worshiping manservant. Along the way, there is a hateful woman, who ends up conveniently dead, a charming but deadly thief, and of course, the growling cat!<br />The kind-hearted and beautiful Daphne is saddled with a spiteful woman who is scaring away all eligible suitors. When the woman finally dies at the hands (or should I say feet?) of a startled elephant, Daphne hires an eccentric, but adorable woman who falls in love with the Egyptian manservant of Lord Ravenswood. The two plot to get their employers together and along the way, they need to deal with stubborn minds and jealous hearts as well as thieves, cats, deaf butlers...<br />Wonderful book and very entertaining that you'll enjoy reading even if it has a historical accuracy here and there.	2002-03-11

Jo Beverley believes that you can, that love can conquer anything - even that. That is probably the main reason I gave this book 4 stars only.. everything else about it is excellent, but I found the central theme too difficult to swallow.<br />The characters are very well written.. Renald is hard, tough, unyielding.. but oddly vulnerable in his attraction to Claire.. she is defeated, heartbroken and vulnerable, but beautifully strong in her pride and dignity..<br />Very well written.. the twists and turns will surprise you and delight you.. funny at time, heart wrenching at others.. what else can you ask for from a historical romance?	2002-03-07

Sophy never seems 'right' somehow, alternating between strong willed and yielding.. Her character has promise that is never really fully developed in the book.<br />The hero, Ives wants revenge, then he forgets about revenge and decides he wants Sophy, then he wants revenge again, then he wants the spy..?? It seems that the author never really managed to get it all together. There are a lot of loose ends throughout the book and too many questions left unanswered..<br />Overall, I found the plot too thin and too unbelievable. The bit about the spy was obviously forced to add an 'interesting dimension' and had the writer managed to tie all the pieces together, the story would have been excellent..<br />I did manage to finish the book since it did have its moments and it does get better towards the end, so it's not a total write-off.	2002-03-03

I found the relationship between Julian and Eliza touching and their friendship very real and down to earth. The first part of the book is quite enchanting.<br />The relationship between Eliza and Marcus is odd to say the least. Why would a person who is so badly scarred emotionally and physically force a woman to marry him? Why resist her so much if he wants her that badly? Why does she agree to it all? What is the secret she is hiding?<br />There are many things wrong with this book, but it does compel you to finish it! Despite the inaccuracies that will frustrate and irritate you... You still find yourself turning page after page, so... there must be something in it to merit a good rating!!	2002-03-03

All the activities are designed to achieve a purpose and are right on target. The pages are designed so that you can easily follow and understand the activities that are grouped into application area or need.<br /><br />The book covers active training techniques for team building, stimulating discussion, on-the-spot assessments, prompting questions, and reviewing strategies. There are quite a few more, as well a section in the beginning with 'tips' for the trainer, like learning names, timesavers, role-playing, setting-up the training room, etc.<br /><br />You will hardly ever conduct a training that will not benefit from a quick peek into this book and the ideas and suggestions included. I honestly believe that no training bookshelf should be without this book: The activities are targeted, relevant to the subject matter and guranteed to produce the desired results.<br /><br />You will not find any 'wishy-washy' activities and games here nor will you catch yourself yawning as you turn the pages. It's quite the opposite in fact; this book is so well written and well presented, that you just might find yourself going through all the 101 activities! And while you're at it, why don't you check 'Active Training' by Mel Silberman as well - it's a gem of a book...<br /><br />Don't hesitate, this is one purchase you will never regret.	2002-02-28

Some of the activities are quite good especially the breathing exercises and the visualizations. However, there are quite a few activities that are quite ridiculous as well as others that are just not possible at work or in the training room.<br />For trainers, many activities are useful as icebreakers or as stress-reducers after a heated discussion. The reason I bought the book in the first place is because I could not find anything else in that category, so I guess there isn't really that much choice.	2002-02-28

She has to overcome her new clanspeople hostility towards their new English Mistress. She has to deal with a secret enemy who wishes to kill her.

This is the story of one man's obsession for a woman and his patient pursuit of this obsession over a period of years. The Duke of Claymore wanted Whitney Stone, and for her, he was prepared to wait until she grew out from the painful gawky adolescent years and until she became a beautiful lady. In fact, he masterfully orchestrates her transformation and when the time is ripe, when his dream may finally materialize, he finds the elusive Whitney herself obsessed with another man; her childhood crush and neighbor, Paul.<br />How the Duke of Claymore cajoles, seduces and even blackmails Whitney into marriage and the ensuing struggle, often funny, often heart-wrenching is one of the most delightful stories you are likely to read. Both Whitney and Clayton are superbly portrayed and the support characters are also extremely well written.<br />McNaught has a gift for drawing her readers into the book completely and totally. Clayton is one of the best written characters I have come across and McNaught manages to make him completely real despite the fact that he exists in a totally different world.<br />Don't miss this book. Also, check out out 'A Kingdom of Dreams,' the prequel and 'Until You' which is the story of the Stephan Westmoreland.	2002-02-12

In reality, however, most interviewers will agree that there's as much (if not more) information in the questions the candidate asks - or doesn't.<br /><br />This book is suitable for new graduates on their first job hunt as well as veteran job seekers. It can help the veterans by aiding them focus on the areas they want to explore before their interview and the impression they want to leave the interviewer with. It can also help `newbies' and those who simply don't know what to ask by providing numerous with intelligent and targeted questions that are generally important and can be relevant to most situations. Moreover, the author gives good advice on how to ask these questions, when to ask them and why should a a particular question be asked.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake of going through the list and picking the questions that take your fancy without reading the advice - you may inadvertently create a wrong impression and the question may not be even relevant to the organization interviewing you - so make sure you do your homework.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give this book a 5-star rating is because the format and layout were not very friendly.	2002-02-11

For example, 'forgetting your glasses' and `too tight shoes' are aptly put under a special section for `Other Stupid Stuff' and the book would probably have been better off without that section altogether.<br />Having said that, however, some of the problems and the solutions are quite valid and useful especially for the beginning trainer. The book would have a lot better if the problems were chosen based on quality rather than quantity and the solutions explored in greater depth.<br />The Book deals with 7 categories of problems:<br />1) Places you go.<br />2) How you Look and Act.<br />3) Things you Say or Hear.<br />4) Methods &amp; Materials you Use.<br />5) Media and Equipment you depend on.<br />6) Its about Time<br />7) Other Stupid Stuff.	2002-02-10

In fact, some of the concepts explored and researched here form the basis for some of the principles of the Learning Organization.<br /><br />Argyris' discussion of theories-in-use, social virtues and skilled incompetence is a fascinating and eye-opening exercise, some of the examples he provides, while familiar to most of us, are presented in a manner that forces the reader to think, re-think and then re-think again! However, the book is written by an academician largely for academicians. If you want 'easy' reading; then this is not the book for you. If you are, on the other hand, serious about organizational learning, change and human performance, then this book should definitely be on your book-shelf.<br /><br />The Book is organized into 9 chapters. The first 5 chapters explains the concepts, provides examples, and rationale while the remaining chapters (6 to 9) focus on solutions and ideas to overcome these issues.<br /><br />1: Puzzles - An introduction to the types of errors we commit as managers and why we make them.<br />2: Human Theories of Control: Skilled Incompetence - How we develop theories in action, the social virtues we acquire and how do these combine theories to contribute to the errors we make.<br />3: Organizational Defensive Routines - What are organizational defensive routines and how they develop in the organization as a result of the governing values and action strategies of the individuals in the organization. Argyris uses several examples, one of which is the Challenger disaster to demonstrate his points.<br />4: Fancy Footwork and Malaise - Completes the ideas introduced in Chapter 3 with more examples and describes how we actually come to think and act in a manner that contributes to the development of defensive routines and extending it to what Argyris calls \\"fancy footwork\\" and \\"malaise.\\"<br />5: Sound Advice: It Compounds the Problem - Argyris demonstrates that most \\"advice\\" organizations receive will only serve to compound the above problems and not actually solve them.<br />6: Reducing the Organizational Defense Pattern - How to win the pattern against \\"designed ignorance\\" and \\"skilled incompetence.\\"<br />7: Making the New Theory of Managing Human Performance Come True - Introduction to the Commitment Theory of Management and shows how it is aligns well with effective solutions for overcoming organizational defenses, fancy footwork, and malaise.<br />8: Getting from Here to There - How to apply the concepts from chapters 6 and 7 to produce better, more effective organizations<br />9: Upping the Ante - Describes the practices that minimize the organizational defenses, the mind-set needed to overcome \\"denial\\" and raise the bar for the entire organization.Compounds the Problem - Argyris demonstrates that most \\"advice\\" organizations receive will only serve to compound the above problems and not actually solve them.  6: Reducing the Organizational Defense Pattern - How to win the pattern against \\"designed ignorance\\" and \\"skilled incompetence.\\"   7: Making the New Theory of Managing Human Performance Come True - Introduction to the Commitment Theory of Management and shows how it is aligns well with effective solutions for overcoming organizational defenses, fancy footwork, and malaise.  8: Getting from Here to There - How to apply the concepts from chapters 6 and 7 to produce better, more effective organizations  9: Upping the Ante - Describes the practices that minimize the organizational defenses, the mind-set needed to overcome \\"denial\\" and raise the bar for the entire organization.	2002-02-10

The Learning Organization remains one of the most talked-of management concepts in today's business world, and nobody is as capable of explaining exactly what is a Learning Organization or what are the requirements for such an elusive concept than Peter Senge.<br />Senge's main thesis is that for an organization to become a Learning organization, it must embrace five disciplines:<br />1) Building Shared Vision so that the organization may build a common commitment to long term results and achievement.<br />2) Mental models are a technique that can be used to foster creativity as well as readiness and openness to change and the unexpected.<br />3) Team Learning is needed so that the learning is passed on from the individuals to teams (i.e. the organization as a whole).<br />4) Personal Mastery is the individual's motivation to learn and become better (hence the term Mastery).<br />and Finally<br />5) The fifth discipline is that of Systems Thinking which allows to see a holistic systemic view of the organization as a function of its environment.<br />However, this is not simply a book about management practice.. though it was written primarily for the use managers. This is a book about growth, improvement and continuous development.
