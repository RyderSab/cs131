It would simply not have occurred to him to put his message up on a sign above his front door.\\" well, what's your point? of valerie export: \\"The Austrian artist Valerie Export devoted herself in her feminist Actions to historical manifestations of female body language (ill. right).\\" the illustration referred to shows export wearing a box; what is not explained is that this permits men to grope her bared breasts in public. of chris burden: \\"Chris Burden set out on a voyage of self-discovery via his own body (ill. below left).\\" what does that mean? the illustration referred to shows two video captures of burden's face and two figures, one pointing a rifle at the other; what is unexplained is that burden is having himself shot in the arm, or why that is interesting. and on and on ...<br /><br />it is not all that difficult to select representative or important works of art from the 20th century -- auction prices and critical reputation can guide the way. on that criterion these two volumes are well done. it's quite another thing to illuminate, explain, contextualize and connect the enormously rich history of art over the past 100 years, and that is where this overview is a serious disappointment.	2003-05-02

(someone should ask, where are the edges in monet or turner, the color in kline or velazquez, the movement in vermeer or van dyck?) on the philosophical side, zeki seems willing to cite plato or hegel as straw men to knock down, but seems completely unaware of the many philosophical or social psychological theorists who could enrich his \\"active construction\\" view of visual perception. finally, zeki seems not to have had a personal colloquy with practicing artists, who could disabuse him of his naive reading of western art and its traditions.<br />psychologists will find this book to be unexpectedly thin on the facts of recent neural research and cognitive function, and lacking in philosophical depth. artists will look at zeki's simplistic reading of art and art history, shrug and wonder, what is this guy talking about?	2003-03-30

(like any buried memory, perspective surfaces in the dreamlike digital animations of intergalactic science fiction and first person computer games, which take perspective effects to the ultimate level of technical accuracy and artistic triviality.) kemp unearths those repressed perspective memories and shows how vital they were to the development of art and the connections between art and the wider culture of the times.<br /><br />it is jaw droppingly fun to see how intensive, sophisticated and singleminded was the artistic interest in optical and perceptual issues of seeing. everyone will find special surprises here, but mine include kemp's spatial analysis of velazquez's \\"las meninas,\\" and the extraordinary drawings and engravings produced c.1800, which force us to realize that we are already looking at \\"photo graphs,\\" light drawings created by hand, at a time when film photography was not yet practical. there is a large section on various optical devices utilized in visual arts, including the camera obscura and camera lucida, and an excellent section on the evolving understanding and use of color, from the renaissance to seurat.<br /><br />poignant for me was the victorian fascination with light as a spiritual quality, which comes through in turner's paintings and ruskin's amazing perspectival studies of \\"clouds\\" -- images that verge on op art. the intelligence and strength of these images reveal a road left untraveled in art, which turned toward the perceptually driven styles of impressionism and fauvism instead. as a bonus to the many interesting visual exhibits, the writing is lucid, sensible and alert. an invaluable publication.	2003-01-01

(the translucent muscle diagrams are especially neat: they fold over matching full color photographs of head, limbs and torso, though the book bindery doesn't always line up the two exactly.) a bonus is the unique and interesting introductory history of anatomical studies. the coverage is broad stroke -- focusing on large muscle groups, or anatomical units such as the hand, not on individual bones or muscles. my disappointments include the appallingly skimpy treatment of facial emotions, the breezy anatomical descriptions (one gets a poor idea of individual muscle form and action), the narrow sampling of model physical types (all are gorgeous), and the fatuous gallery of simblet sketches, who likes to draw bodies piled on top of each other. for practical work, i much prefer eliot goldfinger's masterful \\"encyclopedia\\" of human anatomy for the artist, but simblet's book is easier to use as a quick or general reference and also makes a provocative browse for your dinner guests. best is to own both, and go to goldfinger if your question requires authoritative, in depth information.	2002-10-27

(some internal musculature is omitted because it does not affect surface form, but there is extensive information and photo documentation on the facial expression of emotions, largely based on the classic research by ekman and friesen.) this \\"inside out\\" approach also determines the content of the 1 to 3 page descriptions of each bone and muscle. in the section on muscles, four diagrams show the skeletal muscle attachments, isolated muscle form, form within surrounding muscles, and surface appearance in lean models, usually from two different points of view. schematic diagrams analyze muscle form into its basic shapes, or show the mechanical effects of muscle contraction. the text is often heavy going but presents unusually detailed and clear explanations of muscle attachments, action, form and interaction with other muscles or joints. there is also much information not available anywhere else, and all sex differences in anatomy (for example in the abdominal musculature and hip bones) are described in the text. goldfinger's goal is to provide the artist with the information necessary to identify the bones and muscles contributing to surface form in any model, any physique or any pose, and i have never found it to fail that purpose.for a breezier and visually more attractive approach, simblet's book is preferable.	2002-10-27

Like they say on TV: if you buy just one watercolor book, make it this one. <br />Dewey gives equal emphasis to materials, theory, technique, the principles of design, and simple practice. He sees the whole art. He begins with an overview of paint manufacturers, brushes, papers and other supplies, and closes with an invitation to try mixed media and a step-by-step explanation of how to do a large studio painting. There are penetrating discussions of color theory and mixing paints, on selecting the palette for each painting, and on building a painting from value sketches. <br />The technical advice in this book is exceptionally accurate and easy to understand. The four pages explaining how to paint washes avoid the errors or omissions common in most other books. All topics are illustrated with pictures that add information rather than decorate the page. Dewey includes several traditional techniques that other methods don't mention: pen and ink wash drawings, value design sketches, using a sketchbook, monochrome paintings, color chords for color design, the &quot;color&quot; of gray, and much more. The book is so compactly organized that many gems of advice are tucked in the picture captions; the book can be studied repeatedly and still teach something new. <br />Dewey has painted the student lessons and technical examples displayed throughout the book. The more advanced lessons build on simple but beautifully designed demonstration paintings (my favorite is the still life on a patterned rug).  Everything comes together in a harmonious vision of watercolor art, a reference and inspiration for many hours of happy experimentation and learning.	2001-02-15

(hollingdale, by comparison, comes off as wooden and  wordy.) the range of works here is extreme -- from the poetical, dense  &quot;zarathustra&quot; to the lucid and elementary &quot;twilight&quot;  and &quot;antichrist,&quot; which together provide an excellent summary of  nietzsche's basic ideas and deliciously clear examples of his treacherously  paralogical argumentative methods. nietzsche, like freud, proceeded by  telling fables, and philosophy has never been the same since. kaufmann's  notes are excellent, particularly for the cryptic symbolism of  &quot;zarathustra&quot;. (note: kaufmann's translations of nietzsche's more  academic, formal texts are gathered in his &quot;basic nietzsche,&quot;  which i also highly recommend.)	1999-11-30

It's the central volume in a three-volume set of Nabokov's autobiography and English fiction (excluding the short stories), including his finest achievements -- Lolita, Pnin and Pale Fire. The two versions of Lolita (as novel and screen adaptation) are illuminating to read together: the novel is created within Humbert's subjective and self-serving memory, while in the screenplay Nabokov reimagines the story as objective action. I was also intrigued to find that some obvious departures from the novel in Kubrick's film -- such as the opening scene of Humbert shooting Quilty, or the high school prom scene -- are ideas taken from the Nabokov screenplay (in turn fragments of the novel excised in the final version). Brian Boyd offers an impeccable text, much improved over the paperback editions, with a chronology of the author's life. This is the volume to choose if you unravel Nabokov's narrative patterns with your own marginal notes and comments, and want a volume that won't disintegrate in a nymphet's span of years.	1998-08-05

A must hear! <br />Lolita is lovely because many themes thread through it in a unique combination of light-and-shadow plot and harmoniously chosen words. The plot highlights the dismal difference between love and lust; the many kinds of betrayed love and confidence that radiate from Humbert's (villain) lust and Lolita's (victim) rejection; there's a panoramic background of American mid-century landscape and culture; the weird mystery story of the Aztec Red convertible and Humbert's cunning &quot;brother&quot; in pedophilic crime; there is the guilt of destroying a loved one in the act of fulfilling one's desires; most of all, there is the overarching idea that &quot;mirage and reality merge in love.&quot;<br />It's in this iridescent misty landscape between fantasy and reality that Naboko! v's love affair with English creates breathtaking passages of clarity, comedy and moral pain.	1998-07-21
