This is the Kesey novel that nobody read after One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest stole all its thunder. Although it was filmed with an great cast (Henry Fonda, Paul Newman) it never gained the reputation that its inferior sibling achieved.<BR> This is, quite simply, one of the great classics of the 20th century. Its pace and moody evocation of the American North West are stunning. The collision between the traditional and the modern, the past and the present make riveting, enthralling reading. <BR> The Stamper family are loggers, rough, hard men and women who care for no ones opinion but their own. They are fighting the union, the neighbours, the town, their whole world. Their motto of \\"never give an inch\\" was the title of the film of the book. Into the strike-breaking start of the book comes the dope-smoking, college educated half brother, the prodigal son. His arrival triggers a tidal wave of events that spiral gradually out of control until everything that has been permanent before is now threatened.<BR>If I seem vague in this review it is simply that I don't want to deprive you of the pleasure of discovering this story for yourself. This is one of the forgotten masterpieces. A book to be read, and then passed on to friends who are later bullied to give it back to be read again.	2001-11-18

The Family of Man is a touching, beautiful, horrifying, funny, tragic, poignant collection of photos.

Accompanied by the Ds, whom avid readers will know from earlier AR books, they turn detective and track down the villians who are casting off boats on the Norfolk Broads. As usual Arthur Ransome was writing in a class of his own. A note of caution: don't imagine that Norfolk and the surrounding countryside, especially Lowestoft, bears any resemblance to the places described in these books.

Eric Newby's account of his trip to the Hindu Kush is a book both daunting and delightful. He makes light of the incompetence and ignorance of both himself and his companion in the realm of climbing and exploring. Yet what they achieve is nothing short of remarkable, given their level of ignorance. Perhaps a more experienced team would have sensibly given up in the face of hunger, illness and cold. Messrs. Newby and Carless soldier on and the account, understandably slightly incoherent, is both funny, self-deprecating and very, very readable. Their account of a chance meeting with the famous explorer Wilfred Thesiger is recounted, far less humorously, by the great man in one of his recent books.	2001-09-25

He tells the tale of Jim Wormold, a vacuum cleaner salesman who lives quietly in Havana and worries about his devoutly Catholic teenage daughter whom he is raising as a single parent. He is unexpectedly recruited, in a public toilet, by the British Secret Service to &quot;keep an eye on things&quot; in Cuba. When no obvious &quot;things&quot; present themselves, Wormold decides to invent agents and situations to pad his reports. But then things start to go wrong and reality begins to mirror fiction.<BR>Graham Greene captures the sleepy, sensual heat of the Caribbean perfectly. His characters are extraordinarily vividly painted and the book lurches wildly from comedy to tragedy to farce, damning the bureaucrats, the police and the sinister, grey men of the secret services along the way. With The Comedians and Brighton Rock this must surely rank as one of Mr Greene's best entertainments.	2001-09-25

This is the real thing; a book about settling in a new country, buying a house (the funniest chapter in the book) and the slow realisation that, politically, the situation is becoming untenable. Bitter Lemons, which starts off so optimistically, is a sad commentary on the inability of people to get along with each other.

Ulysses	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Not what you'd expect from this author	Alastair Maclean's books tend to run along formulaic lines - the good guy good humouredly taking a fearful beating, the bad guy snarlingly getting his eventual comeuppance. Whether it's a Formula One race track, an island in the Barents Sea or a submarine beneath the polar ice cap, the pattern is unshakeable. Not bad, you understand, but familiar.<BR>This book, however, is completely different. Mr Maclean served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and took part in several convoys similar to those described in this book. His experiences have coloured his writing and given this book an immediacy and a depth that the others lack. This book serves as a tribute to the men that lost their lives in the fearful Arctic Convoys of World War Two, a critical theatre of war that was largely forgotten.	2001-09-25

History may judge him harshly, but this book is an incredible adventure story and worth reading for its coverage of Stalin's purges alone. Fitzroy Maclean was apparently Ian Fleming's model for his most famous creation, James Bond. Whether stooging quietly around the back of beyond in Stalin's Soviet Union, sneaking across the Sahara to launch raids far behind German lines in World War Two or hiking through the vertical  mountains of Yugoslavia Maclean is both modest and reticent. But the adventures he has are so outrageous that anything but a self-deprecating approach would seem both boastful and wildly improbable. With Eric Newby and Wilfred Thesiger, this man was the last of a particular breed of Englishmen. The world will be a poorer place for their passing.	2001-09-25

Surprisingly however, Mr Innes has crafted a gripping tale of family honour, double-cross, exploration, romance and a terrific boardroom climax.  The story sweeps from the stock markets of London to the remote reaches of the South China Sea, from dusty lawyer's offices in Threadneedle Street to the reeking cabin of a disgraced ship's captain on a broken down hulk. Through it all, Mr Innes writes with flair and originality and the result is an adventure story with a much broader sweep than the usual fare. The characters are complex and finely drawn. The hero is not an infallible man; he has doubts and fears like all of us, and the villains are made villainous, not by their evil intentions but through their all too human frailties. Sad to see this book is out of print but second-hand copies should be easy to find.	2001-09-25

Pinkie, the boy gangster is stalked by the implacable Ida, the good time girl turned avenger. The plot twists and turns upon itself like a dying snake and the characters plod grimly on their tracks, helpless before their destiny. Mr Greene has brought many elements to his book. there is the ever present Catholicism, the burden of guilt, the fear of Hell's fire. Ida, the avenger, is as dogged and merciless in her own way but, feeling Right on her side, has fewer qualms than Pinkie for all his evil nature. Surely this must rank as one of Mr Greene's greatest books and that, given his range and mastery of the written word, is praise indeed.	2001-09-25

The stirring story of the war hero, Douglas Bader, who lost both legs in a plane crash before the war but came back to become one of the great flying aces of the Battle of Britain. This respectful biography does not disguise the fact that Mr Bader must have been a forceful, difficult personality to deal with. The Germans who imprisoned him after he was shot down certainly found him hard to cope with. After numerous escape attempts they resorted to taking away his artificial legs, and eventually sent him to the POW camp for perennial bad boys, Colditz. After the war Bader went on to a successful career with a petroleum company and continued to fly his own plane all over the world. This is not a dirt-digging, expos biography such as is fashionable in these days of media overload,  but it is a bare-bones, well written story of a remarkable man's remarkable life.	2001-09-25

Spanning the short adult life of Sebastian Flyte, it is told retrospectively through the eyes of his friend and former lover Charles, who goes on, once youthful experimentation is over, to carry on an equally passionate and hopeless love affair with Sebastian's sister. But in some ways, these themes are not the great story. The larger pictures are of the slackening grip of British aristocracy, the power of love and the power of Faith. Waugh paints a masterpiece of the sweet, desperate years between the wars, at Oxford, in London and Paris, with one generation lost and the next helplessly watching history lurching towards a repetition of the same madness.	2001-09-25

I recommend the reader work through all three but really, the first two can be read alone perfectly satisfactorily. <BR>Mr Peake invokes an ancient castle set in no particular time where ritual has become as much part of the fabric of life as food. For Titus, young heir to the kingdom, there is no escaping the drudgery of court life. Every day of the year his movements are proscribed by the ancient tomes that are cared for and interpreted first by Sourdust, then Barquentine and finally the arch villain, Steerpike. The atmosphere is Gothic, surreal, as menacing and slow as a quicksand. The characters are bizarre freaks moving against the dark, grim backdrop of the castle. Overwhelmed by all this tradition, Titus rebels and quickly finds himself at odds with the very fabric of his ancient home. His allies and his enemies take their sides and begin their macabre dance and, to use Mr Peakes phrase, Titus is wading through his childhood. Fantastic.	2001-09-25

The Night Manager definitely falls into the former category. Jonathan Pine is the manager of a hotel in Switzerland, formal, correct, impeccable. But, like all le Carre's characters his placid exterior hides a multitude of depths. His mission is to bring down the \\"worst man in the world.\\" Roper, the millionaire, gun runner, invulnerable friend of government ministers, philanthropist, doting father. Pine must infiltrate, seduce, outwit and destroy the empire that Roper has built. The tension is maintained perfectly and the everyday manner in which the characters go about their deadly business makes the book all the more riveting. If the final denouement is slightly disappointing, as if perhaps the author found himself in a cul de sac with no way out, overall, the story holds together wonderfully. And let's face it, at least he didn't finish with, \\"And then Jonathan woke up.\\"	2001-09-25

This time they are sailing a small schooner through little-charted waters in the China Sea. After a disastrous fire on board, they are washed ashore, along with Captain Flint (Nancy and Peggy's Uncle Jim if you are not familiar with these books) on a small chain of islands and captured by Chinese pirates. Those over-sensitive souls among us may find the depiction of Chinese natives, and the rendition of their accents, less than PC, but I read this book for the first time at the impressionable age of nine and I don't think it coloured my attitude to Chinese people in any negative way. What this books does, as superbly as all Mr Ransome's others, is convey the excitement that children feel if they are allowed a little freedom. Our poor children today, molly-coddled and over-protected by our anxious selves can only dream of adventures such as these. Luckily, they have books like this to transport them to such faraway places where we, as parents, cannot interfere.	2001-09-25

Like a film with only one memorable character, the book is fine as long as Bader is on the page. Mr Lucas unfortunately devotes endless space to describe the machinations of various characters in the Air Ministry as well as the comings and goings of the faceless executives of Shell Oil, a company that Mr Lucas appears to work for, so fulsome is his praise. Paul Brickhill's original biography, Reach For the Sky does a much better job of telling the bare bones of Douglas Bader's amazing life. It is obvious that Mr Lucas has taken great pains not to simply reiterate the well-known facts, but by not doing so he seems to play down much of what Douglas Bader was about. The gripping nature of the subject saves this book from faltering completely but the  flat, dull chapters about long-forgotten disputes in the corridors of power, and the somewhat turgid prose style left this reader underwhelmed.	2001-09-25

Jerome, you know you are in for something special and this book does not disappoint you. Originally conceived as a guide to the River Thames, Three Men in a Boat, is the funniest, maddest book you are ever likely to find about something as simple as idling down a river in a small boat. The book ranges far and wide beyond the scope of either a travel guide or a memoir. It is full of little anecdotes about such things as barometers and hypochondria. It makes mention of the pleasures and perils of having your boat towed by girls. It explains the dangers posed by swans and the perils of eating canned pork pies. Whilst the style is from a gentler age, the book is never stuffy or boring. The humour is as fresh today as it was when Queen Victoria was on the throne. This book is so funny that I had to stop reading it on the London Underground where laughter and frivolity are frowned upon.	2001-09-25

Set in Australia, it tells the story of a diverse group of characters who are waiting to die. The whole Northern hemisphere has been obliterated by nuclear war and the clouds of fallout are drifting slowly southward. While they wait, their characters are gradually revealed, like a painting appearing as years of accumulated grime are carefully wiped away. When this book was written it had an enormous impact. People really believed that a nuclear holocaust was likely, if not inevitable, in their lifetimes. For some years, the threat receded but the events of September 11th 2001 have brought those fears back. The weapons are still in their silos, the submarines are still on their stations. We can but hope that sanity will one day prevail. In any case, this book should be read for its poignancy, its beautiful yet simple plot and its optimism in the face of tragedy.	2001-09-25

His characters and the evocation of wartime Alexandria are so perfect that you can taste the perfume on Justine's neck, hear the call from the mosques and smell the blood of camels butchered in the streets. Here are poets and prostitutes, diplomats and gun runners. There are scenes of lust and love and violence and despair. The characters mutate as the story unfolds and then convolutes upon itself again. We are as confused as the characters themselves and never find ourselves in a position where we understand events before they do. Myriad scenes tumble upon each other; a bird shoot on Lake Mareotis, the masqued ball, the strange death of Pursewarden, the dreadful death of Narouz.  Across four volumes Durrell seldom puts a foot wrong and while his florid prose is not to everyone's taste, nobody can deny that this is one of the under rated classics of the twentieth century. After the grim years of the Second World War and the grey, slow grind of the 1950s, the novel must have burst upon literary Europe like a comet streaking across the sky. It is an essential book for anyone who considers themselves well-read.	2001-09-25

Kiplings classic volume of stories concerns the great questions of history; How the Whale got his Throat, How the Camel got his Hump, How the Alphabet was Made and many other thorny dilemmas. The language is sophisticated yet often whimsical and children love to hear the words read aloud. It is tempting to scan ahead and change things, substitute more contemporary phrases for the old but, if you can, resist the urge. Kipling was a master of the language. His writing is balanced and fluid and while it may seem dated when taken piece by piece, its sum is far greater than its parts.

A sad commentary on our society that only the audio versions of this book are available. With the increase of interest in the First World War recently it is to this book that many people should turn for a gripping, factual account of life before, during and after the Great War. Mr Graves documents the pastoral quiet of England in the early part of the twentieth century and abruptly descends to recounting, in cold detail, the dreadful slaughter of the trenches. Through some of the most famous battles in history he survives, physically more or less intact but from the dry words; modest, English, reserved, we glimpse the true weight of the burden that such memories impose on their carriers and understand better the terrible toll that the War levied on all the nations of Europe.	2001-09-25

Mr Mitchell has crafted an enormously readable history of the region. The detail is extraordinary but the prose never becomes turgid or obtuse. By examining the intertwined complexities of people's relations to the land and their Gods, Mr Mitchell has broken new ground and produced a book that is that most unusual of beasts, both readable and scholarly.	2001-09-25

The Moshulu, a four masted barque is docked in Belfast and conditions aboard her are not much different from a hundred years earlier. Added to his difficulties is the lingua franca of the ship (Finnish), his youth and innocence (eighteen years old), and an apparent hatred of Englishmen conceived by almost everyone on board. Needless to say the resulting book is hilarious, wonderfully informative and close to being poetic in places. A word of warning. This edition contains none of the black and white photographs that were included in the original Penguin paperback. Some may be found in the same author's books, What the Traveler Saw and the recent publication, Learning the Ropes (both equally recommended)	1999-05-26

For anyone who  believes the sexual revolution didn't begin until the Sixties, this book  will be an eye-opener. In the style of contemporary biography MacNiven  covers a myriad of detail yet the book is never boring, perhaps because  Durrell himself was never boring. Contentious, abusive, drunken, humorous,  talented, complex, depressive, yes but never dull. This is not a  sensationalist biography. The author was the subject's friend - the project  was offered to him - and a certain respect is evident even in the passages  that cover some of the more dubious aspects of Durrell's life.  Durrell  knew some of the great literary figures of the 20th century including Henry  Miller, T.S. Eliott, Anais Nin, and he lived through some of the most  interesting times. His books are rich in a sense of place, the descriptions  of Cyprus, of Alexandria, of Provence convey the smells, the sounds, the  heat and the cold. A good companion to this biography is Spirit of Place, a  collection of Durrell's letters and essays, many of which are quoted from  here. Lawrence Durrell seems to have slipped slightly from fashion, a fact  he would no doubt find amusing, as long as enough money continued to come  in. Perhaps this biography will help to rekindle an interest in his books,  especially the Alexandrian Quartet and Bitter Lemons, probably his least  obscure prose.	1998-10-09

Don't read this book unless you have read the previous sixteen in the series. It's not that this book is bad on its own but simply that you will miss so much by not having grown with Aubrey and Maturin as they make their way through the shoals and lee shores of war and peace, marriage and separation, famine and feast. These books have been compared with the Hornblower series but this damns them with faint praise. They are, in every respect, far superior, truly works of great literature. The research and the depth of character development are staggering achievements on their own but these are no stuffy historical tracts; the pages are filled with sly humour. There are great acts of courage and infamy and sweeping tragedy. There is the story, which threads its way through all the books, of a lasting, deep friendship between two disparate personalities. The scenes of battle, winning and losing are among the best writing of this century. Think I exaggerate? Buy the first three books in the series and see for yourself.	1998-05-09

Several factors came together to bring this book to my attention. I have listened to Noah Adams measured tones on NPRs All Things Considered for years. I studied piano reluctantly for fifteen of my first nineteen years on Earth.(Jewish fathers always want their sons to be doctors by day and concert pianists by night)But most importantly, at the age of forty, with years of neglecting the piano behind me, I had almost decided to buy one again and not only try, belatedly, to justify my expensive lessons but also inflict something similar, but less obsessive, on my own son.Mr Adams book is a beautiful memoir, gentle and ardent. It is a fine blend of history, anecdote, experience and passion. A fifty year old man, successful and assured takes on a challenge - to learn to play the piano - and brings us, month by month, through trepidation, irritation and confidence and joy to the emotional ending that leaves one wishing the book could be longer. I will buy that piano this month.	1998-04-08

Though quite old now, these books will never be dated because they talk to children in their own language, the language of desperate acts and dashed hopes, unexpected reversals and stunning victories. These pages are crammed with the joy of summer holidays, far from the drudgery of school and the unwanted solicitousness of anxious parents.Later in the series the action moves from the Lake District to the Fens, to Scotland, to the Caribbean and even to pre-Communist China. Throughout the series Arthur Ransome manages to introduce wildly diverse characters without ever losing the original threads that make these books so entertaining. If you buy nothing else for your eight year old reader this year, start him or her on this series with Swallows and Amazons	1997-08-09

There is no paper, no hand, no pen, no block. There is the void, the silence, and the act of creation and when you stop, there is your novel, complete and perfect before you on the page. Well, alright, perhaps not perfect but this marriage of Zen and common sense, beautifully written and blazingly clear, is a wonderful manual for any writer.Indeed for anyone that takes a moment to look at the world around them, anyone who does more than simply move unthinkingly through their life like a robot, this book is a rare delight. Once read thoroughly, it can be used randomly as an antidote to writer's block. Open almost any page and begin reading to feel the log jam in your cortex start to shift and jostle. Your fingers flex, your eye sparkles. The words tumble over themselves as ideas outpace your hand and your writing becomes a hellish scrawl. Buy a computer and take a speed typing course.  My thanks to Ms Goldberg for a truly inspirational book.	1997-06-17
