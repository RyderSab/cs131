The guy would have virtually no chance against Ayrton Senna in Williams-Renault, back in 1994. But Senna died, and Hill, a driver who had never achieved absolutely nothing in the lesser formulas, suddenly became William´s Number One.<br />And such a Number One he became. Learning fast, he almost secured te World Tittle already in 1994, had not MIchael Schumacher played dirty in the Australian Grand Prix. (do you need any other proof that the machine is much more important than the driver in modern Formula One? Hill was in his second season, had never showed any signs of above-average skill, and was almost the World Champion - courtesy of  Williams-Renault, not his skills)<br />In the following years, Hill became the main contender against Germany´s robot Michael Schumacher, the most victorious driver ever in F-1. And won his Championship in 1996.<br />This book gives a lesson: you can learn with the passing of time, it´s never late to believe you can be succesfull in something you desire a lot (ok, I admit that being the son of Graham Hill would help you a lot...)	2003-07-15

But King blew it.<br />The friendship between the five characters is very touching, I really enjoyed it. But the book keep coming back and forth, the Kurtz character is so cliched, the flatulence stuff is atrocious, the ending is disappointing. And there´s noc lear explanation to what will happen. And it takes so LONG to finally understand (more or less) how the aliens operate, how the fungus work and why there´s that canibal worm.<br />But King is such a master writer that even so I found myself reading it fast and anxious to reach the end.	2003-07-11

Ellroy wrote a book where 99,9% of all characters are vile and mean, totally indecent and immoral, including the ones with real names!<br />Kemper Boyd and Pete Bondurant are pure killers and even when Ellroy talks about the background of these characters, we simply can not care about their welfare: we just despise them. Ward Littel begins with a little more possibility of being a good man, but soon is also lost to \\"evil\\"...<br />Totally original here is the courage to introduce real life characters as Hoover and the Kennedy brothers and insert dialogues in their mouths freely. Amazing technique, it works wonderfully!<br />This is a great book, but don´t go for it expecting to find nice words or poetry..it´s about a society nasty, cheap and corrupt.<br />By the way, even before reading this book, is there someone else out there that still thinks that Lee Oswald acted alone...?	2002-11-25

Slowly, day by day, people alla round the world, even in the developed countries, are discovering whom the International Monetary Fund serves: the rich.<br />What we must remember is that the Fund, since its inception in 1944, NEVER had the purpose of eliminate global poverty or to develop poor countries. He was created just to maintain the GLOBAL economy stable. Just that.<br />But, searching this goal, it began to think of themselves as masters of the world (the poor world). It began to say to sovereign countries how to act, what to do or not. He began to destroy whole economies. He began do serve the rich guys like George Soros and others, even if by chance.<br />Its technical body is filled with bureoucratic economists who don´t know nothing about life in poor countries. They´re just a bunch of scholars with doctor degrees, but with no touch with truth. They simply do not care for the millions of lives they´re suffocating withe their demands and their dirty dollars.<br />That´s what the author wrote about. He´s not against globalization. He´s against the wayy the powerful are using it to get richer and richer and richer, while the poor become poorer and poorer and poorer. It´s not a lie. Statistic data from the World Bank itself shows that!<br />A great book. Of course, it can be hard to swallow it or understand it if you´re living in a rich country, or is part of the elite of a poor country. But if you´re on the other side of the coin, you´ll see how right Mr. Stiglitz is...	2002-10-15

This means that the writer, altough a real expert in comic book history, could not deal with all the subjects in a neutral way all the time. So, what we have is, generally, praise after praise for this mighty (with justice) company, but no real insight into their history. Of course, there is not space for such, since the book is crowded with magnific art from various artists and various comics. I think it lacked appendices, which could have lists of Marvels greates artists, MArvels greatest selling books, Marvels greates histories. The book is also clearly outdated, since it was first published in 1992. Since then, there was the &quot;mutiny&quot; from the artists (Silvestri, Jim Lee and McFarlane, amongst others) who left to form their own company; the writer, altough mentions it, doesnt explain why Stan Lee, whose role in the company since 1980 is to supervise adaptations to movies and animated features, permitted such lousy adaptations as THE PUNISHER, for example. It does not touch the fact of how the artists were totally underpaid until Jim Shooter was Editor-In-Chief, nor how Lee permitted one editor after another to resign due to the sheer impossibility of editing 54 books at the same time. All in all, this book is great for the art, but for text PEter Sandersons work, MARVEK UNIVERSE, is better.	2001-11-19

This book by Manstein is horrible. How can someone say it is good? That he was a master general ? THis book is another one of those books written by German generals and field marshalls that, since Hitler was dead, took full advantage of the fact to place the blame of all bloody bath caused by the German armed forces (and their posterior defeat) into Hitlers shoulder, why everything good (victories, etc) was their responsibility. In reading this book, it becomes clear how German generals succumbed to Hitler and did and they could to give victory to the mad man, and after the war they said that they could not have anything different, that their &quot;oath'&quot; prevented them to get Hitler ouf of power. Come on!!! Do you think we are so naive?!!!! The general received bribbery all the war long, it is a proved fact.

Altough it is focused mainly on Bon Scott ( for the simple reason of the mans unbeliavable great charisma ), of course it deals a lot about AC/DCs career until the &quot;HIGHWAY TO HELL&quot; album. YOu have to got a little patience in the first hundred pages or so, when the book deals with all the secundary bands Bon worked before joining the Young Brothers. But this phase is fundamental in understanding the mans backgorund and way of life. Of course there is no official quote from AC/DC actual members ( AC/DC would never permit it!!!), but a lot of interviews from ex-bassist Mark Evans. What becomes clear after reading the book (what was already clear for clear-minded fans) is how the band lost creativity after Bon died, mainly in the lyrical department.  The book reveals that some years ago the band even contemplated sacking Brian Johnson (the guy just cant sing or scream anymore - its awful !!). The band today is almost an &quot;Institution&quot;, like the Stones (thats why they released only two albuns in the entire period since 1991)and losing their second singer could be a definitive blow to the band. All in all, this book is a must have.	2001-06-11

So, I supose what Ill say below will leave many of his fans upset. The truth is the following: this book is boring. The concept is grandious, the creation of Arda magnific, the battle between the elves and Melkor amazing. But Tolkiens style is typical of some British writers. It is dry. Even when he writes about beautiful moments or beautiful scenarios, its dry and emotionless, almost if it was just a newsman relating it. So, enduring reading the whole book is already a victory.

Except for  an absurd attack to old people in Chapter 5 (blaming them for all deficits in the country )the book has good  comments and good research, being written in the &quot;catastrophic&quot;  style.	2000-05-23

There is censorship problem, excess of patriotism, total lack of informations concerning the other side (the enemy  side)and narrative tales normally full of hate for the enemy (of course).  This is another book. The writer, an accomplished newsman, really tried to  write a good book, but it failed miserably. For you, an air-combat reader,  this will be a great deception...	2000-05-23

This book contains detailed data, written in a clear way, about life in Arthurs age, beginning in the year 510 after CHrist. THe only flaw is the combat system, which is too violent. Of course, a  battle till death is a violent event, but after loosing so much time  developing your character, you discover how easy is to be killed using this  combat system. ANyway, the authors give you a perfect set-up to go aboard a  journey of history, not only a journey of killing, earning gold or casting  spells,like AD&amp;D does, for exxample.	2000-04-19

Written with the intention of putting down some bad feelings left behind from his previous book (1975) &quot;I AM NOT SPOCK&quot;, and without the help of a  ghost-writer, Nimoy writes in a particular style Id call &quot;Friendship  style&quot;, clearly respecting his fans and tryin to give a general  picture of what really was (is) his life, not even in one moment showing  indulgence or arrogance.

This book is fantastic, even for someone who doesnt know Maiden properly, because, describing Maides rise to the top, it gives us a great general picture of the music industry. I only didnt give it 5-stars because I think writer Mick Wall (maybe because this is an official biography) didnt have the guts to tell the truth about Maidens line-up with singer Blaze  Bayley aboard. Every honest fan knows that this phase ( ) , and Wall  finishes the book saying what a  great prospect lay ahead of the band, with  this singer, a new phase, creativity, the band is strong, etc, etc, etc.  Only a few months later, this &quot;great&quot; singer was fired and Bruce  Dickinson and Adrian Smith rejoined the band.	2000-04-19

Because everybody says that Hemingway is a genius  (he is), one cant assume the fact that this book is a pile of garbage; it  is pure crap. DOnt come to me saying that this is a great portrai of the  lost generation, bl, bl, bl. There is no plot at all, the character are  ridiculous, the narrative style makes one want to kill the writer.
