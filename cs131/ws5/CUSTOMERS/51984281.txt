UGH, it really kills me to write a bad Irving review, as I've read all the others and considered myself a huge fan.  As the saying goes, \\"can't be on top of your game forever\\".

Can you think of a more wonderful place to have had the pleasure of reading this book than in the northwestern mountains of Maine?!  Yes I did!  I spend a week every summer at just such a place as the fishing camp described in this gorgeous novel (I can't help but wonder if maybe it's one and the same!?).

We get an intimate view of just how devastated a family can be by such a terrible disease.  Sixteen year old Kate has leukemia and her younger sister, Anna, who was basically created to be a donor for her sister, has reached the tender age of 13 and is sick of feeling like she may as well be sick herself given all the time she is spending in the hospital donating parts of her body to  Kate.  Enter Jesse, the angry older brother who is dealing with the hurt he feels inside by &quot;acting out&quot; as a juvenile delinquent.  We feel such sympathy for Sara and Brian as they try to hold onto their sick daughter with such fierce devotion, possibly, to the detriment of their other children.  <br />Ms. Picoult does a wonderful job bringing the reader into the heart of this struggling family.  I felt such empathy for all of them and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I recommend it highly.	2004-05-28

I am a great fan of Anne Tyler since the late 80's, I devoured all of her books and hold onto them to re-read if the urge grabs me!  I just lover her style.  I hate very much to say that I felt a bit disappointed with this one.  After scanning the many reviews here I see that I am not alone in my feelings.  It seems that quite a few true blue Tyler fans felt let down with this book.  I guess it's inevitable, it happens with many great writers and artists, how can one expect them to keep topping the last effort, sooner or later one is bound to be disappointed, I just hope that it's a bump in the road and that her next one blows my socks off like her earlier books.  I'd have to say that Ladder of Years was one of my faves, as well as Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, and of course The Accidental Tourist.  What I would love to see is more films being made of her stories. . . what is hollywood waiting for anyway?  So, in closing, please don't give up on this wonderful author, she is a marvelous talent and I don't doubt that she has another few gems left within her imagination!  I did not dislike this book, I just can't say it was one of her best, and that pains me to say.	2004-03-25

Look at how successfully it worked with &quot;To Die For&quot;?  I will look forward to this happening in the future!  The Usual Rules is perhaps the most touching story told by a young girl that I've read since my Judy Blume days!  Reading this book brought me back to that age and it was irresistibly wonderful!

This was my first time reading Scott Spencer, but it won't be my last.  Some of the sentences in this book moved me deeply. . . there's something very poetic about his writing and I really enjoyed this book.  I agree with one of the reviews that there was a definite contemporary feel to this book.  The topic of adultery in contemporary fiction is certainly nothing new, but there is something different about the way Scott Spencer presents it.  His storytelling evokes real and sympathetic emotions.  The reader can be morally outraged yet still be able to empathize because the characters are human, we feel as if we know them.  I do have to admit the ending left me a bit unsatisfied, but there again, at least Mr. Spencer didn't wrap it all up in a nice package (even if part of me wanted him to).  He stuck to the true nature of the story, and I admire his talent.  I'm thinking of picking up a copy of &quot;Endless Love&quot; now that I've been introduced to this author, the movie may've &quot;hurt&quot; his reputation, but A Ship Made of Paper should redeem him as a talented writer!	2003-05-02

The characters are so real and the events of their lives so familiar. . . makes you think Ms. Wood must've not only written about it, but LIVED it! Her ability to create such an accurate portrait of this town and it's residents is truly remarkable.  She possesses an acute understanding of human nature and small town sensitivity.

Contrary to typical long-time Irving fan opinion, based on other reviews written here, I want to announce to everyone that I absolutely adored this one!

This was a very funny, touching story about a frustrated second-rate TV journalist longing to do some &quot;meaningful&quot; reporting.  Patrick Wallingford lost his left hand to a hungry lion while on assignment, beds down most every woman he meets and falls helplessly in love with the widow of the donor of his transplanted hand.  Sounds like typical Irving material, however, it is written in a style and manner not-so-typical of his previous novels; specifically, this is light and airy, easy-to-read, which is a nice break from the norm and not what I have come to expect from John Irving.  I found it to be refreshingly uncomplicated and such a clever, amusing story!  I applaud Mr. Irving's courage to break away from custom, as he has here, offering readers this charming pleasure.

With her uncanny ability to make us laugh and cry, we find ourselves doing both throughout this book.  Always a quiet loner, at 51 Myra lives quite an isolated yet satisfying enough existence, working as a visiting nurse, with her dog as her only companion.  As fate would have it, she finds herself nursing her old classmate Chip, the former heart-throb who is now terminally ill.  As she and Chip spend his last days together, they share some very tender moments described with the infinite grace we've come to expect from Ms. Berg.

Told in her lyrical fashion, Alice Hoffman brings us into the lives of Ethan and Jorie Ford as they spend an exquisite June in New England weekday morning making passionate love, then suddenly we feel utterly betrayed by the ugly accusations made against Ethan.  How could this have happened?  Immediately I felt shocked, and was completely drawn into the lives of these people I had only moments before been introduced to.  How does she make me feel so much so fast?  I have loved all of Ms. Hoffman's books.

I sympathized with his situation and was thoroughly caught up in the mystery of Rosa Littlefoot, who is sitting in jail for having killed her common-law husband and has entrusted the confused &quot;Doc&quot; with the care of her infant daughter.  Did she kill him?  What really happened on that night?  Will &quot;Doc&quot; get custody of Maria?  Such a tantalizing tale . . . kept me completely engrossed throughout!

Somehow over the next couple of reading sessions I started losing my enthusiasm for the story.  Ida was a pip indeed!  Kay was a bit pathetic but I still had hope for her.  Her father, Francis, was despicable, her husband Neal was an irritating, uninteresting whimp.  Thankfully, she had her friend Zabeth, who was an absolute hoot!  These characters were all so enjoyable at first, but as the story progressed it seemed to drag and become bland, I can't quite put my finger on it.  I do see great talent here and would like to read some of Ms. Giles' short stories.  Perhaps this book would've been better as a short story and there just wasn't enough material here to keep my interest peaked?!

For a father to completely shut down like that and refuse to see his daughter, I wanted to delve into his mind.  I've read several books by this author and have tremendous respect &amp; admiration for her talent.

What an amazing talent Mr. Dubus has to make me feel so strongly for both characters.  The story is extremely thought provoking, human error results in tragedy and it is all too real.  I felt really awful for the Colonel's wife, and thought it was interesting how I could sway between feeling sorry for Kathy and the Colonel, and then being so angry with them . . . my feelings were all over the place, which was a bit frustrating for me but to the authors credit this story aroused strong emotions.	2001-02-20

What a wonderful mother she would have been. . . you find  yourself feeling so sorry for her, her disappointments become your own.  I  will tell every single one of my reading friends to run out and buy this  book.  Congratulations Monica, and may you continue to amaze us with your  incredible talent!	2000-09-16

Mr. Reiken did not disappoint with this second novel,which I've eagerly  awaited since reading The Odd Sea and meeting him at a book reading/signing  appearance at my local library.  He has a real gift for characterization  and the reader cannot help but fall in love with Anthony and Juliette, as  well as the people in their lives.  I miss them already! The elements of  family-life are well depicted and one must wonder if Mr.Reiken has personal  experience with depression based on his perceptive creation of Jess Rubin,  Anthony's sad, broken-spirited mother.  I felt such empathy for her.  What  a wonderful new writer I've discovered in Frederick Reiken!	2000-09-04

Samantha holds her own while struggling to maintain a normal life  and provide a loving home for her son Travis in the midst of recovering  from having the rug pulled out from under her feet and figuring out where  to go from here.  These characters are so real it's amazing, what a talent  Ms. Berg has!  Samantha manages to make me laugh with her &quot;so very  real&quot; internal dialogue even as she is on the edge of utter despair. .  . I can't say enough good things about this writer!	2000-08-23

What most negative reviewers seem to have forgotten is the story takes place in early 1970's, and with that in mind, remains true to the times.  Ellen was  dealing with a terrible situation in the only way she knew how, and came  through courageous and self-respecting.  I cheered for Ellen as she toiled  through her daily drudgery never losing sight of who she was, being able to  see that greener pasture with all odds against her.  How sad that her own  family did not value her enough to see the misery she was dealing with, she  was truly a woman alone trying to escape a hellish existence for her  children's sake as well as her own.  So many women of that era did not have  the inner strength to fight and would've continued living in what can only  be described as a &quot;spirit-crushing environment&quot;.  A. Mannette  Ansay has written a winner!	2000-02-21

The story was a good one, the characters interesting enough to want to learn more about them.  However,  the story struck me as somewhat oddly disjointed, I'd find myself really  enjoying it and caught up in the character (i.e. the adventures of unhappy  Dorothy Lockhardt), only to be abruptly thrown into an unconvincing tale of  Marcy's hiatus in an unbelievably portrayed Los Angeles.  Overall, the  story was a good one and I would recommend it.  Tom McNeal shows terrific  promise and I look forward to his next effort.	1999-12-04

I rooted for her all the way through the story...she felt like a sister.  Elizabeth Berg possesses an unequaled talent for bringing the reader into the lives of her  characters.  I'm surprised &amp; saddened by the disappointing reviews I've  read here.  This book is an absolute treasure!	1999-08-14

Melissa Bank's is a fresh, bright, humorous and engaging new voice and I  hope to be reading more from her soon.  She accurately captures the spirit  of women in the dating scene and tells a story with much humor and insight.   Take this one to the beach this summer, you'll love it!!	1999-06-18
