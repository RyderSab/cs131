It grabbed me really hard and made me realize<br />the complexity and wonder of chemistry (something I hadn't experienced with freshman chem.)  If you are a chemistry major, this is definitely the book you will want to use.  If your prof is using a different text, I'd definitely keep a copy of this one to use as a second opinion, at least.  It is extremely well-written and it's written at a high level.  In other words, it<br />doesn't just string you along and give you the basics...<br />it delves deeply into reaction mechanisms and what is<br />actually happening in each reaction.  Product yields for<br />many reactions are included, and this is quite useful.<br />The writing style makes you learn a new way of thinking - that of a scientist.  At times, the syntax is a little \\"brainy\\"<br />(they refer to acetone by its IUPAC name, \\"propanone\\",<br />for instance, and they refer to ethylene oxide as \\"oxacyclopropane\\".)  I had an earlier version of this book in class when I took organic many years ago, but the revisions are mostly in presentation and in the problem sets.  True, the problems in each chapter are not always good.  If your instructor is good, they will provide their own problems to supplement the book's.  But my suggestion is to go ahead and just do a web search for old exams and problems given by profs at other schools.  Many of these are great and will give you tons of insight.  For those who have already graduated, this is a good and up-to-date book to keep with you in your graduate studies or in the lab if you work in such a capacity.	2005-07-20

These days, bios of Hollywood personalities are usually laden with sordid details of typical stardom - sudden success, decline into alcoholism, divorce, more alcoholism, giving birth to kids who get into drugs, 12-step program, and BOOM!  Now the celebrity is happy at age 65.  Unfortunately, Albert Salmi wasn't able to complete his journey...but what a life this guy had.  And a happy one at that.  Anecdotes from Hollywood actors, plus a great many excerpts from Salmi's unpublished memoirs, are splendid.  I hope Ms. Grabman writes many more books.	2005-07-07

The commentaries are really really good too.  Many of the scripts have dialogue in them that wasn't in the actual TZ episodes, and some of the character names are different.  As a lifelong TZ fan, it's nice to find out those things.<br />I bought the set of both volumes.  They are mainly catered to TV geeks and historians like myself.  I have read the TZ Companion for a long time but of course that isn't a TV script book, it's a reference book.  These Gems books are similar to the TZ Companion in terms of the commentaries, only they have the scripts too.  The back cover says that there are some TZ scripts that haven't been printed yet but I hope the rest will be in the future.	2005-07-06

This set is actually pretty good.<br />&quot;The Passersby&quot; - starring Morgan Brittany (supermodel and she also appeared as Katherine Wentworth on &quot;Dallas&quot;, as well as tons of staple shows from the sixties).  Morgan does a credible job here.  She gives it a good effort and it pays off.  Her Southern accent is sweet and convincing.  Where this one falls down is the use of a bland supporting cast.  The role of The Seargent was masterfully played by James Gregory in the original but the person playing it here clearly doesn't have much.<br />Stacy Keach, for some reason, pops in to play Abraham Lincoln at the end before delivering the closing narration.  The casting of Keach as host still remains a mystery to me...give me Rod Serling any day.<br />&quot;The Rip Van Winkle Caper&quot; - starring Tim Kazurinsky.<br />Kazurinsky gives the main character, Mr. Farwell, an English accent, which is a nice touch.  Also laudable are some great sound effects and the addition of a train heist (which is only referred to in the original).<br />&quot;Four O'Clock&quot; - starring Stan Freberg.  Freberg has a good time playing the part, much as Theodore Bikel did in the original.<br />However, the story itself was one of Serling's paler attempts.<br />In fact, it was adapted from a short story that itself is rather brief and unimaginative.<br /><br />&quot;The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street&quot; - starring Frank John Hughes.  You have to listen closely for Hughes' part...there are four other male neighbors who are equally vocal in the Maple Street skurmish.  The supporting cast are very good...perhaps better than the actors in the original version.  Just my opinion, but I always felt that the TV version was a little too pretentious, much like &quot;The Shelter&quot;.  Good sound effects here as well, especially at the end where the 'monsters' make their appearance.	2003-07-07

Let's just say that this set was not worth the [money]<br />I paid for it. Why listen to them if you can go watch<br />the originals on DVD or VHS? The radio versions are<br />pretty much nothing different from the originals, except<br />for a small amount of added dialogue here and there plus<br />some added sound effects. While listening to them, all<br />I could think about was how they were different from the originals. You can't top perfection, and that's what the TV series was. I ask, what's the point of doing them on radio??<br />\\"I Am the Night, Color Me Black\\" - in the original version starring Michael Constantine, Ivan Dixon, Terry Becker, George Lindsey, and Paul Fix, the actors make a rather mediocre story about a bunch of small-town rednecks who get their jollies by watching a man being hung. In the radio version, it sounds like the actors are all reading off of idiot cards. John \\"Cliff Claven\\" Ratzenberger sounds like he's bored to death and counting the minutes until he gets his paycheck.<br />\\"Escape Clause\\" - David Wayne is PERFECT in the original by Serling. Not the most imaginative of stories, and not the most Twilight Zone-ish, but Wayne makes the story ten times better than it is. In the radio version, Mike Starr puts us all to sleep.<br />\\"A Stop of Willoughby\\" - One of the best of the original series, and one of Rod Serling's best...it was a story about Rod himself, wanting to escape the pressures of the world. The radio version has some good sound effects for the sequences on the train, and the added bonus that Gart Williams (the main character) meets a girl onboard, one who's much better for him than his shrewish current wife.<br />\\"Cavender is Coming\\" - the original version with Carol Burnett was a mistake...Serling at his very worst. The radio version tries to [improve it], and it doesn't work. Movie theaters don't have usherettes anymore. The guardian angel gimmick works in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and a select small number of other films.<br />Hopefully future series' will be better.

Released just a few years before Lucy died and<br />months before Desi died, the last few years of<br />Lucy's life aren't covered.<br />The tone is fairly despondent, and until reading<br />the bio, I never knew just how rough things<br />got for Lucy after she and Desi started up<br />their show in 1951. Their marriage was<br />clearly a match made in hell. Luckily Lucy<br />was able to go on and do a few other successful<br />projects over the years, despite her unstable<br />health and the incredible volume of stress<br />she endured.<br />One particularly nice chapter in the book is the<br />one that describes the purchase of RKO studios (which<br />would become Desilu Studios), putting nearly all their good fortune<br />on the line.  This turned out to be a great<br />investment, but it was not without its problems-<br />it was the last big business deal made during<br />their marriage.  During the course of the deal,<br />they were rehearsing the episode of \\"The Lucy Desi Comedy<br />Hour\\" with Tallulah Bankhead.  Tallulah, being<br />her temperamental, melodramatic self, was<br />breaking nearly every rule in the book.  She<br />was unpunctual, flubbed lines, drunk constantly, cursed out<br />the director and Lucy on the set.  Desi<br />made the deal, only to come back to the<br />set and plunge headlong into another violent<br />fight with their guest star.  Luckily, on the<br />night the show was shot in front of the<br />audience, Tallulah was flawless.<br />This book is a good supplement to the \\"Love, Lucy\\"<br />autobiography resurrected by Lucie Arnaz.

It covers just about all<br />(or seemingly so) of her early years in Texas,<br />her move to California, and at age 21, her move<br />to New York where she hit the 'big time'.<br />Carol obviously didn't have it easy.  Her family<br />was impoverished and her mother and father were<br />absentee parents.  Only because of her grandmother,<br />Nanny, did Carol pull through.  Although neither<br />of Carol's parents survived to see her success,<br />Nanny did...and for that I'm sure she'll eternally<br />be grateful.<br />Unbeknownst to me before reading the book, her mother had<br />an illegitimate baby girl, Chrissy, which she kept...and this<br />was back in the 40's when such things were<br />scorned mercilessly.  Luckily, just before<br />her mother died prematurely, Carol was able to take Chrissy<br />back to New York where she finished her formative years.<br />The coverage stops all too soon...Carol's narrative<br />is especially inviting.  I was hoping that a few<br />bits about &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and Harvey, Tim,<br />Vicki, and Lyle would be included, but it's easy<br />to see why that element was left out.<br />Although the structure doesn't really take the<br />form of a letter, the book claims to be a  letter<br />written for her three daughters.  A unique format.<br />My only complaint is that the book contains tens of<br />pages of Carol's handwritten letters to a guy<br />named DeNootie (an old friend of hers).  In the paperback<br />version, they are impossible to read because the<br />print is overpixelated.  Ditto for the section of<br />photographs...the photos are all way underexposed.<br />A must-read for any Carol fan.  Definitely among<br />the best bios I've ever read or will read.	2003-03-19

The first story, &quot;Map of the World&quot;, is about a young black woman kidnapped by two thugs who pour gasoline on her and<br />set her afire.  The title couldn't be a better one for the story,<br />but you'll have to read it to find out why.<br />Perhaps the most moving of the five pieces, &quot;Margins&quot;, is about a young boy named Julian who stops talking and as a result, gets sent away to military boarding school by his boozing, caterwauling, abusive parents.  It takes the form of a letter written by Julian to his sister.  In it,<br />he recalls about the old &quot;Choose your own adventure&quot;<br />books they used to read as young kids...and thus, he<br />reveals that life is literally just such an adventure.  He recalls the time they used to spend together at the local cemetary, sitting quietly under the trees sharing a cigarette between them, then venting frustration as they kick over headstones.  Eventually, Julian comes full circle finds nirvana after committing suicide and joining the ranks of the entombed.<br />Also worth mentioning is the final story, &quot;Whisper&quot;,<br />about a young girl whose father is guilty of the<br />incest taboo.  Although she's able to put it<br />behind her and live a 'normal' life, no matter<br />how many hours in analysis she spends, the reality is<br />that it will never completely leave her.  Only<br />after her father is dead and gone does she realize<br />he was the only man she's ever loved.<br />Each of the stories is wrought with a harsh, barren<br />quality and the word choice and core-of-the-note<br />detail is amazing.  Conlon's characters are literally<br />so real you can touch them.  Here and there are small spellbinding moments that are unforgettable.<br />And it is without a doubt that the characters of this group of &quot;Secrets&quot; are living out these same dramas every single day,<br />in some similar form or another.<br />This is a book that will make you step back a few paces.<br />Writing like this makes us appreciate what we've<br />got, however much or little.  Foreword and afterword<br />by acclaimed writers William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson (who co-authored the stories/screenplays &quot;Logan's Run&quot;<br />and &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot;) are excellent forerunning/<br />postrunning comments.

And why<br />Twilight Zone to make the regression?' Well, the producers<br />of the series obviously saw no problem with it...they<br />pay CBS their fees, get the product on the shelves,<br />and collect the cash from the sales.<br />This is, unfortunately, another example of an<br />over-commercialised, slapdash attempt to revive<br />and sequelize a classic masterwork....sort of like<br />taking Shakespeare and cutting out all the middle-English<br />so everyone on the planet can understand it in \\"plain\\"<br />English. Bad example...and call me a mindless dolt<br />for using it. But that's exactly what's happening<br />with these Twilight Zone radio dramas.<br />The producers hooked Dennis Etchison, an excellent<br />writer, to expand and water-down the great old stories<br />of Rod Serling (and yes, the stories of Richard Matheson,<br />Chuck Beaumont, and other writers are going to be<br />adapted for radio as well, sans a few segments<br />that don't work well on radio including Matheson's<br />near-silent \\"The Invaders\\" and Serling's highly visual<br />\\"Eye of the Beholder\\"). Sadly, it is all too apparent<br />that Etchison knows, deep down, that the work of<br />the old writers can't be topped. For a show like<br />\\"The Twilight Zone\\", whose domain was almost like<br />a world parallel to our own, with the entire universe<br />as its breeding ground,<br />to take its stories and bring them back to the mundane and the reality-grounded<br />as radio programs is pointless.  These first two sets<br />really come off as no more than bland recitations of<br />old stories that fans know inside and out from the<br />original TV versions.<br />The actors for the first series of eight dramas<br />include Jim Caviezel, Lou Diamond Phillips, Tim<br />Kazurinsky, Jane Seymour, James Keach, Blair Underwood,<br />Kim Fields, Chris MacDonald, and Ed Begley Jr.<br />Of these, only Jane Seymour does a credible job<br />as star of Serling's episode \\"The Lateness of the Hour\\"<br />(which originally starred the late Inger Stevens).<br />Tim Kazurinsky and Lou Diamond Phillips do earn<br />their paychecks with fairly humorous performances<br />in episodes \\"Mr. Dingle the Strong\\" (originally<br />starring Burgess Meredith) and \\"A Kind of Stopwatch\\",<br />respectively. The rest of the actors quite obviously<br />have no clue as to what they were doing, reciting<br />all their lines as if read directly from a cue card<br />(which in fact is probably what they did!)<br />In the role of ersatz-Rod Serling, the narrator,<br />Stacy Keach pretty much mails in his performance.<br />His readings of the intro/closings are but<br />lacking the gripping sincerity and meaning that<br />Rod always imparted to each and every narration.<br />Further hampering the dramas is the inclusion<br />of sponsor commercials, which pop up several<br />times.

And why<br />Twilight Zone to make the regression?' Well, the producers<br />of the series obviously saw no problem with it...they<br />pay CBS their fees, get the product on the shelves,<br />and collect the cash from the sales.<br />This is, unfortunately, another example of an<br />over-commercialised, slapdash attempt to sequelize a classic masterwork.  If the effort is an attempt to make \\"Twilight<br />Zone\\" accessible to the younger generation, there's no need...you can go pop in a tape or DVD and watch the original<br />episodes.  But this seems to be a case of taking Shakespeare<br />and cutting out all the middle English, in attempt to make the plays more universal.<br /><br />The producers hooked Dennis Etchison, an otherwise superlative<br /><br />writer, to \\"expand\\" the great old stories<br />of Rod Serling (and yes, the stories of Richard Matheson,<br />Chuck Beaumont, and other writers are going to be<br />adapted for radio as well, sans a few segments<br />that don't work well on radio including Matheson's<br />near-silent \\"The Invaders\\" and Serling's highly visual<br />\\"Eye of the Beholder\\"). Sadly, it is all too apparent<br />that Etchison knows, deep down, that the work of<br />the old writers can't be topped. For a show like<br />\\"The Twilight Zone\\", whose domain was almost like<br />a world parallel to our own, with the entire universe<br />as its breeding ground,<br />to take its stories and bring them back to the mundane and the reality-grounded<br />as radio programs is pointless. These first two sets<br />really come off as no more than bland recitations of<br />old stories that fans know inside and out from the<br />original TV versions.<br />The actors for the first series of eight dramas<br />include Jim Caviezel, Lou Diamond Phillips, Tim<br />Kazurinsky, Jane Seymour, James Keach, Blair Underwood,<br />Kim Fields, Chris MacDonald, and Ed Begley Jr.<br />Of these, only Jane Seymour does a credible job<br />as star of Serling's episode \\"The Lateness of the Hour\\"<br />(which originally starred the late Inger Stevens).<br />Tim Kazurinsky and Lou Diamond Phillips do earn<br />their paychecks with fairly humorous performances<br />in episodes \\"Mr. Dingle the Strong\\" (originally<br />starring Burgess Meredith) and \\"A Kind of Stopwatch\\",<br />respectively. The rest of the actors quite obviously<br />have no clue as to what they were doing, reciting<br />all their lines as if read directly from a cue card<br />(which in fact is probably what they did!)<br />In the role of ersatz-Rod Serling, the narrator,<br />Stacy Keach pretty much mails in his performance.<br />His readings of the intro/closings are but<br />lacking the gripping sincerity and meaning that<br />Rod always imparted to each and every narration.<br />Further hampering the dramas is the inclusion<br />of sponsor commercials, which pop up several<br />times. The CD versions are all one continuous<br />42-minute track with no option of fast-forwarding<br />through the commercials unless done manually.<br />In short, this new radio series does not yet offer<br />anything that the original series didn't. The<br />days of good ol' radio are gone, never to return.<br />But there are many more of these dramas still yet to<br />be released. Collections 3 and 4 have already<br />been released and do offer some nice sound<br />effects and a fabulous performance by Morgan<br />Brittany in episode \\"The Passersby\\".

As has been mentioned, Earl Hamner was among the forgotten writers of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" (Montgomery Pittman, Hamner, Jerry Sohl, plus a handful of others who wrote only one or two segments). His contribution to the series numbers only eight episodes, but two of these are surely among the most memorable in the entire series (\\"Jess-Belle\\", \\"Stopover in a Quiet Town\\").<br />At this juncture, three other volumes of \\"Twilight Zone\\"<br />scripts are available to us, including those of Richard<br />Matheson and George Clayton Johnson. Rod Serling's scripts<br />have not as yet been published, nor have those of<br />Charles Beaumont. The two \\"Twilight Zone Scripts\\" volumes containing the scripts of Matheson, released in 2001 and 2002, as well as the \\"Twilight Zone Scripts and Stories\\" of Johnson were somewhat of a disappointment. Not the scripts themselves, but the way in which they were presented.<br />Those of Matheson were edited (if you can call it that)<br />by Stanley Wiater. But really, Wiater did little more than re-state what has already been said elsewhere about Matheson's<br />episodes. Here and there, a new tidbit from Matheson himself is added into the commentary, nothing too special. No interviews with actors from Matheson's episodes were done,<br />nor is there any special insight into the material. Johnson's<br />volume (now out of print) is welcome, but slim and altogether lacking commentary.<br />So, it is with \\"The Twilight Zone Scripts of Hamner\\" that we get what we were after. The scripts are preceded by thoughtful, thorough, and occasionally critical commentary by Albarella that matches or surpasses the level of Marc Zicree's in \\"The Twilight Zone Companion\\". Albarella obviously went to great lengths to get anecdotes from stars of Hamner episodes including such luminaries whose voices we don't hear often: Anne Francis, James Best, Barry Morse, plus lesser-known actors Nancy Malone, Kevin Hagen, and Michael Forest. Of course, background as to the genesis of each story is detailed with comments from Hamner himself. The commentaries are welcome in more ways than one; after all, haven't fans been reading and taking to heart the critiques of \\"The Companion\\" for the last 21 years? Time for some new blood in the pool.<br />Also included is a section of production and publicity photos from each episode, as well as recent shots taken in 2002 at the \\"Stars of the Zone\\" Convention (the first convention<br />for \\"Twilight Zone\\") of several actors appearing in Hamner's episodes. Unfortunately the quality of many of these shots is only marginal.<br />As the ardent fan of the original series knows, Hamner occupied an oddly interesting place amongst the core of writers from the series. Serling focused on bespectacled bank clerks and high-paid businessmen suffering from ulcers who craved serenity in another time period. Matheson usually focused on realism and the writing is often extremely despondent and horrific. Beaumont gave us the extraordinary. Hamner's 'dissertation for Twilight Zone' compares and contrasts country folk (\\"The Hunt\\", \\"Jess-Belle\\") with city folk (\\"You Drive\\", \\"Stopover in a Quiet Town\\", \\"Black Leather Jackets\\", \\"The Bewitchin' Pool\\"). Two fantasy stories, \\"Ring a Ding Girl\\"  and \\"A Piano in the House\\"  round things out nicely.  Needless to say, the eight shows by Hamner generate a great deal of interest,<br />if for no other reason that they examine a number of interesting<br />ideas.

Many people seem to criticize this book - on Amazon and off Amazon.  Those who call it &#34;vengeful&#34;, &#34;spiteful&#34;, or any number of critical adjectives, clearly do not understand the relationship that Agus had with Heifetz, who was one of the several greatest musicians who ever lived, or who ever will live.  Heifetz was not a happy person for most of his life.  He was enormously successful, but with that success came great responsibility.  The kind of life he led made him an enormously difficult person who often resorted to crazy, illogical things.  Much of this, the author observed on a daily basis.  Those expecting a feel-good type book about Heifetz or his life are never going to find one, because there will never be one.<br /><br />Personally, I found this book fascinating because although Heifetz is not even in my top five favorite fiddlers, I have always liked listening to his recordings simply for the fact that his playing is so accurate.  So, learning more about him was a 'must'.  Those of us who know the violin repertoire and have heard it performed by others often &#34;defer&#34; or &#34;refer&#34; to Heifetz's recordings as benchmarks.  True, he did not play everything well, and he openly admitted that he was not good at Bach and that he found it and Mozart very difficult.  There were certain compositions that he never played in public or recorded - he had perfect technique but he openly admitted that he never felt it was so perfect that he could play anything, or play everything equally well.  There were a lot of works for the violin that he never played, particularly 20th century works (Stravinsky, Bartok, Shostakovich, Barber, just to name several).<br /><br />Agus' work takes us through the autumn of Heifetz's time on Earth.  There were many ups and many downs, not all of which were discussed (his bitter relations with his second wife and other family, and his financial problems, were wisely not discussed.)  What is clear, despite Heifetz's oft-odd behavior, is that he had things that kept him very active in old age, and things that satisfied him after he had retired from concertizing.  He still played the violin every day, despite having a non-functioning right shoulder.  He finished off work of his 130-something violin-piano transcriptions.  He continued teaching his master class until just a few years before he died.  He was not the greatest teacher and as practically all of his students have attested, he would not usually demonstrate on his his own violin unless a student was really not understanding what he was saying.  Most of his students were already very advanced by the time they came to his class but he helped them become even better performers, and not just musically, which is why some people were dismissed after only a short time with him.  Although never one to socialize much, he made a kind of family out of a very few trusted friends and students, and he loved to be the one to host a holiday party, and he rolled out the red carpet for these occasions.<br /><br />As Heifetz, told the author, &#34;Be sure you put all of this down in the book you are going to write after I am dead and gone.&#34;  And, she did...she put everything and even more into it.  Yes, some of it is quite harrowing (the chapter detailing the long car trip to Malibu - I won't give it away but it's nothing short of amazing), and a certain portion of it is rather depressing - particularly the section that discusses the final years of his teaching career at USC.  By then, senior management at the university had changed, and they had other ideas about what they wanted in their music program.  The early chapters, discussing the author's life and how she came into acquaintence with The Great Master are a good intro to what follows.<br /><br />I recommend this book - but not to everyone, and even to those I recommend it to, I suggest that you either take it with a grain of salt and/or be prepared to read some things that might otherwise make you say to yourself &#34;jeez, this is all so depressing!&#34;  I'd say this book has a very limited audience - I first read it when I was in college, not too many years after it was published.  I will admit, I did not like it too much at first but as the years have gone by, I have come to enjoy and appreciate it more.  The discussion of many pieces of music, for those who *really* know the violin repertoire, and Mr. Heifetz's contributions to it, is very informative and welcome.

The authors discuss the material in such a way that unless you spend all your time reading their book, you won't ever get it. I spent way too much time over a full academic year trying to figure out what the book meant. And when I worked the problems, I often times didn't understand the material well enough to even begin to know how to approach them. The problems in this book are usually set up so that you have to derive your own equations *based on* the equations the authors discuss. The authors take a very loopy, confusing approach to thermodynamics (I had to try to forget a lot of the stuff I learned from this book when I took Physical Chemistry courses). Further, the chapters on thermo are not nearly complete enough, and the analogies used are usually bad. This book covers all the basic topics, like any other standard physics text, but the level of discussion is just slightly too advanced for the John Doe taking a General Calculus-based Physics class, whose only background is high school physics.<br />Look into some other textbooks...I hear Serway's book is<br />good.	2000-07-19

I had this book for three terms of calculus, and it was a headache. For every one person who liked the book, there were fifty who didn't.  The authors, in trying to take a &quot;leaner, more conceptual approach&quot;  to calculus, thoroughly confuse. The chapters on series and sequences are  impossible to understand, and no practical problems are included in them.  A good textbook supplements the material presented in lecture, and this one  certainly did not. To summarize: this book presents calculus in a way that  makes it seem far, far more complicated than it really is.  And, to top it  off, this is an *experimental* textbook that has been around for years.  Time to conclude the experiment; it failed!	2000-07-15

It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from.

Also, there is  no solutions manual and the problems Manahan gives are challening (a  section of numerical solutions placed in the back of the text would have  been nice...)

I learned a lot by working the problems.  I did not, however, learn how to do more than simple proofs. Instead of outlining some methods as to how beginning students  should go about learning how to prove theorems, the author assumes you  already know how to do that. Consequently, I didn't master that skill. It  also would have helped if the Solutions Manual that accompanies this text  were available to students; maybe by now  they've made it available.  Leon  definitely does not include enough worked examples in the text, and those  problems where &quot;The Proof is left as an exercise for the reader&quot;  are useless and defeating. I wholeheartedly disagree with the review above  that &quot;if you can't handle this text, don't major in math, you don't  have what it takes&quot;.  Nonsense.  Provided you give it your all, you  can major in math, and understand Leon's text, even if you aren't blessed  with sheer, infallible intellect.	2000-06-19

A good text supplements the course lectures, and this one *certainly* did not. Also, check out their references sections at the end of each chapter...many of them are from *old* sources!  Also, many of the graphs and diagrams in the book were prepared on old, rattletrap software packages.  Well, no wonder, in the Preface they say that their book had been written over the last 83 years! Time to ditch this textbook and go for a fresher approach.  Atkins' PChem text<br />is better, I hear...maybe the revised version that came<br />out in 2000 is better.  The one bit of kudos I can give<br />to this book is that there are some good end-of-chapter<br />problems.	2000-06-16
US	51258913	R2OMSQSBX87PVW	0139186735	217064981	General Chemistry: An Integrated Approach (2nd Edition)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Excellent Intro Text	This text was used in 1999-2000 at Oregon State University for the 100-level General Chem sequence for non-science majors.  It is an excellent text with a (generally) friendly approach to introductory topics, and there  are many nice photographs and discussion boxes containing info about  practical chem applications.  For some reason, the authors include a  significant section on organic chemistry in chapter 2, far before they  discuss bonding....  Other than that, this book is great.  Better than four  out of five other general chem texts.	2000-06-16

This is an excellent reference book, but a poor text for students learning about inorganic for the first time.  The discussion (Chapter 4) on molecular symmetry and point groups is INSANE.  The prof who taught the  course provided a number of supplementary materials on point groups,  probably because this chapter is so flawed.  The second part of the text is  somewhat better than the first...  Personally, I learned a lot from the  discussions in the Guide to Solutions manual that accompanies the text; if  I hadn't had that, I'd have definitely received a lower grade in the class.  Overall, an average-level textbook.	2000-06-16

Certainly there's a lot in Zicree's work. Quotations from interviews with many cast members and Buck Houghton (producer of the first three seasons) are included, perhaps the best feature of the book. He gives decent analyses to perhaps 30 per cent of the episodes, but the remainder are slapdash and filled with often rash-sounding, often objectionable statements. Examples: he rattles off a forgettable three sentences for his review of &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; (a mediocre episode, but certainly more could be said) and yet he devotes nearly five pages to &quot;Nothing in the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Bard&quot; (average episodes at best). More photographs should defintely have been included...the ones included are often small stills from the episodes.  A few nice ones are included but for such a visual series as TZ, this book needs more pics. Even more cast interviews would have been nice, as well. I'd never call this a seriously flawed effort. It coulda been far, far better, though.	2000-06-12

This book is outstanding, to say the least.  The authors show mechanisms clearly and discuss synthesis in a way that gets you thinking  like an organic chemist.  This textbook sorta changed my life; it taught me  how to think like a scientist.  Definitely *THE* book for undergrad Organic  courses, and an excellent reference book that should remain in the lab at  all times.	2000-04-25
