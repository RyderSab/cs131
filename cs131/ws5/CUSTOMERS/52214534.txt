This book is mostly about a brother and a sister whose dog disappears, while still a puppy.  They spend most of the book wondering who took their dog and looking for their dog.<br />I had a hard time with the clues that they over-looked, as they were supposed to be intelligent children!<br />Other than that, it was an enjoyable read.  There is a tiny amount of religion in the book, and the little girl prays to god for the dog to come home.  Going to church is viewed positively by the author.  As an agnostic, it bothered me a little.  Just a little.<br />I read the book aloud to my 7 and 10 and they both enjoyed the story much more than I did.	2004-04-17

I caught myself thinking again and again \\"no one would do that\\" Yet; the book was filled with seemingly real meanness and danger. I can't think of an appropriate age for this book because no one over 9 would find it believable and the creepiness is way too creepy for anyone under 12 in my opinion.	2004-04-01

It is obviously for a younger child - not to age 8, in my opinion.  Although, I can't see that my son would have ever been thrilled with it, because the pictures are not very colorful.<BR>There isn't much of a story here, just mostly lists of creatures that you are supposed to locate on the pages...my son wasn't interested in having the story read to him a second time.<BR>I gave this story 3 stars for a child under 6...1 star for an older child.	2003-12-18

At one point in the story, the uncle has the baby secretly taken from his brother and sister and threatens to drop the baby from a high tower.  It feels a little too real.<br />Although, this book has an enjoyable writing style, I would not recommend it for a child of nine.  It is far too negative and vividly written.

Maybe it's because my mother was crazy, too...She was married and divorced 4 times. Did you know that dog poop turns white if no one cleans it up for a very long time?  I DO.  Because no one in my family saw it a THEIR responsibility to clean up.<br />Now that I am done with the book, my 17 year old son wants to read it.  I told him, \\"Okay, but I have to blacken out some parts...\\" (After all, he is my precious, sheltered, baby) Then I thought: C'mon, he is 17!  And so, I will let him read it, intact.  But, parts are sexually vivid and not in the healthiest way.<br />A few parts of the book made me laugh, but mostly, I just thought it was interesting and sad.  Certainly not boring.	2002-09-20

The author discusses children with problems exactly like my daughter, as well as other kinds of problems and the book is filled with many games to help.  I believe that my daughter will enjoy most of the many games in this book and I do believe that they will help her.  The book states that the most important thing is that children enjoy reading, so the games really are games.  I can't wait to get started today!	2001-11-25

This is story about hidden talents, not judging someone by their appearance etc. and it is very clever.  I especially liked the fact that the hero in this story is female.

It is about a slug who &quot;One summer Sunday while strolling on soil, with its antennae signaling, a slug sensed a slope.&quot;  The slope turns out to be something &quot;sinister&quot; and there is no happy ending here.  With a tender heart and used to happy endings, my little girl (7) was saddened by the ending and told me that she did not want me to read it to her the following night.  I told her that I would change the ending to &quot;and though the frog speedily slipped out it's slippery toungue, the slug somehow sneakily snuck away.&quot;  In the book, the slug isn't so lucky!  And I don't feel that the slug was smug at all, he was just going for a walk up a hill.	2001-11-19

It is filled with great pictures of bats and all kinds of bat facts.  It lets you know that bats are nothing to fear and even shows you how to make a bat house in the back of the book.  Did you know that bats are the only flying animals that nurse their young?  Bat &quot;pups&quot; hang together in large groups called nurseries and each mother returns at least twice during the night to feed her little pup.  Did you know that there is a bat in Australia that has a six foot wing span?  I didn't until I read this book...don't worry they eat fruit!

Most of the recipes are easy to follow and delicious, not fancy. favorites are the potato tofu salad (No one believes that it doesn't contain mayo!) tofu turnovers,EASY fried tofu,(put in a sandwich it tastes a lot like chicken)and Korean Barbeque Tofu - in this recipe I cook the tofu first, until it is tough and then I marinate it, not the other way around. The almond tofu is great as well.  If you want to eat more tofu and don't know how to fix it, this is the book for you.  There are dips and desserts too, but I haven't made many of those yet...just keep making my favorites over and over.	2001-01-13

It begins with a little horse introducing herself and then she spends the rest of the book saying &quot;I thought I heard a noise...I can hear it, but I can't see it...I guess it was nothing.  The End. I think that my 5 year old could have come up with a much better story.  And you learn nothing about horses in this story.

I think that this book would be most helpful to a young shy person, say college age or so, as opposed to someone my age (38) who's shyness is more of a habit. This is a pretty good book, but to expect it to bring more friends to you, or enhance your career is expecting too much.  It is an interesting book.	2000-10-25

I was raised in a somewhat religious household and then married into a very religious one. (Except my husband) In my mid-twenties, while trying to  raise two very young children and feeling very alone with my disbelief I  was thrilled to find this book!   It is only a slight exaggeration to say  that this book &quot;saved&quot; me. This book is well written and easy to  understand. Anyone who can read a news paper can read this book. Last week,  I loaned my 14 year old son my copy of Why I Am Not a Christian.  I doubt  that the book will be as meaningful to him as it was to me, because he has  been raised without Christian Mythology or any Mythology,  but I am sure  that he will get a lot out of it. This book states simply and clearly many  logical arguments against the existance of God and more importantly why  religion is immoral and harmful.  I recomend this book to anyone who is  even beginning to doubt.  Bertrand Russell will forever be my hero.	2000-06-06
