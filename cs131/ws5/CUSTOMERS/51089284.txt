That was when I discovered chimney swifts and have enjoyed them in our chinmeny every year.  I've been starved for details about these wonderful friends.  When I saw that Paul and Georgean Kyle had written a book I *knew* this would be the book to get.  They were the first people I found on the internet when I started researching chimney swifs. Because they also do chimney swift rehabilitation, they have been up close and personal with chimney swifts for years.  They really know their stuff.  They track the chimney swift arrivals across the county each spring, and they host the \\"chimney swift night out\\" each fall.  They are definitely the experts in my mind and this book is terrific.  Throughout the book there are amazing close-up photographs and wonderful drawings to accompany the text.  The writing is really enjoyable, like talking with a friend.  A very fun, easy, and extremely informative read.  I had a hard time putting the book down each night.  They cover topics like swift social behavior, courting, nesting, nest building, hatchling development, flight/maneuvers, roosting behavior, migration times and destinations, etc.  They also include excellent information on habitat and what we can do to help chimney swifts.  Their population has been declining since the 80s and we need to help.  There's info on building a chimney swift tower and more.  This is a wonderful book that will teach you all about the life and times of chimney swifts and give you ideas for helping them survive into the future.  Excellent book.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat and I'm so glad they wrote this book.  It has given me so much insight and understanding into what's going on in our chimney.  As I write this now, it's late April in Virginia and our swifts arrived just two weeks ago.  I can hear them chittering in the chimney, no doubt discussing where to put their nest :).	2005-04-30

Kyle and Georgean have put together \\"the book\\" on how to build a chimney swift tower. What I especially love about this book is that they provide a numb er of different designs - three different types of wooden towers as well as different types of masonry/cement block towers - so you have options.  There are pictures - photographs and drawings throughout to help with the building and the materials/instructions are very clear.  I haven't convinced my husband to build one (yet)and we already have swifts in our chimney but I am working with a local park and some eagles scouts to put one up.  Another thing I really like about this book is that it goes beyond just putting up a swift tower.  It also gives guidance on monitoring the tower (to include electronic monitoring like putting a camera inside) and report forms.  It also has great pictures so that at a park, for example, you can create an educational evironment as well.  Another neat thing is to also host a \\"swift night out\\" in the fall, where people gather to watch the swifts (babies all fledged and practicing their flight maneuvers)as they fly around the tower, dive in and more.  Its so amazing to see them flying at incredible speeds and then dive into the chimney or tower.  What a sight.  I've also ready that when the young are learning to fly, if one is having trouble, the adults will flying in circles below them, creating an updraft to help lift them higher.  They are such amazing birds, deserving of our attention and preservation.  This book really helps us not only provide a nesting site but also opportunities for our own education.....as the saying goes....we conserve what we love, we love what we understand, we understand what we are taught.	2005-04-30

It's a little more detailed that a typical field guide but what I like most about it is that its specific to our area.  So, while I have a larger field guide (for the region) I also really love having this one because it's more focused.  In the beginning of the book there's an introduction to habitat with great pictures showing what the habitats look like.  The book then goes into the specific species - I was particularly interested in the salamanders and amphibians but the sections on snakes, turtles and lizards are super too.  The pictures are great, descriptions cover approx. size, colors/patterns, species that they could be confused with, habitats, and egg laying (timing, incubation etc).  Great book to have on hand.	2005-02-20

In the winter time here in Virginia we get a number of differnt types of sparrows that migrate in.  I love watching them but was having difficulty determining which types were which from just the regular field guides so I asked around and one of our local birders recommended this to me.  Its terrific!  The pictures of the birds are close-up - as if you were holding the bird or were sitting on the ground less than a foot away looking at the bird.  This really helps when trying to distinguish the slight differences in colors or patterns.  Each species has a chapter that strats out with measurements (size, weight etc) then there's a range map, and some text on habitat, then some text on behavior and voice/songs.  There's writing about similar species, geographic variation, distribution (winter, breeding, migration periods), conservation status, and molt.  There's also text descriptions for specific markings etc to hone in on, and discussion of hybrids if any.  Then the chapter has pictures, of boys, girls, adults, juveniles, etc.  Really a great book that has helped me a lot.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.	2003-11-28

The instructions with it were very poor so I asked a local naturalist if she knew of any good bat books and specifically any that would indicate what frequency to tune the bat detector in to for our local bats.  She recommended this book and its terrific! There's a short section up front that talks about bats and how they echolocate as well as the frequencies that they do it at so this was perfect for me and my bat detector (boy is it cool!).  The real meat of the book is an id guide with great pictures and interesting information about each ofthe different species of bats - similar to a bird id book.  Since bats are genenerally out at dusk and they fly so fast I haven't been able to make use of the pictures and actually id the bats but I've narrowed it down by where we live and what we're likely to see so its fun to have a reference to read about them more specifically.  Excellent excellent book and a must have if you've just gotten a bat detector and need to know what frequency to tune into.  Highly recommended!	2003-11-27

The poem itself is fantastic - it just speaks to your inner most being, like a quiet friend asking you those life questions.  Each chapter is introduced by a stanza in the poem and then the chapter itself is Oriah talking about her experiences with that particular question or idea.  The writing style is simply wonderful, conversational, story style that just draws you in.  I bought this book on a whim having only seen the poem once on a postcard and I thought it was nice.  I had no idea how much the book and reading the stanzas in a slower way would touch me so much.  I was reading along, la di da, thinking really nice book, lots of good &quot;stuff&quot; to ponder, la di da, and then I got to chapter &quot;Hitting the Wall&quot;.  The stanza that goes with this chapter reads like this:  &quot;I have heard enough warrior stories of heoric dancing, Tell me how you crumble when yoy hit the wall, the place where you cannot go beyond by the strength of your own will.  What carries you to the other side of that wall, to the fragile beauty of your own humanness?&quot;  I've only &quot;hit the wall&quot; once before in my life - not to say that everything has been easy but I've always been able to see the glass half full and get on with things...until this one time. When I read these lines in the book it just touched me so much and her own stories that she provides throughout this book - they're just so honest and frank. There's a lot to think about in here.  I haven't read Invitation or her others yet but plan to check them out.  I've given this book away s gifts I liked it so much.  Definitely recommended to anyone just doing a little introspection, looking to live the dance.	2003-11-26

It has terrific drawings wit great colors for one thing but even more important is the great writing, which is easy to get into, and incredibly informative.  The level of detail is at the family level - e.g. &quot;woodpeckers&quot; or &quot;flycatchers&quot; But within the section, individual species are discussed.  The level of detail is perfect and subfamilies are addressed.  Foraging habits (with drawings in some cases) are discussed, habitat that the birds live in, variations in colors, breeding, vocalizations, the whole nine yards!  Its fantastic.  I started this review by mentioning the drawings because they really are the icing on the cake - an example is the face of a flycatcher drawn to show the bristles around its mouth.  Terrific!  I like the Stokes books on bird behavior too but this is one big complete reference!	2003-11-23

This is such a wonderful book.  There are not many pictures in here - just a hand drawn map in one part of the book.  Its excerpts from Thoreau's journal over the two year period when he lived on Walden's pond.  He did not live like a recluse (he went in to Concord almost every day) so its not a book about living alone per se.  Its more about reflecting on life, considering why one &quot;is&quot; and recognizing the beauty and mystery of nature around us every day, everywhere.  Thoreau talks of regular daily things too like what it costs him to farm, or having cider, or building a chimney.  The writing style is conversational, open, honest.  He doesn't try to get tricky with words, he just tells it like he sees it. It's so beautiful.  For anyone (like me) who indeed sees nature as their &quot;religion&quot; or sees the Great Spirit in every leaf, tree and bug, this book will be adored.  So many wonderful messages, thoughts, woven throughout this book.  Its an incredible work.	2003-11-22

I came across it after going through the National Wildlife Federation's Habitat Steward program (which was enlightening!).  This is an incredible book.  It covers all sorts of different habitats - each type of habitat is profiled (e.g. Sandy beach, salt marsh, lake and pond, river and stream, cattail marsh, sedge meadow, bog and bog forest, northern floodplain forest, southern floodplain forest, grassy field, transition forest, appalachian forest etc etc.)  In each ofthese chapters it talks about howthis particular habitat was formed, characteristic plants,  what types of wildlife you're likely to see there and why that habitat is beneficial to them, signs to look for to see if that wildlife has been there, and where to see that habitat.  There are great drawings and handdrawn tables throughout.  Its just packed with interesting facts - its hard to write a review of so much variety ind interesting info.  If you're looking for a book that will give you a great understanding and appeciation for the different types of habitat and how hte web of life weaves together then this book is a good one for you!  Highly recommended.  Lots to learn about from justthis one source.	2003-11-22

I came across this childrens book - its short, only about 48 pages and has pictures throughout.  Its a story of a boy who comes across a carpeter bee building a home in their barn wall - it really steps through all sorts of really interesting information about the bee and has drawings of what the nest looks like.  Written for kids but I enjoyed the book as a first step in learning about these fellow dwellers in our home.	2003-09-08

This book has so many insights - it really helped me get my arms around the situation - There are so many passages in here that I underlined because they just are so on target - one has to do with \\"accepting and enjoying and finding the value in my own path.  What was right for me.\\" The chapters in this book are as follows:  Becoming my own mentor  First Awakening  Awaken your habit-dulled spirit  The process of becoming  There is no tomorrow  Watch for signs of spring    wonderful quotes from other authors throughout the book as well.

Hawks can be tricky identifying so I use this book in tandem with The Photographic Guide to North American Raptors.  These two books together make a great set	2001-08-05

I've never had a garden book change me like this.  Its just so incredible. I ate up every chapter and couldn't put it down and when I was done I went out into the garden and got my hands dirty like never before.  This author completely breaks through the mysteries of gardening and basically shows us how we need to simply plant with nature (i.e. planting native plants, planting them where they will thrive) versus fighting against nature. She also wakes you up to the horrible ways that we are poisoning the early in this fight against nature by using pesticides and not realizing thhe impact.  Oh its just such an incredible book.  It more subtle than I'm making it sound and its not preachy at all. It just woke me up in such a way that I can't express enough how incredible this book is.  And by the way, by following the ideas expressed in the book we've got some fantastic gardens growing where birds and bees and butterflies all come to vist.  Its a wildloife adventure right in our back yard.  I've given this book as a gift to friends and relatives and they agreed with how incredible it is.  Her second book is ok, not as good as this one but still good	2001-08-05

It has all sorts of insects that you come across in your lawn/gardens/woods.  I use it constantly when i'm out looking at butterflies and get distracted looking at other insects.  Its great.  It breaks the insects down into those that you'll see in spring, summer, fall and winter.  It has reference tables on where to look for the insects (e.g. ponds, fields, ground, etc) and tells about their lifecycles.  Its just facinating.  You can learn a lot without being heavy into the science of orders and classes and things like that.  Really a great resource	2001-08-05

It goes into detail that is just enough for someone like me who doesn't have a science background but want to know more than tjust the basics.  Its got a lot of fun (and not so fun) facts that make you think and simply broaden your perspectives.  I'm glad I bought it	2001-08-05

I don't have a science background so I was hoping it wouldn't be too tough to read and its not. It has pictures and it goes through everything you'd like to know about spiders from how they weave webs to how the webs are structured to how they reproduce etc etc.  I was interested because I see all these beautiful webs in my gardens and I wanted to learn more about spiders.  This gave me justt the depth I was looking for without expecting me to have a pHd in the subject.  I really liked this book	2001-08-05

Its a real eye opener - with messages we all need to take with us.  We're so dependent on the pollinators yet their work is so transparent to us.  This book lays it all out.  Its quite timeless in both the message and the great info on different types of insects and animals.  You can learn a lot in this book on a lot of different levels	2001-08-05

How does thgis whole cycle continue.  Then I got on Amazon, did a search and came up with this book.  Its neat!  It tells you about different hibernation methods (for example some insects turn their body fluids into a sort of antifreeze!) It also tells about plants and how they cope.  Pretty interesting.	2001-08-05

I don't have a science background but I was looking for a book on bats with more detail than just the basics that all the books I had found up until this point provided.  This book is great!!!  Its technical yet understandable and it goes to a depth of info that the lay person who just wants to have a greater understanding for bats needs. <br />To give you an idea of some of the content, the chapters include:  evolution and diversity, flight (how the wings work, evolution of flight, demands on the bat), echolocation (how they make the sounds, how they avoid being confused by othre bats, using echolocation for navigation, use of echolocation in finding food), hibernation (facinating!!! how they stay warm, the cost of being in torpor state), reproduction &amp; development (great if you've got a bat house and wonder what's going on in there), roosting behavior, feeding, and the importance of bats/conservation.<br />I just think this is a great book.  I had so many questions about bats - the more I thought about them and wondered about them the more complex they became to me and this book really shed light on my questions.  Its terrific.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in going below the surface knowledge of what bats are and what they do and where they fit in the web of life.  They'e incredible.	2001-08-05

This is a must have book if you live in areas with swamps/bogs.  Its so accurate I'm just amazed.  It is also very easy to use.  It has drawings and it talks not only about id of the plants but also their &quot;lifestyle&quot; (e.g. how they reproduce, various ideosyncasies of the plants, insects that are associated etc.)  Each plant also has a short section on lore which adds a nice bit of history.  I really like the book	2001-08-05

I happpen to live with lots of thickets so this was very appropriate for us.  It has really good drawings of the plants and insects that you might encounter with some ofthem.  It talks about the different seasons and what the plants go through and what to look for.  It also has special tips for id and has a section on lore for each plant so you get stories too.  The swamp and bog book is layed out the same way and is also excellent.  They go further than the typical plant id book so you can really learn something	2001-08-05

I bought both Symonds' Shrub guide and Tree guide.  They are both terrific!  The Shrub guide has not only shrubs but also vines and ground covers.  It has plants that I've been wanting to be able to id for ages but  because the only book I had found until now were wild flower guides, I was  always at a loss.  This book is fantastic.  It has master plant pages a the  back so you can look at all the parts of the plants together (I use this  when i have an idea of what it might be already and just need to narrow it  down) or you can go to the parts sections in the front of the book and go  to &quot;leaves&quot; for example and search that way.  Its the best  approach I've seen and the pictures, although black and white - are  terrific.  They show great detail and actuall because they're b/w you're  not confused by variations in color.  Definitely one one my best books -  the one I go to first.	2000-07-24

Symonds' Tree Identification Book and his Shrub Identification Book are two fantastic guides.  They have load of pictures - even from different stages/ages of the plant/tree so you can more easily make the id.  The book  is segmented into sections like leaves, bark, flowers, etc so that whatever  part of the plant you have you can look it up that way.  Or, if you have  anidea what it might be you can go to the master pages in the back and see  the whole assortment of photos pertaining to that species in one place.   Its a fantastic reference that has really taken away a lot ofthe  frustration and guesswork for me.	2000-07-24
