As a skeptic, I'm well aware that the arguments in this book are lame.  But, to be slightly charitable, the book is about 20 years old, so I think it slightly unfair to judge it by modern standards. <br /> <br />When I first read it, back when it was new, I didn't know anything about skeptical arguments.  And so, at the time, I enjoyed the book.  The author intended this book to be \\"light\\" and it is.  And he has other books he intends to be scholarly (Evidence that Demands a Verdict) which really isn't, but gives the appearance of being so to the uninitiated.  So, for what the author intended it to do, at the time he wrote it, I think it fit what he intended.  It is of course complete garbage now, but I suppose for its era, I figure I should give it about 2 stars.	2005-08-01

The authors start out with some premises that they say just about everybody, even skeptics, agree with.  Well, a lot of us don't agree with them.  Anyway, the authors then try to build upon what they say \\"everybody\\" agrees with, in a house-of-cards fashion.  If this is true, then that must be true.  And if this, then that, etc.<br /><br />I'll give a very brief counter to each of the base premises:<br /><br />1) Jesus' death by crucifixion;<br /><br />Most skeptics have agreed to this, primarily because crucifixions did occur, so it wouldn't be terribly surprising if somebody names Jesus Christ was crucified.  But, beyond that, there isn't any reason to believe it.  There is NO contemporary reference to Jesus Christ in existence.  And, since the NT (Gospels, Epistles, etc.) were written at least (by conservative Christian standards) at least 20 years after his alleged death.  That means even including the Bible, there is still exactly 0 contemporary references.<br /><br />Skeptics can't really prove that somebody named Jesus Christ wasn't crucified, so most of accept that it happened.  But, then it becomes one of the pieces of the house of cards:  \\"Well, if Jesus *was* crucified, then...\\"  Well, no, I take that piece out and say no I don't accept it happened unless you can give me a non-propaganda contemporary reference for it.  You can't, so I reject claim 1.<br /><br />2) Jesus' disciples believed that he rose and appeared to them;<br /><br />The original ending of Mark has no appearances.  Therefore, it seems quite likely the earliest belief of Christians didn't have appearances.  Again, no contemporary non-propaganda reference to the alleged disciples believing any such thing exists.  I reject claim 2.<br /><br />3) Paul, a persecutor of the church, has suddenly changed to faith in Jesus;<br /><br />No contemporary non-propaganda reference to this exists.  Claim rejected.  Besides.  Even if it did happen, so what?  People change religions every day.  So what?<br /><br />4) James, skeptical of Jesus during his ministry, was suddenly changed to faith in Jesus; and,<br /><br />No contemporary non-propaganda reference exists.  Claim rejected.<br /><br />5) The tomb of Jesus was empty.<br /><br />No contemporary non-propaganda reference exists.  Claim rejected.<br /><br />All claims rejected. House of cards crumbles.happen, so what?  People change religions every day.

For its intended purpose, to lend a scientific air to Creationism for the Creationist-minded, it does a great job.  Dishonestly of course, but a great job.  In his introduction, Strobel has this to say:<br />\\"When I first began exploring these issues in the early 1980's, I found that there was sufficient amount of evidence to guide me to a confident conclusion. Much has changed since then, however.  Science is always pressing relentlessly forward, and a lot more data and many more discoveries have poured into the reservoir of scientific knowledge during the past twenty years.  All of which has prompted me to ask a new question:  does this deeper and richer pool of contemporary scientific research contradict or affirm the conclusions I reached so many years ago?  Put another way, in which direction-toward Darwin or God-is the current arrow of science pointing?\\"<br />He goes on to explain that his approach would be to cross-examine authorities, doctorate-level professors.  My, what an amazing coincidence that all the doctorate-level authorities that he picked happen to be Christian theists!  I expect that I am going to be misinterpreted as \\"bashing\\" his authorities simply by being Christian.  No, that's not the point.  Most Christians I know are fine people.  But, if you are really wanting to find out whether science confirms the \\"God theory\\", you don't only pick people that you know ahead of time are going to say \\"yes, Lee, that is exactly right.\\"  That's like saying, \\"I'm going to get to the bottom of this Buddhist stuff, I'm going to interview a bunch of Buddhist monks and see if they tell me that Buddhism is all its cracked up to be.\\"  I can tell that Strobel is smart enough to know this, so I can only conclude that his pretense of playing the skeptic is pure deception.<br />Similarly, while I agree that the people who Strobel interviewed have good credentials, they do hold minority opinions in their fields.  Again, I am not \\"bashing\\" his authorities simply for holding minority opinions-minority opinions can and do become majority opinions.  But again, if you are actually trying to do an investigation, you don't simply talk to people who hold minority opinions and ask them if their opinion is correct.  I find this more evidence of Strobel's pretense of playing the skeptic to be a complete farce.<br />For the rest of the book, Strobel basically asks the question, &quot;why is there something instead of nothing?&quot;  This is, indeed, the most imponderable of imponderables. The problem is, even if he is right that God made everything, God is still a &quot;SOMETHING&quot; and so you still are left with the question, &quot;why is there SOMETHING instead of nothing&quot;. He of course produced the usual answers about God needs no why, is eternal, etc. But that is just a dodge, you simply cannot answer why is there God instead of nothing. Ultimately, there just is no answer to the question, &quot;why is there something instead of nothing?&quot; and not even God can fix that.<br />I know that most people think &quot;God&quot; is at least a better answer than no answer, but its not.  God is just a magic &quot;black box&quot; (to borrow from Dr. Behe, who called the cell a black box) that can fix every question.<br />If you already believe that God makes a good answer for any mystery, then you'll love this book. If you don't, you will see it is just more dishonesty from Strobel.	2004-05-31

And, I can agree somewhat.  He touches on so many subjects, that he doesn't really delve deeply into any single one.  But, I don't think his goal was to try to do a scholarly defense of each of his claims. He was trying to give an overview of many of the arguments against theism, too much depth would probably loose a lot of his intended audience.<br />Sometimes, I found myself surprised that he acts as if he doesn't know how a theist would answer some of his challenges.  Given the fact that he was a preacher for so long, this sometimes seemed strange.  But, overall, I'd have to say that the strengths far outweight the negatives.  So, 4 out of 5 stars is what I rate it.	2003-09-15

I see five recent 1-star reviews; by Mapupin, Collins, Vestuto, Becker & Pipkin. I find it unlikely they've actually read the book. They complain about Doherty having \\"lack of scholarship\\".  The accuse Doherty of engaging in \\"ad-homin attacks\\". But all their reviews amount to are nothing but ad-homin attacks against Doherty. Do any of these reviewers actually produce any specific error in Doherty's arguments? No, not so much as one single error did any one-star reviewer produce. Hmmm...<br />Now I personally didn't happen to care for Doherty's courtroom setting either. But I understand that he felt he needed some sort of metaphor for presenting the arguments. Somebody complained that Doherty didn't really follow standards of legal presentation. Did Strobel? Come on, it was a metaphor folks!<br />Many people complain Doherty didn't interview Strobel's experts. Does anybody honestly think any of Strobel's experts would agree to an interview that isn't pre-programmed to make them look good? Doherty would be more than happy to interview them if they would actually agree to an interview.<br />If somebody actually has any errors in Doherty's work, lets hear them.	2003-06-09

I see a lot of people complain about Dawkins' snide remarks about Creationism.  And probably he should have left that out, letting the evidence speak for itself.  But its not like such comments make up a significant part of the book.  The majority of the book is indeed on the subject at hand.<br />His little biomorph program is indeed contrived.  He admits so himself.  The idea was to explain concepts, not be any sort of proof.  But I could see how someone could argue the point that the biomorph program is so contrived that it could (possibly) be misleading.  And for that reason, I think that maybe the discussion of the biomorph program could perhaps have been abridged.<br />For numerous reasons, including Dawkins' derission of Creationism, I'm sure that Creationists in general will hate it.  But yet, I could imagine it being possible for a Creationist to read some of the material, such as the description of how bat sonar works and actually enjoy it.  Of course such a reader would find much to not like, but some material could still be interesting regardless of whether you agree with his evolutionary ideas or not.<br />And one thing that I found interesting is that to me, one hand hand it seemed to provide great evidence for evolution.  And yet it simultaneously underscored how evolution could seem so impossible!  Ironic...<br />Good book.  Read it for yourself.	2002-11-24

I certainly recognize he is a gifted writer.  All I am trying to do is say why, at least for me, he didn't prove his case.<br />The book is divided into four books, and at this time I'm only intending on commenting on the first two.  The reason being that the latter two books are for Christians.  The first two are for those that are contemplating Christianity.<br />Lewis starts out his argument for the existence of God by first attempting to prove the existence of what he calls \\"The Moral Law\\".  It seems that a reader's perception of the strength of Lewis' argument for the existence of God completely stands or falls based on whether said reader is convinced by the argument of the existence of this purported Law.  Lewis argues that it seems that everybody has some innate understanding of a proper, moral behavior.  He says that if we didn't, it would make no sense to say that Nazi's behaved \\"badly\\".  Saying they behaved \\"badly\\" only makes sense if you have a fundamental understanding of what it would mean to behave well.<br />My first complaint is that I feel he trivializes the differences of morality amongst different cultures.  He agrees that there are differences but says \\"these have never amounted to anything of a total difference... Men have differed as to whether you should have one wife or four.  But they have always agreed that you should not simply have any woman you liked.\\"  Considering how much to do Christians (including Lewis himself) usually make of the properness of the biblical \\"one man, one woman\\" concept, it seems odd to have him say that isn't a real difference.  Lewis neglects to mention that some cultures have found it acceptable for men to kill their wives if they find them displeasing.  This isn't a real difference?<br />However, I do agree that at least most cultures have had some form of \\"The Golden Rule\\".  In fact, Lewis himself later refers to \\"The Golden Rule of the New Testament (do as you would be done by)\\".  So, if I accept that at least most cultures have had some form of this, the question then becomes, where did it come from?  Lewis discusses two naturalistic possibilities, instinct and learned behavior.  Lewis dismisses these.  To dismiss instinct, Lewis discusses the scenario where somebody sees someone in trouble.  They may have the instinct to run away to protect themselves.  And he says they may have the instinct to help the other person.  Yet somehow the person must make a choice between the two instincts, and the means that one employs to make that choice must be The Moral Law.  It seems to me that it is more likely to be learned behavior even though Lewis dismisses that possibility.<br />I shouldn't say that Lewis completely dismisses that The Moral Law as being learned behavior.  In fact, he agree that it is, much like the multiplication tables are something that you learn.  But we couldn't have arbitrarily made up the multiplication tables.  Nor, he argues, could we have arbitrarily decided The Moral Law. For evidence of this, he again reiterates his claim that all cultures have had similar morality; and if morality were arbitrary then that wouldn't be so.  As I've said, I'm not convinced this is the case.  But I have agreed that most cultures have had some form of The Golden Rule.  So Lewis would say that I'm agreeing with him.  Well, not really.  Is there any other possible explanation for the universitality of The Golden Rule?  I think there is.  For my own self preservation, it seems obvious that I would want other people to not to decide to arbitrarily kill me.  It also seems obvious that I would have no reason to have such expectation of other people, if I won't likewise arbitrarily go kill them.  It doesn't seem to me that it requires a God to have told me this.  Granted, in today's society, the concept of treating others as you would have them treat you sometimes seems to be in amazingly short supply.  Yet I'd still say that it really shouldn't take a rocket scientist, let alone God, to figure this out.<br />Lewis accepts some desire to help others is instinct.  He calls it the \\"herd instinct\\".  I'd prefer to call it \\"empathy\\".  Many Christians ask why would this evolve?  If we evolved, wouldn't we evolve primarily the instinct to save ourselves?  However, Lewis doesn't ask this question and accepts that we do in fact have such an instinct.  But he believes that the self-preservation is a stronger instinct and that therefore if someone chooses to help someone instead of saving themselves, it must be because of The Moral Law.  However, he doesn't seem to offer any proof that the self-preservation instinct would be stronger than empathy.  But even if he is correct and self-preservation is the stronger instinct, the combination of learned behavior plus the \\"herd instinct\\" seems to me to be quite capable of being stronger than the self-preservation instinct, at least in some individuals in some situations.  Maybe I can't prove that my explanation is correct.  But I assert that Lewis has not proven it to be wrong.ally shouldn't take a rocket scientist, let alone God, to figure this out.<br />Lewis accepts some desire to help others is instinct.

It is 800 pages and I really didn't finish all of it.  But, I have some amount of interest as I at least used to hear Christians claim that homosexuality is \\"unnatural\\" which this books seems to show fairly convincingly otherwise.<br />I enjoyed the chapters discussing possible reasons for the existence of homosexuality.  The author agrees that it doesn't serve any obvious purpose.  However, he discusses a few possible theories.  One theory about at least one species of bird is that male pairs do better at gathering food and protecting territory.  So, a male pair, so long as at least one of the males engages in some heterosexual activity to produce an offspring, could have some evolutionary advantage.  But the author admits the evidence for this or other theories is scant at best.  The conclusion seems to be that much sexual behavior, in animals and people, serves no obvious purpose - it just is.<br />So, if you have some interest in the subject, I'm sure you'll like it.  But if your interest is only moderate, it may be too much.	2002-08-17

Though I agree that the universe and all the constraints to make us possible are most amazing, never-the-less, I don't find it a convincing evidence for God.  See my Amazon review of _The Creator and The Cosmos_ by Hugh Ross for more on this.<br />Glynn uses NDE's as evidence for God, which was about the only thing that I find of interest in his book.  Frankly, I just don't know what NDE's mean.  Maybe they are a glimpse of eternity, or maybe not.  But the fact that there are many similarities, but many differences in experiences leads me to think that maybe they aren't.  But I just don't know.  Actually, I hope they are real.  I've a niece that had one and she says she met her departed grandfather.  I just don't know.<br />Glynn says the value of church attendance is proven by decreased suicide rates, drug use, etc.  Actually, I'm sure that is true.  For example, I used to attend a church singles group, not because I was a \\"believer\\" but simply to meet people.  And I did develop good friends there.  So what I'm saying is that I recognize that churches can have value, but it may not necessarily be directly due to God's hand, but rather due to the hands of those that make up the church.<br />Glynn's discussion of the moral basis of the Church, well, I've got a few things to say.  He does make a reference to the Crusades and expectedly condemns them.  And I don't want the following to sound like I'm bashing Christians; I know that by and large they are good people.  And I accept that people like those that partook in the Crusades were not acting in accordance with Christianity.  But my problem with Glynn (and other apologists) is that they want to give Christianity no blame for the bad things done by Christians, but want to give full blame to atheism for bad things done by atheists.<br />In fact, after having made his token condemnation of thecrusades, he then pompously claims how throughout history, \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" has \\"tracked closely\\" with atheism.  I'd like to see his chart.  Does his chart include not only the Crusades, but also the many Protestant/Catholic wars?  Witch hunts?  Let's see this chart!<br />And I've got another problem with The Church being the moral foundation.  Assuming that Jesus was the Messiah and he came to Earth 2000 years ago for the purpose of giving the straight scoop on good and bad behavior, well, that doesn't seem to me to have been the most effective method.  Would anybody consider it a good way for a father to teach his child morals to write down some parables (whose meaning is not always clear) before the child is born and leave town?  If those that do evil in God's name are perverting His teachings, where is God to say, \\"hey, folks, this isn't right!\\"  Is it reasonable for Him to say, \\"hey, I told you once 2000 years ago the whole deal and if you can't figure it out, that's your problem\\"?<br />Here are perhaps some more modern examples.  Most Christian churches discourage divorce.  Okay.  Some are very strict, only allowable in case of adultery.  Some are more lenient.  Some insist on no alcohol consumption at all, some allow some alcohol.  I can think of some others, but this is sufficient. The point is, not even His own followers can seem to agree exactly on the morals that God supposedly teaches.  Christians may say that without God, then morals are based on nothing but what man may (or may not) find convenient.  Maybe, but if God has defined an ultimate standard of morals, He hasn't done a good job of communicating it to even His own followers.  It seems that man has to make up our own morals by this reason alone.<br />Finally, even if you insist that Christ's teachings are in fact a good guideline for morals, okay, I won't argue further.  But the teachings are what they are, regardless of whether Jesus was God, just a man, or a mythic figure.  The teachings are still the same.  So Jesus' morals, regardless of how good they are, really don't prove that God had any hand in them.	2002-04-30

I can see that Dr. Ross is intelligent.  And has a good grasp of science.  But that seems to not make him any better at theology.  I'd like to talk about his discussion of evil and hell.<br />Dr. Ross' chapters on evil and hell are roughly what any other apologetic writer would say, with all the same flaws.  I was surprised, however, that he says that it is actually a good thing that Satan brought evil into the world as we need it to test us.  Seems rather strange that God Almighty, who is presumably all Good, would find evil a useful tool.  So God is a willing and able accomplice to evil?  This seems to be rather strange theology, Dr. Ross.<br />So why doesn't Satan just shoot massive pain through everybody until they confess their allegiance to Satan?  Ross explains that Satan is not allowed to tempt us more than we are capable of withstanding.  So I guess that means that nobody is ever successfully tempted by Satan, right?  If they are, then by definition, they have been tempted more than they can withstand, right?<br />I guess Dr. Ross is saying that Satan is only allowed to tempt us to the extent that God expects us to be able to withstand.  But if Satan can use supernatural powers against us, even \\"a little bit\\" then how can we really have free will?  How can God really expect us, mere mortals, to be able to withstand any temptation by a supernatural evil being?<br />For example, some Christians believe that fossils were placed on Earth to mislead man to believing in evolution.  I know that most Christians do not believe this - I just happened to pick this for an example - any other would do.  So say that Satan did in fact place fossils on Earth to mislead man to believe evolution.  This would mean I can't believe anything I see, or what any of my other senses tell me, for they could be just satanic delusions.  How can I have free will if I there is nothing that I can know? So I say again, if Satan can use any of his supernatural powers against us, then free will does not exist.<br />Here is another way to look at it.  If Ross is right and God limits Satan's evil, then is Satan constantly asking God, \\"hey, God, can I, like, shoot massive pain through Joe's body and see if that tempts Joe?\\"  And God says, \\"no, Satan, you may not\\".  And then Satan asks, \\"well can I, like, kill Joe's baby and see if that tempts him?\\"  And then God says, \\"oh, okay, Satan, I guess you can do that.\\"  You probably think I'm being sacrilegious.  But the point is, theologies like Ross presents about evil and Satan may sound logical when you read them in a book.  But when you try to take them off the pages of the book and see how they might work in practice, they become exposed as just being pat answers that have no real value.<br />As far as hell, Dr. Ross seems to be painted into a corner, trying to defend the indefensible.  He wants to make hell look like a bad place, and yet not make God appear vindictive in sending people there.  And Ross fails miserably.  He says that those people who are in hell are inherently evil and will never change and that is why they have to stay in hell forever.  Why is it that Christians teach that no matter what bad things a person has done in his life, it is never too late to repent and choose God - at least until they die.  But that at the moment a person dies, they mysteriously loose any ability to ever repent.  Why?  Why couldn't somebody repent some time after they died?<br />Dr. Ross also says that as far as any pain or suffering that God inflicts upon those in hell, it is merely an unfortunate necessity.  The people in hell are so evil that they would be doing terrible things to each other if God wasn't distracting them with pain.  Oh, gimme a break!  God Almighty can't think of a better way to prevent people in hell from inflicting evil upon each other?  Dr. Ross' God, for being omniscient, is astoundingly short-sighted.  God couldn't come up with a punishment/reward system in hell where those that insist on harming others are kept in solitary confinement while those that behave well are allowed some more freedom?

US	51664846	R1I269YPNEAPKS	1576832880	344864152	The Creator and the Cosmos: How the Latest Scientific Discoveries of the Century Reveal God	Books	2	29	59	N	N	Not convincing	I still hold on to some vestige of agnosticism, though I get closer to atheism every day. The more I read apologetics, the more I'm convinced of the weakness of their case.<br />I will certainly grant that Ross presents a lot of information on how incredible the universe is. This portion of his book is enjoyable and I can recommend it.<br />Ross, and many others, term our universe as \\"finely-tuned\\" and I won't disagree. Yet when one ponders how our universe could be so \\"finely-tuned\\", it seems there are two families of explanations for it:<br />1. Our \\"finely-tuned\\" universe came about via purely natural means.<br />2. A God exists capable of creating such a finely tuned universe.<br />There are many forms of option 1, such as pure chance, and infinite numbers of universes. And, as there are many religions and denominations, there are also many forms of option 2.<br />Ross argues that any form of option 1 is just a pure unmeasurable, untestable guess. And you know what? He's 100% correct. We absolutely cannot quantify the probability of any form of option 1. But the problem is, any form of option 2 is just an \\"escape-hatch\\" that is absolutely just as unmeasurable and untestable. We can't put God in a test-tube. We can't discover what forces He may have employed to create the universe. We can only just guess.<br />No one can calculate the probability of either option 1 or 2. Ross tries to show how unlikely any form of 1 is, so that proves it must be 2. But the reverse can also be done; any form of option 2 can be shown to be so unlikely that option 1 must be true.<br />You say that the universe had to come from somewhere? It couldn't just \\"be\\"? So therefore there has to be a God? How come the universe can't just \\"be\\" but God doesn't need something to have created Him? Any \\"problem\\" that seems to exist in option 1 and therefore requires option 2 doesn't solve said \\"problem\\" unless you can explain how God is exempt from the \\"problem\\". Saying God just must be exempt from the \\"problem\\" is no better answer than saying the \\"problem\\" with option 1 must not be a \\"problem\\" after all.<br />So there really isn't any genuine scientific reason to pick option 1 or option 2. So, all we can really do is look at circumstantial evidence and see which option seems more likely. Most people, theists and atheists alike, would expect that if option 2 is true, God would want those He created to know about Him. Maybe not, but it seems like a reasonable guess. And after much reading, I've concluded that the circumstantial evidence for at least the Judeo-Christian God is not compelling.<br />Ross tries to show how the Bible teachings are consistent with the Big Bang Theory. But he uses only scripture that supports his thesis and conveniently ignores scripture which doesn't. For example, Genesis teaches that God created the Earth first, and even put vegetation on the Earth before creating the sun, moon, and stars! This has utterly no similarity to Big Bang Theory! So Ross ignores it. Also, Genesis teaches that man and all the animals were created as vegetarian and never die. If you accept Big Bang Theory, then you have to accept most science and archeology. Fossils show carnivorous animals and death existed before man came on the scene. Does Ross say anything about this? No of course not.<br />And what about Bible prophesies that supposedly foretell of Christ? Apologists frequently quote scripture that says, \\"they pierce my hands and feet\\" as being a prophecy of Christ. (See Lee Strobel's books.) Actually that scripture is about being attacked by lions and is hardly a convincing crucifixion prophesy! Apologists will point to all the amazing parallels between the OT stories and the Gospels. Once you see that the similarities bear the mark of someone writing an allegorical story intentionally drawing upon the OT for material, then the concept that the OT represents supernatural confirmational prophesies of Christ evaporates. (See Earl Doherty's books for more information on this.)<br />Take for example C.S. Lewis, who wrote popular allegory intentionally drawing upon the Gospels for his stories. That doesn't make them true. I've read Lewis' _The Great Divorce_, which is about a bus ride from hell to heaven. What if somehow that story became to be believed as historical fact? Someone in 2000 years could argue something like: \\"We have uncovered evidence that Lewis was a fine, honorable man who we can say with confidence would not try to deceive people. We find that busses were in fact in common use during Lewis' lifetime. Also, there are hundreds of similarities between his story and the Gospels. Clearly, this could not all be coincidence and must be concluded to supernatural confirmation of Lewis' writings. Here, in the year 4000, we might think it odd that God would use an ordinary bus to transport people in the afterlife. But we must conclude that God felt it would lend comfort for those people familiar with busses. Probably God also runs magic carpet rides for those people that would find that more comfortable.\\"<br />You say I'm being absurd? This is ridiculous? Maybe, but can you really say what I've just said is any more absurd than God used an OT reference to being attacked by lions to prophesize the coming of the Messiah and if you don't believe it, that is the most unforgivable crime punishable by eternal damnation? Is my analogy really more absurd? Really?<br />So now let's look back at my two options about the origin of the universe. Both I grant seem to be unbelievably unlikely. Yet it seems one must be true. But if option 2 is true, God didn't leave any plausible evidence. So now, which option, 1 or 2, really seems more likely?	2002-03-30
US	51664846	R3TJDUIE8RIO9H	0968601405	865805341	The Jesus Puzzle. Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? : Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus	Books	5	21	26	N	Y	Yes, it is a "puzzle"...	Here is the \\"Puzzle\\" about Jesus Christ as Doherty explains it:  Did you know that in all the Pauline corpus, Paul never once quotes Jesus Christ?  Did you know that none of the parables or teachings of the Gospels are ever referenced even once by Paul?  Or that he never once mentions Joseph or Mary?   Nor ever once mentions any miracles or healings?  <br />So this rather strange lack of reference to anything Jesus Christ ever said or did in the Pauline corpus is a \\"puzzle\\", The Jesus Puzzle.  By the way, I can certainly see how a Christian would easily consider Doherty's theories in TJP to be \\"outlandish\\" or \\"far-fetched\\".  If you have a similar reaction, that's okay.  Just hear me out.<br />Basically, Doherty argues the explanation to the \\"puzzle\\" is:<br />1. Paul believed in a Jesus Christ as a spiritual being and had no knowledge of any human Jesus Christ or any knowledge of the Gospels.<br />2. There were a number of conflicting traditions in the area at the time. There was the Jewish traditions. Some pagan traditions. The \\"Q\\" community that had a list of morals they believed in. And there was the Pauline \\"Jesus Christ as a newly revealed spiritual Being\\" tradition. Somebody decided that these traditions would make a good backdrop for a fictional allegory casting Jesus as a human on Earth. Doherty thinks the author probably never intended anyone to think of it as history any more that C.S. Lewis expected his allegory to be thought of as history.<br />3. Sometime after that, the fictional allegory became regarded as factual history.<br />You may be saying that's just plain crazy.  Maybe.  But let me continue.  There are a number of times in the Pauline corpus that Paul seems to be talking about a living man, as modern Christians understand Him to be.  Paul says such things as, \\"born of woman\\", \\"died and resurrected\\". Doherty explains these apparent references to a living man in basically these ways:<br />1. At the time, the spiritual realm was considered to operate more like our physical realm. People at the time believed that people walked around, ate, drank, had sex, etc., in the spiritual world.  So some things that sound like Paul is talking about happening in the physical realm, Paul was trying to say that they happened in the spiritual realm.<br />2. Translations of Paul's words are generally done by people that believe that Paul was talking about the Gospel's Jesus Christ and therefore the translations are flavored that way.<br />3. Paul thought of the Jesus Christ in the spiritual realm as having an analogous purpose in heaven as man does on Earth - Paul believed Christ is the \\"man\\" of heaven as humans are the \\"man\\" of Earth.  So Paul's references to Jesus Christ sounding like he is talking about a man is allegorical.<br />Now I can quite easily see a Christian saying, \\"look, Paul says a man, born of woman, buried, resurrected, etc. It's clear he's talking about the same Jesus Christ as the Gospels. Doherty's just going through contortions to force his conclusions.\\" Yeah I can see that a Christian would say that. And I'd probably even agree if Doherty's other arguments weren't so strong.<br />By the way, I've read some critiques of Doherty - who basically try to say that everybody knew all that stuff and so Paul had no need to mention it.  I'm sure that could explain part of it.  But really, did everybody really know all that?  Paul was writing letters to teach people about Jesus Christ.  How could it be possible that he could write letters about Jesus Christ without ever mentioning anything Jesus said or did?<br />After all, if Paul is in fact speaking of the Jesus Christ of the Gospels, the man who is supposedly also God, I think Paul would have to explain how a man could be God. This was a foreign concept to his audience. If I ask a Christian today why believe Jesus was God, they'd say he raised Lazarus from the dead, was crucified under Pontias Pilate, etc. Any Christian would, but Paul didn't bother to do this? This seems hard to believe.<br />Particularly when there are times when Paul is talking about things that Jesus supposedly taught, such as marriage and the like.  Is it not very curious that Paul never, ever, not even once (at least in the Pauline corpus that we have in the Bible) said, \\"well, this is what Jesus had to say on the subject...\\" ?<br />You might say that Paul probably did in some documents that didn't survive.  Of course that is possible.  But still, isn't it strange that this never happened even once in the documents that we do have in the Bible?  I've been to church many times.  Maybe not every sermon happens to include quotes of Jesus, but certainly a high percentage of them do.  So, why not ever once in the Pauline corpus?<br />So it seems that if Doherty is wrong and Paul is in fact talking about a human, then at the very least, Paul seems to know very little of the events and teachings as depicted in the Gospels.  It is just inconceivable that he would have known about them and yet never drawn upon them for material in his writings.  So even if Paul is talking about a human man, the human man he must be talking about has little to do with the Jesus Christ of the Gospels.  Once you realize that, then Doherty's theory that Paul didn't think of Jesus as a physical human man at all makes more sense.<br />By the way, on the back of the book, Doherty includes a somewhat unusal quote for someone trying to sell his book. \\"You present nothing new here that your master, Satan, has not previously used to deceive the simple.\\" Enjoy!	2002-03-19
US	51664846	R2AXW2OXYJWZ03	0968925901	434595631	Challenging the Verdict: A Cross-Examination of Lee Strobel's "The Case for Christ"	Books	4	48	57	N	Y	I've read Strobel and Doherty - Doherty is better	I've read and reviewed here Strobel's books.  (See more about me.)<br />Okay, much has been said about Doherty's style of using a courtroom setting.  Yes, I understand it is a literary device.  And yes, I know, he's poking some fun at Strobel's self-portrail of being a &quot;tough, investigative reporter&quot;.  Okay, I understand it, but I still don't care for it.  But while I don't care for the style, what is more important, to me anyway, is the material.  And the material is good.<br />Since I'm very poor at history, there is much here that I can't really honestly say whether Strobel's version or Doherty's is more accurate.  I wish I could, but I can't.  But when Doherty is able to demonstrate logic errors and circular reasoning in Strobel's work that I didn't catch myself when reading it, that to me lends credence to his work.  One good example of this is where Doherty points out that Dr. Craig used the Gospel of Matthew's account of the guards at the tomb as an alternate-source verification of, well, Matthew's account of the guards at the tomb!<br />Another interesting point that Doherty makes is in the discussion of the medical evidence.  In Strobel, Dr. Metherell portrays crucifixion being a form of torture to which even breathing is difficult due to the way the victim is hung.  And yet the gospels portray Jesus as carrying on conversations, including with the bandits that were also being crucified.  And Doherty also points out how the scene gets embellished from one gospel to the next.<br />There's a lot more than these couple of items I've pointed out.  Get the book.  If you read the other reviews of the book, you'll find that the negative reviews usually call Doherty &quot;outlandish&quot; or some such, but few seem to have any actual evidence to dispute him.<br />The negative reviews also harp on Doherty's belief that Jesus may not have existed at all.  Though Doherty does discuss this opinion of his, it is not central to this work.  I'm not sure I buy that theory myself.  But even if Doherty is all wet on that theory, it is not significant to this work.<br />Finally, the negative reviews also condemn the literary style, which as I said, I agree with the criticism to some extent.  But ignoring the style, there is a lot of good stuff here.  Don't let the positive or negative opinions here sway you, read the book and make up your own mind.	2002-03-02

For those who are in the book's target audience, I'm sure it is a wonderful book. If the description \\"enjoys Christian allegory\\" fits you, ignore my bad review and read the other reviews. All I'm saying is that for me, it was so boring I couldn't hardly finish it. I only read it because a Christian friend gave it to me.<br />Just a few other small comments. In his introduction, Lewis finds it necessary to remind the reader that it is allegory, and he is not trying in any way to factually describe the afterlife. In fact he says, \\"encouraging factual curiosity of the afterlife is the last thing I want to do\\". Well, um, then what's the point? Though I maintain being agnostic, but I have to admit I lean more towards atheism. One of the reasons being that no one has presented, to my mind anyway, a plausible scenerio for what the afterlife is really like. An infinite life where there is presumably no pain or evil, would have to be inherently very different from our mortal existence.  So different if such does exist, then it seems difficult to imagine any purpose to this very limited existence we have here. After all, a billion years from now, are you going to be sitting around heaven talking about the time your aunt died or something? I'm wondering if the reason Lewis doesn't want to \\"encourage factual curiosity\\" about the afterlife is because that when one tries to ponder it factually, it seems rather implausible.<br />I think that a Christian would say that a quote late in the book more or less sums up what Lewis is trying to say. Lewis says that \\"there are two kinds of people, those that say to God 'thy will be done' and those that God says to them, 'thy will be done.'\\" Well, don't take the following statement as \\"bashing\\" Christians, I am fully aware that by and large, Christians are fine people. But of course there are those that claim to be Christians that don't seemlike such fine people. My only point in this is that I basically reject that there is some intrinsic difference between those that choose to be Christians and those that don't. The point of the book is to try to show this supposed intrinsic difference, an intrisic difference would would last for eternity, which I reject exists. I reject Lewis' premise. I'm just in general not a big fan of allegory. And even Lewis himself says it says nothing about the real form of heaven and hell. So for me, it was a boring, useless waste of time. But if you are a Christian and like allegory, well, ignore me, I'm sure you'll like the book.<br />NOTE:  At the time of this edit of my review, I've got 0 out of 4 helpful votes.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised as I'm giving a negative review of a popular book.  But the point is - is my review actually helpful? And I think it is.  I freely admit that those in the target audience will like it and I explain why I don't like it.  That's what's called a GOOD review folks - don't say it is a bad review just because you don't like my opinion!	2002-01-21

However, I can't deny that it is a well written book.  It is certainly a better book than most Creationist works.<br />He at least tries to cover most of the known criticisms of ID.  For example, the most common counter argument to the concept that &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; systems arise when parts that exist for some other reason get put into service in a new system that then seems &quot;irreducibly complex&quot;.  Behe claims that at least of the &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; systems that he discusses, the individual parts are in fact harmful if the other pieces aren't there.  So he claims that prevents them from evolving for other reasons and then becoming part of an irreducibly complex system.<br />He also covered the argument from imperfection.  ID skeptics say a designer wouldn't have designed imperfections that we see.  However, he says that sometimes things are designed in ways that seem to not be optimal for those that don't know the intentions of the designer.  He makes the claim that science can discern &quot;design&quot; and therefore ID is science.  But says that what the designer is like is beyond science and is to be left to philosophers and theologians.  Therefore, it would be up to those to try to answer questions as to why the unnamed designer designed things the way they are.<br />Behe makes numerous claims that there just isn't any viable research to explain the &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; systems he describes except of course ID.  Many people claim that Behe is just wrong, there's lots of data on evolution on the biochemical level.  Behe responds, &quot;yes, but...&quot;  He claims that people are able to explain how &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; systems evolve after they come into being, but never has anybody figured out how the &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; systems came into being in the first place.  Well, as a non-biologist, I really can't say one way orthe other.<br />He does admit at least the possibility that such explanations could be found someday.  But he says that is unlikely, that it would be like someone discovering that computers had evolved and weren't designed.<br />What is somewhat funny is that not once but twice he says that he finds the evidence for evolution from a common ancestor to be &quot;compelling&quot;.  He says his expertise is in biochemistry and therefore says little about biology at the macroscopic level.  But he gives some hints that maybe he believes in macroscopic evolution and maybe he doesn't.  Or maybe undecided.  But he proposes that at least one possibility is the &quot;intelligent designer&quot; created a single-celled organism with all the &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; systems in place, and let everything evolve from there.<br />As basically a lay person, I can't really honestly either defend or refute Behe.  All I can say is that I have read his work, and a number of critiques of his work, and in my mind the critiques are stronger.  If, as Behe is willing to admit, the evidence for macroscopic evolution is &quot;compelling&quot;, it only seems reasonable that probably it will eventually be compelling at the microscopic level.  The theory that God created an ameoba and let everything evolve from there seems rather incredulous to me.<br />Behe's argument, even though he denies it, it is in fact a &quot;God in the gaps&quot; argument.  A &quot;God in the tiny gaps&quot; argument, as one reviewer has put it.  Behe probably does the best defense of ID there is, but that still doesn't mean it is right.	2002-01-18

I know that both books feature well qualified, prominent Christian apologists, yet I found the interviews in CFF to be mostly drivel.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that the interviews in CFC to be much more thoughtful and interesting.  I'm convinced that those who are already Christians, or those leaning that way, would find this book to be strongly supportive of Christian views.<br />Even so, for those that are skeptical to begin with, I don't think they would be swayed by this book.  Strobel tries very hard to give the appearance that he has researched all the counter-arguments and his interviews systematically strikes them all down.  The problem is it looks much more like he has simply chosen counter-arguments that he knows his interviewees know how to respond to.<br />There are a number of works countering the arguments Strobel makes in this book.  I've read the critique of the book by the Internet Infidels.  There is also an entire book dedicated to critique this book, _Challenging the Verdict_ by Earl Doherty, available here at Amazon.com which I have not read.<br />The problem that I have is basically, even if Strobel and his interviewees are 100% right on (and those critiques of Strobel's work are totally off base,) is it reasonable for God to expect us to know it?  Is it not a reasonable thing for those undecided to suspect that Strobel, his interviewees, and the Gospel itself to be biased in favor of Christianity?  After all, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a similar work by a Muslim to demonstrate the validity of Islam.  And a similar book by a Buddhist to support Buddhism, etc.  If I were to express the opinion that I'm skeptical that Mohammed said and did what Muslims say, a Christian would consider that reasonable.  If I were to express the opinion that I'm skeptical that Rev. Moon is who he says he is, a Christian would say that is reasonable.  But if I were to say that I'm skeptical that Jesus says who he says he was, apparently that is a crime punishable by eternal damnation.  This isn't reasonable.<br />Really, in essence, Christianity isn't so much a faith in Jesus - nobody alive today has ever met him.  Christianity is faith in the men that wrote the Gospels and those that espouse its validity.  So, really, if Christianity is true, then it basically means that God expects us to have faith in the PEOPLE that support Christianity.  God Himself, seems to have done nothing in two-thousand years to prove Himself.  He leaves our fate in the hands of those that espouse Christianity.<br />So, even if it so happens that those that espouse Christianity are in fact right, why would it be an expectation of God for those of us living two thousand years later to know that or send us to hell while simultaneously knowing that all the other religions and those that espouse them are false?<br />So, as I said, Strobel's CFC is a good read and Christians will just love it, but I think the counter-arguments he tries to dispel are straw-men.n that I'm skeptical that Rev.

(For commentators on my original review here, please see the end of this review.)<br />I'm an agnostic, but I have to say I learn more towards atheism. I don't want to believe I'm nothing more than chance atoms, but the apologetics that I've read to support faith, including this one, are so utterly inane that I had to force myself to read.<br />One of the editorial reviews commented, \\"Strobel's occasional melodramatic note (did he really speak 'in a voice laden with sarcasm' to any of these, his fellow believers?) seems ridiculous\\" is on target. Such comments by Strobel just scream, \\"SEE HOW OBJECTIVE I AM, AREN'T I!!!\\" Puke.<br />For the question on the the existence of evil and suffering argument, Strobel used the two standard responses:<br />1. God gave us free will, and therefore the ability to create evil.<br />2. Suffering is sometimes necessary for a greater good we cannot at the time see.<br />The person he interviewed for this question used an analogy that someone trying to free a bear trapped in a hunter's trap might be interpreted by the bear as being an attacker rather than a helper. In the process of getting the bear's paw out of the trap, it might hurt and seem to only prove to the bear that the rescuer is an attacker. The bear cannot see the good that is coming from the pain of pulling the paw out of the trap. Sometimes we cannot understand what God can, and we are like the bear unable to see the good to come. Superficially, that seems reasonable... But not really. First off, why did God make us not more wise so that we can better see the good that is to come? If He made us like the bear, unable to understand what He understands, He should not be surprised that we come to conclusions consistent with our level of understanding any more than we should be surprised that the bear comes to conclusions consistent with its level of understanding.<br />Another analogy given is that there is supposedly a Twilight Zone episode where a man dies and goes to heaven. No suffering. No pain. But soon he is bored and wishes he could go to the \\"Other Place\\" instead - only to find out he already is in the \\"Other Place\\". So he says that an existence on Earth without evil and suffering would be like the hell of the Twilight Zone episode where you are quickly bored and spoiled. Oh, gimme a break! If Strobel is REALLY trying to ask \\"the tough questions\\" and if he REALLY believes that a world without pain, suffering and evil would make us bored and spoiled, then what exactly does Strobel think heaven is really like? Is Satan, Hitler, Stalin, etc. up there randomly wreaking havoc in heaven, torturing and killing people so that we aren't bored all the time? If this is the case, I have a suggestion for God, force people in heaven to read Strobel books as a form of occasional suffering...<br />Here is, in my opinion, the real crux of the matter. Heaven, if it exists, would have to be entirely different than life on Earth. A life that is known to be infinite would be inherently different than a mortal life such as ours. Any explanation of why evil and suffering exists on Earth such as the arguments given by Strobel may sound plausible, until you realize such arguments could not possibly apply to heaven. And if they don't apply in heaven, then why would they have to apply to life on Earth?<br />And if life is infinite in heaven, and therefore completely different, then what possible value is life on Earth? Of what importance is our existance here? In a billion years from now, while in heaven, are you going to be talking about the time your aunt died?<br />And nobody has ever come up with a plausible explanation for what value prayer is. If things happen like the terrorist attack on New York because God cannot intercede in the free will of the attackers, then why bother praying? He can't do anything anyway. Or, if God can sometimes decide todo something, sometimes, based on whether or not people pray for it, what kind of a God is that? This seems to be a God that lets evil and suffering happen unless He decides that there have been enough people praying. No, ultimately, God either can't do anything, and is therefore useless, or He can do something, and is therefore fully responsible for all evil and suffering. There really isn't any plausible in-between.<br />I notice that a couple of other reviewers have commented on my original version of this review.  One says that I don't understand faith.  What you don't know is how hard and for how many years I've tried to have faith.  I've tried, but when I can't find logical answers to my questions, I've found it impossible.<br />Another reviewer claims simply understanding the concept of evil, which would have no absolute meaning without God, in itself implies there is a god.  But this is not true.  \\"Hot\\" is a relative term, but I have a biological basis for what is hot and what isn't.  \\"Pain\\" is a relative term, but I have a biological understanding of pain.  The concept of evil comes from our biological understanding of pain and our biological ability to empathize (survival of the species mechanisms.)<br />By the way, I see that even one Christian reviewer feels the arguments in this book are just straw-man arguments.

McDougall is one of those that really generates strong reactions, positive and negative.<br />The reviewer that claims that high-starch diet is &quot;scientifically proven&quot; to mess with you insulin is off-base.  High fat with high starch does, high starch with low fat does not.<br />As far as the reviewer that felt that McDougall displays a blase attitude about breast cancer and mamography... Well, what can I say?  I'm not a woman and never had breast cancer.  So I'm sure she would have a very different perspective than I would.  But I really don't see how McDougall's attitude can be considered &quot;blase&quot;.  He is very passionate, you may disagree with him, but I don't see how he can be called &quot;blase&quot;.<br />Now McDougall does have a very negative attitude towards radiation, chemo, and most &quot;standard&quot; treatments for cancers, such as breast cancers.  But I think he makes a good case for his negative attitudes, they have not been shown to extend life, and significantly harm life.<br />Basically, McDougall believes the best treatment for cancer is prevention, and shows why he feels diet and lifestyle are the best preventions.	2001-08-31

One of the most important things about this book is that it does NOT, I repeat NOT, try to reinvent Jesus as a vegetarian. There have been some attempts to try to &quot;prove&quot; Jesus was vegetarian, but the author finds the evidence for such reinventions to not be compelling. The author basically concludes that some consumption of meat is biblically acceptable, so long as the animal has been treated with care and compassion during its life. On the other hand, the author also concludes that vegetarian is preferred, and factory farming would have to be contemptable in God's eyes. By the way, I'm personally an agnostic, and one of the reasons why I have turned away from Christianity is that the Christian church, in general, does not see the obvious truth to the immorality of factory farming. This book is must reading.	2001-08-28
US	51664846	RNREY2PLBHDXO	1887089055	593303610	Diet For Transcendence: Vegetarianism and the World Religions	Books	3	14	16	N	Y	I agree with premise, but some faulty research	Several years ago, I read the original version, when it was titled _Food for the Spirit_.  I recently picked up this, the current version.  There is a new transcript of a radio interview with the auther.  Not much else seems different.  Possibly some small revisions were made elsewhere in the book, but it is not a substantal revision.  I had hoped that the author would have revised more of the material.<br />Basically, I agree with the premise, that modern treatment of animals cannot be justified by any system of morality. Unfortunatly, some of the author's research was faulty.  He relies too much on extra-biblical works of very questionable validity.  For Christianity, the author spends an inordinate amount of time discussing &quot;The Gospel of the Holy Twelve&quot; which has about zero evidence for its being genuine.  To someone who is not already convinced to be in favor of vegetarianism would suspect that if the author needs to spend so much time on disreputable sources then he can't have a very good case.<br />Likewise, for Buddhism, much of the pro-vegetarian sutra is not considered to be genuine.<br />A better tact for the author to have taken might have been to address more how modern inventions such as the factory farm are far different than historical animal husbandry. For Christians, I'd recommend _Is God a Vegetarian?_ The author of that book concludes that Jesus was NOT vegetarian, but Jesus didn't live today either.<br />For Jews, I'd recommend, _Judaism and Vegetarianism_.  Both of these are available here at amazon.com.<br />Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff here. But it seems that in an effort to prove his point, the author did not always use due-diligence to verify all the information, and as such weakens his case substantially.	2001-08-20

I agree with that.  That is why I'm vegetarian.  By doing so, I make more food available to others, and decrease my chances of degenerate disease in the process.<br />I thought the book sometime spent too much time on some subjects, and too little on others.  But still, overall, a good book.<br />Lots of people have tried to make an issue about Hitler's claimed vegetarianism.  Of course whether he was or wasn't has no bearing on his actions.  But since so many people make an issue of it, Spencer had to cover Hitler.  What Spencer says about Hitler isn't the same as what I had heard from other sources.  Most other sources I thought said Hitler enjoyed meat, but gave up most meat due to digestion problems.  Spencer says that Hitler was vegetarian just to be different then everybody else.  Which is true, I don't know, but I would assume that Spencer knows what he is talking about.	2001-08-15

I guess I am in the minority opionion compared to the other reviewers, but I didn't feel that that author met his stated goal in his preface - where he stated his intention was to be understandable by anyone with even a rusty knowledge of algerbra.  I didn't feel he met this level of clarity, though I understand he tried valiently.<br />Some of the other reviewers felt that the author was too anti-religion.  And I'd agree that the author does ridicule &quot;young-earthers&quot;.  But if the author was intending to convince young-earthers the error of their ways, I'm not sure he is successful.  Frankly, I don't think many young-earthers would be able to follow his discussion of radiometric dating.<br />I'm not current with what claims young-earthers are currently making to attempt to discredit radiometric dating, but I thought that there were some criticisms that at least superfically seem plausible that perhaps the author could have specifically addressed.  Perhaps I'm mistaken on this point - I guess I'd have to ask a young-earther what they think is wrong with radiometric dating.<br />I'm not saying it is a bad book, it has its good points.  And certainly most people with a science background should be able to understand and appreciate it.  I'm just not sure you can give it to a young-earther and they'll go, &quot;of course, how silly of me to have thought otherwise!&quot;	2001-08-13
US	51664846	R32TRO2T5KHMUL	0915811812	381791390	Diet for a New America	Books	4	313	323	N	N	The critics are wrong, for the most part	I just read John's newest book, The Food Revolution. In many ways, it makes Diet for a New America obsolete. The Food Revolution is basically a rewrite of Diet for a New America with new information.<br />I looked at some of the reviews here for Diet for a New America. Almost all of the reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star. John certainly does generate rather extreme responses. So, I thought I'd take a look at the negative reviews and see what they have to say.<br />I read some of the reviews of other books made by those who gave Diet for a New America negative reviews to see where they are coming from. One of the negative reviewers gave a 5 star rating to a Protein Power book. So much for that reviewer's knowledge of nutrition. Doctors of both mainstream and alternative medicine virtually unanamously condemn Atkins and his clones.<br />Some of the reviews complain that John's presentation is too emotional. Nature isn't always so kind. Not all animals are cute little puppies to play with. Fair enough - I'm not going to go pet an aligator any time soon. But does that then mean we have the right to engage in systematic torture of animals? I'd say that is a rather extreme leap. So is the fact that John tries to tug at our hearts so bad? I guess some readers believe that we humans are merely more &quot;protein conversion machines&quot; that the meat industry thinks of the aninimals it tortures.<br />Some critics would say that John isn't qualified to talk like an expert in nutrition, the environment, animal husbandry, etc. Okay, except for one thing. People who ARE experts in these fields, such as former cattle rancher Howard Lyman (of Oprah Winfry &quot;McLibel&quot; fame,) nutrition experts Dr. T. Colin Campbell of Cornell University, Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. John McDougall, Dr. Neal Barnard, etc. all readily endorse John Robbins work.<br />Possibly the most controversial subject matter would be John's environmental statistics. Even many vegetarians feel that John is tooone-sided on this and try to distance themselves from John for this reason. I'm not an environmental expert, so I guess I can't legitimaly argue with authority who is right. However, even taking more conservative numbers, such as the 450 gallons of water per pound of beef, (instead of John's 2,500 to 12,000 gallons per pound,) even the conservative number is many times less efficient than vegetables. And the vegetables are much more healthy too. So, even conservative numbers are damning enough.<br />In John's latest book, he give more information as to why he feels the conservative numbers are faulty. And I feel that John makes a credible case for his position. But in the end, it doesn't matter, the conservative numbers are bad enough!<br />Even so, I'd still say that some of the material in Diet for a New America is dated. If you haven't read it yet, skip it and go for The Food Revolution. Also get Reclaiming Our Health.<br />Oh, and as far as the video of Diet for a New America, well, I know that nobody could do justice to Diet for a New America in one hour.  So perhaps I was expecting too much.  But I just found the video version just way too skimpy.  I wish I knew of a better video on the environmental issues, but I don't.  Sadly, I really can't recommend the video.	2001-07-29

If you like any of John's books, your sure to love this one. Don't waste any more time, just buy the book!<br />All the other reviews are good, I just wanted to add a few points, and a few very minor nit-picks. First, a critic might want to call the book a &quot;rehash&quot; of Diet for a New America. And there would be some justification to that. It covers essentially the same ground with mostly the same arguments. I think a better title would have been Diet for a New America Revisited. I would have expected the publisher to want to capitialize on the &quot;Diet for a New America&quot; name for marketing reasons as well, as that book clearly has a lot of name recognition.<br />But while it in many ways could be called a &quot;rehash&quot; of Diet for a New America, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The original was a great book, and John has been needing to update the book with current information for some time. So I'm very glad to see that John has done so.<br />Now for a few other minor nits. John recalls a story where he received annonymous transcripts from a dairy vendor's board meetings. Personally, I don't doubt the story is true. But it isn't verifiable. And I think someone reading it might feel that the story smacks of &quot;conspiracy theory,&quot; so I think the story should have been left out.<br />John provides plenty of references as usual, but I did notice on occasion, John provided some statistic or information for which he did not provide a footnote. I think John should have made sure that EVERY statistic provided have some reference.<br />Also, in John's overall completely accurate refutation of some of the current fad diets, like Atkins, Sears (Zone Diet) and the Eat Right for Your Type Diet, he provided a probability statistic that is incorrect. Well, actually, the statistic is actually correct, but the calculation is based on already knowing that the Eat Right for Your Type Diet is rubish. Yes, the diet is rubish, but you can't first assume itis rubish, make a calculation, and then claim that the calculation proves your point. That is circular logic. It is a fine point, but it could be used by someone who wants to discredit John to show that John &quot;just doesn't understand math.&quot; Remember, I completely agree with EVERYTHING else John said about the fad diets, and I'm only complaining about one tiny little probablilty calculation he did. But you must understand math if you are going to use math to support your thesis.<br />Now I'd like to take exception to something in the Library Journal's review.  That review says &quot;Robbins's zealous advocacy of plant-based nutrition and his refusal to consider the need for animal products in human nutrition throws his book off balance.&quot;  That is a false assertion.  While it is true that John does stongly believe vegetarian nutrition is quite healthy, John never says that he believes everyone should turn completely vegetarian.  On the contrary, he indicates that animal husbandry of 100 years ago was reasonably ecologically sound and provided more nutritious food.  For example, John indicates that eggs produced from true &quot;free range&quot; chickens contains 6 times as much essential fatty acids (good fats) as factory-farmed eggs.  I feel the Library Journal's reviewer is revealing his own bias against vegetarianism rather than reading what John actually said.<br />I did find a few tiny little nits to pick, but don't let that deter you from buying the book. Just do it!	2001-07-26
US	51664846	R3GCZQD30Z0Q08	0842318089	894734344	How Now Shall We Live?	Books	2	12	30	N	N	Colson's &quot;us vs. them&quot; doesn't work	As I have been studying Creationism vs evolution, I'm going to focus my review primarily on Colson's Creationist views.<br />First off, I'd really like to be a Creationist.  I sympathize with Colson's moral convictions, and agree that Christian morality depends on the existence of a Christian God.  What I'm less convinced of is the scientific case for the existence of God, which Colson attempts to present.<br />For a moment, I'm going to agree with Colson.  I enjoyed Colson's presentation on the vast number of amazing coincidences in the structure of the universe that are required to make life, at least as we know it, possible.  One that I hadn't heard before is that Colson contends that the rate of expulsion of matter at the time of the Big Bang is critically important.  Had the matter been expelled much faster, and galaxies would not be possible.  Much slower, and the universe would have collapsed too quickly for life to have evolved. Colson contends that the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for the speed of matter expulsion is amazingly small.  This coincidence and all the other amazing coincidences required to make life possible does lead credence to Colson's contention that the probability for the universe  to &quot;accidentally&quot; create life is extremely small.  So this leads one to the possibility of intelligent design.  Okay, so far I'm with Colson.<br />Colson is a staunch supporter of Big Bang Theory.  Prior to Big Bang Theory, scientists believed that the universe and time had no beginning or end.  Big Bang Theory proves a specific time of origin to the universe, &quot;just like the Bible says,&quot; according to Colson.  Further, a law of science is that matter and energy can not be created or destroyed, which seems to have happened at the time of the Big Bang.  So, Colson contends this proves something outside of the universe created it, which could only be God.  I agree that this also seems plausible.<br />Like most Creationists, Colson contends the fossil record doesn't indicate transitional life forms and therefore each animal must have been specifically created.  Further, like most Creationists, he contends the variations we see in life, such as pesticide-resistant insects are merely deviations around a norm and animals do not transition from one kind to another.  <br />Colson doesn't specifically date the universe or the Earth, but given his total support of Big Bang Theory, I have to conclude Colson accepts the age implications of Big Bang Theory.  Therefore, Colson must be an &quot;Old-Earth Creationist&quot;.  \\"Old-Earth Creationists\\" accept that the Earth and the universe is billions of years old, while \\"Young Earth Creationists\\" contend the universe is only a few thousand years old.  But I find it noteworthy that Colson doesn't come out and say whether he is an \\"Old-Earther\\" or not.  The fact that he doesn't make a stand comes off as side-stepping the issue, and it is very important, as I will show.   But as I said, Colson must be an Old-Earther if he accepts the big bang.  But where does that lead us?<br />Let's say for a moment that Colson has proved his case, and has proved that God created all life.  At best, what has Colson proved? Colson seems to have proved that God created the universe billions of years ago.  God created simple life forms on Earth a few billion years ago.  Every few thousand or million years, God goes around and creates some new life forms, and lets some of His older creatures become extinct.  God seems to have created vast numbers of creatures for no apparent purpose other than for us to find fossils of.<br />Though of course God creates new simple creatures frequently, God chooses a general pattern of creating more complex creatures later than simple creatures, over a span of several billion years. God even created other close-kin hominoids to Man such as Neanderthal Man not all that long before homo-sapiens, only to allow Neanderthal Man to become extinct.  And finally, after billions of years, God finally decides to create Man.  If this is what Colson has proved, is it really what he wanted to prove?  Did Colson want to prove that God chose a bizarre method of creation that looks extremely like evolution? And does Colson's Creation story resemble Genesis?<br />As I noted, the fact that Colson side-steps the Young-Earth/Old-Earth issue, and this leads me to believe he doesn't want to directly criticize the Old-Earthian Christians - a significant portion of his audience. Yet Colson is indirectly showing that science clearly disputes a Young-Earthian Creation story.<br />When talking to Darwinists, Young-Earthians and Old-Earthians try to present a united front.  But amongst themselves, they greatly disagree with each other.  Young-Earthians contend that the Old-Earthians don't present a God consistent with the Bible. But Old-Earthians accept that there is overwhelming evidence of the universe being quite ancient and contend that some of Genesis is to be taken allegorically.  Therefore, they contend that the six days of Creation are not six literal Earth days.  But the Young-Earthians are right in the fact that the Old-Earthian Creation story - the Creation story as presented by Colson - bears utterly no resemblance to the Genesis account.  At very best, Colson can claim to have proved some other God and not the Christian God created the universe!  You don't even have to be an evolutionist to see that the Old-Earthians and the Young-Earthians effectively disprove each other.<br />I did want to touch upon Colson's &quot;us vs. them&quot; approach.  Many Christians, including Colson, see themselves as warriers against the evil, naturalist philosophy being thrust upon society.  The framework of the book is always the &quot;Christian warrier&quot; framework.  And this approach is used even in the areas of the book not about Creationism.  But the only way he can make this &quot;us vs. them&quot; approach work is to side-step significant issues such as whether Genesis is literal or figurative.	2001-07-04

I also found the discussion of the principles of evolution and the scientific case for it to be excellent.  However, I was less impressed with Pennock's philosophical discussions.<br />Pennock uses a few short pages in order to present a case for finding common ground between evolutionists and creationists.  My perspective is that I find the strenth of the argument for evolution to be strong, but like a Creationist, I fear that Darwinism leads to a loss of meaning of life and morals.  I found Pennock's attempts to dispell such fears and find common ground lacking.<br />Pennock argues that while evolution may show that God isn't required for Man's presense on Earth, it doesn't prove God doesn't exist.  Pennock says that there can be other reasons to believe in God, yet he doesn't offer any.<br />Pennock begrudgingly admits that darwinism makes it easier to be an athiest.  Without evolution, there isn't another acceptable theory for the existance of Man except creationism.  But while Pennock admits that darwinism makes it easier to be an athiest, he seems to deny that it makes it harder to be a Christian.  But clearly, if there is no particular requirement for God to exist, there is less reason to believe He does exist.<br />Pennock argues that even if Darwinism does lead to athiesm, that does not directly lead to a loss of meaning or morals.  He argues that a Christian knows that God would not order someone to create mass murder.  The fact that we know this is evil and therefore God would not order it implies that the concepts of good and moral exist apart from God.  Therefore, even someone who believes in God should see that God does things because they are good and moral rather than God makes them good and moral.  However, even if this were true in the case of such seemingly obvious moral choices, I believe that there are moral choices that are beyond Man's ability to truly decide.For example, the issue of animal experimentation.  Seemingly moral arguments can be made on both sides.  Who is to say which is right if there is no God to say which is right?<br />And even in the seemingly obvious moral issues, it isn't as obvious as Pennock would lead us to believe.  I agree that the vast majority of people would immediatly argue that Hitler's attempts to exterminate the Jews was immoral.  But there are still at least a small minority of people who would argue that it was a great idea and we should finish the job.  So seemingly obvious moral choices aren't universal.<br />But why do most people see Hitler as immoral?  I believe Pennock would argue that shows the inherit immorality of Hitler's actions.  Or, is it simply immoral because we've all been told it is immoral?  &quot;It is immoral because it is immoral,&quot; a &quot;vacuous tautology&quot; as Pennock would say?  And that the only way for it to not be a &quot;vacuous tautology&quot; is for God to say it is not a vacuous tautolgy and it is immoral because God commands it is immoral?<br />Finally, Pennock argues that even if you choose to believe that Darwinism leads to the conclusion that the universe is meaningless, that does not mean one could not choose to find meaning in their lives, family, and friends.  In other words, Pennock offers &quot;acting as if&quot; life has meaning is a satisfactory substitute for it actually having meaning.  Well, I respectfully disagree with this assessment.<br />In conclusion, I found it a powerful book, at least scientifically.  So I have to recommend the book even if I disagree with the authors philosophical arguments.	2001-04-04

I consider it to be a superior work as it had more statitics  and references.  This book often feel like you're reading the same chapter  again and again.  She would go into various types of slaughterhouses, such  as pig, cow, even horse.  And the story she would tell may differ in the  details, but still be basically the same.<br />One thing that I did find  intersting is that while I was aware that horsemeat is sold in other  countries, I did not know that we export significant quantities of it.  If  you haven't read any other work on the meat industry, then you need to read  this one.  If you've read some others, you can probably skip this one.	2000-09-07
