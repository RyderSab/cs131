All this books 'flaws' (non linear, lack of information) only make it more realistic and scarier. Even scarier is that this world could become real. Thankfully, we are not facing a declining population, but just the opposite, which could be an equal hazard. If such a wotld became real today, it would center on children rather than women, as today much political talk is of &quot;protecting the children.&quot; This book could save America by warning us of what could happen if rights are not protected and people do no take interest in the government.<br />The book is well written and has as much literary value as historical value.	2000-09-28

The part in  the middle was boring because it had too many details and two many repeated  concern. The whole transition between the war with the Phychlos(1 - 400)  and the war with the other species in the galaxy (7?? - 1050) could have  been cut or very shortened. The first war could be book 1 and the second  war could be book 2 and the esablishment of the government of earth could  be shortened and put into book 2. The Brown Limper Staffor subplot was good  but seemed irrelevent to the whole story. It would have been really neat if  'book 1' and 'book 2' were released and then the Brown Limper Staffor  subplot was released as a third book between 1 and 2. Like &quot;Shadow of  the Empire&quot; was a story between &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; and  &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;<br />Anyway, most of the book was really  exciting and worth the time it took to read. It had a comical aspect in  some scenes. Hubbard's religious beliefs showed once in a while in the  book, such as when he said something like tolneps evolved from whales or  something. The characters were somewhat unidimensional though. The words  &quot;Jonnie missed Chrissie&quot; or &quot;Jonnie worried about  Chrissie&quot; were thrown around so often that I started to dislike  Chrissie. Chrissie was so shallow and annoying that you wonder how Jonnie  could possibly like her. Sir Robert &quot;the fox&quot; was not explained  and It's hard to tell why he was so great or why he had to be such an  important character in the book. So in short, I liked the story enough to  give 4 stars, but some of the characters were in need of delousing because  they were lousy. HA HA	2000-09-10

The author uses Kilgore Trout who he uses also in Timequake, but in &quot;Breakfast&quot;  Trout seems to fit in the story more and the story is more planned and  assembled for this earlier work. But the Trout in this one and Timequake  are both in different universes of the author's invention because trout die  in 1981 in this book but he is alive for the timequake in the 90's.<br />I  like the idea that all characters, major and minor, have equal impact on  the story. The cast of characters makes the story simultaneously funny and  sad.<br />As for the content: I am totally against censorship and  politically corectedness, but being a member of the generation that follows  'X', my brainwashed mind could not help but cringe at some of the phrases  used. Never mind that, though. Everything, the language, the drawings,  everything in the book worked artfully.	2000-07-29

Cambell Jr.'s story	This is the second book I've read by Vonnegut(after the exceptional Cat's Cradle) and Vonnegut proves his superior ability to create complicated characters. After finishing the book, I still have no Idea if Cambell was a real person or not. (I don't think so, but the author made him feel like a  real person.) My only complaint is that the plot was never clearly defined  and it constantly shifted in time. But other than slight lack of  focus(which works in a way since it is the last written words of a probably  soon to be convicted war criminal possibly about to be hanged, making the  story all the more realistic.) Overall this was a great book with all  issues such as morality and responsibility. In fact, I loved the idea that  a man working as a spy could serve the side he is spying on far more than  he could ever serve the ones he is spying for... all unintentionally.  Vonnegut loads the story with humorous ironies also.	2000-03-17

Some of the jokes about Jerry Springer and Monica Lewinsky may prove to make the  book dated in the future but all of the other jokes that were obvious or  could easily be missed (a character curses and Barry says something like  &quot;they took a moment to think about this idea&quot; with the 'idea'  being the swear word.)

More others should write science fition that is unconventional and even for the particular genre, wholly strange. Most sci  fi is too interested in developing the details of the tchnology in use  (this sci-fi can be great too) than developing whatever it is that Dick  does develop. The characters in this book could use some work though, and  the book is not entirely focused. In fact, I wish he would have stuck with  the question of how a person from the future could live in the past and  it's current ideas knowing the major events to occur. Also, WHY DIDN'T JOE  USE THE UBIK SPRAY TO UNREGRESS THE UBIK BALM?  Oh well, just a minor  detail.	2000-03-06

School would  be so much fun (english &amp; history) if I could read everything as if I  were doing it to entertain myself and not because I have to. My state of  mind may have been the factor that made this one of the most exciting and  meaninful books I have ever read. <br />   Every politician should this to  learn what democracy is not. Not that I think such a regime could take over  in the near future with the freedom of speech on devices such as the  internet and the continous poplularity of books. But by not giving his tale  a date shows that such a world could come into being any time without  warning if people simply forget. The theme of the book is the answer to  anyone who asks what the purpose is of learning history. Montag is forced  to watch his wife and the rest of a doomed society as it repeats history  and mindlessly involves itself in war. The book is not so much about the  importance of books but the importance of knowledge. Bradbury shows that a  civilized society must always remember and cannot always be happy.<br />   The  second half reads like an action story without straying from the theme and  it is made obvious where Steven King was influenced to write the  unrecognized but I think great book The Running Man.	2000-02-23

I may have hated Ben Franklin's autobiography, but by loving this book so much it proves I have nothing against autobiograhies. I guess because you hear of Franklin so much and he lived so long ago you'd expect him to tell you something worth hearing. EVR, on the other hand, I had never heard of  before reading the book so I had no expectations whatsoever. Ed lived an  incredible life and even if only half of the book was true the same could  be said(some of the stuff he tells about is so fantastic that it sounds  like it can;t possibly be true - like survivin in a raft in the middle of  the ocean in the midst of WWII with no food or water for a month and living  to tell about it.) The best part was early on when he flew in WWI. Some of  his finncial whellings and dealings seem irrelevant, but they can be  skimmed with no loss to the story. His rise to success while remaining  basically a normal person is pretty inspirational. A must read.	2000-02-12

For those who complain of the smut in the series, the only  difference beween this and other works by Clarke is it is more implied in  the others. This was mostly science fiction. It successfully combines  physics, biology, chemistry, etc. True Clarke!	2000-01-23

I read this book over the summer and after trying numerous other King books, this is my favorite. Strangely, I seem to enjoy the ones written under the pseudonym Bachman more than others. Maybe because they are more  to the point and the alternate name allowed King more freedom,  phycologically and legally. It is not considered horror, but it is scary.  Read it, it's short.	2000-01-23
