In concert, bassist Phil Lesh often sparkled in his extended musical conversations with Jerry Garcia. Now, Lesh brings his intelligence and sensitivity to bear on the history of the seminal rock band.  Included in this memoir are some of the most vivid descriptions I have read of the Dead's long career: their wild cross-county rail tour of Canada, the comedy of errors that ruined their performance at Woodstock, and the tragic events at the infamous Altamont Speedway. Don't expect an all-inclusive story of either Phil or the band - he focuses mainly on their first ten years, and concludes the story with Jerry's death.  Youngsters like me who turned onto the Grateful Dead too late to experience them firsthand like to think that the Dead's story, and Garcia's legacy, is still going strong in the survivor's bands.  Lesh occassionally indulges in detailed descriptions of music and technology that might leave anybody but audiophiles and guitar players scratching their heads, but these are the rare frustrating moments in a heartfelt and readable book.	2005-06-08

Unfortunately, this book is nowhere near as well organized. The plates are small, the artwork is not as good, and not all the species are illustrated. The text was also rather thin in life history information. If you are traveling to the Caribbean in winter and aren't up to speed on North American migratory singbirds, you will need to take an Eastern U.S. bird guide with you as well, as the numerous migrants that comprise the wintertime fauna are merely mentioned. I managed to identify most birds that I saw while using this guide, but it was a frustrating process.	2003-01-02

In its pages you will find the many thousands of uses that numerous cultures have found for North American plants. From dubious cure-alls to modern cancer drugs, this guide describes them all, and their poisonous look alikes. If you already have Peterson's tree or wildflower guides, be prepared for a bit of Deja vu - there is considerable overlap in both text descriptions and illustrations. Also, don't set up your folk remedy pharmacy just yet - this book doesn't give dosage advice for the vast majority of species it describes. The authors are very strident in saying that this book is for information only, not clinical advice. That said, you will find innumerable fascinating tidbits of herbal lore between its covers.	2001-11-01

If you aren't careful, the lush descriptions and rich lore will enchant you into thinking this world is real. I sometimes have to pinch myself, remembering that Middle-earth is, after all, a world of imagination only. But what imagination! Still, I cannot recommend it unconditionally. The age-old criticism of this novel is that its conflict of good versus diabolical evil is too simplistic. Even if this is true, is this a flaw? Rather, it might be the most tragic aspect of Tolkien's tale - wouldn't we all rather live in an easy world of black and white distinctions, instead of our own unhappy, difficult and ambiguously gray world? That is why Middle-earth is so easy for people to love. Other notable criticisms are that Tolkien included no substantial female characters, and that dark-skinned characters are always on the side of evil. Truly, these are unfortunate anachronisms that mar an otherwise gorgeous story. Still, if you are able to willingly suspend your disbelief, you might find yourself enthralled by this epic masterpiece.	2001-08-29

If you are interested in reading about the pros and cons of different species, keep shopping.  This book covers species characteristics in an all-too-brief appendix.  Also, this book is mostly aimed at the hookbills - parrots, cockatoos, budgies, etc.  If you are interested in finches, mynahs, canaries and the like, you might find this book to be inadequate.  However,I found this book to be very useful when I first got my parrot, and I still peruse it from time to time, especially the sections on diagnosing illness and medical care.	2001-02-17

Ever think of doing something less than  civil to stop it?  If so, The Monkey Wrench Gang is your kind of  novel.  I couldn't stop laughing the first time I read it - the antiestablishment mayhem is nonstop, and Abbey's lush imagery makes you feel like a fifth member of the gang.  This is fun reading - it isn't great literature by any stretch.  Abbey was adept at puns and clever wordplay, but his characters are somewhat superficial and riddled with stereotypes.  But at the heart of this novel is Abbey's passion and sorrow for the Desert Southwest, a love that we can all begin to understand as we follow his motley band on their crusade to save the wilderness.	2001-02-17

Sometimes it is too hot, and we see nothing but the author's passion for the place he/she is describing.  Other times it is too cold, and the writing is merely a dull list of species descriptions and scientific concepts.  Weidensaul's book strides that narrow middle ground of being just right.  His chapters span the length of the Appalachians, covering topics as diverse as soil science and hawk migrations.  However, he never becomes bogged down in dry scientific writing: his love of the Appalachians resonates throughout the book.  In a country where most natural history writers turn their eyes west, Weidensaul's book is a much needed overview of an underappreciated mountain range.	2000-11-02

Heavily autobiographical and deeply  personal, these essays are not cheerful ramblings on the joy of communing  with nature.  They are bleak, lonely musings on the human condition.  Sometimes, Eisely's scholarly style gets the best of him - his penchant for  expounding upon the works of obscure authors taints some of his work with a  pompous air.  But his best moments more than make up for his bad ones.  Eiseley's universe can be profound, ethereal, and dreamlike. Life, Eisely  shows, is a journey of discovery filled with moments of awe, fear and  sorrow, and occasionally, even with moments of joy. His writings rekindle  our sense of wonder for a universe whose intricacies and secrets extend far  beyond the boundaries of human understanding.	2000-07-13

Volume 1 begins with an overview of various  aspects of observational astronomy, focusing on the various cataloging and  classification systems used to describe stars, nebulae, star clusters, and  galaxies.  The remainder of the three volumes consist of chapters for each  constellation.  Each chapter begins with a table that give a rundown of all  objects of interest in that constellation.  What follows are detailed  descriptions of all notable objects in the constellation.  Burnham did not  confine himself to scientific facts - religion, archaeology, literature,  and art all find their way into the text.  Time has had a toll on the  accuracy of the scientific facts that Burnham gives - many distances are  wrong, and the discussions of some objects, particulaly remote or highly  energetic ones, are seriously outdated.  Still, these three books form the  backbone of my astronomy library, and have grown battered with heavy use.   They make for fascinating reading both beside the telescope and in the  living room.	2000-06-15

With stars plotted down to 8th magnitude and just about every deep sky object withing the grasp of a typical amateur  telescope, the Sky Atlas will get you through years of deep-sky observing.   However, if you have a large telescope (greater than 12 inches or so) or  are a more seasoned amateur, you might want to invest in the more detailed  Uranometria 2000.  Sky Atlas 2000 comes with a clear plastic grid overlay  for getting exact coordinates (I wish it were made out of a more durable  plastic - mine has grown heavily scotch taped with use).  I would recommend  coating the pages of the altas with a waterproof map sealant (sold in  marine and backpacking stores).  Otherwise, frequent soakings by dew will  hasten wear and tear on the charts.	2000-06-15

Tired of buying those expensive dehydrated meals that turn out like soggy cardboard?  This book might just save you from the trail food  blahs.  It is full of interesting, ususual foods such as crab a la king and  polenta cakes.  The recipes are simple and trail smart (a few do require  weighty canned foods, though, and a few strike me as a bit too  time-consuming to be very practical).  This cookbook is mostly meat-free,  except for a few seafood dishes.  If you want dishes with meat, you might  want to take a look at the cookbook put out by the National Outdoor  Leadership School (NOLS).  A final word of warning: some ingredients can be  hard to find.  In putting them together, I have made trips to Middle  Eastern and Asian groceries, health food stores, and backpacking stores,  not to mention many of the large supermarkets in my area. Still, I have to  say that the results were worth the running around.	2000-06-13

This classic text of the environmental movememt has influenced groups as diverse as The Nature Conservancy, Greenpeace, and Earth First!  Devall and Sessions explore the emotional and spiritual underpinnings of hamanity's  ties to the earth in this deeply philosophical work.  They link a plethora  of sources in their exploration of Deep Ecology, including numerous  religions, the words of such notables as David Brower, Aldo Leopold, and  Edward Abbey, and the perspectives of many cultures.  Despite all of this,  though, I found it somewhat lacking.  Not present is the graceful beauty of  Aldo Leopold, nor the raw passion of John Muir.  Perhaps this book might  grow dog-eared with use in the library of a Philosophy Professor or a  career activist, but I suspect that most people, like me, will find this  book a bit dull.  Call me simpleminded, but I was more deeply moved by  Leopold's heartfelt musings on the chickadee in &quot;A Sand County  Almanac&quot; than by Devall and Sessions' philosophical ruminations.	2000-05-29

With environments as diverse as wavespept Pacific coasts, glaciated alpine country and lush  temperate rainforests, McNulty had his work cut out for him in capturing  the essence of the Olympic Mountains.  All in all, he has done an excellent  job, hitting on these topics, as well as the human  history and  conservation issues of the region.  I was disappointed with his coverage of  the rainforests, whose stunning grandeur really deserves more than the  brief chapter he gives them.  To his credit,though, he concludes the book  with an extensive bibliography that will satisfy anyone who wants to delve  deeper.  All in all, I would say that this book earns a home in the  backpack or suitcase of anybody who plans on visiting this wonderful  National Park.	2000-05-16

It is a refreshing change from sci-fi writers who simply toss around science vocabulary words, or rely on  worn-out cliches such as hyperdrive, teleporters, and wormholes.  In this  classic tale, Crichton uses his background knowledge to conjure an alien  microbe that infects the earth.  He follows the progress of the scientists  who study the Andromeda Strain...their discoveries about its nature...the  details of its structure...and it looks as though all the little details  will soon tie into a revelation about the Andromeda Strain...a microbe more  incredible and bizarre than any microscopic lifeform on earth...and then  the book comes abruptly to an end.  It would not have been much more  disappointing to end the story with, &quot;He woke up with a start, covered  with sweat.  And he realized it was all a bad dream.&quot;  This really is  a good book, and well worth the time to read it.  I was just expecting a  more creative, and more fulfilling, conclusion.	2000-04-20

It takes time, patience, and a keen eye.   Just looking at leaves is usually not enough to make a positive  identification.  Depending on the species and the time of year, you may  also have to examine bark, the twigs, flowers, buds, or fruits.  The best  part of the Peterson guide is that it has summer and winter keys in the  back - don't ignore them just because the keys have no pictures!  They are  invaluable.  Without them, you might find yourself lost among the many  pages of illustrations.  Perhaps the best resource to supplement this guide  would be contact with an expert on the flora of your area - perhaps a  naturalist at a local park or a forestry professor at a nearby university.	2000-04-15

Rey is best known for his &quot;Curious George&quot; stories, but he was a scientist by profession and he also wrote two books on stargazing for children.  If you have a child who is interested in the stars, this book is  delightful and highly readable.  And if YOU are interested in the stars,  dont hesitate to get it for yourself!  Rey has a unique way of showing the  constellations: he actually went through the trouble of drawing lines  between the stars of a constellation to form a meaningful picture - so  Gemini (the twins) actually looks like a pair of twins, Cetus (the whale)  looks like a whale, and so forth.  A word of warning:  to form these  pictures, Rey often had to rely on dim stars.  Don't expect to see them  from the city!  Access to a dark country sky is essential to get the most  out of this book.  That said, &quot;The Stars&quot;  makes the mastery of  stargazing accessible and fun for children and adults alike.	2000-04-08

Was McCandless an  irresponsible fool, a daring adventurer, or a devout truth seeker?  The  best part of Krakauer's book is that he lets you decide for yourself.  He  offers his personal insights into the reasons McCandless took up a life of  wandering, but largely lets the facts speak for themselves.  The book is  replete with excerpts from McCandless' journals and letters, as well as  accounts from the many people who encoundered McCandless during his  travels.	2000-04-08

Peterson uses ink drawings to show the important &quot;field marks&quot; for identifying species. The  downside to these drawings is that they tend to idealize the birds, showing  them in perfect postures and making the field marks more prominent than  they really are.  Many competitors, such as the Audubon Guide and the  Stokes Guide, use photographs instead.  Photographs give a more accurate  portrayal of the subtleties of color and pattern in plumage, but there are  always those poor shots in a photographic guide that are blurry or show the  bird at a bad angle.  Whether you decide that a guide based on drawings or  photographs is best for you, I would strongly suggest that you pick up an  audio recording of birdsongs, such as &quot;Birding by Ear,&quot; or the  &quot;Field Guide to Eastern/Central Bird Songs,&quot; both put out by  Peterson's.  As any experienced birder will tell you, the ear is just as  important as the eye, especially in summer, when birds are often hidden by  foliage.	2000-04-07

However, he died before his Magnum Opus was completed.   Although Darwin was not the first man to champion evolution, he was the  first to create a convincing argument for it.  This classic book thus  records the beginning of a huge paradigm shift in biology.  However, don't  expect a flawless, up-to-date discussion - much has changed about  evolutionary theory since Darwin's time.  To fill in the holes, you might  also want to read something more modern as a supplement. Richard Dawkin's  &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; would be an excellent choice.  Outdated  concepts aside, &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; puts forward an  ingeniously simple argument and backs it up with an enormous and varied set  of examples.  It is easy to see how this book was destined to shake the  foundations of science.	2000-04-07

Both revolve around Messiantic characters who upheave the societites they live in.  However,  Heinlein's novel is more lighthearted and humanizing than the often cold  and aloof style of &quot;Dune.&quot;  Many people have commented on the odd  medley of beliefs in Heinlein's novel: he espouses open sexuality,  communism, nudism, and religious tolerance, but compares women to  &quot;cherished housepets,&quot; and rails against the  &quot;wrongness&quot; and &quot;tragic inbetweenness&quot; of  homosexuality.  His views may seem contradictory, but after all, it was  written in 1961, when America was breaking away from old beliefs and  struggling for a new identity - a time, in other words, of many  contradictions.  &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; simply reflects  this transition from the family values and Red Scares of the Fifties to the  Flower Power of the Sixties.  Everybody, conservative or liberal, will find  something in this book that is personally offensive.  Read it anyway.  It  is a fascinating tale and an inciteful allegory.	2000-04-06

Although not as thin on laughs as its predecessor, &quot;So  Long and Thanks for All the Fish,&quot; this book doesn't have the nonstop  hilarity that made Adams a bestselling author.  My favorite gag in the book  centered on the Grebulons, a group of aliens that illustrates the evils of  excessive television viewing.  Still, I felt that the book mostly limped  along, finally reaching a dreary end.  I would have expected a series that  has given readers so many laughs over the years to have either a funny or a  poignant conclusion, but this tale has neither.  It felt as though Adams  was too tired of writing about his band of interstellar hitchhikers to give  them the denouement that they deserved.	2000-03-30

This is some of the most beautiful prose ever  written.  It is amazing to consider that Nabokov was not even a native  speaker of English.  What's more, he asserted that his novels written in  Russian, which never have been widely read in the West, were his best  books.

Still, since she is a very picturesque writer, I am willing to  forgive her.  Animal Dreams follows a year in the life of Codi Noline, a  disenchanted young woman trying to find her place in life, and finding it  in the last place she expects.  Certainly, it is not the most original  theme, but Kingsolver executes it well, with a vivid blend of dreams and  emotional storytelling.  My favorite character in the book was Homer,  Codi's withdrawn, emotionally repressed father whose mind deteriorates from  Altzheimer's Disease through the course of the novel.  I would venture to  guess that women would be more likely to enjoy this book, but I, for one,  thought it was pretty good.	2000-03-30

Anthony Burgess himself was chagrined that this book became his best known novel, its fame assured by Stanley  Kubrick's film adaptation.  The book has an imaginative first-person  writing style that is replete with a slang built mostly from Russian words.   This edition contains a twenty-first chapter that had  been removed from  the first American edition of the book.  In his introduction, Burgess rails  bitterly against this omission, but I have to say that I agree with the  American editor.  Chapter 21 transforms the book from a disturbing vision  of the future into an overly simplistic allegory on human nature.  Burgess'  message?  That the urge to violence and destruction is natural and  unavoidable among the youth of a decaying society, but they'll grow out of  it and become productive, nurturing adults (I guess Burgess forgot about  such grownups as Hitler and Stalin).  It is an oddly weak note on which to  end one of the most forceful and disturbing novellas of the 20th century.	2000-03-30

Unfortunately, Manes makes no convincing arguments on behalf of radical environmentalism in this tedious diatribe.  Instead, he simply spouts empty  rhetoric and a few conspiracy theories.  Manes emphasizes his contention  that civilization is on the brink of collapse due to our violent attitude  toward nature.  Do we need to change our attitude toward nature?  Well, I  think so.  Will Manes' book convince anybody of this?  I doubt it.  If you  want to read a good book about the Earth First! movement, read  &quot;Confessions of an Eco-Warrior,&quot; a homey but surprisingly  articulate collection of essays by Dave Foreman, an on-again, off-again  proponent of radicalism.
