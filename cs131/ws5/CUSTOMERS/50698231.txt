Though I'm sympathetic to Tolley's overall message, and he does manage a pithy, original remark here and there, it doesn't seem like this book was edited at all...like the author's manuscript was rushed to print \\"as is\\".  If Tolley wanted to just be the editor/compiler of a book of pithy quotes, he should have done that instead of writing this book.  As it was, his writing style reminds me a good deal of my own writing style when I was an *undergraduate* and hadn't yet found my own voice and relied excessively on copius, lengthy quotes from other people.  What's all the more embarassing is that Tolley is reputedly an attorney...I sincerely hopes he edits his legal briefs with more care and concern than he gave to this book!  I know Tolley's aim was to be \\"lighthearted and fun\\", but this is no excuse for sloppiness, especially for a topic so important. <br />It's too repetitive, and this is actually quite jarring to the casual reader...you look around the page bewildered and say \\"wait, didn't I just read that already??!\\"...Perhaps Tolley's intent was emphasis, but ironically, it comes across like someone reciting catcheisms or...bible verses.  I'm afraid I really can't recommend this volume to other readers, regardless how sympathetic I am to its overall message.	2005-05-01

This book comes with a forward by Neil Postman, who is an excellent, sensitive, and insightful author.  Sadly, Wood himself  just doesn't measure up to the greatness of Neil Postman.  The academic or lay reader would do much better in picking up Postman's own _Technopoly_ and going from there.  Finding references in the index to Michael Novak and Peggy Noonan, my initial enthusiasm for the book dropped like a rock.  Although he raises a few good points here and there, there are other authors who raise them more coherently and are more free of ....  Neil Postman once advocated that critical readers learn to develop an internal \\"... detector\\" when they read.  Well, my ... detector was going off left and right as I plowed through Wood's text, I'm sad to say.  Some authors I'd recommend INSTEAD of Wood include historian David F. Noble, Richard A. Brosio, Noam Chomsky, Kirkpatrick Sale, and especially Theodore Roszack's _The Cult of Information_ which is almost on the same par with Postman's outstanding best work,_Technopoly_.<br />There is a knee-jerk resistance to socialist, left-progressive critiques and insights about political economy all through out this book, and it maintains what seems to me a shockingly naive & plucky \\"Libertarian\\" (e.g. in the political party sense rather than philosophical sense) tone all throughout that is extremely grating.  Some of Wood's \\"suggestions\\" at the end of the book are praiseworthy, but many of them are completely undermined by some of the other suggestions raised by Wood (a chronic problem of many liberals, which is why I opt for left-radicalism personally).  Still other suggestions made by Wood are just plain awful or stupid or both.  Wood either has no comprehension of the real nature of power or is very self-deluded about it.  Much of the work reads not unlike Walter Lippman from the 1920s, and it's hard to say, reading some passages, if Wood really believes in democracy at all; His mood displays an overall defeatist outlook than one of real moral  outrage...there is even a hint of smug elitism in parts of the text.  All in all, this is a well meaning but very muddled book and will confuse the lay reader more than help him/her.  It's mostly a waste of time.  Other authors have said the best of what Wood has to say much better than he.<br />To be fair, the text IS somewhat dated, too, so Wood's gushing on about \\"telecommuting\\" and \\"distance ed\\" sound REALLY naive in today's world.  These early \\"promises\\" of the early 1990s have borne mixed and often rotten fruit in our day.  Read David F. Noble's _Digital Diploma Mills_ (2002) for contrast and see what I mean.	2002-08-15

Lipsitz very much continues the conversation begun by Berube in _Public Access_ and Cary Nelson, et. al. in their probing work on the exciting emergence of &quot;Cultural Studies&quot; in Higher Education.<BR>&quot;American Studies&quot; as described by Lipsitz here is basically CultStud informed by US cultural/social/political history and <BR>literature.  It is very engaging reading, especially the chapters <BR>on the legacies of the 1930s, 1960s, and 1980s (and the ideological uses of a distorted IMAGE of the 1960s by Reagan/Thatcher Neoconservatives in the 1980s down to the present<BR>day, which Lipsitz documents and condemns persuasively throughout<BR>his book).  The book explores the ongoing, changing myths/images that ask &quot;what is/are&quot; the thing(s) that make up this cultural entity we call the US of A.

I am a graduate student pursuing my MLS at the University of North Texas and have read this book in the course of doing personal research for a final paper; I would recommend this book especially to other library students like myself and working librarians &amp; library directors...We LIS people have a lot to learn from the field of Communications, especially from this author, Herbert I. Schiller.  Schiller writes eloquently and with passion, and if you like Noam Chomsky's political writings, you will LOVE Herbert I. Schiller.  Sadly, I read elsewhere on amazon.com that Schiller passed away in 2000.  This is a great loss, but others will, indeed must, carry on where he left off.<BR>Although this book was completed in 1996, it is still just as relevant in 2001, particularly with the &quot;war fever&quot; infecting this country en masse.  Schiller cuts through rhetorical PR-BS and gives you the straight dope.  This is REAL media criticism and it puts theory-intoxicated wankers like Jean Baudrillard et. al. to shame.  PoMo criticism of media is seriously deficient, and Terry Eagleton &amp; Christopher Norris have demonstrated elsewhere why this is so.  Herbert I. Schiller's writings on media embodies the critical edge and sober re-recognition of the nature of real existing capitalism in the so-called &quot;Information Age&quot;.

Socrates viewed the traditional Greek religion as superstition and full of irrational tales edifying to no one.  Hence SOCRATES conceived of PHILOSPHY as a counterweight to religion and myth.

His _Intro to Literary Theory_ is amazingly lucid and influenced me a great deal.<br />I was first exposed to PoMo while working on an MA in German Studies @ Rice University.  It was a subject I  had never before confronted in my undergrad years. I walked into my first Intro to PoMo class a naive optimist and humanist and naive beliver in the Enlightenment tradition.  Needless to say I was thrown for a heavy loop...PoMo utterly overwhelmed me,  scrambled my brains, and in no small measure derailed my MA thesis for at least a year, trying to wrap my mind around this difficult subject.  I felt a gut-level dislike of J.F. Lyotard and an immediate affinity for J. Habermas.  Among PoMo writers, I felt most attracted to F. Jameson, who, of whom, of course, we got the least coverage in my class.<br />In many ways, Eagleton picks up where Jameson leaves off.  Both are conscientious Marxist theorists who offer a welcome critque of PoMo from a Leftist perspective that I can embrace as opposed to the usual gamut of Right-Wing/Conservative PoMo bashing ala Alan Bloom, et. al. that I only partially  can stomach and tends to leave me cold.  In defense of PoMo's positive aspects, I highly  recommend the writings of US Professors Michael Berube and Cary Nelson.<br />But Eagleton is a mint...a unabashed socialist from Britain, a true cultural heir of Orwell, I think...He and fellow Briton Christopher Norris both offer solid, fair critques of PoMo free of  Rightist blather.<br />Eagleton gives the best of PoMo its due, but also takes it to task time and time again, often quite humorously with intellectual irony.<br />I recall reading _Teach Yourself Postmodernism_ and enjoying its solid critques of the failings of (classical) Modernism, but then it wandered off into advanced PoMo and I found myself dismayed,  watching my sympthies dry up and evaporate as the elucidation of PoMo drifted from Modernist critque to positive assertions about PoMo that struck me as so wrong-headed.  Eagleton points out in detail and says more eloquently than I could muster, just what is &quot;wrong w/ PoMo&quot;... (Norris does an equally fine job, too, i might add).<br />Eagleton in a number of ways reminds me of Noam Chomsky's  response to PoMo.  But whereas Chomsky is utterly dismissive of PoMo, Eagleton at least engages it forwardly, gives it a fair hearing.<br />Anyhow...This latest book by Terry Eagleton, it has much to recommend it.

It filled me with righteous anger and indignation, but that's a good thing. I was not impressed by any of the rebuttals I have read thusfar, neither here on Amazon.com nor the on-line article quoted by another reviewer here.  Some of the deunciations are so shrill I wondered aloud if the people who wrote them actually READ the book.  Or if they did read it, they certainly didn't read it carefully enough.  Barbara Quint writes, in the off-Amazon/on-article referenced by another reviewer: &quot;Content matters, not format.&quot;  Oh?  Anyone for a copy of the New Testament on toilet paper then?  Ms. Quint then amends that assertion with the caveat: &quot;Format only matters when it affects the endurance and transmission of content.&quot;  Ah, but that precisely is Mr. Baker's point.  These anti-bound-paper-volume &quot;techno{quick}fixes&quot; DO, repeat DO affect 'transmission of content', microfilm as well as digitization.  That Ms. Quint acknowledges as much but again repeats, religious like, her mantra &quot;Content matters, not format. Format only matters when it affects the endurance and transmission of content.&quot; (she writes it verbaitum x2) is more than a little eerie.  <br />No, I haven't earned my MLS yet; I hold an MA in German Lit, but it is sneering and elitist to assert no one has a right to comment on library practices that doesn't hold an MLS.  Nonsense. (But better to listen to someone with an MLS than the increasingly ubiquitous &quot;MS in INFORMATION SCIENCE&quot;, I might add).<br />Space problems?  Fine, lobby to build an annex.  Rent warehouse space.  Baker demonstrates over and over that the reason such a common-sense solution is so often discounted outright by library administrators has nothing to do with real cost-benefits (the techno-fixes are themselves outrageously expensive--ah, but there's always the seductive siren call of &quot;grant money&quot;, isn't there? Always that technological faustian pact...) or reason or logic but IDEOLOGY, pure and simple.  A particularly AMERICAN (Modernist) Ideology of &quot;Better living through Technology&quot; that was at its height from the end of WW2 up to the &quot;rational planning&quot; of the Vietnam War a la MacNamara and other US &quot;Best and Brightest&quot;.  Baker focuses on the effect of this quirky American Ideology upon the library world. The results are not pretty.<br />I always, in my youth, enjoyed looking through &quot;bound periodicals&quot;, such as old editions of LIFE and TIME from the 1940s and 1950s.  But before reading DOUBLE FOLD, I will confess ignorance that I never realized that BOUND PERIODICALS of NEWSPAPERS actually EXISTED before!  I have only ever dealt with microfilm in my experience using Public and University Libraries (point of reference: I was born in 1971).  I am mute with rage at the loss of these primary sources.  I applaud Baker's one-man effort to save as much as he could of the British Library's abandoned collection out of his own personal funds.  <br />These collective turn of events seem like a gigantic step BACKWARD for librarianship, though...that an individual like Baker has to step forward and create a private collection a-la Ben Franklin and the Founding Fathers, because Public Libraries simply can't be trusted anymore to properly care for these materials!!  Ok, that's an exaggeration (knock on wood), but the thought does come disturbingly to mind upon finishing Baker's book.  The secrecy, the lack of patron input, the sheer arrogance with which these techno-fixes are implemented, is probably what galls me the most.  Regarding a debate over digitalization, Baker notes in the case of one particular academic Library that, in the opinion of the Powers-that-Be: &quot;Although resistence is expected, especially from the humanities faculty...most [library managers] were in agreement that the [project] should go forward.&quot;  If our libraries (Academic and Public) are truly public institutions, shouldn't the Public have some say in this?  Apparently not, according to some of the LOC's past leadership!!  ...What utter contempt this shows for democracy, I say.<br />Bravo for the &quot;resisting&quot; humanities faculty, I say.  One thing I found remarkable is how so many of these key players Baker singles out for indictment were from Natural Sciences/Engineering backgrounds, etc.  Not a one of them true humanist scholars or people with traditional librarianship backgrounds.  It's something to keep in mind.  <br />If you liked this book, let me toss out some more authors' names to look out for:  Clifford Stoll, Kirkpatrick Sale, Theodore Roszack, and in particular the following librarian authors: Michael Gorman, Walt Crawford, Sanford Berman, and Earl Lee.<br />I plan to start my MLS this Fall of 2001.  I am a humanist scholar already (MA, German Lit.).  I can see that I go there not only to learn but also to FIGHT.<br />Bravo, Nicholson Baker!  And thank you for re-kindling my firey enthusiasm to leave corporate America once and for all and join the library profession.	2001-05-27

I'm not a librarian but my mom is, and I'm about to start working on my MLS.  We both had a good laugh w/ this book.<br />The section on &quot;stupid reference questions&quot; made me howl. I pray I will be able to keep a straight face if I ever end up working in Reference.  May end up choosing cataloging from the get-go!  The 10 stages were funny, if a little depressing.<br />Think of Matt Groening's &quot;Life is Hell&quot;, focused on Librarianship.  That's pretty much the kind of book you have here.	2001-05-22

This book was a thorougly enjoyable read, I literally could not put it down.  Earl Lee argues forcefully and convincingly, the essays are mostly very intellectually satisfying.  The only thing that prevents me from giving the book 5 stars is Lee's tendency to slide into humorous anecdote a little TOO much, causing some of the later essays to lose their focus and effectiveness.  I wish Mr. Lee would eventually go into Library Science education...I'd LOVE to take a class from him!

Frankly, I'm more impressed with Bertrand Russell's _Why I am not a Christian_ than with this book...Shelley's writing is couched in such period rhetoric (early 19th century / late 18th century style) as to be rather clumsy and turgid for the modern reader, and the assumtions and argumentation rely on premises that are often faulty or no longer seem valid in the contemporary world.<br />All that having been said, the short essay &quot;On Life&quot; was most impressive indeed and in many ways seems a foreshadowing of Postmodernism.  Very startling to see that Urquelle in a text like this.<br />This book looks great on a bookshelf, but is a little dissapointing in the actual reading of it, save for &quot;On Life&quot;.

I thought it was interesting that the term &quot;Metaphysical Poets&quot; was never used contemporaneously with these poets and their poems, but rather the term is a collective afterthought, coined centuries later...and, it was initially meant as an insult to this type of poetry by those reacting against it in later styles.  (Not unlike the story behind the coining of the &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; in popular parlance--first created by the theory's detractors as a dismissive insult)...I have always been more of a prose novel and short fiction person myself, so poetry is inherently difficult and alien to me as a rule; But THESE poems are by far some of the most difficult verse I've ever tried to wrap my mind around.  Thank goodness for the copious line notation footnotes or I'd've been really lost.  I thought it ironic that my ex would think I'd like these poems--I'm pretty ANTI-metaphysical if anything; German Expressionism and Dada and Modernism in general are more up my alley...but be that as it may, these poems did grow on me over time.  After I gave back my ex-girfriend's copy I went ahead and ordered myself a copy at my local bookstore.  Still not really my cup of tea, but...ah well...worthy addition to my bookshelf at any rate.	2001-03-13

I am amazed at other reviews here that SLAM this collection of stories but praise his others...some reviewers complain about the mixing of fiction with non-fiction essays, etc.<br />I can only read such reviews in disbelief and ask myself &quot;are we reading the same author here?&quot;;  To me, this is vintage David Sedaris...he's just as darkly funny here as he is in _Me Talk Pretty One Day_, his latest work, which I've also read.  I just finished the abridged Audio version of _BARREL FEVER_ and found it just as enjoyable as his other works...all new material I'd never heard before, etc.  <br />I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would object to the mingling of fiction &amp; non-fiction here...David's autobiographical non-fiction is so completely weird and surreal it might as well be fiction...one hardly notices the difference.<br />David Sedaris is not for the faint hearted.  He IS funny, but he is also gritty, brutally realistic, sardonic and unsentimental. Only his sister Amy, who now has her own bizzare show on Comedy Central (_Strangers with Candy_) is probably more &quot;out there&quot; than David.  I love their collaborative work on these audiobook versions of his stories...including her contributions on this audiobook,_Barrel Fever_.<br />Sedaris' delivery is so deadpan and straightforward that you begin to believe even the most outrageous of his fictional stories MUST have autobiographical sources...of course people will stare at you if you're listening to this audiobook on a portable walkman and suddenly laugh out loud.  The point is, those people would STILL stare at you if they actually HEAR what you are laughing AT.  That's Sedaris' genius, in an nutshell.	2001-03-02

I agree, tone and ending of this book are a little dark, but so what?  I like my comedy and humor a little black anyway.<br />This book is still funny despite being somewhat morose and depressing...it is a fine Coda to the series, no matter what other reviewers here have said.<br />I bought this book while vacationing in the UK, it went on sale in Great Britain before the release of the American edition (of course), so I was quite lucky to get it ahead of everyone back home in the USA.<br />Besides, though this is probably the final book of this series, there's always the &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; series to turn to, which has its own rewards.<br />Despite the finality apparent in this book, never say never when it comes to Douglas Adams...there are plenty of ways he could still &quot;deus ex machina&quot; the series anew...if he wanted to.  I'm sure he doesn't, but you never know.  The workings of the infinite improbability drive should well have taught us that!<br />Speaking of, looking back, so much of Adams's work, including this novel, seems to have later inspired so much of the British series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.  Maybe there actually is a more concrete connection that I don't know about, since I'm not a UK citizen...but anyway...I wonder if Adams ever did any writing or consulting for &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;?  If not, he should have...does anyone know what Adams is up to these days at the Dawn of the 21st Century?	2001-02-24

The difference is that these creations ala Douglas Adams &amp; John Lloyd use already existing town names in the UK and re-define them to make them useful (and funny)...this is altogether different from American sniglets like &quot;bevemirage&quot; (the black plastic bottom of a liter bottle of dark cola that fools you temporarily into thinking there is more cola left in the bottle than there actually is), which tend to be creative word-fusions of already existing words. The only U.S. linguistic construction I can think of that comes close to what Lloyd and Adams are doing  here is the phrase &quot;in a New York Minute&quot;, aka &quot;really fast&quot;.  Though there is no collorary such as &quot;in a Topeka minute&quot; (or whatever) to mean slow, drawn out (but maybe there ought to be).

I heartily agree that &quot;Life is Hell&quot;, of which this book, _Love is Hell_, is part of that Genre, has got to be Matt Groenings' finest work.  Yes, the ubiquitous Simpsons have their moments, as does &quot;Futurama&quot;, but...anyway, I actually owned the original edition of this book and only comparatively recently sold it to a 2nd hand bookseller (D'oh!), which was a mistake because I only comparatively recently fell intensely into and painfully out of love with a too-hot-to-handle 22-year old woman from S. America...the book would have made a nicely sardonic &quot;St. Valentine's Day&quot; / &quot;Goodbye Forever&quot; parting gift.<br />Alas...I may actually buy the most recent edition, since from what I read here it has some added material from my original copy; More &quot;Love is Hell&quot;??--ooh, baby, gimme more!  Or I could just splurge and pick up &quot;The Big Book of Hell&quot; which has all the original &quot;Hell&quot; books (this one included) compiled under one complete cover.  I had to snicker when I saw under &quot;people who bought this title also bought titles by...&quot; and saw the name of David Sedaris!  Well, of course!  Anyone who appreciate's Matt's warped sense of humor and doesn't know about David Sedaris should do an Amazon.com search for &quot;Sedaris, David&quot;.  They are kindred spirits in the world of &quot;dark&quot; humor.  Love 'em both! Remember JP Sartre's dictum:  &quot;Hell is other People&quot;.

Anyway, I evetually found Enlightenment and am proudly, defiantly Leftist (and unabashedly Marxist) today.  Mr. Lind, by contrast, is a &quot;former conservative&quot; turned tepid centrist.  I welcome his polemic against the right, but he doesn't go far enough and he still has a lot of screwy ideas inherited from his former days on the Right.  There are plenty of much better Leftist critiques out there written by writers with far more conviction, passion and eloquence than this light-weight.  &quot;With friends like this...&quot; on the Left...who needs enemies?  Mr. Lind might meet the critera of &quot;Leftist&quot; vis a vis such mainstream national shows as Crossfire, but he's no Leftist in my book.  Just a tepid centrist with a bad conscience who has a lot more thinking and reading to do.  Read Jim Hightower or Molly Ivins, because Mr. Lind's centrist blather is a waste of time.	2001-01-29

I checked out this book from the library and was amazed how richly informative and caringly written it was...this book is indeed a mitzvah. I think the earlier reviewer's criticism of Ms. Diamant's supposed assertion that the principles she introduces do not apply to Orthodox conversions is a little misguided...I think Ms. Diamant is merely acknowledging her lack of expertise in Orthodox matters and prefers to defer to an actual authority on Orthodoxy rather than attempt to tackle that area herself...she is a born Jew but raised in a more liberal tradition.  But yes, the book provides spiritual enlightenment to all would-be converted Jews, be they ultimately Orthodox, Conservative, Reform or Reconstructionist.<br />I ultimately never made that leap, though I no longer really consider myself Christian anymore, either.  I agree w/ Judaism too much for that.  I guess i'm just a secular pagan Stoic, a friendly gentile w/ a deep admiration for Judaism and its traditions...and I'm probably too much the hellenic sensualist to fit the Jewish mold anyway.  But it was a very spiritually uplifiting experience, my close encounter with Judaism, and this book was a profound part of that experience.<br />Highly recommend it to anyone converting or who knows a friend or family member who is pondering conversion.	2001-01-29

He pulls no punches and strongly makes his case that (to him) the only real/authentic conversion to Judaism is the Orthodox conversion.  I found his arguments very convincing, and ultimately I guess I decided NOT to convert on account of this book.  Which is not to say I didn't enjoy reading it...I did, very much so.  I have been disillusioned by Christianity since early childhood and I was amazed just how &quot;Jewish&quot; my ways of thinking have been over the years.  I am adopted and sometimes I do wonder if maybe my birth mother wasn't really Jewish...I think the odds are strongly against it, but it might explain a lot about myself if it were true.  I enjoyed very much the testimonials of converts and their &quot;what I don't like about Christianity&quot; criticisms.  I found myself nodding in agreement more than once.<br />But I realized paradoxically that I agreed with Lamm's unspoken assertion that Orthodox conversion is the only real authentic route but also came to understand I could never have the self discipline to live up to Orthodoxy's stringent standards, either.<br />I used to joke to a friend who is converting under Reform auspices &quot;It's really too bad you can't convert to SECULAR Judaism&quot;, to which she responded with a laugh &quot;but honey you can, it's called REFORM!&quot;...we used to have some interesting arguements, since I started pondering conversion because of this friend.  I always found myself lining up with the Orthodox and Conservative interpretations while she always lined up with the Reform tradition.<br />I guess I'm too much of a hellenic sensualist, too much a pagan Stoic to fit the Orthodox-Jewish mold.  I guess I could always undergo and finish the rigours of Orthodox conversion, stay in an Orthodox synagogue for a year then see if I might want to change over to Conservative or Reform Judaism later...but that's just a little too intellectually dishonest, maybe.<br />I don't consider myself a Christian anymore, really...I agree with Judaism too much for that.  I still like Jesus, but don't much care for the institution of the Christian Church that came out of that tradition later.<br />Roman Stoicism tends to be my LEBENSPHILOSOPHIE for now. But I respect Rabbi Lamm's well-argued thesis.	2001-01-29

The narrator speaks in a soft Scottish brogue which is pleasing to the ear and lends a kind of JRR Tolkien-like atmosphere to all the stories...

Lutz's collaborative and individual efforts should be more widely known, especially among Left Intellectual circles, and that they aren't is quite a shame.<br />It's also a pity such an earthshattering book as this is now out of print, for it diagnoses the rot at the core of Classical Neoliberal economics so eloquently and plainly.  It is a strongly ethical critique that lays bare a critical mistake in the reasoning of Adam Smith...a mistake that has been siezed on by all subsequent Neo-liberal &quot;classical&quot; economists and is the only thing they care to remember about Adam Smith...It was joked once on NPR that Adam Smith couldn't get a job in todays' business press because he'd be percieved as &quot;too lefty&quot;.  This is actually quite true...if, as Noam Chomsky has pointed out, anyone would actually bother to mull thru the whole of Smith's works.  But no, what gets lached on to is the selfishness doctrine (Smith's Mistake) as the key economic engine, and all of Smith's moral reservations and other conscientious handwringing are forgotten/rendered mute by this mistake...and it is upon this mistake that the whole unjust real-existing capitalist world order has been built and continues to rest.  <br />&quot;So?&quot; you might say, &quot;Marx already did this in Das Kapital&quot;. Well, yes, but not quite.  Lux knows about Marx, of course, and has a few humanistic/ethical choice barbs to toss his way also.<br />Although Lux does not use this language to describe his position, his solution to the dilema does basically come from the anarcho-syndicalist circles of Spain (both during and even, covertly, AFTER the Spanish Civil War), plus a little Gandhi &amp; MLK thrown in for good measure.  That summary is a bit too pat, and it's hard to summarize briefly and still do the book justice; JUST READ IT.  You will never look at economics quite the same ever again.<br />All in all a fine book that has pride of place on my bookshelf. Worthconducting an &quot;out of print&quot; booksearch for, by all means.	2000-12-16

I *tried* to read this book when I was a German lit. graduate student at Rice U.  I'm a lot better read now than I was then, but it doesn't change my opinion that this book is well-nigh unreadable.  This book is strictly for professionals, post-PhD types...a scholarly book meant only for other scholars and NOT for the general reader! Nor, even, for most serious graduate students.  The only folks I can think of who might have the luxury to read this book (or gain much from doing so) are well-established PhD's with tenure.  I sold my copy in disgust to my local 1/2 Price Bookstore and it sat on their shelves for months and months...don't know if they ever sold it or just quietly got rid of it...       If you're a graduate student in any kind of Lit. program or Intellectual History program, do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's far too dense, too obtruse, and you have a lot better things to do with your time than try to scale these heights.  This book for me became emblematic of what I feel is the over-emphasis on THEORY THEORY THEORY at the expense of reading / appreciating / enjoying real, honest to God LITERATURE. Honestly, you're better off spending your time absorbing literary works DIRECTLY yourself than wading thru a theory tome like this one.  I'm not going to say theory isn't important, or that it can't sometimes be fun (Roland Barthes, Terry Eagleton, etc), BUT...well, this book definitely wasn't that...fun, I mean.  I'm sure this book is brilliant in its own way, as the other reviewer touches on...but...anyway, I remember being very put off and frustrated with this text!    &gt;&gt;NOTE: my admonition goes DOUBLE for any *undergraduates* who might consider picking this book up...Also, while I do read German, I only read this in translation I can't say if the original German version is any better.&lt;&lt;     I will close by advising this: Try to tackle the literary foothills and minor peaks first before tackling the literary Alps, or in the case of this book, the Himalayas / Mt.

I didn't read THE NEW RUSSIANS until a couple of years ago.  Both are excellent books but I enjoyed THE RUSSIANS more, I think.  Any student of Russia would do well to read this book even today...although it's no longer contemporary/current events it still captures like a snapshot the then-USSR in the late 70s, and even some discussion of the earlier times in people's memories then--Krushchev, Stalin, etc.  I found the book insightful and still relevant when I myself I finally visited Russia in 1993.

Not at all what I expected from a reporter writing for the Polish Press Agency during the Cold War days.  Kapuscinski acheives heights of journalistic excellence time and again. I expected Soviet-style propaganda puff-pieces and was startled over and over again by Kapucsinski's humane, non-dogmatic views and independent streak.<br />But more than that, he is a journalist with a poet's soul. His lyricism can be downright haunting...he has a rare gift when it comes to the printed word.  It is a poinant, sensitive lyricism I've found only among Polish and other East-Central European (mostly non-Russian Slavic) writers.  Don't know what it is, but it always enchants me...<br />...I mostly bought the book due to the author's own nationality and also for the section on Latin America, which was of primary interest to me, but since I was &quot;reading&quot; the book as an audiobook (therefore, listening to it)...I &quot;read&quot; it cover to cover.  Although it covered wars in Africa and other parts of the world that are of minimal interest to me, he made these events come alive, made me sit up and take notice, actually care about these things, these people, these events.<br />Kapucsinski's book makes an interesting contrast to PJ O'Rourke's _Holidays In Hell_, which I'll admit I did laugh at when listening, but O'Rourke's is a rather mean-spirited humor and unabashedly U.S. nationalistic/right-wing.  Kapucsinski is much more humane.	2000-12-06

They were part of the so-called McCollege Tour this past year and the brilliant student filmmakers (one of whom I met in person) were very well aquainted with Cary Nelson &amp; Michael Berube and their sharply critical books about the state of modern academia.  <br />Basically, a typical grad student's chances of landing a secure assistant professor's job at a major university is about the same as your typical college baseball player joining the major leagues after school...more than likely this person is going to stay in the minor leagues forever...translated to the academic analogy that means endless, untenured/temporary lecturer/instructor positions, jostling between several teaching gigs at different junior colleges, etc, living at near poverty level in the process.  The light Nelson sheds on this reveals injustices that are truly scandalous...and you thought public school teachers aren't paid enough! (They aren't--but compared to the peons of Higher Ed...)<br />I laughed very hard (and often bitterly) reading this book and got my monthly fix of moral indignation.  As someone who attended grad school at Rice University, I can definitely relate. The president of Rice recently issued a manifesto that essentially argued for running the university like a business.  Funny, I thought a university was an institution of higher learning, not a business...  Cary Nelson elucidates very effectively the coming prominence of the &quot;University, Inc.&quot; mentality among university administrators...	2000-11-25

I've read Kim Stanley Robinson's THE BLIND GEOMETER once before in a collection of short novellas by the author that I bought once while an exchange student in Germany (I was getting tired of reading Goethe and wanted to read something in my native English again for once).  THE BLIND GEOMETER is EXCELLENT. But the rest of Kim Stanley Robinson's stories I found abysmally bad.  I'm not sure if this book advertised here is the same one I read, however...I have yet to read any of his MARS books, though.  Maybe he's gotten better.	2000-11-01

I remember reading this book circa 1994 as a graduate student at Rice University.  It was very interesting, and I found Bruce Sterling's praise of librarians &amp; libraries and the importance of freedom of information very eloquent and uplifting.  Hans Moravec, on the other hand, I find to be one sick puppy and scary to boot.  He's most famous for wanting to be able to download his consciousness into a computer and attain &quot;virtual immortality&quot;.  Having read more recent works, such as Theodore Roszack's critical study _The Cult of Information_, I can see that Moravec's ideas are just idle fantasy now...probably never realizable.  David Brin also had some very sensitive, cautious words, which I deeply appreciated. I think this book was a rare convergence of librarians &amp; SF writers in the time of the early 90s when Cyberpunk was all the rage (it's not dead yet, but it's not as BIG as it was then, either) and it was easy to be giddy about technology, etc.  The internet was still young then.  I think we've learned a great deal more and are much more realistic now than when the summary of this conference was put together in book form...This book is now pretty much a historical document more than it is anything useful for a 21st century contemporary reader.	2000-10-30

Be forewarned.<br />As for the reviewer bemoaning the lack discussion of post-structuralist/20th Cen French lit.crit--peh, I was GLAD to be free of that jargon-laden, overly pretentious claptrap (that is anyway in so many respects a cheap/pale immitation of so much better, earlier GERMAN philosophy) for once.  I read this AFTER finishing an MA in German Lit wherein all that 20th Cen French lit.crit damn near ruined my appreciation/love of literature for good.  <br />This book was very much a breath of fresh air &amp; renewal from some very personally embittering experiences in the academic lit.crit realm.	2000-10-22

By now most of these essays are beginning to show their  age...I agree with the other reviewer here that her style is quaint.  I was most impressed with her ruminations on the craft of creative writing itself, and how that can come into conflict w/ the practice of history, and I enjoyed her reflections on doing historical research and also her considerations on academic vs. non-academic historians, and the importance of readability and narrative vs. cramming loads of facts into one's writing w/o a unifying narrative; British scholar A.L. Rowse makes a similar point (and praises Tuchman) in his _Historians I have known_.     After having read Ron David's _The Arabs &amp; Israel_ and a number of works by Noam Chomsky (themselves both American Jewish writers) critiquing modern Israel, I really cannot take Tuchman's triumphmentalist zeal vis a vis Israel seriously; I found myself talking back to the audiobook repeatedly &quot;but Barbara, what about...?&quot; , etc. Tuchman is a mainstream American liberal, and I am Left of the mainstream.  I have yet to read Tuchman's seminal work _The Guns of August_, and I am eager to read _The Proud Tower_ also, about the last years of the 19th century before the Great War.  You could do worse than Barbara Tuchman, but she is something of an anachronism by now and you can certainly do much better, too.  (Howard Zinn comes readily to mind)	2000-09-24

If you are unaquainted with Bulgakov or have never read his magnum opus, _Master &amp; Margarita_, do yourself a favor and read _Heart of A Dog_ FIRST.  If you like it, go on to _M&amp;M_.  If you DONT, go on to _M&amp;M_ anyway.  _Heart of A Dog_ is one of Bulgakov's earlier works, he was still developing as a writer when he wrote it.  _M&amp;M_ is shows him at his absolute best.  _Heart of A Dog_ is a good book in its own right, but it kind of suffers from standing in _M&amp;M_'s shadow, at least for me it did.	2000-09-24

The arduous production and defense of my Thesis left me  psychichally drained and had shattered my intellectual confidence  completely.  I turned to this book in the hope of performing what I like to  liken to a full &quot;cold&quot; systems re-boot on a computer...start over  from the very beginning and do a &quot;full check of all  systems&quot;...the book was a sheer joy to read, opened my eyes afresh to  new facets of philosphy I'd never considered before...such as the profound  humanism contained in Protagoras' &quot;Man is the measure of all  things&quot;.  I also appreciated Solomon &amp;  Higgins' offering of the  Philosophical olive branch to Psychology &amp; psychoanalysis, apparently  feeling that a practice of Philosophy which ignores the insights of  psychoanalysis, et. al. is so much the poorer for it.  Having just now  finished Peter Gay's _Freud: A Life for our Time_(1988), however, I think  it can be safely said that the real historical Freud would have rejected  this rapprochment (In terms of time-line, it wasn't the Philosophy who  rejected Freud so much as Freud who rejected as unsatisfactory the  condition of the contemporary state of Philosophy of his time and sought to  make Psychoanalysis a clear and distinct science, set apart from formal  academic Philosophy which Freud had already given up on)  But I think  subsequent events down to the present day make this suggested rapprochment  of Solomon &amp; Higgins correct and appropriate, and Freud deserves his  own seat in the canon of Western Philosophy.  (IMHO, Psychology without  Philosophical insight is itself vacuous) In any event, as a whole to book  restored my faith in Philosophy and led to a renewal and re-discovery of my  own intellectual confidence.<br />In a final note about the authors, I have  had the pleasure to listen to some of Prof. Robert Solomon's lectures via  audio cassette -- specifically a lecture series entitled &quot;No Excuses:  Existentialism and the Meaning of Life&quot;, produced for The Teaching  Company (TM).  I am happy to report that Dr. Solomon is just as engaging  &quot;live&quot; as he is in print. I look forward to listening to his  lecture series on Nietzsche which was done in collaboration with his  co-author, Prof. Higgins, also for The Teaching Company.	2000-08-03

When I first  read this book it was as an exchange student (4th year college student)  living in Germany, near the end of my 1 year stay, feeling especially  isolated socially, overwhelmed by intellectual Weltschmerz, and depressed  to the point of contemplating suicide.  I'm glad I picked up this book and  started reading it. Thankfully, Hesse's German prose reads lucidly and  easily, and I recommend the original to students of the language if only  for that. I so strongly identifed with the protagonist that I could not put  the book down, and I literally credit the book with saving my life...It  gave me comfort and hope, and gave me lots to think about.  I remember  reading the book later in English upon returning to my university's home  campus after that year abroad for a German lit class.  We did an  interesting character comparision between Harry Haller of Steppenwolf and  Josef K. from Kafka's The TRIAL.  I can't remember the particulars now but  the contrast of the two literary characters as an illumnation of the  phenomena(s) of Modernism was especially intellectually gratifying. I can  only hope the Spanish translation does it justice.	2000-07-04

I have to confess I really enjoyed reading this book, in a darkly comedic/carthitic way. But I also had to laugh at Sacks' obvious naivte in the initial section as well. I mean, assigning some of the seminal works of  Noam Chomsky to a Freshman Intro to Journalism course?  I love &amp; avidly  read Chomsky, but then I have an MA in German Studies from Rice University.  So I can certainly tell you that kind of material is best left to a  undergraduate Junior or Senior seminar! No small wonder that lesson went  over like a lead balloon in his freshman intro course...Teaching is like a  lot of things--truly excellent teachers make it look SOO EASY, when in fact  it's anything but.  Sacks' discussion of PoMo vs. Mo is a bit superficial,  but not wholly without merit, I'll allow.  He should do a bit more reading  on the shortcomings of classical MO, because PoMo is sometimes the  necessary corrective. Anyway,I myself taught High School German one year; I  too complained bitterly about my students at the time, but I also realize I  failed to connect with them; I can't blame my on my ex-students what is  more easily explained by my own inexperience and mistakes and poor planing  and execution--and neither can Sacks. Yes, like Sacks' students mine were  rude and inconsiderate, didn't share my passion for the subject matter,  etc. I know I treated my profs with deference &amp; respect, but my  clearest memories are of upper division courses filled with fellow academic  majors who WANTED to be there. Sacks is in the main describing survey  courses EVERYONE is compelled to take, so I'm not convinced his criticism  applies as widely as he thinks it does, though perhaps as a criticism of  the wisdom of compulsory survey courses in general he has something to say.   I am cautious to praise this book due to my own guilty conscience and  personal intellectual conceits &amp; vanities. Sacks' is at his best asking  important, thought-provoking questions, even if his own attempts at answers  do, I think, fall short of the mark.	2000-06-05
