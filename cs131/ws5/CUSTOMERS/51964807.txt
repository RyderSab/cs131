US	51964807	RQUEMA8Q96AZI	1400051908	703207753	The Rottweiler	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Excellent writing and story	I think the reviewers who have not liked this book have probably been die-hard mystery fans who are at a loss without a very clear, typical mystery-style plot.  This is an entirely different kind of book, with subtle and humorous insights into a complex and very realistic group of eccentric characters, Inez Ferry, owner of an apartment building with her antique store on the first floor, and her employees and tenants and a few others.  Mr. Khoury, the cranky jeweler, is a gem.  There is a sense of tension building but at a remove, as would happen in an area where young women were being found killed, but most people still felt safe, still went to work, still had their morning tea and their little schemes and machinations.  Then, small items the killer has taken from his victims begin appearing in the antique shop, and the danger seems perilously near.  Not, however, to those of incorrigibly criminal intent, who see opportunity in such situations.<br /><br />A well-imagined and well-written novel, with a few small, forgivable flaws.	2005-10-12

The editor explains in his introduction that he was looking for a new definition of plot, saying, among other things, \\"The story, then, is what the story is hiding, and the hide is indeed a piece of skin, whose effect is to conceal the body.\\"  Dude, what does that mean?

It's hilarious in places and will make you laugh out loud, as you must, to deal with the range of heartbreak, despair and desperate conniving Detective Conlon and his colleagues face daily.  I agree that a little editorial cutting, not much, would have helped in the family biography section, but that is mostly because I wanted to hear more about the author's experiences in day to day police work.  The book is very well-written.  The author is intelligent about and compassionate toward the characters with whom he comes into contact, and he provides an insider's perspective on historical events from the French Connection bust, to the Knapp Commission, to 9/11.    An unrelated aside:  I once asked a friend, who was a police detective in Brooklyn in the sixties and seventies, which of the 70's cop shows was the most realistic.  To my surprise, he said Barney Miller, a sit-com some of you might remember.  Although the rest of us think of police work as grueling, dangerous, daredevil-type work, it's actually grueling, dangerous, daredevil-type work for people with a sense of humor and the patience to listen to endless self-justifications and excuses and then spend the night wading through hours of paperwork.  Detective Conlon provides excellent descriptions of the job, the camaraderie, the informants and the \\"perps.\\"	2005-01-15

It's worth reading for enjoyment, sociology, a breathlessly fast writing style, and plain fun.  No, it's not for everybody.  No, it's not a timeless classic of fine literature.  But yes it defined and even helped create the time.  It doesn't matter what your age is, but it will appeal more to the young at heart.  It offers appealing portraits of important Beat poets and characters such as Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and others.

A lot of it consisted of how the author got through the revolution by playing along but being subversive in her home (she had satellite TV and a reading group).  She may well be daring for an Iranian intellectual, and certainly people were killed in those days, but she is still a bookish woman trying to get along, and she writes with a bookish distance that doesn't make for an exciting memoir.  Even when she is writing about reading during bombing attacks.  If you have read the books she discusses, and are inclined toward reading about them, you should probably read the book for that reason.  For me, the most interesting part was the reactions of her reading group, other students and Islamic radicals to Western classics.	2004-08-28

It's evocative of the time and place, and the thoughts of Dylan Ebdus, the only white boy in Fort Greene, but the pages and pages of bleak recounting of Dylan's trials were just plodding.  I skimmed in places.  The end is also predictably bleak, and without a cohesive story line.  By the end, it's just a tale of what happened to the white boy, and what happened to the black boy, without surprises, really.  The magic ring device didn't make any sense.  Having said that, the descriptions can be wonderful, and accurate, down to the sidewalk chants of the children.  But don't read it with great expectations.	2004-08-24

This book was shallow and unbelievable, going for a kind of magical realism, but falling flat.  The main character tries to teach his dog to talk, after his wife kills herself, in the hope that the dog will shed (no pun intended) some light on his wife's death.  But even the character's reactions to the suicide and bereavement were not convincing.  Shallow, and the subplot of lunatics who believe dogs can be surgically altered to talk, was not well-enough developed, or compelling in the least.

Precise and evocative, it's more like a cool drink of water on a quiet country afternoon, than the usual, breathless books on creativity that push you to produce, produce, produce.  Here the focus is not on squeezing your mind for ideas, but on the quiet observation of oneself and life, and the exact origin of those mysteries we call inspiration, block, connection, as well as exercises to encourage us to trust our inspirations and see through the places we are blocked.  It's about trusting yourself rather than about pushing for ideas.  <br />All the pushing--it's as if to say that you can be creative and not necessarily have it change the rest of your life.  There is the problem of the artist or writer who drinks or uses drugs, perhaps to avoid confronting the need for change.  This book is holistic:  &quot;...make a choice about what's important, and... let go of all the rest,&quot; Loori says (p. 154) in the section about simplicity.  When you think about all the pressures that keep us from our creative selves, all the things we think we need that cost time and money, create worries that disturb our minds and block our creative output or influence our work for the worse, when the real problem requires that we go deeper and identify the changes we need to make, even begin to make them with Loori's gentle and persuasive support.  You will sense him there, offering himself as guide, and offering his experiences of raising a family, changing career from scientist to photographer to Zen master, founding a monastery where thousands of people have gone for retreats on Zen and Zen arts.  <br />A work of art itself, The Zen of Creativity also has beautiful black and white illustrations that are used as examples.  If you are willing to slow down and take a close look at your mind and at your artistic process, then I think you will really enjoy this book.	2004-06-25

I agree that this is a graduate level course in one book, and I think the reader who wanted to give it zero stars was probably over her head.  It is brilliant, philosophical and witty, as no doubt the author is also, but it is not an easy read memoir.  Although there are elements of memoir, it's really a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a literary writer.  Yes, these -- the problem of the double in myth and literature, the demonic/godlike sources of inspiration, the moral responsibilities of the artist, the meaning of the book as go-between of author and reader, and the different historical answers to all of the above -- these are the thoughts that occupy this writer.

I find Auster's ideas interesting, but his execution plods a litle.  I didn't find this book to be brilliant, but it was capably done, a little melodramatic in content, but I think authors are all killing themselves to sell books these days.  I think the reader is well advised to consider this book in that light:  as a product.  Like a suspense movie without the suspense, for example.  It's nothing particularly special or enlightening, but if you are looking for something interesting to read, it will do.  It won't disappoint unless you are looking for something to transform your life or knock your socks off.  For transformation, read Nabokov.

I didn't realize how much this book affected me until I started having dreams about blue people.  That's the species bioengineered to replace us.  The slowly unfolding explanations in the book make it creepier and creepier, and, as other reviewers have noted, not that far from possible.  It was a great read, I couldn't put it down, and afterward, couldn't get it out of my mind, from the despair of the one surviving human, Snowman, to the horror of the predatory pigoons, a bioengineered animal, which stalk Snowman at one point.

Although she starts with an interesting idea, denizens of Los Angeles fiddling while the city burns, she doesn't realize it nearly fully enough.  The whole book suffers from a flippant, shallow narrative voice and lack of imagination, not to mention poor taste and judgment in construction.  Most of the book is a dull, unoriginal chronicle of women's disappointments with men.  In the last few pages, the characters live through nuclear war, but not even that seems to get a rise out of them.  This book was not worth reading.  If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have.  <br />If you want a better book about the aftermath of a nuclear war, beginning with the somewhat droll premise that suburban life would try to go on, read Updike's Toward the End of Time.

Very suspenseful and also poignant, as the main character is the son of a Thai prostitute and a white American soldier.  He gives a moving picture of life in the ... trade, life as a half caste in Thailand, and life as a Thai Buddhist.  This last was fascinating and a big part of why I recommend this book.  It's a page turner of a murder mystery, starting with a dead marine and a beautiful suspect, but the best part is following what we have come to think of as a standard story through the viewpoint of a Buddhist cop working in a corrupt, if \\"compassionate\\" culture.  It's hilarious at times, and at times heartbreaking, and if you happen to guess who the murderer is, you'll still never guess why.  To people who say the ending is a letdown, well, that is one of the drawbacks of this type of book.  It's always a letdown to solve a tantalizing case and end a compelling read.  This book was definitely worth it, and I've already bought another of his books to read asap.	2004-01-23

You see, this book is well enough written, hence the three stars, but so unoriginal it's discouraging how much people have applauded it.  I do think the author has a great novel in him somewhere.

I thought the stories in this collection were all worth reading, although some were better than others.  Other reviewers have said Alexie is getting redundant, well, I don't know about that.  I enjoyed his book, Indian Killer, but I haven't read all his other short stories.  I loved his perspective on love, success, terrorism, and the women's movement, and found that it was not so different from my own, a woman of similar age who grew up in an Italian-Irish-American household where the only books in the house were mine, and the people were, in my opinion, way too accepting of their &quot;station in life,&quot; whatever the hell that is.  So I felt like I was reading a book written by a Native American cousin of mine--when some white folks were here killing his ancestors, others were back in Europe starving mine, regardless of being the same color.  Now, we all have to deal with the same issues, fear of terrorism, adultery, losing a child, failing our dreams, making it in the dominant culture, being ourselves.  Anyway, I recommend this book.  It's not perfect, but it shines.	2003-08-18

This book is excellent, and I'm not usually fond of kid characters. Harriet is exceptional.  You really feel her impatience and frustration with the foibles and limitations of the screwed up adults around her.  Her quest to explain her older brother's death when she was just a baby is probably the one thing that gives her life some structure.  Her mother has never recovered from the boy's death, and spends her days in bed.  Father is absent, and the collection of wacky great aunts and grandmother too much in their own little worlds to really reach her.  No one understands her pain when her mother fires her beloved nanny.  She has one good friend, who becomes her accomplice.  Although I bought this book because I liked The Secret History so much, I was doubtful that I'd enjoy it as much, but Tartt draws Harriet and her family so well, that I devoured the book, and loved Harriet almost from the beginning.  The ending is *slightly* disappointing, as was the ending of Secret History, but not enough to affect the experience of the book itself.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-12

Why, I wonder, did none of the reviews I read catch on to the reason the author alludes to The Great Gatsby?  In Gatsby, the narrator is so beguiled by his rich associates, that he somehow is led to overlook their essential evil.  In the same way, Tartt's narrator, Richard, is so taken with his new rich friends and desperate for their acceptance...  <br />I really enjoyed the glimpse into college life.  I remember characters chillingly like the ones Tartt created, and we might all bear in mind that often enough it's the threat of punishment that stops people from living their worst fantasies.  These characters expected to get away with everything for their whole lives.  I think the book could have been a little shorter, but the language and imagery are very well done, so the extra is forgivable. It's readable and compelling, but if you really despise pretentious, evil college students, you might be tempted to give it a low rating.	2003-05-26

It's not for everyone, but In the Cut is a gripping thriller.  I have to relate that although I read it in 2003, I remembered a violent excerpt I read in a review when it first came out.  It made that much of an impression on me, although I could not have told you where I read the excerpt until I found it near the end of the book.  I believed Franny, the main character, and thought she was believably out of it, as many people I know in NYC are, particularly in academia. She's so into her subject, language, that she feels insulated from reality.  I liked Malloy, the cop, and it might not be a bad idea to keep him going in future books.  The plotting was good, although the red herrings were a little misleading, particularly one that I won't give away, but some of that was because the book is so short.  Too much happens too soon to really savor.  It would have been better with more time for suspense to build, and to develop the obsessive relationship Franny has with Malloy, who sees her as a side thing.  The sex scenes are written well enough.  The much-mentioned anal sex scene in the office is only so realistic.  I mean, they hardly know each other, they live in NYC, and not a single thought of safe sex crosses her mind?  How self-destructive/stupid is she?  Or am I the one who's out of touch?  (I'm Franny's age, female and have worked in academia.)  Other aspects, such as her description of Malloy's body, were evocative.  I appreciated the neat twist that Franny's poor eyesight put on things.  I know from experience with a friend that the world is a different place than it is for us 20/20s.  Brava, and I am now reading The Whiteness of Bones.  I look forward to more from this author.	2003-04-09

She piles on the details, is unerring and insightful, but somehow, I just can't care about the characters.  They are among the world's most boring people, seen through a haze of tranquilized accuracy.  They are rich, but have dull thoughts, dull lives, dull problems.  The few who think of the world beyond themselves have dull thoughts about somehow doing things differently.  I kept thinking, so what? while reading about their lives.  So what?  Who cares?  This is just not interesting enough to be this long.  On the positive side, Oates' style is to keep piling on the accurate anesthetized details, so it really is okay to get bored and skip around.  This isn't a book that needs to be read from beginning to end.  You won't miss anything by dipping in here and there and hoping for a quick character profile in which Oates names designer names (shoes, suits, jewelry, handbags, autos).  It is a bit telling that her idea of an inspirational, somewhat disreputable artist-type is secretly a millionaire, but likes to live in a messy house.  The fiction, and maybe the author herself, is kind of insulated from reality, although she dips nervously down toward it from time to time.	2003-02-17

It's kind of amazing the way Gibson creates disturbing, alternative worlds and makes us believe in them, while at the same time linking them to the present world via surreal cyber connections.  It's really a reinterpretation of our reality.  There are people, after all, who live on bridges...  It's a fascinating book, imaginative and thought provoking and a must read if you like to wonder about the future.  Don't strain your brain trying to follow the plot line, just go along for the magical mystery tour.	2003-02-17

Reviews of this book are divided by whether the reader agrees with Thurman's politics.  That's not a book review.  If you agree that the wealth and happiness of every person depends upon the whole of human history and existence, and that we are all equally responsible for and connected to each other and the planet, then you will agree with the author.  If you believe it's everyone for himself (I choose my pronoun deliberately) based on rugged individual talent existing all by itself and making gains at the expense of who and whatever is in the way, then you probably won't.  In either case, this book is a thoughtful and humorous presentation of Buddhist philosophy as it may be applied to everyday western life, and the section on how to effect change is worth reading.  In fact, it's worth reading this book just to be inspired to visualize the kind of world we could create, if we didn't each think &quot;this whole party is for us.&quot;	2003-01-21

If he had written more about the world outside his little group of friends and lovers, Coyote could have had an interesting book.  As it is, it's mainly a chronicle of living dirt poor and having as much sex as possible, while being surprised that your gorgeous blonde deer-hide tanning girlfriend somehow always catches you cheating.  He makes the common mistake that the rest of us care how many women he slept with and under what circumstances.  Memoirists be warned:  What was most important to you is not what is most important to your readers.  He spends relatively little time on much more interesting events such as the prosecution of the San Francisco mime troupe, and the famous people who came to their aid.  In fact, he spends very little time on anyone else at all, except to point out that he knew or met them or somehow locate himself there.  Disappointing book.	2003-01-12
US	51964807	R59OZQ42U7MS6	0140239375	346778627	The Discovery of Heaven	Books	1	8	24	N	Y	An overrated, hackneyed book.	A very ambitious attempt at an overview of history and philosophy, but it does not contain anything new for a well-informed reader.  The characters are shallow and poorly written, and the story is contrived.  It seems to be a compendium of facts and trivia that were on the author's mind.  Very overrated, and a tedious book to read, as it is written from a distinctly old-fashioned, European perspective (dead white males).  The author makes much of the meaning of the child's existence, but it turns out to be very anticlimactic--his mission, which rightly doesn't even rate much mention in the book, as much as it is ballyhooed beforehand, is hardly worth the effort that went into producing him.  All very overblown and dull.  I consider this book to have been a waste of time and money.	2002-12-09

The most interesting part Atwood conveys is the residue in the adult artist Elaine Risely.  The scars we cover up that then have the power to affect us, years later.  It will resonate with anyone who has tried to go home again.  I read this book the same week I saw a childhood friend from years ago and didn't see the friend who had been the third of our trio.  It was the best imaginable timing.  It's a very complex study of emotional life, and in some ways very brilliant, although the scenes from childhood are excessive and long-winded.  Skim a bit, but read it.	2002-07-06

This is one of the best explanations of Zen koans you will find.  In clear and vivid language, Loori demystifies koans, making them understandable.  However, judging from the other reviews, not everyone got it.  To undertake koan study, Zen study, is not the same as undertaking, say, the study of literature.  To study Zen is to attempt to become Zen, become the koan, become the teacher.  You can't just learn about koans, you have to let your mind take the shape of each koan.  You will change.  In contrast, the study of literature is designed to make you a critic or a teacher, not necessarily a great writer.  You won't change; you'll just be the same person with some extra knowledge.  If your study of Zen has turned you into a critic of Zen masters, then you have wasted your time.	2000-05-10
