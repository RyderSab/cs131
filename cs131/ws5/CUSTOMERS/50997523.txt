In his final chapter, Spencer writes: \\"[i]t would be too pessimistic to say that there are no peaceful strains of Islam, but it would be imprudent to ignore the fact that deeply imbedded in the central documents of the religion is an all-encompassing vision of a theocratic state that is fundamentally different from and opposed to the post-Enlightenment Christian values of the West.\\"<br />And that about sums up the book.  At every turn, Spencer acknowledges that Islam has plenty of adherents who believe in Western-style liberalism: live and let live, separation of church and state, allegorical interpretation of harsher scriptural passages or an understanding that such passages are no longer in force, etc.  But he doesn't talk about them, because the point of this book is that Islam has a dark side.  Which is to say, many Muslims believe in and practice a pretty savage faith.<br />This, of course, is no surprise at all, if you read the news.  The Miss World-induced riots, \\"honor killings\\" in Jordan, death threats made against Salman Rushdie and other writers, female circumcision in North Africa, the Saudi girls burned to death in their school because the police wouldn't allow them outside without veils, the teenage girl sentenced by a Pakistani court to be gang-raped as punishment for a moral indiscretion of her brother, you name it; the Muslim world has quite a few barbarians.<br />What Spencer does that is interesting is examine the Islamic world in respect of various social or political issues -- human rights, liberal democracy, feminism, separation of church and state -- setting out the abuses of some Muslims and showing how those abuses, while they may look horrible to Westerners and to liberal Muslims, are fully compatible with Islam's fundamental documents, the Qur'an and the hadiths.  In other words, it's too simplistic to call these people \\"bad Muslims,\\" or to say that Islam condemns what they do.<br />Along the way, Spencer throws in some relevant and interesting history (the Crusades, the intellectual contributions of medieval Islam, etc.) and a staggering wealth of illustrative examples.  His writing is lucid and engaging throughout.  Highly recommended.resting history (the Crusades, the intellectual contributions of medieval Islam, etc.) and a staggering wealth of illustrative examples.

It never quotes from original sources.<br />Instead, this is an introduction to Napoleon for the general reader.  It's brisk, well-written and easy to read.  It draws a very human picture of a flawed man of tremendous consequence, and lays out what some of those consequences have been: the reshaping of European geography, the Code Napoleon and the rise of the totalitarian state.	2002-11-20

The introduction and commentary are both pre-multiculturalist and therefore unabashedly discuss such things as the moral lessons to be drawn from the Anabasis, and the Anabasis as a model of democracy.  Throughout, the text is furthermore illustrated with delightful little reproductions of Greek and Persian art, technology, monuments, coins, weapons, etc.<br />And of course, if you're looking to brush up on your Greek without the aid of a classroom and instructor, this edition is a great choice.  Not only does it have the advantages enumerated above, but the Anabasis itself is relatively easy and clear Greek with a historical rather than philosophical vocabulary.	2002-11-19

For starters, these are not the Hittites of the Bible (who are later, located in Syria and/or Canaan and are only to an unclear extent influenced by the earlier Hittites).  No, these are the Indo-European speaking Hittites of second millennium B.C. (1700 to 1200) Anatolia.  So if you're not a budding Hittitologist yourself, you can be forgiven for wondering why you should care.<br />Well, here's why: context.  The Hittites were a superpower, and without knowing something about them, you can't get a clear picture of any of their neighbors.  The history recounted in _The Kingdom of the Hittites_ interacts with and impacts upon the death of pharaoh Tutankhamen, the Trojan War and the migration of the Sea Peoples, for instance and just for starters.<br />Beyond that, their history is interesting reading in its own right.  The sources available reveal an astonishing wealth of detail, and Bryce is able to recount all kinds of bloody family squabbles and intrigue, quoting from contemporary records and correspondence.  Different Hittite monarchs emerge with clearly distinct personalities and character, and the book is an entertaining read.<br />I can't give it five stars, though, because I think a few small additions would immensely improve it.  The book needs more maps.  Some illustrations would also be useful.  Bryce himself suggests that \\"a comprehenive, up-to-date treatment of Hittite civilization and society might well provide a valuable complement to the present work.\\"  Fair enough: Bryce is writing a history, not an anthropological treatise.  Nevertheless, the history would be more accessible and sometimes more interesting if preceded by an introductory chapter on Hittite culture -- marriage patterns, for instance, and religion, are points that recur in the history but are never thoroughly explained.	2002-11-19
US	50997523	R27QLETV6Z4FAU	0226307654	849253156	002: The Complete Greek Tragedies, Volume 2: Sophocles	Books	5	13	14	N	Y	Fundamental	This is Volume II of a four volume set &quot;The Complete Greek Tragedies&quot; (Volume I is Aeschylus, Volumes III and IV are Euripides).  Like the other volumes, _Sophocles_ is a handsomely bound hardcover with stylized Greekish images interspersed throughout and one on the cover (in this case, a golden hoplite).<br />_Sophocles_ is light on interpretative materials -- no footnotes and only a brief essay introducing each play (a slightly longer essay introduces the Theban plays as a trilogy).  However, since the tragedians are much simpler to translate than, say, Aristophanes (who throws in lots of puns and current event references and untranslateable jokes and therefore really requires some explanation), the lack of critical apparatus is not a problem.<br />Sophocles, of course, is a must-read.  In his writings, drama has taken a step away from the choral Aeschylus and a step toward us by adding more actors and diminishing the role of the Chorus, so he is in some sense easier to read than Aeschylus.  Sophocles is also more &quot;tragic&quot; than Aeschylus, less upbeat -- Sophocles's heroes are in some sense transformed and earn the respect of the gods by their subborn loyalty to their own natures, but from a human perspective they always destroy themselves.  (A great introduction to Sophocles, while I'm at it, is Bernard Knox's book _The Heroic Temper_.)  And, of course, you simply have to read the &quot;Theban plays&quot; (&quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;, but especially &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;Oedipus Tyrannos&quot; or &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;).<br />Sophocles is a beautiful, insightful writer, and an important part of the Western canon.  This edition is a lovely and complete collection of his surviving plays.	2002-11-15

This book does not argue that the Greeks are an offshoot of some middle eastern civilization, or that Greek genius was merely a late and relocated flowering of Egyptian or some other oriental genius.  Burkert in no way detracts from the greatness and the uniqueness of the Greeks.<br />What he does is remove them from their isolation.  He does this by showing a number of points where the Greeks, in the early Archaic Age, borrowed from the cultures around them or at least shared common beliefs or practices.<br />The book is divided into three chapters, each organized around a class of people through whom East-West contacts occurred: craftsmen, seers / healers (workers in the sacred), and poets / singers.  Burkert in each chapter reviews archaeological, literary and philological evidence for cultural contacts or &quot;continuum&quot;.  And the evidence is not overwhelming, but it is considerable.<br />The achievement of _The Orientalizing Revolution_ is not to knock the Greeks off their pedestal.  It is to help us better understand the Greeks, by seeing some aspects of their culture in a broader light and by teaching us to apply insights from other lands and peoples to the Greeks.  This makes Burkert a worthy heir to Jane Ellen Harrison, for instance, and well worth reading.	2002-11-15

This has the virtue of accuracy and of keeping out fringe theorizing, but the vice of adding a modest Greek component.  Knox always puts the Greek in a parenthetical (i.e., you'll never fail to understand a sentence because of the Greek), but there is a lot of it.  If you don't know any Greek, this might encumber your reading somewhat.<br />Having said that, _The Heroic Temper_ is a fantastic little book.  Knox spends two chapters discussing the &quot;Sophoclean Hero&quot; in terms of all seven surviving tragedies, showing that the same character types, the same narrative tropes and even very consistently the same vocabulary is used in all seven.  He compares and contrasts Sophocles and Aeschylus (especially with respect to &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;) and analyzes the Sophoclean hero in terms of Sophocles' political context and religion.<br />This alone is eye-opening and ought to precede any reading of Sophocles, but Knox then goes on to discuss in greater detail &quot;Antigone&quot; (two chapters) and &quot;Philoctetes&quot; and &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; (one chapter apiece).  I wish I'd had this book in college -- it's worth more than all the lectures I heard on Greek tragedy.<br />The six chapters were in fact originally six lectures, and (Greek parentheticals aside) the book retains a verbal, even conversational tone.  Well written, insightful, powerful -- the book is a winner.	2002-11-12

If you haven't read Homer, you're not an educated person.<br />If I had to rate the additional material in this edition on its own merits, I'd have to give it something less than five stars.  Four, probably.  The glossary is useful, and the &quot;Backgrounds&quot; (a brief excerpt each from Kirk and Nilsson and then snippets from various archaic authors commenting on Homer) are worthwhile and sometimes amusing.  But the &quot;map of probable locations for legendary places mentioned in The Odyssey&quot;, for instance, is silly.  And the essays in the &quot;Criticism&quot; section seem randomly-themed and of hit and miss quality.<br />But the additional material is all just icing on a very good cake.

He carefully maintains the repetitions and line units of the original, so a reader of the English translation can get some sense of what the Greek feels like.  Well worth reading.	2002-11-08

It's volume one of a four volume collection, _The Complete Greek Tragedies_ (volume two is Sophocles and volumes three and four are Euripides), and all four volumes are lovely hardcovers, printed on nice paper, with handsome Greekish designs on the front and interspersed throughout.  Maybe not so attractive as to go on your mantel, but their prominence in your library will not be an embarassment.<br />The contents are lovely to match.  The translations (by Lattimore, Grene and Bernadete) are readable and flowing.  The book has almost no footnotes (only Grene's translations of \\"Seven Against Thebes\\" and \\"Prometheus Bound\\" have any at all, and there they are sparse), but each play (or collection of plays, in the case of the Oresteia) is introduced by a brief explanatory essay.  If you know nothing about the Greeks or Greek tragedy, these essays will not be enough to get you through (and you should check out Rose's _Handbook of Greek Literature_), but if you have a little background information already, the essays are helpful (especially the introductory essay to the Oresteia, which is the most fulsome).<br />Now, about the plays themselves.  Of course, you have to read them.  This is, effectively, the beginning of Western drama, and the combination of familiar and alien elements is fascinating.  In some ways, Aeschylus's plays are like modern musicals, or like opera, with very few characters, a big role played by a chorus, and lots of long songs.  Action happens all off-stage and is described by the characters.<br />In addition to being important as part of the history of drama, the plays are important primary sources of Greek mythology.  In particular, the Oresteia is simply the most complete telling of the murder of Agammemnon and his children's revenge.  In addition, \\"Prometheus Bound\\" is an important source for understanding the tale of the West's most famous fire-thief, and \\"Seven Against Thebes\\" gives detail and perspective about the tragedy of Oedipus not contained in Sophocles's retelling.<br />Finally, being the most ancient of the tragedians, Aeschylus gives narrative details that reflect a very ancient Greek culture, including, for instance, his ideas about justice and family and several descriptions of rites of aversion.

From this conclusion he guesses that Homer is likely describing a world that existed between the Mycenean era and the poet's own time.<br />Finley then goes literary, eschewing anthropology and archaeology and instead analyzing the texts of the Iliad and the Odyssey.  From the stories of Homer, he reconstructs the sort of society in the Homeric heroes lived, in terms of its economy, its social structure, and its morals and values.<br />The picture he draws is interesting and compelling, above all because it is consistent.  Its consistency is, of course, an argument in favor of the view that the Homeric world really did exist (i.e., that gods and magic and specific names aside, the cultural world described by Homer is authentic, and not an artistic creation).  Moreover, because the culture is consistent, an understanding of it helps a reader to interpret sometimes puzzling actions on the part of Homer's heroes.  This is therefore important secondary reading to accompany any reading of Homer.	2002-11-06

En route, he deals with perceived shamanistic influences, the notion of divine inspiration, the question of whether man has a soul, etc.<br />_The Greeks and the Irrational_ is great in itself and may have value, as Dodds indicates in his closing chapter, to moderns seeking to understand their own relationship with Irrationality.  It is also enlightening background reading for any student of the classics generally, in particular providing useful commentary on Homer, Plato (lots on Plato) and the tragedians.  Because each chapter was originally a lecture, Dodds' style is eloquent and also readable.  Each chapter is buttressed with an impressive clump of endnotes (about a quarter of the book must be notes) for further research.	2002-11-05

Major issues (the &quot;Homeric Question&quot;) are touched upon, and lost works are also described and named, to the extent possible.<br />A good index means that the book can also comfortably be used as a reference work, to be consulted for information on a particular writer.	2002-11-01

It starts with the adult Reagan already married to Jane Wyman and in Hollywood, beginning his \\"forty-year struggle\\" against communism, and it ends with the end of Reagan's Presidency.  In between Schweizer recounts the tale of how Ronald Reagan -- often alone and against public opinion and advice -- won the Cold War.<br />_Reagan's War_ is an important reminder of many truths about the Cold War: that Soviet communism was aggressively imperialist, determined to rule the world; that the Soviets crushed their own citizens and mangled their own economy; that the Soviets were aided and abetted by many agents and useful idiots in the West; that a generation of American politicians allowed the Soviets to expand and dominate by constantly giving ground and putting faith in the mirage of detente; and that Reagan beat the Soviets, precisely by being a warmongering cowboy who would not accept compromise or defeat.  Reagan challenged the Soviets on all fronts, supporting the Solidarity movement in Poland, broadcasting Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America into Soviet territory, arming and training insurgents fighting Soviet occupation, and most especially, by committing to an arms race that he knew the lumbering Soviet economy could not win.<br />_Reagan's War_ is well-written, often entertaining and sometimes quite moving.  In addition to being important history, the tale of Reagan's war against communism is a great moral example of the difference that an individual can make and a powerful illustration of the force of freedom.	2002-10-30

Huntington's thesis is that the post-Cold War world is no longer bipolar (Free World vs. Communist World, with the rest (the \\"Third World\\") scrambling around in between) but \\"multipolar\\" and \\"multicivilizational\\".  The centers of gravity in this new world order, he argues, are various \\"civilizations\\", defined along religious, cultural and linguistic lines: Western Civilization, Latin American, African, Islamic, Sinic (Chinese), Hindu, Orthodox, Buddhist, Japanese.  Huntington argues that this map of civilizations will help us to understand current and future conflicts, which increasingly are \\"fault-line\\" conflicts in which states or peoples belonging to different civilizations clash.<br />Secondarily, he argues that Western civilization is not universal and is in decline.  Islamic Civilization, in the middle of a huge demographic surge, is involved in most of the world's conflicts.  Muslims tend to interpret conflicts between other Muslims and Western states as clashes of civilization (the West vs. Islam).  These (secondary) points, of course, guaranteed the book a sudden increase in fame after September 11, 2001.<br />By and large this is an informative and interesting book.  Huntington's discussion of the \\"bloody borders\\" of Islam, for instance, is eye-opening and more than a little disturbing.  No doubt he is right that an understanding of civilizational differences will help policy makers to better understand current and future conflicts.  But I think he pushes his thesis a bit too hard, with a bit too much cultural determinism.<br />For starters, I think he sells the West short.  Western ideals are not held by everyone, it's true, but they are held by more and more people all the time.  They aspire to be universal and are compatible with any religion.  Civilizations change.  They also spread.  This is true, for instance, of Islam, an Arabian export which now has a presence pretty much everywhere.  It's also true of Western culture, which has gone from tiny Classical Greece throughout the world.  A future scenario which Huntington does not envision is the increasing adoption of Western-style liberal government, undermining the faultlines between civilizations.<br />Also, Huntington claims that, increasingly, non-Western countries modernize without Westernizing.  In so arguing, he never defines \\"modernization\\", but it's clear that he means modernization in a technological sense: better hospitals, bridges and guns.  What Huntington ignores is the link between Western culture and technological innovation.  Any country which does not adopt such Western norms as individualism, free rational inquiry, the separation of church and state and a dense civil society (i.e., a wide variety of organizations and powers, like religions, guilds, unions, corporations, etc.) can only \\"modernize\\" by importing technology.  It will therefore always be a step behind countries with Western-style cultures, and the West will continue to be more competitive and therefore very seductive.<br />Why can't Iranians or Iraqis, for instance, have a liberal state?  To say they can't and won't and are doomed by Islam to live in repressive states that chomp at the bit and hate the West seems to me a sort of bigotry.  Huntington is provocative and should be read.

Each essay explores how various patients of his wreck their own lives with stupid and self-destructive behavior.  A recurring theme of the essays, made more explicit in the \\"Grimmer Theory\\" essays and in the introduction, is that these people (the \\"underclass\\" of the book's title) destroy themselves by adopting and living on the principles of elite intellectuals.  Sexual freedom, the unsanctity of family, the specialness of victims, the victim status of criminals, moral relativism, nihilism, and similar ideas cut great bloody swathes in the lives of those that try to live by them.<br />This is Dick Weaver's _Ideas Have Consequences_, volume II.<br />Dalrymple is a good, clear writer who displays compassion for his patients but no willingness to whitewash their abysmally stupid decisions.  _Life at the Bottom_ is occasionally a depressing read, but is very illuminating and worth reading.	2002-10-23

They are not driven by poverty or desperation.  They are not pious muslims by ordinary standards and indeed their principal victims are moderate (\\"normal\\") muslims.<br />Of course, the Islamists' principal enemy is the West.<br />In this collection of essays, Pipes tackles an assortment of issues, including how to deal with sleeper cells, the U.S. government's relationships with Islamism, Islamist anti-semitism, Islamism's roots (or rather, lack thereof) in poverty, the battle for the soul of Islam between Islamists and traditional muslims, anti-muslim bias in the United States, the Nation of Islam, Islamist antipathy to free speech, and more.  Throughout, Pipes remains friendly to and respectful of Islam and muslims generally, while unflinchingly opposed to the radical Islamists.<br />Some of his conclusions are reassuring (only a small minority of muslims are or support Islamists).  Some are deeply disturbing (American muslim communities are disproportionately radicalized; money flows from the US groups to the Middle East rather than the reverse).

In documentaries, we tend to show these ancestors of ours as bearded, fur-wrapped stalkers of woolly mammoth, staggering around the tundra and pine forests of Europe trying to eke out an existence hand-to-mouth.<br />Of course, during the most recent ice age, the seas were lower by some hundred meters.  And all the land that was exposed 20,000 years ago and is now underwater was low, coastal plain, perfect for agricultural settlement.  If you were to look for an ice age civilization -- with ships, and farming, and real constructions -- the place to look would be underwater.<br />Think of it this way: if the oceans rose a hundred meters today, how much of our modern civilization would it swallow?<br />And of course, underwater archaeology is only in its infancy.<br />So this is a Graham Hancock book, a book about looking for tracks of ancient civilizations.  It's also a book about diving.  _Underworld_ is written in the comfortable travelogue / mystery style of _The Sign and the Seal_ and is very readable, very easy to follow.  Hancock traipses around to exotic places like Malta, Japan and India, diving to purported submerged sites of megalithic architecture.  Interspersed with this interesting narrative are his musings on literary and other traces that may reflect an ancient, ice age human civilization, now hidden by flood from human eyes.<br />Hancock, of course, may be wrong.  But he may just be onto something, and even if not, he's never dull.	2002-10-15

The readings include eight from Aesop, six from Theophrastus (witty little character sketches about the &quot;Grumbler&quot; or the &quot;Boor&quot;), eight from Lucian (short allegorical dialogues), 31 from Herodotus (Atticized), 32 from Thucydides, 32 from Xenophon (from various works) and 12 from Plato (various dialogues).<br />The readings are not ordered by difficulty, and are all pretty accessible after a year of Greek.  Neither the introductions to the various writers nor the textual notes are what I'd call fulsome (hence I give the book four stars, rather than five), but they are enough to help any autodidact through difficult constructions, slang forms, etc.	2002-10-14

Individual liberty, a landed middle class, political democracy, free markets and a tradition of rational free inquiry combine to make the West (the cultural heirs of the ancient Greeks) overpowering.<br />Each chapter of the book discusses a single battle and uses it to highlight a single Western trait.  Hanson first narrates the conflict, giving a battle map and sufficient background detail to make the story comprehensible, then analyzes the battle in terms of his thesis.<br />In addition to being a well written defense of a provocative thesis, _Carnage and Culture_ is a very pious book, respectful of the dead and their suffering.  Reading of the mangled dead choking the water at Salamis, for instance, isn't exactly pleasant, but it reminds you what war is about and reinforces Hanson's repeated admonition that he claims no moral superiority for Western warfare, only greater efficacy.	2002-10-14

If you have another instrument under your belt, this makes quick reading and then Tottle immediately starts you on learning simple pieces.  Since I already play the guitar, for instance, I opened this book and almost immediately learned my first rag.<br />After you have half a dozen dance numbers under your belt, Tottle breaks out a small chord dictionary and introduces the idea of the structured bluegrass song, with instrumental breaks in between verses.  Starting with &quot;The Banks of the Ohio&quot;, he then demonstrates how to construct a mandolin break around a song's melody.  As he adds numbers, Tottle increases in complexity, and it pretty quickly adds up to an impressive repertoire.<br />Tottle's writing is clear and straightforward.  All music is presented in standard notation and in tablature.  Occasional charming photographs of mandolin greats add a nice touch.<br />The book I have does not have the CD, but the CD can only add to what is a great instructional book.	2002-10-14

(as Hanson and Heath charmingly call their own book) is a savage indictment of university Classicists.  The answer to the question \\"who killed Homer and why?\\" is classicists, and for filthy lucre.  For money, career, fame and professional advancement, classicists have betrayed the Greeks by preferring academic heights to actual teaching, by turning Classical Greece into one more subject for multiculturalist, postmodernist, queer theorist, what-have-you studies, by ignoring the greatness and uniqueness of Greek culture and not caring what the Greeks actually have to say.  The professors don't live like Greeks, they fail to match word and deed.  So disinterested grad students (with their eyes firmly on the professorial heights) do all the actual teaching, and the students aren't coming anymore.<br />And Hanson and Heath confess that they don't believe that university Classics can be saved.<br />(Incidentally, the authors make it pretty clear that taking the Greeks seriously is antithetical -- and may be a good antidote -- to nonsensical multiculturalism.  There is truth, there is virtue, and all things are not equal.)<br />Interestingly, this core is sandwiched between introductory chapters which set out the unique importance of the Greeks and also the history of Classical Studies, emphasizing the sometimes revolutionary contributions of amateur classicists and a closing chapter giving an introductory syllabus and commentary to aspiring amateur classicists, ten books by Greeks and ten books about Greeks.  Hanson and Heath say they hope for another Homer, but they seem to be sending out a homing beacon to another Schliemann, Parry or Ventris.<br />Good for them.  Their devastating scorched earth criticism and their fluent, accessible writing make this book a fun read as well as a compelling one.	2002-10-02

Wood likes the word &quot;radical&quot; and says it a lot, but of course he isn't talking about Bolsheviks or anti-globalism protesters; he means old-style (Adam Smith) Liberals, or modern Libertarians.<br />And Wood paints an interesting and convincing picture of cultural change, from an early colonial society structured around hierarchy and personal relationships to freewheeling, atomistic culture arranging everything by contract.  What he never does, unfortunately, is convincingly demonstrate that the American Revolution (the war, or the restructuring of the government under the Articles of Confederation or the Constitution) was either a) fought for the purpose of bringing about this societal change or b) a significant catalyst in accelerating the change.<br />1. Wood clearly exaggerates the degree to which the colonies, just prior to the Revolution, were hierarchical and conservative cultures.<br />Some of the evidence he adduces for hierarchy is silly: does the prevalence of Christian churches really indicate a hierarchy, even if they do preach Romans 13 (p. 18)? How about the existence of a hierarchical military (p. 20), or vagrancy legislation (p. 20)?  What about the use of titles, like &quot;Esq.&quot; (p.21)?  We see all these phenomena today, of course -- so if they do indicate hierarchy and conservatism, they also indicate that we are still a hierarchical and conservative culture.<br />Frequently Wood presents evidence of great freedom and egalitarianism in the colonies, but then wills it away with an unsupported conclusion.  On page 14, for instance, we read that &quot;Englishmen on both sides of the Atlantic bragged of their independence.&quot;  Most American farmers &quot;owned their own land&quot; and English farmers were viewed as outrageously independent by continentals, but, cryptically, &quot;most colonists, like most Englishmen at home, were never as free as they made themselves out to be.&quot;  Huh?<br />We get quotes out of context.  So what if George Washington called ordinary farmers &quot;the grazing multitude&quot; (p. 27)? Without context, this is as meaningless as the John Adams quote that &quot;Common Persons... have no idea [of] Learning, Eloquence and Genius&quot; (p.27). For that matter, Washington's own career is later (p. 197) described as &quot;incomprehensible except in terms of...new, enlightened standards of gentility.&quot;  So was Washington an aristocrat or an up-and-comer in an era that did not respect blood?  He wasn't both.<br />Some of Wood's stories are contradictory and of little evidentiary value.  Old George Hewes trembles in the presence of &quot;Squire John Hancock&quot; because &quot;[p]eople in lowly stations ... were apt to be filled with consternation and awe when confronted with 'what were called gentle folks... beings of a superior order'&quot; (p. 29).  But Hancock was born poor, and became rich by inheriting the mercantile empire of his uncle. On page 37, Wood tells us that merchants (even &quot;[p]rominent merchants dealing in international trade&quot;, such as Hancock surely was) were not gentlemen:  their &quot;status&quot; was &quot;tainted&quot;.  So Old George Hewes was no doubt awed, not because Hancock was an aristocrat, but because he was a rich and famous man.  This, of course, is an indication that pre-Revolution America was ALREADY moving towards its Jacksonian destination, and NOT, as Wood would have it, evidence of the importance of status.<br />Wood even occasionallys slips and gives away the game, hinting at the egalitarian nature of colonial society.  &quot;Most colonial aristocrats were never able to dominate their localities to the extent that English aristocrats did&quot; (p. 115).  New Englanders were a &quot;stern, sober people, not much given to the hierarchies and displays of monarchy&quot; (p. 110).  &quot;The Americans did not have to invent republicanism in 1776; they only had to bring it to the surface.  It was there all along&quot; (p. 109).<br />And so on.<br />2. Wood himself indicates several times that the changes in American society were due to economics and demographics, and to processes which began before the Revolution.<br />In his chapter on patronage (surely one of the most interesting in the book), Wood makes it clearly that the early colonies essentially HAD to operate on a personal relationship basis.  With no paper currency and a small population, everyone kept &quot;book accounts&quot; of the debts they owed each other.  &quot;[S]uch credits and debts... worked to tie local people together and to define and stabilize communal relationships&quot; (p.  68).<br />But of course this was coming apart before the Revolution, simply as a result of population growth.  By the middle of the eighteenth century, the colonists had accepted paper money (p. 141); they needed it because they had &quot;expanded their inland trade (p. 140) -- i.e., they were no longer just dealing with their neighbors.  These developments, Wood even notes, &quot;suggest the various ways in which ordinary people ... were becoming more independent and more free of traditional patron-client relationships&quot; (p. 142).<br />And societal change due to economic growth continued after the Revolution. Wood notes factors causing change, including swarms of westward-moving immigrants (p. 310), increasing urbanization and industrialization (p. 312), banks (p. 316), etc., all having &quot;corrosive effects on what remained of the traditional patronage and hierarchical confidences between men in the society&quot; (p. 340).<br />So it's hard not to conclude that the radical changes chronicles by Wood were the result of simple population growth, and neither the goal nor, principally, the outcome of the Revolution.<br />3. Finally, Wood notes that the Founders were shocked by the society in which they died.<br />&quot;This democratic society was not the society the revolutionary leaders had wanted or expected.  No wonder, then, that those of them who lived on into the early decades of the nineteenth century expressed anxiety over what they had wrought... All the major revolutionary leaders died less than happy...&quot; (p. 365).<br />So even if you accept the thesis that Jacksonian America was the result of the Revolution, it was, on Wood's own evidence, not the objective.<br />But ignoring Wood's arguments and reading his evidence, it looks to me like the radical changes in American society were neither the goal of the Revolution nor its outcome.hierarchies and displays of monarchy&quot; (p. 110).  &quot;The Americans did not have to invent republicanism in 1776; they only had to bring it to the surface.

He dissects and examines the book's structure at multiple levels, and repeatedly discusses how different sections of Isaiah inform each other's meaning.  _The Literary Message of Isaiah_ includes not only his commentary, but his new translation of Isaiah, together with a thorough concordance to his new translation, to enable you to carry on you own research.<br />Gileadi is a believer, and quite openly consults Isaiah as an eschatological work, a guide to the last days.  Even if you don't believe Isaiah's prophecies, you should read this book as part of any study of Isaiah, because the complex, consistent and unified structure of the book of Isaiah, as explicated carefully by Gileadi, provide probably the best argument of single authorship.	2002-09-26

(Anchor Bible Reference Library)	Books	5	27	28	N	N	And Well Illustrated, To Boot	If you're looking for a book dealing with specific archaeological issues relating to the Bible, or that applies archaeological insights to biblical passages (like an archaeologist's version of _The New Manners and Customs of Bible Times_), this is not it.  In a few passages, Mazar does discuss the biblical narrative, but not that many.<br />Instead, this is a detailed overview of and introduction to the archaeology of the land of the Bible, starting well before biblical events begin in any recognizable geography (i.e., Abraham) and ending in the sixth century (i.e., the book covers most of the Old Testament period).  The book provides great context for the biblical narrative -- the application, you provide yourself.<br />In addition to being a very readable account of a potentially very dry subject, Mazar's book is profusely illustrated with maps, diagrams and black and white photographs.

Eliot and Robert Frost, among others).  The thinkers discussed include intellectuals, clergymen, politicians and poets, all thinking, working and writing in the Anglo-American sphere (most are in fact British or American, but the exceptions -- Tocqueville and Santayana -- wrote in America or for American audiences).  A good working knowledge of British and American history from the French Revolution through World War II is therefore a helpful prerequisite to understanding many of these thinkers.<br />The summaries are interesting and informative as description.  Many of them (the chapters on Burke and John Adams, for instance, or the section on John Henry Newman) make great introductions to figures whose work can't be read in comprehensive political treatises and many provide intriguing introductions to writers you have probably never heard of (Sir James Fitzjames Stephen) or to the thought of people whom you don't know as political thinkers (say, John Randolph or Arthur Balfour).<br />Among the wealth of description, a little prescription creeps in.  Kirk's heroes don't &quot;argue&quot; -- they &quot;know,&quot; they &quot;perceive,&quot; they &quot;realize,&quot; they &quot;understand.&quot;  Kirk is highly sympathetic with the ideas he summarizes, and it is no coincidence that his final chapter, on twentieth century poets, is called &quot;Conservatives' Promise&quot; and contains some of the most hopeful writing in the book. &quot;If men of affairs can rise to the summons of the poets,&quot; he writes, &quot;the norms of culture and politics may endure despite the follies of the time.&quot;  He ends upbeat, with a call to action of sorts.<br />Not to be missed is Kirk's first chapter, &quot;The Idea of Conservatism,&quot; in which he spells out the fundamental tenets which unite the belief of the writers whose work he describes, as well as their photographic negative, the tenets of radicalism.<br />The book dovetails perfectly with George Nash's _The Conservative Intellectual Movement in American after 1945_, which, of course, begins with Kirk himself and which carries on a similar discussion (though Nash omits from his narrative the British half and focuses on intellectual figures, to the exclusion of practical politicians like, say, Goldwater).ch he spells out the fundamental tenets which unite the belief of the writers whose work he describes, as well as their photographic negative, the tenets of radicalism. <br />The book dovetails perfectly with George Nash's _The Conservative Intellectual Movement in American after 1945_, which, of course, begins with Kirk himself and which carries on a similar discussion (though Nash omits from his narrative the British half and focuses on intellectual figures, to the exclusion of practical politicians like, say, Goldwater).	2002-09-19

Many writers from ancient times to the present day have seriously undervalued Cicero's consistency and effectiveness as a politician.\\"<br />The portrait that Everitt proceeds to paint, therefore, is principally one of a political figure.  To that end, he describes in great and accessible detail the turbulent politics of the deal (the death of the Roman Republic and the birth of the Roman Empire). As a sort of bonus, then, this biography of Cicero discusses in some detail the political careers of such contemporaries as Cato and the First Triumvirate (Pompey, Crassus and Caesar).<br />Everitt succeeds remarkably well at bringing to life the necessary context to make Cicero's political decisions and ideas comprehensible.  We see his conservatism and his attachment to the constitution of the Republic and also the career- and life-threatening perils that induced him, from time to time, to side with the anti-Republican forces (i.e., Caesar).<br />Cicero was no Cato, willing to die for the Republic.  He had other peccadilloes, too, which Everitt also recounts: a certain vanity, a habit of writing bad poetry, a lack of affection that may have ended his first marriage.  But he was an excellent writer of prose, a deep thinker on political issues, and enormously attached to his children.  And he was a great orator, and, from time to time, an immensely popular leader.  This well-written biography brings the interesting man to life.	2002-09-13

For each text, the authors/editors give you a discussion/analysis, touching on relevant context and highlighting ideas that appear in the text, the Hebrew transliteration of the text (in contemporary Hebrew characters), and a translation. In addition, the center of the book contains a series of black and white photos, some of the area (Wadi Qumran and its caves, Masada) and some of the scroll fragments.<br />I've casually cross-checked the 50 texts in this volume against my larger edition of the Scrolls (Geza Vermes's translation), and many -- perhaps all -- of the fifty are also contained in the larger edition.  What's different here, and what makes this book valuable, is the different translation (designed to emphasize, by vocabulary choice, points of commonality with the Jamesian Christian writings of the New Testament) and the commentary.<br />The fragmented texts reveal a community that was xenophobic, nationalistic, militant, pro-Maccabean and wildly apocalyptic. In addition, certain specific doctrines are clearly illuminated, including the resurrection of the dead and a single (as opposed to dual) Messiah.<br />The authors therefore paint a different picture of the Qumran community from proponents of the \\"Essene Theory\\" (like Geza Vermes).  This makes for interesting reading of the texts in this book and also informs alternative understandings of other Dead Sea Scrolls texts.  Very, very interesting.	2002-09-10

I feel their pain; the book teaches Greek like you might teach Spanish, with lots of activities relying on repetition and reading and constructing sentences by analogy.<br />So if you know no Greek at all and want to learn it, don't start here.<br />But if you want to re-learn your Greek from school, or refresh the Greek you learned from some other (more self-teaching friendly) book, _Ancient Greek Alive_ is great.<br />Because it teaches Greek like a living language, there's more emphasis on colloquial Greek than you typically find in a textbook on Attic.  You get a much better sense of the meaning of the little words, for instance.  Paradoxically, this better prepares you for reading, for instance, Plato, who wrote in dialog form and whose characters do not declaim sentences like you might find in, for instance, Mastronarde.<br />The chapters are digestible in size.  The writing is accessible and clear, and not encumbered by too much technical grammatical terminology early on.  The readings are entertaining and accessible, combining progressively longer quotations from ancient Greek sources with folktales from various sources and the adventures of Sheik Nasrudin translated into Greek.  Informative interludes introduce famous Greeks, aspects of Greek culture and the history of the Greek language.  Hard to beat.	2002-09-05

The case for reading the Dead Sea Scrolls is not as compelling as the case for reading the Bible.  Assuming their truth value is identical (i.e., both contain or do not contain the word of God), the Bible has the added attraction of being a fundamental text of Western culture.  The day may come when popular literature, song and film are sprinkled with allusions to the Community Rule, but we're not there yet.<br />But you ought to read the Dead Sea Scrolls anyway.  You ought to read them because they shed light on an important point -- the \\"Intertestamental Period\\" -- where the Bible is dark.  You ought to read them because they fill in some of the vacuum from which Christianity appears to spring.  You ought to read them because they're interesting.  You ought to read them for their moral content and because, just maybe, these books belong alongside the books of the Bible as inspired prophetic literature.<br />Vermes's translation is fluid and readable and this book contains all the significant Scrolls texts which are not either simply fragments or biblical texts.  A useful added bonus is a series of essays by Vermes about the history, practices and theology of the Dead Sea Scrolls community.	2002-09-04

A theme running through all of Eco's novels is the ambiguity between text and reality.<br />In _Foucault's Pendulum_, the \\"text\\" is a convoluted plan to do... something.  Take over the world, maybe.  This plan may have been hatched by the Templars, prior to their dissolution some seven hundred years ago.  Or maybe the plan was entirely hatched by three editors in a publishing house, speculating on historical possibilities and arcane canards.<br />Certainly, people around the editors act and react as if the plan had some substance, as if the goal of the plan were some object of incredible value.  Value great enough to kill for.  And so the book proceeds on two levels: the editors reconstruct history and the editors battle occult forces who may represent the partisans of the Templar plan, or who may believe that the editors are the Templars.<br />For me, the most interesting part is the historical reconstruction -- among other things, it's a great parody of books like _The Hiram Key_.  But the part narrative and the present narrative can't be separated that easily, and the whole is quite gripping.<br />So it's not an ordinary whodunit and you shouldn't expect it to end like an ordinary whodunit.  Eco is a great writer and an interesting thinker, and if you come without expectations of reading a pulpy thriller I think you'll really enjoy this book.	2002-09-04

Before 1900, polygamy was a pillar of the social organization of the Church.  Women were widely believed to acquire the priesthood authority of their husband through endowment and marriage.  The Word of Wisdom was counsel, not systematically enforced -- and more than one early prophet thought that the most important element of the Word of Wisdom was the injunction not to eat meat!  And so on. By 1930, in all these (and other) respects, the Church looked like the Church of today.<br />Whatever you think of the changes (personally, and polygamy aside, I find the Church of the nineteenth century pretty seductive), the history is interesting.  The book is well written, the authors' viewpoint objective (i.e., not hostile to or critical of the Church, and also not fawning salvation history).

Americans I know tend to think of Britain as a peaceful, crimefree place.  My British friends tend to think of America as a crime-ridden Hell.  Statistical data published in the last couple of years, amusingly, reveals that they're both one hundred eighty degrees wrong.  This book explores what happened on the British side of the pond.<br />Historically, of course, Britain has had low crime rates.  One aspect of the story that Malcolm traces is the evolution of gun ownership (stimulated by invention and ever cheaper gun prices and restricted, over the course of the 20th century, by ever harsher government regulation)and the relationship of gun ownership to crime.  The skinny is this: Britain had low crime rates as long as it had high levels of private gun ownership.  As the state has made private ownership illegal, crime has skyrocketed.<br />Another strand Malcolm illuminates is the changing nature of British law enforcement.  Britain only acquired policemen in the modern sense in the middle of the nineteenth century, under the leadership of Sir Robert Peel (hence the nickname \\"Bobbies\\").  Prior to that time, the general public was expected to -- and did -- assist in the apprehension of lawbreakers.  The general public was, of course, armed to the teeth.  And (see above) Britain had low crime rates.<br />But since the introduction of professional police, the British government has increasingly tried to grant itself a complete monopoly on the use of force.  Not only has it progressively made private gun ownership illegal (no one here can own pistols anymore, and it's pretty difficult to get a permit to own a rifle, even for sport), it has also eroded, almost into nonexistence, the traditional British right to self-defense.<br />Witness the 1999 case of Tony Martin, a farmer in an isolated area whose home had previously been burgled.  Two professional burglars broke into his home, and he shot them, killing one.  Guess who got life imprisonment?  That's right, the farmer.<br />Malcolm's writing is lucid and pleasant and her exposition thorough.  ...armer.<br />Malcolm's writing is lucid and pleasant and her exposition thorough.  ...	2002-08-09

This book is densely written and merits -- maybe requires -- multiple readings. Fortunately, it's also a compelling book, which will make you want to reread it.<br />The idea whose consequences Weaver entails and deplores he identifies as nominalism or relativism -- the absence of belief in any source of truth outside man, the absence of universals, the reduction of all things to formless particulars.<br />You might have thought that such an idea was too abstract to have any impact on your life, but Weaver argues persuasively that nominalism makes impossible the \\"metaphysical dream\\" of an organized universe, leading to social chaos, formless art, virtueless individuals suckered by newspapers, movies and radio (today I imagine he would have added television to the list) into believing that life consists only of chasing ever more creature comforts and a universal \\"spoiled-child psychology\\".<br />He also prescribes remedies.  The ownership of property, he argues, is the sole surviving \\"metaphysical right\\" our culture recognizes, and the starting point for anyone wishing to restore other metaphysical ideas.  Because language is so closely tied to thought, Weaver argues for some language-oriented educational remedies (more emphasis on poetry in education, and on foreign languages, especially Latin and Greek).  He also argues the case for the dying virtue of piety, which he defines as respect for nature, respect for the substance of others, and respect for the substance of the past.<br />There's more than a little of the grouchy conservative in Weaver.  For instance, he complains bitterly about jazz, \\"the clearest of all signs of our age's deep-seated predilection for barbarism.\\" This reminds me, amusingly, of Robert Bork's similar complaints in _Slouching Towards Gomorrah_ -- except that Bork complains that rock and roll is the degenerate music of adolescence, in contrast to the serious and adult-themed music of... you guessed it... jazz.<br />But this is a small flaw.  Weaver's diagnosis of the ills of our age is insightful and thought-provoking.  I, for one, am certainly willing to take a crack at his proposed remedies.Weaver's diagnosis of the ills of our age is insightful and thought-provoking.

Akkadians that published the blood libel and translations of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion would be -- you guessed it -- anti-semites).<br />The discussion of Arab anti-semitism is preceded by a thorough laying of foundations, consisting of chapters discussing the history of the term \\"semitic\\", the history of semitic-speaking peoples, the history of the Jews, and the rise of Zionism.  Anti-semitism proper is then chronicled, beginning with the 1648 uprising of the Ukrainian Cossacks and following through to contemporary Arab expressions.<br />Anti-semitism is not, of course, just disliking or being rude to Jews.  It's a form of hatred that characterizes Jews as being uniquely and cosmically evil, and that relies on the repetition of certain core tropes: the Jews drink blood, the Jews conspire to take over the world, blah blah.<br />What Lewis argues is that, while this sort of treatment of the Jews is commonplace in contemporary Arab media, Arab anti-Semitism is a recent innovation, coming into existence over the last half-century.  Medieval Arabs stereotyped Jews as well, but merely as cowardly, and some medieval Arab accounts of Mohammed's victories over his Jewish contemporaries paint the Jews as \\"tragic\\" figures and accord them \\"dignity\\" in their defeat.  Medieval Arab treatment of Jews was, Lewis argues, in the middle of the Bell curve -- both the best and the worst treatment of Jews was to be found in the Christian West.<br />Until now.  The rise of the state of Israel has seen a simultaneous explosion of anti-Semitic writing, ranting and posturing in the Arab states.  This book, written well before September 11, 2001, is now more relevant than ever as a guide to understanding the crazed rhetoric flowing around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as the more general muddled meeting of the Arab world and the West.e general muddled meeting of the Arab world and the West.	2002-07-22

Adults look at Eminem, or Britney Spears, or Doom, and see horrific anti-social media that might corrupt their children.<br />In this interesting and well-written book, Gerard Jones points out that children see something entirely different.  Especially where children are not merely passive consumers, fantasy media, including violent shows and video games, are a tool that children use to very important ends -- learning to distinguish fantasy from reality, learning to organize reality, learning to overcome powerlessness and how to act when they are no longer powerless.<br />Jones does not champion laissez-faire parenting and the surrendering of your child to Hulk Hogan and the Spice Girls.  Throughout, he suggests an active, empathetic approach to your child's media consumption.<br />The book is thought-provoking and a much-needed counterbalance to a great deal of hysteria.	2002-07-19

Ann Coulter, the wild she-stallion of the American right, is kicking down doors all over town.  And man, does she make me laugh. But like De Niro's Al Capone in the Untouchables says, \\"we laugh because it's funny and we laugh because it's true.\\"<br />The book's title is a bit misleading, in that it makes the book sound like a critique of media bias.  Rather, it's about how the left argues.  Or rather, how the left doesn't argue.  Instead of arguing, the left labels its friends moderates and its enemies both extremists and stupid and attempts to stifle free speech in media it does not control.<br />Coulter lays out her case with devastating wit and with numerous illuminating examples from recent history, such as the Clinton impeachment, the 2000 election debacle, the nomination of John Ashcroft for Attorney General and the rise of such alternative media icons as Rush Limbaugh and Matt Drudge.<br />If you don't like Ann Coulter, this book won't make you like her any more.  But if you're fed up with the anti-thought, pompous antics of leftist rhetoric, read _Slander_.  Speaking truth to power was never so funny.	2002-07-16

To some extent, it forced me to decide what kind of conservative I am.<br />The book is not strictly chronological in its discussion.  Nash begins with one chapter apiece on each of the three principal strands of American conservatism post World War II: libertarianism, traditionalism, and anti-communism.  Each strand is discussed chronologically and in terms of its principal proponents, leading works, publications, organizations, roots and, of course, theory.<br />Subsequent chapters discuss the efforts of these three groups to cooperate and to consolidate, the efforts to find specifically American roots for conservative ideas, and the growth of the conservative movement in the thirty years or so following 1945.  An Epilogue written for the 1996 edition discusses subsequent changes in American conservatism, including neoconservatism and the religious right.<br />The title correctly identifies the subject matter of the book -- it is a history of an intellectual movement, and only secondarily a political history.  Certain watershed events in contemporary conservatism (the McCarthy investigations, the election campaign of Barry Goldwater, and similar) are touched upon, but principally as phenomena to which conservatives react or by which they are shaped.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-07-15

A vain man and one accustomed to luxury, he nevertheless gives very generously of both his money and his time to the revolutionary cause and to the governing of Massachusetts.<br />His career includes stints as the president of the continental congress, member of the Massachusetts legislature and governor of the newly independent state of MA.  His roles in the revolution and the adoption of the constitution are central: as president of congress, his is initially the only signature on the Declaration of Independence; he coordinates and equips the continental army, including large expenditures out of his own pocket; he turns the tide in Massachusetts in favor of ratification.<br />So the biography is interesting because the man is interesting, even pivotal.  It's also well-written, in the sense of being easy to read.<br />But the book's also a little spiteful.  Anyone who clashes with Hancock, ever, comes in for a little sting from the biographer's pen.  Sam Adams, in particular, is described as a bloodthirsty, erratic and backstabbing radical, who undercuts and betrays Hancock at every turn.  Even George Washington is painted as behaving irrationally, in contrast with Hancock's genteel polish, in respect of some offers of hospitality that Hancock extends to the general, and Unger seems incapable of mentioning John Adams without calling him \\"fat little John Adams\\".	2002-07-11

The content should be judged for its truth value alone -- to look to the author for motivation is to engage in fallacious ad hominem argument.<br />But it does make a difference.  It makes a difference because it shows how bad the situation is.  Even Tammy Bruce, a committed and prominent activist feminist, has come under the withering cannons of the left, silenced, in fact, for speaking out on behalf of women.<br />This book is about thought control and how the modern left tries to silence dissent both within its own ranks and in the society at large.  Bruce makes her case by discussing her own experience with what she calls the &quot;Thought Police&quot; in respect of various issues (Dr. Laura, AIDS, O.J. Simpson, etc.), and finishes by making a call for more healthy dissent and for free discussion.<br />The book is readable and quick, with a very &quot;from the trenches&quot; feel to it.  In addition to making her a dramatic example of how totalitarian the left has become, Bruce's history as an activist has given her a lot of really interesting stories to tell.

The Nazis, for instance, were self-proclaimed socialists, but are described as \\"right-wing\\", together with Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek.  Go figure.  (Of course, as Sowell points out, this twisted nomenclature is a weapon of the anointed, who tar anyone opposed to them by lumping them together with Nazis and the KKK.)<br />So it's the anointed and the tragedians.  The anointed believe in their own unlimited ability to change society, in \\"problems\\" that have \\"solutions\\", in categorical decision-making, and in their own absolution from any unforeseen consequences of their decisions on the basis of their good intentions.  To the anointed, those who disagree are evil.<br />The tragedian believes that all human actors have limited power to change society and that specialization is therefore good, that causation is systemic, all outcomes being the result of hundreds or thousands or millions of discrete individual decisions, and that all change comes as the result of trade-offs and that cost and negative consequences must be considered in decisionmaking.  To the tragedian, those who disagree are dumb or don't get it.<br />And the anointed have seized the cultural heights.  Their place in universities, the media and the judiciary give them power all out of proportion to their numbers.<br />Sowell analyzes not only how the anointed think, but also how they act.  He examines the rhetoric that the anointed use to cut short debate, their insistent unaccountability to fact, present or future, their use of \\"mascot\\" groups to advance their causes, their vocabulary, their use of an activist judiciary to undermine the rule of law, and ultimately the question of whether the anointed believe in anything that resembles an objective reality.<br />This is a great analytical primer on the thought of the anti-left.  It's one of those books that articulates things you know to be true, but that never would have occurred to you to formulate as a conscious statement.  \\"Of course!\\" You'll want to shout.  \\"Hallelujah!

He is not saying that the media is dominated by a vast left-wing conspiracy.  Rather, he is saying that members of the mainstream media believe that their own views are the political mainstream, unaware that most Americans swim somewhere off to their right.<br />Because the mainstream media don't understand that they live in La-La-Leftieland, they present cultural and political issues as if their beliefs were middle of the road.  Phyllis Schlafly is a \\"conservative,\\" but NOW is just a \\"women's organization.\\"  This is not an attempt to trick anyone, Goldberg argues -- the media just don't realize how far out in left field they are.<br />Goldberg makes his case in respect of a number of issues, illustrated with amusing and infuriating anecdotes drawn from his 28 years at CBS.  Throughout, the discussion is woven into his account of his own awakening to this issue, his writing of op-eds on the subject, his falling from the good graces of Dan Rather et al., and his eventual drumming out of CBS.<br />I'm sure that the bias exists.  I'm not so sure that it's as innocent as Goldberg suggests -- it's hard to believe that clever, articulate, educated people can be so willfully blind.  In any case, the book is illuminating as a cultural critique and entertaining as a narrative, well written and very readable.	2002-06-28

For challenging leftist racial orthodoxy, Horowitz was systematically branded a racist.  Many university papers refused to run the ad.  Others ran it, but editorialized against Horowitz in the same edition, to protect themselves.  Papers that ran the ad without comment often suffered threats, protests, and insults.  Universities held panel discussions denouncing Horowitz's ideas, without inviting Horowitz or anyone else to defend him.  When Horowitz was invited to speak in university fora, he got shouted down and tarred a racist for his troubles.<br />All this for what?  Because, like 75% of Americans, he opposes the idea of reparations for slavery.<br />So in a sense, this book is about reparations.  Really, it is about the reparations debate, and how Horowitz's experience in that debate reveals that American universities, rather than being centers for the free discussion of ideas, are gladiatorial pits in which one side, aided and abetted by faculty and administration, tries to howl the other out of existence.	2002-06-27

For instance:<br />1. Blacks benefit more from gun ownership than whites.  On average, black Americans live in worse neighborhoods with higher crime rates than white Americans.  When laws permitting citizens to carry concealed firearms are introduced, crime rates fall more dramatically in those neighborhoods, and black Americans benefit disproportionately.<br />Yep, that's right.  Gun control is racist.<br />2. Women benefit more from gun ownership than men.  Women's ownership of concealed weapon permits decreases the women's murder rate more than men's ownership decreases the men's rate.  Women toting guns also significantly reduce the rape rate.<br />Amen, sister.  Gun control is sexist, too.<br />3. Private gun ownership is cheap law enforcement.  I don't mean vigilantism -- I mean deterrence.  Private gun ownership lowers more crime per dollar spent than almost any other crime reduction measure...and the gun owners bear virtually all of the cost.<br />And the list goes on.  In addition to the statistical analysis (including abundant responses to academic and not-so-academic criticism), Lott recounts the reception of his initial paper on the subject, as well as the hardback edition of the book, and discusses the media mistreatment of school shootings and similar events.<br />The book is dense, but as statistics-driven sociology goes, quite readable.

It Also Ought to Be Easier to Read	The beginning of human civilization as you learned it in school goes like this:<br />Human beings (homo sapiens) have been around for some 100,000 years, give or take. Until about six or seven thousand years ago, after the end of the most recent ice age, humans were a bunch of wandering hunter-gatherers.  They made some great cave paintings, but other than that and a few gnawed bones, they made nothing and left nothing behind.  Then, when the ice age ended, they spontaneously dropped their fur cloaks, stopped hunting woolly mammoths and invented agriculture, the wheel, cuneiform, beer, and everything else that makes up civilization.<br />The problem with this picture, of course, is that the ice age didn't cover the entire earth with ice -- just some of the parts we live on now.  And because there was so much more ice, there was less water, and sea levels were some 100-odd meters lower than at present.<br />So all the best land, the fertile, coastal land, during the ice age -- the era immediately preceeding the first great civilizations of the near easy -- is now underwater.<br />In _Eden in the East_, Oppenheimer focuses on the great Sunda Shelf in southeast Asia, which in the last ice age was a continent-sized land mass (now sometimes called \\"Sundaland\\").  His thesis is that the great civilizations of the near east did not spring whole cloth from the soil, but were founded, or informed, or guided, by refugees from the east, refugees fleeing the great destruction of their homeland with the submergence of the Sunda Shelf.<br />He argues for his thesis on the basis of genetic, linguistic and mythological studies, all appearing to show a diffusion of culture and people from some prehistoric Sundaland home.  The arguments are varied and interesting, maybe even compelling.  Certainly they are worth reading.<br />But they are also very difficult to read.  This is a dense book, almost five hundred pages in the edition I have and written in a fairly dry, scholarly tone.  So read it, but be warned.<br />If you're interested in the argument that human prehistory is to be sought in the lands that sank beneath the waves at the end of the last ice age, check out Graham Hancock's book _Underworld_ (already published here in the UK and coming to America soon).  Hancock does not focus exclusively on Sundaland, but his arguments and evidences are complementary to those adduced by Oppenheimer.

It assumes only very basic guitar and Bluegrass knowledge.<br />2. Standard musical notation and tablature.<br />3. Teaches you not only the basics (the guitar run, the boom-chicka effect) but also a variety of guitar solos that gradually build up your skills.<br />4. Great instructional CD.<br />5. Gives you a good basic repertoire of classic Bluegrass / folk / gospel songs.<br />If you want to learn the basics before you go to a Bluegrass festival, take this book to the woodshed.  Even if you aren't interested in Bluegrass per se, this book is a good introduction to flatpicking generally.	2002-06-13

Title IX sounds like a good idea -- who on earth would be in favor of discrimination against women in education?<br />Of course, as with every road to Hell, it's the UNINTENDED consequences that get you.  In the case of Title IX, Ms. Gavora lucidly and compellingly documents what the unintended consequences have been:  Title IX has been used to assault collegiate men's athletic programs.<br />But wait, you say.  Surely you must be in favor of increased opportunities for women, even if that means fewer opportunities for men!  Isn't that fair?<br />Well, it sure sounds fair -- but that isn't what Title IX is being used to do.  The gender totalitarians enforcing Title IX have introduced into it the notion that it requires gender parity, or even that funding of and participation in athletic programs need to be distributed on the same gender proportions as general university enrollment.<br />So universities that have been unable to attract a sufficient number of women athletes -- universities where spots on women's teams sit unfilled because of lack of applicants -- have cut thriving and even self-funded men's programs to get their women-men ratio to the right level.<br />In other words, Title IX is being used to reduce the opportunities for men to play college sports even where no new opportunities for women are created or where women patently do not want those opportunities.<br />What woman actually want does not matter to these gender militants.  What matters is that men's athletics programs must be smashed to bits, and the Federal government, levered into play with Title IX, is the biggest stick around.<br />Ms. Gavora is an excellent and convincing writer and this is an important and honest book.	2002-05-31

It was also fought on American soil, and America's enemies included some of her own citizens -- not just communist sympathizers, or fellow-travellers, or even members of the Communist Party, but spies and saboteurs, members of the communist underground who lived in deep cover and took their orders from Moscow.<br />The tendency now is joke about \\"commies,\\" and how the \\"Russians are coming!\\"  _Witness_ is important because we must remember that the threat was real, and people like Whittaker Chambers (who left the communist underground and testified against it) and Ronald Reagan (who fought the very real communist presence in Hollywood before entering the Oval Office to fight it on a grander scale) are heroes.<br />The book is also INTERESTING, among other reasons, because it details -- from Chambers's perspective -- the famous Hiss Trial.  Chambers names the names (well, most of the names) of his underground associates, and the 20th century -- the New Deal, Yalta, McCarthyism -- just doesn't look the same after you've read this book.<br />Best of all, _Witness_ is BEAUTIFUL.  It's a very well written memoir by a powerful writer whose own spiritual journey -- from the godless quasi-religion of communism to faith in a divine Creator -- had repercussions throughout America, and, arguably, the world.	2002-05-30

He's a great writer.  It's a pleasure to read him, just for entertainment value.  There's a little piece of doggerel from Orwell's school days that he quotes several times that is now stuck in my head:<br />  The rain it raineth every day<br />  Upon the just and the unjust fella<br />  But more upon the just because<br />  The unjust has the just's umbrella<br />I don't know why that sticks with me, but it's a great illustration of Orwell's use of solid, colloquial and even humorous English.<br />Moreover, in addition to providing wonderful model prose he occasionally writes essays about writing and language (the use of \\"Basic English\\", oratorical versus conversational English, what drives a writer, the totalitarian perversion of word meanings, etc.), which are insightful and interesting.<br />2.  If you're interested in the Second World War (or for that matter, the Spanish Civil War), Orwell's writings amount to a sort of diary, a primary document.  Even his book reviews almost inevitably contain some reference to the political and historical scene.<br />3. Orwell loved socialism (yes, the man who write _1984_ was a democratic socialist), but he loved freedom more.  His simultaneous battle for socialism and against totalitarianism (i.e., the Soviet Union) is engaging, even -- or maybe particularly -- where he drops the ball.<br />...<br />I think Orwell's heart was in the right place -- he had seen close up (and written a good deal about) the suffering of the poor.  Like many people who have their hearts in the right place, he jumped immediately to the idea that redistribution of private property and collective ownership of the means of production were the only way forward.<br />On the other hand, he was a writer and a man of ideas, a person who greatly prized personal freedom.  His essays give an intriguing glimpse into the battle raging inside him between collectivism and individual liberty.l freedom.

The book has no bibliography and no notes at all.<br />This means that when the author says, for instance, that the &quot;synagogue itself seems to have come into existence during the Exile&quot;, he gives you absolutely no way to evaluate what &quot;seems to&quot; means.  Probably?  Almost certainly?  The preponderance of scholarly opinion?  Does &quot;seems to&quot; mean that the institution might pre-date the Exile, or be more recent?  No way to tell, and you're completely on your own for follow-up research.<br />2. The author often gives one explanation for a phenomenon without explaining that there are others.<br />For example, the author states, without qualification, that &quot;Maccabeus means 'the hammer'&quot;.  He neglects to explain that &quot;hammer&quot; is only one explanation for Judah the Maccabee's famously cryptic epithet.  It might mean the &quot;commander&quot;, or be a family name, or a statement of the uniqueness of God, or (my favorite) maybe it's better translated as &quot;hammerhead&quot; -- Israel describes most of its heroes as physically beautiful, but, strikingly, not Judah.  Maybe he was an ugly cuss.  Again, as there are no notes, you have no way to do further research on your own.<br />3.  I don't know about the author's frequent use of the very broad term &quot;Bible times.&quot;  The impression the book gives is that most of the cultural institutions it describes were identical for thousands of years (and may still exist among, for instance, the Bedouin), with the exception of the rule of the Romans.  Maybe this is true, but the phrase &quot;Bible times&quot; makes me a bit nervous.<br />Nevertheless, I recommend this book.  Its many wonderful advantages include the following:<br />1. Profuse illustration. Photos, maps, schematic diagrams, charts and lovely artists' reconstructions really help you get an idea of the institutions and customs described.<br />2. Highly readable prose, accessible to any adult reader and even older children.<br />3. The book is divided into thematic chapters each of which ends with a subsection entitled &quot;Now look at your bible,&quot; in which the author shows how information from the chapter clarifies specific biblical passages.<br />4.

It does not treat any particular issue in enough depth to be so.<br />It is, rather, a sort of textbook.  Call it &quot;Introduction to Academic Thought About the Bible.&quot;  Following the order of the biblical texts and with detours to discuss such topics as the pseudepigrapha and the inter-testamental period, the book lays out basic issues of historical, archaeological and textual biblical criticism, such as, for instance, the idea of the J, E, D and P-authored components of the Old Testament, or the question to what extent the books of Joshua and Judges present different narratives of the conquest of Palestine by the Israelites, and what archaeology has to say about that conquest.<br />The book does not discuss theology (at least, not modern theology).  If you're an inerrantist, this book is not what you're looking for.  If you're reading the Bible for the first time, this is probably too much information and not the kind you need to help you follow the narrative.  Though it has a section of color plates (and black and white photos throughout) and a limited number of maps, this is not an atlas.  This is also not a debunk-the-Bible book -- mainstream believers in the inspired nature of the Biblical should by and large have no objection to the contents of this book.<br />But if you're generally familiar with the Bible, and interested in increasing your knowledge (in particular, I would suggest reading this alongside a reading of the Bible itself, a method to which the organization of this book lends itself) about Bible studies, I recommend this book without reservation.	2001-12-14

Lee took it upon himself to do the same.<br />Brooks deals with the Massacre more thoroughly in her appropriately-titled _Mountain Meadows Massacre_, also available on this fine website.  But the picture is incomplete without an understanding of who John D. Lee was.  That picture is provided in great detail by this book, and it is sometimes startling.<br />Lee was not some renegade Danite chieftain.  Raised on the American frontier, he joined the Mormons and became a pillar of the southern Utah community -- a church leader, the federal government's Indian farmer, and an officer in the militia.  He was widely respected and reputed to have spiritual gifts of prophecy and healing.<br />And on the day of the Massacre, he was in a bad spot.  Caught between conflicting and ambiguous military orders and facing the alternatives of killing not-completely-innocent travellers and alienating the native american population at a moment when the U.S. Federal government had declared war on the Utah Mormons, he made a tough choice.<br />Eventually, of course, Lee was banished for his crime, living out his last years as a ferryman with a greatly reduced family on the Utah-Arizona border.  Some odd details strike you when reading Brooks' account, though:<br />1. There's plenty of evidence that people talked about Lee's excommunication, but in the well-kept church records, no sure indication that it actually happened.<br />2. Lee was a spiritually powerful man and a firm believer.  Moreover, he was an intimate of Brigham Young (Young's adopted son, in fact).<br />3. Lee was a frontiersman through and through, one of the few Mormon pioneers (along with, say, Orrin Porter Rockwell and Bill Hickman)really equipped to deal with the harsh desert environment.<br />4. Lee was banished not when Brigham Young found out about the Massacre, but years later, and almost certainly in response to public sentiment.<br />So ask yourself this:  if you were Brigham Young, and you needed to sacrifice someone to protect the church, who would it be?  It's hard not to wonder whether John D. Lee's banishment was a calling.  Maybe he wasn't excommunicated at all, but sent away as a visible sacrifice for the good of the community.  Only a man with Lee's faith, independence and wilderness skills could be called on to make such a sacrifice.<br />Likewise, Lee seems to have virtually surrendered to his own execution, but it's not clear why.  Was he again sacrificing himself for Brigham Young and the church?  Did he feel the guilt of the Massacres and seek to atone by offering his own life?<br />I don't know, but I know this: if you're interested in Mormon history, Utah history or even the history of the American West, you should read this book.e Massacre, but years later, and almost certainly in response to public sentiment.<br />So ask yourself this:  if you were Brigham Young, and you needed to sacrifice someone to protect the church, who would it be?

It assumes virtually no knowledge of the instrument to begin with.<br />2. The exercises are gradated, slowly adding additional chords and keys and more complex picking patterns.<br />3. The exercises are designed to teach you to move your thumb independently from your fingers.  This gives you that great \\"wow, it sounds like two guitars!\\" effect.<br />4. The accompanying CD, while not always perfectly indexed to the book (I think it must have been a cassette first), allows you to hear a very skilled player playing the exercises and pieces.<br />5. The culmination of the exercises is a collection of five real pieces, including songs by Robert Johnson and Willie Brown.  These pieces are stylistically different from each other and require you to stretch a bit beyond what you've learned in the exercises, with the result that together they make a nice little blues repertoire.<br />Decide today to (get better) on the guitar -- buy this book.	2001-12-13

Before reading this book, I knew Daniel Defore only through his exciting fiction: Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders, etc.<br />It turns out that Defoe also has an exciting life: struggling merchant in and out of bankruptcy, political pamphleteer, pilloried for slander, government spy, and so on.<br />Sadly, though you can pick the interesting elements of Defoe's life out of this work, it takes some effort.  Novak's book is really a lengthy analysis of Defoe through his writings and spends much more time discussing the polemical meaning of various poems than, say, Defoe's relationship with his wife, or his travel, or his education.<br />In fact, all aspects of Defoe's life are really only described in this biography insofar as they can be accessed through Defoe's writings.  This makes the book -- whose scholarship I do not fault -- tedious and not very easy to read as biography.	2001-12-12

You've heard the standard slanders trotted out time and again: Christians have committed genocide, mass slavery, religious warfare, spiritual totalitarianism, you name.  Such claims rely on distorted history and, often, the absence of a reasoned response, and the charges increasingly become part of the educational myths that public school beats into our children.  This book answers the charges.<br />The authors' defense of Christianity is reasoned and detailed, much too much so to be examined in this limited space.  To generalize, most the of the responses fall into one of these categories:<br />1. THE ACCUSERS SIMPLY HAVE THE FACTS WRONG.  For instance, the Pope was not complicit with the Nazis, but on the contrary sheltered and protected Jews and criticized and attacked the Nazi regime at every practicable opportunity.<br />2. THE ACCUSERS OVERLOOK THE GOOD THAT CHRISTIANS (AND CHRISTIANITY) HAVE DONE.  For instance, Christians ended the slave trade.  Christian ideas laid the foundations of modern democracy.  Christian cosmology created the cultural prerequisites for modern science.<br />3. THE ACCUSERS JUDGE ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL CHRISTIANS BY MODERN ETHICAL STANDARDS RATHER THAN IN THEIR OWN CONTEXT.  To call Paul a sexist ignores the fact that, unlike his Pagan contemporaries, Paul taught that husbands owed strict obligations to their wives.<br />I expect that the detractors of Christianity will never read this book.  The Christian should read it, then, to be able to correct the damage done by those who make false claims against it.	2001-12-12

This is a fundamental text for religious scholarship and for living an examined life.<br />Eliade wastes no time trying to explain or define the experience of the sacred in terms of other disciplines (for instance, the sacred as psychological experience (Campbell) or the sacred as sociological phenomenon (Burkert)).  Instead, he examines the sacred as sacred.<br />Eliade shows how sacred space and sacred time are supremely REAL space and time, permanent and eternal in opposition to the fluid space and time of the profane world.  Homo religiosus re-enacts the primordial deeds of the gods in his rites and, indeed (unlike modern man), in all his acts, because only those primordial acts are truly real.  Likewise, irruptions of sacred phenomena into profane space create sacred space, space which is created, which is eternal, which is real.<br />Read this book before undertaking any serious study of comparative religion.  Read this book along with other classics about thought.  Read this book and consider your own experience of the sacred.  But whatever you do, read this book.	2001-12-10

Rather, I intend to warn readers that _The Dream Palace of the Arabs_ it is not a work of chronological accounting and crisp historical analysis.<br />Instead, it is impressionistic and non-linear.  Events are narrated as episodes in the life or from the perspective of a certain poet or political figure.  This gives the book a dreamy, subjective quality.  This, surely, is the point: not to answer a specific historical question, but to tell the tale of &quot;a generation's odyssey&quot;, as the book's subtitle has it.<br />The result is effective and haunting in its sense of disillusionment and frustration, and I recommend the book highly.<br />The one caveat I offer is that the reader will get much more out of this book if s/he has already read at least some Middle Eastern history, and preferably a fair amount.	2001-12-05

They're mobilized, they're motivated, and they're out to get you.  Okay, maybe not YOU, specifically...not yet.  The essays in this collection reveal leftist individuals and organizations at work, putting their agenda -- the consolidation of their own power by the destruction of existing American institutions -- into action.<br />The title is mystifying.  Many of the essays contained in this volume relate to American universities (one of the first redoubts to be siezed by the Raving Left).  Others, though, deal with issues and incidents as diverse as fascist feminism's assault on the US military and a social workers' crusade against the &quot;patriarchal&quot; family.<br />Still, give it to your college-bound friend or relative.

Pryce-Jones explores the question why there are no modern Arab liberal democracies.<br />He finds the answer in Arab social and political culture, specifically:<br />1. TRIBALISM.  Pryce-Jones argues that Arab culture doesn't encourage Arabs to identify themselves as members of a state, but as members of a family or tribe.  Arab political life therefore consists of a multitude of warring factions, none of whom seeks the good of the nation as a whole.  As Karl Popper might describe it, they ask only the personal question &quot;Who should rule?&quot; (and answer: &quot;I should!&quot;) and never ask the more fundamental institutional question &quot;How should power be organized?&quot;<br />2. THE SHAME / HONOR SYSTEM.  Arabs place great weight on perceptions of their honor.  This consideration therefore often trumps all others and results in behavior that looks, to western eyes, like insanity.<br />An example is the Aswan dam.  Nasser announces that he will build the dam and that it will be a great thing, thereby committing his honor to its construction and success.  Therefore, when his own experts tell him that the dam is a bad idea (it will disrupt agriculture, increase the spread of some diseases, etc.), he suppresses the information and does not back down.  When the Eisenhower administration revokes the promised funding for the dam (because it's a bad idea), Nasser's honor has committed him so fully to the dam that he reverses his foreign policy 180 degrees and cuddles up to the Soviet Union to get it done.  And when the dam, as predicted, turns out to be a curse rather than a blessing, Nasser goes on shouting its virtues.<br />3. THE POWER-CHALLENGE DIALECTIC.  You're either in power in the Arab world, in which case you're paranoid and watching your subordinates and allies as closely as your enemies, or you're no, in which case you lurk in the shadows, plot and scheme until your hand is ready and you make your move to challenge the power holder.  There is no notion of shared power, no notion of purely institutional power.<br />THEREFORE...<br />The result is that calls for democracy, like calls for socialism, Palestinian independence and even repentance and return to the true tenets of Islam, are bogus.  They mask what would otherwise be naked grabs for power by an individual or a tribal group.  The Arabs are constantly and consistently betrayed by their leaders.<br />Note that this is NOT a book about Islam.  Pryce-Jones explicitly argues that this Arab culture pre-dates Islam and that Islam itself is often used as a tool or a pretext in power challenges (as in Wahhabism, for instance).tion of shared power, no notion of purely institutional power.<br />THEREFORE...<br />The result is that calls for democracy, like calls for socialism, Palestinian independence and even repentance and return to the true tenets of Islam, are bogus.

This book is almost intimidating in its detail, but for a self-teaching writer I recommend it above the others because:<br />1. MORE DETAILED STRUCTURE.  Frensham breaks down the structure of a script into smaller, tighter detail than simply having three acts, or three plot points.  Once you know the material, cliche cliche, you can play with it, but it's revealing to see how the whole thing hangs together.<br />2. MORE KINDS OF STRUCTURE.  Having broken movie structure down by scene and climaxes, Frensham then proceeds to break it down by sequences.  Additional analytical tools give you more ways to think about a movie and therefore more ways to diagnose the illnesses of your own writing.<br />3. EXERCISES.  Frensham explains a concept and then gives you homework.  Go watch movies A, B, C and D and identify X, Y and Z about them.  Great practice, and once you've done it with the films you know, it becomes very easy to do it with new films.<br />4. ALL ABOUT WRITING.  Frensham wastes very little time on trying to tell you how to second guess the reader, the producer or the market or whining about pet peeves or sharpening his ax for bloodshed. There is some information about marketing, but mostly this book is what it declares itself to be in its title -- a tool for teaching yourself to write.<br />Bon appetit.	2001-12-03

Rowling may have pilfered from this classic (on his 11th birthday, the boy discovers he has magical power; his scar wards off evil; etc.).  What do the books of the Dark Is Rising sequence have that Harry Potter does not?<br />1. Mythos.  The Dark Is Rising sequence comes complete with its own universe, myths, cosmic clashes and even eschatology.  Like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the Dark Is Rising lives and breathes in a very complete world.<br />In fact, Cooper's mythology is adapted (and not adapted very much) from genuine British folklore and myth.  Herne the Hunter, the Drowned Hundred, the Holy Grail, etc.<br />This gives the books a very &quot;real&quot;, very British feel to them and a lot of depth.  It also means that enjoyment of these books translates quite easily into an interest in British and Celtic history and myth.<br />2. Ethos.  Will Stanton comes into his powers and inherits grave, serious responsibilities.  The Light is engaged not in frivolous games involving broomsticks, but an eternal battle against the forces of the Dark, which seek to destroy humanity.  The Light is love and self-sacrifice; the Dark is hatred and exploitation.<br />3. Just Plain Good Writing.	2001-11-30

To call it a good \\"adventure book\\" or to note that modern fantasy literature is virtually all just sincere flattery of Tolkien or to observe that Tolkien's own precedents were epic and mythological literature or to wonder at the depth, consistency, beauty and, above all, REALITY of Tolkien's Middle Earth is to damn with faint praise.  Read it again.  There is always something more.<br />What struck me during my most recent reading was the deeply Christian ethos of the book.  The ring is, of course, the power to indulge one's pride, the capacity for ultimate self-aggrandizement.  The heroes of the west are all great because they are all able to deny themselves that power: Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, even Boromir (after a moment's slip) are all great because they are humble.  There's a wonderful passage in Mordor where Sam is wearing the ring and sees himself as the irresistible gardener, striding through the wasteland with a flaming sword and using the power of the ring to restore the land.  It's delightful characterization and powerful writing.<br /> (...)	2001-11-28

I now consider myself a secular humanist who believes that all religions are sick men's dreams, false -- demonstrably false -- and pernicious&quot; (page xiii).<br />If you're looking for a dispassionate discussion of Islam, this is not it.  Ibn Warraq is quite clear about his contempt for Islam (rites on the Hajj are described as &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;superstition[s]&quot; (page 37); Islam is described as containing &quot;gross superstitious elements&quot; (page 48); the Koran is derided for not giving any &quot;philosophical argument&quot; for the existence of God (page 118...and what scriptural text DOES give such arguments?); Muhammad has a &quot;limited imagination&quot; (page 125); and so on)and for other faiths and religion generally (&quot;early Christians fabricated details of the life of Jesus in order to answer doctrinal point&quot; (page 153); &quot;the beyond [i.e., the afterlife] is a way for the self-proclaimed prophets and priests to retain control, to terrorize people with the tortures of hell, and equally to seduce them with the licentious pleasures of paradise&quot; (page 156); and more).<br />Ibn Warraq's prejudice leads him to repeat embarassingly simplistic and demonstrably false myths about the unique and savage brutality of monotheism, which gives us &quot;bloody madness of which the [blessedly polytheistic] ancients had no conception&quot;  (page 120).  Monotheism, we are told, &quot;inevitably leads to totalitarianism&quot; and a God who is a &quot;male chauvinist...insensitive to 'femininity'&quot;  (page 123).<br />So Ibn Warraq in some ways comes across as more of an unreasoning fanatic than the objects of his criticism (Al-Ghazali, for example, whom he trashes).<br />Nevertheless, there is value in this book.  If your introduction to Islam consists of the sunny-side-up adulation and praise that university courses on the subject typically give, this book will give you a good and accessible introduction to some interesting and problematic areas of Islamic history, e.g., variant readings of the Koran, the lateness of sources for Muhammad's life and sayings, the nature of the Arab expansion, Arab treatment of non-Arab and non-Muslim populations in the dar al-Islam, etc.<br />Just don't expect Ibn Warraq to be nice.ny-side-up adulation and praise that university courses on the subject typically give, this book will give you a good and accessible introduction to some interesting and problematic areas of Islamic history, e.g., variant readings of the Koran, the lateness of sources for Muhammad's life and sayings, the nature of the Arab expansion, Arab treatment of non-Arab and non-Muslim populations in the dar al-Islam, etc. <br />Just don't expect Ibn Warraq to be nice.	2001-11-26

In addition to its definitions, it contains various \\"miscellaneous lists\\" of Welsh suffixes, prefixes, foreign terms, place names, plants, animals, etc.<br />The Geiriadur, published in 1958, has since been updated.  The new definitions, however, have not been inserted into the text, but into a supplement (atodiad) at the end of each section.  This is where you'll find really useful Welsh words like \\"uwchddargludedd\\" (superconductivity).	2001-11-21

Grossman does not in every case write out the notation for the entire song; a song might be represented by its intro, first verse and closing guitar lick, or maybe just by an extended break.  In each case, Grossman gives you enough information that you can sit down with the recording and learn to play these classic songs.<br />Interview snippets, history and photographs add great color and texture to an extremely useful work.	2001-11-20

I continue to come back to it for refreshers.<br />If you don't know any Hebrew yet, or you know very little, this book is not going to teach it to you. Spend some time with a good book-and-tape set, take a course, then buy Glinert.	2001-11-15

The highly intelligent largely work and associate with other highly intelligent people.  They marry each other, and have highly intelligent kids.  Murry and Herrnstein argue that an intelligence-derived class system is developing in America.<br />Of course, it has even more ominous implications for people whose political credos rest upon the assumption that everything about an individual is socially conditioned and can therefore be improved by enlightened tinkering.  These people, predictably, respond with wild accusations of &quot;Nazi science!&quot;  This, of course, is a blatant and somewhat pathetic effort to taint the book so that no one will touch it.<br />Ignore the screamers.  Read this book.	2001-11-06
