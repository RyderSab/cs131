But it has quite disappointed myself... it reminded me so much of &quot;Splinters of a minds eye&quot; which centered on Luke's second encounter with Vader face to face but you had to read 300 pages of boring pages until you got to the interesting part.<br />In this book you learn of Mace's journey back to his home planet in his search of his missing Padawan: Depa. Depa had been on a mission to make the local Guerrilla join the Republic and fight the planetary forces which had joined the Separatists.<BR>You will see how Mace finds out by himself how has his ability to control the force diminished and lost many of his capabilities. <br />But I was mentioning before that you the good thing was in the last pages. It's true. You have to endure boring chapters and chapters of Mace's adventures in the jungle until you find interesting stuff. This almost made me leave the book but somehow managed to keep on reading.<br />The story is not bad, but it could have shortened to a 200 page book, and you would have gotten the same...	2004-06-15

His books are still good after all this time and even better!<br />The story goes about a professor who receives a note from his father, who is dying of cancer and hasn't gotten along very well, asking him please to come back to the hometown for discussing his last will.<br />As soon as he arrives, he finds his father dead and discovers more than 3 million dollars in cash hidden inside a cabinet. No time has he to think about this &quot;mostly unusual&quot; discovery when his younger brother, an addict and the family's disgrace, arrives.<br />The professor decides to hide his finding from almost everyone, except one person who knows about the money too and tries to recover it...<br />The plot is really well written, entertaining and has an almost unusual and perhaps unexpected ending...	2004-04-26

Oddly, but not enough with his scruples, he agreeds to it and suddenly becomes the new &quot;wunderkind&quot; of Class action attorneys, getting the attraction of colleagues and the envy of many others.<BR>Not to spoil the whole story, the plot (superbly narrated as usual) goes around the rise to the pinnacle of this young guy and his abrupt and profound fall, leaving you with a moral precept.	2004-02-02

He is quite outspoken and spits out things in some straightforward and perhaps rude way.<BR>If that's ok for you and you are interested in trivia things, then I reccommend this book to you.<BR>This is the very first book of his set of 4 and covers most of the most interesting articles appeaered on his column at the Chicago Reader since 1973.<BR>Cecil is an eccentric guy who claims to be the &quot;smartest&quot; guy who knows it all around the world. its said he has devoted a whole house to compile and archive articles and data of various aspects deriving from Biology to Laws.<BR>Tip: you can find most of his articles on line, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to read a couple of them first and find out your likeness for his way of writing.	2003-06-19

Instead, if you want to read more about curious and exotic things, I would reccommend Cecil Adams' Straight dope or the best one in these fields: Isaac Asimov.	2003-04-24

You can find the things most reccommended to do if you want to start up your own enterprise (that was the proffesor's goal I think) but sharing at the same time his sufferings, successes and setbacks. It's not only the &quot;technical&quot; aspect but the &quot;emotional&quot; aspect as well.<BR>I am glad I had read it, it's very inspiring and you cannot but admire Howard Schultz for his perseverance and push.	2003-04-24

Raised originally by Julius Caesar around 61 BC while in charge of the governorship of Farther Spain (nowadays Andalucia) he personally raised and trained a Legion originally meant for his conquest of Portugal and which would later become a part of history.<br />The author tells us how Caesar trained the legion, took it to Lusitania (Portugal) for its baptism of fire, and how it played a key and vital role in the Invasion of Britain and the querrel of Vercingetorix's rebellion in the Gaul. <BR>Apart from that, he mentions anecdotes about Roman lifestyle and traditions whenever possible, making it more enjoyable.<br />I strongly reccomend this book for everyone interested in digging more about Roman History and Military Tradition.	2002-12-20
