US	50950924	RZ9C9HUG05AA2	0778321029	155889289	Another Man's Son (MIRA)	Books	2	5	5	N	N	Not deeply emotional or truly romantic as cover states...	The book started out well enough but it quickly lost me about half way through when there were too many storylines going on and not near enough time spent on what the book is supposed to be about according to the back cover.  It states that 'within weeks' Sam has fallen in love with Kathleen.  They didn't meet until 3/4 of the way through the book, on the night Ian died, and they were in love the next morning, not within weeks. I thought, for someone as frigid as Kathleen was, it was a bit unbelievable that she slept with Sam within an hour or two of meeting him and then I didn't know they had until I began reading the next chapter.  I don't think the author spent near enough time on the issues of the two characters (Sam's abandonment of his father and Kathleens' loss of the man she loved) and apparently they were all settled within one conversation that was not near emotional or romantic. They knew each other less than a week at the end of the book (and most of that time was spent dealing with Natalie, James and Grant) and apparently, the author forgot to send the pages to the publisher where they discussed any future they might have together or even if they wanted one together.  The subplot of Natalie and James was unnecessary and again, the author spent more time on their relationship, with insecure Natalie unsure of how James felt, than she did on Sam and Kathleen's.  Grant's storyline was silly and if it was meant to throw a twist in the whole story, get me on the edge of my seat, it failed because nobody really cared about Grant, Christine, James or Natalie.  I would have liked to have read a whole lot more about Sam and Kathleen and maybe their feelings for each other as they grew to know each other but it was never really touched on.  The book jumped all over but never seemed to center on Kathleen and Sam.  I wouldn't recommend it.  It was boring and goofy.  The only reason I gave it two stars was for the very beginning.	2005-04-06

The only book I read after the OJ trial was Chris Darden's In Contempt.  After reading it, I was convinced OJ was the killer, though I'd never doubted it.  Then along came this book and for lack of anything to read, I picked it up recently at my library.  The front boasts, \\"The First Full Investigation\\".  This book is nothing but ridiculous junk.  Like another reviewer who thought this guy (the author) might have been on the jury, I thought Simpson probably paid him to write it.  This entire waste of paper is about--put simply--everything the prosecution did wrong and how inept they all were and everything the defense did right and how brilliant they all were.  All I read is how wrong, wrong, wrong the prosecution was.  Well here's a newsflash.  Neither Marcia Clark or Chris Darden witnessed the murders, therefore they cannot and never will be absolutely certain how everything went down there that night.  The only one who knows that is the killer and I still believe, after reading this rubbish, that OJ is that person.  This book was geared to steer guilt away from OJ and point it anywhere else but at him.   <br /> <br />There is a line in the book that says, \\"Picture a killer with a knife in a struggle against 2 strong, fit victims and dangerous guard dog\\", with the author once again trying to steer OJ out of the crime.  1.  The dog knew OJ.  2.  It's pretty difficult to put up much of a fight when one, you've been whacked in the head and then two, your throat is slashed so viciously that both jugular veins are severed. <br /> <br />Then we're told that LAPD logged a 911 call at 10:30 and the caller asked if a double murder had been reported. The author explains, \\"Did someone--perhaps even OJ--pass by Bundy, see what happened and report it anonymously?\\"  Portraying OJ as an innocent witness.  Why couldn't OJ have had someone call because it was possible he was concerned about his children being there alone after he killed his wife and her friend?  Is it possible hedidn't want the kids to see the carnage he left behind?  Why not that point of view?  And if OJ had been the one behind the call, what kind of man would witness (if he's innocent like the author believes) a murder at the place his children reside, then go home, hop on a plane and head to Chicago?  And aren't 911 calls immediately traceable? <br /> <br />A big deal was made about the bruises on Ron's knuckles while putting up a fight?  Obviously, according to the book, he hit the killer several times.  There were also scrapes on his knuckles, according to the autopsy report.  So, instead of hitting someone that should be bruised in turn and OJ was not bruised so he can't be guilty--isn't it possible Ron's fists hit the pavement as he fell?  The author keeps telling us about the bruised knuckles but fails to tell us there were also abrasions on those knuckles, which I don't believe would get there simply from punching someone.  But the author doesn't speculate that the bruises could have occurred when he fell. <br /> <br />Then there is \\"Nicole & Ron - Amended Timeline\\"--So the author now would have us believe that Ron is in Nicole's house preparing to bathe, Nicole is out front talking to someone for almost a half hour when someone hears a woman's scream.  The author assumes this is Nicole's scream, so I have to assume that Ron comes out to help her, right?  Yes, according to the author.  So before he comes back out of the house to assist her, he grabs the keys and the envelope with the glasses and runs to her assistance?  Because those two things are photographed by his body.  That idea is just nonsense. <br /> <br />Further into the book, the author says, \\"Let us for now eliminate Simpson as a suspect\\".  You mean, he actually was a suspect somewhere in this garbage?  The last few chapters of the book have Ron being the target, Faye Resnick being the target and OJ being the target.  A professional hit?  A professional hit done so sloppily?  And if Ron were the target, why wasn't he killed at his apartment instead of outside Nicole's house?  If OJ was the target, why is the man still alive today?  If Resnick was the target, why is she still alive today?  All the wasted pages of drugs and sex and mafia and the other mumbo jumbo is all speculation.   <br /> <br />The \\"two killer timeline\\" is also a laugh.  That Nicole would call Mezzaluna and ask Ron to come over at 9:42 if he is the man she is sleeping with and then \\"Nicole's date arrives\\" (another man) at 9:44.  At 10:00, she's done with this date (?) and walks him out to the car, then goes back inside at 10:05 and 'in preparation for Goldman's arrival, she slips back into her dress'.  WHAT?  So now, the ruckus begins at 10:31 and continues until 10:45?  An attack that lasts nearly 15 minutes, where supposedly Ron and Nicole are fighting viciously back and all we hear is one thing from Ron and one little scream from Nicole?  I don't think so. <br /> <br />The book is an entire waste of paper.  We don't know what exact time these two people were killed, although I'm guessing that it was very close to 10:03 when Nicole's watch stopped.  But then, according to the author, OJ can't be the killer because he was making a cellphone call that noone answered at 10:03.  Is it possible (???) that Nicole's watch could have been a minute or two off?  Now there's an idea.  OJ pulls up, makes the call to try to create a flimsy alibi, gets out of his bronco and proceeds to attack her?  I'm guessing that Nicole was attacked first and was in the process of being killed by her psycho ex-husband when Ron came upon the attack, yelled, \\"Hey, hey, hey\\", tried to intervene and then he was killed?  I don't believe one killer attacked both of them at once.  Why didn't the author address the photograph that was produced after the trial of OJ wearing Bruno Magli shoes?  The author portrays OJ as being the one who is stalked by Nicole.  Give me a break.  He admitted looking in her windows.   <br /> <br />Irealize my review is somewhat confusing, but so was this entire book.  It threw a hundred different scenarios out at you and I think they were meant to confuse.  None of them made any sense and I think Simpson is just as guilty today even after reading this junk.	2005-02-10

I'm not a huge fan of true crime but I was looking for one that my husband wanted to read and saw this on the shelf, so needing something to read, I bought it.  It was a gripping, hard to put down read and absolutely terrifying.  Jeff Gorton was apparently, just a normal guy living a normal life, who'd even fooled his wife of several years.  A loving father, a good friend, a nice looking guy.  But the murders he committed were so awfully gruesome.  I can't imagine the terror the victims felt when he descended on them.  And I have a hard time understanding how, after doing something so awful, this man was able to carry on with his life as if nothing at all had happened.  It was just so strange.  I've never in my life read such a disturbing story.  My heart goes out to both the Eby family and Arthur Ludwig and for all they have endured as a result of this man.  If you like reading true crime, this is definitely a must read.  But be prepared, it is terribly graphic and gruesome.	2005-01-12

Given a choice, I wouldn't have given this book one measly star, but I was forced to.  I've just finished the book (how, I don't know) and I'm glad it's over because if I had to read one more chapter beginning with wonderful Gerry Starrett sitting in her immaculate living room, holding hands with her perfect family, reflecting on the perfect previous years and 'her Danny', I was going to puke. I found this book to be more about the trials of Gerry Starrett than her son.  I never read anything about the victims and their families.  And I read very little about Danny's family (except for his strange mother) and nothing about his wife after all this except the two or three paragraphs when she asked for a divorce.  Personally, it sounded to me as if Gerry was just a tad obsessed with her son and even after he confessed, she didn't believe 'her Danny' did anything.  The guy was a freak and if his mother and he were as close as she claims they were, you think she would have seen some abnormalities in him.  Granted, I can understand her desire to help her son but she attacked everybody around him and I got just plain sick of hearing about all the injustices that he was made to endure.  He did, after all, rape a bunch of teenagers and kill one of them Gerry.  If the purpose of this book--and it seemed to be that Gerry was the only participant in the writing of this book--was to conjure up sympathy for 'her Danny', it failed miserably.  The only sympathy I felt for him was the embarrassment of having such a weird mother. (Example: her screaming at the prosecutor for mentioning the murder victim's name when 'her Danny' fell on the floor crying)  She was just over the edge.  She seemed extremely shallow, more worried about appearances than anything else.  I actually thought her husband handled things much better than she did and I kept wondering when he was going to unload his half-crazed wife.  As it turned out, she filed for divorce.  As I said, I did manage to finish this book, but if you haven't read it, I wouldn't bother with it.  It's nothing but a bunch of babble.  It's actually a story about an anguished mother of a murderer than anything else.	2005-01-12

After reluctantly giving Material Girl a three star rating and not being overly excited about reading Beauty Queen (I would though because I love JL's books), I was really happy when I got to the end of the book and thoroughly enjoyed the entire book from page one to the end.  Matt Parrish was as intriguing and as exciting a hero as Julian Dane (Ruthless Charmer), Arthur Christian (Beautiful Stranger), The Duke (Wicked Angel), and we can't forget Michael Ingram (A Devil's Love).  It was fun to watch this romance develop through the book and how they rediscovered themselves with the help of each other.  However, I did think after the blow out at the Four Seasons, it should have been her apologizing to him and not vice versa.  She did string him along and she was a bit 'empty' and she knew Matt was right but JL had him groveling, which is usually what happens in most her novels, even if the heroine is wrong.  And though it's fun to watch the hero grovel occasionally, Matt was the perfect hero and Rebecca was the one with the issues.  But all in all, I really enjoyed it, could hardly put it down.  Her writing was witty, her characters believable, and it made for another page turner by an extremely talented writer.	2004-12-02

Second, I'd like to express my sympathy to Dave for having to endure such a horrific childhood.  There were a couple times I put it down and almost didn't pick it back up.  I remember once I looked at my nine year old son across the room watching television while I was reading and wondered what kind of person does this kind of hurt to a young boy? How can anyone even want to make their kids hurt like that?  How can anyone enjoy inflicting this kind of pain on someone so helpless? I don't even like to see my son sad; I couldn't imagine being the one to cause it all.  I haven't read the other two, though I have the second book here to read now.  And now I have to read the rest of them because I have to know that this young boy survived and I have to know that he found someone that loved him and I have to know that he's alright today.  And if his mother would happen to read any of these reviews, I would like to tell her what a disgusting excuse for a human being she is.  And his father wasn't much better.  In fact, he was the biggest coward for allowing that to go on for all those years.  But it's his mother that sickened me the most.	2004-10-01

I smiled when I read that dedication, whom I'm assuming is her husband, who sounds as much fun as she is.  I would have given this book more stars had I been able to.  This is my favorite of Julia Quinn's books, followed somewhat closely by Romancing Mister Bridgerton and Everything and the Moon.  I've read everything she's written and the only disappointing one I've read is Eliose's story, which I didn't really care for.  She is one of my favorite authors, up there with Gaelen Foley and Julia London and my advice to new readers is to not be put off by the negative reviews of this book.  This was a beautifully written, touching love story.  Different from a lot of other books, Michael loved Francesca from page one.  And though the book was a bit more serious than some of her other work, I DID find plenty of witty dialogue and dry comments from both of the characters.  I had a hard time putting it down but when I had to, I couldn't wait until I could pick it up and start reading again.  My favorite scene was when Michael seduced her for the first time.  \\"Did you want to know,\\" he whispered, \\"what I did when I was wicked?\\"  I have to admit Chapter 17 left me running in search of my husband. The whole entire book was good.  From page one to the very last page.  Michael was perfect and his love for Francesca was so beautiful.  Definitely a must read!!!	2004-09-24

It was nice to read for a change a story about a real working class single mother, pinching pennies, driving a heap of a car and the fisherman who loves her.  It just seems like every book I read, everyone is rich.  I loved the relationship between Ethan and Seth.  It was those two that could really relate to each other.  The relationships are touching and it was fun to see Cam and Anna back in this one, still lusting after each other as much as they did in their story.  Though Ethan and Grace's story was my favorite, my favorite character is and remained through all four books, Cam.  He was a hard-a**ed guy but the possessiveness and love he felt toward Seth was touching.  All four books are very well written.  Don't miss any of them.	2004-03-03

Inner Harbor was my least favorite of the four in this series.  Though Phillip had his moments, he seemed the less connected to Seth.  Not quite as committed as the other two brothers.  And Sybill grated on my nerves through most of the book.  She was simply too cold.  However, the last third of the book she began to shine when she jumped on the Quinn's bandwagon and did everything she could to help them.  And I began to understand why she was like she was.  But I thought Phillip was a bit too pushy with her and I thought she was too frigid.  I did, however, enjoy her interaction with Seth and their storyline together.  I would have liked to see and waited to see a private conversation between Cam and her ending with his final acceptance of her into the family and Phillip's and Seth's life.  It did bring tears to my eyes a few times, like they all did.  And you have to love Anna.  She was the perfect rock that held the family together.  All in all, the entire series is one not to miss.  I was captivated from the very beginning and couldn't read fast enough to find out what would happen next.	2004-03-03

A few years ago, a friend gave me two Nora Roberts books and told me to read them, that they were excellent.  One was SeaSwept and the other was Rising Tides.  I read the inside flap and thought Nah, maybe sometime if I have nothing to read I'll read them.  They just didn't seem romantic enough for me to read as I'm a die hard romantic and like my books to have lots of it.  In a bookstore a couple weeks ago, I saw Roberts had a new book out.  Chesapeake Blue.  I bought it and began to read it a few days ago and could hardly put it down.  Seth is so witty and charming and lovable that you can't wait to hear what he says or does next.  As I read it, I put it together that this was book number 4 in a series.  I went to my bookcase and found the first two sitting there collecting dust.  From what I've read here on other reviews about this book, I can't wait to read the first three.  I finished Chesapeake Blue this morning and am now going to start at the beginning.  I can't wait to read Cam's story.  This book was a real piece of work and you won't be disappointed in it.  But beware...if you don't have a lot of time for reading, don't start it until you do otherwise nothing around the house is going to get done till you're through with it.	2004-02-23

I just finished reading this mod podge of a true crime book and I only have one question.  Are the prosecutors and cops really that dumb there?  I was completely shocked at the total lack of competence everyone involved exhibited except for the judge Benjamen.  Terrence Williams wins the dunce award for this one.  He says, &quot;We had a good case against them.&quot;  Every single page I turned, I kept waiting to read SOMETHING that would tie this foursome to the crime and I never read one shred of anything that even hinted they might have been involved.  His good case is bologna.  We have 4 guys that head to a bar on the night of the murder.  One gets out of the car (I'll get to him in a minute) and goes home.  The other three stop at a ATM, which apparently forgetting to mention such an insignificant thing was clearly an oversight since none of the men were asked to give a detailed blow-by-blow of every minute the previous night.  However, when one mentions it, the cops decide they're all guilty because they didn't mention it?  Piddily.  Then we have a handful of people who saw these three men at the bar for hours and they're not called as witnesses?  During the same time frame Lois is murdered, these men are seen in a bar and they're discounted as important?  That was their solid alibi.  But totally unimportant to the cops.  Why?  Because the cops wanted to pin this murder on them no matter what.  There were wet shoes at their house?  So what.  It means nothing.  There was no physical evidence linking them.  No motive.  No nothing byt an acquaintance between the men and the victim.  They couldn't find the man she'd been seen with only a short time before she was murdred so the cops just toss him aside.  The elusive cab driver lends credence to their guilt?  I'd have been elusive too.  He was probably afraid he'd be indicted along with them.  But everyone had the same story, even the cab driver.  Now William, I'm hesitant to say he's not guilty, although I think he probably is.  My only two problems with him were 1) he is unaccounted for at the time of her death and 2) He kept referring to her as Lois Livingston which lead me to believe he knew her better than he said.  Aside from that Vernon Malone says he is 100% convinced of his guilt based on the evidence collected.  Again I ask, What Evidence????  A sun blister on his nose?  That ended up being there the day before she was murdered.  It seemed that anything that could have been done to discount their guilt was purposely not done.  They took a camera from the house and don't bother to develop the film?  They zeroed in of these men right away and it was wrong.  Jo McMillen is the one who gave Luigi's name to police at the beginning of the book and then when asked to testify, says he hasn't been in the picture for so long it's not possible he did it.  How does Johnston tie Michael to the crim scene?  His shoes were wet?  Big deal.  However, I have read the previous reviewer's take on the whole thing and when I read it, I thought, Wow.  Possibly the author should have talked to a few more people on this island instead of just the accused and the cops.  I had gathered on my own that Lois didn't have many friends because she was a bit of a loner.  But was there evidence that we never heard about?  Were these guys really only there for 20 minutes the night she was killed or hours like the author lead us to believe?  At any rate, the book was tedious and boring and would have been better written by someone like Ann Rule.  The author kept repeating herself over and over and the book didn't follow much of a timeline.  I love the Caribbean.  However, I think I'll steer clear of Tortola.  Not because I'm afraid I'll be murdered there but because I could be arrested for one.  These guys were there on vacation and it ended up biting them in a big way.  I do find it hard to believe that these three guys killed her.  She had managed to run about 75 yards from her killer before he recaptured her.  I find it hard to believe she could have gotten away from three guys like the evidence showed.	2004-02-17

Though it wasn't dull or boring, it did seem to drag out longer than it needed to.  I didn't care for the constant name calling 'Hammerhead' 'Handyman' 'Slickster' etc.  That just is not her style.  And her hero wasn't near as alluring as her heroes in her historicals.  I actually hated to give this book only a 3 star rating, but I didn't enjoy it near as much as I did her other books............   However, I imagine she will come out with Rachel's story and Rebecca's story because when I got to the end of this book, it didn't seem like the saga was really over and the story was not done being told.  I will read her other books. She really is a wonderful author and you won't be disappointed with her other work if you liked this one.	2003-10-09

I read this book as soon as it hit the book shelves a couple years ago and I just read it again today.  I have to say this is one of Quinn's best.  Anthony Bridgerton is such a cad that you will be laughing through the entire book!  He's constantly doing things to anger Kate and they are just really funny.  I loved the game of Pall Mall, and being familiar with the other players of that game from her other books about them, it was fun to read again.  I laughed throughout the entire scene.  Quinn is a wonderfully witty writer.  She goes into just enough detail to make her books fun, but not enough that you're literally skipping over paragraphs to get to the good parts (like Judith McNaught's historicals).  I'm amazed how she comes up with just the right thing to write in just the right place.  An entertaining read!  Get her other books.  Romancing Mr. Bridgerton/Everything and the Moon/To Catch an Heiress/Brighter than the Sun/The Duke and I/How to Marry a Marquis/  they're all fun, light reads!	2003-09-23

It was a wonderful story, kind along the lines of something Nicholas Sparks would write.  But, it was a little too tear-jerking to put it down with a happy sigh when I was finished.  It was very powerful but it wasn't a really 'feel good' read.  With all the depressing things going on in the world today, I like to read things with a little happier note and not so much sadness.  However, it was good but it isn't something I'd read again.	2003-09-22

It was my first time travel I've read, though I've only read a few, and it is also one of my favorite all time historical romance novels.

It had everything...the lowly steelworker Matt Farrell, who is not nearly good enough (according to her domineering father) for Meredith Bancroft, and he will do whatever is necessary to separate the two.  Eleven years later, things get really good when Matt is back, and with a vengeance.  Even more wealthy and more powerful than the Bancrofts, he is determined to have his revenge on the family that snubbed him so badly.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the ghost plotline.  Without that, it would have been a much better read.  I enjoyed Hayden and his wit though I had trouble with the characters and their chemistry toward each other.  It wasn't a disappointing book by any means, but the whole ghost scenario had me a bit put off.  However, I think Medeiros is a wonderful author and really enjoyed reading her style of writing.  She is very talented and I will read her other books.	2003-09-19

I loved the whole trilogy and can't say that I have a favorite among the three.  However, I do agree with the other reviewers that said Allegra and Lazar were disappointing parents, but it was still a wonderful read.  You can't help but fall in love with Rafael for the hero positively oozes masculinity, as does Lazar in Pirate Prince and Darius in Princess.  The story begins quickly and never slows down.  I absolutely loved how they met and the scenes following that altercation on the road.  As with all Foley's work, I'm sure I'll read this one many times to come in the future.  She's a spectacular writer and for anyone that hasn't read her work, or even hasn't read ALL of her work, get her other books.  They're as entertaining and touching as Prince Charming.	2003-09-02

I just finished this book last night and I was surprised that I could hardly put this book down.  A very interesting read for anyone that's interested in history in the Caribbean.  My only complaint is that there wasn't much time spent on the nineteenth century and that's what I was really interested in reading about.  There's plenty about the 1600's and the 1700's, but very little about the 1800's.  I hadn't realized how volitale life was living on one of the Caribbean islands in that time period and the book contained some interesting stories.  All in all, an entertaining read.	2003-09-02

I was so looking forward to reading this book and in fact, when I bought it I was reading another that I finished with hasty anticipation of The Fifth Daughter.  I was misled by this book.  First, Elaine Coffman wrote The Italian, which I loved, so I expected much more when I read this.  Second, on the back of this book it says it is a stunning love story and on the binding it advertises itself as a historical romance.  Where is the romance?  And unless I've missed something, how is this a stunning love story?  Throughout the entire book, Percy appeared only a handful of times and then he was nothing but a doormat for Maresa.  She was nothing but a spoiled brat who treated him horribly.  I'm not sure why he even bothered with her because she had not one redeeming quality about her.  She was immature and selfish.  I could have done without the history lesson and maybe a little more romance.  Napoleon and his escapades were constantly crammed down my throat and I began to wonder if this was his story and a story about the war and that of Percy and Maresa's romance was nothing but a subplot.  I did read the entire book and agree with the reviewer that said the writing was choppy.  The dialogue was bad.  And the much anticipated love scene amounted to a couple sentences. As much as I enjoyed The Italian, this book wasn't worth the paper it was printed on.	2003-08-07

When I saw this book at the bookstore, I thought it would be a fun read, something different.  It was also my first Debbie Macomber book.  I was surprised at the good reviews this book got because I found it incredibly boring.  I couldn't stand Lindy.  She was a spoiled brat and that she fell in love with him so early on in the book only told me she was incredibly immature.  I was almost embarrassed for her in the one scene where she kept insisting to him she loved him.  I thought she made quite a fool out of herself.  And I couldn't help but roll my eyes when she gave him the ultimatum.  Rush was alright, but I never really knew what he looked like.  He was never really described except for being handsome.  Their conversations were shallow as were their lovemaking scenes. I did finish the book (although I'm not sure how) but it was incredibly stupid.  I think a much better story could have been written with the same plot.  A little deeper dialogue between the two might have helped and possibly a more mature heroine.  I hate to judge an author by reading just one book, so I will probably read another of her books because she is quite popular but I hope it will be better than this one was.  I got the impression this book was written in about two days given the shallowness of it.  With phrases like him leaving work like greased lightening and her asking him if he was king of the universe, it didn't seem like much thought was put into writing this.  And her expecting him to give up his job, as if he could just say I quit, was a bit much.  Then she said, when she learned he'd stay onboard, that she said she wouldn't be at the pier when he came home but she hadn't said anything about not being at the apartment.  And that was a bit ridiculous too.  Maybe I expect too much when I'm looking for a good book, but this just didn't cut it.  I'm curious though, what Harriet Klausner would say about this book because I follow her reviews and I seem to agree a lot with her assessment of books.  Was it just me or was this just a bit too cheesy to be good?	2003-08-03

However, I wish she would have concentrated more on their romance than who killed who.  Before I knew it, he was in love with her and he was much too understanding about the constant lying she did to him. There was a lot of beating around the bush when he was trying to get to the bottom of the murders also.  Nobody would give him a straight answer and again, I thought he was much too understanding for being a provost marshal.  But the story was good and I'm looking forward to reading more of her books.	2003-07-31

I was thrilled when I spotted her new book on the bookshelf, but I was less then thrilled when I began to read it.  The very first part of the book was alright, but then it fell into a slump until her brother Anthony came into the picture.  However, once he left, it was an incredibly boring read.  I was disappointed in this latest Bridgerton book, especially after reading Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, Colin's story.  This is actually the first book by Julia Quinn that I did not enjoy.  She's a wonderfully humorous, witty writer but she failed there too with this book.  I thought Phillip was too involved in his own pity party to really like him.  And Eloise was just a bit too perfect, a bit too controlling.  I didn't care at all for their first real love scene when they consummated their marriage.  It was over in a couple paragraphs and I could have done without the references as to how he took care of himself all those years.  But Quinn is a wonderful author.  I just hope she's not losing her magic.	2003-07-14

This was a wonderful love story between Darius and Serafina!  He was a truly magnificent hero.  That he was, in essence, one of her servants made it that much more fun!  The only problem I had with the book is that, if I remember right from Pirate Prince, Darius had been a slave to Malik in the first book and had suffered horribly at his hands, though that was never mentioned in Princess, instead his 'hell' had come from his parents.  I have to admit, I liked Lazar better in Pirate Prince and I didn't care for Allegra's attitude when she found the two of them together, especially after reading about her indiscretions in Pirate Prince, she should have been a bit more sympathetic to Serafina.  But when the guitar was found on Serafina's bed, it brought tears to my eyes, and when he came back to her, the scene was so poignant and touching, you couldn't help but fall in love with the dark warrior.  I also loved what he told Pauline Bonaparte!  All in all, I loved the story and can't wait to read Prince Charming!	2003-06-17

This is, without a doubt, the best historical romance I have read to date.  I read her Knight brothers novels and loved them so I decided to buy her earlier books and stayed up until 3 o'clock to finish Pirate Prince.  I didn't want it to end.  Lazar is the perfect, tortured hero and Allegra is the perfect woman for him.  I have to admit that while I read this book, I fell completely in love with Lazar, but how could it be helped? I laughed with him, I cried with him. It grabbed my attention from the very first page and at the end of the book, all I could do was sigh.  Foley is a spectacular writer, in fact I'm awed with her ability to write just the perfect words page after page after page!  Today, I start Princess and can hardly wait, if it's anything at all like Pirate Prince.  Then Prince Charming and then I'll have to wait for her to publish another one.

I agree with the reader from Sacramento and am also surprised at the high rating this book received.  I'm not sure how readers can even compare this book to some of her other work. I was completely bored with it and only kept reading it because of Brown's reputation as a great author, hoping it would improve.  And she is a great author, but I don't seem to enjoy her contemporary romances.  This book was dull (putting it mildly) compared to her other books.  Her historicals are good.  Her suspense/romance are wonderful, but her contemporaries just don't cut it.  But for the reader in Sacramento, don't give up on Brown.  She really is a spectacular author, even though if her name hadn't been on the cover of this book, I never would have guessed that she wrote it. In fact, after reading some of her books such as Tiding of Great Joy, Standoff and this one, I sometimes wonder if there is someone else out there parading around as Sandra Brown. I've been consistently disappointed with her just plain romances.  I recently read Envy and I couldn't put it down.  It's a top notch read.  I also loved the Alibi, Witness, Fat Tuesday,Breath of Scandal, Mirror Image, to name a few.  But those books had quite a bit of suspense/thriller plot to them and that's where she shines.  After reading Texas Chase, I'm not in a big hurry to read the other two in the trilogy.  The only reason I gave this book 1 star is because I had to.	2003-05-14

Kat Martin is a wonderful author and I only have to see her name on the front and I'm assured of a great read.  Caleb Tanner is the perfect hero and Lee Durant is the perfect heroine.  It couldn't have been written any better.  It's actually quite a touching love story and I enjoy reading books where the hero and heroine don't hate each other throughout much of the book, only to end up together in the end.  The stories are so much more enjoyable when they're similar to this one.  Read this, along with all her other books.  I've been a fan of hers since I read Captain's Bride years ago.

I bought this book because of an excerpt I read in another of Delinsky's books and the excerpt involved Micah and Heather.  Though this was a wonderful book, I was disappointed that it didn't focus more on what was going on between Micah and Heather.  We never really got to know them because not much of this book was focused on their relationship.  Yes, he loved her, but they had a lot of issues to deal with and none were ever dealt with.  They never had one heart to heart talk through the entire book and I would have liked to see more of what went on between these two, like we did with Poppy and Griffin.  I did enjoy the book, however, and I have to say it's my favorite Delinsky book so far.  But Micah was the perfect hero and I thought he should have had more of a storyline other than making syrup.	2003-03-16

When I read Lord of Ice (my favorite), and read the scene where Jacinda sees Billy for the first time and is intrigued with him, I thought it would be great to pair these two up in a story of their own. I was thrilled to see that that's what Foley did.  I had to wonder how she would ever get the Knight brothers to approve such a match between their little sister and a gangster, but she did it wonderfully.

I read this book and I have to say by the time I reached the end of it, I wasn't sure whether she killed her sons or not.

Unless you've been there, noone can imagine what goes through your mind when something this horrendous happens to your own kids.  However, I just read the review from the reader who actually knew her and we didn't hear anything about her screaming at her kids.

I just can't imagine what goes through someone's mind that would do something like this to their own children.  You don't want to believe there are people out there like that, but there are.  And that the reader is expected to believe that she actually slept through the murder of her two children while she slept just a few feet away is almost unbelievable.  That the killer saved her for last, the one person who might be able to thrawt his plan is hard to believe also.  You think he would have gotten her first.

I just can't imagine what goes through someone's mind that would do something like this to their own children.  You don't want to believe there are people out there like that, but there are.  And that the reader is expected to believe that she actually slept through the murder of her two children while she slept just a few feet away is almost unbelievable.  That the killer saved her for last, the one person who might be able to thrawt his plan is hard to believe also.  You think he would have gotten her first.  I'm not sure what to think about this, but apparently the author should have done a little more research.	2002-12-14

She's such a wonderful author too that I find it hard to believe she could publish a book that is so incredibly boring.  I usually enjoy her books but this one was a waste of time to read.  Sorry...  However, if you're looking for a great Sandra Brown book to read, try The Alibi, The Witness, Breath of Scandal or Tiger Prince to name a few.  They were all fantastic.	2002-12-14

The back cover made the book sound as if it was going to be much more exciting that it actually was.  Graham and Amanda's storyline got to be a bit monotonous, but it did give you an idea what childless couples go through trying to have a baby.  However, this is not really my kind of book.  It was a bit too slow paced for me though some people might really enjoy it as it deals with a lot of real to life issues.  The father to Gretchen's baby was a bit of a disappointment too.  I expected a more explosive ending.  I gave this book three stars because it wasn't awful, but it wasn't really exciting either.	2002-12-14

Matthew Lassiter is just the kind of guy every girl would like to meet.  He's handsome, he's a little dangerous, he's very loyal and he always says just the right thing at the right time.  It was interesting to read about deep sea diving, though I have to think if it were that easy to discover sunken Spanish galleons teaming with gold, we'd all be scouring the ocean floor.  There is definitely enough suspense to make this story interesting and there are a few surprises also.  There were times the storyline got a bit monotonous but overall it was a great read.	2002-12-13

Alexander is the perfect, sexy, caring hero.  And Isabelle is a wonderful match for him.  I enjoyed the humor, the dialogue and the storyline.

I didn't finish this book and maybe I should have given it more of a chance, although from reading the other two reviews, I don't think I missed anything.  I couldn't get into it from the beginning.  It bored me silly and I made it about 100 pages before I finally gave up hoping it would get better.  The very first turnoff for me was the first love scene.  \\"I'll make you quiver for me\\" did nothing but turn my stomach.  The whole scene would have been much better if Robert would have kept his arrogant mouth shut.  Everything he said to her was a complete turnoff.  The next thing that bothered me was her slapping him all the time.  She was definitely slap-happy.  And that he constantly took it and did nothing but rub his red cheek was another turnoff.  The hauling around the dead corpse was gross too.  All I could think of was the stench as Robert flung the man over his shoulder and put him back in his grave.  And doing that to make a few bucks, come on!  Like I said, I couldn't get past 100 pages although I did read the last few pages of the book and they weren't any better.  They were just as ridiculous as the beginning.	2002-12-03

I thought it was a very catchy title standing out among all the other books on the shelf.  I haven't read too many books that take place during or after the Civil War, but I was really impressed with this book.  The characters were wonderful and fit well together, although I thought Shannon was a bit too agressive when facing enemies.  And aside from Malachi having to rescue her over and over again and giving the reader the feeling that you were reading the same thing over again, it was an entertaining book.  I read it in one day.  It's definitely worth reading if you're a romance buff.	2002-11-24

I loved this book and the love story between Beatrice and Angelo, though there were a few things that bothered me.  The story began with the two of them already well acquainted and really left you to wonder what had happened between them 5 years before.  It also ended too soon, with the reader not knowing what would become of them.  An epilogue would have been good.  There were a lot of issues that were talked about in the book, but were never resolved.  However, this is a good book and I found it hard to put down.  It's not real light reading, but the romance is wonderful and you will love Angelo and his love for Beatrice.	2002-11-10

Then I read Guardian Angel and loved that one too.  Then I read Prince Charming and couldn't believe they were written by the same author.  The book was a complete bore but kept reading hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  Taylor was bossy, overbearing, unfeeling and a know-it-all.  Lucas was a charming hero, but I actually enjoyed Hunter and Victoria more in this book, though there wasn't much of a storyline involving them.  It got kind of monotonous the way we had to know every little thing the children did and I thought it amazing how she stepped into the role of mother to 3 kids that weren't hers (it irritated me the way it was 'her son' and 'her daughter'and 'his son' and 'his daughter')was so perfect at it.  She had no flaws and I can't understand what the attraction was between her and 'Mr. Ross'.  The plot was boring and the story was not entertaining at all. It also focused very little on how the hero and heroine really felt about each other.  Her style of writing was much different in this book than in the other two I mentioned and while I couldn't put the other two down, I had trouble getting myself to pick this one up and trudging on with it.  It seemed as if it had been thrown together.  I do have other books I recently bought of hers, but one reviewer said they weren't good and if they are written anything at all like this one, they probably aren't.	2002-10-04

This was my first Stephanie Laurens book and it will probably be my last.  I couldn't even finish it, I was so bored.  I didn't connect with Martin and Amanda at all and I'm not quite sure how they connected with each other because it was never really dealt with by the time I got 2/3 of the way through the book.  I quit reading when all they did was meet on terrace after terrace and steal a kiss and then he'd go off into the night, promising to meet her at the next ball.  For another kiss?  And I wasn't quite sure if she really liked the man or if it was all a big game for her.  She was much too sure of herself.  I also didn't care for the detail.  There was too much of it and this wasn't a \\"light read\\".  It drove me crazy the way the author would carry on a sentence, like, \\"She kissed him long, lingeringly.\\"  and \\"she laughed seductive, sultry.\\"  Aren't these the same things?  Long, lingeringly?  Seductive, sultry?  And sentences like \\"He found her reticence disconcerting.  Disorienting.\\"  I think they mean the same thing.  Her sentences were much too choppy, didn't flow together at all. \\"He looked.  Nodded.\\"  It's a pretty drastic change to go from \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\" to On A Wild Night.  And what's with all the corny names?  Vane, Demon, Patience?  Sorry, but I couldn't give this one more than 2 stars and I'm not sure why I gave it that.	2002-09-18

I have to disagree with the reviewers that said this was a disappointment.  This story was unique in that Penelope wasn't a raving beauty, she was a spinster and had never been courted by a man before Colin came along.  And Colin hadn't been very impressed with her years back.  He was the catch of the ton and considering her circumstances, he shouldn't have given her a second glance.  But he did.  And that's what makes it such a beautiful love story.  Everything he does and says to her will make you fall in love with him.  He was the perfect hero for her and their story was one of my favorites.  I've read every Julia Quinn book and they were all good.  This one, however, is one of my favorites.  But don't start it unless you have lots of time because you won't want to put it down.	2002-08-20

The story started out wonderful, with Rafael coming to her rescue and he was so caring toward her, but as the book progressed, I was a bit turned off by the way he handled her, their conversations.  I think he was much too full of himself and the way he spoke had me thinking he was somewhat of a nerd.  I thought the book focused too much on her injury, in fact, that was what most of the book was about.  The brother did inexcusable things to Victoria and to her and Rafael and Rafael didn't deal with it hardly at all.  I expected much more from such an acclaimed author.  But, I will read another one of her books and see if it is any better.	2002-05-01

I read every single page until I reached 350 and then I read the last five pages to see if what I assumed from the very beginning were true, and I was right.  I knew from the beginning that Melina was the one murdered because Brown referred to her as &quot;she&quot; through most of the book.  Only when I got to the middle did she start to write &quot;Melina&quot;.  It was silly that Gillian drove to Melina's house to spend the night.  Hart was not much of a character.  I can't comment on the entire book because I was so bored with it, I didn't finish it.  And usually I will force myself to finish it whether I want to or not, but this one was taking way too long to get to the end.  I was bored from the beginning.  However, I won't give up on Brown.  She is a fantastic author and many of her books are wonderful.  Many of them I can't put down.  However, compared to her other work, this book was probably written in the space of a few days.  Not very well thought out.	2002-02-17

I'm not even finished with it yet, but almost, and I can't imagine that she's going to redeem herself in the last quarter of the book.  I believe it could have been a good book, if she would have written it in usual Sandra Brown style.  I had just finished reading The Alibi (for the 2nd time) and The Witness, so maybe I was expecting more from this book than what I got. Leaving the suspense part out of the Alibi and Witness, I still thought they were better love stories.   I couldn't connect with either Ria or Taylor and usually I'm drawn in in the first few pages of her books. Personally, I'm not quite sure what Ria saw in Taylor and I'm no prude either, but the sex was a little too much.  She could have written it better, I think.  And I'm not slamming her, because she's a great author, but if her name wasn't splashed across the front of this book, I'd never guessed that she wrote it.  It was too trivial for her.  However, the Alibi is a wonderful book, along with The Witness, Breath of Scandal.  Fat Tuesday and Mirror Image are also great reads.	2002-01-24

It moved much too slowly and I found myself wondering if it would ever end.  I wasn't impressed with Cassidy at all for a couple reasons.  He chased her around all the time asking questions when that should have been the detectives job.  Claire was never questioned by the cops.  And I didn't care for the way he &quot;wooed&quot; her into bed.  Kind of a turnoff.  Claire was on my nerves because she kept lying time and again and with all the evidence they had against her, she should have been arrested at the beginning of the book.  Everytime they turned up more evidence, it was never enough according to the Asst. D.A.  The killer turned out to be a disappointment too because he/she (I will try not to give it away) had no motive, no opportunity, no nothing until the last three pages of the entire book.  There's all kinds of suspects throughout the book and it turns out to be someone who had no reason at all, or so you were lead to believe.  I think the author would have done better including this person as a likely suspect along with everyone else in the book.  I'm glad I'm finally done with it.	2002-01-13

However, I did have two problems with it.  Number one, Diana Foster didn't have one flaw and everything she did and said was perfect.  Everyone has flaws.  And then I waited and waited for them to meet again and it wasn't till half way through the book that they actually met and married.  There wasn't much attention focused on the two of them because of Cole's problems.  I'm not sure if I skipped over pages, but I missed where they actually fell in love with each other.  All of a sudden, turn the page and they were madly in love.  It was an entertaining read and Cole is a wonderful hero, but I would have liked to see more about their romance.	2002-01-11

They were both historical romances.  Perfect has been on my shelf for a year now and for lack of anything else to read, I decided to give it a try. I hesitated buying it because I didn't care for her historical romances, but this was a contemporary and I was intrigued that she was going to portray her hero as an escaped convict.  Well the entire book was &quot;perfect&quot; and I couldn't put it down.  I stayed up half the night reading it because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  This book had me literally crying and laughing.  It has to be one of the best contemporary romances that I have ever read.  Zack was the perfect hero, sophiscated, a man of the world and Julie was the perfect heroine for him.  I hated to see it end.  Since I finished the book, I can't wait to get my hands on another one and look forward to reading all her contemporaries.  I will definitely be buying more, starting with Paradise since that is Matt and Meredith's story.  If they are as good as this one was, I will be spending many sleepless nights!	2001-12-20

A wonderful finale to a great series of books.  Arthur and Kerry's love story was so beautiful!  It was funny and entertaining how they met and spent days trying to get back to her home.

And I'm actually kind of bummed that it's over.  I waited and waited for this book to come out and it's been fun seeing the characters reappear in each book, including Alex and Lauren of Wicked Angel.  If you like historical romance, you really won't want to miss any of London's books.

This entire book could have been written on 200 pages instead of the 425 it was written on.  Page after page was all about Junior loved Celina and Celina loved Reede and on and on and on...I thought Alex was a little too full of herself and I can't see how Reede liked her the way he did when she kept accusing him of murdering her mother, but she trusted him enough to put herself alone with him time and time again.  It wasn't realistic and I thought he was just a bit too old for her.  I did finish the book, but got to where I would skip over all the conversations about Junior loving Celina and Celina loving Reede.  It was just the same thing over and over again.  And I knew who the killer was from the beginning.  I think a good Sandra Brown book is either Mirror Image, The Alibi or Breath of Scandal, all of which were very good.	2001-04-27

I don't usually read Harlequin's but it looked entertaining according to the back cover, so I bought it.  The back cover reads, &quot;Now, with the stunning widow installed at his town house, even the Matchmaking Mamas of the ton were doubting that the Earl of Dare would ever recover his good name...&quot;  Not one matchmaking mama was ever mentioned, the story didn't even deal with the ton's reaction to her living with him, and it seemed that noone even knew she was there because the story had very few characters.  The one time the Earl of Dare went to a social event the chapter ended with him leaving for the party and the next chapter had him coming home.  It would have been a much more exciting story had the earl actually socialized and he spoke to more people than Ned and Bonnet.  Elizabeth never left the house and the whole story took place at either his house or Bonnets. Another thing that bugged me about this book, was just about everytime the earl spoke, he spoke &quot;softly&quot;.  Then &quot;more softly&quot;.  I don't think the man raised his voice once. And finally, the story talked of how Bonnet sent Elizabeth to Dare's house to spy on him, when what really happened is Dare is the one who wanted her at his house and insisted she be used for a wager.  And Dare avenging his friend's death was hardly dealt with.  It was kind of ridiculous how he kept showing up places and killing people and I'm not real sure why, unless a few pages were missing from my book.  But I'm giving this book a 3 star for the author's effort and for Dare's sense of humor, which I enjoyed in the beginning of the story.  I think, though, it could have been written better.	2001-03-06

So, I was really excited when I saw another Sandra Brown book on my bookcase that I hadn't read yet.  I liked the first paragraph.  After that, it went downhill fast.  It seemed like she pumped this book out way too fast.  It was too simple.  The dialogue, the characters, everything was a flop.  I had myself believing that I could have done a better job writing this than her.  To go from reading one like the Alibi to Send No Flowers, I just couldn't believe they were written by the same person.  Sorry, I couldn't even finish it.

I really didn't think I would enjoy it but I loved it! It had murder, suspense and romance.  Although I found it hard to believe that Hammond could fall in love with Alex in less than a week, it was still a good book.  I couldn't put it down until I got to the end and found out who the murderer was. It wasn't until the last 20 pages that I started to suspect it might be who it ended up being.  Very well written.  I love how Sandra Brown makes her characters so witty.  I got a kick out of Davee.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys murder and romance reading.	2001-02-24

It had me guessing all the way to the end how Jade would get revenge and she was very clever about how she went about it. I never would have guessed.  And Dillon was the perfect hero. Even though I can guess how the story went on after the book ended, I would have liked to see an epilogue with where everyone ended up, including Neal and her mother. I read this book late into the night, fell asleep reading it and woke up early in the morning just so I could finish it uninterrupted before my family woke up.  I just bought 4 more of her books and I'm sure they'll be as good as the rest.	2001-02-20

This is the first book I have read by Karen Ranney and was very pleasantly surprised.  It was a little different than a lot of historical romances where the hero and the heroine don't get a long for 3/4 of the book. Michael liked Margaret from the very beginning and treated her with such tenderness, as she did him.  I loved the scene with the blue ribbon!  I also enjoyed their conversations where they just got to know each other and what the other thought about things and what they liked. They were so interested in each other and it was a very enjoyable read.  I have since been on Amazon looking for some of her other books to read.  I will add her to my list of favorite authors like Julia London and Julia Quinn and watch for her new releases also.  Read the book.  You won't be disappointed.	2000-11-20

It was a little different in that the heroine was not perfect but it made the love story between Heather and Damien all the more enjoyable.  He didn't care that she walked with a limp and I loved the scene where he waits on the dance floor and puts his hand out to her.  I enjoy Samanatha James' books anyway.  I loved Just One Kiss and One Moonlit Night.  She never disappoints me.  I only have to see her name on the cover and will buy the book without having to read the excerpt inside the cover to see if it's something I would be intersted in.  Read the book.  You won't be disappointed.  It is a beautiful love story.	2000-11-20

I just finished reading this book and I couldn't put it down!  I really didn't think that The Devil's Love or Wicked Angel could be bested, but I believe they have.  I absolutely loved The Devil's Love, but The Ruthless Charmer was even better.  You will fall in love with Julian Dane.  His love for Claudia brought tears to my eyes and I loved the storyline involving him and Sophie, his sister, as well.  This books beats anything I have read! I cannot imagine how Julia London will top this, but I thought that when I read The Devil's Love and along came the Ruthless Charmer.  I can't wait to read Arthur's story.  Please Hurry Julia!	2000-11-04

Olivia grated on my nerves alittle bit, but I loved their  romance.  I didn't guess who the killer was and actually had 3 other people  above the actual killer.  It was a great read and I couldn't wait to get to  the end to see who it was.  This is only my 3rd Nora Roberts book, but I  have ordered many more and can't wait to read them.	2000-08-04

It was not a bad story, although I would have liked to hear more about Noah and Sloan's romance.  I will have to say that I liked this better than Whitney, My Love and Almost  Heaven.  I am considering reading the book now, to maybe catch some of the  things that were taken out for audiobook.  I hope I'm not disappointed,  like I was with her other two books.	2000-03-29
US	50950924	R3VIQU0MXFA6NM	0671737643	869998580	Whitney, My Love	Books	1	8	12	N	N	Definitely not a page turner	I read my first McNaught book, Almost Heaven, a few months ago. It was okay.  Not terribly exciting, but a 3 star.  So I bought another.  Whitney, my Love was supposed to be an excellent book, great love story.  Well, I have to agree with &quot;unearthly calm&quot; who reviewed this book.  This  book could hardly hold my attention, but I kept reading, hoping it would  get better.  It didn't.  The duke was a pompous....jerk.  First, he put her  over his knee and spanked her?  I couldn't believe it! Then later, he  ripped the clothes from her and raped her?  Where is the romance in  spanking the heroine because she was bad then later raping her in a fury?  THEN, he sends her a check and says more or less, have a nice life?  Her  problem is, after all this abuse, she still actually loves him and begged  him to take her back?  Truthfully, after the spanking, I was hoping she'd  hightail it to Paris and hook up with DuVille.  But she married him and he  redeemed himself a tiny bit, till he squashed the baby gown.  How  disappointing.  McNaught also goes into way too much detail about  everything to where it is incredibly boring.  I like a light, fun, fast  paced read, like Julia Quinn or a real romantic story like Julia London  writes, where when you reach the end, you wish it wouldn't end, unlike this  one, where you're halfway through, wishing it WOULD end.	2000-03-24

I loved this book because it was a little different than all the historical romance books I've read.  Sara was older than the duke, which was a new twist that I liked and she was widowed, which made the love  scenes unlike the rest that I've read where the heroine is a virgin.  I  also thought Trevor was a gentle, loving person, instead of the rakish  rogue books usually portray. It was a great read!  I couldn't put it down.	2000-03-17

Don't start this book unless you have a lot of time to spare because once you start, you won't be able to put it down.  As with How to Marry a Marquis, To Catch an Heiress and The Duke and I, this was a wonderful book.  I love the way Julia Quinn works humor into her love stories.  I loved  Robert.  Victoria did play a little too hard to get, but it was a great  read anyway.  I just ordered Brighter Than the Sun from Amazon and can't  wait to get my hands on that one either.  And her new book will be out in  October.  I'm sure it will be just as enjoyable as the rest!	2000-03-12

I didn't connect with either characters in the book and had to force myself to finish it.  I have read a few other Cathy Maxwell books and found them enjoyable, but this one was a  disappointment.  I thought Devon was a flop for a hero and Leah wasn't much  better.	2000-03-02

I couldn't put it down!  I read Wicked Angel first and that was just as good.  I can't decide which one I liked best but I can't  wait to read another one from Julia London.  Please don't make us wait  long!!!	1999-10-14

I was the exact opposite.  I didn't care for the movie but loved the book.  In the movie, I wasn't convinced  they were in love. The book was much deeper.  I thought the movie portrayed  him as a bitter person and I didn't see that in the book.  I couldn't wait  to see the movie either but when I finally got to see it, I was  disappointed.  The book was much, much better. However, they both ended  sadly and I was disappointed about that. I like a book to end leaving me  feel good, not sad.	1999-09-15

I loved the romance between James and Elizabeth and cried when I read Lady Danbury's letter at the end. The entire book was witty and entertaining.  I loved the  humor and James love for Elizabeth.  I loved To Catch an Heiress, and I  might add, it was fun to see Blake and Caroline back in this book, but I  liked To Marry a Marquis just a bit better.  I've ordered Everything and  the Moon from Amazon and can't wait to read that!  Good work Julia!	1999-09-14
US	50950924	R3O0N4ZCHULCP	0451408942	781766682	Into the Wild Wind	Books	2	1	5	N	N	A boring read	I was not impressed with this story.  Hannah and James didn't have one meaningful conversation on the 98 day trip on Windfire, much less any conversation.  He wasn't even nice to her and all they did was bicker at  each other.  Then, I turn the page and he's 'deeply' in love with her!  He  doesn't even know her and he's begging her to marry him, running down a  street shouting he loves her!  And Hannah is determined to marry a man who  deserted her, who she doesn't even love.  She loves James too, even though  she doesn't know him any better than he knows her.  Sorry, but this book  was a total disappointment to me.  I had to force myself to finish it.	1999-09-12

It's one of those books I read, then put on the shelf and when I want an excellent book to read, I read it again.  There's never any bitterness between the hero and heroine  in this book, which is a nice change from the usual bickering throughout a  book.  They like each other from the beginning to end in this book!	1999-09-10

I could hardly put it down and when I finished it, I was disappointed it was over!  I loved the love story between Alex &amp; Lauren  and I loved the humor.  I can't wait to read A Devil's Love! Keep writing  Julia!  It was an excellent book!	1999-09-10
