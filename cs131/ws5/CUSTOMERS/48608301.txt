Most fantasy books are about young teenagers this makes these novels is many ways coming of age novels.  By making the characters in his novel adults (Only one major character is under twenty) Bakker adds maturity to his world.  This novel is placed in a world and you can feel the weight of the history, both of the world and of the characters in their actions.   <br /> <br />      This is not a feel good swashbuckleing novel.  This world is painfull, bigotry, hatreds and supersitions are presented as part of the socities and are resented and accepted by the characters in stride, this is their world and this is what they expect.  This isn't a novel that will have some 110 pound girl pick up a sword and armor and miraculosly be able to best some 200 pound knight who is three times as strong and been trianing with wepons full time for 15 years.  The females characters have to fight on their own terms, sex and desire are a weapon in this book and not wielded exculsively by the women.  Women are not allowed to join the sorceres schools, not for any real reason, just because everyone is sexist.   <br />        <br />        The real streagth of this novel is characteraztion.  I read this novel for a second time and was suprized at both how little and how much happened.  The first 200 pages go quite slow, but are very effective in how they delvop the characters.  Drusas and Esmenet are both flawed in very deep ways, but command respect and become more compelling as the novel progresses.  The central character is Kellus who is facinating as being something greater than a normal human.  A monk who has superhuman reflexes, the intelect of genuis, and unnatural self control.  But what really makes him facinating is his complete attention to his mission and lack of true emotion.  It takes a daring author to make a main character distictly unlikable, but when they make it work it produces great characters and great insight into thier world.	2005-04-05

But while memory, sorrow and thorn is not my favorite fatasy series, those stories had an urgency to them that is shockingly lacking here.  The story is slow moving, not a whole lot happens and the world is left rather underdevoped for having finished a more than 500 page novel.  By the end of the novel I was skipping pages(somthing I nearly never do) to see if somthing more interesting happens at the next POV change.  Simply put this novel is only for the most bored fantasy fan, who is unwilling to risk buying some more unknown author of the genre.	2005-03-30

Everything that happens is ridiculous, and the characters respond with enough humor to show that they know whats going on too.   <br />     The book is a set of three chorologicly sequenced storys with a buch of characters named Smith.  Travel in a caravan and they start a hotel, with some interesting results.   <br />    The problem with this book is the fact that Baker adds in a environmental theme to the book that just doesn't work.  Some parts of the anology are played obvouisly and way to often.  But my bigger problem is that I just don't think that it was well made.  For a satirical book to have impact on a seroius issue, it has to be aimed very accurately.  Who are the greenie's in real life, and who are the children of the sun?  Do techicialy minded people really breed like rabbits and are sexuly premucious?  The anology looks okay from a distance but the details and sterotypes in the book simply don't hit home.  If poeple want to see a good evormental analogy they should read Peter F. Hamilton, or L.E. Mossidett's science fiction.   <br />          What makes this more tragic is the fact that this anology drags down the last third of an otherwise very good book.  I still recomend this book as a good read for a road trip, but its not must read fantasy.	2004-09-05

But the real theme of this book is the damage that people do to themselves and those around them because of their bitter reactions to lifes unfair treatments.   <br />    The main character, is a man who grows up as one of the social elite on a newly colonized world.  A bitter fight with his father leads to his leaving his home and the girl that he loves in pursuit of his childhood fantasy of becomeing a spaceship pilot.  Instead he becomes a soldier in an army that conducts what is basicly legal piracy.   <br />       What makes this book great is the way that Hamilton describes the war and the resistance from several view points.  All war are colficts of diffent sides, he does not reduce his world to the virtuous heroes, and the evil invaders.  Each side is flawed, and both sides are wrong. Both sides in this confict can only lose by reducing to violence, but small groups can inflame the situation, and pride and anger take over. This book was written before the Iraqi invasion, but anyone who wants to know why the fighting there continues, and will continue at some level until all of the forign forces leave should read this book. <br />     The ending is odd and full of parodoxes, but the book earns its sentimental ending, because this is a book about a man finding what he really wanted in life is what he left behind.  The book acts as a kind of adult and very male parable about how peoples most precious dreams and ideals can be based on somewhat faulty information.	2004-08-23

Modesitt is not only not afriad, but any of his science fiction books could serve as a final paper in a philosopy 101 class.  Kind of like an action book for an acedmic, the plot of this book is really just meant to set up the main character's discussions with himself and other people around him.  <BR>       I liked this book for the fact that was kind of a comeing of age story.  I brought up issues such as honesty, and had some very good comentary about a man who is forced to come and live a socity that is different, and technoligly more advanced than his own.  <BR>       The problem with the book is that the philosophy and the main character quickly becomes very self centered and arrogant.  Many parts of this book brought me back to my high school days, where I would have arguments with friends that were more about being clever that being right.  By the end of the book the character has a very contrived philosophical conversion that is a the best example of intelectual flatulence that I had seen written outside of a university.	2003-09-29

It is dissappointing because at many points I felt that Famer was onto something really special.  The idea of having every human for ten thousand years put onto a planet together creates an infinite number of possible story lines.  Farmer even sets up some very interesting plot lines with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, but then fails to treat them in any real intellegent or significant way.  It's nice to see Burton meet Goering, I wanted to see into Goering character or into the character of a different society that would use his talents as Germany did.  This is not done however, and is what keep this book from being any better than mediocre.  The end result is like talking to someone who keeps asking, \\"What if\\",  but lacks either the words or the imagination to take it any further.	2003-01-29

Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is a compentent and often compelling novel with a few memorable characters, and well developed world.  <BR>      The main problem with this book is that the world that Williams creates stoped developing and coming up with new suprises after the first book.  To key to keeping a good fantasy series going is much the same a planning a good vacation.  The fun is not so much in what you do, but in living and seeing the different lifestyles in the cities you visit.  The culture of the characters was suprisingly monotone, and to make it worse the mythology behind the story was weak.  Sorry, but the storm king couldn't make it anywhere near my fireside storytelling list.    <BR>     I give this series three stars because of the good characters and the often compelling trials that they are put through.  But ultimately the book draged too much for me to give it any better.	2002-11-17

A science fiction masterpiece that is written from a feminist viewpoint.  <br />    The book is simply about a society that is created after a devisating war.  This society is based almost completely on making sure that no such war could ever occur again.  The society is divided into women's country, were the social and economic work is done, and the garrisons were the men who refuse to live under the women live to fight the men in the sorounding towns.  <br />    While books of this type are often uncomfortable, and heavly biased, Tepper is very fair in how she protrays the people in her society.  The farther along the book goes, and as the more complex relationships in the colony are revealed, the system starts to make more sense.  The answers that are given are very disturbing, but in my view fair to all who live under them.  This is the kind of book that should be read to challenge ideas and perceptions about the world.  I don't particulary agree with the answer that women's country come up with, but I aprecited the chance to hear it.	2002-08-29

Dr. Loewen starts this book by making a very valid and important point about how history is taught to children, and then proceeds to viloates every single point he complains about in his own view of history. His point about how American history is taught as a hail to the flag, cheer for all of these all american heroes so we won't have to think, is a very valid point.  My own school history education through about the eighth grade mirrors this problem.  Loewen argues for teaching history as a series of unproven arguments, and as a group of ongoing debates.  This would be a change that I would herald, and I would love this book if that were indeed what he did.  Unfortunatly he is every bit as bad if not worse than the other authors that he is complaining about.  <BR>     Instead of overly praising U.S. heroes and ignoring their faults, Loewen does the same thing for the other side of the equation, making oppressing Native Americans and blacks the purpose behind every single action in U.S. history.  While he is correct that especally the Native Americans are not given their full credit for their influence in the shaping of America, that fact does not excuse Loewens terrible use of history to rectify that.  After the third chapter of the book, Loewen forgets to use such things as logic, and cause and effect to make his arguements.  He makes claims with no real evidence to back him up.  I would be facinated to find out how the Native American cultures directly led to Rousseau, Locke, and most of the other major englienment philosophers to write their best works.  Such an argument effectivly made could propalby win him at least a pulizer.  It seems that Dr. Loewen is immune to such basic burden of proof for his arguments.  <BR>    He has come across to me in this book as one of many left wing history professors that saturate universities with a lot of hot air but very little substance.  This is a book that needs to be written, but by a serious historian not this clown	2002-08-22

This novel shows the weakness that a new writer brings to a novel.  The story is too plot driven, the villians have weak motivation, and the use of point of view was simply baffeling.  There were times when I completely lost track of who the point of veiw was following.  This novel also shows Jordan's often odd and what I find highly unlikely veiw of how women see the world.  And while I could keep this list going, for all of that he managed to write a fairly compelling story.  His historical backgroud was interesting, if for nothing else but for the southern bias that it takes.<br />        While there are far to many mistakes to call this a great novel, and any of Jordan's wheel of time novels are far better.  This was an entertaining read that can show how much a writer can improve.	2002-06-12

Killers that are superhumans enties that have two bodies controled by the same mind. <br />     This book introduces several interesting characters.  More importanly the book gets the mood and setting right.  The characters move around in style and the story flows well.  This book is really a modern dime novel, with the privet eye replaced by a special ops expert.  <br />    Unfortuneatly as a trilogy this story fails rather badly.  The second and third books do not work nearly as well as the first two.  Only the main two characters are kept through all three books and they simply don't stand up the rigor of another seven hundred pages.

The novel has a child raised by animals theme, combined with a lost heir to the throne coming back home.  The book spends the first two hundred pages finding and bring back &quot;Firekeeper&quot; to civilization, and then settles in to book about political intrigue.  <br />      The first part of this book, and for the most part all of the book that delt with the wolves and introduceing the lost girl to civilazation was very good.  The characters are developed well and the plotline was quite facinating.  <br />      What keeps me from giving this book four or five stars is that while the book has all the ingrediants to be very good it just wasn't put together right.  A book that is about political intrigue needs the characters to be a little more suave and a little more cunning than they are protrayed.  The story was told too much by the characters telling each other their exact plans and ambitions.  A better book would have been more subtle leaving the reader in the dark the same way that the characters are in the dark.  Most of the fun in this type of novel is trying the figure out what the adversaries are going to do and what the heroes will do to stop it.	2001-12-17

This is the first Harry Turtledove book that I managed to finish.  Once I got into the flow of the story the book reads very well.  Turtledove shows remarkable ability to write a complex story without losing the reader.  <br />     The book follows the exploits of about 15 to 20 (I lost count at about seven) mostly unconnected characters during the beginning of a fatasy war based on WWII.  The book spends the first hundred pages or so introducing characters, and then it turns up the pace, this story may many things but it is never dull.<br />      The glaring problem with this very entertaining book is that it is missing a purpose for its existance.  The book doesn't have anything important or insightfull to say about WWII or its characters for that manner.  What is the point of writing an alternate history novel if not to try to put at least some insight into the history.  As it is the book just plagerises from history books to create a storyline for the author to sell.

This is a great book for anyone who is interested in this topic.  My only problem with the book is that its scope could have been a little wider, and the history placed more in context.

This novel does a very good job in filling in the rest of the universe outside of arrakis.  It takes the story to the capital to calidan and to geti prime.  It makes up new world of Ix and some new neat villians.  The sheer imagination of the world carries this story a consiterable distance.  The story also starts well setting up a good cast of characters in some interesting siutations.<br />     Now the bad.  This novel loses it focus and sense of intellegence halfway in.  The plotting that makes up most of the last half of the book just didn't feel that clever.  I didn't read this book and feel immersed in complex political games, a character that was almost omnipitant in one sceane is rather weak in the next.  The story line that is very good the first half of the book doesn't carry over to the second half.<br />        And of course the ugly.  What really keeps this book from being a four or five star book, is its inconsistant writing.  I could tell that this book was written by two authors, and that is not a compliment.  Some parts are written well, but then the writing deteriorates.  The problem isn't with the prose, but just the style of writing.  The characters and the narrorators feel a need to say everything they are feeling.  A good author protrays feelings through the characters actions and more subtle characteristics.  This got really bad about two-thirds of the way through the book.  Sorry but this is amatuer type work that takes an otherwise very good book and makes it simply mediocre.	2001-10-22

This novel has the feel of one of Stephen Kings lighter novels, such as &quot;insomnia&quot;.

The novel tells a story about a man running from a troubled past, who is renovating an old abadoned mansion in South Carolina.  The rest of the story is one badly remade clique after another.  The gost of the house has to come to terms with its death, an enemy must be brought to the house to bring justice.  <br />     The real surprise here is how badly Card wrote these characters.  The main character is explained like a character descrption on a play, all modivation, but without the actor to make it real.  This work has only the shell of Cards' normal character and is strangly deviod of his normal philisophical ideas.  This work feels like it was thrown out to please an editor.

The first novel in this series swept me away with a captivating world of what might have been.  This novel returns to that world and proceeds to get really lost.  This story is a very heavy handed look at the abuse that immigrants gave to the native americans.  While events very much like the events in this book actually happened, and often in ways just as cold if not colder than what this book showed, this does not excuse the way that these events are shown.  Not that this book is really bad, it just doesn't have any urgency to it.  This book reminded me of the movie &quot;The Green mile&quot;, in that it had the same setimentalism that to me seemed contrived.  There are plenty of stories to be told on this subject, but this one just had to urgency and oddly for Card a weak sense of character.  <br />     Card as always has very good characters, but many of their actions seemed forced.  Many of the characters where given to the readers as reluctant fighters, but I just wasn't convinced.

The conclusion to this series or as William's himself called it a 4000 page book in four instalments was very good.  It is always a truly impressive feat when an author can write a long sprawling novel with dozens of characters and sub-plots, and manage to make them tie up neatly in the end.  In the end of this novel all of the characters are taken care of, and the answers are all satisfactory.  <br />       This series managed to create a level of mystery and excitment that is rarely equalled.  Williams was able to combine sci-fi and fatasy worlds seemlessly.  The novel had all of the intelligence and high minded ideas of a science fiction book, and at the same time build the deep characters and mystery of a fantasy novel.  <br />     While this is an incredible acheivement, their are a couple of problems with this book that in my opinion kept it from being a truly great book.  First, I could help but think that this series would have been better if he could have found a way to cut 500 pages from the story.  I love long series of books and can read them quite quickly, but their were times when this book felt long.  The twentith time that one of the groups runs through a hostile simulation barely escaping with their lives just got to be repeditive.  Second, the sense of mystery and the excitment of how the novel redefined the world was not present in the last two books.  This sense of mystery and excitment that made the first book so great, simply did not reappear.  This story started out new and compelling, but ended in a very convintional manner.  Even with these problems this is still one of the top books published in either sci-fi or fatasy in the last five years.	2001-04-27

Reading other reviews here, I was suprised at how negative many of the reviews are.  I can relate to the fact that many of these are students that have been forced to read this book through no fault of their own.  But this book is simply of the best physological profiles of a soldier in combat ever written.  The fact that it is still read one hundred years after its intial publishing shows how excellent the writing is.             The book follows the story of one man and his battles with his own fear in the face of enemy fire.  The story is not really clear or defined, it is not meant to be.  The story is at its heart about the confusion and fear on the battlefield, and how it tests a soldiers convitions, and personal integrity.  The main character refers to most of the other characters in the novel using descptive names such as tall soldier, or the officer.  This makes since, the main character is often wadering through a large army, and would not know the names of anyone but a few close compians in his own regiment.  <br />     This is one of the only novels to ever truly come close to decribing the emotions that drive soldiers of victory or defeat on a battlefield.  Like many great novels it is short, but contains more than most books twice its leangth.  This book is a must read for anyone at all interested in history.	2001-04-19

Crichton has always frustraded me, writing 4/5 of a brilliant book, and then ending them with some miraculous event that makes the problem take care of itself.  This book has the same problem as all of his other ones having the most unsatisfactory ending to a book that I can remember. <br />    What made me dislike this book is that it fails at what really makes his other novels work.  Crichton's novels captivate the reader with easily understandable explainations and extrapalations of new high technology.  While there are the usuall neat gadgets that he describes, this time he just didn't pick out anything that was really facinating.  <br />    This novel is an attempts to be a Stephen King type action thriller, but comes up badly lacking when compared to better work of that genre.  Stories such as these, are all about the characters and what they find out about themselves.  All of the characters in this novel are so one-dimisional that the book becomes a second rate slasher book.  <br />     THe only real use for this book is as a useless time killer.	2001-04-09

The book opens spectacularly and keeps hitting you with a brilliantly protrayed world and facenating characters.  This is the best sci-fi fatasy blend that I have ever read.  Williams weaves in and out of sub-plots, building up suspence with remakable effectiveness(I bought the sequal the day I finshed it).  <br />     Children are collasing into unexplianable comas after trips on the net.  People are finding mysterious keys, and visions of a golden city.  A dreaded serial killer is attacking a secret society, to protect his employers.  All these events lead to the golden city where some answers are held.  This story is a fun ride through a world that is a remarakable feat of imagination.  Anyone can think up of a story like this, but it takes real talent to make it work.  <br />     This book is really the first part of four, of what is one book.  Williams comments on this, saying he wrote the outline as just one story, but he obviously cannot publish one 3,000 + page book.	2001-04-09

Four the first five hundred pages or so of this book this overworked satire works really well.  The anti-hero that Hubbard creates puts a good laugh at the problems and evils of beuracracies.  The concept is great, an alein invasion that exists to save the earth from humans so they could use it as a base in the future.  However, as the book progresses I found the satire to get more and more tedious.  If book had been kept to about three or four hundred pages I would easily call this one of the great sci-fi stories.  <br />      Hubbard has created his kind of philosophy and used it to start the church of scientology.  It feels to me as if he is using this book to press these ideas just a little to hard.  He presses his points fabracating situations and ideas that I just didn't relate to, or just didn't agree with.  Philosophy is an art that demands that people must be able to explain itself so that people can follow the chain of thought and make the same conclusions.  Hubbard does not do this very well.  At some point I stopped seeing the villain as a character I could relate to, and the story then becomes ridiculous.  <br />     Overall this book was decent, but as for reading nine more books of the same kind of satire.  Thanks but no more please.	2001-04-02

Much of this book is spent decribing Hitler's rise to power, terms of the 1918 treaty, and the political games that were played out in the 1930's giving Germany it's new empire.  This is important, because it had such a large effect on how Germany proceeded for the rest of the war.  The book then goes into the development of tank warfare, how the tatic evolved from the shock troops at the end of WWI, how Germany's leaders had found new better ways to fight, and why the allies were still so backward in their thinking.  <br />    Dieghton points out that in May 1940 the only real difference between the German and allied armies was their leadership and tatics.  Deighton gives a clear and easy to understand analysis tank warfare, as well as giving very good backgroung into the sorounding political and social situations that many WWII history books lack.	2001-03-27

This book is the most captivating tragedy I have ever read simply because it is real.  This is the kind of book that only could have been made in this situation.  A talented writer faces a tragedy in a subject in which is an expert himself.  The book hits the reader with a captivating force simply because it is written with the authors very real attempt to come to terms with why this tragedy happened.  A lot of this book is spent with the author trying to figure out why he and the other climbers spend so much time and effort, sacrificing their body in a sucicidal attempt to reach a rather hollow goal.  In 1996 144 people had died climbing Everest for 640 times that it had been succesfully acomplished.

This novel is hard to rate because some parts are so very good, and some other parts are so uninspired.  This tale of sleeping buety in the Urkraine has its moments, but in the end I found it failed to really deliver.  I felt that Card really wanted to tell a story with these characters, but just couldn't quite find one that fit right.  These characters are too deep and to involved for any of them to really be in a fairy tale.  Card tries to make the world realistic while still keeping a fairy tale plot where everything will be okay if you believe hard enough.  All of the momentum that is developed in the beginning of the novel is lost tring to set up series of events that are either not believable or not true to the tone of the book.  What results is the last three or four chapters felt like an uninspired fatasy book that knows its telling a story thats been told before, and told better.<br />      This isn't to say the book doesn't have redeming qualities.  The first half of the book is simply excellent, Card develops a character in Ivan that lives up to his talent as an author.  The rest of the book has its flashes of being something greater, but keeps being draged down by a plot that just doesn't quite ring true.	2001-03-18

This fantasy set in an alternate American history, is yet another adsobing character book from Card.  The story is about a young boy with special magical powers, who is constantly under attack from an unseen enemy, and always protected by an unseen gaurdian.  While the story is written as a loose allegory on the life of Josheph Smith (founder of the Mormon church), this does nothing to take away from the magic of the story telling, or make the ideas less relavent to people such as myself who know little or nothing about him.  <br />        This book has Card doing what he does best.  Having very real and adsobing characters, act out on real and mostly unseen enemies.  Most of the action in this book takes place within the minds and speech of the characters.  The battles that take place are subtle and magical, more battles of will than battles of physical prowess.  <br />     Rarely have I been more caught up in story, or with it's unnervingly real characters than I was with this book.  My only concern with this series is that I am not sure where it is going.  This series has a lot of promise, and I hope that the rest of this series lives up to this book.	2001-03-15

This is a well written war book, that is very much in line with most of the 70's science fiction that I have read.  It is full of odd sex themes, and non idealized violence.  The book focuses around a drafted soldier named Mandella.  He fights both the enemy and time over three campains.  Each time he goes on a campain he loses more and more time relative to where he grew up.  Each time he comes home, the world has moved on agian.  <br />     This book is really about the displacement that soldiers feel when they come home to a place that has changed and moved on since they left. And the war itself is a not well hidden metafor for the Vietnam war.  The problem that I had with this book is that I am not nearly old enough to remeber Veitnam, or it's imediate side effects.  This book does not quite have the power to be a real classic.  It is a very good short action novel, it just doesn't ever quite involve the reader enough to be considered one of the great sci-fi novels.	2001-03-14

This book is a five hundred page social commentary, decribing a utopian communist commune.  The main character is a physist who is out to resolve conflicts withing the communes planet and it's sister plant.  A Earthlike planet with a political situation, not unlike the one we have now.<br />  The reason I &quot;disliked&quot; the book is the political and social commentary that is at the center of this book just did not sit with me at all.  Le Guin just didn't convince me that this society had fixed the issues within communism and anarcy that make them unstable, and have led to some of the most promising nations in the last hundrend years and driven them into the ground.  It would be nice if people could live the way she suggests, but the book does not give any real answers.  A famous econimist recently stated in his book that all econimic systems are inherantly unstable, and that strong regalotory systems are needed to stop periodic crashes and times of econimic chaos.  This hurts this book because this is a political book that is about the politics of a perfect world, and validity of the political system is the center of the story.<br />  That being said, this is a brilliant piece of writting.  As much as I disliked the politics of this book, the story is very well told, with engaging characters, and a well depicted world.  I find it nice to sometimes read books about ideas I disagree with, it makes me re-evaluate my point of view, either changing my ideas or making my beliefs stronger.<br />  This book did not change my political ideas at all, but it at least gave a good account of itself.  And that makes it well worth reading, no matter how distastefull the book feels.	2001-03-04

Feist is an author that manages to write readable books simply though sheer pleasantness.  This characters in this series are striat out of a seventh heven episode.  They take everything so seriously, and with such innocence.  While this is not the formula for great literature (I find the number of five star ratings puzzling), it has a certian appeal.  The world is well drawn out, especally for people who have read some of his earlier series (I haven't).  <br />     This story focuses around two... from a small town named Erik and Roo.  They commit a crime and are forced to flee from their homes, which eventully leads them to become soldiers, set to fight a new threat to the world.  <br />     As I was alluding to before, how cute.  These two characters will run around, fight many battles and meet a lot of people all of the while never quite losing their charming innocence.  This series is not in the same league as Jordan, Hobb, or Martin, but that doesn't stop it from being fun.	2001-02-28

This series of novels is simply the most comforable and enjoyable reading that I have ever read.  This novel deals with broad ideas of good and evil that the book takes seriously enough that the reader doesn't have to do the same.  My five star rating of this book is meant to relative to what the book attempt to create.  This novel is basicly a re-write of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; by Tolken.  The basic story doesn't have an original direction.  This has none of G.R. Martins bold plot and daring direction, nor does it have Robin Hobbs vision or ideas.  What makes this series so great is the detailed, deep world that Jordan creates.  Their are a dozen contries each with its own politics, culture, and fashions.  This is an easy place for the reader to immerse within, and it is not hard to follow because the reader is introduced to these new people and places at the same time as the characters.  This is not meant to be a place for long philoshopical discussion, the characters know what is right and what is wrong, they just have to do what they feel they need to do.  <br />     Jordan manages to create characters that are truly distintive.  They are all a little sterotyped, but they all show their differences in their more sutle actions.  Many people see this as a fault in the writing, but people act like this all of the time.  It actully helpes me keep the characters strait in the later books, if the character is from Tear, he or she will act like someone from Tear.  The characters in the novel change gradually over the course of events.  This is a rare treat in modern fiction, where the character either start out perfect and stay that way, or they change all at once and always in a perfectly positive way.  <br />     Jordan writes a PG-13 story with consistant sexual undertones (hey his characters are teenagers), and mild violence.  Jordan does not give in to the temptation to have some grusome act of violence every five pages.  He know that his story will have enough of that without having to contrive it out of nowhere.<br />    I consiter this to be the Star Wars of modern fantasy.  Like Star Wars it has a thin but elegant story line, but it is a great show.  Anyone who likes light sci-fi or fanatasy reading, and has some time on their hands should try this series.	2001-02-25

Robin Hobb has a tendancy to write incredible fatasy series, only to cut the ending short.  The conclusion to the farseer trilogy, has the same brilliant prose and captivating magic that makes this a first class series.  I disagree with the idea that these kind of fantasy series should be trimmed down.  It is the depth of the description of the smaller detials of a story that makes the story come to life.  Hobb spends a lot of time bringing the characters to their final destination, but then hurries the ending in a manner that somewhat unsafisfactory.  The conculsion was not bad, she had the respect for her story to aviod the unseemly good ending that kills some lesser authors.  <br />     Overall this is a first class fatasy series that places Hobb as one of the premiere authors in this genre.  She writes stories of a managable leangth, which allows her to try new ideas and new kinds of characters in ways that many authors cannot get away with in their 6,000 page epics.	2001-02-24

The characters in this novel are much like the characters in his other similar novels, and the problems and solutions are not very diffent than what he has come up with in another half dozen of his novels.  <br />     What makes Niven so facinating, is his simple imagination.

The best thing I can say about this series is that I somehow managed to read the first three and a half books.  Goodkind has consiterable potential as a writter, he just needs to start telling stories to tell stories instead of looking for a platform to write about whatever social ideas are bothering him at the time.  Not to say that putting social ideas into books is a bad thing, but a truly good author can do this without the ideas taking over the story(Read Tolken and you will see this done flawlessly).  Goodkind is writing a series with no visable goal.  This series has the potential to turn out like Modesitt's recluse series, a never ending series of independant books that has no real purpose other that to keep the writer busy.  Fortunatly Modessitt has other projects besides reculse that are much better.<br />      This series has some promising characters, but no real character devolopment.  There is no real time spent making the characters grow or change.  The characters run around into events that are just too random, and seem to get out of them without anything of real importance being changed.  The truely interesting part of any story is watching how the characters are changed and learn from the events that they encounter.  This book does not do this in a convincing manner.  <br />     This book is gruesome, with too many torture, and violent sex scenes.  The only explanation for this is that the writer thinks that this will help sell books, (Looking at his sales he is probalbly right) because the plot would go along just fine without 90% of this.<br />     Goodkind needs to start over with another series.  It is truely a shame that such a talented writer is spending so much time writing a series that almost good.  If he could just add a story with some broader scope to his intrest in writing about ideas, he could truly be something.	2001-02-22

It is a novel about a war that speaks to a major social issue.  <br />    The first half of the book sets up a universe at war.  This part of the book goes into large detail, about the defense of a devoloping world, from religous radicals.  The action sequences are for the most part very good, with the execption of a couple of sceanes where the description loses focus and becomes vague.<br />      The second half of the book is about the main characters attempt to find a solution to the war, by acting as an itellegence agent for his race.  <br />    This book is smart, and does a good job devolping the atomoshere that the two societies have twords the war.  More than any other war novel that I have read, this book gives the war experence as a combination of combat, as well as the social aspects of the war that each side faces as consequence of the fighting.  This allows the book to look at the reasons and modivations of both sides of the conflict, and to show how the war itself makes both sides reason for fighting obsolete.  The most interesting part of the book is where one side character points out that one side is fighting for land that they will never need, and the other side is taking so many casualties, that they no longer need the new land.   <br />    WARNING:  This book may offend some deeply religous people due to the way that religon is protrayed in the book.  A church that is a little too like the Mormon church is protrayed in a way that could be taken badly.	2001-02-18

This is one of the best, if not the best autobigoraphy of any major military leader.  This is the most insightfull view of the cival war, after all he was there.  Grant writes in a clear detirmined tone, and is suprisingly modest and fair to all sides.  The vast majority of the book is written about his military career.  He gives one of the best acounts of the Mexican War, and a long and very descriptive account of his Cival War campains.  He talks very little about his years in private life, or his years as president.  He seemed to feel uncomforable out of uniform, and trusted the wrong people too much.  <br />       Very few people come across as well as Grant in their autobiographies.  One of the great military leaders this country has had. As a general, much like Washington. he was only a good but not brilliant tactian.

This often overlooked war was very important in devoloping the people who would decide the fate of the nation ten years later.  The book was rather weak in a couple of areas, and should have been longer.  Not nearly enough attention and detail was put into decribing the statagy that general Scott used in this war.  Wellington personaly praised Scott as one of the best generals of his generation for his Mexican campain.  <br />       The most glaring oversight was how little attention was given to Grant and Longstreet in this book (only one chapter each).  This is puzzling consitering that Grant himself wrote a consiterable amount about his experiances in this war in his memoirs(which are worth reading for people interested in this time period).

This is far from the most compelling book that these two authors have co-written.  But that can not take away from the fact that they have written a solid book.  As a coming of age novel this book is decent enough, with some fairly good ideas thrown into the mix.  The writing is as aways very readable, and the story is paced well.  Niven and Pornell write these sci-fi/fantasy with a comparatively slow paced storyline.  I find this a rather relaxing change of pace from authors who feel a need to contrive odd events that don't fit into their story just because they assume that their readers don't have the attention span to read through a story that doesn't blow somthing up every two minutes.

The novel is about two smugglers who are trying to transport a mysterous ship back to earth aginst the wishes of the galaxies most powerfull race.  Zahn agian shows his talent for writing very entertaining novels within rather thin worlds.

The main character in the novel finds out, quite accidentally, that all that is needed for people to recover from the most terrible tragedies is a sense of direction and leadership.  This book gives one of the most candid views on how people respond to our government, and helps to remind us what kind of effort it has taken to build this country.<br />     In the novel, the main character finds an old postal uniform with some ten year old letters, and finds out that something as simple as someone delivering mail can bring people hope.  He then finds that this helps people remember that they were once part of something greater than themselves.  This book manages to be inspiring without droping down to the level of a cheesy disney movie.    <br />     The only reason this book doens't get five stars from me is that I felt the end cheated in a way that made it lose some its focus.  But this hardly overshadows the brilliant bulk of this book.	2001-02-08

The conclusion to this classic space opera was not all that it could have been.  After setting up what was by far one of the best worlds, and some of the best ideas that I have ever seen in the space opera genre, the ending was rather anti-cliamatic and aimed rather low.  After coming up with a very philosophical approach to death and to the afterlife, I found the way he ended it comparatively weak.              This said, this is still one of the best sci-fi series to come out recently.  The series is built up with some solid characters, and deals well with some very profound implications.  If he had pushed the envelope just a little more, he could have created a truely great series. <br />     The universerse that Hamilton created is very strong if not totally original.  He combines some of the best receint ideas brought up in science fiction(bio-computers and live spaceships, it works better than it sounds), and recreates it with a star wars twist that works suprisingly well.  He goes a little over the top on some of his side storys.  The first book has the main character acting like his auditioning for a Heinlen novel.  But when he sticks to his story he makes the reader forget that this is supposed to be pulp fiction.	2001-01-24
US	48608301	R2GGLDEAO8ULR	0553568736	544858652	A Plague of Angels	Books	4	4	6	N	N	most magical sci-fi I have ever read.	This book is the most successful combination of sci-fi and fatasy elements that I have ever read. Agian Tepper manages to weave a mystical tale that is thought provoking, as well as entertaining. The tale goes from mid-evil archtype towns right out of Rodgers and Hammerstien, to futuristic suburbs with shocking proficiency. While not quite as good as some of her other books, it would be better if the world were either a little more realistic or a little more aligorical, \\"plague of angles\\" holds its own with any of the abstract sci-fi out there. What makes Tepper so good is her ability to write books with several levels of meaning without falling into vague or inaccessable metaphors.	2001-01-19
US	48608301	R1P12ELSFYS58L	0380770962	642834482	Brother to Shadows	Books	4	4	9	N	N	solid and well written.	This book is not in any way original, or very thought provoking for that manner.  But this is bulk sci-fi at its best.  It takes a story that has been written at least a dozen times, and remakes it in a way that is very readable and entertaining.  The main characters are from a tribe of superwarriors who have to fight much stronger and better equipt enemies.  While this is a plot that has been made several times, and by better authors, this books works like most saturday action movies that Hollywood creates.  It's not that thought provoking and you know what is going to happen but it is still good entertainment for a rainy day.	2001-01-15

Orson Scott Card is quickly, writing himself into becoming one of the great sci-fi masters.  He agian proves that he can write a book that combines action, with in this case political ideas in a way that only a few others have managed to do.  Of the authors that I have read most of thier works, only Niven rivals his storytelling, and Only Asmov rivals his scope of ideas.<br />     These novels about bean are more than just another attempt to make money of of the success of Enders game.  Card contiues to delovop new ideas in politics and theology.  This is what real sci-fi is all about.   While the ideas in this book are not quite as well integrated than some of his other books, it still succeded within its scope.	2001-01-10

If thier is any bood that should be required reading for high-schools it is these books.  There are no better examples of storytelling and very few that can equall it.  Tolken filled a void that had been missing in western culture since the acient greeks (or at least the Nordic tribes) stopped writing.  He has created a modern myth.  In doing this he started a style of writing that focuses on the basics of storytelling.  This writing syle is based of how imaginative the storytelling is, more than the ideas that the writing conveys.<br />  Tolken manages to bring the story together in a way that is somthing in between Homer's epics and the classic fairy tales.  The plotlines of these books are both generic and incredibly origonal.  It has all of the elements that make stories like Star Wars so entertaining to everyone, while at the same time leaving the knowing that the book was about more than adventure, it was about finding some piece of bravery within themselves.<br />  The fact that the story is mostly told through the eyes of the hobbits is important.  The hobbits give the reader a veiw of a world that is bigger than it would if they were human.  This is supposed to make the reader relate to when they have felt small, and as if all of the events in the world are just too big for them to control.  The actions of most of the humans is told in a very aloof fashion, as if it happens above the tasks that Bilbo or Frodo are trying to acomplish.<br />  Whatever people get out of the Lord of the Rings, Tolken has created what is probably the perfect story.  All fatasy is in  some way tring to reacreate the feel and imagination that this story created.	2000-12-20
US	48608301	R3DVULWTHK99C3	0553285653	26251333	Grass	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Wonderfully imaginative story.	I consider this book to be Tepper best work.  Tepper has created a book that has won me over on vision alone.  She is perhaps the best sci-fi author at using imaginative metaphors to bring out the best of her novels.  <br />      Most sci-fi authors try to write action novels of some kind to bring out their ideas.  Tepper manages to work on a more emotional level.  It is hard to come up with very specific ideas about faith that come up in this book (And this book is very much about religon).  The story works more throught the mood and imagery that the characters create.  Her supporting characters in her books are very often intentally two diminsional.  They exist more to protray steotypes or ideas.  Tepper managanges this so succesfull that I can belive in her archtype characters more than I can many authors most important characters.	2000-12-14

As I read the first half of this book, I was facinated by the world that Simon R. Green had created.  On style I would rate this first book in this series a five.  It manages to combine A Romanesque emipire and mix it with 16th century Europe, and adds in in modern punk culture.  Amazingly he makes this work somehow.  On the surface the characters are just really neat.  <br />      This alone carries the series through the first two books.  Unfortuantly the storyline lets the rest of the series down.  The more I read this book the more it became clear that there were no real characters just a bunch of odd fighting machines that seemed to choose sides almost at random.  But even with this the world kept me enthralled enough that I managed to read through the third book.  The only reason I couldn't read on was because the characters just simply became too strong.  By the second bood six people are attacking armies and winning without breaking a sweat.  <br />    Too bad, this had the makings of a trully great pulp action sereis.	2000-12-12
US	48608301	R2JCDDKNRVMBNB	0060955449	2759931	Profiles in Courage (Perennial Classics)	Books	5	12	13	N	N	A must read for anybody who follows politics	JFK's profiles in courage, is simply a look at six differnent senetors who faced tough situations, and made the right choice.  This book is about how people can overcome popular opinion and the pressure of their peers to make a desion that they know is right.  What JFK points out is that while in hindsight many of these choices that were made by these politicans were very obviously correct, they went aginst overwhelming odds to what was right.  If the people examined in this book had lacked this courage, the Lousiana purchace whould still be French, Andrew Johnson would have been expelled from office and congress would have almost totall power over this country.<br />      This is not a book with a lot of brilliant politcal commentary, but a book showing people just what pressures that people who are in high office face, and what characteristics they must have to overcome them.  Everyone who votes should have to read this book, just so they can know what courage it has taken to build this country.	2000-12-08

Robert Jordans latetest book, has all of the plot problems the last two books showed up in a magnified form.  Unlike his earlier works the plot seems forced at times, and I got the impression that Jordan doesn't really quite know where all of his characters are going.  The deepest concern that I have is that much of the character devolopment seems to be slowing down or stoping.  The characters are just somehow too predictable or too familiar.  Maybe its just that I am getting older (I was fourteen when I started reading this series almost six years ago.) but the characters seem to be getting more juvenile every book.  With the exeption of Rand none of the characters seemed to have learned anything more about themselves, since the series started.<br />  Compared to his earlier works this book seems as if it were quickly thrown together, and not well thought out.  Jordan has started letting his character lead him around in circles when he should be letting the plot drag these characters along for the ride.	2000-11-15

Like the Foundation series Song of ice and fire is written with the basic model of a historic event.  While the foundation series is based off of the fall of the roman empire, Song of ice and fire is based off of Englands war of the roses.  Both of these series take real human events and turn them into execellent fiction that is both deeper and more entertaning than what I have come to expect from a fatasy or science fiction author.<br />  What sets this book apart is how Martin uses a first person writing style to explain the characters actions, but he does it in a way that is barely noticalble.  The characters in this series are not only well thought out they each have different and often subtle motivations that change resolably in reaction to the events that soround them.  There are no real boo hoo plotlines and no miraculous changes of heart.  Every time a character does somthing suprizing, it is because the view that the character had been seen through was one sided, or just didn't know all of the facts.  This is also not the usuall fell good series.  Every major character good or bad is a target to be killed.  The bad guys win just as much as the good.  And most importantly there are no real super characters.  In most other series there is a character usully the lead, who has the abilitly to single-handly kill all of his enemys heal the sick, and make all of the women in the story tall and beutifull.  This series has none of that.  The leaders are just as mortal as slaves.  The champions lose when they face impossible odds and the characters good or bad who fight the smartest are the ones that win.	2000-11-10
