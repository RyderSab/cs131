The most brilliant thing about this extremely slim volume is it's title.  Any ambitious person in a corporate setting will want what the book promises.  Unfortunately, the promise is not fulfilled.  <br /> <br />One problem is the book is most applicable to retail or manufacturing.  The central insight of the book deals with inventory turnover.  That may be fine for Dell Computers, but CEOs of companies that develop software don't care about inventory, because there is none.  The entire service/information economy is more or less ignored. <br /> <br />Overall I found the book interesting and worthwhile.  But if you strip away the folksy tales about fruit vendors in the third world and anecdotes about the CEO of Ford, what you have left is a short pamphlet. <br /> <br />I would guess this book contains information my CEO would probably would want me to know.  But I am pretty sure my CEO would want me to know a whole lot more than whats in this book.	2005-08-11

This book was apparantly written 20 years ago.  If you own a 20 year old car, this book is a goldmine.  If you own a more recent model, this book is better than nothing, but not nearly as good as getting the Haynes (or similar) manual for your particular vehicle.  Or for that matter, any other car repair book written in a more recent decade.<br /><br />I can't speak for the entire series, but you really would be a dummy to buy this particular book.<br />------original review----------------------------------<br />First, an observation.  This book starts out explaining what a screwdriver is, and proceeds to attempt to explain complex repairs such as servicing the distributor.  If you really don't know what a screwdriver is, this book can't help you.  And if you attempt to service the ignition system because you read this book, you will need real help, and possibly hospitalization.<br /><br />The book explains in great detail outmoded automotive technology.  Anybody driving a car with drum breaks and carburetor needs a job, not a how-to book.<br /><br />The book is liberally infested with cut-away line drawings of various car systems.  Most are confusing, none are explained well.<br /><br />The book is chock full of esoteric details, but lacks coherent explanation.  This is the way engineers generally write (I speak from experience here).  As it turns out, the author has zero technical credentials, yet she claims sole authorship.  Could be.<br /><br />All in all, one of the worst books it has ever been my misfortune to purchase.	2005-07-25

The fact that other reviewers called it a \\"classic\\" should have tipped me off. <br /> <br />I did enjoyed reading it, so much so that I read the entire book the same day I got it.  I especially like his advice on how to choose an ad agency.   <br /> <br />I imagine much of the advice is as true today as it was in 1960, but a lot of the advice is as dated as Ed Sullivan.

I purchased this book in the digital version, being too impatient to wait for delivery.  I soon found that supreme patience was required to ferret out the information I was looking for. <br /> <br />First the good news: the (e)book is thorough and structured.  A lot of valuable details are brought to focus. If you are seeking information on the mechanics of organizing and running a focus group, I think this would be a good start.  <br /> <br />However, I also want to know how to collect data from a Focus Group, and how to interpret the data.  This it turns out is a research project in and of itself, since this information is scattered in various chapters, and the formal discussion only begins on page 87. <br /> <br />I eventually found the information I was looking for, although the level of detail was a bit thin.  I just find it fascinating that a book intended to serve the advertising industry has it's punchline on page 87.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-18

I am planning a new business, and payed for this book, along with express shipping, since it is very topical.  I feel cheated since the book is completely worthless.  My only consolation is writing this review. <br /> <br />There is not enough information in this book to make a newspaper article.  Aside from very short interviews with Angels that are scattered randomly among the pages, the book consists of constant repitition of a few very simple ideas: <br /> <br />1. Angels invest their own money, VC invest other peoples <br />2. Some Angels may be able to help you with your business.  Some may not. <br />3. Don't waste potential investors time, make sure your business plan is short and reasonable. <br /> <br />Thats the whole book.

It then offers to categorize you and me and everybody in China by the simple expedient of answering 5 questions, one of which usually has to do with whether you are the oldest of youngest child.

My perspective is colored by the fact that I have taken professional training in time management (both through work and privately), and work as a project manager in high tech.  <br />  <br /> I found this book very useful, in that it covered many useful techniques. However, most of the information is not focused on time management per se, rather on how to be successful in life.  <br />  <br /> Chapter 2 contains 5 pages of tactics on using &quot;to-do&quot; lists, the heart of time management. Elsewhere, the subject of avoiding wasting time is covered, although if you have a tendency in this direction, I doubt this book will change your life.  <br />  <br /> The rest of the book covers such (important) topics as managing staff (ch. 11), increasing personal efficiency (ch. 4), managing projects (ch. 13), etc. These subjects each deserve their own book. For that matter, so does the subject of tactics to better manage your time, which is what I mistakely presumed I was getting.	2004-08-01

Surely Mr. Paulos is outstanding in that regard, and he has no business blaming mathematics or anything other than his own lack of character for his stock market fiasco.<br />Time was, if you did something shameful or grossly stupid, you suffered sociatal approbation.  Mr. Paulos, in keeping with current ethos, chose to write a book about it.  <br />Mr. Paulos regals his readers with how he managed his investments, which is a chronocol of almost every mistake a person could make: <BR>   $he bought at the top<BR>   $he did'nt put in a stop-loss order<BR>   $he used margins to increase his investment<BR>   $he willfully ignored all signals that something was wrong<BR>   $he threw good money after bad<BR>   $he was unlucky to have chosen Worldcom in the first place<br />Interspersed with this confessional is a lot of mathematically oriented stories which illustrate the counter-intuitive nature of probability.  If you are interested in the psychology of investing, I highly recommend &quot;Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes&quot; by Blesky.  <br />Perhaps the silliest thing about this book is that Paulos does not even entertain the possibility that it is theoreticlly possible to beat the market.  It seems obvisous that if some people (such as Mr. Paulos) have above average losses, somebody somewhere has to have above average gains.   Mr. Paulos, who is obviously highly intellegent, seems unable to make this observation.  <br />This book is a two hundred page affirmation of what anybody who ever went to high school already knows: the smartest kids in the class often lack common sense.	2004-07-03

The real value of this book lies Mr. Morris's commentary which draws into focus the fundamental similarities between seemingly unrelated financial disasters. <br />It is banal to observe that the future is likely to include some as-yet unforseen financial meltdown.  Armegeddon-peddlers, chicken-littlers, and perpetual bears have been saying this for centuries.  It it brilliance on the part of Mr. Morris to explain exactly why this is the case.<br />Mr. Morris debunks the garden varieties of conventional wisdom, which variously held that financial crisis are &quot;caused&quot; by currency speculators, Michael Milken, junk bonds traders, Jews, computer trading programs, etc.  Mr. Morris demonstrates that all crisis run a predictable course: economic innovation and growth, corresponding financial innovation provide capital to fuel the growth, over-shoot of valuations of the new financial mechanisms by financial markets chasing high yields, and the invevitable crash and ensuing chaos.<br />The USA Savings and Loan debacle, Asian currency crisis, British investments in post Civil War USA railroads are all shown as variations on this theme.<br />I did not award 5 stars because the book often delves into complex financial mechanisms which could have been explained in a more layman friendly manner.	2004-06-21

I rate it 5 stars because it provides actual strategies and methods that can be easily employed by the average investor.  However, I want to clearly state at the beginning of this review that I do not recommend anyone actually use this book as an investment guide.  Most people will lose money if they try to implement this book.<br />The first of three sections is an explanation of why this style of investing is profitable.  The middle section is devoted to technical charting to identify the bottom of a falling stock.  The third section is devoted to case studies.<br />I would not recommend this book to anybody I know personally, since there is a very real danger that a person will actually try to invest using this system, and will lose a great deal of money.  <br />However, an investor with the desire to get above average returns, who has a proven ability to deal with stress of risky investments, can use the information in this book very profitably.  <br />Who do I think can profit from this book?  Anyone who has actually experienced losing over 30% of their portfolio, and were able to profit from the experience (either by buying more at the bottom when everybody else was trying to get out, or simply having the patience and character hold onto your stocks).  So unless you have been invested during at least one major stock market crash, and profited (either financially, or learned a lesson about fear/greed/panic) I would definately not recommend this book.  Ignore this warning at your own risk.	2004-06-12

Ms. Klugman's book is definately one of the best I've read.<br />She makes a very cogent arguement for this style of investing, which in a nutshell is:<br />1. Dividend growth shields investors from emotional turmoil of having your investments sink in value, since these stocks tend to stand up well and also because of the dividend income stream.  This is very important if you have a low threshold for financial panic.<BR>2. Dividend growth provides relatively small income streams at first, presumably when you don't need income (and when your taxes are highest), but it grows so that at retirement you will have a large annual income.<BR>3. Dividend growth strategy should have much higher returns than bonds, since your dividend income will grow, while bonds pay static returns.<BR>4. If you hold stocks in an IRA and just live off the dividends and pass the stocks to your heirs, it is a perfect tax shelter for transfering huge amounts of wealth, since all the capital gains on the stocks are not taxable when the stocks are inherited.<br />Ms. Klugman does mention in passing that Dividend Growth is not necessarily the highest return strategy, and probably will not even keep pace with an index fund.  However, Ms. Klugman makes a very compelling case for this style of investing.  In addition, her observations about the Wall Street in general are insightful and make good reading.<br />I have read over 20 books on investing.  This is the among the few that I am still mulling it over 2 weeks after I finished reading it.	2004-04-23

I can recommend this book because it provides a comprehensible survey of the development of money.  <br />This is no small accomplishment, since it is all to easy for a history of money to get bogged down in details and to miss the big picture.  Money is at once a fantastically abstract concept (try explaining it to somebody who has never used any) and so common place that it is like water to a fish, it is the very world we live within.<br />After reading this book, I felt for the first time that the curtains had been pulled aside, and I had a concept of what money &quot;is&quot;.  I have read few other books on economics that succeded in making understandable highly abstract concepts.  That accounts for my 4 stars.	2004-02-14

In all seriosness, there is almost no useful advice in this book about how to pick stocks.<br />What this book does explain, in extravagent detail, is why you should not pick stocks, you should use a mutual fund, and while we are on the subject, the Acorn fund (which is run by Ralph) has made lots of money.  Also Acorn lost some money here and there, you shouldn't get the impression that the author is claiming infallability.<br />In all fairness, this was a fairly interesting read, and provided some good general insights into investing.  But as far as useful insights into choosing small, rapidly growing companies, the reader is left with the impression that this can only be done by professionals.  A legitimate viewpoint, except for the fact that this is exactly what the book promises (fraudulently, in my estimation) to explain how to do.	2004-02-13

This book has 2 problems, which account for my low rating:<br />1. This book is focused only on &quot;trading&quot; and not investing.  In other words, it seeks to maximize short term profits, and does not deal with the investor who is willing to take risks and ride out adversity and selling opportunities for a profit in the long term.  Unfortunately, this orientation is not explained in the book description, and is only stated as a &quot;by the way&quot; on page 87.  I probably would not have bought it if I had known this.  For the investor, this book is of very limited value.  It is hard for me to judge the value to traders, since I am not very knowledgable on the subject.<br />2. The bulk of this book is explanation of technical sell indicators.  There is no attempt to connect between them, merely to catalog all the various &quot;sell&quot; signs.  The fact that many of the indicators may contradict themselves with an individual stock is not dealt with.  <br />On the positive side, the first part of the book lays out a laundry list of reasons why there is a bias against selling, ranging from the nature of the brokerage industry to behavioral economics.  I found this part of the book very interesting and fresh, and it provided useful food for thought about my own patterns of selling.  If you can find the book cheaply, it is worth the price for the first section alone, even if you are an investor and not a trader.	2004-01-30

Four Pillars is one of the best of the 15 investing books I have read.   It is noteworthy because the book:<br />   * integrates numerous theories of investing (Indexing, Efficient Market, Portfolio theory).<BR>   * places returns of various asset classes (large/small/growth/value stocks, bonds, REITs, minerals, cash) into historical perspective, then lays out a clear argument why the future may not resemble the past. <BR>   * provides extensive evidence why investors should steer clear of brokerages, mutual funds, and the cheerleading financial news industries.<BR>   * Bernstein has a colorful command of the language.<br />It would be no problem to give more details of why this book is outstanding, and I think other reviewers have done just that.  I will instead explain why I rated this book four and not five stars:<br />    * Bernstein is an Efficient Markets proponent, claiming that the markets are wiser than any individual investor or money manager.  He concludes there is no room for stock picking.  On the other hand, he observes, in his own inimitable style, \\"once a generation the markets go barking mad\\".  Well, which is it?  If the markets are efficient, then they will never go barking mad.  And if they occasionally go barking mad, then they aren't always efficient.<BR>    * Bernstein claims that it is a fool's game to try to beat the markets (seeing as how they are efficient).  He then proceeds to claim that Portfolio Management can consistently and over the long run beat the markets (albeit by less than 1%).  Perhaps he should have added a caveat to his statements rather than create the appearance of internal contradiction.<BR>    * Bernstein makes extensive use of statistics to prove that, on average, the average investor cannot do better than the market average.  He then goes on to prove that it is highly unusual for investors to have returns that are statistically unlikely.  While this is simply a tautology,  it is presented as a  great insight into the market.   For that matter, the odds that you have a college degree and have 5 close friends with college degrees is about 1 in 100.   Yet I would wager that most people reading this review fit that category.  Bernstein's observations are technically correct, but are a good example of Mark Twain's statement \\"there are lies, damned lies, and statistics\\".   <br />I raise these points not to quibble over the validity of this or that idea in this excellent book, but rather to highlight that this book includes a healthy mixture of investing theory and astute observations, and given the complexity of the market, they do not always fit perfectly.<br />I have only one complaint.  Bernstein waits till nearly the end to state that he is only referring to long term investing for retirement.  Personally, I like to play the market with money I can afford to lose, and I generally \\"swing for the fences\\".  Four Pillars is downright derisive towards this type activity.  This caused me cosmic dissonance until I divined this unstated assumption.	2003-05-27

The author is a journalist, and he quite happily combines anecdotes and quantitative analysis to present a compelling story of wealth creation.<br />Although the book covers a lot of ground, the theme of the virtue of free markets and the mischief of big government recurs frequently.  The author points out the paradox (to Westerners) of how authoritarian regimes in Asia have in a single generation lifted hundreds of millions of Asians out of poverty, while more democratic and socialist governments have created a legacy of depravation.  The comparisons between China and India are the most poignant.  A few quotes:<br />\\"How can it possibly have happened that...China's authoritarian government has delivered far greater benefits to the average Chinese than India's fairly stable and democratically elected governments have delivered to the average Indian?  The short answer is ...China's government has followed policies which, because they rely on...markets to set prices and allocate resources, spread the benefits of economic growth pretty widely through society.  In India, by contrast, ...rulers have acted almost entirely at the behest of...the better off.\\" (pg. 173)<br />\\"After 1978, China grew by letting competition flourish; before 1991, India tried to grow by eliminating as much of it as possible because it was \\"wasteful\\".\\" (pg. 177)<br />\\"For almost thirty years Taiwan and Sourth Korea were run by rather nasty military dicatatorships.  Yet there, and in Hong Kong and Singapore too, the authoritarian approachwas not only more efficient economically than democratic decision making; it proved to be more egalitarian as well-for the simple reason that it is the rare lobby in a democracy that wins government benfits for the poor rather than the previileged.\\" (pg. 326).<br />The book is such a page turner, I was dreading finishing it.  It is a tour-de-force, with thought provoking content dealing with politics, culture, policy, family life, and many other topics.  I found myself pausing frequently to reflect on my own life, my values, and the society I live in.  In this sense \\"Asia Rising\\" is a great book, not just a great economics book.	2002-02-21

I found relatively little information on that subject, and the information I did find was of a general nature.  <br />I got the impression that if you are interested in a survey of issues dealing with mechnaical failures, you might find more to like in this book.	2002-01-21

I am currently a project manager on my first assignment, after 12 years in engineering.  I selected this book because I was intrigued by the possiblity  of using &quot;visualizing&quot; techniques to deal with the overwhelming details of project management.  The book fell short in almost every possible way:<br />1. There is virtually no use of &quot;visualization&quot;.  (If you don't believe me, check out the appendix, which lists just one reference for &quot;visualization&quot;).  There is a diagram which integrates 17 different concepts, and in the CD ROM you can manipulate the diagram to look at it from different angles.  Unfortunately, it did not in any way simplify or &quot;visualize&quot; a set of complex issues, it merely cobbled them together on the same page.<br />2. The book is apparantly written by and for managers of large government or industrial projects.  One mans Project Manager is another mans Manager of the Department of Project Managment. <br />3. My hat is off to the other reviewers who characterized this approach as &quot;simple&quot;.  I often found myself rereading paragraphs and flipping back and forth trying to work out what the author had in mind.  The book describes &quot;The Four Project Management Essentials&quot;, &quot;The Three Project Aspects&quot;, &quot;The <BR>Ten Project Management Elements&quot;.  You need merely keep in mind these 17 different concepts while you ponder such statements as <br />&quot;A complex verification process may over-drive cost and schedule and be the determining factor when considering alternative concepts&quot; (pg. 94).  <br />4. The book is poorly organized.  The first six chapters keep referring to chapter 7.  After my curiosity could no longer be repressed, I flipped forward to chapter 7, which I discovered is 187 pages long, well over half the book.<br />5. The Project Manager is compared to a Symphony Conductor, who directs the coordinated efforts oftalented projessionals in creating coordinated harmony.  This image is a constant theme in the book, one which, to put it mildly, does not resonate with my experience.<br />6. The text does not teach Project Mangement techniques, it merely introduces them.  If I wanted to adapt anything recommended in the book, I would be obliged to look elsewhere for all details.  Gantt charts are introduced, but MS Project is never mentioned (nor is Primavera TeamPlay for that matter).  The spreadsheet, which I find to be the single most useful and versitile PjM tool, is not mentioned at all.<br />I think the authors do not make any unfounded statements, and they have done a reasonably complete job of catalogueing PjM techniques.  I just did not find the book useful.	2001-12-30

The technical information is well organized and presented from more than one perspective.  Rather than presenting volumes of minute details, architectural principals are introduced and illuminated.    <br />This is one of the outstanding technical books that I have ever read.  I would highly recommend it to experienced hands in the fields of wireless or wireline voice networks.  <br />I would also recommend it to beginners with the following cavaet: this book plumbs some fairly deep waters, and does not delve too deeply into the related fields that are the building blocks of Wireless Intellegent Networking.  SS7, AIN, PSTN architecture, and mobility management are all presented, but having some previous background (or somebody handy who can fill in details) would be a big help.	2001-07-01

It is of great interest today, since it provides much needed perspective on the origins and growth of the wireless industry, and the nature of projections offered today about the next 5-10 years.  <br />The author is intellegent and well versed in the wireless industry, and presents a compelling vision of &quot;personal communications&quot;.  The current (2001) crisis in the telecom industry provides an interesting contrast to his forward looking vision.	2001-07-01

However, I found this book to be unnecessarily difficult to read.  <br />The the book presents inherently complex material, which testifies to the proficiency of the authors.  However, it was often not clear what point the authors were trying to make, especially regarding graphs which lacked clear explanations.  Often I had to to re-read an entry several times before I understood what the authors were trying to express.  <br />I am sure the book contains a wealth of valuable information (which is why I ordered it), but I personally was unwilling to invest the time and energy necessary to fathom the authors intent.<br />I am a systems engineer for an international telecom company.	2001-06-24

With remarkable lucidity, this book draws out the connections between exile, redemption, Yehudah, Yoseph, Greece, Israel, Levy,  thanksgiving, charm, money, and many others.  The resulting picture is both powerful and personally inspiring.<br />This book may prove challenging to readers who are not well versed in Jewish religion.	2000-11-19

I am not knowledgable enough in tax law to pass judgement on the quality of the information presented here.  Expat tax law is complicated and intricate, involving many special cases which may not apply to you.  The work book overcomes this through careful organization of chapters and topics.  It is possible to locate topics of interest without having wade through large amounts of unrelated material.  I gave this work book the fifth star for it's spiral binding, which makes it much easier to work with.	2000-11-02

I bought this book  together with &quot;Fundamentals of Venture Capital&quot; and  &quot;Start-Up&quot; and read all three.  Compared to the others, this book  is full of inane, unsubstantiated, or simply mystifying concepts (many of  which are trademarked).  <br />I really don't know enough about raising  capital to state that this book is nonsense.  But if there is valuable  information in this book, the author has done a remarkable job of hiding  it.	2000-09-07

Sivy's book provided me with a comprehensive overview of  investing strategies.  The author has a witty and readable writing style.   The basics of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, foreign stocks, etc. are all  covered.  Also covered were the basic investing strategies, including  value, growth, business cycle, inflation cycle, income.  I suspect that a  person with no background in stocks or economics would find this book  challenging.  This edition is from 1996, and contains some information that  has been overtaken by events.  Aside from this, I would have awarded this  book 5 stars.	2000-09-03

I am new to this field, and am a  potential enterpreneur, which by definition makes me a potential investor.   The book is written by a lawyer who  shares his considerable experience  advising both venture capitalists and enterpreneurs.  The legal aspects  that are discussed are of supreme importance, and this book offered me some  valuable insights into the dynamics of enterpreneurship.  If, like myself,  you are a not familiar with the field, I would recommend this as the second  or third book you read.  I bought this book together with \\"High Tech  Start Up\\", which I read first (and highly recommend).  I have to admit  that it is likely that there was a lot in this book that I did not fully  understand. I will be using the book for cross reference with my other  information sources.  ---Update June 2007----------------  Having recently re-read \\"Fundamentals..\\" I still think this is one of the best business books I have ever read.  The book is useful far beyond the realm of venture capitalism.  Anyone in the process of starting a new venture that requires risk capital would find a lot of value in this book.	2000-08-22
