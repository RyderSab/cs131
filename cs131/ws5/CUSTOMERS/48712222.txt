Despite the fact that her dialogue is laughable (writes like a 70 year old even though her characters are 30 somethings), and her plots are getting totally predictable, I am always engrossed by her books until the very last word on the very last page.  The thing is she still knows how to concoct a swift and enjoyable read, that makes at least this reader forget all the flaws.  She will always be one of my favorites.	2005-04-21

The author's writing style perfectly depicted late 18th Century England, and the mysteries themselves were always suspenseful, fun and perfectly plotted.  While this one was not quite up to the earlier ones, and it really was evident that others were involved in the writing, it still merits 5 stars because it was truly a great end for characters who really began to seem like old friends.  Even though the author wrote many other types of work, he will clearly live on in the readers' minds for this wonderful series.	2005-04-14

In one stroke of the pen, she has totally obliterated all of it.  George is, of course, the one who created these characters, and she certainly owes nothing to the readers, so she can certainly write their histories however she wants.  However, as someone who has read all the books in this series, largely because of the relational aspects of these five wonderful characters, I find it very difficult to even conceive of reading another book in this series.  In fact, she'd be much better off using this book as the end of this series, which she could certainly do given the ending, and start something new.  There was just no excuse for what she did in this book.	2005-04-07

The action in this book is non-stop, and the emotion, which has always been a high point in this series, is palpable. I also feel, like another reviewer, that this was the best portrayal of the Hester/Monk relationship, and I really liked the payoff for the Rathbone character.  The way this book tied up loose ends and resolved stories, it could actually be a fitting end for this series, although I certainly hope the author has many more Monk books in her.	2004-05-17

BUT, this book was really quite poor.  I had trouble even following the arguments/plot, and the lead female character was, &quot;like so annoying.&quot;  This was akin to Patricia Cornwell's ridiculous attempt to write about Jack the Ripper.  Smith, like Cornwell, needs to stick to what she does best, which appears to be psychological mystery like the Reisden/Perdita series.	2003-10-29

For one thing, the silly Inner Circle plot is gone from this book.  For another thing, all the major characters play significant roles in solving a mystery that, while quite complex, is understandable and, at its conclusion, makes perfect sense.  This was a very satisfying return to form for Perry.  Hopefully, this will continue into her next Monk book, because those too have been a little off kilter for awhile.	2003-04-30

I challenge anyone to tell me the difference between Joe, Logan, Galen and Morgan, or between Eve, Sarah, Elena and Alex.  The fact is, there is no difference.  All of her recent characters are interchangeable, and all of her plots are basically the same, with the same annoying and stilted dialogue.  All that said, the author still somehow manages to create a fast paced and interesting story, and even makes the reader root for her copycat characters.  This author is clearly just writing the same thing over and over again because it's easy and it sells.  It's too bad because even this repetitive stuff is 3-star, but she could so easily be 5 star with a little freshness and ingenuity in her work.	2003-04-30
US	48712222	R1VVLI7EOE0MPW	0385336195	912945855	The Best Revenge	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Revelation On White	After having read this book and The Program, which are very similar in that they focus on two major characters who happen to be getting therapy from Gregory, rather than focusing on Gregory and Lauren, I have come to the conclusion that White's success is purely because of his excellent plots.  Gregory, Lauren and Purdy are nowhere near as interesting as, for example, Alex Delaware, Milo Sturgis and Robin Castagna, but where White really shines is in creating ripping good mysteries.  That is why, when we don't have to read so much of Alan's simpering, these books become all the better.  And, in this book, we didn't see much of Alan and Lauren at all.  That's why, all the way until the ending, the book was White's best.  I will say, however, that I did not like the ending, because that was the one place he chose to put the focus back on Alan, instead of leaving it on Kelda and Clone, who are truluy memorable characters.  So, my advice to White is keep writing Gregory novels, but keep deemphasizing him and, instead, emphasize his patients.	2003-04-07

The main character in this book was the best of all her characters, and the way she interweaves the fictional plot with real events is just amazing.  Through reading this series, the reader learns a tremendous amount of interesting history, and also will meet unforgettable fictional characters.  To anyone interested in Irish history, and/or just a series of good books, I would recommend reading 1916, 1921 and most definitely 1949, preferably one after the other, because there are so many recurring characters that they may become hard to remember if one of the arlier books was read too long ago.	2003-03-13

I could pretty much write the next Johansen book and not be too far off by just following her usual formula.  That said, however, I actually though this book was slightly better than some of her other recent formulaic efforts.  She actually found some other word to use besides bull and damn, and I actually thought the interaction between Galen and Elena was fairly well described and believable.  As usual with the writer she's become, I would say that if you are a Johansen fan, you'll like this book, but if this is the first Johansen you've read, you'll be dissapointed.	2002-11-04

The mystery was great, and the personal interplay between Hester, Monk and Rathbone was excellent.

I'd say, beyond a doubt, that this was the best one yet.  Lucas has evolved from a borderline, rather unlikeable, psychotic in the early books into an extremely likeable, almost sympathetic character, and his detecting ability makes him seem almost Holmesian at times.  I also really liked Sandford's characterization of Clara Rinker.  I just wish there was some way he could have created a more Daniel-Silvaesque ending for this rivalry.  A great, great read.	2002-05-21

White started out a little slowly, but his books have gotten better and better, to the point that I think this one was one of the best psychological mysteries/thrillers I have ever read.  The thing that is most noteworthy about this book is that White managed to keep 3 plots -- any one of which could have been a standalone -- all going to tremendous conclusions.  Even though I did guess the resolution of all the plots, that did nothing to detract from this book.  In fact, it shows the book's fairness to the reader, since the story contained sufficient clues, and was internally consistent enough, to allow the puzzle to be solved.  This is a great, great read, and who knows, next year I may even say that Alan is better than Alex.	2002-05-01

I believe this was the best of all.  Contrary to a few of the other reviews, I thought this Holmes was very true to form, and that the author absolutely nailed Watson.  I also thought he did a good job capturing the Titanic scene.  I recommend this highly to anyone who likes Holmes or the lore of the Titanic.	2002-04-24
US	48712222	R2Y4FLRPCWHSNC	0743206045	991690611	Daddy's Little Girl	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Getting Better Again	Clark's first 4 or 5 books were so good that I'll always buy her new stuff.  However, since those first works, her efforts are uneven at best, and, particularly lately, I've given her books 2 or 3 stars only, and would probably have given them worse except that they were by her.  This book, however, recaptured some, although not all, of her ability to create characters the reader wants to root for and very suspenseful situations.  Still, however, the suspense here was a bit contrived, and there was not enough of it.  But the lead character was good and I think she did better with dialogue(which in some of her other works is almost embarrassingly stilted and too old for the age of her characters) because she adopted the first person.  I think she needs to do the same thing from now on.  This still was nowhere near as good as Where Are The Children and A Stranger Is Watching, but it's a good and fast read.	2002-04-23

King made a conscious decision to marry these two, rather than simply make them partners ala Holmes and Watson.  Since she did that, I at least think she ought to have them act like they are married.  They seem to have far less affection between them than Sherlock and the Doc did.  I always thought, when reading all of the canon, that Holmes really had a great deal of fire and passion beneath his veneer, as demonstrated by his feelings for Irene Adler.  I think King owes it to her fascinating Russell character to start writing some of that into the series.  I will say, however, that, otherwise, the mystery in this book was very good, as were the secondary characters.	2002-04-17

However, while that problem led me to really rate her last book low, because I just didn't like the characters, I like the Eve Duncan character so much that even the author's stilted and sometimes silly writing and plot twists cannot dissuade me from wanting to find out what happens.  Basically, I give Johansen credit for having created very memorable characters(all she needed to add was more Logan and the characters would have been perfect), but I just can't understand why her writing ability has dropped so much from her early books(for example, the Ugly Duckling, which was just great).  All in all, if you like the Eve Duncan series, read this; if you don't, or if this is your first Johansen, it will probably not make much of an impression on you.	2002-04-10

The last Cross novel was so bad I almost decided not to get this book, but I really liked the first novel in this series, so I decided to give this second one a try.  This was vintage Patterson -- a taut, gripping story, well written, with an interesting plot that really held together.  I read the 390 pages in a little less than 2 hours -- the book was that good.  If only he could continue to write Cross novels as well as he writes this new series.  For anyone who was as disturbed by his last poor effort as I was, you'll feel much better if you read this.	2002-03-27

The mystery itself was taut(although the solution does sort of come from left field), and, as always, she sets an unmatched Victorian mood.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I still don't think this whole Inner Circle plot is very realistic.  Nonetheless, this is a must read for Perry fans.	2002-03-21
US	48712222	RH2SRV9NJN49	0399148515	826329544	The English Assassin	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Context Counts	Had I not read all of Silva's other books, I would have given this one four or maybe even five stars.  On its own, this is a top notch thriller with loads of action and a good and realistic plot, tackling a timely topic.  HOWEVER, in my view this was nowhere near as good as either of the two Michael Osbourne books or even the previous Allon book(and I thought even that work was a decline from the Osbourne books).  The characters are not as well developed here as in previous books and, with the exception of the nice twist with the assassin(which is a plot device Silva often uses and which I really like), the ending is kind of weak.  Moreover, some of the characters, particularly Shamron, act totally out of character based on what we've seen in previous books(which is something authors often do that I really don't like).  So, if you haven't read any of Silva's other stuff, read this and you'll no doubt enjoy it.  But if you've read his other works and were really waiting for this, you might be disapointed.	2002-03-21

I have read the later books in this series, although it never even excited me enough to make me want to read the pre-Lauren being Mrs. Gregory entries.  I gave the previous entries I read 3 to 4 stars, because they were good, but Gregory pales in comparison to Alex Delaware, and Kellerman's series is really the only viable comparison to this series.  And that's why I really liked this book.  We saw less of Gregory and more of two great, great characters, in Kirsten/Peyton and Carl Luppo.  Gregory himself is a slightly boring protagonist, but not so these characters.  If White makes Kirsten, or even Luppo, turn up in later entries in this series, the series will become much better.	2002-01-28

However, the book was a dissapointment to me, since it was nowhere near as good as either of Silva's previous efforts.  The main characters in this book simply can't compare to Osbourne and Delaroche, and I think he'd do better to resurrect those characters than to stick with Gabriel(which, unfortunately, he appears to have done for his next book).  Also, why have Peel at all if you aren't going to develop that story, and why set up the whole Gabriel/Jackie thing if it is going to fizzle out as it did.	2002-01-22

Delaware, Robin and Milo all age like fine wine.  The plots and the characters keep getting better and better.  Unlike some, I saw nothing improbable in this plot, because the circumstances would have clearly led someone like Delaware to perhaps take some bizarre chances in trying to find out what happened to Lauren.

Perhaps the fact that the novel lacked suspense was inevitable given that Patterson gave away the mastermind's identity at the end of Roses.  That said, however, even apart from that there just wasn't nearly the same level of suspense as in the other Cross books.  I actually could hav lived with Alex ending after Roses, but this book was so average that he better write another, because such a great character deserves to go out on a much higher note than this.  Maybe Jamilla can become part of the club in the other Patterson series and then Alex can work with them to solve the next serial killings in SF.	2001-11-29

In fact, this was one of the best Fidelma mysteries.  As always, Fidelma is positively Holmesian in her deductive abilities, and she is a much more multi-faceted character than the illustrious Mr. H.  Also, Tremayne always creates memorable characters, both the foils and the criminals, and, for the most part(certainly here), cracking good mysteries.  Also, there was a nice teaser at the end that leaves the reader definitely anticipating the next entry in the series.  (...).  Anyway, a great read.	2001-11-12

However, his recent stuff simply pales in comparison to his earlier works, and this book is a prime example.  Little girl lost is NOT what King does best, and using that as his premise doomed the book from the beginning.  King is at his best when he does sprawling semi-supernatural, semi-horror thrillers like IT and the Stand(two of the best horror works ever written).  He is not at his best with short puff pieces.  Just like Tommie himself is breaking down as a reliever, Steve is, unfortunately, breaking down as an author.	2001-11-08

The Talisman concept was great, and King and Straub seem to have recaptured the magic of their early careers.  However, this book was prevented from being five stars by a terrible ending and by too much reliance on one's knowledge of King's Dark Tower series, which it is unlikely most mystery lovers, as opposed to pure King lovers, have read.  So, I give it five stars for everything up to the ending and 1 star for the ending, averaging out to three.  I do hope, however, that the ending at least means we will be seeing more of Jack at some later date.  One last thing, though.  Since the Territories were involved here, how could there be no wolves, oh, pardon me, wolfs.	2001-10-30

That is evident in the people who thought Arnie was not candid about his feelings on Jack.  In numerous other accounts, those feelings are explored in depth, so if there is a problem in that regard it is a failing in the author, not in Arnie.  Also, I disagree that he doesn't see Jack as the best of all time, because he's said that numerous times.  If there was rancor there on Arnie's part, it was probably because he felt that in Jack's younger days he didn't respect the fans enough, which is probably why I sense some rancor in some of the things Arnie now says about Tiger.  In any event, this is a purely classy guy, who deserves all the accolades he's gotten, and this book gives a good glimpse into his soul.	2001-10-18

And, for the most part, I did think the book was excellent, particularly the main character, who I find to be a very interesting detective.  However, I did have two problems with the book, that keep me from giving it 5 stars.  First of all, in his desire to have the right mix of politically correct characters, the quthor produces quite a few awkward passages since, in alot of spots, the diversity he covets really doesn't fit, and seems contrived.  Second, he should know, since his son, to whom he dedicated the book, is a fairly well known harness racing trainer in Chicago, that everyone who works on the backstretch at a harness track must be fingerprinted.  Yet, from the way he describes these murders, prints must have been left, so the guy would have been identified almost immediately. So, all in all, the book was good but not great, and perhaps a bit inaccurate, but I would definitely read more by this author.	2001-10-17

The key to any Perry book is really not the mystery so much as the cause she tackles and the dynamic interplay between Monk, Hester and whichever supporting players are being accentuated in the book at issue.  However, even the mystery here was quite good, although, as one of the editorial reviewers pointed out, the solution does sort of come out of left field.  But given the truly strong personal interplay between the characters, who cares.  I hope, however, that the absence of Rathbone from this book is not going to be a trend, because I think his character is necessary for all the angst which made this series great to be revisited.	2001-10-17

The plot was chilling and the characterizations were awesome.  And I totally disagree with some of the other revies that questioned the ending.  I thought the ending was excellent, and added an uplifting note to what otherwise was a gruesome(but in a good way)tale.  An absolute must read.	2001-09-04
US	48712222	R1K3ZXMHKX4CTX	0684859726	840593809	Fatal Voyage : A Novel	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Almost Perfect	Reichs is a great writer, and her heroine is totally believable, which makes for a great combination of writing and characterization.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that the actual murder mystery seemed extremely convoluted and contrived.  So, while this may have been her best written book, I also thought it was her worst mystery, hence only four stars.  But I still can't wait for the next one.	2001-08-08

This author just keeps getting better and better.  The plot and the characterizations are unforgettable.  I sincerely regretted it when I reached the end.  If you are a mystery lover like I am, read this book; you'll love it.	2001-08-02

Nobody writes a better English mystery than this American writer.  The characters, both the regulars and the ones she adds for the plot, are perfectly drawn and the dialogue is crisp and realistic.  Even though this book is over 700 pages, there's not one wasted word.  In fact, as for the mystery itself, I think this was one of the best she's written.  My one nit is that she created such memorable characters in Lynley, Simon, Helen and Deb that I wish she'd go back to some of the early novels and spend more pages on their interaction.	2001-07-18

George is alot like Anne Perry in the sense that while her mysteries are good(but not great), her drawing of relationships between the main characters is just outstanding.  That is why I have been so dissapointed in some of her recent efforts where St. James and Deb, and sometimes even Helen, hardly appear.  If you like George because of her character interplay, read this book(although I agree the mystery here is not as good as some of her others).	2001-07-12
US	48712222	R38GCUDXUBW4PN	0553800949	899995514	Final Target	Books	1	4	7	N	N	So Formulaic	I actually liked the first few books by this author that I read.  But when each succeeding book is basically the same, with basically the same dialogue, it gets a little silly.  There is always the brooding, dangerous, slightly illegal hero, with the strong, decent but also slightly illegal sidekick and the heroic, plucky, basically perfect female lead, who always reluctantly falls in love with the brooding hero, all the while saying &quot;bull&quot; and &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;hell&quot; (these sure seem to be her favorite dialogue words) alot.  If you like repeating that formula like groundhog day, you'll love this book; otherwise a time-waster.	2001-06-14

Koontz should be required to go back and re-read this work before he starts each new book.  From the very first page, I couldn't put this book down, and it never let up for a second.  The only other Koontz book that comes close was watchers.  If you read only one Koontz, read Lightning.	2001-06-13

The characters the author picked to study were not at all interesting, they were just scum -- including the sports book managers.  In fact, scum like this is why i avoid the Stardust like the plague.  Scum like this is also why the NCAA wants Congress to ban betting on college sports, which will be a shame for those of us who aren't scum and who just want to enjoy betting on college hoops or pigskins every now and then.  This book is a downer and time-waster -- avoid it like you'd avoid the Stardust sports book.	2001-06-13

Hopefully, she still has one or even two more Dalgliesh novels in her, because this series has always been top notch.  The only problem I have ever had with this series is that there has never really been a full-scale development of Dalgliesh's character(compare the painstaking development of the Lynley character in the Elizabeth George series).  But, in this novel, we at least get more of a glimpse into Dalgliesh.  One quibble, though, is that since she started this series, I believe, in the mid 50's, and Dalgliesh was probably already in his 30's at the time, it is hard to think of him as a fortyish or even fiftyish, virile guy.	2001-06-05

If anything, the Davenport series just keeps getting better.  The storytelling is always great, the murderers are always unforgettably chilling and the dialogue and interaction between Davenport and his crew are always riveting and realistic.  This is one great series, by a great author, and I hope he keeps writing these for a long time to come.  I particularly liked this entry because it brought back more of the interaction between Davenport and Sloan and Del, which I particularly like, and because of the relationships between Davenport and Weather and Kidd and Sherill.	2001-05-17

The story grips the reader from the first sentence right to the end, and the historical detail always adds alot to these books.  Additionally, the writing style itself is so much better than the usual horror novelists(including, for example, King and Koontz in my view).  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, though, was that I think 2 things that happened in this book were, as plot devices, just plain inappropriate.  I won't say what they are, because that would be a spoiler, but I think both could have been changed and the book still would have been great.  Also, I have to say I like DeClerq and Craven better than Zinc, so their absence in this novel didn't help it in my eyes.  Nonetheless, it's still an excellent book.	2001-04-11

However, the sequel did not quite measure up to the original.  I think the major problem was the author's decision to make a secondary character from the first book into the protagonist for this book, when the two protagonists from the first book were so much more interesting.  However, the writing and historical element were excellent as in the first book, and, again, I really felt I developed great insight into this period.	2001-03-05

Her writing almost makes the reader feel they have stepped into this period -- it is that authentic.  I do agree with a reviewer on one minor point, however.  If we really needed the Kathleen story, which I don't think we did, it at least should have been wrapped up.  This book definitely lends itself to a sequel, with the main characters being updated into the events of 1922, with the Collins/deValera split and the eventual realization of Pearce's dream -- sort of.  No doubt there would also be a divergence of views among the main characters as to which 1922 faction to support, and that would make for a fascinating development of those events.	2001-02-19

Several industry reviewers ranked this in their top 5 books of all time, so naturally I thought it was a must read.  Yet, I thought the book was extremely boring, and could have been condensed into about one-third of its size by eliminating all the surplus and uninteresting details he included.  I contrast this effort with On The Beach, which is also often listed by these same industry reviewers in the top 5 scariest books, and which really does deliver.  This book would have been much better as a semi-fictionalized effort than as a total non-fiction piece.	2001-02-19

I have to confess that I've never liked this series as much as the Monk series, although I do think that some books in this series(especially the earlier ones) are quite good.  Lately, however, the author has undertaken, in my view, far too much development of subsidiary characters, so much so that, in this book, Pitt and Charlotte almost take a back seat to the others.  Also, I'm surprised noone noticed the total artificiality of the plot device.  Pitt and Charlotte have rich and well-connected relatives, in Emily and Jack, and an even richer and more well-connected benefactress in Vespasia, yet we are expected to believe that Pitt had no choice but to accept this potentially suicidal banishment.  Come on.	2001-02-13

The subject matter of the book, and the way it is treated, however, make this one of the best books i've ever read.  His vision of how the world might end seems uncannily prophetic, since he posits a situation where it was renegade groups in small countries that caused the whole thing, which is what would probably happen if there ever was world destruction.  Also, the notion of a whole country going on with life as usual, but knowing its days are numbered and there is nothing that can be done was quite compelling.  An unforgettable read.	2000-11-16

That is because the subject matter, and the way the author handled it, was stunning.  First of all, writing as he was in a time when everyone thought one of the superpowers would push the button, he was uncannily accurate in his hypothesis that if total destruction ever happens, it will be caused by renegade smaller countries.  More importantly, his variation on the theme of everyone living lives of quiet desperation, but here with a terribly fixed time limit, was bone-chilling.  And it was the simplicity of the characters that made this book so poignant and thought provoking.  One of the top 10 books I've ever read.	2000-11-16

While typically complex, the mystery plot here  was at least understandable.  But, as always, the key to these novels is  the human plot introduced in the Vanished Child, and the denouement of that  plot here was just fantastic; it was truly a payoff for people who have  read all the books in the trilogy.  Hopefully, the author will reconsider  her decision to make this only a trilogy, and write one more episode set  during World War One.  The ending of this book certainly sets up the  possibility of such a sequel.  All in all, this was a great read, and  anyone who may have been slightly turned off of this series by The  Knowledge of Water should definitely give this book a try.	2000-08-23
