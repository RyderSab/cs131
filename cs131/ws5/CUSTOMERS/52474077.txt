Books	5	108	127	N	N	The Fundamental Philosophy of Wealth	Wayne Root is brash. He is obviously pondering a run in politics. The title annoys me. The standing on the car thing is goofy.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the book.<br /><br />Wayne Root gets it.<br /><br />Ownership. It's all about ownership and moving away from government dependence. Someone finally stands up and points out the obvious about privatized Social Security. There is no choice.<br /><br />Realism. Does Wayne Root tell you, \\"Oh it's so easy becoming a millionaire.....\\"??....no...that was all the other books. Root tells you the truth. It's hard work. It's really worth it. His early life story and rise to wealth resonate with my experience. Failure after failure and refusing to quit. Always doing what the average guy won't. He went for what he loved and he got it. That's real.<br /><br />Metaphor: His metaphor of taking 19 people out to lunch every week for the rest of your life and them expecting you to pay because you work hard and earn more money than they do...BECAUSE...you work smart and hard...is wonderful. It shows the clear divide between those who are in-dependent and those who feel they are entitled to eat off the plates of those who are independent.<br /><br />His discussion on taxes is well done. His analysis of the current political situation. (Crummy democratic candidates for President coming in the next few elections...vs. a generally better group of Conservative options including McCain and Rice.<br /><br />I'm a Libertarian. I'm sick of the whole Red Blue thing, but Root creates a powerful argument for moving to a Red state. More jobs are being created there, more people are moving to Red and from the Blue...<br /><br />He points out a fascinating statistic that 81% of all counties in America voted for Bush over Kerry. I'm not really much of a Bush fan, at least not in this second term, but clearly his arguments for the RESULTS of the last election are cogent.<br /><br />Overall, I could have lived without the title. It's irritating to someone like me who did just fine without having a party affiliation. Nevertheless, if you had to choose....<br /><br />Listen, give this book a read. It's passionate. He loves his work. He loves his wife. He loves his country.<br /><br />And I found the book to be persuasive.<br /><br />Kevin Hogan<br />Author of The Psychology of Persuasion<br />and<br />The Science of Influenceevertheless, if you had to choose....

And Weissman shows how.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and you come away with a real education in handling tough questions.<br /><br />The book delivers.<br /><br />Kevin Hogan<br /><br />Author of The Psychology of Persuasion<br /><br />and<br /><br />The Science of Influence	2005-08-05

The first 50 pages of Harper's book, put me to sleep and then it happened. I woke up with a bang!<br /><br />Harper addresses what I truly believe to be some of the most crucial factors in business success in his new book, The Ripple Effect.<br /><br />He shares with the reader some of the distinctions of how people think about the people they do business with.<br /><br />For example. Some people think in terms of \\"referrals.\\" Others in terms of \\"leads.\\" You know what I don't want anyone I know to be a \\"lead\\" for someone else. I want to refer my friends to the best people out there.<br /><br />Then Harper shows us the difference between the two types of networkres. Those who want the quick buck. Those who want a long term relationshiop. I'll take the relationship. How about you?<br /><br />He shares his thoughts about the talk/listen ratio. Lots of people talk more than they listen. They will die in business.<br /><br />Harper shows you how to network in a valuable and productive fashion and that is well worth the price of this book because the vast majority of people out there are terrible at networking and have little understanding about how what they do today will...or won't...make a difference to them long term.<br /><br />In this book Harper elucidates on all these critical factors.<br /><br />For years, I've worked hard at giving far more than I receive in business and in every aspect of my life. I think Steve's relationship depth model provides a good way to evaluate your relationships and see what your chances of long term success are.<br /><br />I really like this book. I'm recommending it to my friends and Coffee with Kevin Hogan readers.<br /><br />Kevin Hogan<br /><br />Author of The Psychology of Persuasion	2005-07-27

Adam Eason's work is thorough, clear. The book is well written, easy to read and one that you will be glad to have in your library. The book is a blueprint for self hypnosis. He starts you out with defining what each word means then moves along to all the basics like inductions. Then he shows you how to write new programs and so on.<br /><br />There are plenty of scripts and then lots of subjects that he covers in depth.

Easterling spent so much time building credibilty for his work that I nearly fell asleep. THEN when he started talking about the stock market, what factors really determine the long term prices and valuations of markets, well, that's when this book took off. Great stuff.<br /><br />Written for the non-technical reader but doesn't talk down. I thought the charting of various variables in stock market trends and tendencies to be very friendly to read. Easterling spent the time to literally do the graphs and charts in color and that was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />He doesn't claim to be a seer, he simply does a brilliant job of laying out piece by piece, how to calculate the future of the stock market.<br /><br />Truly well done and one of the top four or five investment/stock books of the year.<br /><br />When you read something this well done, you can only appreciate the author and his love, and depth of knowledge of his subject.<br /><br />Kevin Hogan, Psy.D.<br /><br />Author of The Psychology of Persuasion<br /><br />and<br /><br />The Science of Influence	2005-07-09

In a very kind way he shares with you that if you are 25 and follow the millionaire next door strategies you will indeed grow wealthy...and you will. But if you are 40...or 50 you haven't got a chance beginning with those strategies today.<br /><br />Masterson then eliminates the should be obvious but never is...fact that wealth doesn't happen on accident. You'll need to plan and do. (More rare human behavior)<br /><br />More good advice (it's all pretty much good advice in this book by the way) then he comes to the point. Do something that will make you rich. Doctor, dentist, engineer: You don't have to be in business. Pretty much everyone else needs to be in an entrepreneurial venture. And of course this is the only viable option for building wealth for the 40 plus who isn't one of those professions (or like them).<br /><br />He shares some useful tips about passive income and indeed that is WHERE it IS all at in wealth building. If you got it, you get it, if you don't...you are not doing it right.<br /><br />A really impressive primer on wealth building. I enjoyed it. I always pick up ideas from Masterson and I find him one of the sharpest minds in business.<br /><br />Kevin Hogan<br /><br />Author of The Science of Influence<br /><br />and<br /><br />The Psychology of Persuasion	2005-03-10

It's certainly one of the better books about building wealth and I think that everyone can benefit from it regardless of their current level of income.<br /><br />For $20 it's hard to ask for much more than the dozens of nuggets of wisdom you get and can use in real life.

You aren't. I consider Jeffrey Gitomer a good friend. That means he has tons of integrity, cares about people and is unwavering in his desire to give tons of value to everyone he meets. Sometimes he's tough as nails. Sometimes soft as a kitten. So with that in mind....<br /><br />Jeffrey Gitomer's new book is probably my favorite for a lot of reasons.<br /><br />First, let's talk about the content (isn't that all there is in a book?). He gives specific tips for how to brand yourself (something that I've written about having discovered the same things that Jeffrey has). It's must do stuff.<br /><br />He hammers on value. If the guy on the other end of the phone or conversation says anything but \\"yes!\\" the value hasn't been establish. The relationship hasn't been established.<br /><br />Then there is price. How important is it? How do you meet the price concerns? It's here.<br /><br />Maybe most important are his distinctions between success and failure in selling.<br /><br />So the content is excellent.<br /><br />Move to the book itself. It is beautiful. It combines a feel of a school book you may have had ...when you were very young. You open the book and it is FUN. I normally don't talk about illustrations....but they make the book instantly readable and memorable...and in this case that's an exciting part of the book because it brings you back and cements the messages of the book into your unconscious mind.<br /><br />Just flipping the pages gives you instant ideas on how to sell your products or services that Jeffrey probably never intended. The combination of a DIFFERENT feel to the book. Different layout. Everything. Just having the book literally on your desk gives you ideas that are useful.<br /><br />Maybe my subjectivity is overwhelming.<br /><br />The book itself is not profound. It is simply on target and designed at least unconsciously to bury salesmanship into the deepest parts of your mind.<br /><br />Kevin Hogan<br /><br />Author of The Psychology of Persuasiono the deepest parts of your mind. <br /> <br />Kevin Hogan <br />Author of The Psychology of Persuasion	2004-09-01

I read it at light speed. To say this book is an eye opener is an understatement. I travel a lot...but not this much! ...no one does!<br />I learned a great deal following the Jim, Paige, videographer and car around the world. I confess there is much of their journey I would never have had the guts to undertake and thus was impressed by some of their choices of travel.<br />Here's some of what you are going to pick up:<br />1) You're going to find out what countries to put a few shekels into and which one's not to. (There are a lot more to NOT.)<br />2) You're going to get an excellent idea of where you want to visit on your next non-5-star trip out of the country.<br />3) You're going to find out that Vancouver B.C. is overall one of the finest cities in the world. (I can't think of a better one myself.)<br />4) Some darn good arguments for unrestricted free trade and open borders.<br />5) Solid challenges to your way of looking at the political messes of virtually every nation on the planet and a few ideas on what could make things better.<br />6) Lots of ways to save your hard earned money.<br />7) The fact that there are precious few powerhouse opportunities right now.<br /><br />Of some interest, Jim notes he was told you can't buy a house in Australia if you don't live there. That's what I was told by some cab drivers, realtors and university prof's. Others told me the exact opposite and a few noted that you can't buy but you can build. Go figure. This is truly a bizarre phenomenon. Whatever the deal is, don't cut the check until you know the answer.<br />This book was a lot of fun. Thoroughly enjoyable and a lesson in looking at the world and the USA that sometimes is a bit stern.<br />Loved it.<br />Kevin Hogan<br />Author of The Psychology of Persuasion<br />[...]	2004-07-17

A world of war where there are no winners and very many losers. The young man Peter, has no life and is made a slave in Germany. The story is in part a search for himself and a search for the meaning in the world he finds himself him. The story is also of a group of Polish Resistance to the Germany that should never have been. It is a story of a little girl and the love she sees in Peter. It is also a not so subtle reminder of the world in which we live. 21st century slavery is reality in this work of fiction that overlaps with reality in so many places it makes you uncomfortable at times....The premise is that Hitler won. The German's have control of most of Europe and very little resistance from an ignorant America. Every assumption you have about slavery and servants, war and peace, love and hatred, values and beliefs will be challenged.<br />As you read the book, you begin to thank god that Hitler didn't win but then you have this haunting suspicion that there is still slavery and politically endorsed murder and genocide happening as you read (Kosovo, Yugoslavia, Africa, etc.)Your mind wanders to Milosevec and you realize this book is all too real. The lessons the author reveals are enormous.<br /> JN Stroyar is a passionate writer. Having spent time in Poland meeting real people as she has, I can attest to the spirit and the intensity with which she imbues her characters. This is truly a masterpiece. Children's War comes in at about 300,000 words and will take you about 40 hours to read. It may be the best time you have invested in reading in a long, long time. This book meets every expectation you could have in a dramatic sense.<br />If it were required reading in high school...it just might change the world.<br />Kevin Hogan, ...	2001-07-29

The story is sooooooo fantastic that you will have a hard time distinguishing reality and fantasy in this amazing work of fiction. This is easily one of my favorite books of all time. Iles paints brilliant characters who move quickly in an intricately woven plot. How does the &quot;evil spirit of Facism&quot; continue 40 years after the war is over? This book is convincing in it's presentation of this idea (and many other subtle and not so subtle political ideologies) that will have you thinking and rethinking your views of the current geopolitical scheme of the world. There is nothing negative to say about this book except that it ends... Absolutely brilliant.  Kevin Hogan, ...	2001-06-14

Dennett says, &quot;Darwin's dangerous idea is that Design can emerge from mere Order via an algorithmic process that makes no use of pre-existing Mind.&quot; I thought that was a pretty swaggering statement until I read his reasoning.

Instead, I liked it. I thought the core idea of viral violence was very stimulating. I think the obviously brilliant author simply took on too much. This would have made a better non-fiction speculative book but instead we got a bit of a story, which at times was quite good, wrapped around some very interesting ideas. The characters were often unbelievable. The main characters daughter, for example, doesn't talk like a little girl but a teenager. Still, through the annoyances, I finished the book and hope the author writes another and another. I'd recommend it but it's not a page turner. Best part: It encourages thinking and conversation about violence. Kevin Hogan, ...	2001-04-14

It would take a book to review this book. It's simply a must read for every human being on earth. The book doesn't begin in 1939 or even 1933. This book starts where it should, with the birth of Hitler's grandparents. Shirer takes you through generations then the life of the young man noting key points of Hitler's life that shape his personal evolution into becoming one of the most evil men ever to walk the earth. Shirer's first hand accounts are important as is the meticulous research he did. We owe an enormous debt to Shirer. This is one of my favorite books of all time. Kevin Hogan, ...	2001-04-14

If you want to understand huMAN nature, this is one of the fine starting points. The subject matter is incredibly controversial and he handles it very well.

Getting What You Want is a good read. Even when you completely disagree with Ringer, (his comments on Presley are from left field) you find you can't stop reading. This is a kinder and gentler Ringer but he still get's the basics across: He makes clear the value of being productive. It's time to quit whining and start doing. Clear yourself of the energy zappers from your life and develop self discipline so you don't blow it in life. This is an excellent read and I wholeheartedly recommend it. Kevin Hogan, ...	2001-01-31

The book is insightful for readers of (almost) all levels of education. Ratley takes the reader artfully through the processes of perception, attention and behavior. I rarely read a book written for a popular audience that is readable and accurate. While fulfilling the message of the book you also are treated to a clear understanding of how important perception is to each individual's life. You will begin to understand many problems people suffer from who do not have &quot;normal&quot; perception and what is being done to help those people. I really liked this book.

Cialdini's influence was enormously influential in my work in the field of persuasion and you can't say enough wonderful things about this text.

The depth of the book doesn't match say, The Beatles Anthology and it could have. It doesn't have the striking pictures that other books in the genre do. But let's not get to critical. Ernst Jorgensen has almost singlehandedly revitalized the music of Elvis into mainstream America and Guralnick, while not always perfect has presented an accurate image of Elvis. Many little things add interest to this book. These include the many photos of documents that Elvis signed. Also, some unreleased and rare photos.I could have suggested more quality photos and experiences from the 68-72 era. The day by day in these years could have been better chronicled, in my opinion.  I thought the picture of Elvis on stage live with Tom Jones was quite neat and worth the price of the book. Overall this book is excellent.

The science is weak and the conclusions Gladwell draws sometimes don't follow from the facts presented. So why 5 stars? Because this is one of the finest books on memetics ever written. His STYLE makes up for the flaws and then some. Gladwell doesn't use the words virus or meme in the book (at least I don't think he did) but that's what this book is about. Heck, there may not even BE a tipping point. But when you read this book you UNDERSTAND the phenomenon of viral marketing and memetics well enough to explain it to your 10 year old and that is rare. Most books written on the spread of ideas fail miserably at defining what memes are. This book simply tells the story so well there is never another doubt. Wonderful read. Kevin Hogan...	2001-01-14

The Global Brain is a monumental work and one that has instant application in the world. I can't say enough good about this book. The PROLOGUE has more useful information in it than most BOOKS do. The Chapter &quot;Reality is A Shared Hallucination&quot; is one of the finest discussions of what could be called &quot;social psychology&quot; that I have ever read.

Problems first: Blackmore jumps between science and speculation throughout the book and that was frustrating at times. I was not absolutely certain about the books identity as I read it. What was in it for me? I personally liked three specific parts of this book. 1) I really enjoyed the sections on evolutionary psychology and those related to sexual selection. Blackmore excels here and I felt like we were really moving! 2) Her arguments about altruism are compelling. 3) Her toying with the new agers was very fun. Now, should you own this book? You bet. Memetics is in it's infancy. From D.D. to R.B. we learn useful ideas that ultimately give us a better picture of the world we live in...and create everyday.	2001-01-14
