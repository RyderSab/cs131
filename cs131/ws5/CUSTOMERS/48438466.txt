As its hero struggles to bridge the gap between his own rational atheism and his fiance's Christian faith, he finds help from an old friend and former mentor, who opens his eyes to new worlds of spiritual thought. <br /> <br />This book is especially for people who have rejected God on scientific and rational grounds. It offers a spiritual perspective that is both rationally satisfying and spiritually penetrating. <br /> <br />James Spilling (1825-1897) was born and raised in Ipswich, England. He had a career as a bookseller, newspaper editor, writer, and publisher. <br /> <br />As a young man, Spilling was a political radical and a religious skeptic, inspired by the writings of Voltaire, Thomas Paine, and others. He co-founded a local freethinking association called the Ipswich Utilitarian Society. With a strong mind and a spirit for aggressive debating, he was only gradually won over to a full acceptance of the Christian philosophy of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772). Putting his well-honed verbal skills to good use, he then became an effective exponent of that spiritual perspective. <br /> <br />From this personal experience, Spilling outlined the narrative of The Evening and the Morning.	2005-04-28

Using the system of \\"correspondences,\\" or living symbolism taught by Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), the Swedish scientist, philosopher, and spiritual seer, the Rev. John Worcester explains the spiritual meaning of the various parts of the human body. <br /> <br />Worcester also introduces the concept of the \\"Greatest Man.\\" In traditonal Christian terminology this might be called the \\"body of Christ.\\" It is the idea that in function, humankind as a whole forms a \\"human body,\\" and the people in it serve spiritual functions analogous to the physical functions of the organs and members of the body to which they correspond.	2005-04-09

The Rev. John Clowes encountered Swedenborg's writings in 1773, just one year after Swedenborg died. Clowes--who was a young, recently ordained Anglican minister at the time--wholeheartedly accepted the new doctrines, and began preaching them at his (Anglican) Church in Whiteside, Manchester, England. This he continued to do throughout the rest of his long, sixty year pastorate at that church. Along the way, he translated many of Swedenborg's works into English, and produced many books and commentaries. <br /> <br />This commentary on the Gospel of Mark is not primarily Clowes's thought, but rather a gathering of passages from the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg explaining the spiritual meanings of the various passages in Mark's Gospel. However, Clowes also provides a very useful brief verse-by-verse summary of the spiritual meanings, with his own translation of the Gospel in one column and the explanation in the other. In addition, at the end of each chapter he provides translators' notes with insights on the language and meaning of various words and phrases is the Gospel.	2005-03-31

Wilson Van Dusen describes the mature mystic, enumerating the characteristics of those whose lives are shaped by the experience of God. He explains how religion fits within the context of culture and how mysticism fits--or does not--within the context of religion. He also compares the mystical to the aesthetic, noting the similar ways in which art and epiphany move and elevate the experiencer. <br /> <br />Believing that all have the potential to experience God, Van Dusen opens the mystical realm to the reader with his warm and accessible style. Writing from lifelong personal experience in the spiritual dimension, he offers a singular interpretation of the history of major religions and their regard for mysticism. <br /> <br />An especially useful chapter introduces a simple, effective practice with an icon to help us \\"shut off the whirl of events so we can come to experience our own center, which happens to be also the center of the universe.\\" <br /> <br />In every field, some books rise above the rest to become classics. Wilson Van Dusen's is such a book. He writes with refreshing clarity, even luminosity, knows the territory, defines his terms, and maps the mystical path for those awakening to the journey. <br />--Dan Millman <br />Author of The Laws of Spirit <br /> <br />Wilson Van Dusen, Ph.D., as chief psychologist at Mendocino State Hospital for many years, was praised for his work with the mentally ill using original methods involving spiritual concepts. Van Dusen was also instrumental in the creation of the acclaimed humanistic psychology department at Sonoma State University, the first such program at a traditional university. He is the author of The Country of Spirit: Selected Writings, The Presence of Other Worlds, The Natural Depth in Man, and Returning to the Source: The Way to Experience God.	2005-03-30

Originally published under the title Traum, Hallucination, Vison in Offene Tore, Swedenborg Verlag, Zurich, March, 1966. <br /> <br />From the Back Cover <br /> <br />In this objective study, one of the most able theologians of our time evaluates the phenomena of Dreams, Hallucinations, and Visions as recorded in the Bible, in the writings of mystics, and in scientific annals. He formulates rational explanations of the difference between the three types of phenomena, their psychic and religious significance, causes, effects, and their limitations. Although the author avoids medical or psychiatric aspects, concentrating on the religious, and specifically Christian experience, he does refer to chemically induced phenomena and consciousness-expanding drugs, as well as the historical role such phenomena have played in scientific discoveries. In this presentation he relates his analysis to a particular religious and scientific figure in the scope of whose experinec all three types are matters of record; namely, the scientist, philosopher, and theologian, Emanuel Swedenborg. <br /> <br />About the Author <br /> <br />Ernst Benz, of Friedrichshafen, Germany, was a noted Protestant theologian, director of the Ecumenical Institute, and Professor of Church History at the University of Marburg. His wide range of interests included the fields of church history and the history of Christian dogmatics. A prolific writer, his works on a number of the great Christian mystics, particularly Gioacchimo da Fiore and Emanuel Swedenborg, have won him wide recognition. This also holds true for his works on the Orthodox Church, and many other topics. It is no exaggeration to rank him among the most able theological scholars of our time.	2005-03-27

This most baffling and complex mechanism has long been the subject of speculation and scientific study. \\"Know thyself\\" is an ancient dictum attributed to Solon of Athens. And these very words were inscribed over the portico of the famed temple at Delphi. Certain it is that he who knows his mind knows himself. <br /> <br />We have still a great deal to learn about the processes that result in our conscious thoughts and emotions. When the mind seems to produce visions, voices, and hallucinations, we find ourselves groping for explanations. <br /> <br />Such symptoms commonly found in abnormal behavior are given a new, provocative, and profound analysis in this pamphlet by Dr. Wilson Van Dusen, psychologist. His conclusions, based on careful research, have radical implications for our self-understanding, and for the diagnosis and cure of many emotional disorders. <br /> <br /> <br />About the Author <br /> <br />Wilson Van Dusen is a self-taught student of Swedenborg's works. In some ways he considers this an advantage because he does not come to them with the biases of those in any of the major groups of followers, but rather has had to work out their meaning in his own life. His being a clinical psychologist, a mystic, and a student of all the major religions has also helped. It gives to his understanding of Swedenborg a startling freshness. <br /> <br />The breadth of his interests make him a little hard to pigeonhole. He holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and worked 20 years among the mentally ill where he developed self-help communities. He has other earned and honorary degrees in science and investment. He had another career at sea and holds an unlimited license as a captain. Presently he is in a busy retirement continuing to explore his burgeoning interests. His two books The Presence of Other Worlds (on Swedenborg) and The Natural Depth in Man (on inner states) were originally published by Harper & Row, N.Y., N.Y. and have been translated into several foreign languages. He has also published well over 100 articles on psychology and Swedenborg.	2005-03-26

The inner meanings of the commandments concerning the Tabernacle, the details of worship, and particularly the laws of sacrifice, are brought out through the author's use of Swedenborg's symbolism. By treating the commandments as psychological truths, the author shows us how they may be applied in our journeying today. <br /> <br />About the Author <br /> <br />Dr. Dorothea Harvey effectively combines her study and teaching of religion with the practical and personal power of religious symbolism, healing and mystical experience. Her ministry is one of concern for spiritual and personal growth. Many people have helped to create the material presented in this book by sharing their reactions and daily experiences, and have applied what they've learned about the power of the Old Testament to daily living. <br /> <br />Dr. Harvey has done extensive archeological study in the Near East and has a solid understanding of biblical stories and customs. Her knowledge of Hebrew and other Semitic languages complement well her interest in the Old Testament as it relates to her own life, as well as allowing her to speak with authority of its content and power. <br /> <br />Other publications by Dr. Harvey include works on the literary forms, the prophets, the forms of worship, and the women of the Old Testament. <br /> <br />Dr. Harvey is a 1943 graduate of Wellesley College. She earned her M.Div. at Union Theological Seminary and her doctorate in Literature of Religion at Columbia University. She has taught at Wellesley College, Milwaukee-Downer College and Lawrence University, and has been a professor of religion at Urbana College since 1968 and its chaplain since 1975. She is the minister of the Swedenborgian Church in Urbana, Ohio. <br /> <br />Additional Biographical Note <br /> <br />In 1975 Dorothea Harvey became the first woman to be ordained as a Swedenborgian minister.

It is to view some of the teachings of the Lord as they are found in the Gospels and in the writings of the New Church; and to look through these spiritual teachings, as through lenses, in the effort to visualize and make our own that heavenly life which they so vividly proclaim. Our hope is that you who read Where Heaven Begins will find yourself entering into its purpose, and into some real measure of its fulfillment. <br /> <br />Review <br /> <br />This is a book that belongs in every home. It deserves a reading by all who are seeking the Christian way of life. It is a wise and loving testimonial of a minister who knows from experience Where Heaven Begins. The reader need not be wary that he may be led on an uncomfortable \\"other worldly\\" excursion, for this little book makes it clear that if heaven does not begin in the human heart and mind right here on this plane of existence, it never will. <br /> <br />Introduction <br /> <br />His fellow churchmen and friends will prize having something more from Everett Bray's hand. His previous book, Why Do Things Happen? appeared as long ago as 1920. At that time Mr. Bray was the pastor of the New Church Society in St. Paul, Minn. He has served a steadily widened circle since then; he is minister at Cambridge, Mass., was for some years the President of Convention, is General Pastor of the Massachusetts Association, and more recently became President of the New Church Theological School, Cambridge. In the present book he offers counsel, then, out of an abundance of pastoral experience. He notes what a wealth of teaching the New Churchman has on all the realities of the Christian life. So rich is this teaching it can easily engross just our thinking, world without end! This wealth of teaching Mr. Bray treats not as an end in itself, but as an aid to the more abundant life--heaven's life. In fervent pastoral concern and in affectionate personal regard he urges upon us that our teachings are \\"gates of righteousness\\" through which we may enter a profounder Christian experience. <br /> <br />The unsigned poems are Mr. Bray's, and add to the value and interest this book will have for his many friends.	2005-03-12

There are two worlds--the spiritual world, where spirits and angels are, and the natural world, where men are <br />   2. The spiritual world existed and subsists from its own sun, and the natural world from its own sun <br />   3. The sun of the spiritual world is pure love, from Jehovah God, Who is in the midst of it <br />   4. From that sun proceeds heat and light, and the heat proceeding from it is in its essence love, and the light from it is in its essence wisdom <br />   5. Both the heat and the light flow into man--the heat into his will, where it produces the good of love, and the light into his understanding, where it produces the truth of wisdom <br />   6. Those two, namely, heat and light, or love and wisdom, flow conjointly from God into the soul of man, and through this into his mind, its affections and thoughts, and from these into the senses, speech, and actions of the body <br />   7. The sun of the natural world is pure fire, and by means of this sun the world of nature existed and subsists <br />   8. Therefore everything which proceeds from this sun, regarded in itself, is dead <br />   9. The spiritual clothes itself with the natural, as a man clothes himself with a garment <br />  10. Spiritual things, thus clothed in a man, enable him to live a rational and moral man, thus a spiritually natural man <br />  11. The reception of that influx is according to the state of love and wisdom in a man <br />  12. The understanding in a man can be elevated into the light, that is into the wisdom, in which the angels of heaven are, according to the improvement of his reason; and in like manner his will can be elevated into the heat of heaven, that is into love, according to the deeds of his life; but the love of the will is not elevated except so far as the man wills and doesthose things which the wisdom of the understanding teaches <br />  13. It is altogether otherwise with beasts <br />  14. There are three degrees in the spiritual world, and three degrees in the natural world, hitherto unknown, according to which all influx takes place <br />  15. Ends are in the first degree, causes in the second, and effects in the third <br />  16. From these things it is plain what is the quality of spiritual influx from its origin to its effects	2005-03-12

Various techniques developed by Frank Rose and Robert Maginel provide firm footholds for the ascent toward more meaningful relationships with God, self, and others. The reader clearly sees how to forgive, to release false cause, and to live in the present.\\" <br />--Paul H. Skinner, author of <br />Vision: The Search for a Spiritual Pathway <br /> <br />Frank Rose and Robert Maginel lead spiritual growth groups in which both the principles of Emanuel Swedenborg's theology and a twelve-step approach to overcoming unconscious behaviors are applied. Rose and Maginel, co-founders of the Arizona Spiritual Growth Foundation, guide people to nurture the spiritual dimension to make their lives more loving, peaceful, and effective. The Joy of Spiritual Growth, their first book, is a real-life primer for those starting out on the path of recovery. <br /> <br />Recognizing that spiritual growth can be stymied by materialism and external preoccupations, the authors supply tasks that can be used repeatedly to help \\"tame the wild beasts,\\" the negative emotions that can control our lives and destroy our relationships with others. <br /> <br />A special feature of the book is the \\"Reporting on the Task\\" section at the end of each of the twelve steps, in which participants who were enrolled in a twelve-week seminar, held in the fall of 1998, share their struggles in their own words. Their successes or setbacks in applying the tasks to daily life underscore the ongoing nature of the recovery process and remind us that the joy of spiritual growth is linked to enjoying the journey.	2005-03-12

It builds vocabulary, develops thoughts, and so opens up communication with others.\\" <br /> <br />Immediately a student asked: \\"What should we write about?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Anything at all,\\" said the professor. \\"It's not what you write, but how you say it. Every person has at least one original story--the story of himself. We are all individuals, so each story is unique.\\" <br /> <br />This is a marvelous part of human experience: we are each unduplicated, no two ever the same; and along with this fact is the less obvious but larger reality that a human being never ends. These two certainties express the meaning of personal life. <br /> <br />Scientists have taught that matter is indestructible; it changes frequently in form and function but never ceases to exist. God teaches that the human spirit, the soul to which matter relates itself, is forever; every soul, from the moment it enters the world as an individual, continues eternally to live. <br /> <br />It is imperative and wonderful to know that although physical equipment weakens and slows down, the spiritual self can keep right on growing and learning, developing and refining its immortal personality that began with being born. <br /> <br />This little book is about us--you and me and everyone. In discussing our inner lives, the feelings and thoughts which control all our outward activities, it tells a story without a plot but with a profound meaning: that individual build-ups of love and understanding are a person--and the person is forever. <br /> <br />This, then, is a story which never ends. <br /> <br />--Gwynne Dresser Mack <br /> <br />These discussions are compiled from the author's published writings and are based upon the studies of Emanuel Swedenborg and of modern research. <br /><br />Contents <br /> <br />    * Foreword <br />    * The New Horizon <br />    * What Are We? <br />    * Human Relations <br />    * The Greatest Need <br />    * Never Take For Granted <br />    * Light Along The Horizon	2005-03-12

I'm following an orchardman, Johnny Appleseed, through the fall forests. Johnny says that we're heading for Mansfield, Ohio, and that the year is 1812. I can't remember anything before Johnny rescued me from the Painted Men. But while traveling Johnny's trail, among woods and wolves and brambles and bears, I get to know about myself, with the help of Johnny and his books by Swedenborg. <br /> <br />My author, Anne Eliot Crompton, found Johnny Appleseed's story in real history. She has written other books about historical folk called The Ice Trail and The Lifting Stone, which I will read as soon as I can. She lives on a small farm back east in Massachusetts, and is married and has five grown children. <br /> <br />Author's Note <br /> <br />This story is almost true. Johnny really lived in Ohio in 1812, and his legend says he did most of the things mentioned in this book. The other people in the story are fictional characters, but they are very like the folk Johnny really knew. Because their talk is somewhat different from ours, there is a glossary of words and phrases at the back of this book. Brief biographies of Johnny (John Chapman) and his inspiration, Emanuel Swedenborg, can also be found at the back of this book.	2005-03-12

He asserts that biblical prophecies must be read on a symbolic level to understand their true or internal meaning. . . . This short work offers hope for the continuation of life on earth, the triumph of good, and eternal salvation. By understanding the universal application of his visionary insights, readers from other spiritual traditions can appreciate Swedenborg's writings for the truth they convey. <br /> <br />Emanuel Swedenborg, 1688-1772, was a remarkable visionary. A member of the Swedish Parliament, he was known throughout Europe as a scientist, inventor, and prolific writer. He is best known, however, for his extensive theological writings that fill thirty volumes, in which this work is included. Among other subjects, he wrote of the symbolic meaning of the Bible, spiritual symbols in the physical world (correspondences), a life of service and personal responsibility, and heaven and hell. <br /> <br />Contents <br /> <br />    * The Destruction of the World is not meant by the Day of the Final Judgment <br />    * The Procreations of the Human Race on the Earths will never Cease <br />    * Heaven and Hell are from the Human Race <br />    * All who have ever been born men from the Beginning of Creation, and are deceased, are either in Heaven or in Hell <br />    * The Final Judgment must be where all are together, thus in the Spiritual World, and not on Earth <br />    * The Final Judgment takes Place when the End of theChurch is come, and the End of the Church is when there is no Faith, because there is no Charity <br />    * All Things Predicted in the Apocalypse are at this day fulfilled <br />    * The Final Jugment has been Accomplished <br />    * Babylon and its Destruction <br />    * The Former Heaven and its Abolishment <br />    * The State of the World and of the Church hereafter <br />    * Index	2005-03-12

By providing extensive excerpts from Swedenborg's works and drawing parallels between his visionary insights and the works of philosophers and physicists such as David Bohm, Fritjof Capra, Rupert Sheldrake, and Albert Einstein, Groll shows how Swedenborg's voyage of discovery led him increasingly from the great to the small, from the outer to the inner, until he discovered the mirror of the universe, the seat of the Divine as the source of truth. <br /> <br />David Lorimer, director of the Scientific and Medical Network, provides a foreword that stresses Swedenborg's early preoccupation with wholeness and morphogenesis: \\"Swedenborg emerges as a holist before the term was coined.\\" Readers interested in holistic science and spirituality will appreciate this introduction to Swedenborg's works. <br /> <br />Ursula Groll was born in Germany and lived in Sweden for many years, where she worked at the Goethe-Institut.

Forty-six variations on the theme: how to react to the conditions of life on earth in such a way as to prepare oneself for life in the Kingdom of Heaven	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Author's Preface	When my grandfather died in the early twenties, a number of his books were dumped upon our household, including a leather bound set of the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Though I was only in my teens, these old tomes fascinated me, at first for their antiquarian interest, but afterwards because of the extraordinary nature of their contents. <br /> <br />Swedenborg (who was born in Stockholm in 1688 and died in London in 1772) claimed that during the last twenty-eight years of his life he had had his inner consciousness opened by the Lord into the Spiritual World, so that he could live with angels and spirits like one of them, visiting with them in their homes, conversing with them, and sharing their love and wisdom to a very high degree. <br /> <br />I discussed the matter excitedly with my father, and we concluded that, since there was no hint of insanity in these works, here was obviously a case of \\"either--or.\\" Either Swedenborg's claims were basically true (even literally true) or he must have possessed the most vivid imagination of anyone who had ever lived! Now, according to my reading, Swedenborg had in all other areas a rather prosaic imagination. He was conspicuous as a trained observer in the scientific field, with monumental works to his credit in mineralogy, cosmology, anatomy, and physiology, which displayed a marvelous power of inductive reasoning from empirical data, but little if any of the kind of creative imagination which one associates with Dante, Milton, or Blake. <br /> <br />As I read on, I became more and more convinced of the value of these formidable volumes. In fact, they changed the course of my thinking and of my life, leading me in the end to enter the ministry of the \\"Church of the New Jerusalem\\" or \\"New Church\\" which bases its beliefs on Swedenborg's theological and philosophical works. <br /> <br />My object in writing \\"For Heaven's Sake!\\" has not been specifically to promulgate Swedenborg's doctrines, although the insights the book contains have been developed within the framework of his theological system. My sole purpose has been to help the reader in his spiritual growth. I have therefore drawn very largely on my own forty years' experience as a pastor, in England, South Africa, and the U.S.A. Each chapter is complete in itself, and can be read separately, as for instance when you are in bed before dropping off to sleep; but there is a general sequence of thought throughout the whole book. I have not hesitated to repeat the main points over and over again, to drive them home; in fact, the volume could be regarded as \\"forty-six variations on a theme,\\" the theme being: How to react to the conditions of life on earth, in such a way as to prepare oneself for life in the Kingdom of Heaven.	2005-03-12

And if there is, what will become of me? <br /> <br />In the eighteenth century, a very capable man named Emanuel Swedenborg wrote that with God's help he had been having extensive experience of the life that awaits us all; and in a book called Heaven and Hell, he summarized several years of that experience. It prompted Elizabeth Barrett Browning to say, \\"To my mind, the only light that has been cast on the other life is found in Swedenborg's philosophy.\\" <br /> <br />In this volume, Bruce Henderson, from a lifelong familiarity with that philosophy, describes Swedenborg's findings in everyday, contemporary language. \\"The other life\\" emerges as the life we have already begun--this book is not simply about the future, but about the present. <br /> <br />Contents <br /> <br />    Introduction <br /> <br />   1.

In some ways he considers this an advantage because he does not come to them with the biases of those in any of the major groups of followers, but rather has had to work out their meaning in his own life. His being a clinical psychologist, a mystic, and a student of all the major religions has also helped. It gives to his understanding of Swedenborg a startling freshness. He has spent some years working out how Swedenborg's writings may be used in personal and spiritual development and this pamphlet is just part of that effort. <br /> <br />The breadth of his interests make him a little hard to pigeonhole. He holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and worked 20 years among the mentally ill where he developed self-help communities. He has other earned and honorary degrees in science and investment. He had another career at sea and holds an unlimited license as a captain. Presently he is in a busy retirement continuing to explore his burgeoning interests. His two books The Presence of Other Worlds (on Swedenborg) and The Natural Depth in Man (on inner states) were originally published by Harper & Row, N.Y., N.Y. and have been translated into several foreign languages. He has also published well over 100 articles on psychology and Swedenborg. He feels that Swedenborg's real contributions are as yet poorly understood by scholars, and indeed the simple person, who tries to apply them to life, is often ahead of the scholars.	2005-03-08

It is not hard to see why: We all would like to solve the mystery of what happens after physical death. Do we continue to live? And if so, what will our experience be like?<br />Swedenborg offers a beautiful, sensible, and believable picture of life after death. First, life does continue after physical death--in fact, our existence never ends. Swedenborg shows that heaven and hell are not places so much as states of being. And we learn that God does not send anyone to either heaven of hell, but that we live in complete freedom to choose and create the life we want to have. The material herein is taken from Swedenborg's classic, Heaven and Hell.<br />&quot;The most remarkable step in the religious history of recent ages is that made by the genius of Swedenborg. . . . Swedenborg is one of the missoriums and mastodons of literature, not to be measured by whole colleges of ordinary scholars: a colossal soul who lies vast upon our times and requires a long focal distance to be seen.&quot; --Ralph Waldo Emerson<br />Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) occupies a unique place in the history of Western philosophy and religion. Never has there been a man so equally acclaimed and at home in both science and religion. His personal story of the pursuit of truth led into experiences and realms for which he had never bargained.

Originally published in eight Latin volumes 1749-56, it has been translated into dozens of languages around the world.<br />In Arcana Coelestia Swedenborg first introduces the concept of &quot;correspondences&quot;: a living, spiritual meaning within Scripture. He then proceeds to offer a verse by verse spiritual interpretation of the books of Genesis and Exodus. Along the way, he explains the spiritual meaning of many parallel passages throughout the rest of the Bible.<br />If you have found the literalism of traditional Christian interpretations of the Bible to be unsatisfying and problematical, Swedenborg's spiritual interpretation will provide a whole new light on God's Holy Word. The Creation story of Genesis 1, for example, Swedenborg explains as relating, not to the literal creation of the physical universe, which we now know to have come into being over billions of years, but to the spiritual rebirth of human beings--the lifelong, step-by-step process of our being re-created &quot;in the image and likeness of God&quot; (Genesis 1:26, 27).<br />In between the chapters, Swedenborg provides essays on many spiritual topics, including:<br /> * The process of dying<BR> * Heaven and hell<BR> * The Last Judgment<BR> * The nature of the Bible<BR> * Human free will<BR> * The Grand Man (Universal Human)<BR> * The spiritual basis of disease<BR> * The interaction between the soul and the body<BR> * Divine Providence<BR> * The presence of angels and spirits with humans<BR> * Teachings about charity<BR> * Philosophy of creation<BR> * Inhabitants of other worlds<BR> * Marriage Love<br />Virtually every topic Swedenborg covers in his later works is introduced and discussed--often in great detail--in Arcana Coelestia.

Henry Maclagan. London: James Speirs, 1913.<BR>This book has long been out of print and very hard to find. Now, thankfully, it is available again in a photo reprint of the original 1913 edition.<BR>MacLagan wrote four solid volumes providing spiritual interpretations of the books of Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and the two books of Kings. (Emanuel Swedenborg himself had interpreted the books of Genesis and Exodus in his eight volume Latin work _Arcana Coelestia_, so Maclagan continued where Swedenborg left off.)<BR>In this volume, Maclagan interprets the book of Numbers as a parable telling the story of our inner, spiritual life and rebirth, using the method of &quot;correspondences,&quot; or living spiritual symbolism, explained by Swedenborg in his theological writings.<BR>For each chapter, MacLagan first provides a brief summary of the spiritual sense of the chapter. He then gives a spiritual meaning for each verse, in two-column format with the Bible verses (Revised Version) on the left and the spiritual interpretation on the right. Next comes a detailed section of references to places in Swedenborg's works where themes in each verse are explained. Finally, MacLagan provides a section of notes on the application of the chapter to our own individual &quot;regeneration,&quot; or spiritual rebirth process.<BR>To my knowledge, this is the only interpretation of the book of Numbers ever written from a Swedenborgian spiritual perspective. As such, it is a highly valuable book for anyone interested in the deeper meanings to be found in the Word of God. While the language is a bit dated (this book having been originally published in 1913), the serious Bible student will find a rich trove of material here.<BR>Maclagan's works are very rare now, and nearly impossible to find in their original editions. I am delighted to see his work on Numbers available again, and hope that the other volumes will soon become available also.<BR>Highly recommended!	2003-05-24

Its author, Signe Toksvig, who is not a Swedenborgian, focuses on Swedenborg's mystical and paranormal experiences. Though it contains some inaccuracies (for example, Swedenborg did not write his books by automatic writing), and should not be used as a primary biography of Swedenborg, it is otherwise well-written and very enjoyable to read. The introduction by the Rev. Brian Kingslake gives a balanced view of this book from a Swedenborgian perspective.	2003-02-21

It gives brief spiritual &quot;definitions&quot; of each word or phrase listed, and references to places in Swedenborg's writings where these definitions are found. It is a great dictionary-style reference for Bible studies in the light of Swedenborg's spiritual interpretations.	2003-02-21
