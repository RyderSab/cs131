The Sri Guru Granth Sahib just can't compare to the Gita or other more well-known  Indian scriptures. The book shows quite well what is meant by Bhakti-yoga,  but few westerners will be impressed and few Punjabis will need it. Still,  he has performed a valuable service by translating one of the world's minor  religious classics into English.	1999-11-17

The book is well documented and  fascinating and puts forth some theories as to what may be at the root of  the Grey Man phenomenon. Affelck Grey doesn not try to force anything on  the reader but allows the reader to form his or her own opinion as to the  matter. he is also not overly gullible and has no qualms about poking fun  at himself as he does in several personal anecdotes. The main faults of the  book are a fairly dull literary style, which makes the book slow reading as  well as a large number of Scotttish terms whihc makes it hard for non-Scots  to follow.

The emphasis here is not on the history of India, but on the relevance of Hinduism and Hindu  ideas for today's seeker. This book is not for the narrow-minded, as it is  one of  a series that utilizes every facet of the world's wisdom. It uses  meditation to show the existence of Atman or as Husserl had it, the  &quot;transcendental ego&quot;. The living experience of life is shown as  taking precedence over theory and the true value of Hindu thought is  revealed here. A must for all interested in genuine wisdom as opposed to  mythology.	1999-09-20

Prabhupada tries to identify Krsna with Christ and tries to come across as  being the foremost proponent of 'the science of self realization' rather  than a member of some sectarian cult. He denies that the labels of 'Hindu',  'Christian' or 'Muslim' are of any use to those who are not devoted to god.  But he over and over again seems to emphasize the Hindu scriptures and  holds that they must be taken literally. His basic theological arguments is  basically the same as that of all other fundamentalists: 'if you disagree  with my interpretation of the books that I consider holy and  divinely-inspired, then you are a fool and a heathen'. Even so, some of his  conversations with Christian leaders is thought-provoking. The emphasis  that ISKCON places on vegetarianism, celibacy and chanting is gone over in  detail, but the outsider is more likely to feel that he or she has been  wise to keep away from the movement. Prabhupada doesn't tend to listen to  anyone who disagrees with him even when his logic is poor -- he will often  not allow them to finish their train of thought and refers to his opponents  over and over again as 'fools', even going as far as to deny that Sancarya  believed in god and to say that all non-Bhakti yogis will not receive  salvation despite the position of the advaita school of the Vedanta. But he  does say something in some of the interviews about his background as a  husband, father, and profession as a chemist before becoming a sanyasi,  which idealises the idea of non-attached work encouraged in the  Bhagavad-Gita.	1999-09-15

The book contains not only a Salieri biography, but a detailed  history of the opera in to Salieri's day and rightly regards him as the  successor of Gluck's reform operas. The major fault of the book is that it  will appeal mainly to musicians and musical historians rather than the  general reader due to its over-technical nature with regard to some areas.

One could almost call these stories a series of extended prose poems; the scenes of Bengali life are painted with full force. The situations are not very realistic, but the  realism of emotion is all the more genuine because of it. The one complaint  I have is that every single story turns out bad! There is not a single  happy story in the book, which makes Tagore seem like so much of a  pessimist. The stories are also not really stories in the western sense --  they are more properly called &quot;tales&quot;, with a minimum of action  and a sense of being &quot;told&quot; a story rather than experiencing it  as it unfolds.	1999-07-06

They are about the experience of living between cultures, and all of the difficulties and rewards that go along with it. The book forms a tapestry  of experience to such an extent that it forms a complete impression upon  the reader as a whole -- not from the consideration of any one verse. So at  first the verse are not impressive, but with repeated readings, the  individual parts come together to form a cohesive whole in such a way that  a single poem couldn't express, so it is understandable why Ms. Vazirani  egards it as her first novel -- it conveys much the same impression as a  well-written story would. Most of all, there is little or no feeling of  regret or loss or a &quot;feel sorry for me&quot; ethic (something of a  rarity in modern poetry) in being a part of two widely differing cultures  -- a feeling of enrichment is conveyed instead -- a type of enrichment that  cannot be gathered by living in a narrow little corner of one's own. These  verses, by the way, will not only be understood by travellers, but also by  &quot;outsiders&quot; of all ilks, to use Colin Wilson's phrase. A most  impressive collection. With any luck, Vazirani will be publishing more of  her poetry in the very near future.	1999-06-22

There is a weak-willed, ineffectual woman who is in a relationship that turns sour and  she feels sorry for herself. End of story. There is not one story with a  happy ending, nor a single story of a strong, determined woman who is not  willing to put her foot down and not allow herself to be the victim of  circumstance and tradition. If this is how all Indian women are, its no  wonder they don't command respect, and I can't honestly believe that they  are all so pathetic. Just one story with a woman who really beleives in  herself would have been so refreshing. In a way, it forms a sort of  propaganda, much in the manner of D.H. Lawrence, Graham Greene or Jean-Paul  Sartre -- all of whom tend to accentuate only the negative aspects of  existence, then assume that there is nothing else. The exclusive emphasis  on the personal world of the individuals involved as well as on  relationships tends to make the whole book reek of self-pity. No women here  are interested in religion, in the larger world around them -- only in  their relationship to a jerk whom they would dump without compunction if  they had an ounce of self-repsect. The constant theme of ladies in a rotten  circumstance also seems after a while that the author is trying to preach  morality to people while wallowing in misery herself; this gets annoying  after a while. Even so, there IS a message to be had here about society and  relationships, as well as the hardships of adjusting to a new culture and  environment, and undoubtedly many women will be able to relate to the  stories.	1999-06-21

Could be used for a few  evenings of fun by some imaginative people, but not much else. Die  Elektrischen Vorspiele should not be attempted by those who have no  experience in high-voltage electrical theory. A bibilography would have  been appreciated, although not in keeping with LaVey's habit of using other  people's ideas (Crowley, Aquino, Lovecraft, Nietzsche, Reich, Rose, etc.)  and claiming them as his own. Crowley was more original. The introduction  is informative, however, and a &quot;Satanic Baptism&quot; ritual may  inspire people to develop more personal ceremonies for any special  occasion. The historical research is doubtful, but thought-provoking. If  you're under the delusion that you're &quot;superior&quot; like most  Satanists seem to be, this book will just strengthen your belief, but it's  definitely not for the sophistocated.	1999-06-16

A more personal approach than his other books, it's also far too narcissistic and whiny to make much impression on most except for  self-righteous Christians or know-it-all LaVey worshippers, although  amusing in places. LaVey seems to think that by whining about how much he  hates everyone he is indulging himself; I agree, but it is the  self-indulgence of a spoilt brat throwing a temper tantrum. A volume on his  work in lion-taming or psychic investigation would have been much more  impressive. The Satanic Bible is better in every way.	1999-06-16

He includes a bibliography for further reading and the book is written in a more scholarly manner than his other books. Much in here is  good advice -- such as females learning to use their natural charms to  their own advantage -- but the emphasis is misplaced and too many of  LaVey's own fetishes, which may not be shared by everyone, come out. He  prefers females in dresses and high-heels, whereas many men don't. Also,  the emphasis on controlling others is rather dull. The person who is really  &quot;superior&quot; to use LaVey's favourite term, is struggling to master  themselves, and would not bother worrying so much on how to impress or  control other people. And if any of you reading this are &quot;true&quot;  Satanists, you should be too busy writing symphonies or painting  masterpieces to bother with trite stuff like this.	1999-06-16

It's more entertaining than the prequel, &quot;Ritual In The Dark&quot;, but the philosophy is still a bit weak here. The theme of the book is this bloke (obviously based  on Albert Camus) who is trying to acheive metaphysical enlightenment  through sexual experience. The &quot;illusion&quot; aspect of sexuality is  a major themeas is Wilson's hobby horse, the theme of the &quot;narrowness  of human consciousness&quot;. Even so, the major interest of the book lies  in the person of Caradoc Cunningham, a practically undisguised replica of  the occultist Aleister Crowley. This is the only book that I have ever read  which seemed to give a balanced biew of hos personality, neither demonizing  him nor elevating him to the status of a god.

I generally dislike &quot;modern&quot; poetry, but these poems were different. They seemed to speak of things in a way that sounded very genuine. The major fault of the book was that all of  the poems seemed to emphasise how hard and terrible women's lives were,  usually as the result of actions by men. This is fair enough, but when ALL  of the poems seemed to have this same theme, it began to sound more like a  collection of ehining rather than genuine emotional expression.

Before taking the contents of this book too seriously, please watch &quot;An Element of the Divine&quot; -- the episode of &quot;Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers&quot; that deals with dowsing. In it,  Randi conducts an experiment which &quot;proves&quot; that dowsing is  &quot;bunk&quot;. Until, that is, Arthur C. Clarke stepped in and showed  him his error -- Clarke, the inventor of the communications satellite,  showed that Randi had erred in his analysis -- the probability against the  dowsers achieving the score they did was roughly one-hundred to one. How  seriously can you take such a man? Even when experiments do show evidence  for the paranormal they are ignored. This book is very informative and  entertaining, but should not be taken too seriously before weighing all of  the facts on BOTH sides of the argument. The biggest putoff is that Randi  seems to be so positive of himself -- there is never the slightest doubt  that he could be mistaken about anything he does.

The inconsistencies are not ignored but addressed directly and  after a reading of this book, the religion seems a great deal more valid  than I had understood it to be.  The authors personal opinions do come out  in several places, but as Hinduism is not an organised religion and because  of the vastness of its scope, this is unavoidable.

US	52679925	R1D3VMRQLGWKXW	0140445838	836529000	The Kural (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A Classic of Tamil Literature	This set of approximately 1300 couplets is divided into three subcategories: Virtue, wealth and love. It gives plenty of advice in the Hindu and Jain tradition, not of asceticism, but of one who is active in  the world, but wishes to be a good person and to have a good practical  understanding of his or her faith. The poetry is simple but effective.   Valluvar is on par with Valmiki in my opinion -- the reader of this short  little book (167 pages) will come to learn that Tamil is juat as important  a source of religious ideas as is Sanskrit and it is in use even today. A  must-read for all seekers.	1999-01-19

Only a few Upanisads are included, with mere excerpts from the longer ones, but it is still well worth anyone's time. Personal union with all of being  is the central theme, which will come as a welcome change from the more  presriptory religious teachings of the Vedas and Hebrew Bible.	1999-01-15
US	52679925	R3H3OQLVDBSEPE	0553211447	735273407	Notes From Underground	Books	3	1	5	N	N	Psychologically Compelling	Dostoevsky should have been a psychologist. The author sees very penetratingly into the heart of human emotions. Any &quot;outsider&quot; should read this book. The major fault is that the main character is not so  much misunderstood as a jackass. The reader will have a hard time relating  to him -- I was left with the feeling that his misery was of his own  creation and that he was so unpleasant as to deserve his misfortune. Even  so, this is a must-read for all those interested in existential literature.	1999-01-15

The conversation between the warrior Arjuna and his cousin and charioteer, Lord Krns, on the batlefield of Kuruksetra, demonstrates the essence of the Vedic spirit. The sense of spiritual  intoxication is enchanting, but unlike other Upanisads, however, too much  emohasis is placed upon obedience to authority and there are many  theological inconsistencies in the text. Despite the more enlightened  aspects of Krsna's advice, one cannot forget that it he he who is trying to  convince Arjuna to go out and kill his friends and relatives on a  battlefield when Arjuna himself is overcome with compassion for his fellow  human beings.	1999-01-15

Books	4	3	5	N	N	Not Totally Faithful, But A Wondeful Story	In this &quot;retelling&quot; of the Ramayana, one of the two most important epics of ancient India, Menen takes many liberties with the text -- he omits some episodes and adds others of his own making which he thinks  reflects the &quot;spirit&quot; of Valmiki, the poem's author. In this I  think he is successful and this is what makes this little prose version  such a pleasure to read. But anyone who is interested in a more scholarly  appraoch had  better look elsewhere. A great introduction to Indian  literature, especially for children. Roughly 270 pages.	1999-01-08

I was tempted to just ignore much of it and would  have, but for the numerous detailed and well0documented cases of  poltergeist hauntings that Wilson supplies. He eventually comes to the  conclusion that Poltergeists are either elemental spirits or spirits of the  dead and not merely the results of the unconscious mind of the the focus.  It's still a bit hard to swallow (for example, when he suggests talking  nicely to a stone that is going to be removed to appease the elemental  spirits residing in it), but the whole account is so level headed that it  is hard not to be convinced. Good for those interested in the subject, but  not one of Wilson's more imressive books.	1998-11-24
