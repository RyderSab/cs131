I rushed to buy it after Oprah recommended it so highly. I started reading it and wondered what happened to that book she was so excited about. I just didn't get it. I didn't care about any of the characters and I never got involved in the story, nor was I able to really follow it so well. I guess I just didn't care..because I gave up after about 125 pages, which is something I rarely do. Maybe I will try it again one day, but for now there are too many other books.	2001-12-13

I waited for it to be unbearable but it never got bad. It was sad and depressing but that's how life can be for many. I think any book can give a message and the one I got from this book is a reminder of how far-reaching abusive living situations can be. I was also reminded of a time not long ago when women truly had no options or choices, once marriage was entered into. <BR>It is sad to think many women wouldn't have taken their children and left the situation. Many are living this way today.	2001-10-02
US	50957059	R1HUSRDECXV2NM	0671510053	357229344	The Shipping News	Books	4	3	3	N	N	about something	A lot of reviews said this book wasn't about anything. It was definately about something....maybe not something much or something exciting, but about a style of living, a way of life, a dynamic of an area, and how life kinda just happens and rolls along this way and then that way without much guidance.  Quoyle deals with what comes up...he hopes for what he wants and takes what he gets.  The writing style was extremely refreshing and enjoyable as well as the imagery.  Good luck Quoyle and kids....you'll need it, but I know you'll manage.	2001-09-22

Examples are helpful and the language is very clear and unintimidating. Very friendly. I will probably hang on to this one as a reference for a few years.	2001-09-10

Congdon and just wrote the story from articles and interviews. It would have been a better telling with a little psychology....there was no mention of her upbringing or really of anyone's real personality. The whole thing was a bit cold I guess. It was interesting to see at the end that M. Congdon's name may be in the news soon...............	2001-08-27

I would have like to have seen more photos in the book...of anything to give more of a cultural feeling of Morrocco having never been there. I also thought the writing was a little cut and dried and many interesting facts were left out which could have made the writing richer and then at the end ...it just ended. I feel like I read half a book.	2001-08-27

I didn't end up feeling like I knew them at all. I felt like they were sleepwalking through their whole lives.  I don't hold out much hope for them. In short, the tale was not very interesting or believable. I didn't relate to it at all.	2001-07-24

Dig the names of the main players....Bubba Fluck (nicknamed Butt Fluck....yes...seriously!)Smudge (BF's friend), Smoke (gang leader), Weed(secret genius disguised as typical neglected kid), Dog, Sick, Divinity, Pigeon?  And then the police officers....Hammer, West, Brazil....and what about the 2 lady cop's pets and the human qualities they took on? I couldn't quite figure out if this story was tongue in cheek or finger in throat.  Anyway, the story just barely scraped together at the last chapter.....and then there were still frayed edges. I would say if you haven't started this book, move on....	2001-06-28

It was a good story and the end had a little twist. Not remarkable in my opinon, but ok for a read and I learned some things about midwifery.  If you have it laying around or if someone has it to loan you....go ahead, but as far as buying the book and expecting greatness...maybe not.	2001-05-26

I certainly get this artform and love it.  I ran across this book today in a little store on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. I had not heard of this artist before and while looking through some of his artworks, noticed the book which I had to have after page 1.  I started looking at the the book and know I will eventually collect all of Brian Andreas' work.	2001-03-24

Over and over I get it. Maybe I am being too harsh..I am just saying..the message was repetetive.  I felt the only reason for changing characters was to deliver the message again.  I listened to this book on tape and found myself zoning out a little, so I can't imagine reading the book. I did learn a few things, but feel a little beat over the head.	2001-03-02

I read Wally Lamb's &quot;She's come undone&quot; and thought hmmmm..it was OK. When Oprah recommended this one for her book club I decided to give Mr. Lamb another try because I really like big books and because it's so hard for me to resist Oprah's recommendations (so enthusiastic). This book just keeps coming and coming.  How DO people make this stuff up? Every page was worth the effort!	2001-01-26

I listened to this book on tape and enjoyed it.  I am not so sure I would have liked reading it as much. There seemed to be a lot of times I was thinking &quot;come on already, is something else going to happen here or what?&quot; I had some trouble with the timing. It seemed like Chief and (the assumed)Molina were really getting a lot of things done in like...2 days. Anyway..it's worth a listen if you find it for rent somewhere.	2001-01-24

It is a great vacation book if you plan to spend a lot of time reading.  I have finished all four of the books in this series and I cant believe how the author just keeps coming up with more and more stuff and it's all interesting! It's great the way she allows her imagination to merrily roll along. I have taken &quot;time off&quot; to read other books in between these four &quot;fatties&quot; but it's great to keep coming back to check up on Claire and Jamie!	2001-01-15

I kept thinking I was missing something. Did this woman (main character) who was going through a divorce and being much harrassed by the local police (having a glovebox filled with citations), a teenage son and cash flow problems really just show up at a hospital and walk out with a wolfman who asked her to take him home? Then she sets him up in her guest room and teaches him to read by leaving books with him and a few pages later he is so transformed as to be her guest at a friend's barbeque! Too many holes and leaps of faith for me.	2001-01-11

I think this book is very easy to understand and there are several modes used to clarify the same information as not everyone learns the same way.  Some are word oriented, some pictures, some graphs, etc..this textbook is impressive in this regard. I really like the clinical applications! I was dissapointed by the CD and really found it a waste of time so I have only used it one time..I just regard it as a freebie like a fancy bookmark.  The accompanying lab manual is beneficial as it covers much of the same material but in non-repetetive ways. I will probably keep this book as a reference as opposed to selling it back when the course is done.	2001-01-03

Then I got the book and struggled through it praying it would get better but it never did and by the end of the book I was sure I had ordered the totally wrong book, but no. It was the right book, just not the right book for me. I just didn't get it and never warmed up to any of the characters.  I cannot imagine why it was rated so highly by Oprah.	2000-12-20

Let me tell you how I felt after I finished this book. Exhausted! Melancholy! I needed a nap! I further felt like exploring more of the history of the Congo. I was a child who's knowledge of anything to do with the Congo was limited to the pictures in National Geographic. I have been exploring other mediums of history on the Congo since I put this book down. I bet you will too!  What else can I say?  Read this book! It will enrich your life!	2000-11-07

I loved the trip through this book, the words, the feel, all of it.  It's one of those books you don't read particularly for the power of the message but for the pleasure of being given passage through someone's memory. Although the story reminded me of the way people parent so irresponsibly, it sure does happen so frequently. Bittersweet tale!	2000-09-27

Get this book of daily affirmations and never let it out of your car! Yes, I'm serious.  If you are a parent, you know about all the 5 minute intervals you spend waiting... Am I right? There is no easier, quicker or more direct way to change your attitude toward the gift that is your child or the challenge that is your parenting. This is an investment in your parent/child relationship. It is worth the purchase price if it changes your relationship with your child and enriches your lives for just one day. Also a great stocking stuffer and/or baby shower gift!	2000-09-27
