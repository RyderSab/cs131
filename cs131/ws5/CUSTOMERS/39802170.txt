He states that pop culture in many ways is connected, and proceeds to attempt several essays which each relate an appreciation of what most people would kindly refer to as \\"crap\\". Sometimes this reliance on pop culture references can be too cute for its own good, and there will be some moments when you wonder why Mr. Klosterman is not currently residing in a mental ward.<br /><br />Things get off to a promising start, with an examination of why real relationships cannot live up to the fictional representation of such films as \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"Say Anything\\". The essay sets up Klosterman's usual set-up for each piece: a long paragraph or two about something slightly related to the main topic, then a sudden and revealing link to the main topic. In other words, the type of essay you're supposed to write for creative writing class. The fact is, sometimes Klosterman's tangents are intriguing. But after a while, you might find yourself wondering why the hell he went through all that to get to the main point of discussion.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, some essays feel like perfectly-constructed examples of pitch-perfect expositions on such topics as \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", \\"Saved By The Bell\\", and serial killers (as well as a drop-dead hilarious piece on the existential dread of cartoon ceral pitchmen). Other times, though, they seem to be magazine articles culled to fill out the required length of the book (the Guns and Roses cover band essay would not be out of place in \\"Spin\\", where Klosterman is employed, but it seems to not quite fit despite being about something less than reality). All in all, it's a typical case of good essays sometimes being hidden between odd or just plain \\"bad\\" pieces. It's the same with any essay collections for the most part.<br /><br />Klosterman's most interesting piece is the \\"Empire\\" one, which posits it as the inspiration for much of Gen X culture's outlook. To think about it, he has a point: the bad guy wins, the main hero doesn't win because he rejects his parent's way of life, and everything that could go bad does. The last piece, about the rise of \\"Left Behind\\" and Kirk Cameron in contemporary Christian circles, avoids the typically lazy bashing that most other writers use when approaching this subject. He points out that, up to a point, they are to be admired (he points the the moment when that admiration should end, however).<br /><br />Klosterman also offers insight into the media that argues bias on either side of the political spectrum is trumped by the desire to sell papers, sports journalists slowly grow to hate their professions because of atheletes and fans, and newspapers are programmed for illiterates. He makes some good points that should be considered in any journalism classes.<br /><br />Chuck Klosterman puts himself and his tastes out there, and you have to respect that whether you agree or not (Ken Tucker is particularly and oddly viscious about Klosterman in his own book about TV). His writing is bold, incisive, and best taken as the ravings of a slightly mad person who nonetheless sees a lot of meaning in things that most other people take for granted. \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" is sometimes too cute in its assumptions, but it makes up for that by being unfailingly fun to read. And that's really all you could ask of a book that discusses the ethical dilemmas of Zack Morris or whether John Cusack should apologize for raising the collective expectations of the world's women. There's plenty to enjoy in Chuck Klosterman's work, and you might find yourself looking differently at culture once you finish it.ch posits it as the inspiration for much of Gen X culture's outlook.

And Ebert collects some of his favorites in \\"The Great Books II\\", a continuation of the previous collection from 2002. To be sure, there are plenty of obvious \\"artistic classics\\", but it's the suprises that make this a worthy read.<br /><br />Ebert's reviews are presented alphabetically, with no frills. It's his writing that he's known for (apart from his show with the late Gene Siskel and now Richard Roeper), and that's what carries even the more boring choices. Heavy on French New Wave and Japanese cinema, sometimes the book could get to be too much for people looking for a casual recommendation. But even if you get tired of hearing about Godard, Cocteau, and every single French or Italian director who ever lived, there's plenty else to keep you interested.<br /><br />It's the surprises that make this book work for me; who would've thought that a critic with the esteem of Ebert would give time to movies like \\"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\\"...and not only talk about it, but praise it? As Ebert admits in the introduction, these aren't necessarily the *greatest* movies, but they're great for what they represent, what they speak about, and what they mean to continuing generations of people who discover them for the first time. \\"Spinal Tap\\" gets equal play to \\"Rashomon\\", \\"Scarface\\" is praised *for* Al Pacino's performance (most other peer reviewers cited him as the reason it didn't work), and \\"Say Anything\\", \\"Moonstruck\\", \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", and \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" get some well-deserved praise.<br /><br />What Ebert is doing with these reviews is that film criticism doesn't have to be \\"All Truffaut, All The Time\\"; you bring to a review what you like about the film, and what makes it work for you. And that's true whether you're talking about Nigel Tufnel's guitar amps or Ingmar Bergman's camera angles and lighting choices. Ebert proves you don't have to be a snob to be a film critic. It's your perspective, anyway, that's all that should matter as long as you bring intelligence to it and can back up your position.<br /><br />To be sure, Ebert's affection for foreign films gets to be a bit much, but the point is that he wants to expose readers not only to the obvious choices for any aspiring film-lover but to those films that he loves, and why. If he leads you to seek out some obscure flick that he praises for three pages-worth of the book, then he's done his job. And if you come away from it understanding why he chose to include the film in a book titled \\"The Great Films\\", then it's time well spent.<br /><br />Roger Ebert does first-rate criticism not only on the films that everyone would expect, but also on the films that few would think merit \\"serious\\" criticism. That's what makes \\"The Great Movies II\\" such a delight. And that's what makes Roger Ebert the greatest at his craft.<br /><br />So pick up \\"The Great Movies II\\", and hope that \\"The Great Books III\\" is just as good.or you.

American television has been the most maligned, beat-up form of entertainment in modern memory, and why not: a venue that makes stars out of people like Ray Romano, Carson Daly, and countless \\"Real World\\" contestants deserves all the ridicule heaped upon it. But generally, most TV critics can do more than simply say \\"this sucks\\".<br /><br />Ken Tucker, a veteran of \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" and \\"New York Magazine\\", is generally what I would consider one of the better writers when it comes to television criticism. But you wouldn't know that from his book. Slapping together 100 essays about TV with no rhyme or reason does not a coherent book make. Tucker defends his decision as an aesthetic one, but you wouldn't be alone if you thought his actual reason was laziness.<br /><br />That said, the book is interesting in spite of its flaws: Tucker shows the same wit, knowledge, and grasp of the medium that made his EW reviews so perfect to read. Sure, he beats the same drums that a lot of critics seem to obsess over: \\"The Sopranos\\", \\"Twin Peaks\\", etc. But Tucker's best wit shines through on his more unexpected choices: who would think a reputable critic would not only love the trashiness of \\"Silk Stalkings\\" or Pam Anderson's, um, \\"body of work\\", but say so in print?<br /><br />All in all, Tucker's problem is not his opinions (which, agree or disagree, are his own and that's why he wrote the book), but the simple laziness of the formatting. Back to Tucker's explanation: in the intro, he cites the \\"clicker\\" nature of TV watching as being a motivator for the \\"Love/Hate\\" Point/Counterpoint nature of his book. Which is fine, if more of the Love/Hates had actually been connected. Tucker goes from one point of praising Jennifer Garner's wig choice on \\"Alias\\" to slamming \\"Star Trek\\" (deservedly singled out as one of the worst franchises in the history of entertainment). But why? There's no logical reason to do so, even within the \\"anything goes\\" boundaries of Tucker's original clicker thesis. This causes an abrupt break from one essay to another. Though sometimes Tucker can actually find a connection between the \\"Love/Hates\\" (such as his praise for \\"Newsradio\\" while blasting Dave Foley's former job as a Kid In the Hall), they are few and far between.<br /><br />All of which means that this is a good book, one that you'll enjoy reading over an afternoon perhaps, but it's not \\"great\\". And, for anyone familiar with Tucker's more expansive EW reviews (the essays here rarely go over two pages in length), the short little takes leave you wanting more, and disappointed. Surely there's a better book to be salvaged from this mess? If Tucker had somehow organized his book more throughly, perhaps even introducing the concept of chapters and various other topics included without too much expansion, this might be worthy of more praise. I'm not looking for Tucker to contribute a \\"Lipstick Traces\\"-esque history of television, but his review of \\"Buffalo Bill\\" and \\"Profit\\" provide a nice glimpse into the tastes and preferences that make Tucker a fantastic read on most other occasions.<br /><br />The fact is, this is a good book hampered by the gimmick that may very well have led to its conception. Ken Tucker is a better writer than \\"Kissing Bill O'Reilly, Roasting Miss Piggy\\" suggests, but he did himself a disservice with the anything-goes formatting and pace. Intended as quick hits to keep readers from getting bored, it instead often goes by too quickly without leaving much of an impression. Maybe Tucker wanted to steer clear of serious criticism in favor of flighty reader-friendly takes instead.

In \\"SCTV: Behind the Scenes\\", former cast member Dave Thomas sifts through his memory bank to recount the tale of the little Melonville station that could.<br /><br />Now for the disclaimer: I haven't seen all that much of SCTV. NBC did a fair job of running reruns of the show a few years back, but I saw very little of it. I was interested in purchasing the DVD box sets when they first came out simply on word-of-mouth, but the price tags scared me off. So this is my first real look at the show...in a book form.<br /><br />Back to the review: Dave Thomas recounts the highs and lows of performing cutting-edge sketch comedy at a time when \\"Saturday Night Live\\" was gradually becoming the very \\"showbiz variety\\" program it had set out to mock. Beginning in 1976, and coming to an end eight years (and several network changes) later, the show was much-heralded but little-seen stateside during its prime. Only in the aftermath of its final Cinemax season, when the various cast members began turning up in a variety of comedy productions, did the show earn a small but cultish audience.<br /><br />The book starts with Thomas revealing how the show was born from the talents of various stage performers like himself, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Joe Flaherty, Andrea Martin, and others. Thomas proceeds to document the various behind-the-scenes struggles that the cast went through with producers and directors, and networks. From its lowly birth to the expansion to the States and going from a half-hour to a full ninety minutes (the \\"Network 90\\" version that most people remember when they think of SCTV), Thomas lets the reader in on all the various ups-and-downs that he and the rest of the cast went through to maintain creative control. In a time when producers like Lorne Michaels or Fred Silverman dictated the content, SCTV was unique in having control and final say on the direction of the show.<br /><br />Unlike its more popular peer SNL, SCTV was not littered with drug problems that picked off cast members ala Belushi or Farley. But they did suffer a big loss years later; Thomas provides a loving memorial to departed John Candy, the only one of the original cast who is not alive for interviews (the other absent voices, Levy and Martin, are thankfully very much alive; their absence is missed, but not necessary).<br /><br />Again, I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on SCTV, but after reading this book and keeping in mind the comedians who got their start, I feel a little more in awe of what they managed to achieve far from the madding crowd of American television crassness.<br /><br />Thomas's is not the only voice heard, as various personalities associated with the show (writers, producers, directors, and the cast) share their own tales. The oral history of anything is bound to be fraught with inaccuracies or omitted memories, but the book is coherent on many main points.<br /><br />From analyzing how he and Rick Moranis became distanced from their castmates thanks to their alter egos Doug and Bob McKenzie, all the way to what the cast are doing now (or \\"now\\" as in 1997, when the book was published), Dave Thomas shares memories and lets us in on the way SCTV worked. The result is a loving look back at what many of the cast members feel was their best work.

Lee (Penguin Lives)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	General Lee (The Man, Not The Car)	In the pantheon of American history, few figures are as elusive and unknowable as Robert E. Lee, the commanding general of the Army of Northern Virginia and the principal Confederate military leader in the Civil War. To try and encapsulate his life into one small, concise little book is pretty much impossible, but Roy Blount Jr. tries his best. And for that, he is to be applauded.<br /><br />Over the course of less than 200 pages, Blount examines Lee's life from his troubled past (Light-Horse Harry Lee, his Revolutionary War hero of a father, abandons the family and leaves his mother to raise their children), to his early military career (including brave missions for Winfield Scott during the Mexican-American War), up through his Civil War generalship and subsequent retirement to a small college to live out his last years. And Blount does it with the charm and wit that make him one of America's (and the South's) most treasured writers.<br /><br />Robert E. Lee, more a marble giant than a man in most other biographers' attempts, is fleshed out by Blount as a stoic, almost Calvinist man with some unusual attributes that make him more attractive than before. Blount does not try to apologize for Lee's decision to side with his state over the Federal Government, he also tries to illuminate Lee's human side with interactions with his children and various ladies other than his wife over the course of his life. The Robert E. Lee that emerges is a man who had a hard life, with little hope for more than a passing whiff of happiness, who saw his duty to his state and his class overreaching that of the nation he served so gallantly before. And he paid the price for that in the end.<br /><br />Blount is at his best when describing Lee's human side (such as his flirtations with other women, his relationships with his children, his care of pupils while in charge of West Point), and also in showing that Lee's military record during the Civil War was less than perfect. Indeed, the book focuses on what Blount calls Lee's \\"instinctive\\" generalship and how his inability to communicate with his subordinates cost him victory at Gettysburg. Lee's war is not a success in the end, but his image as a fatherly leader of his men helps to cement the postwar elevation to Godlike status among the defeated Southerners who clung to the ideals of the Confederacy.<br /><br />Robert E. Lee is too complex a figure to be summed up in the space of 200 pages, but what Blount does is provide a quick survey of his life and infuse it with enough detail to make for a great brief appreciation. In appendices to the main book, Blount also discusses Lee's humor (his fondness for a certain, almost obscene phrase a highlight) and his attitudes to slavery (Lee was sadly a product of his times, no matter how \\"kind\\" he may have been to his own slaves). Blount, a southerner himself, takes pains to show Lee in real terms, not as the demigod he has been promoted to in the wake of postwar nostalgia. Robert E. Lee was not an easy man to know, and Blount makes no attempt to act as if his is the \\"definitive\\" study. But through clever and interesting sidetracks into Lee's personality, Blount comes as close as anyone yet to getting a handle on the man behind the curtain, the real Robert E. Lee and not the myth.<br /><br />Roy Blount Jr., through the auspices of Penguin's Brief Lives series, gives us a portrait of Robert E. Lee than transcends the myth and looks at the facts behind the myth. The result is a man that emerges as a troubled and complicated leader of men whose failings had as much to do with his legend as his successes. Blount makes Lee human, something that other more esteemed historians seem to miss. For that, he should be commended. The Marble Giant comes alive, however briefly, and fans and detractors alike can find something to treasure in Roy Blount's honest appraisal of his life and times.the book focuses on what Blount calls Lee's \\"instinctive\\" generalship and how his inability to communicate with his subordinates cost him victory at Gettysburg.

Telfair himself is an intense but likable young athelete who comes across as more than just the sum of his shoe company endorsements and shady high school coach's dealings. And O'Connor masterfully describes the various elements that make basketball what it is today, on the high-school level.<br /><br />Sebastian (or \\"Bassy\\") Telfair is the product of an inner-city enviroment that promises little to many of his peers. Nonetheless, he is blessed with an unnatural ability to command the ball and also interact with his teammates in an unselfish style that seperates him from the ball-hogging \\"gangstas\\" that dominate the NBA. In Telfair, O'Connor finds a unique case study for his look at the way money can corrupt even the best atheletes. Telfair is smarter than most, able to avoid the pitfalls of financial entanglements while still a \\"amateur\\" status. But he has his own problems off the court.<br /><br />Telfair's father Otis, a Vietnam vet, was a nonentity during his son's formative years due to a prison conviction. His older brother Sylvester, also in and out of trouble with the law, figured prominently in concerns over Sebastian's ability to land with a team in the 2004 draft. And the neighborhood he grew up in on Coney Island is one of the worst in the country.<br /><br />Through it all, Telfair has his talent and his backers to keep him from becoming another statistic. As documented in \\"The Jump\\", Telfair is the local celebrity, and he is able to navigate through the tension of inner-city life because he has the chance to make it out.<br /><br />Telfair is surrounded by all sorts of hangers-on who want to ride him to glory: Ziggy Scaginano(sic), the former coach who first pinpointed Sebastian for greatness; Tiny Morton, Bassy's high school coach who falls under investigation for his participation in various tournaments for cash; Sonny Vaccaro, the former Adiddas and ReeBok chief who first courts Telfair then trys to undermine him allegedly; Stephon Marbury, Telfair's famous (and in the Telfair household, infamous) cousin; Rick Pitino, the college coach who banked on Telfair attending school instead; and a host of executives from NBA teams and sneaker companies, all with their eyes on the prize that is the Next Big Thing. And in their eyes, that Next Big Thing is a point guard named Sebastian Telfair.<br /><br />It would be fair to say that I'm not a huge basketball fan; I enjoy the game, but know little about it. In \\"The Jump\\", I think it's fair to say even a non-NBA fan would find something worthy to read. Whether it's Telfair's own struggles to transcend his enviroment without losing his soul, or the various goings-on that conspire to make his jump to the pros all that more difficult, O'Connor never loses sight of the narrative flow that makes this compelling story even more interesting.<br /><br />Modern sports has become a big-time business, and in \\"The Jump\\" Ian O'Connor documents how one player manages to keep his head above the water of endorsements, shady friends and agents, and the pressures of a typical high-school athelete magnified under the national spotlight. Sebastian Telfair may turn out to be the Next Big Thing, or the Next Big Flop.

And second, the publication of a relief pitcher's season diary with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros, a book that challenged the image of ballplayers forever.<br /><br />That book was \\"Ball Four\\", and it was the view of a memorable 1969 season for Jim Bouton, the author and a former star pitcher with the Yankees. Now down on his luck and struggling to remain on a major-league roster, Bouton decided to document his trek from the dungeons of the minor leagues to the full-fledged ecstasy of pitching a major league game successfully.<br /><br />It's the stories along the way, however, that made baseball squirm...<br /><br />Seen through the light of post-Watergate \\"destroying the heroes\\" (and through the troubling trend of post-9/11 to build them back up), \\"Ball Four\\" seems on some levels like \\"been there, done that\\". But seen through the context of the time it came out, it shook the foundations of the game and caused a major scandel for Bouton and kept him from being invited to Old Timers' Day in New York.<br /><br />Bouton was a former phenom whose fastball secured him a spot on the Yankees roster in the early Sixties, but by the time of the 1969 season he was struggling to find a new pitch to accomadate the sore arm that he acquired in place of that fastball. Here documented is his struggle with mastering the knuckleball, easily the most difficult pitch to control. Also, Bouton has money problems that his bosses aren't eager to resolve. Before Curt Flood's post-season trade disputes began, Bouton is seen fighting tooth-and-nail for a measly $1000 at a time, and his trade from Seattle could very well have had something to do with that (or his insistance on investing in a new product on the market, something called \\"Gatorade\\" which was supposedly better than soda for ballplayers).<br /><br />Bouton also discusses the times he's living in, and how baseball chooses to ignore them. Race relations, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, and all the issues that defined the Sixties never seemed to touch baseball, but Bouton gets under the skin of his teammates and his coachs by embracing some of the youth culture around him. Some of the funniest passages describe his reactions to the constant stream of country-and-western music at the back of the team bus, where he tries to \\"fit in\\" with the guys.<br /><br />Bouton is remarkably honest for a ballplayer, spicing his diary with revealing passages about himself, his past, and the pasts of those around him. That's what brought him before the auspices of comissioner Bowie Kuhn to \\"deny\\" what he wrote as being true. His discussions about Mickey Mantle (whose alcoholism eventually killed him) was seen as a Benedict Arnold-esque turn in 1970, but now we all know Bouton was telling the truth.<br /><br />Bouton's struggles with control both on the field and against his bosses make \\"Ball Four\\" a revelation, as it shows old-time baseball as the antiquated institution it is. He also revels in the fact that he's not a typical jock, and many of the teammates around him who may have been angered by tales about their own faults actually emerge as more sympathetic figures than they would have in the typical hagiograpchic sports screeds. Here they're real human beings, not the God-like figures of yore.<br /><br />Jim Bouton went from being a good pitcher with arm problems to a truth-telling Judas who wrote himself out of the game. But when the book you pen is \\"Ball Four\\", it might very well be worth it. Bouton will be remembered for his masterpiece of sports literature far longer than the critics who took him to task for that.

US	39802170	R3DKLA04VPX54Q	0156012952	475362106	All the King's Men	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Great for Summer Reading (or Reading Anytime)	\\"All The King's Men\\" is one of those great, weighty tomes of American literature that I had avoided reading for many years, simply because I didn't see the appeal of a 400+ page novel. But I finally got around to picking this up a month ago, and I have to say it is a fantastic example of the great American Novel.<br /><br />Based on the life and career of Huey Long (governor of Louisiana and major rival to FDR for the presidency before his death), the tale of Willie Stark is one of a good man corrupted by the very political machine that he needed to enact his reforms. We first meet Willie in the full swing of his corruption, but vingettes to the past reveal how innocent and truthful he was back in the beginning. The story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, Stark's righthand man who does what he's told no matter what. He has a mind of his own, but he sees Stark as a man who can affect positive change. But Stark's own corrupted nature renders that impossible, and everything he touches (including Burden and his family) turns to dust.<br /><br />Robert Penn Warren's book does have some faults: some might want more of Stark's story than is provided, and the Cass Mastern detour is interesting only in retrospect (at the time you're reading it, I challenge you not to count how many pages are left before the chapter is over).<br /><br />There are no real heroes in the piece, simply men and women caught up in the fury of Willie Stark and his desire for glory, and everyone comes to an unfortunate end through contact with him. Jack emerges as complicated and unsure of his own function within the Stark machinery, and Adam Stanton's descent towards his final actions (echoing the real-life assassination of Long by Carl Weiss) is rendered brilliantly. Perhaps the most moving chapter is when Jack relieves his first falling in love with Anne Stanton, in the wake of revelations which force him to reevaluate that summer.<br /><br />Warren doesn't adhere strictly to the Long story: he starts the \\"present day\\" portion of the book in 1936, well after Huey Long's death in September 1935. And Stark does not meet his end until the end of 1937, while still Governor (Huey Long had gone to the Senate in 1932 but still controlled Louisiana through his goons). Was Long simply the wellspring upon which Warren fashioned his extraordinary tale, or was there more of him in Willie Stark than Warren might have wanted? It's really up to the reader to decide.<br /><br />All in all, \\"All The King's Men\\" takes the story of a man who means good but loses his way and turns it into one of the Great American Novels of the first half of the twentieth century. Willie Stark's rise and fall make for a moving, illuminating tale, but his reign affects all those around him. And it is his presence that causes the events of the novel, and the actions of Jack Burden and those he loves. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and nowhere is that more evident than in \\"All The King's Men\\".ong story: he starts the \\"present day\\" portion of the book in 1936, well after Huey Long's death in September 1935.

In an exhuastive and well-paced dual biography of the world's greatest comedy duo, Louvish provides insights into the two men who jointly comprised a team that was embraced the world over.<br /><br />Stan Jefferson (Laurel) and Oliver Hardy could not have come from more different backgrounds: Laurel's father was a North England theater manager who dabbled in play-writing, and his son became an actor on the stage just as vaudeville was on its way out and films on their way in. Hardy never knew his father, a Civil War veteran and local celebrity in their part of the state of Georgia. Both men took long routes towards the inevitable pairing, as Louvish demonstrates in what can be felt as a \\"teaser\\" of near-misses and almost-rans between the two when they both arrive in Hollywood in the mid-teens. But in 1927, they finally teamed up and started what would become the most celebrated partnership in film comedy.<br /><br />Throughout it all, Louvish gives us a portrait of the men behind the image that is all the more important to know. Hardy, the jolly fat-man, was actually self-conscious about his weight and struggled to keep it under control. Laurel, the simple child-like companion, was something of a ladies man, and the tales of his multpile marriages (including a series of ill-timed weddings to the same woman over the course of years) make for an interesting glimpse into his troubled private life.<br /><br />Laurel and Hardy, together briefly during the last days of the silent era, were able to transcend the barrier of sound, and they may well have been meant for the new entertainment form. Louvish details how they not only survived in the wake of other silent performers (Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd) falling out of favor, but indeed prosper and contribute some of their best material in the early Thirties.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Louvish intersects accounts of the films they made together with some of the personal details that helped to shape their time together. He also addresses the odd fact of their embrace by the gay community, and Hardy's troubled Southern heritage and what it may have meant to the era of the Thirties (when openly racist portrayals of the black race ran rampant and unchecked). Stan Laurel emerges as a particularly harried figure, as his constant marital troubles become the fodder for Hollywood gossip mavens (a precursor of the current swath of \\"celebrity marital trouble\\" stories circulating in today's entertainment-obsessed media).<br /><br />In the entertaining way he critiques their work (first the golden years at Hal Roach's studio, then later the Twentieth Century Fox and MGM films), Louvish comes off not as a grumbling critic but a genuine fan, one who has sat through the dreck as well as the highlights. He can be trusted to give the straight story on the flops as well as the classics (\\"Sons of The Desert\\", \\"The Music Box\\", etc). Louvish's style is not the dry, bare-bones approach of more \\"scholarly\\" approaches to film, but he has the right amount of reverence to make up for any percieved flippancy towards his subjects. After all, his profile is that of a comedy duo, not an auteur like Kubrick or Godard.<br /><br />Louvish successfully argues, what's more, that the films of Laurel and Hardy (while not meant to be artistic statements) are worthy of close study and even analysis for their place in easing the country through the Depression and the Second World War (a claim that he puts forth for the lesser Fox pictures, though acknowledging their flaws). What's more, the friendship between Laurel and Hardy is genunine, unlike so many comedy partnerships that seem fraught with tension.<br /><br />The book is probably the closest wewill get to knowing the real Laurel and Hardy, as well as understanding their most memorable films together. It will definitely be the first thing I recommend for L&H neophytes, and for diehard fans as well. Put simply, this is the book to read if you want to know about the greatest comedy duo of the film age.the closest we will get to knowing the real Laurel and Hardy, as well as understanding their most memorable films together.

As this book shows, there was so much more.<br /><br />Ben Fong-Torres illuminates the early life of Parsons, including his troubled family's past, and discusses his music and its influence in the wake of his untimely demise. What it also does is make human a larger-than-life legend (as most are once their subject is passed on. Jim Morrison didn't become a \\"poet\\" until his death, really). Gram Parsons was a trust-fund kid with a world of problems, and little in the way of an ability to deal with them. Fong-Torres spares none of the grim details of his drug abuse and its effects on those around him.<br /><br />Also covered are the mysteries surrounding his death. There are numerous theoris abounding, but Fong-Torres sumises that the most likely is also the dullest (a accidental overdose), but therefore the most tragic. By the end of the book, you understand what rock and country lost with his passing.<br /><br />As someone who's just now getting into his music, I found \\"Hickory Wind\\" to be a great introduction to Gram Parsons, the musician and the man. It's impossible to know everything about our rock legends, but Ben Fong-Torres probably comes the closest to explaining Gram Parsons as I've seen any journalist do for their subject in a long time. Get this to learn about Gram Parsons; then pick up the FBB's first two albums so you understand what all the fuss is about.	2005-04-26

However you feel about that designation, most music fans would at least have it in their top five list if not at the very top. So a book like \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", about the making of Brian Wilson's masterpiece, is a welcome addition to any Pet Sounds fan's library.<br /><br />The book starts off retreading information about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys that has been covered in greater detail by Timothy White (The Nearest Faraway Place), but any repetition caused by this subsides once it gets to the nuts-and-bolts story of the album itself. From Brian enlisting Tony Asher to write the lyrics up to the album's release and re-emergence some thirty years later, Granata gives us as close a view as we are likely to get of a masterpiece in the making.<br /><br />The book kinda bogs down in technical details regarding the album, however. Anyone who isn't fascinated by the minute details of recording will probably try to breeze through this part. It's essential to understand the technical achievements brought about during the recording, of course, but Granata does very little to make this interesting reading.<br /><br />That aside, this is probably best for fans of the Beach Boys or the album particularly. I can't imagine someone who never heard or appreciated either would pick up this book, but just on the off chance that they do, they would be the least ideal audience for this.<br /><br />In all, I think \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" is probably the definitive history of the album and its importance to musical history. I recommend it highly for fans of the album who want to peek inside Brian Wilson's creative process.	2005-04-17
US	39802170	R276YP4JWRQ8X6	1573226882	326942117	Fever Pitch	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Fandom never had a better chronicler	Nick Hornby is, by now, the master of the male confessional, an astute observer of what it is that makes modern men tick. In this, his first book, Hornby turned the lens on himself and his life-long obsession with soccor. While some might not be able to relate to the soccor-heavy lore, most everyone will be able to relate to the notion of obsessive fandom, and how it can define (and deny the progress of) a life.<br /><br />Hornby structures the book around matches he attended, starting with a first memorable visit to Highbury in 1968. Here, an eleven-year-old Hornby finds the team that will become his obsession, and a crutch for the years to come: Arsenal. A previously great team that is down on its luck when he comes along, Hornby soon becomes a devoted watcher of even the team's worst defeats and draws. As the years wear on, and the matches fluctuate from utter despair to unrestrained joy, Hornby gives us a glimpse into why he loves this sport, and why he loves Arsenal in particular.<br /><br />Like most Americans, however, I had trouble following some of the action described in the book. Hornby's soccor-heavy knowledge (and his assumption that you, the reader, will know who or what he's refering to) might be a bit off-putting, which is why I don't recommend this for soccor-hating folks. But if you're a fan of Hornby's writing, even the dullest aspects of soccor culture take on a grand magnificance in Hornby's prose.<br /><br />All in all, I came away with the book with a deeper understanding of who Hornby is as a human being. Like all of us (particularly males), he is sports-obsessed, but then again any sort of obsession could be inserted and the book would still work. Be it pop music, the World Cup, or reading, Hornby is a praticed master at disecting and understanding the root of the neurosis. Hornby recognizes, like most fans, that he has a problem; like most fans, however, he wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />Even if you despise soccor, \\"Fever Pitch\\" is a must if you enjoy sports and good writing. Nick Hornby may be a world-class writer, but he is also a world-class fan. With this book, he tells you why, and you can understand why. Hell, if you follow a team with half the devotion of Hornby, you'll feel right at home with \\"Fever Pitch\\"r Pitch\\" is a must if you enjoy sports and good writing.

No straight-ahead biography could do him justice. That's where Jane Leavy comes in: rather than write a boring \\"life of\\" with dates and games and life off the field, she disects Koufax's essence through the recapulation of his perfect game versus the Cubs, on September 9, 1965.<br /><br />The book is daring in that regard, and through the context of this one game (a technique also used effectively by Buster Olney for his \\"Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty\\"), Leavy gives us as indepth a portrait of the man as we are likely to ever see. In descibing Koufax's career through the prism of this one magical game, she also lets us see the world around him as Koufax develops from a neglected \\"bonus baby\\" with a supposedly erratic arm into the legendary force of nature he became during 1961-1966.<br /><br />We get a look at Koufax's origins and other such minatinue that most biographies would cover as well, but Leavy uses Koufax as a mirror on the culture and society that evoloved around him at this time. She reminds us from the beginning that the night of Koufax's perfect game follows some of the most intense racial rioting in Los Angeles (Watts had erupted in flames just a few weeks earlier), and that Koufax himself faced the subtle and not-so-subtle manifestations of anti-Semitism that plagued baseball as much as society during that era.<br /><br />Through it all, we get a sense of the player that Koufax was, the special aura that he projected. But Leavy also sifts through the myths of this modern-day Hercules of the diamond to get at the truth, or what she can manage in the face of the man's wall of privacy. This is as true a portrait as we're likely to get of the man behind the legend, the most important lefty in baseball history.<br /><br />\\"Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy\\" should be required reading for anyone seeking to pen the biography of baseball figures of his stature. Rather than take the easy route and accuse Koufax of being \\"difficult to pin down\\", Leavy does the footwork to come up with a compelling, endearing, and above all interesting portrait of the most storied pitcher of the modern game. For that, she deserves a place among the best sportswriters to ever cover the game.

In \\"The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty\\", Buster Olney provides the reader with a unique and moving portrait of the Yankees of the late Nineties and the emotion-drenched season of 2001, when winning a baseball game for America's team took on more significance. What he emerges with is a portrait of a team on the brink of failure.<br /><br />Olney uses Game Seven of the World Series to build his narrative around, and he effectively conveys both the tense drama of that one storied night and the events and characters who came to be on that night. Olney breaks through the image of the Millenium Bronx Bombers as \\"invincible\\" to show their human side. Olney's task isn't easy, considering the restrictions George Steinbrenner places on clubhouse media, but he manages to peel away at the mystique and reveal a team of complicated individuals brought together by a desire to win, and the costs of constant success under a man like Steinbrenner.<br /><br />We get a look not just at men like Paul O'Neill, Scott Brosius, and Derek Jeter on the field, but also men in the front office like GM Brian Cashman, former manager Buck Showalter, and the Yankees' clipper for that championship run Joe Torre. Oleny humanizes the often faceless Yankee corporation, leaving the reader with sympathies for those most responsible for the impossible string of victories as they stare down the possibility of losing.<br /><br />Other profiles include Darryl Strawberry (whose plight with drugs has never been rendered so tragic before), Jorge Posada (an unsure prospect who emerged as one of the team leaders), and Chuck Knoblauch, who fell victim to a mysterious ailment during his tenure in the Bronx.<br /><br />Olney also lets us see the men who would upset the dynasty: men like Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson, who would carry on trying to beat the Yankees even after the emotional toll of September 11th made the New Yorkers \\"America's Team\\". Olney's book is not only a look at the championship run that came crashing down one November night in Arizona, but also the forces that converged in society and a larger perspective than just baseball to invest in the traditional game new notions of what it meant to keep playing in the wake of tragedy.<br /><br />This will long be the official history of that magnificant and hated Yankees run many years to come. No other book could do justice to the mighty New York Yankees of 1996-2001 and their amazing rise (and shattering fall). Buster Olney gives Yankee-lovers and Yankee-haters equal reason to identify with the team despite their alligences. You'll have to look long and hard to find a better glimpse into the machine that Steinbrenner built, before it self-destructed and became a shadow of its former self.> <br />Olney also lets us see the men who would upset the dynasty: men like Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson, who would carry on trying to beat the Yankees even after the emotional toll of September 11th made the New Yorkers \\"America's Team\\".

US	39802170	R3LC7DHU5NF4LL	0393324818	346106080	Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game	Books	4	6	9	N	N	A Great Read (Even If You Don't Buy the Premise)	In Moneyball, author Michael Lewis sets out to show how you can win as a major-league franchise when your roster looks more like the Bad News Bears than a professional outfit. Whether or not he convinces you the reader of his purpose is up to you (I don't necessarily agree with it), but it makes an interesting and illuminating read.<br /><br />In many ways, it is an alternative history of baseball in the modern era: in a time when home-run sluggers are prized above all else (nevermind how they got those homers), the Oakland A's of Billy Beane take a different tact. Smallball is king in Beane's view, one that he formed while as a member of the Oakland management team. Beane's own brief career is documented by Lewis, as well as the rise of baseball stats guru Bill James and the cult of numbers he helped inspire (sabremetrics). Beane is one of the few baseball men who not only reads James's theories, but tries to apply them to his team.<br /><br />The story almost speaks for itself: at the time of writing, the A's had managed to continuously appear in the playoffs. Doubters will scoff that Beane's methods fail in the long run: where are the World Series rings? The fact that a small-market team like the A's can manage a run like they have, with the limited resources they have, seems to be overshadowed by that glaring lack of wins when it counts.<br /><br />And so, without denying the veracity of James's arguements as they are presented in the book, I personally didn't buy Beane's approach. Too often, it seemed, Beane and his cohorts were reducing the game on the field to a series of continuous data sheets, typing out the player's ability to get on base over their ability to hit home runs or run the bases. While it's good to try and overthrow some of the baseball \\"traditions\\" that have actually served to harm the modern game, Moneyball offers a solution that is almost \\"scorched earth\\" in its approach: throw out the old rules and concentrate on stats previously ignored.<br /><br />On some level, Moneyball doesn't necessarily champion Beane's approach, but Lewis plays into the hands of the A's by (inadvertantly by his postscript account) making Beane out to be a wizard at figuring out the game. This is the same Beane who traded Johnny Damon to the Red Sox (readers in the post-Red Sox Series win last year could be forgiven for laughing a little at Beane's short-sightedness). This is the same Beane who traded two of his \\"big Three\\" pitchers in the past offseason. This is the same Beane who struggles to manage what little cash he has, and he is prone to mistakes. While Lewis doesn't shy from that side of the equation, he almost never addresses the failures of Beane's system as much as its successes. There is something unique about Beane's approach, that is for sure. But Lewis almost destroys his own arguement by leaving out those details that don't fit with his hypothesis.<br /><br />Also, for a baseball book \\"Moneyball\\" is totally lacking in terms of giving the reader a \\"feel\\" for the team in question. Beane and his hired helpers are (rightly or wrongly) the focus of the tome, to the exclusion of players like Barry Zito or Tim Hudson.

This is the same Beane who traded Johnny Damon to the Red Sox (readers in the post-Red Sox Series win last year could be forgiven for laughing a little at Beane's short-sightedness). This is the same Beane who traded two of his \\"big Three\\" pitchers in the past offseason. This is the same Beane who struggles to manage what little cash he has, and he is prone to mistakes. While Lewis doesn't shy from that side of the equation, he almost never addresses the failures of Beane's system as much as its successes. There is something unique about Beane's approach, that is for sure. But Lewis almost destroys his own arguement by leaving out those details that don't fit with his hypothesis.  <br /> <br />Also, for a baseball book \\"Moneyball\\" is totally lacking in terms of giving the reader a \\"feel\\" for the team in question. Beane and his hired helpers are (rightly or wrongly) the focus of the tome, to the exclusion of players like Barry Zito or Tim Hudson.

This is The Book	It would be easy in this day and age to pen yet another anti-Bush diatribe, just as it would a pro-Bush one (just look at the best-seller list if you don't believe me). But John Powers takes a step back from the rhetoric and looks at the culture as a whole in this post-9/11 world. It might be overstating the point at this juncture, but \\"Sore Winners\\" may well become the primary source for future generations seeking to understand why we are the way we are since that terrible day in September.<br /><br />Powers spares no one with his withering attacks (or his unusual defenses, such as that for George W. Bush from those who think he's homophobic), and his prose grabs you right off the bat and makes for a compulsive read. But there's more going on here, too: for all his ruminations on the nature of \\"American Idol\\" or Dave Eggers's career, Powers never loses sight of his focus on the way the Bush administration has influenced culture these past four years. Through all his wanderings, he comes back to a distinct thought: As Bush has been defined by 9/11 and Iraq, so too has the country through Bush's behaviour.<br /><br />Conservatives will have plenty to grumble about (especially his warrented dismissals of Ann Coulter and Fox News), but the left doesn't come up smelling like roses, either. In fact, it would be fair to say that Powers is an equal-opportunity offender. On occasion, his statements can seem childish, but often he comes through with a laser-sharp remark (like calling Sean Hannity the \\"guy who didn't get Jimmy Kimmel's job on 'The Man Show'.\\") that makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />There will no doubt be more scholarly works attempting to discern the nature of American culture at this peculiar time (our obsession with consumerism at a time when we're under attack will inspire some good ole-fashioned Socialist revisionism), but for now, Powers' is a good text to start with. Through all the verbal jokes and throwaway statements, Powers's book nonetheless is very serious about our post-9/11 culture and the impact of having neo-cons in control has had on our world. He ends with a call to vote out the bastards which seems achingly painful in the wake of reading this post-2004 elections, but the message is still applicable: you don't have to take this crap lying down.<br /><br />In many ways, this book reminded me of Tony Hendra's \\"Going Too Far\\", in the sense that it analyzes a wide spectrum of topics under a particular unifying theme. In fact, I'd venture that the two could be companion volumes, for Hendra's book doesn't just address satire but the nation into which it took effect after WWII. It would be fair to say that satire has died a slow death during George W. Bush's watch.<br /><br />The world is a weird and confusing place now, and it may be easy to get caught up in the emotions of our time. But \\"Sore Winners\\" lays bare the course of events that have brought us to a point where we choose fear over common sense. For that, it will continue to resonate long after the figures it discusses are heaped upon the dustbin of history.very serious about our post-9/11 culture and the impact of having neo-cons in control has had on our world.

This book goes where no one else has.<br /><br />Some might be quick to level charges of \\"Bush-bashing\\" against Seymour Hersh, the legendary reporter who uncovered the My Lai massacre and the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandel. But Hersh is a reporter first. His skills are put to use in \\"Chain of Command\\", a collection of the \\"New Yorker\\" pieces that put him on the Bush Administration's enemies list. Naysayers be damned, this is likely to be the most accurate history we'll get on the post-9/11 era.<br /><br />Hersh's scope is wide, from the oft-reported lies about WMDs and the passing of blame from on high to the lowly guards at Gitmo and Ghraib, but also including the Afghanistan campaign which may not have gone exactly the way Donald Rumsfeld and Fox News would have you believe. Throughout it all, Hersh paints a portrait of the Bush Administration as criminally inept and contradictory when the facts don't serve their purposes.<br /><br />Many of the one-star reviews will accuse Hersh of a bias against Bush and his cronies, and there's some truth to that. But Hersh's righteous anger is triggered by the waste and horror unleashed by the Administration in Afghanistan (where an early victory over the Taliban is squandered when the focus turns to Iraq and the Taliban resurges in the provinces) and Iraq (where faulty intelligence serves the Hussein-hating fears of Cheney and the Pentagon).<br /><br />There's too much in Hersh's accounts that cannot be explained away as \\"liberal bias\\" or \\"typical anti-Bush\\" fearmongering. Hersh backs up his stories with unnamed sources, unnamed not because they are untrustworthy but because they are in sensitive positions and risk their careers talking to Hersh. Snicker all you want that Hersh might be led down paths of disinformation, it's pretty hard to argue with his assessment that the Bush Administration bungled  their mission and deliberately misled the American people to further their own goals. And of course, in this Age of Fear they were rewarded for it at the ballot box.<br /><br />\\"Chain of Command\\" will shatter any illusions you have about the War on Terror, the Bush Administration, and the Middle East's reaction to our efforts there. If you want to know why our boys are continuing to come back in bodybags long after \\"Mission Accomplished\\" or why our policies have made more enemies than friends, this is the book to read. Be warned, though; you won't be able to ignore the truth behind the war after this. Hersh's anger is the anger we all should have towards Bush and his henchmen.misled the American people to further their own goals.

US	39802170	R4HCJM6KFD0HR	1573223565	687876775	Songbook	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Better the second time around	If you had the chance to write your thoughts on 30+ favorite songs of yours and have them published in a format wide enough to be read by people from New York to New Delhi, would you? Where would you begin? Which songs would you whittle down to acceptable for inclusion? How much would your thoughts reflect the song itself? How much based on your own situation in regards to the song? These are the questions I came away with when I read (and re-read) Nick Hornby's brilliant little book, and I think I could pull off something as moving at times as his writings, but I don't know for sure.<br /><br />The impetus of this book is music, which is a given seeing as music is a Hornby staple either in \\"High Fidelity\\" or \\"About a Boy\\" (the other two Hornby books I've read, not including his new book about reading). What is surprising is the amount of time spent not on the songs themselves, but on Hornby's own feelings and reflections on his life. This will annoy the diehard music fan in you, if you come into the book looking for analysis or, god forbid, \\"rock critic\\"-like musings (as I must admit I did, even though I'd read the introductory essay explaining that this wasn't that kind of book). But upon re-reading it, I saw the point Hornby must have been trying to make about how songs relate to our lives, even in ways we didn't realize.<br /><br />It's tempting to say that Hornby is showing off his extensive knowledge of pop music (in Hornby's world, \\"pop\\" is anything and everything recorded since the early Fifties, not just the kiddie-band crap) or that he's putting off a \\"real\\" book, another novel perhaps. Essay collections have become a staple of my personal library, however, and Hornby does his best to at times join the essays together in a manner suggesting the continuation of a theme from one song to another. The lack of familiarity one might have with some of Hornby's picks actually helps pique interest in the tunes themselves, to see why Hornby loves them so.<br /><br />The essays that you come away with are the ones that dig deep into Hornby's own life: for example, \\"A Minor Incident\\" causes Nick to re-evaluate his novel \\"About a Boy\\" now that it's been made into a film. And \\"First I Look at The Purse\\" lets Hornby relive his first trip to the States, when he first realized how awful things were back home in Britain. Other essays also stick in the memory long after you finish the book.<br /><br />In addition to the original 31 songs, the paperback makes space for album reviews Hornby did for \\"The New Yorker\\". Ranging from Aimee Mann and Steve Earle to what's on the Billboard Top Ten one week in early 2001, these provide still more glimpses at Hornby's tastes. He praises Los Lobos' box set while shaking his head at the sometimes obscene rants of Eminem (though I think perhaps Horby makes the mistake of not seeing Slim Shady's occasionally brilliant, if maddening because they're few and far between, satire on the modern pop world). The book ends with a helpful discography for those readers like myself who want to see what Hornby sees in these tunes.<br /><br />The selection might be a bit obscure, you might wonder what Hornby's essays sometimes have to do with the song in question, but you will finish the book (or in my case, re-finishing), with a deeper understanding for Hornby the man. More so than his novels, Nick lets the reader in on his life through this music that he loves so much. I doubt that if anyone else got paid to discuss their favorite songs, they could be half as elequont.

I'm fairly new to initiation into the \\"Red Sox Nation\\" (my heartbreak beginning with the 2003 ALCS and Aaron F. Boone), but I've been a fan of the team for its history and its storied lore for a long time, almost as long as I've loved baseball. So to see the Sox come back and mount the greatest comeback in sports history this past season was truly a delight for me, but I can only imagine what it must be like for the diehards.<br /><br />That's why I love this book, a diary of the 2004 season that lets me see what the Sox were really up against when they began their championship run. Stuck in the deep South, where the Braves are king, I couldn't keep up with the day-to-day games and drama that surrounded this team until their resurgence against the Yanks made them must-see TV. Stephen King and Stewart O'Nan combine to offer the perfect mix of baseball-nerd stats and scores with just a dash (a big wapping one) of diehard fan-crazy partisanship and pain. The heartbreaks and well-deserved rewards of the Red Sox this year make this a must-read for anyone who's a fan of the game.<br /><br />King and O'Nan may be more literary-minded than the average BoSox fan, but their perspectives on the season are just what you'd expect from two diehards; they live and die with each play. You see the griping about management that followed the Garciaparra trade as well as the praise heaped upon his worthy replacement (Orlando Cabrera). You see the Monday-Morning quarterbacking of manager Terry Francona and the way that changes when \\"Francoma\\" comes into his own in August and beyond. You get the outrage over A-Rod's trade to the Yanks, then the joy in seeing his pathetic attempts to steal the ALCS with a \\"unprofessional\\" swat at Bronson Arroyo's glove. All in all, you get the passion and the pagentry that is Baseball, and Red Sox Baseball at that.<br /><br />This was next year, there is no curse to hang over the Boston Faithful anymore, and Curt Schilling is my pick for Greatest Pitcher Ever. This book documents all that, and it's almost as much fun to read as the ALCS and World Series were to watch.tcher Ever.

Now, some seven years later, I finally got around to getting my own copy and finishing it recently, I can say it was worth the wait.<br /><br />Hunter S. Thompson may have only been thirty when the book comes to a close, but he does so much living in the 12 years detailed that one can't help but feel envious. From his stint in the Air Force to his various travels cross-country and to South America, Thompson remains a fiercely independent creature throughout his letters, heaping scorn and praise upon those he corresponds with as he sees fit. The bulk of the first part concerns Thompson's unfruitful look for a steady writing assignment early on, and one feels the sense of desperation and (dare I say) fear and loathing he builds up for the workaday world. Thompson's muse carries him far and wide, to outposts both remote (the heart of deepest South America) and wellknown (New York, San Francisco). Through it all, Thompson never loses sight of his original passion for the written word.<br /><br />Some of the letters are to family or friends, with some fiery dispatches to entities Thompson felt had hurt him or America in some way (imagine writing a letter to Dubya like the ones Thompson wrote to LBJ without getting the Secret Service breathing down your neck). The friends that Thompson collects range from obvious (Hells Angels, other struggling literati), to the baffling (I had no idea Charles Kuralt and Thompson knew one another). Throughout, Thompson's savage wit and fiery temper burn through even the most customary notes to landlords or editors.<br /><br />In some ways, Thompson's constant refrain of the \\"n-word\\" is disturbing to more modern readers, but like the great writers of the past he is a product of his times. To omit the phrase or other derogatory terms Thompson used in the original letters would be to deny the authenticity of his feelings, and once any initial shock wears off it becomes apparent that Thompson may not even be using the term to refer specifically to African-Americans. That was my only qualm with the content, and it's a credit to his maturity over the course of the years contained that Thompson seems to be far more liberal than his peers from Kentucky.<br /><br />The first volume made me want to go out and buy the second right away, if only to see what predicaments the Great Gonzo finds himself in. No one wrote letters quite like HST, letters that could stand in their own right as bizarre snapshots of an America in transition. I've even found my own e-mail length increasing mightily since I began the book (for which I apologize to anyone from here on out who I send an unusally long e-mail to). You'll come away from this book with a deeper appreciation for the work Thompson has done to document the death of the American Dream. Captured within these pages are his first inklings that such a thing has come to pass.<br /><br />From fellow journalists like William Kennedy and Tom Wolfe to LBJ and the NRA, Thompson's letters reflect the wide spectrum of Sixties personalities. Perhaps the most engaging character throughout is Thompson himself. For all his egotism, he is a great writer. The proof is in this book.of his feelings, and once any initial shock wears off it becomes apparent that Thompson may not even be using the term to refer specifically to African-Americans.

The articles collected in here range a wide variety of topics, and even the duller pieces are punctuated with traces of brilliance.<br /><br />The most memorable for me (seeing as I haven't read it in a few years) deal with some interesting and illuminating topics, both of their time and somehow relevant today:<br /><br />The title piece dealing with custom cars (what's the hottest reality show staple besides weddings and home decor?)<br /><br />Phil Spector's oddness (chilling in light of his recent legal troubles)<br /><br />The beginnings of what would become NASCAR (now the biggest sport in the South)<br /><br />Cassius Clay AKA Muhammed Ali (the role of the black athelete in American society is still being worked out)<br /><br />Vegas' rise from the desert<br /><br />There are countless others, products of their time and yet transcending eras to speak to us today.

Peter Sellers offscreen could be a monster to those around him, but this was all part of his many moods. A man-child with no distinct personality of his own, he found himself only through the roles he took on (Dr. Strangelove, Inspector Clouseau, Chauncy the Gardener).<br /><br />Ed Sikov's book, which I read about a year ago, recounts all the triumph and tragedy, angst and ecstasy, and the many contradictions of Sellers the man and movie star. It reads like a sympathetic but unbiased take on the man and his work. Sikov goes at great length to show not only the horrible things that Sellers did, but also the wonderful things he did on occasion (while tempering this with the knowledge that Sellers expected much in return). I doubt a more honest and yet tender portrait of the man could be written.<br /><br />Sikov doesn't shy from Sellers's problems, but he offers some insight into why they might have come to be: a distant father, a needy mother, and relatives who indulged the young boy, all the way to his last wife's abuse of their estate in order to kill herself with drugs. Throughout it all, Sellers is the central figure around which madness unravels, and unravele him as well. You come away from it feeling pity for Sellers because of the circumstances which contributed to his madness, but mindful as well of the lives he touched (for good or bad) with his talent and ego.<br /><br />You won't find yourself embracing Sellers when you finish the book, but you won't find yourself eager to rid him from your pantheon of comedy heroes either. Peter Sellers was a walking contradiction, and Ed Sikov does his best to expose the many faces Sellers showed not only to the world at large but to those he loved in particular. A man of such genius deserves no less than to have his story honestly rendered, and \\"Mr. Strangelove\\" does that exceptionally.Ed Sikov does his best to expose the many faces Sellers showed not only to the world at large but to those he loved in particular.

You may not agree with him, you may even find him tiring, but you will never find him dull.<br /><br />Which is why I enjoyed the travelogue \\"Queenan Country\\", describing a solo trip the Bard of Philadelphia took to his wife's home country, to see it through his own bitter lens rather than as part of a familial obligation. What he finds is a country that is rather odd, but nonetheless intoxicating in its eccentricities.<br /><br />Readers more familar with Queenans' bitterest works (I'm thinking primarily of Red Lobster, White Trash, and The Blue Lagoon) will be surprised at the degree to which Queenan actually has nice things to say about his erstwhile subject. But anyone who picked up Joe's most recent book (True Believers) is aware that his work has begun to take on a gentler tone. Perhaps it has something to do with age, or perhaps it's a result of his brief attempt at niceness (documented in \\"My Goodness\\", which I still have yet to read). Or perhaps, it's because Queenan has a genuine love for the British Isles that holds him back from ripping it to shreds. Whatever the reason, it would be fair to say that longtime readers might be dismayed by the kinder, gentler Joe Queenan.<br /><br />But don't be fooled: Queenan does find things to bitch about. Hiking boots, revisionist tour guides, and football hooligans pop up, as do various other aspects of British culture that Joe could do without. The royal family, though slammed as a collection of dullards and even more dullards, gets off rather light, as does a faux \\"Beatles confidante\\" who leads Joe to believe that John Lennon was his best man (he wasn't). Again, are these signs that America's Favorite Literary Grouch is mending his ways? Probably not, but he is still engaging the sacred cows of culture.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a love-letter to England, Queenan's adopted second home since his marriage, and it is fittingly mixed with admiration and chastisement to make a succulent pudding. The travels and travails that befall Queenan remain bizarre and fascinating, and there's a real (dare I say) heart to his look at the English. Whether he's attacking the pompous Shakespeare conspiracy theorists (after all, the Beatles weren't college-educated, and they made the best music ever), or asking about the matter of Edward II's \\"poker face\\", Joe Queenan is guarenteed to entertain. From this non-reluctant Anglophile, my thanks for writing this book./>Overall, this book is a love-letter to England, Queenan's adopted second home since his marriage, and it is fittingly mixed with admiration and chastisement to make a succulent pudding.

In this, her third work, Vowell lays out her obsession with American history and culture against the backdrop of her own quirky imagination.<br /><br />It's been a while since I first read the book, so I'm afraid I can't offer a detailed, omniscent review (but then again, none of my reviews have ever really fallen into that category). But what I can tell you is that no one has ever been able to write a book that combined reflections on the role of Abraham Lincoln or Rosa Parks on our modern psyche with how-to guides for future presidential libraries and a trip to the underground cafeteria at a national park. Throughout her essays, Vowell displays a grasp not only of the subjects, but of their deeper meanings in reference to American culture.<br /><br />The book is over before you want it to be, something I felt also could be said about the previous Vowell work I've reviewed (Take the Cannoli), but you're left with a desire to reevaluate your own approach to the many facets of American history. Overall, the book is a love letter to those things in America that Sarah, and the reader in turn, finds fascinating. You couldn't ask for a better read.	2004-11-06

But I have seen Jon Stewart, and I have read this book. I'm 2/3s qualified to write this review.<br /><br />Forget everything you learned in school about the majesty and triumph of American democracy: it's a load of dog poop compared to what you'll learn from reading this tome. For example, I never knew that America was also known as \\"The USA\\" and what's more, that \\"USA\\" stood for \\"United States of America\\". Where else can you get eye-opening minatinue like that?<br /><br />The gist of the book is how democracy, once a tender babe in the arms of George Washington, was dropped on its head by Franklin Pierce, left out in the cold by Woodwrow Wilson, almost starved by Dwight Eisenhower, and molested by Richard Nixon. Now it's an embittered 45-year old convenience store clerk working the night shift on George W. Bush's watch.<br /><br />So the next time you're in Wal-Mart...wait, they won't carry this book for some reason. Godless communists!<br /><br />So the next time you're surfing Amazon, be sure to buy \\"America: The Book\\". Jesus will smile upon you if you do.<br /><br />And I owe Lee Greenwood an apology for thinking he meant the United Arab Emirites when he sang \\"God Bless the USA\\"	2004-10-22

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	5	29	34	N	N	Exposes the Right-Wing Lie machine	It's certainly interesting to think how the Republican Party has been able to adopt the mantle of \\"The Party of the Working Man\\" in the past quarter-century, on the heels of Nixon's 1968 bid for the White House, when you consider how askew from one another the common laborers are from their conservative brethern. In \\"What's The Matter with Kansas?\\", Thomas Frank answers a lot of the questions concerning this most recent seismic shift in American politics. And he does so brilliantly, by focusing on an area where Republicanism has triumphed over common sense: Frank's home state of Kansas.<br /><br />Many of the one-star reviews of this book will say that Frank has a bias at work, that he's setting out to expose the right's control of his state and much of the rest of America as worthy of ridicule and even shame. They have a point, but even allowing for that doesn't excuse the fact that Frank documents his expose often with the very words of the pundits and politicos who he targets for exposure.<br /><br />The book starts off a little slow, discussing economic issues in the nitty-gritty detail that only a math freak could love. But in some way, that proves one of Frank's points about the Conservative movement; bored with economic issues that they could solve if they tried but which would require tough decisions that might cost re-election, the Cons decide instead to tackle social issues that they know will unify their base (abortion, TV and movie violence, etc) and give them a never-ending platform to run on.<br /><br />Frank documents the Cons' disgust with the modern culture, even while they do nothing to amend it. Don't you think, if the Conservative Revolution was so hell-bent on cleaning up our airwaves, they would have actually done so by now? Frank makes the point that running on such issues plays into the conservative mentality of \\"persecution\\" and self-defeating prophecy. After all, if you can't get abortion outlawed, it's not your fault; it's all those liberals who control the government, right.<br /><br />Frank lays bare the persecution defense and exposes it for what it is: a pipe dream of the Neoconservatives. What's more, the whole idea of liberals controlling everything is simply a tool the Cons use to mobilize their forces. The liberal bogeyman is little more than an invention of the various right-wing pundits (Ann Coulter, Fox News, etc) and doesn't accurately reflect the power structure in America anymore.<br /><br />Indeed, as Frank points out, it's the Conservatives who've taken the lead in governing America. While the Democrats have tried to distance themselves from their working-class roots, the Republicans have taken over several issues that were once the bread-and-butter of genuine liberal reforms. In Kansas, there is even a split between the socially liberal Republicans of affluent suburbs and the dyed-in-the-wool conservatives of the lower-income developments. Throughout the book, Frank gives us a portrait of the many varieties that have been attracted to the Republican cause.<br /><br />Attracted at the cost of their financial well-being, Frank argues, because the Republicans do little to allieviate the economic woes of the downtrodden who flock to their ranks because they don't favor abortion or government interference. This, argues Frank, is the ultimate triumph of the Conservatives: they've taken the focus off issues of economics and distracted what would normally be a Democratic majority with social issues that they know are \\"sexy\\" enough to attract voters.<br /><br />The book is simply a must-read for liberals and conservatives alike, as it sets down the course of American politics and how the religious Right and other far-right fronts have benefited from the past thirty years of social change. Throughout it all, Thomas Frank proves to be a steady guide through the various discrepencies between what the Conservatives promise and what they actually deliver. Frank speaks not so much as a liberal trashing conservatives but as a common American baffled by the reversal of the common vote from a party that was built on helping them to a party which was built on holding them back. The great tragedy, then, is not so much that Kansas has become a red state, but that in doing so it's allowed the people there to suffer loss of jobs and economic hard times.<br /><br />Kansas serves as a metaphor for \\"the flyover states\\" who continue to send Republicans to office against their own best interest, and the book exposes the lies (and the lying liers) who help to maintain this shift. Thomas Frank has performed an invaluable service to all of America with this book, and I highly recommend it for even the most diehard conservative. It'll open your eyes, it'll make you angry, and it will make you think. And then, maybe, it'll make you change.a liberal trashing conservatives but as a common American baffled by the reversal of the common vote from a party that was built on helping them to a party which was built on holding them back.

The former Daily Show guru plows through years of lies and half-truths to uncover the deadly secret that will rock Washington to its core: Presidential pets play more of a role in the affairs of state than previously believed....<br /><br />Okay, Mo Rocca may have fudged some of the facts, and he may not be telling the full story of his scandelous May-December romance with White House Chief Correspondent Helen Thomas. And sure, Laurie Dhue may not be a killer cyborg and...oops, I've said too much.<br /><br />This book, Rocca's first, is a tongue-in-cheek look at the world of Presidential pets, a world that used to be regarded merely as a \\"photo op\\" to make various Presidents look human. In fact, once you finish this tome you will realize that maybe, just maybe, presidential pets have more to do with the wise decisions our commanders-in-chief make.<br /><br />Rocca's journey takes him to a hidden lair underneath the White House Press Room, where veteran reporter Helen Thomas (actually a 200+ year old turkey eagle) keeps a secret archive relating the unknown history of just how important presidential pets have been. In the corridors of power, he encounters resistance from the Bush Cabinent to acknowledge information gleaned from those archives. Betrayed by someone who knew about the archives, Rocca and Thomas see their precious documents destroyed. Finally, in a showdown only Jerry Bruckheimer can bring to the screen, Rocca confronts the evil conspiracy that threatens to neuter the presidential pets' power forever. Several of his collegues and political contacts meet a bloody end in a scene so ambitious and so exhilerating that you'll just have to wait for the Hollywood adaptaion.<br /><br />The book works if you suspend your disbelief...really, really suspend it. I have to say overall, this is an impressive, if slightly muddled and occasionally frustrating, debut from Rocca. Those of you familiar with \\"Mike Nelson's Death Rat!\\" by Michael J. Nelson (MST3K) will find that this is a similar style of humorous fiction. In this case, Rocca includes real people, with their real names, and proceeds to run full tilt with a story that has to be read to be appreciated.<br /><br />Overall, I think the book is winning enough to merit further readings, and I hope Mr. Rocca can continue his groundbreaking studies into just how presidential pets have shaped our nation's history. The world needs to know the real role of Millie, Socks the cat, and all the other pets who have called the White House home. It might shock you, it might embarass you, but it will never fail to entertain you.casionally frustrating, debut from Rocca. Those of you familiar with \\"Mike Nelson's Death Rat!\\" by Michael J.

I have seen this book around for ever, I'd read the Conan and Andy Richter interviews in book stores, but I finally picked it up a week ago. Let me tell you, it's worth whatever you pay for it.<br /><br />The book contains glimpses into the lives of various types of entertainers, from the well-know to the washed-up. I could go on about various aspects of each interview, but I think I'll just cut to the chase and list the ones that really stuck with me:<br /><br />Rick James talking about his hardships<br /><br />Conan O'Brien describing the pitfalls of a studio audience<br /><br />Robert Forster explaining his philosophy of life<br /><br />Merle Haggard regretting \\"Okie From Muskogee\\" being used by the far-right<br /><br />Elvira discussing Coors' decision to drop her in favor of Pamela Lee<br /><br />Mr. T going on and on (I could just hear him saying all this from reading it)<br /><br />The commentaries range from the bitter (Harlan Ellison is a trip) to the resigned (The Unknown Comic), but the real bonus is the nuggets of truth to be gleaned from each interview. The fact that all the performers included stuck to their artistic guns, even in the face of changing cultural trends, is a good lesson for any aspiring entertainers. The messge is \\"be true to yourself, and you will achieve your goals sooner or later.\\"<br /><br />I think the ratio of good interviews outweighs the bad ones, and the four or five seperate interviews with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross certainly caught my eye after just recently picking up the \\"Mr. Show Complete First and Second Season\\" DVD.<br /><br />The Onion AV Club, for my money, publishes the best interviews in the field of entertainment, and this is a gold-standard collection of some of the best.	2004-10-01

I mean that respectfully.<br /><br />Kennedy describes in hilarious and wince-inducing detail his many travails, from receiving the wrong Christmas present at age ten to his inability to get his own \\"Smitty's\\" coffee shop, being relegated to the cart outside on a dock devoid of any customers. At every turn, it seems like Dan might be finally striking gold...but then again, the theme of the book is his many disappointments and failures. Throughout it all, he maintains his dark wit and lackluster approach to the job world.<br /><br />This hit close to home for me because I've been stuck in the same awful job for the past six years, and I often wonder if I'll get out and do anything substantial with my life. Plus, my life has been a series of mis-steps and wrong choices, coupled with endless humiliation and an impending sense of futility against all that the world throws at me. So to have my fears echoed by this guy in his book was refreshing. Plus, as Sarah Vowell's comment on the back jacket says, it's a \\"how-not-to\\" guide rather than a \\"ho-to\\".<br /><br />Overall, the book plays fast and loose with the conventions of autobiography, and you could say in some ways that it's a much shorter \\"Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\". Through all the mishaps and mistakes that pepper his life, Dan Kennedy remains interesting and engaging in his book. I hope we can all find our own outlet for talent in a lot shorter amount of time than he did, however.	2004-09-12

Patrick and Olbermann, and I have to say it is a great read for any sports and ESPN buff. Plus, the naked pics of Dan are to die for (just kidding).<br /><br />This book came out some seven years ago, when Olbermann was still allowed on the grounds at Bristol, but it resonates today because a lot of it holds true. Forget the somewhat dated references to the Macarena, and you'll enjoy it for what it is: two co-workers locked in deadly combat over whether the 1899 Cleveland Spiders deserve mention or not.<br /><br />Patrick and Olbermann were the anchor for the good times at Sports Center, and they write with absolute candor about their time in bottom-feeding jobs across the country before they fulfilled their destinies as the premier wiseasses for a generation. The \\"how-to\\" chapter on becoming a potential sportscastor is rather intimidating, but they offer helpful hints on how to get started (and to have a back-up plan in case it doesn't work out).<br /><br />But the real meat of the book is the estimation of atheletes over time. Olbermann and Patrick know their sports, and it shows in the lists they compile of \\"the greatest\\". Note to the fainthearted: Olbermann's arcane knowledge of nineteenth century baseball is mind-boggling, you may want to take a quick walk outside after poring over the lists.<br /><br />Patrick and Olbermann may no longer be a team, but their book is a great relic of that time when Sports Center truely was \\"The Big Show\\". Pick it up today, and you'll never put it down.	2004-09-10

Then again, McSweeneys has a reputation for aiming more for the brain than the funny bone, so that shouldn't be a surprise. What IS a surprise is that the amount of really good pieces outweighs the fair to not-very-good pieces.<br /><br />Among the stand-outs: the two Ezra Pound pieces (I was vaguely familiar with Pound's WWII activities, so that helps to get it), the Diary of a Cobra Recruit (haven't we all wondered if they were taught how to shoot at everything but the G.I. Joes?), The Letters to Mr. Vandwoude(sic), who refuses to be scammed out of his cash by a faux \\"orphan\\" charity, Michael Ian Black's look at why people hate him, and Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky's commentary for LOTR: The Fellowship of The Ring (no matter how you lean politically, you'll laugh your ass off).<br /><br />There are many more that, if I hadn't just gotten up, I would be able to rattle off for inclusion in the \\"stand-outs\\" section, but maybe you should go ahead and buy the book and see for yourself...<br /><br />Anyway, I read this book over a weekend, and enjoyed just about every minute of it. The one fault I give it is the section of lists at the end. That got old real quick, page after page, but there were plenty of hilarious ones to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and pick this up.

I am solidly of the first camp, though give it a few years and I might be a latter-day grouch.<br /><br />The work of Ben Yagoda brings the magazine alive, from the heyday of such luminaries as Thurber and White to the tough war years, right up through the Shawn era and even right up to (for 1999) the present. Through it all, Yagoda examines the many lives who devoted themselves to this literary exercise in humor and good faith. The most compelling character studies, however, are the two main editors throughout the magazine's history, Harold Ross and William Shawn.<br /><br />Ross, who founded the magazine in 1925 and managed it through its first twenty-six years, comes across as a gruff, thoroughly Western man who nonetheless saw the need for a magazine like \\"The New Yorker\\", and brought it to being through sheer will and fortitude. He also happened to publish significant works by James Thurber, E.B. White, and J.D. Salinger among others. Shawn, taking the reins after Ross's death in 1951, saw the magazine through 30+ years of challange and triumph, only to be forced out in 1987. Throughout the book, Yagoda makes these men the central focus of his tale, but he includes brief looks at literary and other lights of the twentieth century, some who did get published (like Donald Barthleme, Veronica Geng, and John Updike) and some who didn't (Tom Wolfe, whose scandelous expose on the magazine shook it out of its fuddiness).<br /><br />Overall, the book looks fondly back at the magazine's past, with a hint that it might never reach the same heights of importance it once had. That may very well be, but there's still something to be said for a magazine that is such an institution no one could imagine starting a writing career without considering the possibility of submitting to it.<br /><br />\\"The New Yorker\\" is still the premier magazine in America, and this book explains why, after almost a century, it still carries the weight it does.ting to it. <br /> <br />\\"The New Yorker\\" is still the premier magazine in America, and this book explains why, after almost a century, it still carries the weight it does.	2004-08-26

O'Rourke buff (the dude inspired me to start writing, which is either a good thing or bad), so I was interested to check this out. Plus, after reading Tony Hendra's book about the Lampoon and the creation of the Yearbook by Doug Kenney and O'Rourke, I decided to quit putting off my hesitancy to buying it and purchased it about two months ago. I haven't laughed as hard at anything in print since.<br /><br /> The context of the Yearbook is essential to understanding it; rather than just a &quot;hey, look how crazy we were!&quot; sort of Porky's approach, there's an underlying theme of &quot;Animal House&quot;-style anger at the authority structures that made social conformity and Vietnam possible. The writers had lived through the Vietnam era of the late Sixties, and they looked back in anger at the controls high school placed on them. There's real venom in these pages, if you know where to look.<br /><br /> But what struck me, and what made me appreciate this on the terms of being a simply good artwork, was the similarities to high school yearbooks even today. Sure, the layouts and hair/fashion styles change, but the general idea is the same: there are the popular kids, and then there's everyone else (including the &quot;hero&quot; of the piece, future Delta member Larry Kroeger). They all exist in the mythical Dacron, Ohio, and their school is really everybody's school. I can say, coming from a similarly awful school here in the great state of South Carolina, that nothing made me chuckle more than the laugh of recognition. I graduated in '97, yet I could identify and pick up on things that would've been true of any year (the snarky tribute to a fallen classmate, the peppy rememberence of a fallen President, the losing sports teams buoyed by a sense of &quot;better luck next year&quot;).<br /><br /> The yearbook is so spot on, when I went back to my senior year yearbook I could immediately see such parallels. Our football team was(still is) a walking disaster, and little good could be said for the other sports. Our school play was just as clumsy as Dacron's &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and our talent shows didn't improve much on the 'entertainment' provided by the 1964 class. It was these hilarious occurances that made me appreciate the book as simply more than a rant against the complacency of the Fifties; it was at long last a genuinely funny ghost of what it mocked.<br /><br /> I can't vouch for whether the &quot;new&quot; material takes away from the old (as this was indeed my first run-in with the parody in total), but I will say it seems a bit tame compared to what's part of the original. Plus, the &quot;literary magazine&quot; struck a chord, as I can remember my own sophmoric contribution to a similar publication in my high school (which sold about one copy, I believe). The &quot;where will they be in ten years&quot; list seemed like it could've been written by the idiots in my class, and the crude names assigned to the underclassmen (shown with the same exact photo every time) would not have been out of place in my school's tome either.<br /><br /> Overall, I enjoyed this far more than I imagined I would. There are obvious sight gags (the basketball team's hapless conduct had me in stiches), but the real meat is in the writing (whether or not O'Rourke can really claim a majority of the material, it seems a bit arrogant to take top billing over the late Kenney), which is dead-on. No matter when you graduated, you will recognize the figures in this book.

Not only good, but downright hilarious. Let me explain...<br />As someone raised on TV (but cognizant of its bland way of repackaging whatever works for one show to fill up the rest of the schedule, and other crimes), I am always wary of attempts to document the &quot;history&quot; of any particular movement in television. What's more, so much on television (especially at the time this book was released) is unworthy of being discussed in such grandiose terms that you can't help but feel books like this miss the point. Television is so ephemeral that it seems almost foolhardy to try and document it.<br />Now for the fun part, and why you should rent this from the library (save your money, folks): the now-canceled or forgotten shows that the author profiles. Sure, &quot;Living Single&quot; might have been a decent show, but it doesn't merit an entire portion of the chapter. The embrace of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; by Gen X (which thankfully, due to Owen's chronology, I don't belong to) is proof positive that they deserve all the mockery you can hoist.<br />And a serious discussion of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;? Give me a break!<br />What's also funny (at least to those of us who never cared for a certain much-hyped sitcom about twenty-somethings in New York) is the way the author lauds certain shows like &quot;Friends&quot; and how they &quot;impacted&quot; television. If by &quot;impact&quot; you mean &quot;caused other networks to rush out clones on the air and ever since try to repeat the same tired formula as a sure way of suckering the American people into watching said crap&quot;, then I guess you've got a point.<br />Web-savvy post-Gen-Xers will laugh out loud at the &quot;glossary&quot; the book provides for technical terms that have since become part and parcel of the English language. Then again, what is a &quot;world wide web&quot; anyway, right?<br />It's almost cruel of me to point out how bad this makes the Gen-Xers look, but people who offer testimony on how &quot;The Real World&quot; changed their viewing habits really deserve much worse. I remember the same Gen X tv this book documents, and it just reminds me how bad some of this garbage was.<br />Oh, and the talk about how Gen Xers &quot;demand more realistic content&quot; should serve as a bellweather for anyone looking into the reasons behind reality TV. Thanks again, Gen X.<br />If anything, this book makes you laugh when you shouldn't, with serious discussion of (among others) &quot;Models Inc.&quot;, &quot;Partners&quot;, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, and various other waste paper collecting at the bottom of TV's dustbin. I'm not saying post-Gen-X TV is all that much better (reality shows, the promotion of Paris Hilton to superstar status, etc), but at least we have &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. The greatest cultural contributions of Gen X? &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;. I believe that makes my point.<br />All in all, this book was written with good intentions, but comes off as dated and even laughably bad to anyone post-1997. The simple fact that it was published too early to document the single greatest crime of Gen X (&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; and other ripoff teen angst shows) is a point in its favor. Read it to remember, read it to laugh, read it to feel superior to your older brother or sister; anyway you slice it, you will get some enjoyment out of this.

The simple fact that it was published too early to document the single greatest crime of Gen X (&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; and other ripoff teen angst shows) is a point in its favor. Read it to remember, read it to laugh, read it to feel superior to your older brother or sister; anyway you slice it, you will get some enjoyment out of this. It might not be the kind the author had in mind, however...	2004-07-11
US	39802170	R36PGH4DLNO0FE	0375725784	381316770	A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius	Books	5	2	6	N	N	Utterly fantastic work of genius	I was unfamiliar with Dave Eggers before picking up this book. I kept seeing him named in the acknowledgements of books by Sarah Vowell and &quot;Mirth of a Nation&quot;, I knew he was editor of McSweeney's, but I had no ideas about him going into this book.<br />Overall, I think the memoir is fantastic (even staggering), with nice touches of humor, heartache, loss, growth, acceptence, death, and ultimately life. For that is what this book is about, Eggers' life. The end of his parent's lives is in a sense the beginning of his, as he is forced to take on the youngest sibling and raise him. Some would see the book as a grand egotistical tome. There is some merit to that, but the story at the heart of all the literary pyrotechnics is solid and worthy of being told.<br />What the book is mostly, to a certain degree, is a fascinating and intoxicating literary experiment, with conventions thrown out the window if they don't help the story. Eggers devises an interview he had with the producers of &quot;The Real World&quot; to frame an unconventional way of conveying more information about his hometown. He recounts his experiences as head of &quot;Might&quot; Magazine which (because I'd like to start my own magazine someday) I enjoyed immensely.<br />Growing up in the early 90s (I'm about 10 years younger than Eggers), I can appreciate the references to that time without fail. After all, this is the guy's life, these are the people he met, the things he saw, the things that influenced him.<br />All in all, I am glad I read this book. I might very well re-read it, it's truly a heartbreaking (but life-affirming) work of staggering (if a bit self-important) genius (undeniably).	2004-07-07

As such, it is a nice snapshot of the time, but doesn't give much in the way of lasting significance.<br />The travelogues to Israel and Egypt are among O'Rourke's finest foreign-correspondent pieces, but the brief look at why we went to war with Iraq seems facile and uninvolving. It may just be that I disagree with O'Rourke over the necessity of this war, but I didn't find his own criteria for why we did all that convincing. The trip through Kuwait and Iraq is illuminating in its portrait of the war some time before it really turned into a bloodshed, but offers little in the way of more than a cultural snapshot.<br />I think the chapter dealing with the anti-war protestors is a bit mixed. The war the protesters were up in arms against was Afghanistan, not Iraq, so I side with PJ on that one being the right war to engage in. But O'Rourke's overall dismissal of the protesters smacks of the same narrow-minded logic that disassociates most Republican pundits from the mainstream of American thought. If O'Rourke feels the protestors are wasting their time, he can't really offer much alternative to dispute their inherent views on the meaninglessness of war.<br />That being said, it's still an enjoyable read: The humor is crackling, and O'Rourke lets in trademark comments about how utterly stupid war is to balance out what I found as T.R.W.A.D. (Typical Republican Whining About Dissent - feel free to use that anytime). The last chapter on Iwo Jima deals with the utter senselessness of either side's will to hold or take the island. It's a sobering thought, considering what so many died for amounts to a less-than-paradisical island with little in the way of natural beauty.<br />Overall, I liked this book pretty well, even though I disagreed totally with O'Rourke's rationalizations for the crisis in Iraq. It's really up to the individual reader to determine where they stand on that issue, but it shouldn't take away from anyone's ability to enjoy this book in total. Four stars due to the haphazard way it was put together (would have worked better as a cohesive treatise on the modern state of warfare, post-9/11), and because it's over far too soon.rmine where they stand on that issue, but it shouldn't take away from anyone's ability to enjoy this book in total.

Yes, the contradictions in the review title describe the way Tony Hendra chose to do his &quot;history&quot; of Boomer humor, which he tracks down from Mort Sahl through Second City, Nichols and May, Lenny Bruce, right up to the National Lampoon and SNL. Witty, welldone, but also reaching in many respects, this is a good primer on the way humor came to shape national consciousness in the Fifties and beyond.<br />I picked up Hendra's tome for the Lampoon memoir alone (having aspirations of getting published on the web version myself) and hadn't really intended to read the first section dealing with the Fifties and so on. But I decided to do so anyway, and found it to be very interesting and essential to setting up Hendra's own time at National Lampoon.<br />There are problems I have with the book, starting with the bitching about pretty much everything P.J. O'Rourke did at the Lamp. Hendra, writing this in '87, might very well be telling the truth about his feelings towards the more successful O'Rourke, but it comes off as petty in the book. Hendra is not himself totally without fault. As a previous reviewer points out, Hendra's vehement denials and so forth seem to serve the opposite purpose of giving lie to his statements.<br />I came away from this book liking Hendra in spite of his more self-absorbed writings. In contrast to the same reviewer whom I cited earlier, I found the descriptions of the various issues of Lampoon to be fascinating (I wish I knew of a store in my area that sold old issues, just so I could see for myself). Also, the portraits that emerge of Hendra's collegues (Doug Kenney, O'Donaghue, Henry Beard, Bruce McCall, Chris Miller and even P.J. O'Rourke to an extent) show them for all their faults to be the best writers at that time for the Lampoon.<br />All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone interested in the arc of Boomer humor, or just postwar comedy in general. The railing Hendra does against TV should also be of interest to social historians, because it justifies attacks on television as being artifical (contrary to reality shows' bread and butter), and narcotic in its effects. The brief time spent on SNL was illuminating because it revealed what I felt all along: Lorne Michaels is a phony.<br />True, some will argue that Hendra's speil against Michaels and others is part of some bitterness over not being as successful as his peers. That certainly tempers the book for an informed reader, but it shouldn't distract from the fact that, while associated with the Lampoon, Hendra did some very good work that shouldn't be forgotten or tossed aside. Also, his is the only real &quot;history&quot; of the Lampoon that I would trust for an introduction.<br />So get this book if you want to learn the real meanings behind Animal House, the story of great writers like Kenney, Beard, et. al, and the contributions of Bruce and Sahl and so many others. A more expansive volume covering the period would be desired, but so far this is the best that's out there. I enjoyed it, and I hope future readers of the book will too.

O'Rourke is hands down the single funniest polticial observer in recent memory and (even though he's a Republican) very good at what he does...which is tell you why the government is so f-ed up.<br />I first read this book a little less than a year ago, and it's been probably my favorite of P.J.'s more cohesive works (of the obvious grab-bag of essays, it's either Rep Party Reptile or Age and Guile). Sure, you won't agree with everything he says (if you are of the Sean Hannity, &quot;I Must Agree With Everything The Repubs Do Because They Are Never Wrong&quot; mindset, this isn't a book for you), but you have a great time reading it. One of the other reviewers called reading this book a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;, and I think that applies well for those of us left-of-center who still like a good laugh every now and then.<br />But there's some serious stuff here too, couched between the wit: I won't repeat the words here, but his analogy concerning the drug war hyperbole is astute and saddingly accurate. The budget chapter strikes out any cash for the National Guard, as O'Rourke had friends at Kent State (in a rather weak-kneed footnote, Peej decides his budget needs revision due to the Gulf War breaking out after he wrote it, it feels tacked-on and possibly a retreat from his earlier stance).<br />Overall, this is P.J.'s best work, one that satirizes everyone in Washington who is wasting space. Written during the first Bush's administration, it's gleefully disrespectful to that era's mindset and makes you savor what bad things P.J. might have to say about the current Dumbass-in-Chief. On some levels, this is a product of its time, but it still holds up well enough to be read long after anyone remembers who the hell any of the leaders were.<br />I have to credit PJ with giving me the desire to write, and while I heartily disagree with him politically the man has common sense, and there's still a streak of libretarianism in me left over from my youth in the Republican-dominated South. This is O'Rourke's best, and it could've been written today and still say the same things. A fantastic read from a fantastic (and funny) voice in American society.epublican-dominated South.

I'm glad I did; this is one of the funniest collections of essays I've read in a while. Vowell's unique, almost Gen-X approach to life (though I hate to use the label \\"Gen-X\\", as that suggests someone much more mopey than Vowell really is). I'm perplexed by the reviews that cite this as being \\"boring\\" or \\"not funny\\", I suppose everyone's entitled to their opinion but I couldn't disagree more. Whether knock-down hilarious (\\"Take The Cannoli\\", \\"Shooting Dad\\", etc) or serious and well-thought historical and emotional (\\"What I See When I look at The Twenty-Dollar Bill\\", the Frank Sinatra-Hoboken essay), Vowell is excellent, and I look forward to reading more of her work. I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good laugh, and hopefully I'll get a chance to hear her on NPR sometime. At any rate \\"Take the Cannoli\\" is a good primer for Vowell.	2004-01-15

Inbetween that time, and between the covers of this great book, I found myself caught up in the exhiliration of victory, the agony of defeat, and a variety of emotions inbetween. Roger Angell is to baseball what Shakespeare was to theatre: he captures the wide spectrum of players and coaches, fans and managers, rookies and old pros, that have made baseball a fascinating sport to follow.<br />Individual pieces that stick out for me are the David Cone profile, the scout, Smokey Joe Wood, and many others that make this book a wonderous journey. This is for the diehard fans, to be sure, but baseball novices will also enjoy some of the many thoughtful and well-written pieces contained here. You will finish this with a deeper appreciation of baseball itself (despite its bloated state now, Angell makes no apologies for his continued interest long after other, more traditional fans have thrown up their hands in disgust. There is just as much joy in describing the Angels-Giants match-up in '02 as there is in memorializing Teddy Ballgame Williams), and Angell's work here is truly some of the finest sports reporting I've ever read. As stated in the introduction essay, Angell's work appeared mainly in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, where he could have time to construct his thoughts without the threat of a nearer deadline. Thus, his writing here does service to the majesty of the events described.<br />For the baseball fan in all of us, Roger Angell's  work is truly a gift and a joy to read. I highly recommend this work. However cynical you may be about the more recent baseball world, you will enjoy this book.	2004-01-07

Thus, when I found myself looking for some George Plimpton to read in the aftermath of his death this past September, it might seem odd I'd choose this, but I found it to be one of the best sports books (and one of the best books period) I've ever read.<br />Plimpton spends a few weeks in training with the Detroit Lions in the summer of 1963 (not 1965), trying to experience the ultimate fan's rush: to play quarterback for one of the major football teams. Plimpton's account is not limited strictly to the whys and wheres of the game. His descriptions of the society of the football players, isolated almost in a training facility that also doubles as a private school, makes for the most engrossing parts. Anyone who lived with a rowdy bunch of college buddies can't help but smile at the recounting of various shenanigans (such as spooky masks being worn to scare the rookies) that pass the time. Plimpton gets his chance in an exhibition game between the Lions squads, and realizes that not just anyone can be a star quarterback (His very ineptitude, and his willingness to share it with the reader, endears the reader to him if they haven't been already). Later on, Plimpton tries to get involved in an actual game against another team, but he can't get past the NFL hierarchy and must be content with his performance on the training field. Nonetheless, he comes out in the end wiser for his experiences, if a little bruised physically and ego-wise.<br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to even the casual fan or non-fan of football. Plimpton's wild &quot;everyman&quot; adventure would've been made into more of a publicity stunt in today's era of ESPN-dominance of the sports media, but at the time it was a foolhardy Quixote-esque attempt to experience the thrill of the professional game. This is the perfect introduction to Plimpton, and I plan to re-read this every chance I get.ead this every chance I get.	2004-01-07

Sedaris describes, through vaguely connected essays, his own often difficult battle with communication, and the insights he gains are painfully funny. A bit like an autobiography, &quot;Me Talk&quot; is layered throughout with Sedaris' bits of wisdom and wit, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I didn't find myself rolling in the floor with laughter except on a few occasions, but the book as a whole is a good look at the difficulty we all have on occasion to say what we really mean, or let people know what we're thinking. The parts about Sedaris' efforts to learn French and justifiably cited as the funniest parts, but I also enjoyed the essay dealing with his stint as a college teacher, assigning writing projects on soap operas. This is a good introduction to Sedaris, and I recommend it highly.	2003-12-30

I decided to be more generous than some of the other reviewers and give this four stars, if only because I am a fan of the site. The book seems to be sloppy and drags in quite a few places. Also, there's too much space given to setting up the &quot;shark&quot; moment; the actual moment when a show/artist/public figure jumped merits little more than a couple of sentences in the last few paragraphs. I can't help but feel this was assembled hastily, perhaps to cash in on the popularity of the site. Also, the straying from television shows, while welcome, quickly becomes dull and rather pointless.<br />However, I went ahead and gave it five stars because of the intent: documenting the point when celebrities started taking themselves too seriously. In our fame-obsessed culture, it's good to have barometers that measure the moment when a actor or show stops being &quot;normal&quot; and becomes &quot;self-important&quot;. So the book itself serves a useful function. The website deals soley with TV, so the book's excursion into other areas is thought-provoking nevermind the absence of a satisfying result. My advice is to seek out the website first (shouldn't be hard to do ;-D), and perhaps skim through this on occasion. Hopefully any subsequent JTS efforts won't come any closer to &quot;jumping the shark&quot; than this one did.	2003-12-29

I can't sleep, I haven't left the house in days, the book is keeping me from escaping, I must continue reading....<br />Okay, maybe not, but I am quite into the book as of this posting, and I can safely say that this is ESSENTIAL for any Python nut. The mere collection of photos alone is worth it. And the interviews are well-done (though some of it seems lifted almost directly from the &quot;Monty Python Speaks&quot; book of a few years back, I imagine they just haven't thought of any different ways to tell certain stories). This is the Pythons themselves, telling their story from birth to death (and yes, Python without Graham Chapman is not Python). This is the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of Python collectibles, and you won't find a better documentation of the group's history (George Perry's &quot;Life of Python&quot; is also good for those not willing to invest so much in this book, though it's much harder to find).<br />Excellent book, from an excellent bunch of guys (one of whom has ceased to be).

I have to concur with the reviews that cite the first few stories as less-than-stellar. Heavy on imagery and light on humor, the first three or four left me wondering why I bothered, but I soldiered on. I just started &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; which I plan on finishing sometime today.<br />Overall, I'd say this is probably not the best intro to Sedaris (of course, I have yet to read anything else, so take that as you will). Season's Greetings and some various other stories breathe life into the book midway through, but it's a struggle for the first forty pages. Nonetheless, I don't regret buying it, and perhaps a second time reading it will yield a more positive review.<br />Sedaris' favorite subject is himself and his relations to the world, and I like his wit when he lets it show through. If you like the biting humor of Joe Queenan, then Sedaris is right up your alley. Even though I haven't read anything else yet, I feel safe in saying this is probably not the best introduction to his work, however.	2003-11-08

Nelson's latest foray into literary humor, \\"Mike Nelson's Death Rat!\\", is one of those books that starts slow, but begins to pick up steam once the scheme of having another man stand in for the aging Pontius Feeb (and accidentially selling the story of a six-foot-rat as NON-Fiction) is hatched, and the attendant efforts of a Garrison Keillor-type (actually, the mental image I had of him was more Patrick F. McManus or that guy with the hat on \\"The Red Green Show\\") to unveil the truth.<br />I picked up this one because, as a huge MST3K and Mike Nelson fan, I looked forward to his attempt at fiction. I immensely enjoyed \\"Mind Over Matters\\" and \\"Movie Megacheese\\", so this was a bit of a no-brainer...when I finally got around to buying it, months after publication. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the novel's absurdities and thinly-veiled caricatures of various Minnesotans (Keillor, Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, Prince), and the story flowed along well.<br />Now as to why I didn't give it 5 stars: There's an element of clumsiness to the book overall, as if Nelson is trying to cram too many knick-knacks about Minnesota or the Midwest mindset to bother with any hint that readers might just not care. There were whole paragraphs which could have been excised, but what little distraction these provided was negligable overall. I think my view might be tempered by the fact that the first few chapters seemed overwrought in absurdity, and I really didn't feel comfortable with the book until about the first hundred pages or so. I have to dock it a star for that, but the book as a whole is worth it for any MST3K fans.	2003-10-25

Finally, after months of putting it off, I purchased Mr. Franken's book and finished it in the course of two days.<br />Franken takes on the spin-meisters of the right, and makes you wonder about what the a-holes on the right are so ticked off about. Apparently they are nutjobs (Ann Coulter), idiots (Sean Hannity) or bullies (Bill O'Reilly)...and that's just the hacks. The real menace are those in power, the Nixon-esque Bush Administration, and Franken elequently documents their history of lies to the American people.<br />Franken is obviously partisan to the Left, and some have taken this as a jumping-off point to accuse him of being &quot;just another liberal media pundit with an axe to grind who hates America and leaves the country's back door open for terrorists to get through&quot; and other such nonsense. The fact of the matter is Mr. Franken is an intellegent, passionate, and wonderfully funny man who doesn't like the direction his country is going on thanks to the group-think of Bush-era &quot;compassionate conservativism&quot;.<br />All in all, this is a book for anyone who can't help but wonder how the &quot;liberal&quot; media could possibly be such a threat to America's way of life. When all the BS is over, Franken and his ilk will stand as the true patriots who genuinely love their country. Coulter, Hannity, O'Reilly, and FNC will be exposed as the hypocrites and degenerates they are.	2003-10-13

Like P.J. O'Rourke, Carlson has a sense of humor, and this book serves not as yet another diatribe against &quot;the liberals&quot; who seem to be running things (The &quot;liberal media&quot; myth is a popular one, nevermind that almost all news operations are beginning to lean rightwards to counter those charges, and the most popular cable news outlet is Fox, full of rabid disgusting neanderthals).<br />The book is a nice trip through Carlson's career in a non-chronological way. You read about his many experiences as a journalist and public figure, his own brush with rape accusations, and his many tales of &quot;only in Washington&quot; shenanigans on both sides of the aisle. Carlson comes across as far more tolerant of his opposite number on the left, and even goes so far as to call James Carville one of his &quot;favorite people&quot;.<br />All in all, this is NOT a book for the Ann Coulter/Rush Limbaugh set. This is a fun read, and while I disagree with him politically, I don't feel like a hypocrite when I say he is a born storyteller. Liberals and jerks, erm, Conservatives alike, will enjoy this book.	2003-10-11

O'Rourke is equally scathing in his approach to \\"born-again\\" nutjobs as he is to \\"pinko\\" enviromentalists, and his is a style of writing I wouldn't mind trying to emulate in my own belated (and as yet unpublished) career as a writer.<br />\\"Age and Guile\\" caught my fancy because I had heard it was a collection of his pieces from over the years, and I tried to find it at the local library and various bookstores, but was unlucky in my pursuit. I ended up checking out a Books-on-Tape version of the book, read by Norman Deitz, and I was quite pleased.<br />The early material is amatuerish, to be fair, but there are nuggets of wit to be found amongst the \\"juvinelia\\". The Truth About The Sixties was actually one of my favorite parts of the book, I found it very involving and fascinating to hear. The rest of the book tickled my funny bone. I just don't have enough good things to say about this book.<br />So, I ordered it on Amazon, and I've recieved it, and it's joined my collection of P.J. O'Rourke books. A liberal at heart myself, I agree with a previous reviewer that O'Rourke celebrates individual freedom and doesn't care for those who try and take it away. I only hope I can be as good at conveying that in my own writing, he's certainly one hell of a teacher.	2003-06-07
US	39802170	R5TWT4KE1MWD6	0684834804	742968691	Robert Kennedy : His Life	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Authoritative, excellent	I read Evan Thomas' book last year, and it only deepened my admiration for the man that Robert Kennedy was, and the man that he could have been had he lived. I am no Kennedy apologists, the family had their skeletons and they hid them well (read Garry Wills' The Kennedy Imprisonment if you don't believe me), but Bobby always seemed to be the most caring of the clan, a young man made old by tragedy but rendered ageless by his death. Thomas' book does not fit into the usual pile of \\"Kennedy secrets\\" books that have littered the national libraries with unsubstantiated rumors of affairs and misdeeds, the crimes and indiscretions he reveals are backed up with documentation and personnal interviews. Thomas proves throughout the book that he is the right man for the job, as he does not excuse RFK's actions but doesn't use that as proof that somehow Kennedy was \\"evil\\" or \\"bad\\". The portrait that emerges is of a decent man who, in revolutionary times, tried his best. Sometimes he failed, sometimes he did something reprehensible, but in the end Robert Kennedy's legacy was one of active participation, trying to make the world a better place. In my opinion, RFK was a better man than his more lauded older brother, and a human being born into wealth who could easily identify with the poorest of the poor without a hint of condesencion. That's best explained in Thomas' section dealing with RFK's childhood, something that the previous RFK biographer I've read (Arthur Schlesinger) didn't quite put across. In the end, Evan Thomas' book will be the new standard by which all subsequent RFK books will be judged. An essential read.	2003-05-17

I've been on a tear of P.J. O'Rourke's books lately, starting with Republican Party Reptile and so forth. This is by far one of P.J.'s best. I'm on the other side of the coin politically (fairly liberal) myself, but P.J. usually spares no one, and I admire that (Rush and his wacko friends could learn a thing or two).<br />This book is just about how to get by if you're a bachelor. It's incredibly funny for the most part (the cooking sections should not be read if you've just ate!). This is a fantastic little book, very helpful if you plan to live like a slob or like a typical college freshman.	2003-05-11
