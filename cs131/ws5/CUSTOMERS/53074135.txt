It was hard to put down because the writing is so good and so compelling. The bottom line is there is nothing going on in this book. A seemingly ordinary life of a man and a woman and a lost cat. Soon the woman leaves, we don't know why, and by the end of the book we still don't have a clue but what a journey getting to nothing remarkable at all!!!! The writing is supurb - descriptions of seemingly ordinary events become surreal and etraordinary. I don't know why I liked this book so much - there are many many many unanswered questions and there is no plot or hardly a story line to speak of.	2005-09-17
US	53074135	R1X3IZ6KQK8IND	0446611514	309570895	Skin Tight	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Daring and great	The author is incredibly daring with his wit and humor. He writes about crooked commissioners in Miami who approve buildings on environmentally sensitive areas. I like his style of writing because he combines an old fashioned crime novel with humor and also gets a little (or a lot) of South Florida corrupt politics into the story. I'm not sure how he can get away with this and still live in South Florida but he spins a great yarn doing this. The story goes on a wild journey with an incompetent plastic surgeon and a hit man who had his hand bit off by a shark but replaced the missing hand with a weed eater. Very funny stuff if you let yourself go along with some of the outlandishness.	2005-03-22

Even though some of the story is implausible, the humor he uses to describe characters and events such as the bioligist hire by the state who loathes biology and the environment. The reading is light but it's so compelling I didn't want to put it down and was finally sorry it ended.	2005-03-15

The story of Eddie is well crafted and original. We meet Eddie as he is about to die and then travel through heaven with him interrupted every now and then by a chapter titled \\"today is Eddies birthday\\". The birthday chapters gives us more insight into a seemingly ordinary life which turns into a great love story. I loved it!!!	2004-09-29

The only problem is that his stories are boring boring boring. I picked the book up because the jacket said it was a cleverly written memoir. Well, it does contain good examples of how to tell a story and focus on just a few facts but overall this guy does not have interesting stories to tell.	2004-09-12

The story, which is typical Karen Robards, is good and the character development great. Ocassionally I was horrified by her usage of trite phrases and slang. I'm not a literary high brow but this clearly was below even my standards. Even though it was an enjoyable read I will temporarily avoid Karen Robards writing for a while because of this book.	2004-05-30

The style was a little different from past books of hers that I've read. She's trying here to write a part mystery novel, part romance fiction. The blend seems to work - at least it kept my attention. The other departure from &quot;formula Devereaux&quot; is that instead of including a storyline or two about an angel this time she introduces the devil to readers. There is good nonsensical escapism here!!!! Some may like it others may hate it. I enjoyed the read.	2003-09-25

The stories are not connected very well although they build on each other, the transitions from one story to the next are not very good but the concept works if you treat each as a standalone story. Where this novel really shines is in Vreelands descriptive prose. She excels in evoking the emotions and feelings evident in a piece of art work, even if the art is fictional. I liked the writing so well that I wished the painting existed so I could see it. The story development itself was a little disappointing but it was a surprisingly quick read.	2003-09-01

Character development is great with the shy introverted Claire and the smooth skilled Max but something breaks down in the story after Max uses Claire and disappears for several weeks. Not only is this not very plausible but when they do get back together he becomes controlling and she falls in line following along willingly. He doesn't have a girlfriend anymore, she becomes his pet dog.	2003-06-19

To learn the photoshop basics go get the Classroom in a book series by Adobe. After you know the basics this book then adds considerably. It also works well as a reference because, as the author notes, you can jump in anywhere and learn a technique about some aspect of the program. I highly recommend this book but not till AFTER you learn Photoshop elsewhere.	2003-06-19

The photography as always is the best there is. I wish they would stop fooling around with the title of this book - every year it seems to change. I believe Time Life thinks they're trying to simplify the title, i.e. is this a book of year 2001 photos or 2002 photos? They have only succeeded in [messing] the title up further. Nonetheless, whatever they call it, this is a great review of photos of the past year - definitely a \\"keeper\\". Someday they'll even settle on a name for the book!!!!	2003-05-27

I read some of the other reviewer comments about how this is not the Romance they were looking for. The writing is a little different for a Jude Devereaux novel but that same great character development and story building that I've come to expect of a Devereaux book are all here. The ending is not a surprise but the twists and turns to get to the happy ending are a little different and make a good read. I enjoyed it page after page until the end. It's too bad the book ended. The big brown library cart (UPS) just delivered another Devereaux novel from Amazon as I was writing this - I can't wait.	2003-05-27

Once I started this book I couldn't stop reading - the character development is excellent, the story keeps moving along and the ending is a suspenseful surprise even though it may be a little lame. The idea of a ghost or spirit moving throughout the story is a neat twist to Karen Robards normal writings. This book is a good read!	2003-02-26

I enjoyed the premise and laughed at some of Michael the angels failings. The only thing i didn't like about this book was the hurried up ending. The book moves along enjoyably with nice banter between the characters and some humor but then it was almost as if the author decided it was time to end it so she quickly wraps it up and ends the story with two chapters of epilogues. Despite this weird ending I enjoyed the book.	2003-02-21

The pace starts off slow with &quot;the list&quot; and the media attention it garners but then really picks up when the list authors start getting murdered. This is a great story if you can ignore the fact that a list like this would hardly raise an eyebrow let alone get nationwide media attention.	2003-02-14

I was interested in more background info and details. We walked down the Main St of town and thought \\"this is nice\\" but not very practical. Practical is shopping in [local store] and buying groceries in[local store]. The days of the corner grocer and little hardware store on Main St are long gone so I was curious about the opinions of the author and his neighbors. This is a great story - it seems to be unbiased and does provide good background info on the town without making it boring. The author nicely weaves little stories about the town or tales of the neighbors into this \\"documentary\\" to keep the story moving. I know this book is not for everybody but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It's also a great commentary on planned communities in general although I'm not sure that was what the authors intended.	2003-01-31

I wanted to identify some of the trees that we see on our annual vacations to Florida over the years and this book did the trick.

I finished it in one sitting - not because I intended to but because this book is very small with lots of blank pages between chapters. As skimpy as this book looks on the outside it's even skimpier once you get inside. This is not a complaint - a few well crafted sentences can go a long way as is proven by Evans. This is more like a short story than a novel. The writing is excellent and the story heartwarming. I read the Carousel by Mr Evans first and liked it so much I went back looking for the Christmas Box to see what it was all about. I wasn't disappointed! I'm looking forward to many more great stories by this author.	2003-01-28

That style is certainly evident here but the stories don't have much development which is not like some of her past writing.

The style of writing is great and while I'm not a puritan, I do appreciate the fact that Evans keeps it clean without a lot of gratuitous sex or bad language that seems to be creeping into everything nowadays. I noticed one of the \\"professional\\" reviewers said it's not the great American novel but I heartily recommend this book as a nice read.	2003-01-12

It reads like a combination of a Nicholas Sparks novel and also &quot;A Year in Provence&quot; however in this case we spend the time in Italy with lush descriptions of life in Tuscany instead of France. The story is nicely crafted as well with all the essentials of a good novel: conflict, love, great descriptive writing and some meaning of life thrown in as well.

I didn't think I would like this type of book but the author did a nice job in drawing me into it and feeling bad for the murdered 14 year old. I also admit to reading this because of the great words it received from the Good Morning America hosts - their comments were right on. I read some of the other reviews on here AFTER reading the book and they seem to be all over the place from love to hate, so I guess it depends on your tastes. I enjoyed the creative aspects of presenting the narrative from the viewpoint of heaven. Even the description of what heaven is like was a little creative - &quot;it's different for each person&quot;.  This author did a nice job of descriptive writing although the editing in places is a little rough and could use a grammatical clean up. Can't wait to read more by Seybold. Lovely Bones is on my top ten list of great books for this year.	2002-12-28

The grammar is horrible - many sentences have words missing or words used incorrectly making it a hard read for anybody. Since this is a computer  book and literary expectations are usually low enough I should instead  focus on the content. There are many better books on configuring Linux. I'm  sure the author has competent Linux skills but like the poor writing, the  presentation of those skills is lacking. This book is a blackeye for any  publisher that would allow something like this to escape editing.	2000-06-29
