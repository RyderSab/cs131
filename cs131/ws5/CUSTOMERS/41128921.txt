The beginning does a good job of outlining various ethical frameworks.  Later, various types of problems faced by businesses are described and then placed into broad fundamental categories.  Finally, these categories are then analyzed using the various ethical frameworks described earlier in the book. <br /> <br />Each chapter has an ethical case study, where the principles of the chapter are highlighted for discussion and analysis.  The authors have an obvious pro-business bias (of course), so the importance of business as a social entity is just assumed. <br /> <br />Overall, this book does a pretty good.	2005-09-17

The main character is just a self-interested person who thinks nothing of comitting felonies.  It is amazing that Morelli, the man she is after, falls for her.  She would sell him out for a dime, yet he finds her irresitable.  She judges all these criminals as getting what they deseve, but thinks nothing of comitting crimes herself.  The fact that such a self-interested person is the heroine is a sad commentary on our times.	2005-09-17

It was a decent chronicle of the 101st's invasion of Iraq.  However, it focused mostly on the strategy of the war and not the actual execution.  It would have been nice to know what was going on at the lower levels of command.  Also, the vocabulary was a bit obscure.  I found it to be a little intellectually elitist.  Finally, he should probably have kept his political digs out of the book.  For instance, he comments that WMD have not been found.  Iraq is a big place and they still might be found.  Even if there are none, it just seems to be an out of place commentary.	2005-04-26

When he does offer solutions, I was left wondering, \\"Just how is that supposed to work?\\"  This book is definitely worth reading because it provides a new perspective on business. <br /> <br />I think Hawken raises some important questions in his book, and I wish more business people would read it.	2005-02-20

The author engages in a detailed analysis of Bush by looking at how Bush speaks.  While other books use fact manipulation and anecdotal evidence, this book uses the language strait out of Bush's mouth.  One aspect of this book that is particularly helpful is that when quotes are used, they are large enough to provide a context for what is being said.

The main focus, however, is on former Secretary of Treasury, Paul O'Neill.  By chronicling O'Neill's time as Secretary, Suskind sheds light onto how the administration made decisions, set policy, and operated on a daily basis.  This book is not as scathing as was portrayed by the press when it was released and I appreciated that.  It present a seemingly fair representation of what went on while O'Neill was Secretary.  This book sheds useful light on the basics of macroeconomics, foreign policy, and tax theory.  It is worth the read even if you are a Bush supporter; because it isn't too scathing and provides a lot of insight into politics.	2004-06-06

I read this book cover to cover, but you don't need to.  Each of his trips is a separate chapter.  I would definitely recommend reading the first two Alaska trips; it is during these trips that he is learning about adventure touring and he has the most interesting experiences (from a riding standpoint).

While this book might be useful for writers, it is entertaining enough that non-writers will enjoy reading it.  Her explanations are humorous and easy to understand.  There are two reasons that I didn't give it five stars.  The first, and she admits this, the book is prescriptive, but dictionaries are descriptive.  So, she is stating how words should be used, rather than how they are used.  Strict adherence to her definitions could cause some confusion (but she usually points this out).  The second reason is some of her definitions are not completely accurate (e.g., Glatzer states that presumption and assumption are the same.  They are not.  You need reliable evidence before you can make a presumption.  No evidence is needed for an assumption.).<br />Overall, I found this book quite enjoyable and would recommend it to others.	2004-02-25

They do a thorough job of exposing the lies and manipulation used by the Bush administration to \\"sell\\" the war against Iraq.  The authors chronicle every thing from the administration's intent to conduct a regime change when Bush first took office to the administration's ignoring critical evidence that tended to show that Iraq was not a threat to the US.  The authors are careful in this book not to take sides or claim that the US should not have gone to war.  All they do is point out the evidence that was in existence and how it was used (including the fabrication of evidence).  This book presents a balanced look at the pre-war media campaign; however, if you were a staunch supporter of the war, then you'll probably think this book is just a bunch of liberal crap.	2004-01-25

It deals with Anne's life after returning to Avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college.  Seeing Anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad.  It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first).  Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change).

She does this three times in three different places.  Each time she fails (or concludes that one could not get ahead).  The problems she encounters include finding affordable housing, paying for food and clothing, and finally paying for healthcare (even if it is over the counter stuff).  She finds the ordeal very trying and needs to &quot;cheat&quot; a couple of times by going back to her real home for a night.  The fact that an educated person with every advantage couldn't make it, is a very stong statement as to how difficult the poor in this country have it.  I don't think this book is meant to speak for the poor, rather I think it is meant to give the middle class a glance into how difficult the poor have today.  If nothing else this book might help dispel some of the typical stereotypes about the poor.	2003-10-25

I assume that he does not use the same &quot;lying tactics&quot; that he hammers the right for doing.  This book will confirm the feelings of many leftist or even centrist readers, but it will not pursuade people who are sympathetic to the right.  His humor (which is at times insulting to the right) will probably turn off some readers who will focus on his &quot;character attacks&quot; rather than the facts he is presenting.  Finally, there were times in the book when I did not know if he was serious or not, because of the sarcastic way he presented some issues.  Overall I think this book is an outstanding well crafted indictment of some of the right's more vocal ( and apparently lying) pundits.	2003-10-16

This book is very detialed in the descriptions of the bullfights.

In addition, I think more explanations of the questions the philosophers are trying to answer would be more helpful.  It seemed that this book highlighted the answers of the individual philosophers without really explaining the questions they were trying to answer.  However, I found that some of the questions were revealed when the book had a comic strip describe how another philosopher answered the same question.  I did enjoy reading this book though, and after reading this I feel that I have a much better grasp of philosophy.<br />On a syntax note, the author of the book used UK english (e.g. labor is written labour), so I got thrown off a few times, thinking there was a typo.	2003-09-27

Books	3	3	5	N	N	Very Entertaining, But Very Biased	I was really looking forward to reading this book.  I thought it would provide witty, insightful political commentary.  Boy was I wrong!  While I did find the book mildly amusing, I can't but hope that all Moore intended with this book was to entertain.  His \\"commentary\\" was inconsistent and often examined facts out of context so he could make his point (as far as I could tell his point was all men except Ralph Nader are bad). <br />An example of his fact twisting is he discusses how horrible it is that certain corporate executives charged with releasing cancer causing agents into the air basically have the charges dropped by the Justice Dept (headed by Ashcroft) because they were campaign contributors to Bush.  He then compares these executives to a person who impersonated Tiger Woods and was charged with theft and perjury.  This person was given 200 yrs to life.  But, at the very end of the comparison he adds an important fact - that this person was convicted under California's 3 strikes law.  This means that he had committed 2 prior FELONIES before the Woods impersonation.  I certainly think that the executives should not get away with what they did, and I do not support the dumping of toxins into the environment, but I also support getting career criminals off of the street.  Anyway, I feel Moore's point of social injustice loses a lot of its merit when he reveals the 3 strikes law was the reason for the huge sentence (and he never explicitly reveals that the person had committed 2 prior felonies).  It is this type of fact manipulation that he uses to make his point.<br />Also, his playing with the facts made me wonder, what is he not telling me when he makes his claims?  For instance he attacks Clinton for having the number of people who had health insurance decrease during the 8 yrs he was in office.  He never mentions that Clinton tried to get a universal healthcare bill passed.<br />In his criticism of Presidents past and present, he seems to ignore the factthat the President is not a dictator who can do whatever he wants.  He never mentions that the President has to deal with this little branch of the government called congress, and ultimately congress has to have a majority vote for legislation to pass.<br />He also resorts low blows.  He points out in the book that George W. Bush's grandfather had business dealings with the Nazis.  This fact while it may be interesting, it has no bearing on Bush's ability to be President, or even indicates what type of person Bush is (we all have family members that have done things we don?t approve of).  Moore gives off the feeling that he is resorting to an \\"...oh yeah well you mother is a ______,\\" sort of reasoning.  There are plenty of other things to criticize about Bush; he does not need to result to things that are out of George W's control and happened 2 generations ago.<br />Finally, he resorts to positional arguments - all of the other side's ideas are bad, and all of my side's ideas are good.  He criticizes Democrats for ever voting for a \\"Republican\\" piece of legislation.  He reduces politics to an \\"us\\" against \\"them\\" game.  He never considers that maybe the \\"Republican\\" legislation is in the best interest of everybody.  I find this type of we know everything and you know nothing argument to be a put-off.<br />I was really disappointed with this book.  He has many criticisms, but never offers any serious solutions (at least I hope they aren?t serious).  Unless someone who?s opinion you trust recommends this book, I would skip reading it.  There are plenty of well-written funny books offering political and social commentary (Molly Ivins has written several).	2003-09-16

Mowat's writing has an exquisite simplicity to it.  His entire experiences in the Arctic with wolves is facinating.  I must admit that I did find some of the events unbelievable, but that could just be due to my preconceptions about wolves in general (the very types he is trying to dispel).  However, for me, these unbelievable moments did not detract from the narrative in any way; I still found myself wanting to know what happened next.  In my own mind while reading the book, I couldn't help but consider how our negative stereotypes of wolves are very similar to the negative stereotypes people often feel about other groups of people.  In both cases, when one begins to truly know the other, he finds that there is really no basis for the negative sterotype.  Mowat makes it point not to rely on anecdotal evidence when studying the wolf, and instead only gives merit to the anecdotal evidence after he has observed behavior that would back it up.  It would seem that this should apply when judging people as well.<br />The only improvement I think could be made to this book is for Mowat to include whatever became of his report.  I realize he is telling the story to reveal his own experiences with the Arctic Wolves, and not to reveal the post report offical government position; but it woud have been nice to have that included anyway.<br />Overall, I think this is a great book, and well worth the few hours it takes to read it.	2003-09-12
US	41128921	R2W187A6F4TAGJ	0374129983	647099960	The Corrections	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Modern Book for Modern Times	This is definitely a book for modern times.  Every character was disfunctional.  Because of this I found myself wanting some type of retrobution to punish them.  However, it took me a while to understand that the very actions that made me dislike the characters were a result of the type of punishment I thought life should throw their way.  Until I reazlized this I just wanted to get to the end of the story.  There was one supporting character (Caroline) who was so deceitful, that reading any part of the book with her in it made me hate the story.  However, I must admit that it takes truly great writing to elicit these types of emotions (Caroline manipulated her husband and used their kids against him).  I am sure many readers will be able to relate in some way to at least one of the characters (everyone's family has some level of disfunction).  If you have trouble as I did with the book, I can assure you that the ending is worth it.  If I had to rate the book based soley based on the ending I would definitely give it 5 stars.  In the end Franzen pulls the story together extremely well.  The characters find out that many of the assumptions they held about each other were false.  It was these false assumptions that helped shape each character into who they were.  Anyway, with out giving anything away, Franzen ties everything up masterfully.<br />On a technical note, I found that I needed to keep the dictionary next to me while reading the book.  Also, there were many references both literary and historical that I did not know.	2003-09-10
US	41128921	RPZXLCFC10Z0E	0395957990	548440687	Roverandom	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Delightful Children's Story	This is a great children's story.  As is stated in the introduction, Tolkien created this story about a dog for one of his sons, when he lost his toy dog.  The dog in this story (Rover) goes on many fantasy adventures.  On his adventures, Rover encounters wizards, and mermaids, and other magical creatures.  Throughout the tale Rover is trying to get back to a young boy he met on one of his adventures.  The vocabulary in this book is occasionally a little advanced for a young reader.  Tolkien always believed in challenging young readers, he felt this is how they got better.  Also present are some familiar Tolkien themes, such as a negative portrayal of technology.	2003-09-01

I ended up enjoyed the book so much that I read it in one sitting. He does a great job of conveying the loss of control and despair experienced by William (the main character and narrator). I was impressed with the use of dialogue in the development of the story. This book is definitely worth reading regardless of who the author is.	2003-08-29

Bush's Education Policies Will Affect Your Children and Our Schools	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Made me think	This book is published by Kaplan (a test prep company) so it obviously presents testing in a very favorable light. While I disagreed with a lot of what was in the book, it did make me think. The book makes the great arguement that while test may be very subjective and test scores may be used improperly, testing is probably the best way to make sure our children are learning what we want them to learn. The author clearly points out that testing is by no means perfect, but then poses the question what would a better alternative be. This book while being biased is at least thought provoking.	2003-08-29

There are many newer drinks that are not mentioned. Unfortionately, many of the guides that have a more complete drink list do not have as much peripheral information. This book is really good at helping a person set up their own home bar. It also has little fun facts about alcohol and toasts from around the world.	2003-08-29

I really appreciated the personal and emotional impact of what the author was experiencing. Part of what makes this book so captivating, is that Wiesel doesn't just list all of the attrocities that he experienced. Rather, he focuses mainly on the physical and emotional impact of living in a concetration camp. Wiesel takes the reader through a journey that starts with his steadfast belief, then through his loss of faith and lastly to his eventual dispair. Finally, his inner struggle concerning his father is very revealing of the human condition when pushed beyond all limits.	2003-08-29

After reading this book, nothing about Bush shocks me, but I was constantly amazed by things like Bush's catering to the rich, lack of desire to read, and mysterious missing year from his military service. Hovever, this book is definitely too scathing to change anyone's mind. The author definitely has an agenda in wrtting this book (he admits to this), so it is difficult to determine what is real and what isn't. The author's bias really somes to light when he is discussing the ballpark financing. Begala fails to mention that municpal bonds are a very common way of financing new stadiums. Begala makes it seem as if the only time this has ever occured is when Bush did it.<BR>More generally, the arguements are good, but the author's sarcasm will probably close the ears of more moderate readers. For a better writen book on the pre-presidential Bush, I would suggest Shrub by Molly Ivans.	2003-08-29

I found this book to be very complete.  Even two building towns where you can just buy gas and eat are mentioned in this guide.  It contains most of the &quot;necessary&quot; maps within its pages, but I would recommend buying a map devoted to the area in which you plan to go.  I found this book to be up to date, but I have spent the most time in the northwest part of Baja.  I also own the Lonely Planet guide to Baja and I much prefer the Moon's guide (mainly because in my experience it is more complete).<BR>The format of the guide is also very easy to use.  The information is laid out in a very logical format.  You can just look through the book to find something to do in the area you are going, rather than needing to know what you want to do and then finding out where you can do it.	2003-08-29

If cutting, pasting, basic formatting, or creating VERY simple formulas is all you need to do then this book is fine. However, if you are trying to do anything more complicated forget using this book. For instance, the section on creating Macros wasn't very detailed. In addition, the book is completely missing any explanation of how to use the more complicated formula functions (there is no mention of how to do any of the statistical functions). Probably 80% of what an average user needs is in this book. But for anything beyond the basics, forget it; you'll need another reference.	2003-08-29

Most of the info contained in the first 3 chapters a business person would not need to know; or if they did they, would probably have a corporate attorney that could tell them. The book does a very poor job at explaining some of the financial examples. I have an MBA, and I still got lost at times! This book should be considered 2 books in one volume (first 3 chapters for the legal profession, last 2 chapters for the business world).	2003-08-29

It covers almost all aspects of trading and Wall Street a person would need to know. With just a couple of exceptions, the examples were extremely easy to understand. The one draw back to this book is its age. Some of the info in the book is no longer applicable due to the rapidly changing global economy, and it does not cover internet trading.

The short stories are written in the older style of Allen's humor.  They are funny because Allen is constantly using unexpected silly plot twists.  I found these silly twists to be a bit much at times.  However, if you like his older movies then you will probably like the way he writes the short stories.  The plays were, I thought, much more clever.  They were still silly (of course) but they had more continuity than the short stories.  In addition the unexpected still occurred frequently but it seems more in context, in the plays.<br />Regardless, this book is very funny and if you like Allen's movies, then you'll definitely find this book funny as well.	2003-08-28
