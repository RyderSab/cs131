You're gonna think Keith bought my vote on this one, but I assure you he didn't.  This book clearly shows how much DeCandido adores both Star Trek and The West Wing, and how his bottomless pit of Trek knowledge served him well by giving him the foundation he needed to build a strong, believable story about the politics of the Federation.  (You should realize that not everyone could write a story like this.  In fact, Keith may be the *only* one, and if you've ever had the opportunity to hear him spouting Trek trivia, you'd understand what I'm talkin' about.)<br /><br />There are no space battles here, so if that's what you're after, you're gonna need to look elsewhere.  Instead, here is a highly-entertaining book full of the complicated political hubbub we LOVE about The West Wing, folded seemlessly into the Star Trek universe - without losing a single thread from either.  (Shout out for Nan's \\"Big Block of Cheese Day,\\" there, too, Keith.  Well done.)	2005-08-15

Oh, the beauty of the backstory, the prequel, the whatEVER you want to call it, especially when it comes to novel vs. television.  It gives a writer a goodly amount of space to supply the characters with all the depth and strange habits that make for meaty personalities - something TV viewers might have to wait a long time to see, if they *ever* get to.  And, as has been the case with pretty much every one of Keith DeCandido's novels, the man doesn't disappoint, providing us an excellent and plausible look at how it came to be that Beka Valentine should rescue Dylan Hunt in the pilot episode of \\"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda.\\"  Of course, now I really wanna go back and watch that pilot again, armed with this new information.

That these were stories written *prior* to the characters' becoming a team on Excalibur did, I suppose, lessen the pressure, but still, it was a task that couldn't have been done without minding the 'future' David's already written.  Each author picked a character and wrote a story - and each did so with flair, not some little humor, plenty of continuity, and an obvious love of the New Frontier universe in the first place.<br /><br />I noticed one or two errors that smacked of haste in putting this book together, but those in no way diminished the overall enjoyment of it. Go ahead and buy this book - and then test your mettle at next year's Shore Leave convention by getting as many authors as you can to autograph the thing!	2004-07-28

I struggled through the first 75 pages, and then even skipped ahead to the Monica stuff (page 439) in a desperate effort to find something readable.  Nope.<br />Okay, this isn't a spy novel or my precious Star Trek, but I expected at least *some* daring writing.  Not a word.  In fact, the only three bright spots I noticed were: 1) The photos, 2) A few pages describing getting Chelsea to Stanford (pages 419-421), and 3) Five paragraphs on page 438 about the \\"swimsuit photo.\\"  Beyond that, I wouldn't know, because that's about all I read.<br />The Acknowledgements are 6 pages long, and the Index is 28 pages!

I believe I've said this already, but I think this S.C.E. idea was about the best ever (you GO, DeCandido!), and this next batch was no exception to that idea.  Waiting for the paperbacks puts me woefully behind the eBooks, this I know, but my patience has been consistently rewarded with each new publication.<br />In Book Three, we get eBook stories 9-12, and each one is a separate little thrill ride into the S.C.E. universe.  And I guess what I'm most impressed with is the continuity of character development and growth throughout each author's writing.  That can't be an easy task, especially when the authors are also charged with writing a compelling plot.<br />If you're like me and don't really care for the eBook format, but are interested in learning about the Starfleet team that goes in to clean up the messes, I *highly* recommend these books.  Fast-paced but complex, with great character development and depth.<br />Good job, I say!  Don't stop!	2003-06-29

I recalled seeing Susan Garrett a number of years ago at Shore Leave, but, like a dunce, I did not purchase her book at that time and have it autographed.  (Hope springs eternal that she will return someday to Shore Leave.)<br />As to the story itself, well, as we know, Detective Knight has been searching for, what, 800 years, for a way to regain his mortality.  He is given quite an interesting way in this finely-written novel - but these things never come without a price.  I found the storyline difficult to follow at first, but once I got the hang of it, it proved to be incredibly intense and very, very clever.  Whether you buy from the bookstore or from the Goodwill, go ahead and get yourself a copy.  You won't be disappointed.<br />And in the meantime, I'll watch for Geraint Wyn Davies in the SciFi Channel's new show, \\"Tracker.\\"	2003-01-17

And that's the whole point of this effort, I believe:  To lengthen and re-shape characters and situations, *not* to have them lie fallow in our memories, but to continue to move forward into events that might not have fit the mold a few years ago.<br />For one, the idea of Bajor actually becoming part of the Federation was like a pipe dream when the show was airing - a dream not everyone embraced.  Now it's a reality, but this brings a new reality to people like Kira, Ro, and Quark, as well - and still, as you would expect, the idea of Bajor being part of the UFP has not been welcomed by everyone.<br />As for the Defiant's mission in the Gamma Quadrant, I can only say here is where the book's title really hits home.  Three (well, four) crewmembers are decidedly changed after being scanned by an alien artifact, and what they must go through to return to their former selves involves leaps of faith and trust that you or I might never dare to attempt.<br />And throughout this novel are hints and whispers of things to come that tug uneasily at the heartstrings.  Too sappy for you?  Too bad!  You're missing a good series if you're not reading this one.	2002-11-06

I think I'll provide the gut-response review, and leave the more cerebral efforts to other reviewers.<br />And what does my gut say?  WELL DONE!<br />The biggest advantage I see, not only in this novel, but with the re-launch itself, is the fact that things can happen without the worry that the next television episode will turn a well-written story into an a/u.  I know, I know, the pro novels were never meant to follow canon, but there were always constraints - constraints that are absent from this series.<br />While some events in this novel are similar in many ways to events I've read in other Trek novels, at no other time has my heart entered in so fully.  That's not to say there's not a goodly amount of destruction and betrayal, but the moments that resonant for me are the ones that involve the tragedies and triumphs of the heart.  I speak of Andorian bondmates, a young woman's posthumous gift of peace, and baseballs in the forest.<br />Applause, applause to Heather Jarman in her first pro effort (though I've  read her before, but I won't say where) and look forward with great expectation to the next in this series.  In fact, I look forward to more pro stuff from Heather, too.	2002-10-07

And if you're *not* a fan, I'd recommend you become one, if for no other reason than to read pro Trek that's out from under the contraints of television canon.  Imagine, no pesky demographics getting in the way of decent (and multiple) plotlines.  It's so *refreshing*!<br />While it may be true you could be lost if you start with this book, I'll betcha you'll go back to the beginning of the re-launch if you *do* decide to start here.<br />&quot;Twilight&quot; (the first in a series of four called &quot;Mission Gamma&quot;) sets a number of scenes involving our favorites from DS9, plus a few others who were introduced earlier.  To me, this is a face-paced and meaty story, with just the right mix of space battles and character development - exactly the way I like my Star Trek.  Some story lines are resolved in this novel, but others will be carried into future books, which is as it should be.  Kira's holding down the fort on DS9, while Vaughn is on the Defiant, exploring the Gamma Quadrant.  To say anything more would be giving away too much.<br />David R. George's writing style has been described by another reviewer as &quot;extraordinarily rich in descriptive narrative,&quot; and I quite agree.  He's easy on the eye and the mind - though I *did* add a number of words to my vocabulary with this book.<br />In reading over the other reviews, I see many who are gagging over the budding romance between Ro and Quark.  But I think it's just one more example of the beauty of this whole re-launch thing.  Heck, having Ro on the station *at all* is more than we'd probably ever see on TV - at least a Ro with Michelle Forbes' face, which is how I'll always picture her.  So I'll take Ro/Quark as part of the whole that is &quot;Mission Gamma&quot; and keep on reading!  Besides, I've seen odder couples in my life, so why should I think something in fiction is so farfetched?  They say love is blind, after all, and if you read this book, you may discover Ro and Quark have more in common than you might think.<br />There is also a tiny sub-plot about Kasidy Yates, as she waits alone on Bajor for the birth of her child.  She's also trying to come to terms with being the wife of the Emissary, which isn't easy without Ben *or* Jake to support her.  I'm glad Kasidy's been included in the re-launch.  Hers was the story I really wanted to see resolved - or at least continued - and I'm glad to see it happening here.if you read this book, you may discover Ro and Quark have more in common than you might think.<br />There is also a tiny sub-plot about Kasidy Yates, as she waits alone on Bajor for the birth of her child.

(On to my review.)<br />After having just read \\"A Hard Rain,\\" I can only say I'm glad I saved this one for last.  This was one story that needed to be told.  It's fast-paced and meaty, and packed with real-life decisions and hard truths about less-than-ethical compromises that must be made in times of war.<br />Though this is going to sound perfectly ridiculous, the one thing that satisfied me the most had nothing to do with the battle but with a bit of continuity I applaud:  We learn about the existence of Barin, Deanna's two-and-a-half year old half-brother.<br />...And this time, halleluia, the cover art *does* have something to do with the plot!	2002-06-12

I got myself through this book, only because I kept thinking the next page would draw me in.  But it never did.  Nothing flowed very well, and about the only thing that really held my interest were the essays by the authors at the end.<br />But try as I might, I simply could not envision the inside of this Sphere or what was happening to it, and the story narrative did nothing to help, nevermind the stilted, choppy dialogue.<br />And Scotty, where the heck was Scotty??!!!  Too many mentions of his poor ship, but no sign of my favorite engineer.  I didn't check the timeline, so I don't know if he was already with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers by the time this book was written, but maybe not.  Doesn't matter, he should have been part of this story.  Heck, the S.C.E. should have been here, not the Enterprise!<br />If you ask me, the only characters with any depth at all were made of rock.  Better you simply watch the TNG episode, \\"Relics,\\" and be done with it.	2002-06-12

I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting from this novel, but I'm pretty sure it didn't live up to my expectations, if that makes any sense.  Dean Wesley Smith is one of my favorites, and the book's certainly written in his familiar style, but I think he fell short of the mark on this one.  I kept waiting for the story to grip me, but it never did, and I figured it out way before Dix did.<br />I did, however, LOVE the cover.  As I have said in the past, I *do* buy books for their covers, and having met the artist, Sonia Hillios, at Shore Leave at the very time she had finished painting this one, well, I just had to have it when I saw it for sale.<br />But unless you simply must have a complete set of TNG paperbacks or adore the covers like I do, you can skip this one and not be any worse for it.<br />That having been said, I hope Dean gets a chance to try again, because I like the idea of Dixon Hill, and I'm sure Dean does, too.	2002-05-08

You might also want to do the same for the TNG episode, &quot;Measure of a Man,&quot; just so you'll have a better list of who's who for this novel.  (Of course, I only had to go as far as the ruthlessly-organized bookshelf upstairs for my tape of &quot;Measure of a Man,&quot; but that's something else entirely.)  It's *very* satisfying the way this novel ties these continuity threads together, while at the same time providuing character...growth and change, shall we say?<br />As I glanced over the other reviews, I noticed Joshua Macy's first paragraph - with his comments about it being a mystery, a meditation on immortality, a romance (yup, *romance*), and a bang-up sci-fi adventure all rolled into one - pretty much sums it up, including that part about giving him the shivers.<br />There was a hauntingly-delicious moment for me, very near the end, when Data comes to understand why Picard insisted he not deactiviate his emotion chip.  If it were anyone else, you might yawn with the obviousness, but it's not anyone else - it's *Data.*  He's not supposed to come to these kinds of understandings.<br />Is he?<br />I'd say this book is worth it just for that, but it's not.  It's worth it for FAR more.  Go with your gut:  read this one.	2002-03-01

I can't say much in this review of Book 2 of the Starfleet Corps of Engineers that I didn't already say in my review of Book 1.  That is, it's great!  Well-written, believable, and very entertaining, with nods to continuity throughout.  If you're not reading these, or the DS9 re-launch, then you're missing out on some great stuff.<br />An added bonus in the back of this publication is the S.C.E. Minipedia, written by one of the good ones, Keith R.A. DeCandido.  Set up like the Star Trek Encyclopedia, it contains all you'll need to know and more about the persons, places, and things in the S.C.E. universe, which includes, of course, plenty of the canon stuff we've come to know and love.  And for those of you who favor nitpicking, there's an e-mail address where you are invited to send in errors, corrections, or comments if you wish.<br />Win-win, if you ask me.	2002-02-20

Can't say enough about what a good idea was the Starfleet Corps of Engineers.  Heck, since the beginning - since *before* the beginning - even *I've* loved the engineers, and my life is so far removed from engineering as to be laughable, nevermind the fact that I couldn't write technobabble if you paid me.<br />But I'll tell you what, the adventures they find themselves in make for highly entertaining reading.  And the beautiful thing about it is, there really could be no *end* to the adventures.  Certainly, there's going to be an S.C.E., and even more certainly, there's always going to be a situation or two where they will be sorely needed.<br />In this, the first of the eBooks in print, we get four very different stories from five different authors, including three of my all-time favorites:  Christie Golden, Keith R.A. DeCandido, and Dean Wesley Smith.  We are introduced to the flagship of the S.C.E., the *da Vinci,* and its intrepid crew, which includes, in a wonderful nod to continuity, Sonya Gomez, the painfully-green ensign from The Next Generation, who unceremoniously spilled hot chocolate all over Captain Picard in the teaser of the episode, &quot;Q Who.&quot;<br />In the ensuing decade or so, Ensign Gomez did, of course, mature into Commander Gomez, first officer aboard the *da Vinci.*  As such, she does her job very, very well.  This, however, makes little difference to those around her, who still tease her at every opportunity about what has come to be known as &quot;the incident.&quot;  The fact that this is carried over at all is one of the reasons the S.C.E. is so believable.  You already feel as though you *know* these people - that the S.C.E. has simply always been there.<br />I'll leave it to other reviewers to tell you about the rest of the crew or describe the specific adventures if they so desire.  As for me, I'll just say I'm LOVING these stories.  I've already bought Book 2 and look forward to future editions.	2002-02-17

I call this story a bridge, because that's exactly what it is.  Aside from McHenry, we don't see a lot of forward movement for any of the characters.  But without this story, we couldn't easily get from the events of &quot;Restoration&quot; and &quot;Cold Wars&quot; to the *next* one.  I only hope #13 comes out soon - and preferably *not* in hardback!<br />If you're following the NF bunch, you already know McHenry was an odd duck, but this story will give you the real dirt on his past.  If you enjoy it when a writer takes a thread from TOS past and sews it into the present, then you'll just adore Mark's backstory.  Heck, even if you don't care for that sort of thing, you'll still like the story.  It'll even answer a question or two about McHenry's abilities in a past NF novel.<br />Much else is resolved and some things more thoroughly explained herein, but don't let that worry you that the end is near.  Not hardly.  Be on the lookout for more about Our Favorite Brikar, Calhoun's adopted son, Moke, and the quicksilver offspring of Burgoyne and Selar.  Oh, did I mention Si Cwan and Kalinda?  No?  Well, if you think *everything* has been resolved with McHenry, I'd say think again.	2002-02-03

Feels like I've been all over the map with my reading of the New Frontier novels.  I went through the first ten paperbacks like gangbusters a number of years ago, and then lost interest when this particular installation came out in hardback (another evil marketing ploy).  I read Calhoun's \\"Captain's Table\\" and \\"Gateways\\" stories, plus six or seven (or eight or nine) other Trek novels till I came across this in the library and decided \\"what the heck?\\"<br />\\"What the heck,\\" indeed!  Do I need to tell you who is \\"restored?\\"  I don't think so.  But I *can* tell you the way he goes about it is certainly in keeping with the purple-eyed Mackenzie Calhoun we've all come to know and love.  Instead of *dying* in the explosion of the Excalibur, Calhoun instead miraculously survives his shuttle's nasty crash-landing and *lives* on an arid back-alley planet called Yakaba, taking up with a rainmaker and her young son in his effort to find a way *off* said planet.<br />He accomplishes this in a big way, and in the end finds himself with another boy to call his son.  And there are plenty of hints for the future that this boy, Moke, ain't no one to trifle with any more than is Calhoun himself.<br />Meanwhile, Calhoun's former first officer, Elizabeth Paula Shelby, is busy with problems of her own as captain of the Exeter.  These problems include, but are not limited to, dealing with a first officer with an all-too-familiar attitude about the rules and regs of Starfleet, grieving for Mac and what could have been, and trying to come up with a way to \\"Calhoun\\" a potential Federation member into doing the right thing.  At times, she barely recognizes herself.<br />Add to this a 27-page \\"Star Trek: New Frontier Minipedia\\" in the back, and I'm ready to forgive 'em for publishing in hardback first.  If you're reading them all, you've got to have this one.	2002-01-26

After having read all the Gateways novels (except TOS, which I skimmed), I was *so* ready to read this book, so ready to learn the fates of all my favorite characters and to learn once and for all what happens with the gateways!  Oh...(heavy sigh), well, I *did* learn fates, and I *did* learn what happens with the gateways, but...but...it was all just so, so - not to put too fine a point on it - dull.  The individual novels were *much* more entertaining than these little &quot;conclusions.&quot;<br />I agree with other reviewers who've said these stories might have been better received had they stayed with their original novels, rather than gone into their own book (hardcover, no less).  An ugly little marketing ploy, methinks, and one I shall be on the lookout for in the future.<br />While all the stories contained the predictable amount of adventure, humor and hijinks, and the TNG installment sewed up the Iconian connection, none of them were what I'd call keepers.  We got some good Bajoran history, a goofy Q story, some ice and snow, time jumps and dead people, and an impressive amount of continuity, but for the most part, yawn.<br />Some advice:  *Definitely* read the individual novels first (TOS, too, if you're into it), but don't read them exactly in the order they are numbered.  Save TNG until last, instead of in the Book Three spot it's in.  That's the order the final stories appear in this book (TOS, CH, DS9, VOY, NF, TNG), and it made more sense that way.<br />Also, don't bother buying it unless you absolutely *must* have an entire set, and even then, wait for the paperback at the second-hand book store, which shouldn't be long in coming.  That having been said, another reason you might want to have this particular book in your collection is for the pretty darned incredible &quot;Pocket Books Star Trek Novel Timeline&quot; in the back.  Twenty-six pages worth, including everything from Strange New Worlds stories to audio and ebooks through December 2001.  Mighty impressive, I must say.Mighty impressive, I must say.	2002-01-09

In fact, for the most part, I hate 'em - but Gateways grabbed me, and Robert's TNG installment is simply a fabulous cog on a great big wonderful wheel.<br />I'll admit I was lost at first as to what the heck was going on, but once I understood that different races had already been approached by the, uh, Iconians, about purchasing the gateways tech, I immediately understood the reason why Picard and his mighty ship was summoned to the task of organizing everyone into a united front to meet with the Iconians.<br />What follows is not quite united but certainly surprising, and full of enough references to just about everything TNG Trek that's gone before to cause me to rush to my tapes!  Robert Greenberger is just plain amazing in this capacity, and I'm betting he had it all in his own little head.<br />Add to that Troi's successful stint as captain and loads of Riker/Troi not-so-subtext, and you've got what amounts to - not to put too fine a point on it - a GREAT read.<br />And yup, this one ends with a go-through-the-gateway cliffhanger set to finish in Book Seven of the series, &quot;What Lay Beyond.&quot;  And who else goes through but our great Iconian master, Jean-Luc Picard.

Admittedly, there are holes because I didn't read a few NF installments, but those holes didn't diminish my understanding or enjoyment of this book.  A few details missed?  Yeah.  But in the Big Picture, I was still able to put it all together.  The holes just make me want to go back and read the NF books I missed, so how could that be a bad thing?<br />In this, novel, Peter expertly guides his \\"irreverently-professional\\" bunch through a rousing adventure involving both ancient technology and ancient enemies.<br />Take two vicious enemies and put them on separate planets to keep them away from one another.  Introduce technology (those dratted gateways) that enables them to get to each other in the blink of an eye and boom Big Trouble in Thallonian space.<br />Enter Mac Calhoun on the *Excalibur* and his wife, Elizabeth Shelby, on the *Trident,* charged by Starfleet with keeping the peace.<br />What follows is \\"peacekeeping\\" quite unlike what you might expect from, say, Jean-Luc Picard.  Take, for example, this excerpt, written here to give you an idea of the reigning attitude throughout:<br />\\"Calhoun was standing in the open area within the desk, and Si Cwan was next to him.  The Counselars had made it clear that they would not convene nor speak with him at all unless he stayed in the 'Place of Address,' which was where he was standing at that moment.  Calhoun did not particularly want to be in the Place of Address.  Just then, he'd have far preferred to be in the Place of Beating the Crap out of the Counselars, had such a location actually existed.\\"<br />I ask you, can you beat this?<br />While this novel stands alone just fine, it *ends* with a gateway cliffhanger, same as all the rest of them do, to be taken up in the final novel in this series, \\"What Lay Beyond.\\"<br />But for real?  Read this puppy.  And read all the other Gateway novels while you're at it.at it.	2001-12-17

Would someone just bang me in the eye when I start griping about the Trek &quot;series&quot; books *before* I even crack one cover? I've got to say without doubt the &quot;Gateways&quot; series has been the best so far.<br />While it's not *that* important for you to read them in the order they are numbered, I have found doing so could help to keep sense of the goings-on.  However, since I am *not* reading them in order, I have also found you can still make sense of things, especially if you're familiar with the Big Picture That Is Star Trek.<br />But if you've been needing lessons on how to keep a thousand plot threads in the air at the same time, just ask Keith R.A. DeCandido!  Thanks to the Gateways and a boatload of cleverness, he's all over the galaxy in this novel, and it's a good thing the chapters tell the locations, or otherwise you'd need to make notes.<br />This novel abounds with fine characterizations of the people we love the most (Kira, Nog, Quark, Bashir, Dax, Laren, Yates), a few new ones (Shar, Vaughn, Taran'atar), several we love to hate (Hirogen, Orion, Malon), and a whole host of people on the outside edges that I hope we'll learn more about.<br />Grand adventure awaits, with some mystery and downright confusion thrown in for good measure.  Read the book.<br />One daring aside:  If you're *really* interested in the re-launch of DS9, don't start with this book.  Go back and start with the two &quot;Avatar&quot; books, then read the DS9 installment of the Section 31 series, titled &quot;Abyss,&quot; and THEN read this one.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.	2001-12-06

I must immediately add Doranna Durgin to my short list of favorite Trek authors, and I hope she writes a few more in this universe.  Her writing style is casual and humorous (&quot;Worf Lite,&quot; for example.  Read the book to learn what that's about.), and she sticks very close to canon with her characters, particularly with Worf and Riker.  But...that doesn't mean she's afraid to step out of the box and have Picard do something surprising and refreshingly *un*-diplomatic to get the job done.  I was impressed.<br />I had a very nice time visualizing all three kinds of aliens and the various flora and fauna encountered on the great hunt the Tsorans called the &quot;kaphoora.&quot;  Add to that plot twists involving sabotage on many levels, and to *that* add Geordi's struggle with alien technology and another one of Data's goofy &quot;experiments&quot; in humanity, and you have a swift and entertaining Next Gen tale.	2001-12-02

Let me start by saying it would be just plain impossible for me to give a bad review to Christie Golden.  Sorry, but I just can't do it.  As an added bonus, she used the word &quot;gibe&quot; correctly.  This alone was worth the read.  (An inside joke, to be sure, but it still counts for me.)<br />Unfortunately, I could give this one only three stars because the story itself is pretty watery, though I don't necessarily blame Christie for it.  She wrote a VOY novel set prior to the series end, as part of a crossover series of stories.  I wouldn't wish for a worse set of parameters!  No way can a VOY story with these kinds of limitations ever hope to be anything more than a swift ride with Janeway at the helm.<br />And that's just what this one is.  Strange gateways open in Delta Quadrant space, spilling out all manner of ships, containing friend and foe alike.  Janeway herds and leads.  Things happen.  Up pops a dangerous nebula.  Janeway leads the caravan through.  More things happen.  In the end, we find Janeway herself going through a gateway on a planet and disappearing - thus the set-up for the conclusion, contained, together with conclusions of the other five books in this series, in Book Seven of the Gateways series.  One thin thread keeps this story bound together, but it seems a bit far-&quot;fetched.&quot;	2001-11-20

I went right to this book from Book Six of the &quot;New Earth&quot; series, because I couldn't wait to read more about OTC Nick Keller and the *Challenger.*  This story did not disappoint me, though there were moments I had trouble getting my head around.  The aliens from the other side of the Gateway were introduced rather abruptly, so it was tough reading for a while.  But I stuck with it, and it was well worth it.  This story has substance and purpose, and it reads like a breeze (well, sometimes a breeze through a stable, but a breeze nonetheless).  You can't beat Diane Carey's writing style, and with this one she's pulled off some mighty good ones.<br />Don't know exactly what it is about Keller, Savannah, Zane, Zoa, and Shucorion, but I'm connecting better with this crowd than I did the New Frontier crew.  Sorry, Peter!<br />The only disappointment for me, I guess, was that the ending made me think I should be reading the &quot;Gateways&quot; series in order rather than skipping around.  No matter, I'm still skipping around.  If it looks like I'm missing something by doing that, oh well.  Won't be the first time.<br />Two warnings:  1) Anyone still hunting for familiar Trek characters (or even familiar Belle Terre characters) will not find them in this book.  On the other hand, if you loved Keller &amp; Crew in Book Six of the &quot;New Earth&quot; series and are looking for more adventures from them, this is definitely the one to read.  2) This apparently ain't the last we'll be hearing of *Challenger.*  And to that I say yee-haw!	2001-10-30

Book One, which introduced us to a literal &quot;wagon train to the stars,&quot; was a clear winner, but the books in between had me thinking &quot;Oh, no!  Not AGAIN!&quot;<br />Nevertheless, I fell in love with those poor, beleaguered colonists on Belle Terre, and I'm sincerely glad I made it through to this last novel.  Not only does it help tie up loose ends from the previous novels, it's a rousing story in its own right, introducing us to a whole new band of misfits, not unlike Peter David's &quot;New Frontier&quot; bunch.  Once again, I applaud Diane Carey's writing style, most especially her portrayal of non-regulation-boot wearin' OTC Nick Keller and his cobbled-together ship, the U.F.P.F. *Challenger.*<br />She speaks well, too, of the starship *Enterprise* in one of the finest paragraphs in the whole book:  &quot;Holding her much-reduced family in the petal of her cupped hand, the starship that had protected them for years, extrinsic proof of their high-priced wins, streaked through space pretending there wasn't a strain on her bones at this (warp nine) speed.  *Enterprise* gracefully turned her shoulder to the insult, proving herself once more not just a jumper but a workhorse.&quot;  You just can't get any better than that.<br />But wait, you can!  *Challenger* has bled into yet another series of novels, &quot;Gateways.&quot;  You'll find the reluctant OTC (NOT captain) Keller and his intrepid crew in Book Two, &quot;Chainmail,&quot; written by My Girl, Diane Carey.	2001-10-24

This story is worth every bit of my foam-mouthed praise, and that's *not* just because it has Roxann Dawson's name on it.<br />Okay, to be perfectly honest, I've never been one for attack strategies and bloody battles, or gory details of survival on inhospitable planets, but I *have* been one to read books with strong female leads. This one fits that profile perfectly. In Andrea Flores, you have an unbelievably strong woman, driven by her grief and her anger to discover why her husband and child were brutally killed before her eyes, turning her life inside out.<br />Now a member of the Tenebrea, an elite fighting force formerly made up strictly of the non-human Jod, Andrea finds the support and the strength she needs to find her answers, and she finds good friends and mentors, as well. But some answers only bring more questions, not only for Andrea, but for readers, too.<br />Add to that the gory details and bloody battles mentioned above, sprinkled liberally with a clone resistance movement, betrayal, and dark secrets from the past, and you have a distinctly *fine* bridge to what is bound to be an incredible ending.<br />I was a little disappointed that Dan Curry didn't do the artwork for this cover, but you can't have everything. Besides, Baltimore is mentioned more in this book than in the first, and that tickles so much, it *more* than makes up for the cover art, which is splendid in its own right, anyway, so what am I going on about?	2001-09-30

Let me first mention that I wrote this review before the events of September 11, and now that it is four days later, I wish only to keep it posted here, in the hopes that it may give us a glimpse into a bright, new future - not only for those characters we love in the Trek universe, but for ourselves as well.<br />Some might accuse me of showing favoritism when it comes to my reviews of the Trek novels. Okay...guilty! It's just that because I love Star Trek, I find little fault with those who write in that universe. Plus, I only read the novels that interest me, so of course my reviews might be more favorable than if I were reading them *all.* But I digress. On to &quot;Endgame.&quot;<br />Janeway had a mission, and that was to get her crew home. She did. End of story. Anyone who thinks there should have been more to that story *must* read this novelization. The blanks are nicely filled in with all the things the televised episodes do not have enough time for.  Add to that Diane Carey's unique maritime writing style (the &quot;icebreaker prow&quot; of one of the cube's corners, for example), her delicious narrative (&quot;Seven had never been at ease with the way men looked at her.  Having no barometer of social tenderizing with which to judge things as fleeting as physical presence, she didn't know she was an eagle's cry from average.&quot;) and her use of the number 47, and, well, you've got yum with a spoon!<br />Certainly, the whole TV episode is in there, but the additional information provided by thoughts and narrative make for a much deeper, more understandable, story. About the only fault I found was the number of typos (7). But that's no big deal when it comes to the story as a whole.<br />As to Christie Golden's four chapters of &quot;Homecoming&quot; at the end, I'm not ashamed to say I cried a little, and I cannot wait to read the whole thing. Resolution abounds for many characters and hints at more to come. It's obvious resolution's not the *only* thing going on in &quot;Homecoming,&quot; but for a teaser, well, let's just say I'm saving my pennies to buy the book.g going on in &quot;Homecoming,&quot; but for a teaser, well, let's just say I'm saving my pennies to buy the book.	2001-09-07

I don't know about you, but I'm having a big ol' ball going back and reading some of these earlier Trek novels (See &quot;The Murdered Sun&quot;).<br />Greg Cox and John Gregory Betancourt penned a wonderful, two-plot early adventure that ties in canon information about the Hortas with newer information about the Cardassians.  This novel just sizzled with all that lovely hatred the Bajorans had for their (former) oppressors.<br />This one's also chock full of early Bashir attitude, before we learned about his enhanced genetics and certainly *well* before he got over himself about being a ladies man.  Quite entertaining, I say, and darned amusing, too.  In fact, this story abounds with perfect early characterizations of all of them - Kira, Dax, Odo, Quark, the O'Briens, Sisko, Nog, Jake, and Rom, and was a pure delight to read, this long after the series ended.<br />But don't worry about the Cardies or the Hortas - Our Man Bashir comes through in the end.  Wait a minute, what am I saying?  *Everybody* comes through in the end - of COURSE they do, this is Star Trek!  And there's nothing wrong with that.<br />A-plot concentrates on a daring Kira/Bashir/Dax rescue of a mama Horta from the Cardies, and when you stir in the almost-goofy b-plot about 20 accidentally-hatched baby Hortas on DS9 (mmm...who managed that, don't ya wonder?), you've got a what amounts to a mighty grand escapade in the finest of Star Trek tradition.	2001-08-10

Copyright 1996, it shows beautifully the Voyager crew as they were at that time.  Certainly, we've learned new things about the characters as the seasons progressed, and later novels reflect this, but these first efforts should not be dismissed just because they may not fit what we now know.<br />Besides, this one was chock full of references to Chakotay's Native American heritage, which was, in fact, integral to the plot - something sorely lacking in the show after about the second season.  For this reason (and also because it's still a Kes-inclusive story), it's worth the read.<br />Okay, so the plot was a teensy bit predictable (two alien races at war, with a big secret between them), but why is that bad?  This is a Star Trek tale, ferheavensake, it doesn't have to be the world's greatest novel.  It just has to be a lively and entertaining ensemble story that makes me feel good at the end.

I've read the other reviews, and if you'd rather not bother with this one, just go read Nathan Burgoine's.<br />For me, this story was not unreadable by itself, but I realized pretty fast that I should have read the &quot;Avatar&quot; books first, if for no other reason than to fill in the blanks. There were just way too many interesting new characters obviously introduced in &quot;Avatar,&quot; that I knew nothing about. But Ro is back where she belongs, and I'm happy for that, even if I still don't have all the details.<br />It was a different story altogether from the Voyager Section 31 novel, &quot;Shadow,&quot; and to compare that one with this would be unfair. Having said that, I'd now like to give &quot;Shadow&quot; even *more* credit, written as it was without benefit of a lovely DS9 relaunch story arc.<br />But I digress. This story was very compelling. In fact, it had it all: adventure, horror, romance, a decent villian with a Khan complex, a b-plot on DS9 (carried over from &quot;Avatar&quot;), aliens ya wanna save, and our &quot;I Spy&quot; hero, Julian Bashir. I particularly liked one nasty S31 bit near the front, wherein Julian was &quot;asked&quot; by Cole to help the cause once again. Very insidious.<br />But even though this story had resolution, I could still see a number of threads left unraveled on purpose. Not sure if I'm pleased or ... about this, as it will clearly mean I'll need to keep buying the books if I want to keep up, and it's already getting to be a bit much for me. (I mean, &quot;Gateways&quot; is a seven-book series. C'mon! I couldn't get through &quot;New Earth,&quot; and that was only six, nevermind &quot;Double Helix&quot; or &quot;New Frontier.&quot;) Then again, that IS what it's all about, now innit? Heavy sigh...<br />Update (12-4-01):  The above having been said, I must now add:  If you really want a high-class, well-told adventure, read the two &quot;Avatar&quot; books first, then go from this one straight to Book Four of &quot;Gateways,&quot; the DS9 installment titled &quot;Demons of Air and Darkness.&quot;  And here I was, grousing...

When I first learned that one of my favorite Star Trek actresses was co-writing the first of a trilogy, I couldn't wait to own it. Didn't matter her writing style or the book's content.  Now that I've got my own autographed hardback copy, my feelings about it have not changed, except to say I *like* her writing style and the book's content.  She and Daniel Graham make a spectacular team.<br />The cover art, by Dan Curry, features the heroine, Andrea Flores, and is dark and quite suitable to the story.  It also happens to be a little-disguised picture of Roxann herself, capturing perfectly the entire feel of the story, which counts for a lot to me.  Yes, I *do* buy books for their covers!<br />I don't know if it was intentional or not, but the similarities between &quot;B'Elanna Torres&quot; and &quot;Andrea Flores&quot; were too numerous to mention (including this rhyming-name thing, which I just now realized).<br />Others might snort at this point and call me a rabid fan and, well, they'd be right.  But that doesn't diminish the page-turning intensity of this novel.<br />The story opens on Baltimore's Inner Harbor - right where I work.  While it turns into the site of the grisly murders of Andrea's husband and child right before her eyes, it is also the beginning of a very fine tale, one that not only follows Andrea on her rage-filled quest to find out *why,* but also drops clues and promises of much more to come in the next two novels.<br />Consider planetary Alliances, human cloning operations, and something called a &quot;wilderness cloak,&quot; and you've got yourself the beginnings of a sweeping story that I can't hardly wait to finish.	2001-07-06

I've been reading some of the other reviews, and I gotta tell ya, I'm wondering just what it *is* people expect from Star Trek!

This story is by no means the be-all and end-all of Trek tales, but it IS a decent read - nevermind that bitchin' picture of Seven-of-Nine on the cover!  (Okay, so I buy for the covers as well as the story - this is wrong?) I will admit I have the distinct impression the Section 31 thing is just a trumped-up Paramount ploy to sell books and merchandise, but I'm not going to fault them for that, since it's probably true.  The &quot;aliens in trouble&quot; plot was pretty basic (but the aliens themselves were *purple,* an added bonus that B'Elanna got a unique kick out of) and so was the whole Section 31 plot to kill Seven, but still, I didn't find it an unacceptable story.  And the biggest bonus of all, Dean and Kristine name those rotten alien experimenters from &quot;Scientic Method.&quot;  After all they did to the crew, it's about TIME they got a name.

We get to feel some of Worf's grief over the death of Jadzia.  We even get to taste the heartache he still carries for K'Ehleyr - even as he now tackles his first job as Klingon Ambassador to the Federation.  Why, this little story is just *packed* with tidbits of continuity and resolution, at the same time delivering a sturdy, believable tale about a race of beings who simply want their planet back.

This is not necessarily Susan Wright's fault.  She is limited, like all the pro-novelists are, by canon. Some things just *cannot happen,* even in the Mirror Universe.<br />But still, the thing that disappointed me the most (and I guess this *is* Susan Wright's fault), the novel ultimately turned out NOT to be about &quot;the strong women of the Mirror Universe,&quot; but was instead a thinly veiled story about Our Girl Not A Borg In This Universe But Still A Mighty Well-Stacked Terran Raised By Cardassians Member Of The Obsidian Order Seven-of-Nine.

I've read the eight reviews here already, and there's just isn't much more I can add.  I gave this book a 4-star rating instead of a 5, simply because I wanted more right away!  Thankfully, I'm getting it as I read book #10 (&quot;Renaissance&quot;), but I fear I'll be left hanging until &quot;Restoration&quot; comes out in paperback.  This is not necessarily a complaint.<br />I love everything about the New Frontier universe.  The characters (and their complex develoment), the lack of worry about TV canon, and the fiendishly delightful plots.<br />Peter's got me on this series, but good.	2000-10-06

It's very interesting, this Captain's Table series, in that each book begins in the bar, but then basically goes the way of the author who wrote it.<br />I was at first annoyed with all the interruptions (both from  'beings' in the bar listening to Sisko tell the story and by Sisko's own  thoughts), because that's not how the other books are written.  Once I got  over myself about it and just let myself fall into the story, I was fine.  In fact, I found that one alien darned amusing.<br />There were a couple of  editing rough spots, but I dismissed those because it's just silly to  bother. This is a paperback novel, not brain surgery.<br />The Mist are an odd  bunch, and you'll just never guess where they live.<br />Once again I can  say, the Captain's Table bar is the perfect backdrop for fine Trek  storytelling.	2000-04-17

Printed in two-column style, little this book is packed full of goofy but fun references to Destructo Beams and Imagizers, Giant Trundle Spiders and Beings Not From This Universe. And, of course, Constance Goodheart's very good screams.<br />I was disappointed in the photographs, taken as they were  from Voyager's only Proton episodes, &quot;Night,&quot; and &quot;Bride of  Chaotica!&quot; and used over and over (all at least twice and several more  times than that).<br />But if you're looking for a harmless bit of sci-fi  fluff and don't mind the $$ for it this one's for you.  Me?  I got mine with a gift certificate!	2000-01-05

The man neatly finishes stories begun in &quot;The Quiet Place (NF #7), and then sends us into a tidy &quot;talespin.&quot;<br />In this story, we learn all about Si Cwan's sister and Calhoun's son.  We're also introduced  to a couple of right nasty pieces of work; one called a High Priest and the  other the Black Mass.  Set mostly aboard the starship Excalibur, we are  also treated to much more of the antics of the intrepid crew than we were  in #7, including - but not limited to - love and laughter, joy and hate,  and a certain time-honored function of nature.<br />Let's just hope #9 is  being printed even as I write this.	1999-12-28

I've been reading the adventures of the Excalibur crew from day one, and this story is certainly a fine addition to my collection.  While we do not get  to hear much from Mackenzie Calhoun himself, we DO get to fight the good  fight with a woman who just might be Si Cwan's sister.  Even *better,* we  get to see the battle from the Bad Guys' point of view, something I find  very entertaining. I only regret the Dogs of War were not pictured on the  cover.  Though my imagination does them fine justice, it would have been  cool to see an artist's rendition of what Peter had in *his* imagination!  And if you think this is the end of it, ha.  Not hardly.  I'm glad I bought  #8 already, because I'm cracking it open this afternoon.	1999-12-21

She spins a great tale, a sidebar to the Double Helix plotline - but, wait a minute, no, it's not a sidebar at all.<br />Much character development in the form of a young ensign who starts  out determined to do everything by the book and then ends up learning that  &quot;by the book&quot; might not get you very far.<br />Great interaction  between our old favorites, Spock and McCoy, and some mighty fine Crusher  moments, as well.  (Her scene with Data and the Romulan guards is  priceless.)<br />Meantime, the plot thickens, the virus twists again, we've  already learned there's a &quot;bad guy,&quot; and we're all hating like  heck that he keeps getting away!	1999-08-30

I *really* enjoyed getting not only some backstory on Kathryn Pulaski, but also some knowledge of what she did *after* she left the Enterprise.  It's nice to have some blanks filled in so expertly!<br />This story increases the  complexity not only of the plotline, but of the virus itself.  Great  character interaction between Dukat and Pulaski.  Good insight into life on  Terok Nor before the Feds stepped in.<br />Another step further along the  twisted double helix of this story.  Let's hope the next one is just as  intriguing.	1999-08-30

Peter David gets to do what we all love to do:  color outside the lines,  AND get full approval from The Powers That Be to do so.  While Mr. David  can be a big pompous windbag in person, he sure knows how to pen a  wonderfully satisfying story.<br />When I read a Star Trek novel, I wanna be  entertained, and Peter David's stories entertain me &quot;Rakash.&quot;  Oh, sorry.  To discover what &quot;Rakash&quot; means, you gotta read the  book.<br />Anyway, because of David's outstanding ability to write the  words, I'll forgive him his &quot;windbag-ness&quot; every single  time.<br />For those of you following the New Frontier adventures of Captain  Mackenzie Calhoun and the intrepid but rather whacko crew of the Excalibur,  you will certainly remember the many references to the incident aboard the  U.S.S. Grissom.<br />Well, this here little paperback describes that incident  in full detail.  And believe me, it ain't for the faint of heart.<br />Once  again, the Captain's Table bar sets the stage for Star Trek storytelling,  and Peter David is one of Trek's finest tellers.  Action, adventure,  heartache, revenge, death, destruction, humor, sex, and scandal - this book  has it all and then some.	1998-10-06

I don't know enough of the right words to describe this book.  It is a  visual masterpiece, accompanied by glimpses into the twisted mind of Harlan  Ellison via his interpretation of each picture.  Jacek Yerka and Harlan  Ellison:  a perfect match, if you ask me.<br />If you have trouble getting  through some of Ellison's longer works, try this book.  And even if you  HATE Harlan Ellison, try this book.  Nowhere have I seen such hauntingly  wonderful illustrations.  They stick with you.  And sometimes, sometimes,  Ellison's story sticks, too.	1998-09-22

As much as Jeri Taylor strayed from canon in  &quot;Pathways,&quot; Golden sticks like glue to it in this book.  Canon  references abound throughout, and there's even one delightful reference to  Seven's role in the WW II simulation during the Hirogen takeover  (&quot;Seven's holodeck stint as a cabaret singer when the ship was under  the command of the Hirogen was something of a legend on Voyager.  The role  had been so out of character for her, it had made more of an impression on  the crew than Tuvok's bartender or Chakotay's American soldier.&quot;)  If  you enjoy this sort of thing - which I do - then buy the book!<br />Canon  aside, the story is a completely original Seven tale, with a compelling  plot that weaves hatred and a desire for revenge around a twist that  includes Seven and *real* memories from her time as a Borg drone.  These  memories assault her so viciously that she attempts suicide to stop them.  Ravens also appear, but to learn whether they are good or evil, you gotta  read the book!	1998-09-22
US	52706312	R21ZI3KXC8Y8RI	0671003461	955843525	Pathways (Star Trek Voyager)	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Disappointing, darn it.	Someone once told me Star Trek on television is &quot;fact,&quot; the  novels are &quot;fiction,&quot; and the fanfic is &quot;fantasy.&quot;  That's worked for me - up until Jeri Taylor's novels.  Being a former  executive producer of the show, I was under the impression that Jeri's  novels became &quot;fact,&quot; and &quot;Mosaic&quot; did.  This one  canNOT.<br />The set-up, while perfect for storytelling, is woefully unlike  anything Janeway would do.  That is, she leaves her ENTIRE senior staff on  a planet and takes Voyager to negotiations with an alien race.  Of course,  the crew is promptly gassed to unconsciousness and carted off to a squalid,  outdoor prison full of thousands of other poor schmucks.  It is there, in  between their making plans to escape, that they tell each other their  histories.  The ending is typically Trek - too much, too fast.<br />Don't get  me wrong, it's a *great* read.  You just can't consider much of it canon.  Jeri does not seem to take into consideration many details we already know  to be true.  I would think, if you're gonna write about a Trek character's  history, you would be sure to include canon.  But no. Inconsistencies  abound.  This is fiction.  Fiction, fiction, fiction.<br />I guess the only  reason I can think of for why she strayed so far from canon was because she  included healthy, well-adjusted homosexuals in her story - and everyone  knows there are none like that in Starfleet...	1998-09-17

I'm a big Gary Larson fan, but I thought this book was a bit much, even  for him.  I understand the point he was trying to make (that is, 'tug at  one thing in nature and you'll find it is connected to everything else'),  but he was waaay too severe with driving it home, particularly that ending.  This is not a bedtime story!<br />On the other hand, if his goal was to set  readers thinking about what we are doing to the environment, even with the  best intentions, and how it may come back to haunt us, then  touche'!<br />Nevertheless, it gave me the willies, and I'm no hothouse  flower.	1998-09-16

I own all three in this series (Voyager), and as I understand it, there  won't be anymore due to low sales.  Darn that bottom line!  These are  wonderful early Janeway stories; quick reads for adults, although a young  person might need a little more time.  The thing that drew me most to these  books was the artwork.  Can't quite remember the artist's name (wanna say  Somebody Palmer? Jason?) They are black-and-white sketches that go  perfectly with the storyline.

Jeri Taylor is my absolute favorite, and I know her  writing style will be missed on the new season of Voyager.  I hope she  continues to pen the novels, because her stories are magnificent.  We are  given a clear view of Janeway in this book.  The story may make a few  leaps, but the path is still direct from child to captain - to television,  in fact, because some of the &quot;facts&quot; in the book have been  related on screen.  I shall re-read often.	1998-09-04

She does what every good writer should do, she  &quot;writes what she knows.&quot;  She's a sailor, and it shines through  every novel.  Living in Baltimore as I do, where everything's nautical, I  enjoy her stories very, very much.  I know I'll never become a sailor  myself, but it sure is fun reading about sailing in her books!  Who said  you can't learn anything from fiction?  HA!<br />The &quot;Captain's  Table&quot; bar is a good backdrop for this swell Janeway romp through  space unknown, in a ship unknown, with Janeway serving as little more than  deckhand (Ms. Carey told me the exact job title, but I forget what she  said!).  Written from Janeway's point of view, this book allows the reader  to fall right into her head - and heart.  Delicious.  Fun.  Good Stuff.	1998-09-04

Having little bad to say about anything Star Trek, my review will be biased, but if you watch the television episode and then read this book, you will realize what readers have always known: Books are much better than TV! While the entire script (pretty much) is in this novel, Michael Jan Friedman's and Jeri Taylor's story goes into so much more depth about the aliens and their motivations that you find yourself at least *understanding* why they acted as they did.  A sub-subplot reveals another slice of the Holodoc, and his on-going quest to augment his programming, which is totally absent from the TV episode.  Of course, the Tom &amp; B'Elanna plotline will certainly keep the attention of all the Paris/Torres fans, but that's not all there is to this story.	1998-07-21
