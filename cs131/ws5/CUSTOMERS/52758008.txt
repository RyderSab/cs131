Unfortunately, it shows.  The first part of the book has a snappiness and freshness that is missing from the rest of the book.  I wasn't swept away by this book as I have been by other &quot;writing books&quot; -- say by Natalie Goldberg.  But then not all writing books should or can do that.<br />The main part of this book is packed with practical,  how-to information for novice and established writers alike.  All of it is useful.  None of it is unimportant.  The best part?  King's claim that you can make a competent writer into a good writer, but you can't make a bad writer into a compentent one.  You have to come with a certain amount of stuff already intact.  I'm glad someone has finally put that out there on the table for the truth that it is.  King also includes a line-by-line edit of one of his own stories so you can compare and contrast.<br />I was also impressed by King's great intelligence.  Of course, you can't write even bad run-away bestsellers if you don't have some brains and talent, but it really came through in this book.  And one cannot dismiss his courage in going back to his desk after his tragic accident.  There is a lot to be learned from this &quot;short&quot; book (King's words).	2000-10-25

And just  how many times does a single character get to &quot;goggle&quot; in one  book?.  And what is with the weird old guy in the toolshed?  Like anybody  in their right mind even in the '60s would have let their prepubescent girl  hang out with a pudgy, white guy in some strange gardening shed in the back  of some weird overgrown garden.  I've enjoyed this author's other books and  so was much disappointed by this pale pretender.  None of the characters  are likeable or intriguing, nothing insightful is revealed about anything  (especially about racism or family secrets -- which I gather is what this  book is supposed to be about) and the ending was just too stupid to  actually have been written.  If this was supposed to be an hommage to or an  update of To Kill a Mockingbird, it isn't even in the same ballpark. I'm  hoping for much better from Siddons the next time around.	2000-09-12

Be forewarned -- this isn't strictly about the pediatric E.R.  There's a lot  in here about medical school and other experiences significant to the  author.  The book is more a long philosophical rumination about and  reflection on the importance of doctors.  <br />There is a certain tone to it  that I couldn't quite pin down but that I found off-putting.  Maybe it is  the distance of an extremely disciplined, intelligent, and dedicated human  being trying to relate to all the rest of us poor slobs.  He even admits  that is why he chose pediatrics because he couldn't stand dealing with  adults (I didn't hold this against him--it's why I used to teach  preschool--but it stung to see it in print from a man who is supposed to  care about people). I was impressed by the hard work that goes into being a  doctor.  I knew about this but it was important to hear it again.  You may  have read about it or seen it before in medical movies and books, but the  personal take on it here gives it a newness that impressed me.  If you're  looking for brief and many stories about chaotic and dramatic medical  tragedies like in the t.v. show ER, you won't find it here.  But if you are  interested in reading one man's insight into his demanding and difficult  career, this will make a very absorbing read.	2000-09-12

Complaints:  the weirdness and dysfunction far outweighed the  &quot;crime&quot; as *finally* revealed at the end; there is a familiarity  in this book in tone, setting, and dysfunction to other books I've read  lately -- the turn-of-the century, crazy sister who is made crazy because  everyone ignores her because she is weird, ugly, plain, or too smart genre  -- give it a rest; long stretches of this book are very clunky and suffer  too much from first-novelitis; it just takes too long both in literal  reading time and novel-time for the final &quot;truths&quot; to be made  apparent to everyone; the unrelenting grimness of this book is a success on  one level (in the ability to maintain tone) but doesn't make for an  uplifting, insightful or entertaining read.  I was most disappointed in  this book.  Parts of it are superb, but not nearly enough to carry its  weight.	2000-09-12

As a new-comer (at an old age) to this field, I was intimidated  by much of what I was reading when it comes to learning about the heavens  and the tools to do so.  This book makes it all accessible and includes  some very straightforward and understandable starcharts.  I'm not sure how  the information about telescopes will stay up-to-date but it was perfect  for me.

US	52758008	R3UJH661PYUK1R	0385319347	882427602	Lost in Translation	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Entertaining	Although highly readable and entertaining, this novel reveals nothing new about China and engages in a number of old stereotypes about the  inscrutable Chinese.  While the abstract lead me to believe this would be  an exotic, slightly erotic tour through modern China and it starts out that  way, it quickly devolves into a typical romance set in an exotic locale.   In addition, the plot often feels too contrived in order to include all  that &quot;Chinesey&quot; stuff:  the Cultural Revolution, the threat of  arrest, the spying, the paranoia, the old temples and homes.  The author  would have done better to streamline her plot and focus only on those  aspects of China that were essential.  The writing seems clunky at times  and many of the characters are too cardboard and &quot;B&quot; movie  stereotypes.  The heroine, however, is clearly delineated and strongly  different from most contemporary heroines.  So, points for that.<br />In tone  and purpose, this novel reminded me too much of &quot;The Sheltering  Sky&quot;: disaffected young woman penetrates the remotest regions of an  alien culture only to discover her true essence.  While this is a nice  addition to the genre of books set in China,  there is nothing terribly  exciting or new here.	2000-08-23

It very thorougly and completely details what went on in  Houston from the moment of the &quot;accident&quot; to the recovery of the  astronauts.  This book helped me to understand how critical Mission Control  is to space flights, how the astronauts are not necessarily piloting their  spacecraft but that it is a joint effort.  I was surpised by many facts  given here such as that Mission Control had more information about the  status of the spacecraft than the astronauts themselves.  The author does  an outstanding job of expalining the technicalities of what happened and  why without making you feel like a dummy.<br />Through the lens of 25 years,  it is very interesting to read this account and feel some of the respect  and almost naivete the author and the public felt for NASA and the  government at large that has long since been lost.  I also enjoyed how the  book was divided into three sections &quot;Out&quot;  &quot;Around&quot;   &quot;Home&quot;.<br />I did feel the book suffered from its narrow focus on  Mission Control only during the duration of the &quot;event,&quot; and no  pictures -- none and only one line diagram.  These are small complaints,  however.  The book makes a wonderful companion to Jim Lovell's account.	2000-08-22
US	52758008	RBY9M65XCLJ27	0399145990	217600181	The River King	Books	2	10	15	N	N	Old hat	I've read all of Alice Hoffman's books and maybe that's the problem here.  So much of this book I've already read about in her previous novels -- the  dangerously attractive cop, the incredible flowers, the insects and storms  out-of-season.  Unfortunately, this is old territory and I found I had  trouble getting through this book because I kept getting *bored*!  <br />In  addition, the overall mood and the plot itself are both rather dark and  unrelentingly depressing.  Hoffman's previous books (especially the earlier  ones) may have had dark elements but the overall tone was one of lightness  and magicalness.  This one was just cold and depressing.  The central  &quot;crime&quot; is extraordinarily vicious and the resolution not at all  believable.  The writing itself is staid and tedious.  I couldn't believe I  actually read &quot;Carlin exploded into giggles&quot; in a Hoffman book.  Finally, Hoffman writes to her own stereotypes of love and men and women in  love.  I've read about them all before too many times.  I also had the  lurking suspicion while I was reading that I was acutally reading a movie  idea rather than a novel.<br />After so many books in the same genre it may  well be time for Hoffman to take a break and try something entirely new  (maybe she should read Natalie Goldberg's new book).	2000-08-13
US	52758008	R217ONE8HRUPMD	0375504052	824786819	Blameless: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Unusual and interesting	The protaganist of this novel is not your typical contempory women's lit heroine.  And that is wonderfully intriguing and entertaining.  She drinks  beer, loves her car, paints her own house, prefers her own company, and  likes rough sex.  But she's also very, very depressed.  With good reasons,  as we come to find out.<br />The book is a rather dark read but compelling.   It deals with an issue too much with us these days.  And ultimately asks us  to consider the damage of family secrets and lies.  Not just to the family  members but the community at large.<br />I ran across this book by sheer  chance and I'm glad I did.  I found the cover design entirely misleading,  however.  It is much to feminized and wishy washy.  Something this novel  definitely is not.	2000-08-10

I also found I had to read  this a little bit at a time to give myself time to absorb what she was  trying to say.  But I was really shaken up by the book.  After writing a  terrible, terrible truly horrible and horribly boring novel myself, I had  given up writing (after 35 years).  In other words, I was in a similar  place as Natalie was in the closing chapter of this book.  How she dealt  with that and what she relates about that are extraordinary and absolutely  inspirational.  It got me to pick up a pen again.<br />Natalie has always had  a Zen slant to her writing and it is even more evident here.  The  connection between the disciplines of writing practice and meditation  really struck home with me.  Especially as it addresses the ultimate point  of writing.  While this book does deal with issues of structure (and I  disagree strongly that this book is just for prose writers), it addresses  more the spiritual and personal nature of writing.  Why write? it dares us  to ask. Why write at all?  As usual, Natalie is challenging our basic  beliefs of ourselves and particulary ourselves as writers.  Why do *you*  write?  This book will inspire you to seek the answer to that fearsome  question for yourself.  <br />I am indebted to Natalie for constantly opening  herself up to an unknown and naturally critical audience.  She does sound  older and wiser here and that gives me pause too.  It goes back to the  fundemental question -- why write?  This is not a writing instruction book  per se, you can visit her previous books for help in that area.  This book  is something beyond that.  Something almost intangible.  I was deeply moved  by the book and tremendously inspired.  Thank you Natalie for giving so  fully yet once again.	2000-08-10

Where did he come up with  &quot;Princes of Maine, Kings of New England.&quot;  How did he come up  with these full and rich and wonderful characters?<br />I, too, read the book  after seeing the movie.  Therefore, the last 1/2 of this book was a  complete surprise to me.  The movie is wonderful in its own way but  although I enjoyed it, I didn't quite &quot;get it.&quot;  After reading  the book, I understand why.  This isn't so much a story about race (which  seemed to be a powerful point of the movie) as a story about abortion  (which was rather NOT a big point of the movie).  I agree, however, that  this book isn't really &quot;about&quot; abortion.  I guess its more about  discovering your place in the world -- despite or because of your flaws,  and everybody seems to have them.   It took a while to fully sink into this  book and at times I had to put it down because it was SO rich with detail I  would get a little full.  But I was truly blown away with it and  immediately started to reread it.  This is the kind of book that you just  hold in your hand with awe and look at and say, &quot;How does he DO  that?!&quot;  I'm glad the movie came out so that the novel will get a  second chance to be read by a new audience...like me.	2000-08-09

About five years ago, I started up again and my  &quot;habit&quot; has gotten more out of control and I have never been  heavier.  <br />I didn't really need Potatoes to let me know I am a sugar  addict, I already knew that.  But it was somehow reassuring to work through  the self-questionnaire.  I could see myself over and over again.  The plan  itself is fairly straightforward and really worked to help me finally get  back off the sugar (I had been trying for years without much luck).  <br />The  slightly hectoring tone and the use of lots of graphs and medical  terminology is very 90s to me and I thought the style of writing rather  simplistic but maybe thats because I didn't need to be convinced.  Although  I've done food journals up the yin yang, I didn't balk too much at her  suggested way of doing it and found out some interesting things.  I'm not  convinced you need to do it forever every day but for awhile and when you  feel shaky -- could be very helpful. Her other steps of upping protein and  eating ONLY three meals a day (I have NEVER, EVER done that!) make complete  sense and have been suprisingly effective.<br />I'm not sure its necessary to  be so extreme, but then that could just be me.  This is an important aspect  of the author's plan:  try it her way then experiment -- its a PROCESS.  If  you think you're addicted to sugar (and BELIEVE me, her suggested clues are  right on the money there) this may be the book to help you break that  vicious cycle.	2000-08-09

But I've long been interested in astronomy and particularly the Apollo program.  After seeing Apollo 13 (the movie) about 4 times, I  decided to look into some books for a more accurate account of that  particular mission.  I got this one because Jim Lovell helped write it.   After I got it, I found out the movie was based on this book and it was  interesting and amusing to note the differences between the two.<br />Despite  my &quot;handicap,&quot; I found this book to be highly readable and much  more gripping than the movie.  I polished it off in about three days.  On  the other hand, I'm not sure how much I would have understood if I hadn't  seen the movie and known (from history) the basic plot.  There was also  some biographical information about Jim Lovell that I found extraneous to  this particular account and some stuff left out that I would have found  interesting (like training for the actual moon walk which wasn't even  really touched on).  An appendix at the end with suggested further reading  would also have been a nice touch.<br />But the two authors do a remarkable  job of taking what was basically a technological catastrophe and putting a  very real and very human face on it.  This is a book I am sure I will read  again.	2000-07-20

Of course right away she  meets a tall man with incredibly kind eyes.  Not much new here.<br />From time  to time I found the writing to be superb, almost poetic.  Other times I  found myself skipping pages that were filled with exquisite details of  conversations and occurances that were there only to lead up to something  and were unimportant in themselves (do we really have to know all about  Attorney Luc's children?).<br />Finally, I was desperately irritated with the  cover of this book.  I know, I know, never judge a book...But I did.  I got  this book primarily because of the cover.  I thought it would be  lighthearted and maybe full of magical realism because of the wavy text and  the musical score and the inviting park scene.  Well, forget it!  This is  supposed to be a rather dark and twisted tale though it never amounts to  much more than a &quot;scary&quot; episode on a daily soap opera (remember  Dark Shadows?)

In that sense I wasn't disappointed in this slim novel that actually reads as  a collection of short stories revolving around the central  characters.<br />But much of this is ground that Hoffman has covered  elsewhere. I've already read about the amazing flowers in Practical Magic.   I've read about the dangerously seductive boyfriends.  And I had trouble  with the age of the main character.  It seemed awfully fluid from chapter  to chapter.  <br />Despite all that, this is still a good Hoffman read. It  might not have moved me as much as her previous books nor necessarily  covered new territory but it was entertaining and highly readable all the  same.	2000-06-20

She almost deserved all  the bad stuff that comes hurtling at her she's so self absorbed. The author  spends an awful lot of time detailing arguements between the mother and her  teenage daughter to the point that you wanted to slap both of them and slam  the book shut.  <br />Mostly my biggest quibble is with the circumstances in  the last third of the book that were so unlikely as to be almost silly.  At  one point, a hired investigator responds to the main character's theories  with &quot;I don't buy it.&quot;  Well, me, too.  I didn't buy it.  Didn't  buy the situation, didn't buy the characters' responses to the situation.   <br />I read this whole book in a matter of hours because I skimmed large  chunks of it (NOT a good sign).  I admit I was drawn into the story and  that kept me going but the overall experience was one of irritation.   Including the title.  A reference to one throw-away phrase somewhere in the  middle that really didn't have a lot to do with what was really going  on.<br />I'm not sure what the point to this book was supposed to be:   maternal devotion against all odds?  coming to terms with the real  priorities in life?  the inexplicability of life itself?  the weirdness  inherent in most American families?  was this just a suspense novel of some  kind?  You know what occurs to me, this is a Hollywood screenplay in novel  form.  If you read it that way, a text version of a summer blockbuster, you  won't expect more than it can deliver.	2000-06-20

I found it fresh and clean and the format of the novel with it's poem-like chapters was simply great. A very contemporary novel (including its smaller physical  size).  Hence the three stars.<br />Unfortunately (and a big unfortunately) I  also felt royally manipulated by this story.  Why is it that women  (especially mothers) have to pay such a high price for their rather minor  indescretions?  I am SO tired of that morality. It's as if a new mother lay  in bed in a rather bad post-partum depression and fantasized about the  worst thing that could happen to her family because of her behavior and  then wrote a book about it.  Extremely self-indulgent.  The characters  don't grow or change because of their actions and consequences, they just  react. I was depressed and irritated by this story.  I don't mind a dark  story but I do mind a depressing one.  If this is marriage in the 90s, no  thanks!	2000-06-15

I almost put it down at first because I thought it was going to be another story about a young girl &quot;in trouble&quot; back when there were even fewer options than  there are today.  But I decided to give it a few more pages and am glad I  did.<br />This novel goes well beyond that overdone and familiar plotline to  be something altogether different.  The book is filled with a rich  assortment of characters that are vividly drawn and while being familiar  are also unique.  The technique of writing from different viewpoints  actually works here as each character's voice is clearly unique and of a  different age chronologically.  Jamie's (the brother's) voice while brief  is exquistely done -- perfectly capturing the rush and excitement of young  boys on the cusp of manhood.<br />The book is so well written that when the  sad parts occur they don't feel manipulative.  The ending is so wrenching  but so true and perfect for the characters, the story, and the future of  the story.<br />My only quibbles are that I did almost put the book aside  because of where I thought it was headed, I did some skimming during  dialogue used to move the plotline along, and I must have missed something  in that skimming or the opening chapters where I wasn't quite hooked  because I didn't ever get the book's title.<br />But those are small  complaints.  This book while a dark tale wasn't depressing (how did she DO  that?).  Instead, it was like diving into a rich and sumptious feast.  What  a treat after reading so many shallow cookie-cutter bestsellers.  I look  forward to reading more from this author.	2000-06-12

It doesn't take a whole lot of concentration and the plot is interesting enough to keep your attention.<br />While the title implies some  pretty gritty stuff, it turns out this is more of a suspenseful romance  novel than a grim murder mystery.  Although the heroine is being hunted by  while hunting for a serial killer, there aren't tremendously gruesome and  gratuituous descriptions of the killings which is a relief.<br />The plot is  moved along primarily through the use of dialogue which makes for fast and  easy reading.  And while there aren't a whole lot of surprises in here (I  mean does Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis ever actually die in their movies?),  the ending was a nice little twist and Johansen does a good job of defining  characters deftly with minimum words. <br />Not a deep book by any means, but  a decent and quick read.	2000-06-10

I was completely captivated by the author's loving descriptions of childhood.  The heroine was so wonderfully created I could see her, at times even smell her.  The  author does a tremendous job of creating a place and a time and a family  shaded ever so carefully by memory -- the perfect blend of nostalgia and  sentiment.  If you are a boomer, you'll be able to identify with much of  this book, especially that special feel of a 1950s household with the  stay-at-home mom, the at-work dad and the unvarying but oh-so-comforting  routine.<br />After all that, however, I was disappointed in the conclusion of  this book.  The reason for the heroine's estrangement from her mother seems  rather minor when it is revealed and the ending seems a letdown, very  movie-of-the-weekish.  <br />But that is actually a very, very small part of  the book.  Don't let it keep you from reading it.  It's perfect for your  airplane trip or to stash in your beach bag.  And it just might get you to  call your sister!	2000-06-06

It starts with an interesting premise but then it doesn't really go anywhere with it except into long and detailed descriptions of, well, gross stuff.   And the bad guys, the super bad guys of all time, are the Chinese (big  surprise there given our current economical/political situation with  China).  But their goal seems so small and  uncreative. The plot starts out  with high tech ambitions but it turns out to be so 1950s.<br />And why does  the heroine not only have a great body but a tongue that can perform  amazing feats?  Geez.  <br />If you're desperate for something that won't tax  your own brain cells and you like reading about vaporized brain stuff, go  for it.	2000-06-06

This is basic body building repackaged with a high protein diet.

But how many people are actually going to stick to this?   Yeah, yeah, I got suckered into buying this book cause everybody everywhere  is talking about it.  But being a veteran of the diet wars (anyone remember  the grapefruit diet the first time around?), I should have known better.  <br />There are NO magic bullets and NO magic cures.  Losing weight is tough,  hard work.  This author isn't saying anything you haven't heard before:   eat less and exercise.  It's just got a very slick package going for it.

But I was pleasantly surprised.  While parts of the book were a little dull and slow, the  overall setting kept things moving along quite nicely.  Of course the  author makes heavy use of some pretty standard hooks:  sex, Japanese  history, drugs, sex, violent death, basic murder mystery plot, sex and  naked women.  But hey, this is a supermarket book, you kind of expect that  in a paperback bestseller.<br />There was too much about nothing concerning  the heroine.

Gaffney delivers all that and little else in this very familiar book (been there done that).  Yes,  breast cancer is a terrible, terrible disease.  But its devastating effects  have been written about so much better so many other places.  You just KNEW  that in a group of women, one of them is bound to have breast cancer and  deal with it nobly and with grace and without the upclose and horrific  aspects of chemotherapy (other than a single night of nausea and some hair  loss).  I didn't feel anything when this character appeared other than  fully manipulated by the author.<br />You also could just guess from the  opening pages the defining aspects of each of these characters' lives from  issues about children to emotional abuse and failing marriages.  There was  absolutely nothing new here.  In addition, I found little difference  between each of the characters' supposed chapters other than the chapter  headings. <br />If you liked Beaches and/or if you are a fan of this author,  you may fully enjoy this book.  But if you're looking for a good read about  strong women, you won't find it here.	2000-06-06

The author is certainly an inspiration and a role model.  I absolutely love how she promotes simply moving your body despite your size.  In this thin-obsessed society, it is incredible to find somebody who promotes  health over thinness.  That alone is worth the price of the book and worth  keeping it on your shelf after you're done reading it.  How we women HATE  our bodies.  How USELESS is that emotion.  Molnar is telling us something  wonderful, not new maybe, but wonderful -- love what you got and do all you  can with it.<br />For somebody like me who is overweight, middleaged , and has  a few chronic but not horrible health issues, it was absolutely  motivational to read about this.  If I want to dance my heart out or run a  marathon or run around with my dogs, the only person really stopping myself  is me. Molnar's common sense solutions to some of her own issues plus her  allowing herself to be important enough to have coaches and trainers helped  me to realize that any obstacle I may encounter can be addressed.<br />My big  criticism with this book is that the author WAS a lifelong athlete before  her weight gain.  So returning to hard exercise may have been a challenge  but it was also something she had a real passion for under all that weight.   For a born and bred couch potato who would rather read than walk ANYWHERE,  I had trouble identifying with her reawakening.  In addition, Molnar is  still very young and her advice is really geared to 20 or 30 somethings.   Us middleaged folk are sort of left in the dust.  <br />For those reasons, I  wasn't overjoyed with this book.  But kudos to the author.  You go girl!	2000-06-06

The plot line itself  unfortunately got more and more implausible as it was unraveled.  But that  didn't detract too much from the story.  <br />It was wonderful to read about  a woman who was of independent financial means and to learn how she got  there.  But would that it would be so easy to lose weight simply because  you don't like the way you look and you decide not to eat so much!  I  didn't quite get that whole aspect of the plot and  it seemed to get A LOT  of unnecssary play. In addition, that strong independent woman is also  portrayed as being rather unnattractive and socially isolated as well as  being chunky.  Such unfortunate and untrue stereotypes.  How refreshing if  that had been turned on its head.<br />Still, this is a definite  add-to-the-beach-bag book.  Don't expect anything deep or heavy -- think  Die Hard with amnesia and you get the idea.  Fast and easy reading!	2000-06-06

It was the only book I could lay my hands on.  And it was bad, very bad, very, very, very bad.  How do people get so lucky as to have something this  horrible get published?<br />I got seduced by all the hype on the cover, but  if Belva Plain is &quot;an accomplished storyteller&quot; it must have been  17 books ago 'cause it ain't this one!<br />The book offers absolutely nothing  new.  No surprises.  No insights about the frailty of human nature.  No  inspired writing.  Not even any inspired sex scenes.  Nothing.  What you do  get:  a non-existent plot about a lawyer (gee, has that been done before?),  stilted writing and the worst sin of all -- unlikeable characters.  Not one  of them was anyone I cared about, not even remotely.<br />But the writing!   Who writes like this?  &quot;She would come virginal to the marriage.&quot;   In 1970s America?  Yeah sure.  Who talks like this with all the do nots  (instead of don't) and an EXCESSIVE use of darling.  I have never heard  anyone anywhere call anyone darling unless it was dripping with sarcasm.   This book reads like a British costume drama set down in what is supposed  to be greedy contemporary America.  Didn't buy it for a second.<br />And the  whole &quot;retarded boy&quot; thing.  I mean talk about lack of  sensitivity and heavy handedness.  I bet a lot of readers will be rightly  and deeply offended by how this was handled.  It offered no sensitivity and  no insight into this.  You want a book about a family reeling from the  impact of a disabled child?  Read Sue Miller's Family Pictures -- now  there's a book!<br />And what exactly was this book supposed to be about?  A  morality tale?  For whom?  About what?  People spent way too much time  having a stiff upper lip and tending to appearances.  Was that supposed to  be the bad thing?  But then not everybody got their compeuppance for that.   Just some.  What a pointless mess.<br />And finally, a huge HUGE revelation at  the end that was breathtaking in its enormity to the rest of the plot and  it is discarded within pages.  Talk about a stupid ending.  Talk about a  stupid book.  Somebody should tell Belva to take a break.	2000-06-06

The New York Times isn't lying when it calls this book &quot;a big, fat happy feast of a book...&quot;  It makes the perfect beach, vacation, airplane book (especially those coast-to-coast  flights).<br />The author's slightly sardonic tone works well here and drew me  in from the first sentence.  How refreshing to identify with a novel's  character because she is FALLIBLE in many all-too human ways.  The author  also deftly meshes the current story with an engrossing and wonderfully  written backstory then brings them together wonderfully at the end.<br />While  the heroine is in truth one of those Danielle Steele characters of beauty,  brains, and wealth, it takes you a while to figure that out.  Her flaws and  dysfunctional history make her believable and enjoyable.  I never once  wanted to BE the heroine, but I sure enjoyed reading about her.  Along the  way, Isaacs makes some rather interesting observations of what makes a  family and what &quot;family&quot; really means, especially in today's  society.  What an unusual thing to find in a &quot;mass market  paperback.&quot;	2000-06-03

The author heaps so many bad things on the main character you start to guess exactly what is going to happen before it does.  Despite  all this calamity, however, the heoroine never seems to change or grow.   The other people in the book are pretty much stock characters:  the  inattentive, incompetent doctor, the town drunk, the pinch-mouthed  mother-in-law, etc.  In addition, this is a familiar tale of hard scrabble  existence and survival in the face of all.  It has been told elsewhere and  much better.  Check out:  MY DROWNING.	2000-02-10

The quality of the photos is simply outstanding, making the moon shot feel like it just happened yesterday not 30 years ago.  It brought back all the goosebumps I felt as a highschooler when the astronauts first stepped on the moon.  Presenting the pictures  separate from the text makes you focus entirely on the visual before you.  The foldouts are so impressive and encompassing.<br />In addition, the essay  answered basic questions about the space program brought up by the photos  but kept it short enough to not read like a history book.  This is a book  I'll return to again and again.  Already I have run after friends, book in  hand, shouting, &quot;Look at this one!  Look at THIS!&quot;  A fabulous  additon to anyone's library but most especially for anyone with even the  slightest interest in the space program.

That makes us of different generations making her personal anecdotes difficult to relate to.  In  addition, I don't have a great career, I'm  not married, I don't live in a  large metropolitan &amp; cosmopolitan area, I don't have a group of  fabulous girlfriends to drink wine and compare stories with, and I don't  have kids (and likely never will) so again, I found a lot to not bond about  with the author.<br />The opening chapter, however, was wonderful and had me  howling in my chair.  I hoped that fun would be maintained throughout the  book.  Instead, I felt the book spent too much time talking about  superficial aspects of aging like eating right, exercising, and keeping  your mind alert by trying new things (well, duh!).  She also completely  overlooks the more spiritual aspects of mortality in favor of political  discussions about women in society (important but not what I'm needing  right now). There was a rather graphic description of a breast bioposy  which was riveting (the author holds nothing back there and thank you for  that)    Maybe in another five years I'll connect better instead of finding  this to read very much like an irritating upbeat &quot;how-to-be a glowing  senior citizen article&quot; out of Good Housekeeping Magazine. For now,  I'd recommend Awakening at Midlife by Kathleen Brehony.	2000-01-25

I knew what this book was SUPPOSED to be about but I was only confused by it.  The author offers little in the way of personal insight or growth, instead tossing out disconnected facts about her life, and Mairs puts a lot  of those into this reflection on her own life:  her illnesses, her  husband's infidelity &amp; cancer, her conversion to Catholocism.  Interesting as it all is (and she does have the occasional poetic thought)  it doesn't really hang together or go anywhere.  I never really got WHY she  converted to Catholocism (which is why I picked up the book to begin with)  or why she stays there or with her husband.  There doesn't seem to be an  overriding point to this book other than the author musing about her  dysfunctional self and the dysfunctional life she has created and  maintains.<br />Some chapters were tremendously moving and like hearing a  voice in the wilderness.  Your heart leaps towards that lovely,  heartbreaking voice only to find it continually retreating from you and  leaving nothing behind to nourish you. She offers little for the reader to  use and learn from, not even a particularly unique perspective, which is  usually the point to any kind of memoir, isn't it?<br />In the end, I found  this to be more like a vanity piece and myself rather purient to be  nibbling on the tidbits of the author's life.	2000-01-25

Here is the private eye I'd want solving my case!  I loved that the hero was in fact an amazonian heroine, albeit with some terrible weaknesses.

And talk about  a heart throb to swoon for, where are the real Atticus Kodiaks?  Whoo boy.   Somebody who will respect me AND wait for me but still manages to wear a  bunch of earrings and maybe have some serious flaws to keep him human?   Wow!<br />I do have some little quibbles, though.  The basic plot and the  violence are pretty much the same private eye stuff but then this IS a  private eye book.  The violence, while visceral, was all entirely  believable and never gratuitous.  Some of the character names were a  stretch and made me wince a little.  But hey those are small complaints.   At first the abrubt switch to the Atticus voice was disruptive and  disappointing.  But I got used to it, tho I still think I would have  enjoyed it more if it had stayed entirely with Bridgett.  The ending also  seemed to drag a little from the intitial hot pace of the book, just a  little too many twists and turns.  But still, a good read.

Like many of the books in Oprah's Book Club, it was a decent read but I was never swept away by it.  Probably because I could never really identify with any of the  characters.  Particularly the lead character with the martyr complex who  never seems to change or grow despite the significant occurances in her  life. While she becomes aware of difficulties or issues in her life or with  her family, it all goes pretty much unaddressed while she focuses on her  daughter to the exclusion of all else. On the other hand, non-sentimental  stories about families rearing children with handicaps are hard to find and  I think this book qualifies as one.  But it was not an INSPIRATIONAL  tale.   Most of the characters were irritating and the daughter never becomes a  fully realized character.  ALL people with handicaps, regardless of their  level of functioning, are real, full human beings.  It is a shame the  author only manages to communicate the burden and stigma of having this  child.  And is Mississippi really that bad?	2000-01-09

But if you want to read her best work, read Life Before Man, not this unnecessairily dense and pointless tome. I have felt that ever since Atwood &quot;sold out&quot; to Hollywood for the HORRIBLE, SOULESS film of Handmaid's Tale, she has lost something  significant as an artist and this book simply proves that.  I was  especially disappointed by the TEAM of people she had working for her on  this book.  Is that how ART is created these days?  With corporate  teamwork?  I have been shocked at the great reviews for this book.  As if  people have been blinded by the sheer size of the book and Atwood's  reputation.  Don't buy into that.  If you must read this book (and believe  me, you won't miss anything by not) save your money and get it from the  library.
