US	51973726	R1OJHC1K1FI5O7	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Questions and Observations for Half-Blood Prince Readers	First, I'm giving this book five stars, because even a transitional HP book is more fun to read, more exciting and harder to put down, than most other books.  I am an adult reader who enjoys YA novels along with other genres, and I still think the HP series is a rival with any other YA series that exists (including Lewis).    I read the book in a day, as did a lot of reviewers.  My favorite is still the first one, but I enjoyed this one very much.    1.  I loved the opening with the Prime Minister, and thought it very funny.  But I was disappointed that there was no later \\"payoff.\\"  It would be great to see the Muggle world more active in this crucial fight.    2.  We're still getting hints about Petunia that haven't really been explained.  I keep thinking there's more to this than we've been shown.  I'm going to be a little bit disappointed if there isn't.    3.  Once again, Rowling introduces a new and interesting professor.  I really enjoyed Slughorn.  He is one of the first teachers to appreciate Hermione's abilities.  OK, so he's vain and a little name-dropping, but he isn't evil.  I found him interesting and thought he was a great addition to the staff.  And his affection for Harry's mother seemed very genuine, and that was great to see, too.    4.  I was glad that Fleur and Bill stayed together, and that Rowling basically showed that even good people like the Weasleys can be mistaken.  It would have been tiresome if Fleur was shown to be two-faced because it would have been like saying that Beautiful = Bad.    5.  Anyone else wonder if Snape had a soft spot for Narcissa?    6.  Why is Tom Riddle so very evil?  Is it because his father never loved his mother?  In a way it's nice that we don't create any sympathy for Tom, as he can't be \\"redeemed\\" as Voldemort after all he's done, but in another way it's so strange.    7.  I felt very sad for his mother, Merope.    8.  I was delighted that we saw a deeper side to Draco.  This seems more like the Draco from BookOne, who was jealous but not monstrous.  I'm hoping that this is a clue that Snape, who had said Draco and Harry were not unlike Snape and James, is not really the traitor he seems to be.  Also, I felt sorry for Narcissa when she was pleading with Snape.  Seems that death-eaters can also love.  Interesting development and a promising one.    9.  I don't think Snape is completely explained yet.  Admittedly I can't understand why he took the unbreakable vow knowing it might lead to this, if he's on the Good side, but on the other hand as he was running away he was still teaching Harry and I felt there was more to this.  I have always liked Snape and I still trust Dumbledore's judgement.    10.  R.A.B. = Regulus Black?  If that's the case, then the horcrux would be in the Black house, and Harry should own it.    11.  Harry is one of the horcruxes, I think.    12.  Re the romance:  on the one hand it was true to life, but on another, there was a bit too much of it.  But I certainly don't agree with the reviewers who found it was too sexual.  It was very very mild.  The Ginny-Harry thing has been prepped in earlier books but felt very sudden anyway.    13.  The main conflict seems to exist *only* in Europe.  Anyone else find that odd?  If it's really a battle for the fate of the world, shouldn't there be wizards from Asia, Africa and America?  Of course there haven't been so far, so it wasn't something that bothered me while reading, but I do wonder.    14.  The house-elves seemed to be dropped in and then dropped out.  Having Kreacher and Dobby trail Draco didn't lead to anything much.    15.  I want more of Luna.  In the last book, she was wacky but often right.  This time, her \\"rightness\\" were her own observations, but the magical theories were all crackpot.  I wanted some more \\"insider\\" knowledge.    16.  This book made me laugh out loud in several places!  Many of the reviewers don't seem to \\"get\\" her humor.  For example:     And Odo the hero, they bore him back home  To the place that he'd known as a lad,     (sang Slughorn plaintively).    They laid him to rest with his hat inside out  And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.    \\"Which was sad\\" as the afterthought rhyme is one of the funniest things i've ever read.  Too good.    17.  Do we ever find out who was \\"whooping\\" in the room of requirement that Trelawney overheard?    18.  Slughorn finds all of Harry's \\"cheats\\" remind him of Harry's mother.  We know the book belonged to Snape, but was he getting help from Lily, or helping her himself?  I think there's more to learn about this book, Snape, and the past.    Overall... this book was the biggest cliffhanger yet (for example did we even find out how Dumbledore burned his hand?).  It will be a long hard wait!	2005-07-18

But I thought it was juvenile and easy. I'm not Christian, so it's not that I was offended on a personal level.  I just thought the comedy or the attempts at it was just one joke retold over and over again.  We're presented with an ancient world as corrupt, shallow and lustful as anything in the contemporary world, which is fine, but each description of someone at an orgy is treated as though it's full of Meaning.   The repeated point was also clumsy and heavy handed.   <br /> <br />The plot, such as it is, involves Saint Timothy, a disciple of Paul, being visited by television execs from the future, warning him that the \\"Hacker\\" is erasing all the \\"tapes\\" and his gospel will be the only one left. <br /> <br />In other words, Vidal doesn't even trust us to draw the analogies to the present ourselves, but has to actually infuse the ancient world with the present to be sure we \\"get\\" it. <br /> <br />And what's to get?  Entertainment distorts the news, anybody will sell out for the right price, religion is a business?  Is this supposed to be startling insight? <br /> <br />Tom Wolfe this isn't.  No penetrating parody here, just silly schoolboy humor, taking potshots at easy targets.  Very disappointed, and hope this isn't typical of Vidal's work.  Another reviewer wrote that this is a great introduction to his work, and if that's so, I won't be reading him again.	2005-07-09

The summaries posted here have more \\"plot\\" in them than is easily gleaned from the book.  Because the stream of consciousness leaps from character to character, it's hard to know the relationships let alone see who is flirting with whom and why it matters.  You do figure it out but it takes too long to figure out which characters go with which names. <br /> <br />There is a lovely portrait of an English village in 1939, and the heartbreaking innocent pageant of English history portrayed, but really, you can get such atmosphere from the series Mystery-- and there you get a plot as well.  I think this is not a good introduction to Woolf, as it takes certain kinds of experimentation and heightens it.  At least with Mrs. Dalloway you see things for the most part from one point of view and come to care about it. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this, but then I'm in theatre, so I enjoyed all of the description of the pageant.  This is a little bit like reading the equivalent of a home movie, it's pretty, but you don't know the people portrayed well enough to really care.	2005-07-09

I thought I was in for a gentle novel about learning to value life, with a little hint of something spooky-- to be honest, the kind of thing I don't usually enjoy, but the writer had been praised in a book group so I thought I'd try it out. <br /> <br />But what I got instead was an exciting, gripping tale of love across time, a ghost story, a historical novel dealing with a little-known eugenics program in Vermont (who knew that Nazis claimed to get their inspiration from American eugenics bills!  not me!) and well-- yes, life and love, but told with so much humor, clarity and vivid language that I truly could not put the book down.  I stayed up until 5 AM to read it. <br /> <br />Examples:  when the little town of Comstook becomes haunted, odd things happen like coffeemakers will only brew lemonade, rose petals fall from the air, photographs float off of development paper.  These are tiny details but the author's invention is so generous that they stand out. <br /> <br />The first couple of chapters are a little confusing, as there are multiple points of view, but stick with it:  all becomes clear.  In fact this is one of those books that when you get to the end you want to go back to the beginning, because now that the clues are filled in the early parts and the connections have even more interest. <br /> <br />On top of all THAT, this is a great murder mystery, complete with forensic detail and investigation worthy of any in the L&O universe.  The supernatural stuff is both funny and elegant.  In short this is one of the best books I've read in a long time-- as much plot and excitement as any lightweight read, but written elegantly, sparely and with a lot to chew on afterwards.  This is the kind of book that reminds you again why you like to read-- it has as much invention and wit as any good YA novel but as much depth and insight as any serious adult novel.  This is the first Picoult I've read but definitely will NOT be the last!	2005-06-24

The contrast was stunning!  Gypsyworld just draws you right in and doesn't let you go until the end. <br /> <br />The gypsies, Josip and Marina, have purchased or stolen five teenagers to bring to Gypsyworld-- an alternate world that seems to coexist with earth.  We don't know why, but we can't help liking jolly Josip and Marina.  Eventually we realize that, like the series the 4400 running now on TV, the kids are going to be the ones to try to save the earth-- not because they're special, but precisely because they aren't.  If they can be coaxed into caring about the environment, anybody can. <br /> <br />Anyway, it's a fun story of how the five kids bond and learn.  I did find the gypsies themselves much more interesting and entertaining than the teens, and would have liked more of them, but this is a really fun and thought-provoking book, with a gentle heart.	2005-06-23
US	51973726	R2LX4NTZQQ6FQE	0786887060	301892189	Trading Up	Books	3	0	3	N	N	Fascinating, off-beat chick-lit	It's absolutely true that the main character, Janey Wilcox, is a superficial, shallow user.  Bear in mind though that the author clearly sees her the same way, and never intends you to identify with Janey.  The novel pays hommage to Wharton's The House of Mirth is several clever ways... and like the protagonist there, Janey is not admirable but still merits some sympathy as she tries to create the glamorous life for herself she thinks she deserves.  She's very flawed, but never malicious... most of the time she's deep in denial, and the author's unstinting look at her psyche is very well craftedl. <br /> <br />none of the characters in the book, with the possible exception of Janey's sister Patty, a sweetheart married to a rock star, is really all that likable.  But it's a fascinating world, with its money, duplicity and superficiality.  Like a lot of readers here I wouldn't care to read another book centered around the strivings of such a vain and basically silly person, but in her own world, Janey's really not much worse than a lot of the people around her, and it was good to see her triumph.  In that respect, this book really does share a lot with Wharton's world-- Wharton also was highly critical of the two-faced world of rich manners, where men can get away with betrayals  of mammoth proportions while a woman trying to make it without the benefit of pedigree, using her beauty, will always be walking on the borderline. <br /> <br />Read the book without attempting to identify with janey and you can enjoy it for its real merits!  This is not the usual chick-lit, where the central character is lovable, like Bridget Jones... or rather, she is lovable, but in a pitying kind of way.	2005-06-18

What a terrific premise:  the adult children of a couple who wrote a Joy of Sex (complete with artist-drawn illustrations) type sex manual, using themselves as models, twenty-five years later. <br /> <br />The book opens when the children discover their parents' book, in the seventies.  That scene is hilarious and appalling, and conjures up the seventies so perfectly. <br /> <br />Part of the novel's forward-motion has to do with a proposed reiusse of the book-- the parents, now divorced, are divided about it, and one of the children is called upon to convince the father to go through with it.  However, by this point, we seem to have left the initial subject behind somehow.  All of the characters are well-drawn and sympathetic, and it's a great look at how people are defined and programmed by their childhood and their family, but at a certain point it could be any family, not just the children of the famous sex-book couple.  The ending for example seemed inconclusive-- as life often is, I suppose-- but it was lacking, for me. <br /> <br />All in all, this book is not as perfectly cohesive and structured as Wolitzer's phenomenal The Wife, but it's still very well written and a terrific read.  And for the first two-thirds of the book, it's a perceptive look at how social mores have changed since the seventies.  I was a child then-- a little younger than the adult children of the novel-- and a lot of it rang so true for me.  Wolitzer is an excellent writer, very vivid and sympathetic, and this is well worth a read.	2005-06-14

The book is neatly divided by Austen's books:  each chapter is the book of the month, and depending on which member of the book club is hosting, the chapter focuses on that indivdual's story. <br /> <br />Obviously, you'll get more out of this if you've read most of Austen's oevre, because not only are the characters discussing the books, but the book itself is a meta-novel in which the characters in the club go through very Austen-like romances, reconciliations and turmoils. <br /> <br />It's a very quick read, but some characters were far more compelling than others, and at times I wanted more of the Jane Austen commentary than we got... in other words, some of the chapters were more seamless in combining the book-club conceit with the characters' real lives than others.  It also seemed to wrap up too neatly, too quickly.  But I've given it four stars because the quality of the writing is excellent and some sections were very memorable.  A good summer read for English majors!	2005-06-14

It's basically an \\"alternative history,\\" set in early 19th-century England, but an England in which a former half-fairy king is accepted as part of the past the way we accept that Alfred the great existed. <br /> <br />You'll enjoy this more if you've read Austen, Sterne and other eighteenth and nineteenth century writers, because Clarke has caught the style to a t-- even with archaic spelling.  But the story moves along at an excellent pace. <br /> <br />There is real magic at work-- it's delightful when Strange, one of the magicians (and at first, a student to the stuffy but rather dear, though pompous, Mr. Norrell) works for Wellington and ends up creating enchanted roads and moving Brussells around in order to confound the French, for example. <br /> <br />Another lovely element of the book is the whole other world of Faerie.  If you listen to old ballads you'll see that that world is often a very frightening, sad place, and so it is in this book-- the \\"gentleman with the thistle-down hair\\" is charming, funny and altogether amoral and bloodthirsty.  Being stolen away to his world of \\"lost-hope\\" is to be forced to participate in dreary balls and processions-- part of the joke is that their dreariness and the humans' response to them is utterly missed by the Gentleman, who can only perceive that it must delight them as it delights him.  The sad bells and mournful tunes of Faerie contribute to the atmosphere. <br /> <br />The invention of John Unksglass, the legendary Raven King, is so convincing you find yourself forgetting at times that no such history existed. <br /> <br />The ending disappointed me a little bit, but perhaps it means there's room for a sequel? <br /> <br />Altogether a charming book.  It really isn't \\"Harry Potter for adults\\" stylistically, but like that book, the book tells of the education of magicians.  Wholly original and entertaining.	2005-06-14

Bought this at the airport to read on a beach trip, and boy did it suit the bill!  Funny, light, snappy, with just enough deeper emotions to make it feel worthwhile. This was my first Marian Keyes, but it won't be the last.  This book tells the  story of three different women in Dublin and London, all connected to each other:  Gemma, whose father suddenly leaves her mother for a younger woman after over thirty years of marriage (and primarily tells her story at first via emails to a friend in Seattle); Lily, the writer who \\"stole Anton\\"-- Gemma's former boyfriend (and that story looks very very different from Lily's point of view) who has a surprise bestseller with a new age novel about a white wish who makes people feel better, and JoJo, the American hot-shot editor having an affair with her boss.  Of all of them, tough Jojo was the least sympathetic and the least believable.  Still it was fascinating to see aspects of the story from three different perspectives, and I found the book hard to put down.  All three women are likable and you understand what drives them.  Just as you're sure you're going to hate one of them, based on how they appear in the other's story, the narrative switches to them and you can't hate them at all! <br /> <br />All the women are dealing with love, career, and \\"finding themselves,\\" and it's handled differently and entertainingly throughout.  Keyes, who I think I have read articles by in various writer magazines, is a very good writer-- some of the bits made me laugh out loud, especially Lily's hilarious photo shoot for her book jacket where the photographer had her literally swinging from trees, to the vast amusement of a gathering group of schoolboys.  Chick lit that is well done, in the real mode of Helen Fielding and Bridget Jones.  There is even, for the beach-readers, a short section set at an all-inclusive!  These are nice gals to pal around with when you want to be diverted, and Keyes' prose is colorful and entertaining.  I'll definitely be reading more of hers!	2005-05-31

But somehow it was very forgettable.  I began it on a plane ride back from vacation.  After I got home, i put it down for a full week before finishing it.  I suspect it's more enjoyable if you're a twenty-something than a late thirty-something. <br /> <br />Rachel is a people-pleaser, a sweet girl who's been in the shadow of her pretty best friend Darcy since childhood.  Nobody is more suprised than she is when she ends up sleeping with Dex, Darcy's fiancee, on her thirtieth birthday.  It's even more surprising that this fling grows into a full-fledged and serious romance. <br /> <br />Except... it was Rachel who introduced Darcy to Dex in the first place.  Dex went to law school with Rachel, and it's strongly implied that only Rachel's low self-esteem kept her from picking up on Dex's obvious crush in the first place. <br /> <br />Darcy is a shallow, vain creature with few redeeming qualities, so although we're told about the friendship, it's hard to understand why it's taken Rachel so long to see that Darcy has been undermining her since ever.  On a trip to London to see an old friend Rachel gets some insight on earlier betrayals Darcy has made, including for example Darcy's lying that she was accepted into the school Rachel wanted to go to (Notre Dame) but just chose Indiana anyway. <br /> <br />There's something generic about the characters... their originally coming from Indiana doesn't make them more interesting. <br /> <br />For all that, I did relate to Rachel, and though the ending smacks of wish-fulfillment I enjoyed it anyway.     And it's definitely a good book to read if you're in a thrilling but illicit relationship, because Rachel spares herself no punches and the book carries the full roller-coaster excitement and dread of such encounters without lapsing into easy moralism.   <br /> <br />This is solid, good, fluffy chick-lit... not in the league of Marian Keyes (who offered a lovely book-jacket blurb for the author) but much better than a lot of what's out there.	2005-05-31

Both of my parents are from New England, and I've spent some time in both Cape Cod and Connecticut.  I expected to enjoy this much more than I did. <br /> <br />It's written well and impeccably researched.  But the forward motion really meanders, with only the question \\"will the house stay in the family or be sold?\\" to keep you reading.  It makes sense that the author then tries to describe his family, to keep you invested. <br /> <br />But, though the author clearly adores his extended family, they never became vivid to me.  He keeps telling us how charming and \\"attractive\\" (the highest WASP compliment) they are, but I keep saying people who are cold, antisemitic (a section where a mother  refuses to let a duaghter who's married a Jewish man stay at the house is glossed over as if the genteel antisemitism is just another trait of a vanishing society). <br /> <br />The house itself does fascinate.  Colt is most interesting when he writes about himself-- my favorite section was the section where he describes the books in the house. <br /> <br />I think the book will mean a lot more to you if you either are from that area (try as he might Colt never succeeded in making Wings Neck sound appealing to me-- full of rocks, poison ivy, weeds, and inscrutable people)... or know the world he's writing about. <br /> <br />Somehow Colt does NOT succeed in evoking the WASP-y glamour that for example playwright A.R. Gurney does with plays like The Dining Room (Colt mentions a scene from this play in his book). <br /> <br />Instead we see people with an enormous sense of entitlement, histories of mental illness, nice manners, cheapness, and not a whole lot of industry.  (Hint:  the house's fate ultimately resides in the Jewish upstart...) <br /> <br />They don't come across as horrible people, but neither does their way of life really seem worth preserving.  Still, it's an interesting if occasionally baffling bit of history.	2005-05-17

There's no question that the authors know the world they're satirizing inside and out, and at first it's fascinating to have an entree into the world of High Society.  But that fascination isn't enough to carry a whole book (especially when other books take on the same world:  The Nanny Diaries and Bergdorf Blondes). <br /> <br />Melanie Korn is a sweet bubble-headed blonde who's way out of her league.  But unlike say the heroine of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, another book about a social-climbing gal, she lacks the humor and irreverance to make her vulgarity really likable.  The shifting points of view and multiple narrative threads don't help-- there's a really nasty sub-plot about a neighbor who wants to kill his Latina mistress.  The book wants us to sympathize only with him as she's portrayed as a terrifying shrew, but the snobbery is ingrained in the narrative throughout.   <br /> <br />Then, once Melanie has her dreams dashed, I kept waiting to see her somehow triumph anyway and make it to the Top via a surprising strategy.  Instead the moral of the story is there's more to Manhattan than  just a few blocks, that people live on the West Side, that love and marriage and children are Good.  Well, duh.  The last thirty pages of the book were a homily to the joys of the Real World-- it's well meant but terribly condescending.  Where do they think their readers live? <br /> <br />The two mean gossips who narrate some of the book are tiresome, and never get the comeuppance they really deserve. <br /> <br />I gave this two stars because it's such a missed opportunity.  With better editing and direction this could have been a sort of Jane Austen type book for our times.  Instead, it's just a minor example of gossip lit. <br /> <br />The prose is fair-- better than The Devil Wears Prada but nowhere near the humor and elegance of The Nanny Diaries. <br /> <br />It's a quick read, but there are better quick reads out there.  On the plus side, the book does leave you feeling grateful the world of High Society is so very irrelevant.  Ah, you say as you shut it, thank goodness I am middle class!	2005-05-17

Still, you can't help hoping... <br /> <br />Ainvar is resourceful and likable.  At times the elegaic tone for the Celts (\\"we were a people who sang\\") is a bit twee, and it's true the Romans are presented as out and out villains which oversimplifies the story.  There are also a few loose ends-- a kidnapped daughter's fate and the betrayal by a friend. <br /> <br />But on the whole this is an engrossing story with a sense of historical accuracy, and a must read for anyone interested in Celts and ancient Rome.  Llewelyn's prose is a treat and she writes engaging characters throughout.	2005-01-28

Don't be fooled by the title into thinking it's some kind of science fiction rom, a la Jasper Ffordes (who is wonderful, btw):  this is a naturalistic story of a man, Henry DeTamble, afflicted with the inability to stay in the present.<br /><br />Does time-traveling sound like fun?  It isn't (though the book is a treat).  As DeTamble experiences it, it's an affliction:  He arrives naked in whatever time he travels to, generally into a world with no comprehension of his affliction (it's hinted that it's a genetic disorder that will find popular comprehension in the second decade of the 21st century); he faces danger of all sorts when he travels, and has a lot of explaining to do in the world he travels from.  Oh... and he has absolutely no control over his destination.<br /><br />It's like a vivid kind of narcolepsy.  DeTamble, a librarian, explains to his employers (who often find him naked in the stacks) that he's afflicted with something like epilepsy. The one bright spot is his repeated travels to a meadow in Michigan where he encounters his future wife Clare, from age six on.  To add to the complexity, Henry is powerless to change events, and because he's in his forties when he meets Clare, who is six, she knows a lot more about their history than he does when she encounters him finally in the present when she's twenty and he's twenty-eight.<br /><br />But love will find a way-- and this is a luminous, beautiful, aching love story.  Apart from Henry's affliction, there's nothing magical in their world except the magic of every day life, here rendered vividly and poignantly.  The meeting of the family for the first time, for instance, is a recognizable scene only exacerbated by Henry's fear that he will slip into another time at any moment.<br /><br />Henry's family history is also interesting; his mother was a famous opera singer who died in a horrific car crash with Henry in the car when he was six; his father an accomplished violinist.  One of the small consolations Henry receives from his disability is the opportunity to see his mother alive-- standing next to her on a train or passing her on the street.<br /><br />This is a marvelous book about memory and life-- it reminds me of the glorious last section of Our Town in which Emily returns to life for just one day and can't bear the amount of beauty and inattention to that beauty she sees everywhere.<br /><br />Clare and Henry's love is unusual but redemptive and wholly convincing.

I read this for the section dealing with expatriates in Prague-- here called \\"Prava.\\"  If you spent any time there in the nineties, you'll see a lot of in-jokes and satire that may cause you to chuckle-- the Prague Post here named Prava-dence, Cafe Radost called Joy, and so on. <br /> <br />But in truth that section is not what the book is \\"about\\" (nor is there a lot of detail about it)-- it's a comic/dark fantasy coming-of-age that takes on America, Russia, Central Europe-- none of it terribly deeply.  It's sort of a Russian Philip Roth-- Girshkin's ruminations on women and sex take up a lot of the book and they are remarkably unerotic; sex seems to be all animal smells and bodily fulids. <br /> <br />The story of an American/Russian boy (Like the author, the protagonist moved to America as a child) who for complicated reasons ends up in Central Europe as an entrepreneurial mafioso is episodic, wordy, intermittently funny but ultimately oddly uninvolving.   <br /> <br />This got ecstatic reviews and awards when it came out, and there's no doubt that Shteyngart writes well, but the comparisons to Waugh are misplaced.  Waugh was concise-- Shteyngart goes on, and on, and on.  This book would be a lot more fun if it were a solid 150 pages shorter. <br /> <br />As it is, had I not been interested in the Prague satire, I think i'd have stopped reading-- this kind of blood-and-semen boy-into-man comedy is not something I usually enjoy. <br /> <br />Like Philip Roth, whose Portnoy's Complaint is so well written but kind of gross, I will keep an eye on Shteyngart and read him again.  If you like that kind of story, you'll like this too.	2005-01-01

One description of sleeping huddled in a school cot under a blanket that hovered several inches above her \\"like a benificent mold\\" really got my attention... sounded like every institutional (camp, school) bed I'd ever been in. <br /> <br />However, after awhile the cleverness overhwhelmed the plot.  I liked the narrator, but the hijacking memory goes on so long, and the conditions are so bleak/gross, that it's like being trapped there yourself (a description of some particularly awful food was sort of like cruelty to the reader).  Ultimately this kind of quirky, clever plotting became too tiresome and I lost the thread of the meaning and the larger significance. <br /> <br />Should Julavits try something a little more conventional though I'd be there in a heartbeat.  Definitely a writer to watch!	2004-12-24

The grief of Anna's 6-year-old daughter Lily is palpable because she's trying to be so brave; the stress her friend Estella, who lives in Amsterdam but has come to help, and Paul, her gay friend who acts as a surrogate father to Lily, are under is movingly portrayed.  Unfortunately however these chapters don't move the story forward very much because very quickly the reader knows more about what could have happened to Anna than Estella, from whose point of view the \\"home\\" sections are written. <br />The other thing that sets the novel apart is that the \\"away\\" sections present two parallel possible stories, in both of which a phone call is made home at a certain time, a toy horse is bought and then damaged, and other details match up.  In one, Anna is abducted by an Italian stranger who seems to be madly obsessed with his late wife. In another, Anna has a torrid affair with a man she met in the classified ads, who hides a sinister mystery. <br />Dunant at least spares us from the concept of having the narratives both be imaginings of her worried friends, and in the end it's not clear which version will be the one that Estella learns. <br />This gimmick is original and interesting but for me it ultimately doesn't work, because i found one so much more interesting than the other, and both more interesting than the \\"home\\" sections.   <br />Ultimately, I did enjoy this, but wasn't engrossed in it-- shifting between points-of-view and parallel universes was jarring.   <br /> <br />	2004-10-18

The book is told in the form of Christopher's journal, which is engaging and often funny.  The reader will understand a lot of things about Christopher's world long before he does... we know early on, for example, that the father has been lying about the mother's death, and we see that Christopher's inability to sense human emotion (lies, hesitation) keeps him in the dark about motivation, though he is so observant to detail that the world overwhelms him. <br /> <br />Christopher has to learn by heart, and the difficult way, such fundamental rules as \\"do not hit fellow students.\\"  It's not that Christopher is unemotional-- he's overwhelmed by it in fact. <br /> <br />Christopher ends up taking a harrowing journey to London, which as described is an enormous feat of will.  He's an unusual hero but a hero all the same.   <br /> <br />The short chapters and matter-of-fact style of the book make this a quick read.  The book is hard to put down, and Christopher's take on the world is haunting.	2004-10-14

What woman hasn't wished to keep a relationship with a man as arrogant and irresponsible as the reviewer who \\"blames\\" women  by reinterpreting the man's nastiness or unresponsiveness in the best possible light?  Once we fall in love, we want that love to work.    But ladies... it takes two to make love work.  And as Behrendt keeps pointing out, men hate to give women bad news, so they waffle.  But when the man reallyIS in love... it's very clear.    I admit, I fell in love with someone and made excuses for him because when he first was in love with me, he did do all those things Behrendt said a guy will do-- he called, he made the effort, he pursued, he was attentive.  So rather than paying attention to the change in his behavior... I made excuses.  Which is illogical, because I knew that he IS perfectly capable of calling, emailing, showing up, because he'd done it in the past.    We all want to be loved.  But when we try to fit a man-not-in-love into the -in-love slot, it doesn't fit, and we end up hurt.    This book ends up being a great laugh-- I had to read a lot of it out loud to friends-- and a self-esteem booster, too.      Liz occasionally tries to argue with Greg-- so you don't feel that he just doesn't understand women, because Liz is right there.    the \\"faux letter\\" and answer format is totally engaging.      It's a keeper!	2004-10-14

He's a real writer, and a terrific one, with an ear for the telling phrase, an eye for the incisive detail.  A memoirist to treasure.  Becuase of his deftness in writing and observation, it's plausible (if a long shot!) that he waltzed into an advertising job with no education and by age 25 was pulling well over six figures a year. <br /> <br />And it's also utterly logical that someone from his background would become a fall-down, functional drunk.  Dry is the story of his descent to the brink and his hilarious recovery in rehab-- he mocks it all the way and yet concedes that it works.  <br /> <br />It's also, surprisingly, a love story, and often a touching one, though it lacks a happy ending. <br /> <br />This is less episodic than Running with Scissors, and depending on your taste you'll either find it more cohesive or less original.  I'm not sure which I prefer-- maybe Running, but only because it was so out there and yet so comic-- and yet I have no doubt that this is as truthful, unsparing and funny a portrait of the lure of addiction than exists.  Burroughs has no self-pity; his justifiable anger at the outrageous behavior of his caregivers emerges seldom, and his humor and charm shine. <br /> <br />There's an excerpt from a third volume which seems to be another memoir, but this one focuses more on his life as an adman.  I can't wait.  Whatever he turns his hand to writing he captures in irresistable momentum; I read this in one day.  Burroughs is a writer to treasure.	2004-09-27

There is no \\"time delay\\" as you struggle to get used to a new protagonist and a new world; like Updike his sentences draw you right in and you're hooked. <br /> <br />But Boyle doesn't, like some contemporaries, write a \\"slice of life\\" that's all language and no story!  His stories have plot and often twists, including a likeable narrator who morphs into a killer before out eyes, a pair of teenage lovers who kill their baby, and the title story, set in a California following a devastating plague.  But the point is always the insight Boyle demonstrates through his vivid, compassionate writing. <br /> <br />Some of the stories are macabre and wickedly funny (Black and White Sisters, about a pair of eccentric women who have turned their whole world the color of old movies and spare no lengths to complete it; The Death of Cool about an aging tv producer), others are more poignant (Killing Babies, set in an abortion lab, Captured by the Indians, about a young grad student-wife struggling to come to terms with her husband and her future)-- all are inspiring. <br /> <br />Boyle's writing somehow makes the idea of writing accessible.  Like Fred Astaire, he makes it look easy.  He makes you want to sit down at the keyboard!  So it's a must not only for readers but for all writers, too.	2004-09-19

This book, like Loos', presents a silly, rather ditzy heroine without much individuality who is somehow likeable anyway.  Don't expect too much in the way of depth but enjoy it as a kindly satire, an extended magazine lampoon, and it can be great fun.  It probably won't teach you much about the search for love or give you any insight into the human character, but it will give you some funny jargon apparently spoken by the wealthy of the wealthiest young east-side \\"champagne bubble\\" girls about town! <br /> <br />The narrator (cleverly never named; she refers to herself as \\"moi\\") is a Bergdorf brunette-- it's her best friend Julie Bergdorf who is a blonde, with highlights that have to be updated every 13 days.  \\"Moi's\\" world is priveleged, incredibly wealth and cliquish and it's kind of fun to live vicariously in a world of PJ's (private jets) and exclusive Van Cleef and Arpels sample sales.   <br />Sykes clearly knows this world and there is good-natured satire throughout-- I have no doubt the author has more depth and savvy than her somewhat hapless narrator.  (it's one of the few false notes in the book that someone quite as shallow as the narrator has landed a writing job for Vogue; presumably she traded a bit on family connections...) <br /> <br />I only gave this three stars however because after a while it does seem a bit shrill.  We're told the narrator went to Princeton but she seems never to have encountered any \\"normal\\" people along the way-- which is hard to accept.  If she made it through an Ivy school (however motivated for admission by New York facials), then at some point in her life she had to work hard, get up at a decent hour, and produce.  Instead our narrator lives a carefree (well, mostly) life-- which is funny but doesn't ring true-- in which deadlines are flexible, wake-up is 10:30, and she generously doens't judge a girl if she wears last year's Manolo's. <br /> <br />The fairy-tale quality of the search for love is just a bit two neat-- unlike hapless Bridget Jones, there isn't a real inevitability to the handsome men (however rogueish) she keeps encountering until she finds Mr. Right.   <br /> <br />But the suicide attempt and the hilarious \\"farewell cruel world\\" email are almost worth the book price alone!   I enjoyed this a great deal-- I won't be rereading it (unlike Second Assistant and Nanny Diaries)-- but it was a very pleasant toe-dip into the world of the young, foolish and loaded!	2004-09-19

And if your pet was a witness to the person you loved most in the world, who died suddenly and mysteriously, it's easy to see how that could become an obsession.  Dr. Paul Iverson takes a year's sabbatical to focus on linguistic apprehension and communication in dogs-- because he wants his dog Lorelei, a noble Rhodesian ridgeback, to tell him what happened the day his beloved, few wife Lexy, a talented maskmaker, climbed to the top of an apple tree and fell out. <br /> <br />This is a terrific portrayal of grief-- from the way Paul idealizes Lexy early on to the way his darker memories of her are allowed to surface.  Yes he's holding back from us-- he knows a few significant facts about Lexy and the day before she died that he doesn't reveal until the end-- but he's probably repressing them himself, too.  Like Lorelei, who goes running through the house and barking in corners when Paul murmers \\"find Lexy,\\" Paul wishes to somehow change the past and bring Lexy home. <br /> <br />This is a hard book to put down, it's told very simply and the sense of suspense is palpable.  The prose style is down to earth and Paul has his own lyricism (as when he talks about grief and its long halls and empty rooms) that is very moving.  Lorelei is a terrific presence too.  I didn't always like Lexy-- but it's clear that Paul was bowled over by her.  Paul is so convincing that his project seems off-beat but possibly brilliant-- until you see for the first time how his house is looking through the eyes of visitors and you realize he's very depressed (dishes unwashed, dust everywhere). And when he pursues his project to a meeting with obviously dangerous, cruel \\"scientists\\" at the Cerberus society it's clear that Paul is losing it-- but that also means he's close to his breakthrough. <br /> <br />I didn't think the twists and turns were at all unusual given the situation-- maybe the Cerberus society, but grief-stricken peoplehave always consulted psychics and mediums and Paul's doing so seemed almost expected. <br /> <br />I'm holding back one star only because I didn't think the revelations at the end were as convincing for me as they were for the lead character so I felt a little let-down.  But overall, this is a must-read for anyone who loves animals and has ever experienced grief-- or for anyone who likes great writing.	2004-08-31

I gave this four stars because I did read it in one session, despite my being exhausted-- Lowry sure knows how to pace a story and set up a world.  Some thoughts: <br /> <br />1)  It does help to have read the Giver and Gathering Blue.  If you have, some of the offhand references have a lot more power.  It's wonderful to meet up with Jonas (here called Leader) and Kira again, and see that their worlds coexisted.  It's also increasingly clear that this is definitely our own world in the future, for not only do they share some place names (in Gathering Blue) but there are references to Moby Dick and to Shakespeare.  So it's not \\"like\\" Earth, it is Earth. <br /> <br />2)  A society defined by how inclusive it is of outsiders is a great idea!  so it was nice to make that a defining issue, since if you've read The Giver, you know firsthand how it is that people have a place to go. <br /> <br />3)  But there are a lot of loopholes.  If it is our world, how did it become so full of magic?  The forest has a spirit all its own.  This is an issue in the previous two books but it seems larger here.  And: <br /> <br />a.  who is the mysterious Trade Master?  What's in this for him?  Why is Trade bad, but market day not... do they have a currency they were using? <br /> <br />b.  what has happened to the old society of Jonas'-- we know he got books... but I wanted to know more.  it seems odd that he thinks about his sister, but not his brother.  Unless his brother is referred to somewhere in the book by a True Name and I just missed it-- where the heck is Gabe? <br /> <br />These questions leave you wanting yet one more sequel!  and that's all right with me, because I'm a fan of Lowry's-- may she go on writing these!   <br /> <br />Raises some interesting philosophical questions, like the previous two, so I imagine it would be a good one to read with kids (I'm an adult).	2004-08-23

This is a fast read, and it reads like a memoir-humor book-- don't be fooled.  It's full of REAL information, and good advice. <br /> <br />I have only a limited experience in this world, a few month's as a producer's assistant, but everything they described is 100% accurate.  As I investigate how I want to continue, I'm finding the descriptions of the different roles invaluable (particularly that of assistant to a network exec as a great job for those in the witness protection program; i.e. you'll never meet anyone... lol) <br /> <br />the way these two got into the industry is, as is the norm, highly idiosyncratic, full of luck, timing and chutzpah.  It's no surprise that both have done well along the way. <br /> <br />This is also a useful book for creative artists-- screenwriters, actors, aspiritng directors-- because it gives an invaluable inside look at the day-to-day life of the offices and staff of the people they need to deal with.   <br /> <br />Better than I hoped it would be! <br />	2004-08-22

I'm not a working mother, not a mother at all, but I was able to relate socompletely to Kate.  I'm not in finance either but for once it seemed sort of interesting-- Kate is a hedge fund manager and she has to travel around the world and take phone calls in the middle of the night.  Unlike some other chick lit books (notable the shopaholic books), this heroine is convincingly good at a glamorous-but-demanding job. <br /> <br />But really it's the writing that makes this book.  The plot is not all that original-- there's a good-looking man who is tempting her away from her husband; she is torn between her home and her work-- but Kate is such an appealing heroine and the writing is so vivid that the book speeds along.  I owned this book for awhile before I started it but once I began I couldn't put it down.  It was really a treat. <br /> <br />One of my favorite moments is when her daughter draws a picture of her...she asks her daughter if Mummy is wearing a hat, daughter replies, no it's Mummy's hair, brown on top and yellow on the bottom!  (oops... really need to stop putting off getting those highlights done!) <br /> <br />Despite the jokes and the light-heartedness there are very real things at stake for the character and you share her journey as she struggles to make the right choice.  Whether or not you're married with kids, everyone struggles to find that balance between work and family--to find the proper balance in life. <br /> <br />Overall, really satisfying read!	2004-08-22

But in my view it's the best execution of a story about a literary wife-- and isn't it the execution that matters?  This book is a joy to read; the prose is elegant and economic.  Yes it is a portrait of the changing times, but there is a central \\"story question\\"-- what is the final thing prompting Joan to divorce her famous husband, Joe Castleman, after a lifetime of marriage?  Is it just bitterness that she never pursued her own talent, anger over his cheating and taking her for granted, self-actualization? <br /> <br />There is a twist in the book-- I didn't see it coming at all, but when it did, like the movie Sixth Sense, everything else fell into place.  This is a must-read for anyone with literary aspirations or for anyone in a long-term relationship.    I only knew Wolitzer as a comic writer before, and there are some comic scenes, but in this book she equals Gail Godwin and Philip Roth (who had to have been part of the inspiration for charismatic, crude Joe).   This is as palatable as any beach novel but is so much more substantial!	2004-08-19

It's serviceable, and the dialogue is often very good indeed.  Also it gets better as it goes along, so by the middle of the book you might find yourself not wanting to put it down. <br /> <br />Lizzie is a likeable character-- not a whiner like the heroine of Prada nor an altruist like Nanny in Nanny Diaries; she's a young woman making a career shift from politics to entertainment almost on a whim.  What saves her from being insufferable is that she really is open-minded and trying to make the best of it, and although she has some understandable second thoughts, she ends up realizing that this is a good world for her abilities and interests after all. <br /> <br />But don't just read this for the \\"chick-flick\\" appeal-- this is a MUST READ for anyone who wants to make it in Hollywood.  I worked recently on a high-powered TV show-- not an \\"Agency\\"-- but I can say with certainty that the authors are 100% accurate in their depiction of the commercial entertainment world.  It's treacherous but also naive; deceptive and gullible-- all at the same time.  And there ARE opportunities to be had. <br /> <br />Loved the description of \\"falling upward,\\" the tendency, unique to Hollywood, to reward those who are fired with positions higher up.  The description of the trip to Sundance was hilarious and fascinating.  In the end, Hollywood seems like a sunny place-- you can get burned but you can also just get a nice glow; you have to be careful how you expose yourself. <br /> <br />I found this inspiring and entertaining.  And I'll be going through it with my highlighter for tips.	2004-08-17

For one thing, it's just terrifically written-- not &quot;terrifically written for a Hollywood hack,&quot; but &quot;terrifically written,&quot; period.  Eszterhas' style is succinct, surprising and vivid.  Some think he's boasting that he admires Salinger, Faulkner and Hemingway-- but Eszterhas writes terrific prose.  He seems to be speaking directly, but his details are surprising and vivid.  I haven't read his journalism, but I bet his articles were great.  <br />He alternates chapters about Hollywood (which are yes, fascinating and appalling) with chapters called &quot;flashback&quot; about his dirt-poor and often difficult childhood as  Hungarian immigrant in Cleveland, and brief, italicized sections called &quot;close-ups&quot; that are portraits of unnamed Hollywood personalities (a poolcleaner, a vice president, an actress).<br />It's a long book, but because of the way it's structured, it's a quick read (well, it took me a few weeks to get through it, but each time I'd pick it up I'd read 60-70 pages before I could bear to put it down).  Ezsterhas includes verbatim hatchet-letters he's written to agents and producers who've offended him-- including one hilarious letter to Mike Ovitz that sets off a feud that is a running theme throughout the book.  And while Ezsterhas is articulate and hilarious, any reader-- including apparently Ezsterhas himself-- can see that he's also defensive, arrogant and difficult as hell.<br />You can't help liking him anyway.<br />Even as he recounts episodes of cheating on his first wife.  Even as he recounts painful alienations from friends and family that he is at least partially responsible for.  Even when he shows a less than forgiving heart not only to his father but, in one of the sections that shows him in a rather petty light, to old high school classmates (he carries a grudge after 20 years and seems to take some glee in it).<br />In part that's because Joe is onto himself.  He's deeply critical of himself and the book is long and full enough to show him actually reversing earlier actions that might raise an eyebrow.  His portraits are sometimes cruel, but he doesn't spare himself either-- and there's as much love as contempt.  Well, nearly.  You get the sense that even when he was most a &quot;hollywood animal&quot;-- the guy was FUN.  With a kind of fairness and honesty that is rare, threatening and delightful.<br />In the end, the book praises &quot;flyover&quot; values (the states in between the coasts)--prayer, family, changing seasons, hard work.  Joe moves to Ohio with his family, and stays.<br />I found it inspiring on a lot of levels.  Yes, I'm in entertainment and picked up the book for the &quot;hollywood gossip&quot;-- and there's lots of it here.  One of the most admirable qualities Joe has is his sheer output.  He doesn't write a whole lot about his process (though there is one section detailing his work on one of the screenplays).  But many times throughout the book he writes of pitching this or that spec-- here is a man who didn't wait for assignments to just get to work.  <br />But the book is inspiring too as an American Dream/Nightmare story, complete with pitfalls and rewards.  finally Joe battles with cancer-- and goes on to become an anti-smoking activist.  Go, Joe!<br />I rarely want to read a memoir more than once.  But this one is so rich and full I know I'll be referring to it often.  A great treat, easy going down but good for you too.  Bravo!	2004-06-27

I disagree with a lot of Breitbart and Ebner's views but surprisingly-- because i'm argumentative!-- didn't become hot under the collar when apropos of nothing they'd slam a show I like (for example, they called \\"Sex and the City\\" the lowpoint of HBO's Sunday night without ever backing it up)-- because it was so clearly just these guys' opinions.<br />Some of this is mean and empty, but lots of it is the fruit of real research and some investigative work, too.  I work in entertainment and have seen my share of actors' mouthing off about politics-- but hey, who wouldn't grab a forum if one is offered, and nobody points out \\"you don't know what you're talking about?\\"<br />The chapter on Hollywood and religion was really fine, with attention to the weird Kabbalah fad that's nearly a cult (and bears little relation to the traditional Jewish mysticism that requires immersion in Orthodoxy first) and to Scientology.<br />Lighten up and take the book on entertainment value (I got a kick out of the way they always referred to \\"the heterosexual Tom Cruise\\" for example) and this is a fun read.  Not to be taken too seriously and not to be tried at home...enlightening and infuriating.  Don't expect too much info on the real workings of Hollywood-- this is a condemnation of the lifestyle, not of the business per se.<br />If you occasionally enjoy listening to Limbaugh or Carlson articulately mouth off, you can enjoy this too... I did!	2004-06-11

Her experiences take on a universal quality--I'm not a fifty-something Irish writer whose parents were miserable together (one cold, the other alcoholic) when not being charming.  Yet in her descriptions of fear, loneliness, hope I find myself feeling singing &quot;she's killing me softly with her song.&quot;<br />This is no feel-good &quot;How I overcame bad times&quot; memoir in which the heroine is homeless/battered/deathly ill but survives &quot;with a little help from my friends.&quot;  Nuala recounts successes, mistakes, bad judgement, anger, joy without ever portraying herself as a victim.  And the result is that her story lands in your gut.<br />Few writers would admit worrying about the cat being lonely if she went out for an evening-- they'd be too self-conscious and worry about looking pathetic.  Not Nuala.  The result is that she wins us over utterly. <br />This book opens with a great deal more joy than her other books (the wonderful memoir Are You Somebody? and the novel  My Dream of You).  She recounts with wonder the unexpected success of her memoir and the opportunities it brought her-- the waves of approval from TV talk-show audiences, the trip to New York where she met Frank McCourt, the money.  But it didn't ultimately protect her heart from a painful end to a long-standing lesbian relationship, a one-sided affair with a married man, and a troubled relationship with a man she met on line, whose little girl Nuala had to struggle not to resent.<br />I heard O'Faolain read at Colliseum books New York, and she recounted how in Dublin, everyone criticized her for having had an affair with a married man (who, to be fair, did not ever tell her he was married until very very late in the game) while in America, people were shocked at her attitude to the child.  Yet in both, O'Faolain is nothing more than honest.  Who hasn't felt jealous and wished they didn't?  O'Faolain is never malicious, vindictive or cruel.<br />She writes with candor about being down-and-out inside, though material circumstances look well.  She's an inspiration in every way-- she gives the reader permission to empathize, to say, &quot;yes, it's like that, and she survived, and I can too&quot;.  You don't have to have a terrible illness or crushing poverty to have legitimate feelings of despair, and O'Faolain is proof that they can be overcome-- with grace.<br />And her prose is terrific.  Simple without being simplistic, somehow she turns a riff on 9/11 to a consideration of voting in Africa.  <BR>She's a real writer, and one for the ages-- her main focus is on herself, but her gaze takes on all humanity.	2004-06-10

The premise of this book-- a high school girl begins to suspect her best friend of psychological problems after finding a defaced photograph, and then the friend is accused of somehow causing the death of three infants-- drew me in.  I expected it to work itself out to be a treatise on how dangerous repressed emotions are, or possibly even schizophrenia.<br />but this book does not condescend to its teenage readers that way.  Lauren refuses to believe in Janaan's guilt and as events play out they become more difficult to explain away-- especially when the coffins turn out empty.<br />The two girls end up doing some detective work of their own and uncover the surprising truth.  This is somewhere between Judy Blume and Nancy Drew and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would-- I was prepared to find a predictable conclusion enjoyable enough but this was so much better.  Highly recommended and an unexpected treat!	2004-06-08
US	51973726	R1DXAZ2V1KMALE	074323751X	817983026	The Fugitive Queen (Ursula Blanchard Mystery at Queen Elizabeth I's Court)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Historical narrative which happens to have a mystery!	I have read and enjoyed some historical fiction in this period, particularly the Chronicles of Lymond by Dorothy Dunnett, but generally am skeptical of mysteries.  So often mystery writers spend a lot of energy deliberately misleading the reader and the payoff (&quot;Oh, it was a red herring&quot;) leads to frustration at time wasted.<br />Not in this case.  I picked up this book without realizing it was one in a series and enjoyed it so much I went back and read the first novel (and will be making my way through the rest).  The way this book is written, it seems more like a historical novel whose main character is reluctantly involved in a mystery, than a book in which the mystery is the point.<br />Ursula Blanchard is an engaging, strong, sympathetic woman, and her point of view is sensible and shrewd.  All of the minor characters are fully drawn-- including poor man-crazy, plain Penelope who keeps getting into trouble through her romantic nature.  I knew this book was going to be good when Penelope's embarassing crush on the music teacher was never explained away-- it really WAS a poor teenage crush (so often something like this would be used as a red herring in which the music teacher was involved in a plot too etc. etc.)<br />Great sense of menace once Ursula gets to the countryside, but nobody is a cardboard villain.<br />I read this after having completed a disappointing collection of mystery short stories called &quot;Much Ado about Murder,&quot; so Buckley's winning me over is even more impressive as I was skeptical that merely setting something in a historical period could make the story interesting... and of course, it isn't the merely the period that's interesting.<br />Buckley is a terrific storyteller and Ursual is a wonderful narrator.  Really enjoyable in every respect!	2004-06-06

My Adored Older Brother recommended this book to me (shoved it in my hands in fact and made me take it) so I read it... but other than the fact that it demonstrates that many, many people make career shifts and life shifts and geographical shifts in their thirties and forties I'm not sure how it is helpful.<br />This is NOT a book like Barbara Sher's &quot;Wishcraft.&quot;  There are no guidelines for determining your goals and going after them-- this isn't even really a self-help book.<br />What it is, is a collection of essays based on interviews with an assortment of different people wrestling with this question.  Many, if not most, of the people are still in flux, or even actively dissatisfied, when Bronson finishes the essay on them.  Though this is realistic it's also depressing.  <br />And there's far too much commentary from Bronson about his own journey (pardon me but I just don't have all that much sympathy for his struggles since he made a fortune as a young man before he found his path to creative writing... and to his true love... he certainly seems to have it all now, and his periods of angst seem largely self-induced) and how he came to choose the people he wrote about. <br />Some of the essays began with paragraphs about how this or that person almost didn't make it into the book, even though he or she kept emailing him-- which led to the notion that being included was an honor.  Well, in a way I suppose it was, but it has the effect of calling attention to the process of the book's writing more than to its content.<br />Ultimately for me not enough stories were inspirational and not enough were memorable. <br />BUT.  I'm in the arts, and the notion of making a career or life change is not in and of itself a hard concept for me (just the mechanism of it itself).<br />For people who have not really undertaken to figure this out-- and I think that includes a lot of people who have gone straight into lucrative fields (OK, I guess I do understand why Bronson uses himself as an example of how making money can be unfulfilling)-- this is an important question.  One thing that did resonate is how some of his interviewees would misstate the title of the book-- the SHOULD is important.  It's not &quot;what do I really want&quot; but &quot;what SHOULD I do with my life.&quot;  This is an interesting angle...<br />and on the whole it's an interesting read when you first think about the question.<br />But for real motivation and encouragement, I'd go with any of Barbara Sher's books!	2004-06-06

But The Little Leftover Witch is really just as wonderful, funny, vivid and haunting as I thought at the time.<br />This was my FAVORITE book when I was seven, and took it just as a literal fairytale about what would happen if a little witch girl got left on a tree outside a human family's window on Halloween.  At the time I much preferred mischievous Felina to sweet Lucinda.  It's surprisng to read it again at this distance and see just how perfectly Laughlin captured the behavior of small girls without either fudging on their maturity or condescending to them!  <br />I also found myself entirely in love with the world of the Doons.  In fact, I reread the book as soon as I finished.  This family is nice-- and yet, still believable.  Mrs. Doon loses her temper (well, only after severe provocation when Felina brings the cat to the supermarket!)... and there are family traditions and little bits of individuality everywhere.<br />What I missed, reading this as a child, was the metaphor for adoption-- and the metaphor of how love can truly change a person.  In the world of the Doon's, Felina's witchiness is a fact-- not a delusion-- and everyone in the town buys into it.  But in the hands of the adult reader, Felina's witchiness is every lonely child's feeling of not belonging.  No wonder all kinds of children love this book!  It has everything-- terrific writing (brief enough for early-ish readers), memorable characters, humor, adventure-- and a terrific depiction of the power of love.	2004-06-04

I downloaded this onto my ipod for a long journey (there wasn't a category for that on Amazon, but presumably it's the same basic version as the audiotape, since Gaiman read it...)<br />I'd only read one other Neil Gaiman book, which i enjoyed enough to check this out.  Wow!  He's an amazing reader fo his own work... his gentle British accent throws the sheer spookiness of the altered everyday world into high relief.  And made some of Coraline's speeches very funny, as when having been saved from an awful fate by the mysterious cat she replies with mere politeness, though out of breath and terribly relieved.<br />The rats dancing under the bed about how they will be here when you fall (\\"you\\" meaning humanity i think) were sung in speeded up, distorted little voices that were... haunting... to say the least!  It's rare that after listening to an audiobook i feel like reading the book too but i did.. haven't gotten around to it yet but i will.<br />Gaiman's knowledge of mythology and monsters is wide-ranging, to say the least... (the other book I read was American Gods) so i don't know if \\"she,\\" the Other Mother next door, is based on a real malevolent spirit.  but it certainly felt as if she did.<br />This is a great thriller/horror story in which all of the characters and scenes are vivid and clear, not just the baddies but Coraline's family-- her distracted father and ordinary, loving mother-- the neighbors in the apartment building, including an eccentric old man training mice for a circus (who turns out to be a lot less crazy than Coraline thinks), the old ladies who used to be on the stage.  And their doubles are hilarious-- at first benignly and then... not.<br />Coraline's portrayal is marvelous too. She's plucky and bright-- much brighter than one might think-- that is to say, the narrative is matter-of-fact and though it's Coraline's pov, we don't realize just HOW bright she is until she puts her plans into action.  Gaiman wastes no time on introspection orrevealing her plans ahead of time-- which is a great strategy.  Coraline is rather classic \\"still waters run shrewd.\\"<br />Original, complete and highly recommended!	2004-03-25
US	51973726	R3C4KWH99UO6SV	0142000221	256403279	Cause Celeb	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Bridget Jones gets serious--Kingsolveresque	OK, it's perhaps not quite fair to describe this book in terms of Bridget Jones, since Fielding wrote it several years before Bridget Jones' Diary.  But it's probably a safe bet that anybody reading it has already read Bridget Jones or seen the movie... and I would argue that in every respect-- form, elegance, sureness of itself-- Bridget Jones is a better book.  The writing is that much more mature.<br />But, the two books are really in completely different genres.  Where Bridget Jones' Diary practically defined a whole new chick-lit, the literary equivalent of Sex and the City (the columns by Candace Bushnell of that name are halfway between journalism and fiction, so I'd say Fielding really broke the ground that would soon be followed by Confessions of a Shopaholic, etc), Cause Celeb is closer to a kind of female coming-of-age Holden Caulfield lite than it is to comedy of manners.<br />True, many of the chapters do send up the culture of celebrity, and they are well handled.  But Rosie Richardson's transformation from Bridget-like young-woman-in-publishing-involved-with-selfish-man to a relief worker is real, and very serious.  Not only does she leave for Africa with no regrets, she becomes a very competent head of the program, and stays for four years.<br />MOST of the book takes place in the fictional country of Nambula, hovering on the edge of a famine and crisis.  Fielding's attention to detail is wonderful, and she clearly knows what she writes about.  It reminded me a lot of Barbara Kingsolver and her young heroines in Africa in Poisonwood Bible.  When we finally get to the plot to have Rosie's old pals come and do a benefit the book becomes more interesting, but never really soars into the broad, hilarious satire it's described as being.  This is Evelyn Waugh territory, but sentimental where Waugh is cutting, sad where Waugh would be cynical... so that it hovers uncertainly between Kingsolver-like punch and later-Fielding like panache.  <br />For me, the more interesting chapters were the flashbacks to London, and the horrible people Fielding gleefully lances.  And this was most effectively handled before Rosie grew a conscience and suddenly fell out of love with her newscaster boyfriend and with the shallow life.  That is where Rosie's character is most vivid, and where Fielding's writing really shines.  When she goes back to London to round up the celebrities, the cynical portratis are funny-- but teeter on self-righteoous. It's easier to like Rosie when she doesn't tell us what to think of the celebrities or of herself. There are some great characters in Africa too, but the love interest there is underplayed.<br />Reading this has me more impressed with Fielding's range than I was, but very grateful she turned to the wonderful comedy she now writes.  There, she's a unique, precious talent.   Still, worth a read if you're interested in the life of a relief worker and in Africa!	2003-12-28
US	51973726	RKQGPHPNT5QDC	0312291639	244886090	The Nanny Diaries: A Novel	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Money Can't Buy Me Love	On the surface, this book is in the same genre as Confessions of a Shopaholic or The Devil Wears Prada-- it's a young woman working around money who has none of her own, in an awful job.<br />But that's just the surface.  A few things distinguish this book and make its popularity well-earned.  One is that it's very well written!  The shape of the sentences, the pacing, the observation and the way characters are revealed through dialogue and action (&quot;show, don't tell&quot;)-- are very well-handled.   And yes in a few places it's terribly funny.  The Halloween episode, in which Nanny (her name as well as her job) has to take her small charge to a company party, in a chapter called &quot;Night of the Banking Dead,&quot; did make me laugh out loud at the descriptions of how in her big round teletubby costume she had to be pushed by doormen into and out of cabs.<br />The other thing that distinguishes this book is that at its center there is something very serious, and that is childcare and neglect.  Grayer-- nicknamed &quot;Grover&quot; by Nanny, since he had no nicknames before-- is a lively, occasionally difficult, basically sweet and essentially unhappy four-year old.  His wealthy parents view him more as an accessory than as a small human being, and when he does form an attachment to a nanny that's just around the time that his mother fires her because, as in the case of Caitlin, Nanny's predecessor, she had the nerve to ask for a week's vacation.<br />Occasionally it's hard to understand why Nanny, an NYU senior with a fine mind, lovely family (who clearly have some money, too) and independent spirit submits to the slave labor that quickly becomes her job.  Very early on Mrs. X asks her to buy things for a dinner party and at that point she's not so attached to Grayer so one wonders why she doesn't just say &quot;I'd love to help you but I can't.&quot;  But this is a bit of a mystery for Nanny too, and certainly to her family to whom she gripes.  She does needthe money-- although the Xes pay late and sometimes underpay-- and what she realizes is that she's becoming the prime caregiver for Grayer, who loves her and counts on her.  Nanny is serious about childcare and she can't easily walk away.<br />Many of the wealthy people portrayed in the book are unbelievably shallow and unloving, but there are one or two exceptions.  One family surprises Mrs. X. when she asks &quot;where will the children eat?&quot; at a barbecue by answering &quot;With us, of course.&quot;  It should be noted though that that family lives not in Manhattan but in the suburbs of Westchester.<br />Nanny is a wonderful character-- smart, empathetic, appealing.  It's easy to understand how she allowed herself to be exploited.  She gets caught in the middle of an affair Mr. X is having with one of his managers at the firm-- and she pities Mrs. X.  And when she realizes Mrs. X. is the second wife, who got her husband after an affair, Nanny knows that Mrs. X. knows just how fragile her life has become.  Not to say that Mrs. X. would be a great mother if she were happier, but she'd be a better person.<br />Not that the Xes have any similar regard for the reality of Nanny's life... in any case, I found episodes and events from this book coming back to me.  For all that it's a delightful quick read, it's haunting and very memorable.  And yes, it's sad... almost a cautionary tale.  But it rings true.  These women (Kraus and McLaughlin) clearly know small children, the wealthy upper east-side society lady, and childcare, and it shows.  A great read which deserves all its popularity!	2003-12-09

The prose was leaden!  Whoever told this woman she could write?  Although it's obviously thinly-veiled autobiography and the narrator wants to be a writer, this book was full of such scintillating sentences as &quot;You're scared of me,&quot; he stated factually, flashing me a teasing smile.  More Danielle Steele than Helen Fielding.<br /> But worse than that, there's almost no forward motion to this story.  Once it's been established that she hates fashion and despises her shallow editor, what are we waiting for?   I felt ahead of the story, uninterested in the main character and almost sympathetic to the boss from Hell.  No particular character growth,  no surprises, no startling sentences and no laughs.  Yes, it sounded like a grueling job, but her reasons for staying were never convincing... <br />other characters in the book are just as shallowly portrayed.  She has a flirtation that leads nowhere, an impossibly saintly boyfriend, and a troubled roommate, all of whom seem to be right out of central casting from a Judith Krantz tv movie.<br />I loved Bridget Jones and I read magazines and  should have loved a story about a young Jewish girl who wants to write who falls into this job, but her attitude and self-involvement was a turn off.  It took me a whole week to finish this and I wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't been asked to read it as a reader's corner reader for Elle.  A trip to Paris began to make the book more interesting-- but then it, and the book, abruptly ended.<br />Read THE NANNY DIARIES, HIGH MAINTENANCE or THE LOVELY BONES instead!	2003-12-07

I was a little shocked-- but then so was the author-- when he had his first sexual encounter at age 13.  He didn't seem to enjoy it much, and although he began a relationship with the man (34!), he clearly had mixed feelings the whole time...  but the main thing, as Augusten himself later realizes, is that, without an adult to tell you what NOT to do... \\"freedom\\" is just like being trapped.  It's the real meaning of \\"freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.\\"  After his mother pawns him off on her nutty egomaniac psychologist and his squalid though entertaining household and his father refuses to accept charges on collect calls, Augusten is a free agent... at 12.<br />This is a great read, though.  Augusten is preternaturally self-aware, even as a tiny child... he's sort of a flaming queen at eight, with his fetishes about clothes and cleanliness, and his identification with his \\"poet\\" mother (we get one excerpt from her poetry and it's god-awful, self-indulgent junk, though she has delusions of New Yorker publication)... and his observations are mixed with just the right amount of analysis so that we get to make our own conclusions without losing sight of his opinions and attitudes.<br />Great sense of place and time-- this could ONLY be the seventies in Northhampton.  Somehow he and the kids in the squalid \\"Doc's\\" household maintain some humanity even without any limits or restraints and though much of what goes on qualifies as \\"abuse\\" (it's a miracle social workers never broke up the family) there's no intentional cruelty... and we just know that Augusten's talent will pull him through.  <br />This is a hard book to put down; its structure is short, independent chapters with titles like \\"Something Isn't Right.\\"  They connect to one another only loosely after awhile-- the beginning tells a pretty clear story of the parents' divorce and Augusten's transfer to the loopy Finch family.  The middle sometimes seems unrelated episodes and occasionally I wanted to know more about the details (after he and his foster sister Natalie sing \\"You Light Up My Life\\" in a mental home and a patient spits at them, do they ever go back?).  But that also makes the story at times a little frustrating.<br />Still, what a talent!  and with almost no formal education or guidance.  I look forward to reading Dry, the sequel, in which young Augusten manages to get hired as an advertising copyrighter in New York.  This book was an unexpected pleasure, neither gross-out, maudlin, \\"uplifiting\\" or \\"redemptive\\" but funny, sad and truthful.	2003-12-06

When I picked up this book I didn't realize that it was a thinly fictionalized autobiographical novel, but I'm not surprised... as in many autobiographical fictions, central character explorations are missing.  The main one here is the author's assumption that the narrator, Nancy, is a normal girl from the suburbs who happened to have becoming a prostitute as her life's ambition.  The book presents this matter-of-factly... first she wanted to be a librarian, then a centerfold, then a prostitute.  The first two are normal enough, but the third...?<br />Though it is fascinating to read about the details of Nancy's work-life (much of the work is faked, as it would be in exotic dance), the book assumes that being a call-girl is a cushy job.  The normalcy of the \\"nice girls\\" who enter into it is taken for granted... consider Allison, who has a BA in Art History.  Nancy views her leaving a job as a shop assistant to become a call girl as a step up, and Allison seems to view it the same way.  Who ARE these people?<br />The other thing the book never recovers from is the glossed-over revelation that Nancy ran away at age 14.  So apparently she's a high-school drop out who's been a hooker for over ten years... successfully faking out her boyfriend that she's a copy editor, successfully faking out her family.  Is everyone in her universe that stupid?  <br />So for most readers-- likely to be college-educated magazine-reading Sex-and-the-City watching single women-- the central character is both recognizable (where she shops, details of her day) and completely alien.I (a college-educated etc. etc.) found it impossible to relate to-- or worse, even believe in-- Nancy's decision over whether to keep hooking or marry her unbelievably sweet and loyal boyfriend.  How did she meet Matt?  What does he see in her?<br />At best, Nancy is a woman whose self-esteem depends entirely on admiration from men, which she gets via prostitution (which doesn't always even include the sex act).  She's functional, but who is she?  Even she doesn't really know, she leads so many different lives.  And since the main energy of her life goes into herself-- we never see her expressing a selfless emotion for anyone-- it's hard to view her as anything but a shallow narcissist, let alone pity her.<br />The blurbs on the book present it as funny, but really it's sad, though it thinks it's smart.  Two stars for sheer fascination.	2003-12-04

A book about a woman finding an apartment and looking for love in NY seemed to fit the bill.  Well-- this book both did and didn't fulfill my expectations.  It is a quick, engrossing read, but it's much more subtle and surprising than a light comic novel usually is.  I can understand why some people haven't enjoyed it-- the book keeps the reader at a bit of distance.<br />The narrator, Liv Kellerman, is not a wise-cracking, Candace Bushnell/Helen Fielding type of heroine... she holds back some of what she knows and feels, so that the reader doesn't learn until very late in the book what prompted the divorce, for example.  Liv married very young, and is the daughter of a famous designer, and has no education to speak of-- but a natural intelligence that reveals itself more through the mordant, surprising things she says, than through the decisions she makes.<br />I couldn't put the book down, and a lot of it is really funny (her first real estate boss, Dale, is a &quot;manwoman&quot; as repulsive and pitiful as any to be found in literature) and also compelling-- her relationship to Andrew is by turns erotic and sad.  Again, though, we learn so much about Liv not from what she tells us, but what we hear her saying-- how she teases Andrew, who hasn't yet left his live-in girlfriend, about what it will be like when they are married and she will have parades of private detectives following him everywhere...<br />The ending is a bit of a let-down, and I did keep hoping more information would be revealed-- &quot;the facts, ma'am&quot;-- than we ever got.  But the writing is sharp, even edgy, and even though I didn't always understand the heroine or what was driving her, I was rooting for her and wanted to know what would happen.  Belle is an interesting writer.  The marketing is a little misleading-- the novel may have funny episodes, but Belle is a serious writer.	2003-09-22

The genes = temperament thing is a little simplistic.<br />Rutherford does know how to draw compelling characters and tell good stories.  The trouble is that no story is ever resolved... We spend a good chapter in a particular time period, invest in that character... say, the nobleman Godfrey who tries and fails to arrange marriages for his children with moneyed merchants (the Wilsons, descended from that nasty old Tep)... and start to care...<br />and then suddenly, it's 50 or 75 years later.<br />For me, that sometimes meant that reading was a bit of a chore.  I did enjoy many of the vignettes, particulary during Elizabeth's reign, and the restoration.<br />The Victorian and modern periods were far less convincing... and the book just stops in 1985.  Like the individual chapters, it doesn't really resolve.<br />I tended to be far less interested in the authorial history lessons that are inserted from time to time.<br />It's a worthwhile read... I'd recommend highly for anyone about to travel to that part of the world.  Much less dry than a &quot;straight&quot; history of the place would be...<br />..but for me, not a really engrossing historical tale... too fragmented.	2003-08-29

Don't be put off by the poetic cover and alternate world setting-- this book is very straightforward and immediately engrossing.  I began reading it at a highway reststop on a long drive and ended up staying until I finished it!<br />With elements of a great school story (like Harry Potter!), \\"Fame\\"-- competition and talent among young people, and coming-of-age-- young Cerinthe feels responsible for her mother's death so avoids using her intuition as a healer-- this book is rich in detail and strong in character.  The atmosphere of Faranor, the capital of the country, and the sea religion-- the Sea Maid is the goddess, and those who are gifted like Cerinthe hear her singing in a very literal way-- add to the power of the story and its themes.  The dance is clearly ballet, and uses the same terms as ballet in our world, but dancers are called \\"daina\\" and \\"daine\\" rather than ballerina.  Any child (or any person) with a calling, and maybe a choice between two callings, will find this story close to their heart.  What do we sacrifice when we dedicate ourselves to a skill?  Is it worth it?  Sometimes the answer is very complicated!<br />A must-read for any girl or woman with an interest in dance, or in the arts.  Cerinthe's growing maturity, and her beginning to understand the humanity of even her opponents, is very touching.  Surprising and delightful book!	2003-08-05

Yes, the heroine has a tragic past (father killed herself).  Yes, she is taking a course on supernatural fiction... and ultimately has a dangerous flirtation with her teacher.  yes, the new girl steals her best friend's affections.<br />These are all red herrings-- and the reason nobody takes her seriously.  It's like the old saying, &quot;Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.&quot;  <br />This is a chilling book... and I can't imagine that the blonde best friend wasting away is named &quot;Lucy&quot; (did none of the reviewers even READ Dracula or Carmilla?) by accident.  Real deaths happen, mysterious illnesses and other elusive things that have only one of two explanations:  a &quot;real&quot; gothic vampire, or a psychotic narrator.<br />To me the story only makes sense with the former... and that the narrator herself, as a grown woman, decides it must have been the latter is part of the novel's tragedy.<br />This is a witty, sly, haunting modern version of Carmilla.  Chilling and very sad... perhaps the saddest is how we blind ourselves to real danger and evil in the name of &quot;normal.&quot;	2003-08-05

Best known as a playwright, this is not a play trying to be a novel-- there is dialogue, yes, but also lots of description and atmosphere.  I applaud him for knowing which medium this story demanded, and for his versatility and skills.   <br />The six immortal words that change Stephen's life are his best friend Keith's &quot;My mother is a German spy.&quot;<br />Of course, any adult reader doubts that right away, but Keith is so odd and  creepy that as he and Stephen (the narrator) set to trailing his mother there is an awful sense of tension and looming tragedy.<br />It's impossible not to think of L.P. Hartley's The Go-Between, if you've read it-- in that book likewise a man remembers being a child engaging in a mystery that was not what it seems.  That book really does amount to heartbreak and inevitable tragedy.  Partly that's because the adult reader understands what is going on better than the narrator.<br />In Frayn's novel, the older narrator has barely more insight than he did as a child-- and there's an irritating sense that things are being deliberately held back from the reader.  The revelations, when we finally get to them, are not satisfying enough for me.<br />As a portrait of tension, suspicion and wartime paranoia, along with the awkwardness of adolescent friendships and loyalties, Frayn succeeds.  But as a mystery, it's frustrating...the tension is both too much and not enough.  The reader knows that whatever theory the boys come up with is wrong, and it takes too long to see that there is a mystery at all... so it never grabbed me with its urgency.<br />If you read it for the mood and not for the story, it is well written and worthwhile... for me it never really gelled.	2003-07-26

Based on a Katherine Mansfield short story, this story has none of the haunting, ineffable mystery and grandeur of Mansfield's prose, and it fudges its period details.  However, its anachronisms are not too terribly jarring, and the lilting forward motion of the story has some grace.  It veers into melodrama unsuccessfully, and somehow we don't develop the depths of sympathy for the characters that the author wants, but it's a nice read-- if unsubstantial.  Edith Wharton it isn't.  But it's a bit better than a &quot;guilty pleasure,&quot; and goes down smoothly.	2003-07-17

This story is short and clean and unforgettable.<br />The title novella is powerful on so many levels-- told from the pov of a man who realizes his wife has fallen for someone else and is desperate not to let her tell him about it, it is such a convincing portrait of a marriage, of family, of the layers of fear and forgiveness that intimacy brings.  One of the children gets a dangerously high fever and the terror and the bonds of love remind us that infidelity is sometimes part of a relationship, not its definition.<br />The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because while all of the stories are quick reads, well-written-- as is all of Smiley's work-- and occasionally even very funny, not all of them seem as grounded in the poignancy of emotional turning points.  I was rather bored with \\"Dynamite,\\" in which an aging underground movement protester from the sixties decides to reconnect with her family.  That is to say, I didn't really think we needed that bit of plot-- I was far more interested in the family dynamics than the dynamite.<br />\\"Jeffrey, Believe Me\\" is a bit lightweight, doesn't seem to be a part of this volume really, though perhaps it provides some comic relief.  \\"The Pleasure of Her Company\\" though is right up there with \\"Long Distance\\"-- friendship has its own jealousies and betrayals, and no happy couple can ever really be known except by themselves, as the lonely nurse who falls in love with her neighbors discovers.<BR>\\"Lily\\" also lays out the issues of friendship and marriage-- friendship within marriage-- and how marriage is both more and less than romance.<br />Ultimately, read the book just for \\"Long Distance\\" alone.  It's a masterpiece-- and it will haunt me.	2003-06-19

Don't be fooled by the slim length and simple, straightforward telling of this story-- this is a treat for adults as well as for children.  The simplicity of the storytelling reminds me of the Mary Poppins books-- there's more here than meets the eye.<br />I especially love that the story begins by telling us that if we go to school in London we might meet a little girl called Bindi, with an unusual history.  That immediately makes this world of magic \\"real!\\"  <br />Unusually for a children's book, the story begins by having us empathize with Jan, a sad bride and former child actress whose career was cut short by a leg injury, and who wants more than anything else to have a child.  She is out in the garden weeping over her loneliness when she is startled by Tiki, a fairy who has been \\"earthed\\" (i.e., touched a human) when she couldn't follow her friend Wiljic through Jan's toes.  Wiljic is mischievous and knew that Tiki was too fat to get through!<br />Tiki is wearing jeans under her frilly fairy skirt, although it's forbidden by the fairy queen-- \\"we love her\\"-- Tiki says loudly-- and fascinated by Jan's loneliness and tears.  The lovely insouciance of all of the fairies-- when we eventually meet Wiljic it's too discover he longs for savory foods like boiled egg and is sick of nectar and nasturtium-- is just one of the many details that lend reality to this story.  We also know right away that there is trouble in fairyland if the queen makes her subjects so nervous.<br />Tiki arranges for Jan to have a fairy baby (start a pregancy with a little help) and gets herself and Wiljic in trouble.  Meanwhile, Bindi is a nearly perfect human child, with just a small tuft of blue hair... but the fairy queen has not forgotten the disobediance that led to her birth!<br />This story has all the elements of classic fairy tales but is set in a recognizable modern world.  Characters are drawn quickly but have enormous personality-- in the chapter where Bindi wears a wasp necklacesent by the fairy queen which influences her to misbehave, we quickly get a feeling for her school companions, too.  That kind of clear, sharp writing reminds me a bit of Lewis and the Narnian chronicles.<br />My only complaint about this book is that it isn't longer-- although it's just the length it needs to be!<br />A must-read for anyone needing a smile and a flash of delight.	2003-06-17

Nearly overnight-- people contract the disease and die within the hour-- Mattie's life goes from being a slightly overworked teenage daughter of a proprietor of a successful coffee house, to a young woman struggling to survive in a city that's taken on the bleakness of a Mad Max film.<br />Yet somehow we never come as close to Mattie as we might, or as we do with the main character in Anderson's SPEAK.  Mattie's thoughts are so much on survival and on food that at times the book feels a bit like a travelogue of a disaster.  Salvation, when it comes, also seems abrupt.  In the end, this is a quick way to get an immediate feel for a terrible time in history, but although we are told a lot about Mattie, her family, her hopes and dreams, somehow she stays elusive.  Emotionally, the book is a little disappointing, but it's still well worth a read.	2003-06-09

At first the music is slow, melodic but not catchy... as we move through the situation of terrorists kidnapping a whole party of vips assembled in a third-world country, honoring the birthday of a Japanese CEO who's agreed to attend only to hear the famous opera singer the country managed to entice for the night.<br />But stick with this book... it becomes an unforgettable love story, as the terrorists, many of whom are barely more than children, learn to appreciate the beauties of life, and the potential within themselves, and as the vip's release their old lives and find joy and redemption in their new surroundings.  This is a love story-- not just between two particular couples, but a love story for the human race and the possibility of redemption and grace we can find in one another if we only would.<br />Though tragedy waits-- and we are warned of the end very early on, so I am not giving anything away-- we hope against hope that this enchanted interlude could continue, that love will somehow surpass the reality that awaits.  And there is some hope in a surprising epilogue.<br />Music is a transforming agent in the book, as coloratura Roxane Coss' singing tames the savageness in all the assembled \\"terrorists\\" and \\"hostages.\\"  It makes you realize how much we take for granted-- as I type this I listen to beautiful music on my ipod, and expect that I can talk to my loved ones by telephone.  These things are priveleges!  But it's inspiring to see how human identity surpasses the trappings of what keeps us busy.... unforgettable, haunting.	2003-06-05
US	51973726	R373BRCPOBXVMD	014200183X	753464776	Testimony of an Irish Slave Girl	Books	4	60	61	N	N	&quot;testimony&quot;-- not romance; must-read for all minorities	Reading some of the customer reviews I gather that some people were disappointed because this novel is not more dramatic-- even an editorial review remarked on a distant feeling in the narrative.  To be fair I think this is a fault of the book jacket which leads a reader to imagine this will be a 20th-century style romance, a bit more like Roots.<br />No.  this book never lets you to forget it is the 17th-century, and the style of the testimony and even Cot's early memories of Ireland are told in a way that shows harshness and low expectations of life.  Neither the main narrator, the former slave girl (an old crone in her forties at the time of the book's opening) nor her deposer, a young &quot;apothecary&quot; (doctor), come from a world as safe and civilized as ours (for all the fault's in today's world).<br />But look again to the title.  The book is testimony, and it is a testament to a period and an event that few know about-- the impressing of &quot;indentured servants&quot; (i.e., slaves) from Ireland.  &quot;Impressing&quot; is code for &quot;kidnapping.&quot;  The book's heroine, Cot Quashey (nee Daley) is kidnapped at a little over 10 years old, and grows up in this strange new world.  It's a very harsh world, although one does have the impression that it's fairly harsh for masters too.<br />What is remarkable is how quickly most of these slaves adapted to the utter brutality-- forced breeding programs, life in low shacks they built themselves, long labor.  Romance of all kinds is played down-- it is a little disappointing that Cot's beauty is so hinted at without the book ever fulfilling the promise of a steamier romance.  <br />If you come to the book without the expectations of an intimate acquaintance with a sympathetic, fairly modern heroine, you will find a fascinating journey.  The doctor interviews Cot because his employers want to find the connection between the Irish workers and the African slaves, that led to the wave of rebellions on the island.  Even at the end of the story he doesn't see it, but we do.  Cot at first identifies with her captors (like a young Elizabeth Smart) because they are the ones who can save her.  So she betrays one rebellion while still young, something she bitterly regrets at the telling.  But over the course of her life her loyalties shift.<br />She is a creature with many faults-- jealousy, and a certain amount of cowardice.  But she is very human, and a testament to the human will to survive.<br />This is a slim book-- like a deposition, again, not a true novel.  And it is absolutely fascinating.  Cot comes from a  long<BR>line of &quot;seanachies&quot;-- storytellers-- and it shows in her gift for description and honesty.  Hers was a bleak and terrible life, yet she never succumbed to absolute bitterness and despair, finding joy in her children (an interesting point and one that rings true is the deep attachment mothers had to their babies even when they came from a &quot;breeding program&quot;) and taking what pleasures she could in her existence.<br />It's terrible to think people could so abuse each other-- it was an Irish barmaid who contributed to her kidnapping-- with no remorse, but the times were harsh.  That the servants/slaves revolted as often as they did is a testimony to the resilience of human nature even in bondage.  I think this book is a must-read for Jews and Blacks (I read this over Passover) and anyone from any people who have been oppressed (including, perhaps, women!).  Though the ending is ambivalent, if you read between the lines there is enormous hope in her tale.	2003-04-22

From the opening of this book-- Sylvie lived an intresting life, but she didn't get to live it very often-- the wonderful central subject of what characters in a book do when the book is closed is clearly drawn.  I do not think young readers will have any trouble with this concept-- in effect it's no different from wondering what your dolls do when they're not in the room-- and older readers will appreciate the many layers of the book, and the somewhat melancholy depiction of how fast life goes by and how quickly the various Readers age and die, in the \\"real world.\\"  and yet the story is eternal!<br />I enjoyed this book as a fantasy about Sylvie and her longing for adventure-- I enjoyed the details of having to scramble back into page 3, the rules about not looking UP at the reader, the way the \\"stage lights\\" come on when the book is abruptly closed-- the characters who want to behave out of character (the courtly thief, who is far more polite and helpful than he's supposed to be)-- and then, as in the best fantasy, I enjoyed the profound mythic impulse behind it.  Claire, the Reader Sylvie first encountered, is desperately trying to save her grandmother.  She reopens the book to read it to her grandmother, who was once the \\"girl with blue eyes\\" who was the First Reader.  <br />But the exploration of worlds within worlds doesn't stop there.  Claire's grandmother does die, but she reappears in Sylvie's world-- beyond the eastern forest-- as the girl with blue eyes.  It turns out that beyond the margins of the book is the world of Claire's dreams, and many more characters appear there.<br />To reveal more would be to lessen the fun for you Readers out there.  But I will say finally that the book explores what story means to us, how we see our own realities, how we use stories to connect with our families, and even what it means to Create.<br />I expected a fun romp with one little gimmick, I got instead a work of philsophy expressed through humor, dialogue and fairytale-- almost in the tradition of The Little Prince.<br />Not to be missed by any Reader, of any age.	2003-04-03

The stories in this collection are well-written but \\"easy\\"-- a handsome man always turns up in time for a broken-hearted girl (with one notable exception); stories often end with \\"surprises\\" and twists that give a chuckle but do not inspire reflection.  It's like a collection of reprints from a Cosmopolitan magazine, without the soft porn.  No surprises, not much real insight.  Good to read before bed, in other words, but a little disappointing.  <br />Some notable exceptions are Mary Ryan's \\"A good catch,\\" which allows the reader to have a bit more insight into the situation than the painfully naive heroine who didn't realize she was being chatted up by a pimp, and Annie Sparrow's \\"The Unlovable Woman\\" which also has a bittersweet flavor as the heroine fails to recognize love when it literally knocks on her door.  Marian Keye's \\"Soulmates\\" is one of the best in the book, consisting almost entirely of reaction to a frustratingly perfect couple who somehow manage a frustratingly perfect divorce!  <br />Unfotunately many of the others, including Maeve Binchy's \\"Carissima,\\" were very forgettable, and many smacked a lot of wish-fulfillment.  Nothing wrong with that for a light read.  For literature, LADIES' NIGHT... is a much better offering.	2003-03-25

For all that, and despite a promising first chapter where we're introduced to Vivien as she meets David Selznick at the \\"burning of Atlanta\\" and he realizes he's found his Scarlett!-- this is a dull book.<br />but worse than that for anyone really interested in her life, it's a book missing very important facts.  That's not Edwards' fault-- of all the people she acknowledges at the end of the book, Laurence Olivier, Viv's second husband and the man who was there as her manic-depressiveness began to take over, is not listed.  Olivier did not speak much about Vivien until after he'd written his won two volumes of autobiography, in the 80s.  (On Acting and its companion).<br />So, the notorious affair with Peter Finch, for example, is not described, or worse-- described as just a mild flirtation.  Far too much is missing from the biography.  <br />Alexander Walker's book VIVIEN, published after both Olivier and Leigh were dead, is a much better choice, and its style is also far more comprehensive.  Walker spends less time speculating and more time grounding his ideas with citations and sources.  There's also a book coming out in the spring of 2003 which promises to be complete.<br />In short, this must have been a very welcome book in 1977, 10 years after Viv's death, but it's obsolete now.  I gave it two stars because in its time it did represent a great deal of labor and research, and the writing style works hard (unsuccessfully, for me) to keep the reader engaged.  But for anyone who really needs to research her life and the lives of the many famous people in her life, it's missing too much.	2003-03-16

She may be as \\"lovely as the dawn\\" but having gold combed out of her hair is no more than \\"gold dandruff.\\"  The worst part of the gifts the beggarwoman granted her though is that it aroused the attention of a cruel King and a doltish prince who both want to marry her-- and have imprisoned her away from her darling, bratty geese.<br />This book has all the real sweetness of Kindl's OWL IN LOVE-- like Owl, Alexandria is a clever, often frustrated adolescenet with a good heart, a good store of resourcefulness, and an occasional short temper.  Her geese are the same-- they bite and narrow their eyes when they think Alexandria is a little slow on the uptake.<br />This book is a delight through and through.  It's fulled with funny, clever details-- at one point Alexandria notices that an ogress chasing her has the braid in her mole-hair coming undone.<br />Though this is a fairy-tale, it is not at all simpering or sweet-- and only romantic in the very loosest sense of the word.<br />I am an adult reader and appreciate Kindl's humor and imagination and great hand with plot.

I guess it is postmodern, but that term is so offputting to most readers these days that I use it reluctantly.  It's really no more difficult to follow than the postmodern techniques we're all used to with dream-sequences and flashbacks on such shows as &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos.&quot;<br />Second:  the writing is sure of itself, a tour de force.<br />Third:  the subject-- Manila and the Philippines in troubling times-- is, in a sense, the true protagonist.<br />Summary?  It took me a long time to get through this, but that is more a reflection of me than it is a rebuke on the book.  I admired it greatly and was often struck by the insights, the writing, the intimacy with all the people in the society-- from senators and society people to male prostitutes.  Because I have little time to read, I prefer novels to short stories (i.e., a longer story I can pick-up and put-down over the course of a few weeks) and in some respects this was almost more like reading thematically related short stories.<BR>Because of my own limited time to read, I would forget some of the subtle clues connecting the chapters.<br />The book would benefit from a different kind of reading.

(Two of my favorites of his:  SOCKDOLOGY; SCOTLAND ROAD).<br />2)  The book avoids the usual pitfall of playwriting books-- the methodical fallacy.  That is, the fallacy that playwrights work from step a to step b.  So that, once you lay out how a play's arc should work, all a playwright needs to do is plot it out, as if it's a budget on a spreadsheet-- without giving help to how to flesh out a character, how to make a scene interesting.<br />While Hatcher does suggest planning out the plot and writing linearly i (he may be the ONLY professional playwright I know who really does work from an outline; most writers, even the ones who write these how-tos, will confess that they often have a couple of scenes and maybe an ending-- more like a kamikaze mission than a planned road-trip), Hatcher also includes exercises and ideas at the end of every chapter.<br />These are GREAT generative devices!  (Idea-boosters).  He has great tips for improving dialogue, keeping a scene active, &quot;raising the stakes&quot;-- he doesn't just theorize, he gives hands-on exercises-- which work.<br />I taught playwriting at a small liberal arts college for the first time last spring, and I made this book a requirement.  Because it covers all the basics of play structure and terminology without dwelling in them too much, so it didn't bore my acting students (who were already familiar with the term) and it didn't confuse my writing students (who knew about structure but were unfamiliar with theatrical specifics like &quot;subtext&quot;).<br />I combined this book with Jeffrey Sweet's books and found that these, in combination with the tips my writer friends threw my way, really covered it all.<br />This book is a great resource, and I dip into it from time to time when I'm trying to figure out what to say to a playwright whose play isn't gelling but I'm not sure why.<br />Not to be missed by anyone aspiring to write plays, and a fun read for anyone who just enjoys knowing how playwrights work on their craft.  Entertaining prose, full of examples, and an indispensable manual.	2003-02-06
US	51973726	R38RNVIFUPNPL7	0345423038	703861696	The Wild Road	Books	4	15	19	N	N	Unforgettable, if not always pleasant, hero cat	First:  this is less fun than reading cats as imagined by Paul Gallico and Robert Westall.  Where those two authors' cats always stand firmly in relation to the human world, the people in this world are shadowy figures, either &quot;dulls&quot; (kitten Tag's name for his owners) or menacing.  Oh, there are a few decent people who appear from time to time, but this story is a hero-quest in which animals and people coexist but are not really codependent.<br />Second:  you'll never look at your cats quite the same way again.  While I have not been tempted to reread THE WILD ROAD yet, and it's been a year, it's extraordinary how many of Tag's observations and impressions occur to me on a regular basis.<br />Result?  Nobody who loves cats should miss this book.<br />Warning:  some of the book is a little hard to take-- one of the things Tag is called upon to do, by the magic cat Majicou, is rescue cats who are being captured for experimentation, and there are some pitiful animals who've been through some of it already.  Also, it's very hard to resist constantly &quot;translating&quot; the myth into human terms.  (minor spoiler:  it turns out there IS a rather famous alchemist/scientist who is the villain-- with a touch of real tragedy much of his animal-abuse stems from his fascination with his pet and desire to follow the &quot;wild road&quot; that only cats traveln on-- but, even when this scientist acquires his famous name-- hint-- gravity-- it doesn't really illuminate very much).<br />Resist the urge to translate, if you can.  Situating the events with times and places is interesting, but not as interesting as all that.<br />There are lots of in-jokes for cat lovers and breeders.  I've never had a purebred, but I realized when I began investigating them that Tag and his companions all have logical purebred names.  Loved the joke of the white cat saying &quot;speak up, lovey, I'm as deaf as a post&quot; (white cats genetically are often deaf).<BR>And the image of thenoble, dumb Norwegian forest cat ineptly trying to care for his lady love (until Tag arrives and scolds him that it's food, not a pillow, she needs).  And later seeing the Norwegian Forest cat zig zag down a tree (one of their talents!)  It turns out this pair of illicit lovers (escaped from their breeders to be together) are the king and queen of cats whose rescue is Tag's task.<br />The poetic language and vivid description make this a book of substance.  Think of it as a sort of Arthurian quest with a feline hero (in fact, Tag is called on to bring the cats to Tintagel, which is an Arthurian site, of course) and the occasional vagueness or darkness shouldn't be too troubling.  This is a fairy tale for adults.	2003-02-05
US	51973726	RQSM8YTDDTVUY	0945774079	421119137	Toward the Radical Center: A Karel Capek Reader	Books	3	5	5	N	N	useful, but inconsistent levels of translation	Capek was a genius and an all-around literateur, succeeding with fairytales, novels, plays, and sketches.  He could even draw.  (and he liked cats, which endears him to me).<br />A Czech friend first got me interested in Capek, and made me read WAR OF THE NEWTS, one of his novels, which I adored.  WAR OF THE NEWTS is part of this series.<br />This reader is certainly a good addition to any library, particularly for anyone interested in Capek's work or Czech writing in the Golden Age (the first Republic, before Chamberlain's bargain with Hitler carved up the new state of Czechoslovakia).<br />However, the translations here do not do Capek justice.  While e the translation of the play R.U.R. (a play which introduced the word \\"robot\\" to the English language, and which was once more heavily anthologized and taught in America than O'Neill)does include scenes that were cut from the Broadway productions of 1921 and 1945, scenes never before available in Englishl, the translator also takes idiomatic Czech and makes it oddly formal,  stilted.  \\"To staci\\" for example is translated as \\"That will suffice,\\" which is literally the meaning, but doesn't capture the informality of the phrase.  \\"That's enough\\" would have been more speakable.  If you're a director, use this text only for research but don't give it to your actors-- it will bore an audience, and lacks Capek's humor and zest.  And some of the translation, according to native speakers, is simply inaccurate (a word that can mean \\"scissors\\" in context was translated as \\"provisions.\\") Just as poetry should really only be translated by a poet, plays should really only be translated by playwrights (working with native speakers if necessary).  Too much is lost.<br />Still, the book does put in English, however flawed, much that had been long out of print, and all of it is worth reading.	2003-02-01

A simple dog story it is not.<br />On the surface, this is an accessible easy read; we're in the point of view of Ruslan, formerly a guard dog in a labor camp.  When the camp bewilderingly closes, Ruslan is left to his own devices-- trying to find his commander, trying to get food.  One terrible scene I have never been able to get out of my mind is when a peasant cruelly offers him a piece of bread-- covered with hot mustard, knowing it will cause the dog pain.  No animal lover can read this scene without compassion or tears.<br />And yet.<br />Ruslan is faithful, but the reader knows the system he served was an evil one.  Like the best allegories, this book works fully on all its levels-- as a sheer survival story from a decent, though misguided, dog's point of view the book is sad.  But with the knowledge that certainly any Russian reader would have (and that any reader should have, really) about the changes in Russian society-- this book comes out of the Thaw period, when artists began to be able to critique more openly the repressive Stalinist regime-- the book's real tragedy is almost too much to take.<br />For Ruslan, you see, like so many Russians, had been deceived in his attempt to be a Good Dog.  What Ruslan remembers fondly, the reader with horror can understand as atrocity (attacking prisoners, for example).  (Another book which does this is Martin Amis' brilliant TIME'S ARROW, in which the Holocaust is remembered backwards, so that the narrator recalls resurrecting millions out of ashes).<br />Ruslan comes to a terrible, inevitable end-- the details of which are left to the reader's shivering imagination.  Ruslan sees some people he once knew-- and goes to do his job.  But the world had mysteriously and completely changed.<br />  Poor Ruslan, he was only doing his job-- truly.  The real criminals are the ones who corrupted and perverted his loyalty and decency into serving their evil ends.<br />An unforgettable book.  I wept at its end, and emailed my Russian teacher to complain!  (I got no sympathy; tragedy and sorrow are so Russian, she said).I wept at its end, and emailed my Russian teacher to complain!

It's typical that Hollywood excuses that behavior when the pov is the stalker's-- and this myth just further encourages men to think it's \\"romantic\\" to harass a woman. Gilman has a point.<br />Yes, this play is issue driven, but it is no Lifetime movie with a ready solution or a clear moral.  We're as taken in as the overworked editor by the nice guy she meets on a blind date.  His desperation to please is at first puppy-dog cute.  The mental instability that drives him not to take no for an answer but to persist, first romantically, then violently, as a stalker, is revealed with skill, so that like the main character the audience can feel the walls close in.<br />One of the nice subplots in the play involves an interview Theresa is doing with a publisher of pornography.  Despicable though his profession is, she can't help but liking him personally.  Appearances can be deceiving, and people are more than the sum of their careers.<br />Things go from bad to really bad.  Ultimately, Theresa has to abandon her entire life-- the police can't promise real protection, and though she fires the idiot assistant who thought the stalker's wanting to deliver flowers was romantic (and thus allows the stalker access to Theresa), there will always be another person so taken in.  She won't be safe until she takes on another identity.<br />  Not a lot of people have given much thought to the damage a determined harasser can do.  It's terrifying stuff, and frightening to watch.  Gilman writes wonderful, clear dialogue, and it's an engrossing play to read as well.	2003-01-29

I've never gotten into horse books, and I'd never have read this one had it not been a book club pick.<br />Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be one of my favorite reads of 2002, and one of my favorite books!  The world of horse racing and trading is one Smiley knows inside and out, and she doesn't insult our intelligence by overexplanation-- she immerses the reader in it.  <br />With an unusual structure and multiple protagonist that centers more around the horses then the people, this book is Tolstoyan in its scope, warmth and humanity (and that includes the outlook on the horses)<br />There are lots of characters and horses, but all are memorable.  Generously drawn with some passages so thought-provoking, even profound, that I underlined and dated.   Smiley tells a great story, but the pleasure is as much in her prose and her revelations (a passage about happiness being something that shimmers around you brought me up short) <br />It's a big book-600 pages-but a real epic, and worth it.  Smiley manages to do the pov of a couple of the horses without ever becoming maudlin and anthropomorphic.  There's a horse psychic who describes how the horse sees the world beneath its feet as if rolling in waves-- what an arresting vision of what it must be like to move so fast on four feet.  One of the characters finds herself inexplicably able to grant wishes for awhile.  The book has elements of magic realism in the best tradition-- handled casually, as just another part of life.    <br />Through the journeys of the main horses we see vignettes of owners, traders, gamblers, riders-- all handled with humanity and heart.  It's an incredible testament that she took a subject I'm not inherantly interested in (unlike, say the academic setting of MOO) and managed to captivate me so completely.  The many threads intertwine in a satisfying brocade.  A complete, fully realized world, and a wonderful, engrossing book.	2003-01-28
US	51973726	R37746F3CYD7X2	0156008661	927784160	Ladies' Night at Finbar's Hotel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	gimmicky device, but great, hearbreaking stories	First:  that the authors of the short stories are not identified is a gimmick, and one that is not useful for the American reader unequipped to \\"guess the author.\\"   Second-- the only reason I minded this as much as I did is because the writing was so good!<br />I would certainly have liked to read more work by the authors of some of the stories, particularly the \\"Room 102-- da da da-- daa,\\" in which a fashion designer is confronted by her manic-depressive father-- this story is heartbreaking, vivid, has a sense of inevitability and transcendance that is accomplished with amazing speed.<br />The stories all take place in Finbar's Hotel, once a seedy, traintrack stop, now owned by a rock star and decorated with minimalist cool. But the new decor can't quite hide the hotel's past, and several of the stories involve former residents and workers. The stories were apparently written sequentially as well, as protagonists of early stories are described as peripheral characters in later ones. This is a nice, neat trick that gives the reader a satisfying sense of \\"aha.\\"<br />But overall the stories were simply a feast. My only complaint is the anonymity. They vary in style and tone-- \\"Room 101-- Touchy Subjects\\" takes on a woman whose best friend's husband has agreed to be a sperm donot, what could be just TV-movie or situation comedy is handled with compassion, humor and a portrayal of what love in marriage really is that is very touching. \\"Room 103-- the Debt Collector\\" involves a woman's interview with the man who once ruled her heart and shattered her self-esteem; the reader's knowledge of the woman's real pov as she politely talks to him on the verge of her wedding affords a delicious irony. Other stories involve a nun looking for the right man to sin with, a former maid meeting her illegitimate son, a woman confronting her husband having an affair-- in which she discovers that neither the affair nor her marriage are what she thought they were, and, improbably, an elderly has-been silent film star who trashes the penthouse with a tiger escaped from the zoo.<br />That last story may be a bit OTT with its whimsy, but don't let the other situations fool you into thinking this is just a literary version of PLAZA SUITE. Each story's real subject is Ireland-- the changing mores, the loss, the gains, the growing pains of the Celtic Tiger. And all the writing is, as they say, garjus.	2003-01-28

Like the best in children's fantasy, the magical elements are treated matter-of-factly and mundanely-- making them stand out in even greater relief.<br />Owl is a wereowl-- girl by day, owl by night.  She perches on a tree outside of her science teacher's house and pines for him.  Her witch parents are worried, because Owl isn't doing enough hunting.  (what a great detail-- her parents are like any concerned parents anywhere, except their lives don't really belong to 20th century America).  Kids sometimes tease Owl because they rarely see her eat (she's been known to bring mouse sandwiches to school, though).<br />Owl finally does make a friend, and this both enriches and complicates her life.  The book wraps itself up delightfully-- Owl gets over her crush in a satisfying and original way (hint:  the science teacher has a tragic secret involving a child...) and Owl learns she can trust her friend with her secret.<br />The book's originality and magic had me laughing and marvelling, but the story of a misfit-- a girl with talents that both make her interesting and set her apart-- is one that lots of kids can relate to.  Heck, lots of adults.  This book is full of charm and insight and is a terrific read.	2003-01-28

I think I had read some of her books as a girl.  And every now and then I will read a YA novel.<br />I read it in one afternoon-- I'd have gotten through it sooner, but had to look up and around the room and cry from time to time.   I'll never see the color red in the same way again-- now it's something precious, a gift.<br />This book is far more than a dystopia for kids, or a simple allegory.  Some of the ideas in the book-- the notion of group memory, the questioning of the \\"greater good\\"-- are very sophisticated and presented with great subtlety and art.  But the power of the book lies in its story.  The book takes us on a journey through a world that seems idyllic at first, and it is only gradually, and terribly, that we, with the main character, discover the sadness, the real horror, at the heart of the society.  And perhaps the true horror is that the awfulness is not even understood by the people.  There is no malice in this world.  There is just absence-- absence of memory, absence of attachment, absence of all the complicated feelings that can lead us to love and grace.<br />As he accepts the responsibility to become the receptacle of society's memories, the main character learns how his society really works-- how it eschews, even destroys, those who don't contribute, how it abhors individuality, how it ultimately rejects the idea of love.  And he begins to see in color.<br />This is all discovered through the eyes of a child, and told very simply.  The final escape is much debated-- did he die, or find a better place?  I firmly believe that he found a better place, but in the end it doesn't matter.  What does matter is that once again a human being has discovered what it means to be human.<br />This book truly deserves its awards and should be read not just by teachers and students, but by anybody who enjoys a good story.  Thornton Wilder has the Narrator say in his wonderful play OUR TOWN,to Emily's question, \\"does anybody realize life while they're living it, every, every minute?\\"  \\"Poets and artists, they do some.\\"  After reading THE GIVER, you'll be inspired to remember to do that too.  Life is precious, and its memories, even its painful ones, are an incredible gift.	2003-01-27

While I very much enjoy the PBS series \\"Mystery\\" I've never been much of a mystery reader-- my little experience with it has been that I grow impatient with the prose and am not engaged enough by the literary pleasures of the book, just waiting for the secrets to be revealed.<br />Well this book is a great mystery for people who thought like me.  The prose is wonderful-- it's not so much a whodunnit, although that is part of it, as it is a portrait of a whole town full of cruelty, misunderstanding and pain-- including the guilt of the main character.<br />The first-person narration is wonderful although we do come to learn that the narrator is holding back.  But this seems less a ploy of the genre than a function of the character's psychological makeup-- in short, a fine literary device.  The book also, unusually for an adult novel, though it's common in YA novels, includes examples of email and photographs.  This adds greatly to the uncomfortable feeling of being implicated in the sadness of the past.<br />Warning:  some of the episodes we learn about are hard to take.  There's cruelty to animals, rape, and cruelty to the disabled.  But none of it seems gratuitous, and I found this a very satisfying, harrowing read.  Sneaky, scary and sad.  As with the best mysteries I have read-- I immediately reread it, this time reading the incidents with the benefit of my new knowledge.	2003-01-27

I laughed so hard at the essay on proofreading (one of her friends described her life as a copyeditor as analagous to that of the person sweeping up the dung behind an elephant in a parade) while waiting to board a plane that when I finally walked on, still reading, a woman in first class grabbed my arm and demanded to know what book I was reading!<br />Don't be fooled by the Latin title and &quot;serious&quot; cover.  These essays are tongue-in-cheek, down to earth, and absolutely hilarious, especially if you're a voracious reader-- or have ever had to do any copyediting.<br />Fadiman is humble and self-deprecating, describing her family as compulsive proofers-- I loved the example of them gleefully pointing out errors in restaurant menus.  But it's impossible not to be bowled over by her turns-of-phrase and her wit.<br />The essay about how she and her husband married their book collections is also a standout-- and one that anybody can relate to who's ever been through this, whether it be with books, cds or spices!<br />My only complaint about this book is that it's impossible to put down, and that it's too short.  When I got back from my (business) trip I immediately photocopied the essay on proofreading for the head of marketing, the artistic director, and the managing director of the theatre where I work (there had been a crisis in semicolons in my absence).  This book is a reference for any teacher, writer, reader or marketer.  One of the best reads of the year!	2003-01-27

I'm not a big reader of science fiction, but I had heard good things about his writing and the premise of the book was intriguing.<br />Just released from prison, Shadow learns that his wife Laura has died, and takes up with Loki, somewhat against his will. Shadow is a bit of an enigma and his backstory-- how he came to be in prison, details of his love for his wife-- are revealed slowly and heartachingly. He is much smarter than he seems at first.<br />He gets drawn into Wednesday's battle with Odin, who is in fact an ancient, a battle that will restore the gods to their proper place in society. Many of the gods are rather down-at-heel-- and some of them seem to be new ones-- Media-- a weird incident with the Dick Van Dyke show where Shadow sees Dick beating his wife. And Shadow's wife Laura does not stay in the grave, but hangs around, decomposing, to help him.<br />None of this is fully explained, which is beautiful. Gaiman assumes a very intelligent reader, which I appreciated. He convinces us that he (Gaiman) knows his mythology inside and out, and the power and terror of some of it sticks with me even now.<br />As a whole the book was intelligent, unpredictable, interesting-- and tragic. I withhold one star only because the book was very much a downer-- and maybe that's not fair. It's almost a new genre, a \\"noir fantasy.\\" Really a great read, and unforgettable, nightmare imagery.	2003-01-27
US	51973726	RDFXS0WL4UMGZ	0440229499	859351214	Gathering Blue (Readers Circle)	Books	4	40	42	N	N	Engrossing parable of difficult choices	Like many readers, I was completely floored by THE GIVER.  I had heard Lowry interviewed on NPR, and finding myself in a bookstore not long after, thumbed through the book-- and felt absolutely compelled to buy it.  Reading that book I had to look up several times to wipe away tears, and look around at all the beauties of our own world that we so often take for granted-- like the color red-- singing-- and unconditional love.<br />Now, GATHERING BLUE did not have that impact for me.  But it's a very good example of a YA novel with a smart, kind heroine in a world that is complex, often brutish, and all to human.  Where the world of THE GIVER, we gradually discover, is technologically advanced but emotionally and psychologically regimented, even soul-destroying, the catastrophes have turned the world of GATHERING BLUE to a fierce hunter-gatherer society.<br />It's a world where deformed people are routinely abandoned to death at birth, and where children, or \\"tykes,\\" are redistributed to other families should one parent die, where parenting is full of shouts and slaps (but also, we see in glimpses, some kisses and handholding) and where those who can't contribute or work in an obvious fashion are ruthlessly discarded.<br />For all that, however, it's a world more familiar to the reader than the world of THE GIVER, and somehow, a friendlier place.  Perhaps because family units, however bickering, do exist, or because of the presence of a mischievous child named MATT who even has a pet dog, this world's harshness is less shocking.  Everyone in the world is brought up with it, knows about, no secrets there.<br />There are secrets, however.  Kira is accused by a Vandara, a woman who wants her land (Kira's cottage was burned after her mother's death from illness), but instead of being kicked out of the community, Kira is promoted to weaver/designer-- she has an unearthly talent for it.  As in the world of THE GIVER, there are traces of magic in this universe.  She is takento live in \\"the edifice\\"-- a cathedral that has survived more or less intact from the war.  Unlike the GIVER, there are clues that this is definitely our world.  In the song the singer recites each year at the Gathering, which tells the story of mankind, he lists some names of places that exist no more-- and if you read carefully it's obvious that they are Bogota, Baltimore and Toronto.  There is also clearly a cross in the Edifice.  Nobody remembers what it signifies, but everyone remembers that it's important.<br />As in THE GIVER, however, being promoted for your talented is a mixed blessing.  Just as in that world, having a talent is something that people in power find alluring, and the people in power, even when seemingly protective and kind, may not have your best interests at heart, or be telling you the truth.<br />The title refers to the search for woad, the plant that Kira could use to make blue threads-- blue is a color her own township no longer knows how to make.<br />Despite some startling revelations Kira makes a hard choice to work to improve her own society rather than choose a path that would be kinder to her and her crippled status.  This is a great example for kids and for all of us.  <br />I really liked this book and found a lot in it to ponder.  It didn't sock me in the stomach like THE GIVER-- overall it was a more conventional dystopia-- but I enjoyed reading it.  Oddly however some of the brutishness and coldness seemed harder to believe in-- I have trouble believing a society so clearly human would be able to resist forging stronger bonds of love and friendship than this society seems to.  While it's true that in the middle ages people were more used to death, for example, it's also true from every piece of literature we have from every society everywhere that the altruistic impulse is very strong, as is the parental urge, and it's hard to believe that Kira's loving mother would have been as unusual as all that.  <br />But these are quibbles.  This is a worthy successor to THE GIVER.  It's different and less timeless--I'd recommend the GIVER to everyone, whether or not they read YA or science fiction-- but I'd probably be more selective in recommending this.  But it works quite well as a sort of fairy tale/parable.  And I loved the reference to Jonas (not named) at the end.  He appears to be in a neighboring town.<br />I'm guessing that Jonas' town, the one he escaped from, is the worst of all the societies in Lowry's futureworld.  Looking forward to the sequel which will tie them all together.<br />Someone compared THE GIVER to 1984, and this book to PLANET OF THE APES.  Actually I'd say in impact if THE GIVER were PLANET OF THE APES (and it's hard to remember now but the ending of that movie was a huge sucker punch) than this book is more like BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES.  Less shocking, less horrifying, but still very, very interesting, and a quick read with an interesting heroine.	2002-12-31

But I found it unsettling, too-- there's a cold-bloodedness she and her whole world have towards sex which jars with the emotion she also seems to feel for some of the men so that I didn't get much emotional payoff from the book.  It fascinated, but didn't move.  For example, none of her relationships are exclusive ones; she knows all her boyfriends have other girlfriends (\\"mistresses,\\" since they sleep together), and despite all the attention given to sex nobody ever seems very interested in intimacy-- or in love, despite the title.<br />Still it's a very quick, enjoyable read-- a bit like reading some of the short stories that used to be in Cosmopolitan.<br />I didn't really like Joan or any of her friends, but I didn't mind being in their company.	2002-12-30
US	51973726	RQBXWL5R89LJ5	0156010941	332872233	The Lost Legends of New Jersey	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Teenage Wasteland Rings True	I grew up in New Jersey just a couple of years behind Reiken's character, who is the same age as my brother, and the detail that's gracefully snuck in between dialogue is dead-on.    I read this book when visiting family in NJ.  Every now and then I'd ask, Mom, is there a Conservative synagogue on Northlight?  the answer would always be yes.  Reiken really knows his territory well, and captures the packed-in, yet desolate, feeling the New Jersey suburbs can hold for teenagers.  He even understands the appeal Springsteen's working-class lyrics held for middle-class Jewsih suburbanites.  I also love the matter-of-fact way ethnicity is treated, which also rings very true to my experience.<br />This book flies by almost too fast to catch all the confusion, pain and hope in the life of the main character, whose parents' marriage has ended bitterly, and who has a tenuous relationship with the fast yet sensitive girl next door.<br />It's to Reiken's credit that the characters all maintain some of the mystery of real people-- his mother, for example, has always been mentally unstable-- without resorting to authorial tricks.  Reiken follows the dictum &quot;show, don't tell&quot;-- so although the narrator is unusually perceptive, we don't have to read long passages of explanation.  Instead, a detailed description of seeing his father with his best friend's mother, at a Bar Mitzvah party, sears itself into the brain as it does the main character's.  Reiken doesn't take sides-- everyone in the book has dignity and interest.  A stand-out episode was when the boy and friends get lost trying to get home from the Meadowlands.  Somehow this episode, which combined bravado, innocence, vulnerability and gratitude, sums up the experience of being a teenager-- going through transitions-- in a transitional time.	2002-12-29

Without descending to silly anthropomorphism, he presents the behavior and perspective of the cat with just enough distance so that anyone who knows cats will recognize the authenticity at once.  Lord Gort is a clever, finicky creature who runs away to find her person rather than be stuck with her person's wife and baby during the war.  \\"Psi trailing\\"-- where animals can find their way to their owners, even when they've never been to the place where the owner has moved-- is a documented phenomenon, and scientists still don't really understand it.<br />Second, Lord Gort's travels give Westall an incredible opportunity to present different episodes in the lives of ordinary English people during the way.  So we spend time at a train depot, where Lord Gort is hailed as good luck by hollow-eyed returning soldiers.  She lives for awhile with a Scottish captain whose division is requisitioning a small town, and we see through her proximity a wary but tender relationship develop between the lady of the house, whose officer husband is in Egypt, and the captain.  I was surprised at such a clear depiction of sexual tension and complex emotions in a YA novel, but it's handled subtly and seriously.  Lord Gort is also present at the bombing of Coventry, which many Americans may not really know about-- I didn't.  I knew Londoners were evacuated during the war, but had not realized the extent of the devastation-- a whole town of displaced people on the brink of starvation.<br />There's also a wonderful story, complete in itself, about a young war widow on the brink of a life-killing depression, who is jolted by Lord Gort, somewhat against her will, back into life.  Her story brought me to tears.<br />This book is a very quick read-- I stayed up all night to finish it-- but it has a lot of information in it.  A great book to teach, perhaps at the middle school level, and an enjoyable read for pleasure.	2002-12-29

Don't get me wrong-- I really enjoyed Poisonwood, with its mix of engaging female narrators and insight into a foreign culture and history... this book has some of the same elements.  Taylor, formerly known as Marietta, is a tough, smart, brash Southern gal with a great turn of phrase.  She leaves Kentucky in a beat-up old car, driving West, and along the way, is literally handed a small Indian girl.  She ends up caring for the girl, and settling in Tucson.  There she moves in with another displaced Kentuckian (like Poisonwood, we get a few chapters from another character's pov, but unlike that book, most of the time we stay with Taylor) and finds a job in a bodyshop.  There she meets some Guatamalan refugees...<br />without giving any more away I will say that I had never given any thought to the plight of Guatamalan refugees, but the way Kingsolver drew them into the plot, quietly and gently, I ended up in tears more than once.  There is a scene towards the end that truly had me bawling.<br />I really enjoyed this book-- it was a fast read, hard to put down-- but it had substance, too.  It wasn't just another light, fun, &quot;Southern woman finds herself&quot; sort of novel-- it had real depth, addressing issues of motherhood, family and connections-- as well as the specific issue of refugees (how can a person be &quot;illegal&quot;  a person can be good or bad, but illegal? is typical of Taylor's thoughts-- and it made me stop and think, too).  Highly recommended!	2002-12-26

Most of the book is 20-year old Effie's story.. it's 1972, and she's an unmotivated student at the University of Dundee.  Her chapters, &quot;Chez Bob&quot; (Bob is her Star Trek-obsessed boyfriend she's too lethargic to leave) are hilarious... the descriptions of her friends and the nonsensical situations and conversations will be familiar to anyone who's ever been to college, anywhere.  The excerpts from tutorials (we'd call them seminars&quot; she half-heartedly participates on are exact and funny.  They also provide an excuse to show excerpts from the mystery novel she's writing, the fantasy a friend is writing and a mysterious novel that seems to have supernatural powers taht one of the professors is working on.  Every time we get to an excerpt, the font changes, which is a clear and delightful device<br />For all that the book plays with reality, it still remains clear and not mystified and annoying.  Every now and then we return to the remote Scottish island (the font is more stark there, too) and we get little glimpses of Nora's story as Effie tries to get the story of her birth... Nora is a Virgin and as the book goes on we realize Nora is not her mother... also in Effie's story she is being followed by a mysterious woman...<br />all of  these threads are tied together brilliantly by the end in a conclusion that is logical and satisfying.<br />We also get a brief epilogue set in 1999, largely excerpts from the now-published writings of Effie and her friends, which is short and funny.<br />I laughed out loud at the description of one of the college parties.  Atkinson has a brilliant ear for dialogue and her character descriptions are sharp and clear.  I feel as if I've *been* to Dundee in 1972!  (Thestudent demonstrations and their escalations, and a feminist meeting attended by a doddering, gallant male professor, are particularly wonderful).<br />Don't be put off by some of the lukewarm reviews here-- this is one of the more original books I've read in a while!	2002-12-26

Fresh, amusing and poignant	bravo to O'Faolain for creating a \\"middle-aged\\" woman (main character is turning 50) who's neither sexless, a spinster in a little hat, nor in any other way made cute and cuddly.<br />I was fascinated by the main character's journey-- she goes back to Ireland, having lived in England for a long time and worked as a travel writer, after a dear friend dies.  There she tries to discover the mystery behind an old aristocratic scandal, and begins a novel as part of the process, and begins an affair with a married man.  Along the way we see glimpses into her full but ultimately empty love-life, and cheer her on as she makes, ultimately, a difficult and painful decision.<br />O'Faolain's prose is beautiful without being self-conscious.  She writes of a cat having touched the main character \\"with one plush paw\\" and I've never forgotten it.  The longing and the vividness behind that description have stayed with me.  Similarly an observation about the kinds of kisses that don't leave you pretty struck me hard.  Wonderful dialogue and vivid characters, too.<br />A surprisingly quick read for a thick book.  An Irish friend read it on my recommendation and enjoyed it but thought at times it seemed a little Bridget Jones-like.  It is, in a way-- Bridget Jones at 50, with a more somber and serious outlook than Bridge ever had.  When I finished this book, I felt I had been to Ireland and had lived some of her life.  One of the best reads of 2002, for me.	2002-12-17

Sophomoric logic and an oversimplified approach-- yes the book asks difficult questions, but so does Ayn rand.  If you like propaganda disguised as fiction, you'll love these.<br />That said, books 1 & 2 are very exciting stories, with some wonderful characters in them.  It's only in Book 3 that the preachiness becomes heavy-handed, boring, and near-sighted.  For some of us, the pros/cons of historical Christianity are, believe it or not, irrelevant.	2002-12-12

I found the books utterly engrossing and difficult to put down.<br />I don't know whether the books will offend Christians, but as a Jewish person, I found the association of \\"Religion\\" with what is essentially Christian philosophy (emphasis on Authority, the afterlife etc.) to be muddy and ultimately a bit preachy.  Not unlike Ayn Rand and the way she uses fiction to disguise her propaganda.  Just be warned; if your kids read this they may become anti-religion bores!  :)  I also found the \\"good guys\\" to be questionable (not the kids, but Asriel and his forces) That said, I did enjoy them as stories.	2002-12-10

I have not yet read the book, but I too love the movie, although I keep missing the beginning.  I just wanted to reassure the person posting the question that the book definitely precedes the film, and that yes they are the same story.  You can doublecheck me by just looking at the books on zstores and auctions-- same author, same title, and one has a banner that says &quot;now a Hollywood film!&quot;  The book was published in 1960, the movie came out in 1962.	2002-01-03

Like many, I have the Scholastic editiion with the gorgeous cover picture of Gloria in pink and Mica under a tree.  Even the description of the book in the Scholastic Books catalogs was memorable!  I read and read this book so many times that finally a teacher gave it to me.  I too had a ring with a little green stone, and a &quot;cave&quot; (really just a funny growing bush) in the backyard.  But the stories lose nothing with age-- there is subtle, quaint humor and truth of human behavior throughout.  As I approach my mid thirties I often think of Gloria looking in the mirror... and the story of Bluebell and the goblins really sticks with me.  How Robin said that that goblin hadn't looked one little bit like his Bluebell!  All the choices made throughout are as rich as those in the Harry Potter books-- characters are tested for loyalty, must choose whether or not to be mortal-- and the &quot;framing story&quot; is as good as the individual tales.  This is my all-time number one favorite.	2000-12-28
