I wasn't impressed nor affected.. I thought that what Adeline went through was normal in a family with a stepmother.  In our  - Arab - world  we hear, live through &amp; see a lot of  stories as such, furthermore, most of the arab movies still talk about stepparent's problems. But what I liked most was her persistance, she never gave up, she managed to complete her studies, and earn her living, she went through a bad first marriage, but her second was a blessing. The way I see it; there is a lot of good in her character, unlike the rest of her family, and the good in her, got her through life to success.<br />Being an arab, and coming from a reserved family, I understood her struggle for affection from her parents,  her insistance on getting it till the end, and her struggle to please.  The traditional upbringing, the social &amp; family values in which we're brought up creates, if not strong ties, then strong soical awareness; where everyone in your family counts and has an affect on you, unlike the western societies where everyone lives as a seperate individual.<br />In general, I think its a great book, I enjoyed reading it.	2000-10-02
