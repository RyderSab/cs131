A lot of the prices depend on your bargaining skills. The short chapters cover briefly topics such as accommodation, food &amp; drink (including some vegetarian references), and transportation. As well as some other general tips. The countries include: in Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam, India, &amp; Nepal; in Africa &amp; the Middle East: Morocco, Egypt, &amp; Jordan; in Europe: Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary, &amp; the Czech Republic; in the Americas: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, &amp; Venezuela. The appendices do include a listing of other travel resources, including a couple of websites. If you want a general overview of possible cheap destinations (don't expect a lot of information on sites that you can see) then you might want to give this book a look, but don't expect anything too in depth. This book might best be used to find a country that you may want to visit, you can then buy a more detailed guide book about the country. Although this book will give you a general budget for visiting the country of your choice. In the future you might also want to take into account that the book is from 2003, although because it is so general and the prices depend on bargaining this shouldn't matter too much.	2004-04-14

But I didn't mind since I am just now starting the Brain Ship series. This omnibus contains &quot;The Ship Who Searched&quot; and &quot;PartnerShip&quot;. I enjoyed both stories and look forward to reading the others in the series. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't already have these two books but is an Anne McCaffrey fan. Otherwise, you should probably skip the book.	2004-02-01

It traces their history in Scandinavia, Germany, the United States, and Britian over several hundred years. Of especial interest is the overview of their lives as Jews in WWII Germany. Although they were very lucky compared to others. Another interesting topic is the influence the Warburgs had on America. It is an interesting read, even though it does not go into much detail at all. In spite of the lack of detail it did manage to impart many facinating  facts. I would recommend this book to someone looking for a light nonfiction read. And even though there is a slight emphasis placed on them being Jewish, anyone should be able to enjoy the book.	2004-02-01

In other ways I wasn't. The book seemed to not measure up to the best in the series which was disappointing. Plus it wasn't always consistant with other books. For example, in other books Tahiri Veila seemed to be becoming a part of the Solo family but in this book Han and Leia hardly acknowlage her. However, I did like the fact that Luke had fight sequences. I also liked that he grew in the Force. And that the other Jedi are showing him more respect.	2003-12-23

And I have to say, it's about time. They are the least covered of the 3 draconic types. I've always felt kind of sorry for them. And this book shows that they deserve more respect than they get. They help to save lives in their own way too. I didn't really like the ending though (even though everything really worked out for the best), this probably has to do with an established respect for the bonds between human and dragon as well as human and fire lizard. It just seemed wrong on some level for a watch-wher to be able to change that. Anyway, I would gladly reccommend this book to any McCaffrey/Pern fan.	2003-12-23

The Dolphins are an important part of the history of Pern. The Humans and Dolphins lost touch along the way. Now the old bonds are being reforged. However, not everyone treats the dolphin's with the respect they deserve. Hardly anyone does in fact. Most view them as having less value than dragons, and certainly less than humans. Even though the dolphin's intelligence is equal to human's. But one young man does not feel this way. In fact he is willing to risk everything (including his overprotective mother's rage) to be with the dolphins. This is mainly their tale.	2003-09-30

Although I was not happy with who died in the book (it just seemed so very unfair). Harry has grown, and the stories have grown with him (just look at the book length). This story is more for grownups than for kids. In this book we also find out some important information (information that is going to have an important effect on the rest of the series).	2003-09-30

It follows a group of people, some bad some good, on a journey that takes place mostly in Virtual Reality. The good guys are trying to help a lot of children; while the bad guys are trying to become immortal. While all of this sounds like it has been done before, it's never been done quite like this.

It seems like in a lot of cases just when I'm getting really interested in the story, it ends. I'm the type of person who likes to read full sized or even larger than normal novels. And if the novel is part of a series then even better. That being said the short stories from this book are much more my style, since they are from a series (the Pern series to be exect). This book includes two short stories that have been published before in other books. One short story that is part of a larger story. And one new short story. If you are a fan of the Pern series this book is definately worth having.	2003-06-06

Even though it is not centered around the major movie characters it is still interesting. There are a few known characters that have major roles in this series too. For example, Wedge Antilles and Corran Horn.	2003-01-14

However, it is told from the point of veiw of a writer not an expert climber. For this reason the author makes some assumptions about Anatoli Boukreev that may or may not be true. If a reader wants a more complete picture of events or to view the event from both perspectives I would also suggest reading, The Climb by Anatoli Boukreev.	2003-01-07

It leaves too many questions unanswered. The story doesn't feel complete. Is Tristen the High King? It seems like he is. But in what capacity? And if so for how long? He looks to escape it but it doesn't look like he was meant to escape it. And if he is he will have to overcome alot of problems, especially to have Amefel. And if he is king will he marry and produce an Heir? Can He? And what about Cefwyn's TWO sons? This book could have been better or at least not the last in the series. There should have been one more to tie up all the loose ends from this one. I would like to see another book, maybe one set in the future, that tells what happens to the characters.	2002-08-19
