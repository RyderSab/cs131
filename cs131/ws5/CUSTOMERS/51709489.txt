I do not like at all, all the editorial cuts and even less when they felt they have to remplace it with a cold short story \\"what was cut\\" altering a lot the flow of reading.<br /><br />Or it was not important, and they could have put (...) like elsewere, or they should have left it there. His journals are so important, I am so sorry that I cannot read German, where they are twice as long. Already, the second wife cut some from his words, now the editors and the translators. Really pity !	2005-05-08

The book helps you recognise, what you like, what you are good at, how you would like to spend so many hours left of your life. And then, gives you courage to go for it.	2003-08-21

And then, there are books that impress you even more. This was a like that for me.<br />She writes a romance, with &quot;the stranger&quot; she met by chance and begins with again and then again a new life, she writes with such a romance - I who read hundreds of romances, did not find one having so much of it. She is in love, more, not only with &quot;the stranger&quot;, her husband then and still the stranger, but with a town and its people, and also the places she's decorating romantically, and the foods, and the markets, and - is it a memoir ? true or not ? probably is true, this sensual love of materials, &quot;&eacute;toffes&quot;, taftas and silk etc. cannot be not true.<br />I fell in love with them, and her book, too.<br />I would like to read more memories, more books by her !	2003-08-21

I did not even find it erotic, the tension is not there, I did not root for any of the caracters at almost any time. I do like - a lot - romantic erotism when it is well done, this was not the case with this book, and I think the first story was already published.	2003-08-17

It is perhaps interesting to Science Fiction funs, but there is pracically no romance in it. The relationships are empty and I am sure the author could have done more. She did not put any heart in it so I do not think I will ever buy a book from her.<br />I should have read and listened more to the others writing about it. I do not agree the Sensualility rating about the book either, as the emotion is lacking.	2003-02-12

The book is good and it has some good advices, even so I could not use it (without other information) to write a mistery book.<br />I was not happy, because in the book, most woman, good writers, recognise their lesbian preferences, nowhere was that before I baught the book.
