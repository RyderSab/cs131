Thankfully, this one is also basically Susan Silverman-free (not that I mind Susan, it's all of the repeated conversations about their relationship - it just gets old!)<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's also Hawk-free, so the experienced reader of Spenser books will definitely miss the witty banter the two often share. However, Spenser manages to get in a few good lines without the extra help and he does get a bit of outside help from some unusual sources from the past.<br /><br />The best new 'Spenser' book I've read in quite a while!	2005-10-09

Unfortunately, the setup consists of a series of disjointed flashbacks interspersed with seemingly unrelated tales of what is going on in the present of the novel (1999-2000 in the old USSR, now Russia).<br /><br />Suddenly, once the flashbacks work their way up to the present time the real story starts and it is a great adventure story!  Lots of action, intrigue and frustrated Nazis.  Unfortunately the ending is just too neat - it ends the book with everything too well resolved.	2005-10-09
US	18800155	R175U1QDPZ3BPT	1570424640	418187481	Aftermath	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Levar Burton creates the framework for an epic yet...	...he fails to follow through.<br /><br />Have you ever read a book in which the author takes a premise that would, at most, fill about 150 pages and yet he or she stretches it out to 400 pages? This is not one of those books.<br /><br />This book has the opposite problem - an awful future is described and peopled. The cure for cancer and brain disorders is discovered, stolen and recovered with lots of gunfights, chases, psionic warfare, attempted child rapes, attempted suicides, kidnappings galore, slavery and people being skinned alive. However, none of it is fleshed out - we are left with the skeleton of an epic story - a framework of what could have been. Think Stephen King's 'The Stand' told in less than 300 pages. I just wish he'd added more.<br /><br />I am reviewing this as a book on tape. Levar Burton, well-known television actor, read it, as would be expected - he has a fine voice and lots of experience due to his well known PBS show 'Reading Rainbow.' Sometimes, however, his tone of voice just isn't quite right. He uses the same tone and quality of voice that he uses when discussing a children's book of 'Reading Rainbow' (earnest and happy) when reading about the plight of hundreds of African Americans who have been kidnapped, chained and drugged and are waiting to have their skins forcibly removed. It was more than a little too much dissonance.<br /><br />So, in short, the relatively low score is a reflection of Burton's failure to follow through with the potential of the book.	2005-09-30

Some are very good, most are decent. Two are awful.<br /><br />The gimmick in this alternative history is, of course, 'What if the Battle of Gettysburg had turned out differently?' It is inspired by this Faulkner quote:<br /><br />'For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two oclock on that July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to give the word and it's all in the balance, it hasn't happened yet, it hasn't even begun yet, it not only hasn't begun yet but there is stll time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which made more men than Garnett and Kemper and Armstead and Wilcox look grave yet it's going to begin, we all know that, we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesn't need even a fourteen-year-old boy to think This time. Maybe this time with all this much to lose and all this much to gain: Pennsylvania, Maryland, the world, the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble...'<br /><br />Is it worth reading? If you're a Civil War buff and don't mind 'slumming' by reading an alternative history rather than a normal history book - yes it is worth your time. Personally, I don't think of it is as slumming - I think of it as nice little foray into what-may-have-been. However, alternative histories are often looked down on by more than a few serious readers of history.<br /><br />I would recommend if you are not very familiar with the facts of the Civil War and general and the Battle of Gettysburg in particular that you read the Appendix (the last section) first -  included are the 'Gettysburg Address', three good short histories of the war and the battle and one interesting essay(controversial, but also my favortite) that tells you why the Confederacy never could have won anyway, no matter the outcome of the battle.on) first -  included are the 'Gettysburg Address', three good short histories of the war and the battle and one interesting essay(controversial, but also my favortite) that tells you why the Confederacy never could have won anyway, no matter the outcome of the battle.	2005-09-19

I've regularly read Nancy Pickard's 'Jenny Cain' series and have been heartened by the growth I've seen in her work.  Pickard's detective stories have slowly been growing in power and complexity. This novel, however, may mark Pickard's arrival as a true master of the detective story.<br /><br />I admit that I have not read another of this series, but I was struck by its simple cleverness. The writer of a 'true crime' novel becomes unnerved by doubts concerning the outcome of the trials and criminals that she has recently written about. Her own private investigation, interspersed with chapters from her recently completed 'true crime' book that fill the reader in on the back story, causes a great deal of distress and irritation among both the police and the real criminals.<br /><br />Very well done. Very clever. I'll be looking for more in the series.	2005-09-12

Don't let another reviewer (2 or 3 below this review) fool you  - this is not a book about coddling child criminals. The book is similar to 'The Fugutive'(wrongly accused man on the run), except in this case the runaway is a falsely accused 12 year old boy on the run from the police and, seemingly, the whole world.<br /><br />It is a fun read, but requires a bit of supension of belief when Nathan knows a bit more than most 12 year olds would. But then again, he'd already been through a lot more than most 12 year olds so maybe it wasn't too far off.<br /><br />This is not deep, life-changing reading, but it is entertaining and you find yourself engrossed in his flight for life. I'll be looking for more Gilstrap novels in the future.	2005-09-06
US	18800155	R3URME664O7ENG	0446364401	866749923	First Blood	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Decent, but not Morrell's best work	The copy I have of 'First Blood' includes an interesting forward by the author in which he discusses the Rambo phenomenon that swept the world after the Stallone movies were made. That forward was written several years ago and the Rambo legacy continues today. Just last night I saw a commercial for a Nicholas Cage movie that mentions Rambo twice.<br /><br />Anyway, this is Morrell's first novel and it is not bad. Morrell tries to work in several serious themes and tries to make it a piece of really violent literature rather than settle for just a bit of escapism. In fact, this novel was used for several college and high school classes as a novel to discuss until the Rambo movie phenomenon overwhelmed the books.<br /><br />Even though this was regarded highly enough by some instructors to be used in the classroom, I think that it missed the mark a bit too much - the rivalry between Rambo and the sheriff was a bit too contrived and the Special Forces officer sent to help with Rambo never really worked well for me. He was too aloof, too uncommitted to his soldier (Rambo) or to the people he was sent to protect.<br /><br />As an action thriller this book seemed overblown - it reminded me, ironically, of the Rambo II movie (Morrell discounts Rambo II and III because he had little say in the screenplays. He wrote the novelizations in an attempt to salvage a bit of the flavor of his original character) - too over the top. Just too much.<br /><br />I rarely say this, but now I have said it in two of my last three reviews - the movie is better than the book. The motivations of the Rambo character are more defined (even though the sheriff and deputies are reduced to stereotypes of redneck country cops) and, ironically, the action in the blockbuster Hollywood action flick is more believable than in the book.	2005-09-02

Having read Jeffrey Shaara's prequel and sequel to his father's 'The Killer Angels' and his novel on the Mexican War, I had formed an impression of Shaara as a good -  but not great -writer of historical fiction, especially when compared to his father.<br /><br />'Rise to Rebellion' may mark a turning point, however. This novel is so strong, so compelling that I consider it his best so far and, perhaps, the equal to his father's work. The characterization is excellent, the issues are laid out in a natural way so that the reader does not feel like they are being lectured to. The characters feel like real people.<br /><br />I recommend this book without hesitation. Very well done. I can't wait to move on to the next one.	2005-09-01

I wasn't even aware that 'The Princess Bride: S Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure' was even a book until I was looking through the special features on my DVD and they were speaking of the difficulties they had bringing the book to the big screen. Once I found out about the book I just had to get it!<br /><br />So, is it better than the movie?<br /><br />While I certainly enjoyed the background information on Fezzik and Inigo, this is one of the first books that I can honestly say is better as a movie. Notice, that I have given this book 5 stars, so we are distinguishing between very good and very, very good here. Still, the movie is a further abridgement of S. Morgenstern's classic tale (wink, wink) that makes the story even stronger.<br /><br />My edition had a wonderful new introduction the recounted some of the struggles  and joys in making the movie and includes the first chapter of the long-lost 'sequel' entitled 'Buttercup's Baby.' Both are worth your time.	2005-08-18

The planetary government is in a shambles and the Enterprise is dispatched to aid in whatever way possible. However, Enterprise is having a series of computer failures and is not up to full capacity so things get tricky for Kirk and the crew.<br /><br />Ferguson has written an adequate Star Trek novel - his main characters are written very solidly, but his supporting characters are rather like cardboard cutouts. The women weep and the men clench their teeth and pound their fists in anger at the news of the terrorist attack.<br /><br />Having the benefit of hindsight in regards to the 9/11 attacks, I found the behavior of many of the characters to have been inplausible at best, including doctors taking time away from the thousands of refugee patients to tour the Enterprise and especially the Mardi Gras-type partying that was going on in the new capitol city just a few days after a million people were killed in the planet's old capitol city. Remembering the somber mood of the country after 9/11 that went on for weeks with only a few thousand deaths, I found it to have been a jarring, hard to believe part of the story.<br /><br />The first half of the story was really much, much better than the contrived second half. It is the first half that pulls it up to the third star and makes this a book that I recommend, albeit weakly.	2005-08-13

No, the problem lies in the main character - the artist/part-time investigator. As an artist he's an outright ditz. As an investigator he's just a step below James Bond. I had no sense that he really was the same guy. How did this artist get this part time investigator's job? It just felt like a contrived fit the whole time.<br /><br />In addition, the evil villain's evil plot seemed like an awful lot of work - perhaps more than it was worth. Plus, his evil plan wasn't particularly evil, more like it was misguided - and definitely not worth killing a lot of people over.	2005-08-09

Most likely it is the best book that I'll read this year - if I read something as good or better than I'll be a fortunate reader indeed!<br /><br />Pressfield drags you into the story and makes you feel like you are there - in an ancient battle - in the maelstrom of death and destruction and blood and confusion. Pressfield takes a spare skeleton of a story passed down to us in our modern age and makes it do more than just come alive - you almost feel like you were there and that you know these characters personally. That is a true gift.<br /><br />I have but one quibble - the map in the front of the book is a big help, but it would have been better if it had been more detailed. I wish that it would have included all of the city-states mentioned in the book as well as have included the roads that the main characters (and the armies) take multiple times.	2005-08-07

Don't get me wrong - I am came to this book as a true fan of Bernard Lewis. His book 'Crisis of Islam' was one of the more thought-provoking books I read last year. However, this book is quite different than 'Crisis'. It's scope is massive, and it is a history book rather than a work of examination and informed conjecture.<br /><br />Lewis addresses these shortcomings in his introduction and admits that it will be a difficult undertaking to do it well. He acknowledges that whatever format he chooses to cover this history, it will be unsatisfying for some. I give him credit for doing it well, but not as great as the other books and articles of his that I've read.<br /><br />The book is broken up into three general sections. The first is a general overview of the Middle East over the last 2,000 years. It is a bit overwhelming and frustrating. Overwhelming because the empires, dynasties and civilizations rise and fall so quickly that I felt like I was watching a time-elapsed movie. It was frustrating because there were some new areas (for me) that I really wished he would explore, such as the link between the Persians and the Jews of the Roman Era. I was also intrigued by the Coptic Christians, but learned little more than I already knew. Lewis is fairly skimpy with the life of Mohammed and the early spread of Islam as well. I give this section 3 stars.<br /><br />The second section is called 'Cross sections' and it deals with specific topics throughout the 2,000 years of history, such as the military or agriculture. I give this section 4 stars.<br /><br />The last section goes into the struggles the Middle East has experienced since Europe and the West have become such a vital part of the world since the European Renaissance. This is Lewis' strongest area and by far the most interesting to read. I give this section 5 stars.<br /><br />So, the average of the 3 sections is 4 stars - my final score for this book.	2005-08-03

I read 'The Pardon' many years ago, but reading the first book is not a necessary requirement - Grippando sets the stage very well in this book so it can be a 'stand alone' novel.<br /><br />I shot through this book very quickly - the plot drags you in pretty well and Grippando's writing style keeps the book moving along at a quick pace. The main character is fairly average and his world is suddenly turned upside down by one case and its connections to the underworld. Murder, mayhem and one family crisis after another keep it interesting. Grippando fills this novel with a multitude on interesting characters, any one of which would be strong enough to be the main character in a book.<br /><br />A good solid read - a great summertime novel.	2005-07-25

My copy of this book had a snippet from a review from the Chicago Sun-Times in which they said it was a 'rawboned' mystery. I was intrigued by that characterization and can now report to you what that means.<br /><br />It means that this mystery is sparely written - no extravagent detail and most conversations aren't even fully fleshed out. It's a quick and dirty read about some quick and dirty crimes set in two small towns in Depression-era South Dakota. In style and setting it reminded me of a western. The hero, Carl Wilcox, comes upon a wrecked car. Inside are four dead adults and one survivor - a little girl.<br /><br />Wilcox is eventually hired on by local bigwigs to investigate the circumstances of the crime, seeing as how he has previous experience as a police officer. Wilcox starts to pull at the loose threads of this crime and starts to discover that some very prominent local names are being implicated in these murders and other crimes.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the story is the budding personal life of Wilcox. One of the local ladies enjoys serious flirtation with him and the little girl he saved from the wreck who trusts no one but him. It is enjoyable to follow along with Wilcox's discomfort and awkwardness in dealing with this traumatized little girl. He has obviously been a loner for a while and suddenly he is looking at the prospect of a family and dealing with having to sing little kid sings in the car and telling stories before bed time.<br /><br />This is a solid little read. Now I'll be on the lookout for other books labeled 'rawboned'.	2005-07-21

More on that later.<br /><br />Van Doren's 'A History of Knowledge' is a truly remarkable book. He breaks down a number of key philosophies and religions and makes them palatable to the reader and also demonstrates their influence over time. It is a very well written book - very enjoyable to read.<br /><br />He is particularly good at succintly describing why the end of the Roman Empire was such a disaster for knowledge and explaining why the Church was afraid of the astronomy discoveries of the Renaissance.<br /><br />Problem areas:<br /><br />-He almost exclusively focuses on Western Thought. Very little Asian philosophy, except for Confucious. How can it be a History of Knowledge when it leaves out most Asian thought?<br /><br />-Sometimes he blithely labels things as fact. For example, he claims that Jesus was born on December 25th while every Christian church body on the planet merely claims that it is the observed day of his birth.<br /><br />-He asserts that Martin Luther wanted his religious opponents to be murdered in the Thirty Years War. I know that Luther railed against his opponents but he also railed against religious war. Perhaps Van Doren is confusing Luther's strong support for a violent response to the incredibly violent Peasant's Uprising of his younger days. That was not so much a religious war as a response to the brutal treatment the peasants received. Luther was not sympathetic to the peasants since they had burned churches and killed priests.<br /><br />-Van Doren goes onto shaky ground when discussing Darwin's Theory of Evolution when he supports it by saying that breeds of dogs are a great proof of this theory. I say that this is shaky ground because different dog breeds are not new species. This same argument is used by racists who claim that the different races are fundamentally different from each other due to breeding. It was an especially poor choice of an argument.<br /><br />Van Doren's book goes off track when he gets to his future section. Until I reached that section, I had been telling my wife and my friends that I had been reading a phenomenal book - wonderfully thought out and written. Then Van Doren indulges in silly speculations about the future. His predictions about computer technology completely missed the direction that we took. He is very concerned about Artificial Intelligence, a field that is not nearly as hyped as it was when he wrote his book. Unfortunately, he sounds like he's a supporting writer for the movie 'I, Robot' rather than a serious writer.<br /><br />He also advocates the need for a World Government, but the arguments he makes sound flat when compared to the history that he has just written - a history that warns of the dangers of concentrations of power. What is the old saw about learning history so as not to repeat it?<br /><br />So, if I were grading the first 85% of the book, it'd be a solid 5 stars. However, that last 50 pages is truly awful and the overall score is dropped.<br /><br />Despite the fact that most of this book deals with problems I have with the book, I do heartily recommend the book - just not the last section.hed that section, I had been telling my wife and my friends that I had been reading a phenomenal book - wonderfully thought out and written.

I finally got around to reading it and I can see why it was in such demand.<br /><br />Follett introduces the reader to the turbulent politics on 1760s England, Scotland and America. He throws in a liberal dose of romance and the reader will be reminded of the Tom Cruise / Nicole Kiddman epic movie 'Far and Away'. There are plenty of similarities - both feature poor, rural heroes who fall in love with the landlord's spunky daughter. Nevertheless, it's a great read and unique enough to stand up in its own right.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a view of England's politics and turmoil on the eve of the American Revolution - it puts America's arguments for revolution in a clearer context - it even strengthens them.	2005-07-16

He predicted that the U.s. would become involved with Sadaam Hussein in Iraq over WMDs. (Ironically, in this book, Sadaam tries to nuke France in 2006)<br /><br />3. Carr does an interesting thing by writing a sci-fi book that sounds Victorian.<br /><br />4. His beginning themes of capitalism gone amuck are interesting, despite their misguided nature.<br /><br />What does he do wrong?<br /><br />1. There is little or no character development. Even our main character is minimally fleshed out. He joins a group of anti-information age terrorists with little or no qualms, despite the fact that he knows nothing about them, he's confused by their cause. We learn little about these people except that they know everything about him - and they don't share any of their information with the reader.<br /><br />2. This team of people is like the supersmart Justice League - they all have wonderful skills and abilities that complement one another - but we know precious little about them or their motivations. Plus, the only skill exhibited by one of these 'super friends' just seems to be that he can cook gourmet meals in a hurry.<br /><br />3. They have a super airplane/submarine that can make itself invisible. It is nearly untouchable and is practically unbeatable. Also, its boring after a while. There's no challenge since they always have their super ship.<br /><br />4. This book would have been much, much, much more interesting if Carr would have expanded on each of these 'superfriends' and explained their motivations. Carr could have let us see this world through all of their eyes and made it more interesting than the straightahead approach he often uses. Carr only approaches this with two characters - what about the rest?<br /><br />So, if I were giving it a grade, I'd give it a solid 'D' - weak character development and presence of the 'super ship' are offset by initial interesting themes and visions of the future. If Carr were a student in my class, I'd send him back to do a lot of revising.ahead approach he often uses. Carr only approaches this with two characters - what about the rest?

I borrowed this book from my mother - I picked it up off of the shelf and after reading the first 3 or 4 pages I knew that I had to finish it. So, I borrowed the book and was happy with it and its light and humorous telling of the long and ocassionally tortured history of the English language.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />the mistakes and problems started to pile up. Bryson illustrates a lot of  his points by showing the reader how other languages had similar developments. Most often he uses French and German, which is appropriate considering their close ties to English. On occassion, though, he uses Spanish, which is something that I am sensitive to since I teach Spanish. Mr. Bryson's assertions about Spanish accents and pronunciation were wrong more often than right. Too bad Mr. Bryson did not have a Spanish speaker actually pronounce a few of the words for him so he could see that his points were flawed from their inception. It called into question the rest of his pronouncements.<br /><br />To make it worse, this normally breezy, fun book gets seriously bogged down about halfway through - but it does pick up rather nicely  - only to get mired down again at the very end with a seemingly endless discussion of palindromes and crossword puzzles.<br /><br />Do I recommend the book - yes with reservations. There are lots of wonderful things to be read in it - just bring along your grain of salt, and occasionally your ability to skim!	2005-06-27

It's about friendship, sex and, ultimately, love(audiobook)	Published by Random House in 2005<br />Read by Titus Welliver<br />Duration: 4 hours, 57 minutes<br />Unabridged<br /><br />There are four main characters in this story: Marshal Virgil Cole, Deputy Everett Hitch, Bragg (a rancher/hotel owner) and Mrs. French, a pathetic woman that leeches onto powerful men out of some deep seeded need that we never quite have explained. Suffice it to say, Mrs. French is a survivor because she uses sex to endear herself to the most powerful man in her immediate area.<br /><br />In this case, the woman is a pathetic, despicable thing.  Robert B. Parker loves to explore the sometimes complicated psychology of men and women and the way they express friendship and love, both platonic and amorous. His books are full of people (mostly women, but not always) that claim to be in love but really they are psychologically needy and act out sexually in strange, disruptive ways.<br /><br />There are four main characters in this story: Marshal Virgil Cole, Deputy Everett Hitch, Bragg (a rancher and later a hotel owner) and Mrs. French, a pathetic woman that leeches onto powerful men out of some deep seeded need that we never quite have explained. Suffice it to say, Mrs. French is a survivor because she uses sex to endear herself to the most powerful man in her immediate area.<br /><br />But, the problem is, who is the most powerful man? Is it the Marshal, Bragg or even the Deputy? And, will they even realize they are being manipulated? Does she even know she is doing it? Can the Cole and Hitch's friendship endure this tension?<br /><br />The audiobook is read by the actor Titus Welliver. I like Welliver's work and his voice is smooth and mellow - just about perfect for Hitch, who tells the story.	2005-06-21
US	18800155	R1SNV9TKUQV1LF	1400049571	87612577	Feathered Serpent: A Novel of the Mexican Conquest	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Very good, wonderful historical detail	In my mind, the Aztecs have been short-changed by modern authors. There has not been enough attention to them and their interesting story. And Cortes! If ever anyone should get high marks for having ambition and bravery in spades, it's him.<br /><br />Anyway, the historical details are well done in the book. Falconer almost makes you feel like you are there with the Spanish as the arrive at the Aztec city of Tenochitlan. He has created a multi-dimensional Cortes, rather than the stereotypical 'evil conqueror' Cortes (although, at the end I lost the feel for Cortes - I don't know if Falconer lost interest or he also lost his feel for the man). In most books and texts Cortes is portrayed as a gold-crazed, land-crazed conqueror - but his motivations are far more complex - including a complete disgust with the Mesoamerica's fascination with human sacrifice and the cannibilistic consumption of those sacrifices.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Falconer's obsession with adding graphic, detailed sex scenes to his book just gets in the way. Another reviewer commented that there's one about every twenty pages - and I'd agree. We get all of the detail that adds nothing to the plot. I'm not trying to be a prude here - after all the main characters were considered to be the first to have a mestizo child so there's got to be some sex - but it was given such a prominent place in the book that I feel that it detracts from the work as a whole.	2005-06-18

'Cradle and All' is like a secret stash of Oreos - you eat them in bunches but you're not real proud of it. This book, for me, was a real page-turner. I shot through the thing at a near-record pace and I was really into it. However, it wasn't the type of book that I'm going to go bragging about to anybody (kind of like those Oreos, I've got stashed away - who brags about eating 10 of those?).<br /><br />Readers beware, this is a re-working of one of Patterson's early books 'Virgin'. It's been more than 20 years since I've read 'Virgin' so I can't really remember enough precise details to tell what he has changed, but the basic story seemed like what I hazily remember.	2005-06-12

This book is also slow while Lawhead lays the groundwork and has the reader join with an enterprising group of 13 monks from Ireland and Britain that head off for a pilgrimage to Constantinople.<br /><br />Like a roller coaster, once this book finally gets moving (around page 90 or so) the pace never stops and the reader is drawn into a wonderful world and is exposed to four cultures (Irish, Viking, Byzantine, Arab), is taken into slavery, lives the life of luxury, suffers from religious doubt, climbs to the heights of faith, fights corruption, is betrayed and travels the world in a whirlwind fashion.<br /><br />This wonderful story, based on a composite of Irish monks (check out Lawhead's website for more info) from the 9th and 10th centuries, is a joy to read.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /><br />This is my first Lawhead book but it won't be my last.	2005-06-09

While I did find it entertaining, the ending had one plot twist too many and I found the Women's Murder Club plot device to be forced, at best.<br /><br />Yes, I realize that these four women are the basis for a number of other books to follow and the character development will follow but, to me, it seemed like the pilot episode of a TV show - you get to meet all of the characters, they do something cool so you'll continue to watch and the character development will follow.<br /><br />Based on this first novel, I doubt that I'll continue on with the series - there are too many other books in the library to read!	2005-05-30

Is that fair? I guess you'll be the judge.<br /><br />Cawthorne's \\"Witch Hunt: A History of Persecution\\" is a recounting of the witch hunt craze that infected not only Salem, Massachussets, a topic with which most Americans have a least a passing familiarity,  but throughout Europe to a much, much larger degree. The back of the back says that this book \\"...examines this persecution and the religious hysteria which inspired it.\\" To me the use of the word examination implies that the author will interpret this hysteria and make observations and insights throughout the reading. Cawthorne does not do anything close to this, with the exception of a brief, four page introduction. Rather, he recounts witch trial after witch trial, often going into great detail about the tortures used and the indictments brought against the accused witches.<br /><br />While this is an impressive bit of research, the book felt half-done. Like Cawthorne had written up his research notes and then had to hurry off to write something else before he added his own touches. What he leaves us with is more than 200 pages of torture, false accusations and descriptions of supposed orgies between witches and Satan. The first dozen times I read about them, I was interested. By the 50th time, they become most wearisome.<br /><br />So, what does this book do well? It is a wonderful resource for someone wanting to know basic facts about the ways that the Spanish Inquisition and the Witch Hunts physically tortured and financially abused their victims. I'll keep it as a resource for my world history class just for those topics.	2005-05-23

The chapters are short and sweet and hilarious!<br /><br />Tally introduces us to Vice Presidents who assumed that they were really assistant presidents, vice presidents who never really showed up to work, vice presidents who showed up to work but really shouldn't have bothered and vice presidents who never really grasped the idea that they were supposed to work with their presidents to get things passed through the Congress.<br /><br />For the researcher paper writers out there, Tally's work would be inappropriate to use as the main source of your information, but it would make a fantastic book to add that little bit of extra to make your paper more interesting to read!<br /><br />This was truly an enjoyable read. I borrowed mine from the library but I'm adding it to my wish list here because I want to have a copy of my own!	2005-05-19

They remain petty, impudent little pests and I found myself wondering why the other races tolerated the human species if this was all the better that they were going to meet!<br /><br />Seriously, the actual sci-fi was top-notch. There were a multitude of worlds and species that were well-done. But, it was marred by the inclusion of a punk rocker, a geek and a ditzy blond who continued to bicker, and sometimes actually fistfight with one another, no matter the situation. I wish he'd haven given that aspect of the story a rest.	2005-05-15

This book wanders and meanders its way through American history and, while this may bother other reviewers, personally, I love it. For me, it was as if I were able to sit and listen in on a conversation with a master story-teller.<br /><br />Ambrose discusses such things as the hypocrisy of Jefferson ('unalienable rights?' for all men - how about your own slaves?) and most of the Founding Fathers - but still he does not just topple them for their hypocrisy - he also points out, with wonder, that they accomplished the near-impossible. He also notes the seeds for social change that they all planted, such as universal education (Jefferson). In fact, he directly confronts the 'but he was a slaveholder' mentality - acknowledge the terrible fault - in fact, insist on acknowledging it. But, judge them by the whole of their work.<br /><br />Ambrose covers such flawed men as Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt in a similar fashion. He also discusses other things that he had a hand in, such as D-Day museum, the Band of Brothers TV shows and the process of writing.<br /><br />Ambrose also throws in his own personal experiences - both with items of a historical nature (such as his own experiences as a vocal protester of the Vietnam War - some he's proud of and others that he wished he wouldn't have done) and his own experiences with success and tragedy.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable.	2005-05-15

I laughed out loud and I couldn't wait to open the book back up.<br /><br />Then, the psychobabble began. There was way, way, way too much relationship study between Spenser and Susan about Spenser and Hawk. Enough already! We know that they'd do anything for each other - not out of debt but out of male-bonded love! We got that during the last book and the other 15 or so that have had this exact same conversation (except in shorter form!)!!<br /><br />Too bad, because Parker's last Jesse Stone novel was the best of the series and his Jackie Robinson back \\"Double Play\\" was very, very good. This one was not up to those high standards.	2005-05-14

You see, I read a description of the book that described it as a serious look at the phenomenon of \\"Spanglish.\\" It does have that (and it is quite good) - but 2/3 of the book is a Spanglish to English dictionary. While interesting, it was not what I had planned on reading when I had requested it from my local library. I just wanted you perspective buyers to know ahead of time.<br /><br />Also, if you don't have a decent command of Spanish, this book will be pretty hard for you to read. If you have a hard time following the jokes in a George Lopez stand-up routine, you'll have just as hard of a time reading this book because he fills it full of Spanglish. While entertaining to us bilinguals, I wanted warn you before you bought it.	2005-05-02

Nonetheless, I will proceed to put in my two cents worth in the name of foolish consistency...<br /><br />I like to recognize authors who have successfully created their own unique worlds in which their characters live and breathe. Tolkein achieved it with Middle Earth, Lucas creates new galaxies for the Star Wars saga and Adams has done the same in a few pieces of open fields surrounded by trees and a small river in the English countryside.<br /><br />It is more than a story about rabbits, it is also a story about the nature of government and the advantages of freedom of association. Far from perfect (one could easily edit out 50 pages wihout harming the story), it nonetheless draws the reader in to the rabbit warren. At the end, you just care about these rabbits!	2005-04-27

Why?<br /><br />He mixes together so many things that he is passionate about in his other books - baseball, the tough guy persona, relationships between men and women, the mafia. It's all here and it's all wrapped up in the compelling story of Jackie Robinson.<br /><br />Parker also includes a number of autobiographical sections in the novel in the form of the memories of \\"Bobby\\", a young boy who listens to the Dodgers games on the radio. At first, I thought the Bobby character was unnecessary fluff, but he is used quite effectively to showcase the general sentiment of the baseball fans toward race.<br /><br />Well done.

Dr. Stout's introduction to sociopathy is simplistic, as some have asserted, but that is because it is an introduction for the layman. I am just such a layman and I understand that she has simplified things for me so that I can have some understanding that there is a significant minority of us that have no empathy for anyone or anything. That makes them a pest at best and downright deadly at the worst.<br /><br />Stout addresses a number of issues about sociopathy, including the omnipresent \\"nature vs. nurture\\" debate that is present in every discussion of psychology. Her conclusions? I'll leave that for the you to read.<br /><br />At times, Stout tends to wander afield and get into more esoteric areas, such as religious philosophy. These passages are, happily, a small part of the book. Generally, the book was well-written, easily understood and most importantly, I left this book thinking that I now have a better understanding of some of the more incomprehensible people I've known throughout my life.	2005-04-08

This is my third Fitzhugh book and I have to rank it in second. It is funny, but at times his characterization of New Yorkers as oblivious and callous to the violence that can be inherent in that city is even a bit much for me.<br /><br />The overall premise is funny but the book somehow fails to hit the high level of promise that this reader anticipated. That said, this would be a heck of a good movie if you get the right actors involved.<br /><br />If you've never read a Fitzhugh novel, I'd recommend 'Cross Dressing' to start with instead.	2005-04-04

This book about betrayal and family ultimately left this listener (I heard it as a book on tape, narrated by Bruce Weitz of 'Hill Street Blues' fame)wondering what the point of the novel was. Nick O'Hara, our protagonist and NYPD detective, is upset when he discovers that his grandfather on his mother's side ordered the killing of his father when he was a boy and was obliquely responsible for the death of his son in a gangland dispute.<br /><br />So, Nick goes after his grandfather by becoming a spy in the family organization. Along the way, he betrays his own wife and breaks his relationship with his father's brother - his only blood relative he trusts.

I hadn't thought about Charles Kuralt for years - until I ran into his book on tape entitled 'Summer.'  Kuralt pulls summer-based items from his reports from CBS News and reminds us (this listener anyway) that we've missed his folksy approach on the reporting on everyday life in America since his passing a few years ago.<br /><br />Kuralt lays it on a bit thick from time to time but he avoids being too schmaltzy as he reports to us about Maypole dances in Minnesota and tubin' down the Apple River in Wisconsin. The best reports are on side two, where he focuses on the Fourth of July. He travels to Gettysburg and Independence Hall, New York City and Brazil and takes us along for an emotional ride.<br /><br />Although he takes a lot of his footage from his television reports, only once or twice did this listener feel that he was missing something by not actually seeing the pictures.	2005-03-29

I avoided this book on tape because its read by Burt Reynolds and I figured that if anybody has a chance to ruin a Spenser novel it would be Burt Reynolds.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />Despite his talent for finding bad movies, Reynolds is, underneath it all, a real actor. He finds the voice for the wise-cracking Spenser and hits it dead on. Spenser's observations and one-liners are read perfectly. Not only that, but he covers the voices of all of the mob leaders and his characterization of Shirley Meeker/Ventura gives the reader a great deal of sympathy for how truly pathetic and harmless she was as she got herself caught up in events beyond her control.<br /><br />Reynold's portrayal of Hawke was different (more southern, but just as tough) because in my mind I always picture Avery Brooks and his precise delivery of lines. But, once I got used to it, it was very good.<br /><br />Now, on to the book. Typical Spenser - wise-cracks, a little violence and a lot of people irritated about him sticking his nose in their business. In this case, Spenser spends a lot of time in Vegas and he isn't very fond of the strip. Susan isn't  prominent in this book, but she does her level best to drag down every scene she's in with her incessant discussions about Spenser's character as a man.<br /><br />Normally, I would give this book 4 stars, but the reading by Reynolds was strong enough that I had to bump it up to 5 stars.	2005-03-23

This is probably my 40th plus Parker book. While the Jesse Stone series was much improved by its last offering, I think this was the weakest of the Sunny Randall series.<br /><br />The mystery part of the book was excellent, but Sunny spends forever in a day seeing Susan Silverman, expert psycholgist and also Spenser's girlfriend. The book gets bogged down with too much detail about feelings, Oedipal complexes and the like.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Sunny and I'll read the next Sunny Randall book. I'm just hoping that this book was a bridge to Sunny going on to bigger and better things and moving away from this self-pitying/loathing over her strange relationship with her ex-husband.<br /><br />One has to wonder, will Spenser and Randall bump into one another? Randall knows cops that Spenser knows, she's been to his girlfriend's house...  Do I want to see that? yes and no. Sometimes its best to leave the characters in their two different worlds, but its also fun to mix and match, as 'Law and Order' likes to do on occasion.	2005-03-23

If not, let me assure you, you will be bounced around without warning and it will be quite unpleasant until you get used to it or until the driver gets better.<br /><br />In the case of 'Eyeshot', you'd better get used to it.<br /><br />Hightower has created a wonderful concept for a police novel - how do you get the criminal when the suspect is a high profile prosecutor? Her characters work the outside edges of the system until they can finally make their move and it is an interesting concept and quite the challenge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is made even more challenging by Hightower's choppy plot lines. Oftentimes, I felt like I was coming in to the middle of a scene or a conversation - the characters were meeting people I did not know - nor did I get clued in until much later on. Conversations were started and spoken almost completely in the shorthand that characterizes friendships - but I'm not friends with these people so I have no idea what they're talking about! It is not a good thing to make the reader feel like the third wheel!<br /><br />So, I gave the book 3 stars, which means I do recommend it. Let me explain my reasoning. The underlying plot is so strong that the annoying habits of the writer do not overcome it. Or, to put it another way (and to return to my first analogy...) - I just got used to her poor use of the stick shift!	2005-03-17

No one writes better than Morrell when it comes to the \\"fugitive\\" novel - one man hunted by many in a cross-country chase.<br /><br />In this case, a military intelligence deep cover operative has been accidentally exposed and an operation goes sour. Soon, the operative is being blackmailed and chased by an attractive reporter and the unwanted attention causes the operative's handlers to \\"terminate\\" a number of people and the operative comes to believe that his own life is in danger as well. Throw in a damsel in distress (actually two) and a James Bond-esque villain and the chase is on!<br /><br />Unfortunately, a great story is slightly marred by the protagonist's constant internal psychobabble about who he really is (he confuses himself with the various personas he's become over the years). An even bigger problem is the ultra-rich villain. He's a parody of the James Bond super villain. The climax of the book is hokey and almost laughable. Too bad that a 400+ page book is marred by 10 pages at the end. A worthwhile read but be prepared.	2005-03-10

Is it justice denied? Is the theme the importance of family? Is it the value of good journalism? Yes, no and maybe.<br /><br />Dexter's book is about three newspapermen - two brothers (one with no personality and one that can't figure out what he wants to do except hang around the newspaper for a lack of anyplace else to go) and their father (he's just as annoying as his sons - maybe more so - because at one point he has a personality but by the end of the book he's faded, too).<br /><br />It's also about corrupt local politics that, in the end, did the right thing when they stuck a man in jail with inconclusive evidence. It even includes a sexism, racism, class-bias and even gay-bashing. Dexter tries to write the \\"Great American Novel\\" and it shows. He tries too hard and, in the end, he gets nowhere because he is unfocused.<br /><br />A bit of advice to Dexter - keep the story simple to make the point better. Look to the example provided by \\"Of Mice and Men\\" - a simple plot full of simple, living characters that illustrate deep and profound thoughts on life. By contrast, Dexter flounders around so much with his ghostly characters that he just irritated this reader.	2005-03-07

I know Johnstone's MOuntain Man series is extremely popular - I used to work in a used bookstore and we had a hard time even keeping them on the shelf! So, I was really looking forward to delving into this new series of books.<br /><br />I was really disappointed. Not because it was not readable - it was. But, because I quickly lost interest in the main character. I did not see the point in reading about him. So, I stopped after 65 pages since...<br /><br />...He is unstoppable - he cannot be outdrawn in a gunfight.<br /><br />He can't be outfought in a fistfight.<br /><br />No one hunts better than him.<br /><br />No one rides better than him.<br /><br />No one tracks better than him.<br /><br />No one shoots better than him.<br /><br />No one is smarter than him.<br /><br />No one can beat him.<br /><br />In fact, no one is even a challenge to him at all.<br /><br />Well, if that's the case, why even read the book?<br /><br />I would compare it to watching Superman take on a 3rd grade basketball team. Why watch? You know the outcome and its bound to be ugly.<br /><br />In this case, I knew who was going to win and there was no point to reading anymore. There was no challenge for him to overcome.

It literally depends on the section of the book you are in.<br /><br />Prosecutor Al Caproni has a message brought to him that a drifter named Heartstone wants to see him a about a long-past high profile double murder that he helped to prosecute. The narration then flashes back to the night of the murder and follows the original investigation and prosecution of the case.<br /><br />At times, this section really drags. A star witness is hypnotized and the reader is forced to wade through pages of probing by the psychologist/hypnotist as he tries to unlock her repressed memories(Skimming is recommended). Margolin introduces too many characters but he ties them together wonderfully in the end.  As we come back to the present Margolin delivers and ending that hit me like a kick in the belly. Very powerful. I did not see it coming.<br /><br />All in all - good job!	2005-02-25

Is there a connection? Will she solve the mystery?<br /><br />This abridged book on tape was ocassionally a little too abridged, but it was not too hard to follow. The reader was Megan Gallagher (the wife on the dark thriller TV show \\"Millenium\\"). Gallagher's voice is excellent for exuding (practically oozing) sympathy. This is wonderfully appropriate for some of the scenes, especially when there are deaths in the hospital. At other times, she turns on this \\"sympathy voice\\" on odd ocassions. At one point, she sounded like she was going to cry as the character baked a casserole!<br /><br />So, in short - not an original over-arching plot, but there were several good thriller scenes and the sub-plot concerning Dr. Harper's mom was a nice touch to the story. Gallagher's excessive sentimentalizing as she read was both a plus and a minus so we'll call that a draw.	2005-02-19

She is not haunted by dark shadows. She is not alienated from religion, her family and her fellow man.  She does not drink, she is not a \\"rogue cop on the edge.\\" And, guess what? She gets the job done.<br /><br />The story itself is fairly intricate and well-done. I feel that I really cannot even get into the any of the motivations of the bad guys for fear that I will inadvertently tip off the reader to larger plot issues. So, let's leave it at this is a pretty good story.<br /><br />On another note, I was intrigued that the main character (Deb Ralston) is a Mormon. Although, I am not a Mormon it did strike me as odd that this is the first Mormon I've ran across as a main character in a book that I can remember. I wonder why?

Fischer's book on the life and works of Luther is obviously intended to be a school-age biography of the great leader of the Reformation. I would suggest it for Middle or High School age students. It has several simple pencil illustrations spaced throughout the book that neither add nor detract from the text as a whole. This would also be an appropriate book for anyone new to Martin Luther or the Reformation.<br /><br />Fischer starts by setting the scene for the reader. His description of life and politics in pre-Reformation is Europe is one of the best short summaries that this world history teacher has ever read. Fischer sets the scene wonderfully for the reader to understand Martin Luther and the magnitude of his demands for the Church to reform itself.<br /><br />Fischer takes great care not to cast the Catholics as devils and Luther as an angel. All of Luther's warts are exposed (anti-semitism, etc.), but Fischer lingers longest on Luther's positive achievements and qualities. This is appropriate since those are the things that have had such a large influence on Western history.<br /><br />Fischer includes lots of quotes from Luther and his contemporaries, letting them speak for themselves (and to his credit, Fischer doesn't overquote and just supply us with an endless string of long quotes, as some historians do).<br /><br />The last 30 pages of the book are quotes and comments on Luther's teaching and writing about a number of topics, including \\"The Lord's Supper\\", \\"The Christian and his neighbors\\" and comments about what Luther really wanted to do when he begin the Reformation movement.	2005-02-19

It was narrated by Bruce Harwood, who portrays the most 'normal' of the conspiracy-addicted threesome known as 'the Lone Gunmen' on the X-Files TV show. Harwood does a competent, but ultimately uninspiring job of narrating the story. In fact, this is also a decent description of the book as a whole. It is okay, but not great. The characters act like they are supposed to, but those wry comments from Fox are mostly non-existent and Scully is just not quite right throughout most of the book.<br /><br />I am sure that the abridgment is at least partially to blame. The unabridged version is 8 and 1/2 hours. This one clocks in at three hours. Something had to give and it sounds like this one gave away its personality.<br /><br />The plot itself was okay. The ending was a bit anti-climatic.<br /><br />It's entertaining, but not great entertainment.	2005-02-16

Synopsis:<br /><br />This is part of a series of novels about Howard Moon Deer, a highly-educated Souix Indian who is living in Northern Arizona and helping Jack Wilbur, a blind ex-police chief from San Francisco run a detective agency near the Pueblo Indians. By th way, Howard Moon Deer knows absolutely nothing about being a detective. They run across a couple of murders involving the Pueblos and an ancient Anasazi town and human remains that may have the key to their disappearance centuries ago. The title refers to the Navajo's name for the Anasazi.<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />Sound gimmicky? Sound like a bad detective show like Jake and the Fat Man or Remington Steele? Sure it does, but it still works. Mostly it works because Howard Moon Deer is as much of a fish out of water as the reader is. Although he is a Native American the Souix are not like the Arizona Indians at all - plus, he has pretty much abandoned his Indian ancestry in search of a doctorate in literature. So, the characters are interesting, the books stand alone very well since this is my first one but it is the third in the series. The anthropology of the Anasazi and the Pueblos made the book very interesting for me.<br /><br />I give this book an \\"A-\\"	2005-02-12

It started out well but I soon got very tired of all of the legal wrangling. It just got irritating to me and it made me very glad that I did not become an attorney. This book's genre was legal \\"thriller\\" but I was tempted just to skip to the end in order to see who got the money and leave all of the tedium behind.

It was one of only a very few of their premier ships - designed before the Soviet collapse and completed by the Russian government. It was larger than anything in the American fleet.<br /><br />In August of 2000 there was an accident caused by a malfunction in a poorly maintained dummy torpedo during a war games exercise near the Arctic circle. The explosion of the dummy caused the explosion of every non-nuclear piece of ordinance on the sub and it immediately sink to the floor of the ocean 370 feet down. Most of the sailors died right away but about 20 survived in the aft compartments for several days.<br /><br />The book details the poor quality of Russia's underwater rescue teams (their annual budget for 1999 was $14,000 - their leaders joked about using it to buy a car so they could drive to an underwater rescue site) and their unwillingness to accept Western offers to help until it was too late for their sailors. It also details the trevails of some of the victims' families and the Russian government's clumsy responses to the crisis and their own newly-freed press.<br /><br />The book's title comes from a poem written by one of the men from the aft compartment. He gave it to his wife just before he left to participate in the war games.<br /><br />When there is A Time to Die<br /><br />Although I try not to think about this,<br /><br />I would like time to say:<br /><br />My darling I Love You.<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />This is a fascinating, yet depressing book. I learned a lot about submarines and underwater rescue but it involved the loss of over 120 men. The look into the new Russia and Vladimir Putin's first crisis as President is worth reading the book in and of itself.	2005-02-12

A special task force is set up to catch the mysterious killer and Lt. John Vinda, a tainted cop is placed in charge of the investigation (partially because he's that good and partially because he will be easy to pin the blame on since he is already damaged goods)<br /><br />This was an enjoyable read, but it was kind of like eating a handful of candy - it was fun while it was going down but there wasn't much to it. There was an interesting twist to the manhunt in that the cop and the serial killer have both suffered similar losses. It is interesting to see how the serial killer has warped himself into a monster while Vinda has buried himself in his job to avoid his pain. In reality, he's not dealing with his loss that much better than the killer.<br /><br />Caunitz is a retired NYPD detective so the language and scenes ring true and it is fun to watch the chase unfold.

The title of this book pretty much tells it all - it is an academic exploration into the people who deny the Holocaust ever happened and their motivations for making this claim.<br /><br />Of course, you may be wondering why someone would make a claim like this, despite the film footage of newly-liberated camps, eyewitness testimony from both victims and perpetrators, the population records that show that, indeed, some 6 million Jews did not survive World War II and damning circumstantial evidence from Hitler and members of his inner circle that alludes to a \\"Final Solution\\" to the \\"Jewish problem\\".<br /><br />Well, the deniers are a motley lot, some are educated and wel-spoken and others are not. Some feel that Germany has become a martyred nation to the cause of eradicating racism. Others are pro-fascist in politics and want to get rid of the taint that Nazi-ism gives to fascism, so they try to exonerate the Nazis.<br /><br />Others are just plain anti-semites and sincerely believe the Jews somehow \\"cooked up\\" the population figures or even somehow managed to conspire to kill off 6 milion of their own people in order to create sympathy for the creation of a Jewish country, namely, modern-day Israel.<br /><br />It was a fascinating book, a little deep at the beginning and the end with the different theories on how to approach history, but the middle was quite informative.

Among these are what Flynn calles &#34;The Five Big Lies&#34;. They are:<br /><br />1. American women live under a patriarchy.<br /><br />2. America is the World's leading threat to the environment.<br /><br />3. America is a racist nation.<br /><br />4. The US is an imperial power.<br /><br />5. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.<br /><br />Flynn quotes his opponents extensively and then rebuts their arguments with his own extensive research from a wide variery of sources (he has over 500 end-notes, often with commentary - not a small task).<br /><br />Flynn does not claim that the US is perfect in any of the above 5 areas. Far from it. He just submits that some on the left have given themselves over to hyperbole and unfairly characterized America and Americans.<br /><br />Who is the Left that he is disputing - not any of the normal run-of-the-mill politicians in the Democratic Party (the one that is the &#34;left&#34; in normal political terms for those political novices out there), but rather the ultra-left, such as Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Ted Turner, Stokely Carmichael, Cornel West, Patricia Ireland to name a few. I was put in mind of an ultra-feminist that taught my English W121 class at Indiana University. The poetry and essays and short story assignments were all about sexism and racism. I was told to write what I thought, but the only time I got above a &#34;C&#34; was when I wrote what she thought.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a quick and thought-provoking read that has the added bonus of being very enjoyable to read.	2005-02-12

Rather than drinking when depressed over the progress their making, he eats cold sandwiches made of leftovers over the kitchen sink, which irritates his wife to no end.<br /><br />An interesting theme is developed - Delaney asserts that truly beautiful women (in this case the wife - literally everyone comments about her striking looks ) often are (self-)limited in other capacities because they can get by with just their looks. For example, they don't have to develop specialized skills or learn to how to get along with difficult people or situations because everyone caters to them.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll give this book a \\"C+\\" The detectives and their different styles were interesting, but I had pretty much figured out who did it about half way through.	2005-02-12

As the title implies, this is a collection of biographcial essays on each of the 10 presidents from FDR to Bush 1 by 10 different authors who are either expert historians or knew the President while in office. The thing that ties them all together is that each essay is supposed to look at each man as president and find that one part of his character that made him the type of president he was. Each essay is about 30 pages and it makes for interesting reading.<br /><br />A good sample would come from Doris Kearns Goodwin's look at Franklin Roosevelt. She asserts that the most valuable component of his personality was his self-confidence. I thought this quote from FDR makes the point wonderfully: \\"I'll tell you...at night when I lay my head on my pilow, and it is often pretty late, and I think of the things that have come before me during the day and the decisions that I have made, I say to myself - well, I have done the best that I could, and turn over and go to sleep.\\"<br /><br />The essays are wonderful - some inspiring, such as Gerald Ford's, some disturbing such as JFK's.

I give this book an enthusiastic \\"A\\".	2005-02-12

This is the seventh in a series of novels featuring Lucas Davenport, a tough police detective in Minnesota. It is the third and definitely the best that I have read in the series.<br /><br />Davenport is more than a detective, he also designs role-playing and computer simulation games, a hobby that blossomed into a multi-million dollar business. The twist in this plot is that the bad guy is a psycho who happens to love role-playing games. He kidnaps one of his former therapists to fulfill some of his twisted fantasies and then gets a bigger thrill when he discovers that the designer of some his favorite games is on the case. (Imagine a 'Dungeons and Dragons' player matching wits against Gary Gygax and you've got the scenario)<br /><br />This is really quite a good thriller - it was very difficult to put the book down while reading the last 75 pages.	2005-02-12

This is a pretty good history of the Civil War. It has good pictures and an easy to read narrative of the war. It also has a lengthy appendix that includes many of the relevant historical documents, such as the Constitutions of the USA and the Confederacy, Lincoln and Jefferson's inaugural addresses, the Gettysburg Address, short biographies of the major personalities of the era and battlefield maps.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter, there is a lengthy section of quotes from participants and commentators of the day. This interesting addition makes the narrative read much quicker, but allows the reader to look at the topic in more detail if he/she chooses.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some errors in the book due to poor editing. Two, in particular, bugged me. I used this book to look for info on the battle of Gettysyburg and I was unable to find it. Its in there, but the chapter it is included in is mistitled. It is entitled: \\"Closing the Ring: The East: November 1863-March 1865.\\" It should be November 1862. My difficulties arose from the date of the Gettysburg Battle which is included in this chapter - July 1863.<br /><br />The second error came when the Grant's forces in Kentucky were called the Eastern army, rather than Northern or Union. Some might say, but were they Easterners in a Union army in Kentucky? No, they were mostly from Illinois - out West in the 1860s.<br /><br />So, I will keep this book as a reference, due to its fantastic appendices, but I will lower its grade due to sloppy editing. Grade: \\"B\\"	2005-02-12

It starts the reader with some of the early atrocities and misunderstandings that have characterized Indian and White interactions throughout American history. Some are the same things you will read about in any decent high school history text, and some are new for those that are not Indian history \\"buffs\\", such as myself. For example, I was not aware of the cruel and deliberate destruction of the Indian populations in California during the Gold Rush of 1849 until I read about it here.<br /><br />The book discusses Indian participation on both sides of the war and their various motivations for joining in the fight. These motivations range from genuine patriotism to wanting to suck up to the government (be it Union or Confederate) for favors to wanting a steady, if small income to just wanting to get involved in the biggest thing that was going to happen to this generation of Americans.<br /><br />Among the more interesting vignettes are the story of how the Eastern Band of the Cherokees (if you have been to the Smoky Mountain Nat'l Park you've heard of them) earned their land through service to the CSA, the biography of Colonel Ely Parker, the Indian who drafted Lee's surrender for his friend U.S. Grant and the Battle of the Crater. This Battle in the Petersburg siege had 3 different groups of Indians fighting (one on the side of the CSA, two on the USA) along with Blacks and Whites. It was probably the most integrated battle the U.S. fought until the Korean War, when Truman desegegrated the armed forces.<br /><br />This is one of the most heavily referenced books I've ever read. There are 53 pages of end notes and 42 pages of bibliography for a 192 page book! If you are ever looking for a great source of information for a paper or research project on the Civil War, I'd recommend starting with this list.<br /><br />Final Grade: B+ (good writing style, ocassionally too in-depth and bordering on trivia)B+ (good writing style, ocassionally too in-depth and bordering on trivia) <br />	2005-02-12

This is part of a series of books written about an ex-New Orleans cop named Dave Robicheaux nd his trials and tribulations. This book continues some of the same themes that characterize the series as a whole, such as racism, race relations, the difficulties of being a cop while also being father and husband.<br /><br />I love the setting and the details Burke puts in his books about New Orleans and the whole Bayou scene. He shows us the seemy side of New Orleans (which is not too hard to do - if you've ever been there you know what I mean. Not that every other city is problem-free, its just that New Orleans seemy side is very public - hey, its one of the attractions). Burke has a great ear for accents, and this makes parts of his books fun to read. However, his books can be depressing. No one rides off happily in the sunset..<br /><br />This particular book concerns a white man jailed in the 1990s for the murder of an NAACP leader in the 1960s. He claims he did not do it, but the man running for governor made his reputation proving he did. Dave R. happens to know both men and gets dragged into the controversy against his better judgement...<br /><br />Grade: C - great atmosphere, unnecessary plot twists.	2005-02-12

I enjoyed his PBS show. I listen to him on the radio when I can (WLS in Chicago). But, his books are not nearly as good as I know they can be!<br /><br />This book deals with his \\"Mama\\", a woman who took him in when he was a baby and his mother was neglecting him. She was not a blood relative, just a woman who saw a baby starving to death due to neglect. He lived with her until her death when he was 12. This book is an attempt on his part to honor her and the simple wisdom she taught him. The Seven Core Values are:<br /><br />1. Reality: The Value of Being Yourself.<br /><br />2. Knowledge: The Value of understanding your purpose<br /><br />3. Race: The Value of honoring your humanity (In this case, the only race his Mama was worried about was worried about was the human race)<br /><br />4. History: The value of investing in the future<br /><br />5. Truth: the value of being true to yourself<br /><br />6. Patience: the value of \\"Keeping the faith\\"<br /><br />7. Love: the value of living joyfully.<br /><br />As in his other book, Brown repeats himself a lot. He quotes a passage from Hamlet 3 times (part of the \\"to thine ownself be true\\" speech) as part of his multiple descriptions of his high school English teacher. He lifts two pages from his other book concerning a story about a YMCA opening in his hometown. He says the same thing, over and over, repitiously, a lot. He repeats himself. Yes, indeed, he seems to say something and then say it again. Repititive, he is.<br /><br />Like his last book ('Black Lies, White Lies), this book is in serious need of an editor. He seems to have written the chapters seperately, without regard to what he had previously written. I like the sentiments and ideas expressed, but, man, it was sometimes tiring to read them.	2005-02-12

See, what it is is that I have a friend who knows I am a NASCAR fan so he didn't know what else to get me for Christmas so he got me 3 NASCAR books. One of them was this one and I was fairly disappointed, mostly due to the fact that the title does not accurately describe the book.<br /><br />See, Daytona Speedweeks is a racing happening. There are a dozen motorsports events, culminating in the Daytona 500. There's a European-style 24 hour race, a motocross event and literally a half-dozen NASCAR races. Check their website!<br /><br />This book, however, focuses primarily on the Daytona 500 (90%) and barely mentions the other non-NASCAR events. In fact, some events it doesn't mention at all. I have no problem with the NASCAR focus, just give the book a different title. This, truly, is a book that you cannot judge by its title.<br /><br />I give this book a \\"D\\". The title thing annoyed me but there was nothing here about the history of the speedway or of the race.	2005-02-12
US	18800155	RHNQQC4SH8MP6	0816151539	489273526	The Woman in the Cloak	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fascinating	This book is a novelization of an actual historical figure, St. Margaret of Castelo. She was born a blind, hunchbacked dwarf with a withered leg. Despite these infirmities, and the rejection by her parents, she never feels cursed by God. Rather, she spends most of her relatively short life helping the poor of the small city of Castello. She lives with the beggars and the working poor, offering her help as a midwife, a free nanny and someone who is willing to go beg for food for the destitute.<br /><br />Margaret joins an order of Nuns, but they are not very serious about their vows and she is soon expelled as a troublemaker. So, she joins the Order of Penance of St. Dominic, a mostly male Order. There, she returns to her work on the streets. Eventually, her health fails her and she dies of a hacking, bloody cough.<br /><br />Up to this point, I found this story interesting and moving - here's a lady with the deck stacked against her in so many ways but she still finds a way to help others and give her life great purpose. However, the book veers into a part of Catholic theology that I am very uncomfortable with (probably due to a lack of proper understanding on my part) which is the act of praying to saints for healing. Margaret's bones become a sort of holy icon - pray to it or touch it and you'll be healed.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is an interesting read. I'll knock down the grade a bit for stilted conversation. The change in spelling in Margaret's name (Margheret to Margaret) without any explanation is also troubling.	2005-02-12

What I got was a romance novel about 3 men's boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice.<br /><br />The book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy. In addition, I was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the Israeli point of view (undoubtedly since I was hoping for the more-inclusive Michener-type approach).

This novel features veteran Montana state trooper Beau MacAllister, a wise-cracking good ol' boy who has great instincts and is not too concerned with protocal. Beau is called to a truck stop to stop a robbery in progress - but the whole thing seems fishy to him and he ends up shooting the supposed victim in the butt during a 3 way fight between Beau, the \\"victim\\" and several Indians using compound bows. Beau suspects something is amiss and tugs on this loose thread until he finds the conspiracy.<br /><br />The characters in this story are well-written - Beau is particulrly well developed, especially for a cop novel. The DA character (Vanessa Ballard) is quite memorable and \\"feels\\" like a real person, rather than a caricature. Even McAllister's nemesis, Dwight Hogelan, shows signs of growth during the book.<br /><br />All of this makes the end of the book very disappointing. The first 90% of the book is a great cop thriller - but the end is very hoaky and formulaic. It is like he finished the book under pressure and ran out of time. For example, he was maneuvering an Indian character into becoming a second Crazy Horse destined to lead a spiritual revival of the Plains Indians. However, 50 pages of character development was quickly dismissed in one page at the end. Why bother?<br /><br />Due to the disappointing end of this novel I have to lower the rating for this book from 5 stars to 3 stars.	2005-02-12

It makes for a herky-jerky read and is ultimately unsatisfying. That is why I am giving it a \\"2 stars\\".	2005-02-12

Much trouble ensues.<br /><br />The female lead is a little too well-connected (she always knows just the right person to help her when she needs something) and I was kind of bugged that the characters used dollars and pounds interchangeably in their financial wheelings and dealings.

Four members of this group are extremely successful (Congressman, Olympic medal winner, Big-time college basketball coach, billionaire entrepeneur) and the FBI believes the unsuccessful one is killing his former buddies in a fit of jealous, psychotic cold-blooded, calculating rage.<br /><br />The story mostly concerns the last two surviving friends (coach and billionaire) and the extraordinary steps the FBI takes to protect them while the coach's team is progressing through the  NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament field. If you like basketball, then the well-described basketball action is a nice addition to the mystery.<br /><br />Most of the action is set in and around the fictional University of Northern Indiana, which is located in West Lafayette, Indiana. For those familiar with Indiana, you know that that is the home for Purdue University. I have no idea why he didn't make the coach character Purdue's coach, especially when he refers to former Purdue standout Glenn Robinson in one of the scenes.<br /><br />The story works pretty well, although at times the conversations get a bit repetitive and the romance blossoms from nothing into a tight bond way too quickly. But, as a mystery goes, it was above average. I was fooled until I was supposed to know the truth, although I think the author tells us too soon - he could've kept the truth hidden a bit longer and made the story that much better.	2005-02-10

A jinglebob is the little spinny thing on the back of a set of spurs - the sharp part.<br /><br />The main character is the jinglebob man because he is imprisoned tortured by a sadistic superior officer with a set of sharpened spurs during the Civil War because he is accused of treason.<br /><br />Our protagonist, Tyler Carradine, escapes from his prison and is now forever on the run, afraid of meeting someone from his past and in pain due to a lost love that he feels will not accept him due to his physical deformities and the accusations against him.<br /><br />Carradine stumbles into a corrupt mining town years after the war and is finally forced to turn and fight rather than continue to run. Oh, and he finally has a chance to find love again (but not with his long-lost love).<br /><br />The plot of the book is pretty basic western fare. Kammen's writing style is uneven.

It was quite enjoyable to hear the four of these men work together - they were all quite good, especially Kristofferson and Nelson. This audio edition has features that most don't, including special effects and a music soundtrack that was sometimes reminescent of Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti Westerns and sometimes reminescent of \\"Silverado.\\" The inclusion of the special effects did speed the plot along (you don't have to describe that people are knocking on the door or riding horses, etc.) but sometimes they are distracting (one scene in particular had an overly loud clock ticking over the top of everyone's voices).	2005-01-26

First things first - if you are at all familiar with the American economy, you'll have to suspend your sense of disbelief throughout the book. The premise has American terrorists bombing Wall Street and stealing 2 billion dollars worth of stock certificates in order to destroy the American economy and take down the entire free market system throughout the world. Now, it takes place in the 80s but still, even in the 80s, 2 billion dollars was just a drop in the bucket. It wouldn't make a bit of difference, especially since it was spread out over 20-30 giant conglomerates.<br /><br />What makes the story work is the appealing main character, Arch Carrol.

However, I am awed that someone would even think to put the holocaust into comic form and then actually be able to pull it off.<br /><br />I bought these books based on pure reptutation and I admit that they were not what I had envisioned. Although the title tells you that it is a \\"Survivor's Tale\\", I envisioned a more comprehensive view of the war and the death camps. Instead, the reader is drawn into a much more intimate world - we follow Speigelman's father as he maneuvers through the war-torn Poland and finally the death camps.<br /><br />This is not a glossed over history. Spiegelman's father is not a saint - not during the war and not after the war. However, it makes the story all the more powerful, especially when his father's racist attitudes towards blacks in America. It drives home the point that the death camps were not a German problem, but rather a human problem. Books like 'Maus' are one of the best ways to remind all people that the potential is within all nationalities to commit the kinds of atrocities that the world witnessed in World War II and to guard against them.<br /><br />Don't let the comic format fool you - this is powerful stuff delivered with a punch. Well done.	2005-01-02

If, like me, you have been disappointed by the Jessie Stone series, this book will be a pleasant surprise. Up to this point, Jessie has been an underdeveloped character - his books have seem to have been back-burner material and second-rate effort by Parker.<br /><br />This one is different - and it is not a Spenser clone (like Sunny Randall)! Stone is working on two crimes at the same time and Parker paces them well so that the first crime (a rape at a local high school) comes to a resolution just as the second crime (a set of serial murders) finally starts to get interesting. No giant car chases or dramatic speeches as this book winds down, but it is satisfying nonetheless.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is Parker's insistence on having dysfunctional romantic relationships dominate Stone's personal life (we love each other but we just can't marry each other because that would stifle us, but we are faithful to one another just like we were married, blah, blah, blah...). This is just like he has done with Spenser, Sunny Randall and Phillip Marlowe. Geez, give it a rest!	2004-12-29

This sometimes sad, sometimes slapstick novel was an absolute joy to read. Was the ending a bit too 'Hollywood?' Sure - what else would you expect out of this L.A. story?<br /><br />Other reviewers have expressed concern over the perceived 'anti-church' bias in the book. While I am not a Catholic, I am a devout Christian and I had no problem with the jabs and pokes at the Church bureaucracy. Every denomination and organization has people that forget what the goal is and are more concerned with maintaining power and status and control than with the mission. I have no problem with anyone gently reminding (or in this case, not-so-gently reminding) everyone to keep themselves focused.	2004-12-29

Is it as good as vintage Hillerman? no<br /><br />Is it an improvement on 'The Sinister Pig?'  Absolutely<br /><br />Is it good enough? yes<br /><br />Is it enough just to read a bit more about the characters we've all come to know and love? maybe<br /><br />If you are a sports fan, than you've seen the point where the aging star athlete is just not playing up to his standards anymore.  Unfortunately, one can make the same analogy with Tony Hillerman. Is this novel as good as his novels used to be? As a whole, no. But, at times, it is just as good.  The rich cultural detail that used to permeate Hillerman's work is just not there anymore, and it makes the work that much poorer.<br /><br />To go back to the sports analogy, Hillerman is no longer the superstar that he once was. Can he still write? Absolutely, but the level has been reduced to that of the average writer.  Don't get me wrong, I'll snap up the next one as quick as it comes out but I won't be expecting as much the next time around.	2004-12-29

Westerns aren't normally my genre, but I've read quite a few in my day. This one broke the standard western mold (widow or farmer's daughter needs help to save family farm/ranch from unscrupulous banker/richer rancher and handsome stranger comes in to help her save the day - Tom Selleck's movie Crossfire Trail fits this mold perfectly!).<br /><br />This was a whole different kind of western, including a cross-country trek in search of a missing lover and the quest of a young sodbuster to become a cowboy. I appreciated the change of pace but the character development was spotty. For example, I felt like I knew the boy, but why did he hate farming so much? He seemed to apprectiate the fact that his father was a monstrous jerk but he never seemed to seperate the profession from the man.<br /><br />I liked the ending. I think it fits the boy pretty well - he may have hated farming but he hated losing the farm more.<br /><br />So, to sum up, it was a refreshingly different western, but its flaws do not allow me to do more than merely recommend it - thus the rating of 3 stars.	2004-12-18

It was abridged, as many are. Most are ably abridged - the listener does not even know that he or she is missing anything. In this case, it seems obvious that this one was rather clumsily abridged. For example, the listener does not know that Brynne and his wife are having marital troubles until 3/4 of the way through the book when she is unexpectedly cruel to him. The reason's for Kameron's insanity are edited out (I had to find out why in one of the reviews on this site) and most of the evidence for these plagues that is presented to the listener is so skimpy that you begin to wonder why anyone would even listen to Brynne and how he could even relate them to one another.<br /><br />So, on to the premise of the book itself. A madman wants to re-create all of the plagues visited upon Egypt in the Old Testament. Lame. What is this - a Batman re-run? \\"Holy fever blisters, Batman! The Joker's re-creating the plagues and next week he's going to make an evil 12 Days of Christmas!\\" To be honest, I got this tape just to break up the monotony of the road. I hoped it would be better than it sounded and it was actually worse.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars because John Shea ('Lex Luthor' on the now-cancelled Superman show 'Lois and Clark') did an absolutely fabulous job of reading it.	2004-12-18

This volume serves nicely as an introductions to General McClellan and his role in re-building the shattered Union Army after the First Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1861. It does a great job of describing the build-up to McClellan's Peninsular Campaign, which was his attempt to do a waterborne end run around the Confederate Army that was guarding Richmond, the Confederate capital.<br /><br />However, I feel that it is mistitled because it only covers the first half of the Peninsular Campaign. The text stops when Lee takes over for the injured Joe Johnston so we read nothing about the conclusion of the Peninsular campaign, including a majority of the battles.<br /><br />The book is beautifully illustrated and well-written. A novice to the Civil War will learn a lot, but even this old dog learned a couple of new things with this one.	2004-12-14

This is my first Fitzhugh novel and it won't be my last.<br /><br />I was expecting a murder mystery. It sure starts out that way with the gruesome poisoning death of a pick-up driving Cajun in Louisiana. But, the scene swiftly changes to an up-and-coming country music sensation and an up-and-coming writer and his beautiful radio station DJ girlfriend. Then, we're introduced to a couple of nearly down and out Nashville record producers and talent agents, Big Bill Herron and Franklin Peavey. The scene shifts to the crazy machinations of the Nashville recording industry (and the endless awards ceremonies -they are mentioned in passing, but new awards ceremonies with ever-more whacky titles and awards come up nearly<br /><br />every chapter).<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, amidst the glitz and confusion the original murder mystery re-surfaces, amdist another murder plot and criminal record deals.<br /><br />Old grudges mix with new ones and after finishing this book this reader was left wondering how any of his favorite musicians in the real world live a halfway 'normal' life!<br /><br />Fitzhugh's strength is building interesting characters. Some are developed very well and others are intentionally left as shadowy and mysterious. All are well done. The book was a hoot!	2004-12-13

Having never read a Marlowe book, I can't imagine that Parker kept his writing very true to the spirit of Marlowe.

Unfortunately, it seems like the editors did all the paring down with an battle axe rather than a scalpel. They butchered this book. Characters were in one scene than being referred to as dead - all in a blink of an eye. It's too bad that more details weren't included since this death was intended to be a clue pointing the reader to the killer. Scenes were jumbled around and the whole thing came off as rather poorly done.<br /><br />On a positive note, the reader of the book on tape was Anthony Heald (best known as the assistant principal on TV's Boston Public) and he was absolutely excellent. His voice characterizations were so great that it was easy to forget that there was only one narrator. If I could, I'd give Mr, Heald a score of \\"5 stars\\".	2004-12-04

This book, however, pleasantly surprised me.<br /><br />The plot is outrageous, but Dekker sells it pretty well. A Saudi princess escapes from her country and her family after hearing that she will be forced to marry an older, cruel man. She is unaware of the political considerations - and they are formidible. She encounters a certifiable genius in San Francisco in the person of Seth Borders and he saves her from being kidnapped back to Saudi Arabia.<br /><br />Borders and the princess go on the run. Borders is helped by unexplained glimpses at possible futures - a new phenomenon that he is learning how to manage as he is running. Borders is also troubled by the source of this phenomenon - is it natural or divine?<br /><br />The chase continues and it is a great read. Have no fear of picking this one up, lovers of Christian novels!	2004-11-23

My previous experience with Ken Follett was \\"The Third Twin\\", I book I was not too pleased with. So, when I pulled out this book on tape and saw, to my dismay, that it was by the same author I was expecting garbage.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.

There were laugh out load moments, such as when Agent Maddox busts through her potential boyfriend's door.<br /><br />Was the plot feasible? Doubtful.

Unfortunately, the main character was not very interesting - he really just served as the tool to allow the readers to view Roman society and engineering. It is also unclear as to why he develops his love interest and is so willing to risk his life for her when they've barely spoken to one another.<br /><br />Other reviewers have criticized Harris' treatment of Roman society in general, claiming that he sensationalizes the unseemly parts of Roman life, such as the brothels, the sex with children and the frequent representations of male genitalia in public places and in jewelry. I feel that he represented the spectacle that was Rome quite fairly. The Romans were master engineers, they had a society that allowed quite a bit of upward mobility, women had no rights to speak of, they were brave, and they were sexually explicit. Harris covers these aspects well. The reader would do well to remember that this is not a history of the Romans, it is merely a snapshot of the last 2 days of Pompeii.<br /><br />I think that Harris' depiction of the eruption was some of the best descriptive reading that I've had the pleasure to read for a while: the refugees, Pliny's vainly rushing out of port to try to save the library and refugees, the ash falling, the panic. Well done - it more than makes up for the weak character development in my mind and makes it five stars.	2004-11-22

I think it would have been much more believable if Sandford had made it a more Minneapolis-based character, such as the head of the Minnesota State Police.<br /><br />That being said, the gunfight scenes were well-done, especially the one in the hotel room in the dark.<br /><br />The reading was done by Ken Howard (the coach on CBS's \\"White Shadow\\") and he did a good job with voice characterizations and reading with the proper drama.

This is not your standard murder mystery - instead it reminds me of Larry McMurtry's \\"life is full of tragedy\\" theme. The greed of two men causes a chain reaction of events that end up with one of them being killed and life forever changed for a whole host of people.<br /><br />Is it a mystery? No - the reader knows exactly what happens and no one is looking for the real murderers. What it is is well-written and interesting and, ultimately it struck me as realistic.<br /><br />From what I've read of the other reviews, this was not MacDonald's standard fare - but I am still intrigued enough to look for some more.<br /><br />One thing I was terrible disappointed in - and this is not a reflection of MacDonald, but rather Fawcett Books, the publisher - there were massive amounts of typos in the book - sometimes at least one on every page for 15-20 pages at a stretch - misspellings, quotation marks left off, names not capitalized.

Instead, I got very shallow biographies of a handful of Roman Caesars and not very much helpful information. There was a lot of discussion along the line of \\"we don't know what illness he had since the symptoms are vague...\\" and not much solid fact to deal with. In fact, there is so much reference to how difficult it is to diagnose illness some 1600-2000 years later that I began to wonder why the book was even written. Only one or two of the biographies are at all useful. The maps are quite nice but one wonders why the author would include 10 pages of maps of the Roman world at the end of the book when he is discussing the health of Roman Caesars? The text of the book itself is just 90 pages long - the author has tacked on 84 pages of maps, geneological tables, biographies of every emperor mentioned already in the text (but these biographies just repeat the description in the text - nothing new is added), a picture of a bust of every emperor in the text, end-notes and an index. One presumes that this would be padding so that the publisher would not have insisted that the truly new and interesting imformation in the book would not have been distilled down to an interesting pamphlet on Rome.<br /><br />Grant also includes unnecessarily long quotations from source texts - and he seems to excell at lining up multiple quotes that say the exact same thing and once includes a quote from A. Birley that is, in itself, an almost exact quote from a previously quoted description from Marcus Aurelius of Commodus' health.<br /><br />Please, don't bother with this book.

Meltzer's character does the wrong thing but that is what makes the story so interesting.<br /><br />Meltzer's dialogue works so well with Thomas Gibson's performance that it sounds as if they were in the room copying down the natural flow of the characters' conversations as they were spoken. Truly, they were very fun to listen to.	2004-10-16

Some have tried too hard to be overly-complicated. Some have injected way too much romance, so much that you forget it was supposed to be a legal thriller with a bit of romance, not a romance with a bit of legal thriller. However, this story is a no-frills, just-the-facts-ma'am legal story - thank goodness!<br /><br />Now, this is not to say that it is not entertaining and the facts are not truly bizarre.<br /><br />Matera's book is set in California and involves a man who is arrested for vehicular manslaughter, but he claims he can't have done it since he was being probed by aliens in their spaceship at the time. Matera neither ridicules nor endorses the concept of alien abduction, much to her credit.<br /><br />The audiobook version was performed by Alexa Bauer and she did an absolutely wonderful job. Kudos all around!	2004-10-16

After an hour I gladly popped it out and listened to anything else!<br /><br />So, what's wrong?<br /><br />The characters are very, very, very flimsy - to say that they are wooden is to give them more credit than they deserve. They are flat and prone to bizarre mood swings and cursing fits that are totally inappropriate to the scenes.<br /><br />The book is about a prosecutor whose parents were killed by arson, apparently by one of her jilted boyfriends while she was in high school. He's picked up in a different city after all of these years but he somehow convinces jealous prosecutors that he's the real victim and that she killed them herself.<br /><br />Drama was supposed to occur at that point but instead we got more random anger and cursing. So, it got irritated and quit listening.<br /><br />Wow - this one is truly very bad.	2004-10-15

Set in 2069, the various colonies of the moon have revolted against the United Nations and declared their independence. The UN is not happy and responds by sending in peacekeepers to pacify things. A small, professional armed force augmented by volunteer militia fend off the UN and German forces (the world may be dominated by the UN but some individual countries still pursue their own agendas).<br /><br />This is a non-techno space romp. There's enough science to please most sci-fi fans but it as kept simple as we are introduced to the fighting styles of the future through the eyes of a computer geek militia member. The politics of the day are murky enough to seem plausible.<br /><br />I would have easily have rated this book a '4 stars' or, perhaps, even a '5 stars' if the ending had not been so terribly abrupt. Will there be a sequel. Did he just run out of time or space? Who knows, but it left a curious taste in my mouth.	2004-10-15

I think I've read them all and usually I am pleased. This one was a keeper.<br /><br />Oh, to be sure, there's the required comments about Spenser and Susan's relationship and why they don't want to get married. There's the required comments about Spenser and Hawk's relationship and how they'd die for each other, etc. There's the required comments about Spenser's checkered career in law enforcement. It's a formula to be sure, but I like the formula.<br /><br />Spenser's comments and observations are pure gold and the case was interesting because it (sort of) explains what happened to Enron.<br /><br />I guess I'm over the fact that Spenser never ages (Parker must have been hearing comments because he includes a NY Times review that excuses this fact inside the dust cover at the beginning of the synopsis) - it doesn't bother me with James Bond, why should it bother me with Spenser?	2004-10-15

That is too bad because the first 2/3 was well-written and informative.<br /><br />This really is an interesting book - one that should burst some bubbles of the anti-gun crowd. The writers painstakingly analyze the statistics and the motivations of some of America's biggest gun control lobbies, including the Centers for Disease Control (did you know that they use bogus data to label handguns as a public health threat? They quote FBI data that literally does not exist - they cite the document but it does not have the statistics that they use as a justification to lobby against guns. The document doesn't even report that type of statistic!)<br /><br />Don't let my comments about the last 1/3 of the book deter you from reading the rest of it - it really was worth the time and effort and firmly completed my swing from being anti-gun to being anti-gun control.	2004-10-15

One of my favorites. This story is easy to read, quick-moving and entertaining but, for me, ultimately it is disappointing because I know that he could do sooooooo much better. If you've never read Stuart Woods, read 'Chiefs' and maybe you'd be better off just walking away.<br /><br />So, why am I irritated? The characters are two-dimensional cutouts of what we might suspect the rich and the famous are really like. They reminded me of unpleasant parodies of the Howells from Gilligan's Island. Woods can do so much more.<br /><br />To be fair, I guess I'm really irritated to see a man who showed so much early promise resort to being a hack writer, pounding out the same story time after time. I tolerate, in fact, I revel in it when it comes to Robert Parker. But in the case of Stuart Woods - what an incredible waste of writing talent!	2004-10-14

Willy, pedophile and sadist. When he gets out of prison due to a technicality, she knows he'll come after her because she is the only one who knows the twisted way his mind actually works, despite his charming demeanor. We follow Stone as she tries to work through her out-of-whack personal life, some demanding clients and the omni-present threat of Willy. Interestingly, Willy is not fleshed out much as a character. This works well, in that Willy becomes more of an unknown threat to the reader - a man capable of anything - but we don't know where he is likely to come from or what he is likely to do.<br /><br />The book is surprisingly well-done, (I say surprising because a lot of thrillers featuring psychiatrists tend to get bogged down in jargon) and Stone is prickly but likable. Her world is peopled with interesting, but not terribly well-developed characters. This is a part of a series so I'd assume that the characters will be better developed as time goes on.<br /><br />If you follow the author's link at the top of the page you will find that Salter is well-qualified to write about the life of a therapist as has co-authored a number of books about recovering from rape and child abuse and trauma.<br /><br />All in all, a great little read.	2004-10-12

And, it first it did seem that this book was floundering and going to be another bust for Darden.<br /><br />However, what I mistook for floundering was actually the plot being carefully laid out - including intricate subplots, betrayals (lots of betrayals) and bizarre dead ends that mislead the reader to the very last page. When you finally get a handle on what the bad guys are up to you then wonder which guys are the bad guys, which are the good guys and who is just out for themselves.

Will the animal expert and the rough cop be able to save the day?<br /><br />Even though the plot is formulaic, I still found myself wanting to know what happened next. I couldn't wait to pop the tape in the player as soon as I got in the car!<br /><br />The book on tape is read by Boyd Gaines who does a phenomonal job.

I am reviewing this book as a book on tape and will make specific comments on that aspect of it at the end of this review.<br /><br />I have drudged and slogged my way through a number of books and books on tape lately and this one was like a bolt of lightning - it came out of nowhere and really was a welcome surprise for me. I won't go into the plot details, since they are readily available in the book description at the top of this page - however, this is a great bit of writing. The premise is thought-provoking, to say the least. In a nice twist, the antagonist is well-developed and the protagonists are not. The story is plot-driven and by that I mean we don't get bogged down in unnecessary details, such as focusing on weapons at great length, etc. - as can sometimes happen in a techno-thriller.<br /><br />Really a top notch piece of work.<br /><br />As for details concerning the book on tape - it is read by Campbell Scott (known for his work in 'Dying Young' and 'Dead Again'). He does a first-rate job - he reads the characters so differently that you really don't notice that the same man is reading all of the different parts.<br /><br />Good work all around.	2004-09-23

It can be used by people from all over the political landscape to define their goals and they are all using it correctly (I think he does this rather brilliantly in the chapter concerning anti-war protesters vs. George W. Bush.)<br /><br />The Publishers Weekly review correctly points out that Cannon's focus is, at times, lacking. However, the text is still informative and well-written. I would compare it to a pleasant conversation that strays a bit from its original focus but eventually does return.<br /><br />Cannon pulls quotes from a great multitude of sources and he correctly, in my mind, expounds on his thesis that one of the Great Themes of the American experience is expanding the concept of the \\"pursuit of happiness\\" and making it apply to more and more people within our own society and also throughout the world. His view that this is one of the goals of the invasion of Iraq is so consistent with Bush's own statements and my own observations that it shocked me to read it in print. Why was I shocked? I was shocked because this was the first time I read it in print - he is the first journalist I've seen to analyze it in this way and I feel that he is one of the few who actually has an intellectual grasp of what Bush's goals are in Iraq (be they successfully reached or not and Cannon really does not address the correctness or not of the war in Iraq - he is merely looking into motivations).<br /><br />His quotes from leaders of nations that were once part of the Soviet Bloc and are now part of the Coalition of the Willing in Iraq are so concise and insightful that I was struck dounbfounded in many ways.<br /><br />On a pet peeve note, Cannon has lots of endnotes - many with excellent additional commentary. I wish his publisher had seen fit to make them footnotes so that I would not have had to keep two bookmarks in the book and continually have to flip back and forth.ul that I was struck dounbfounded in many ways.

Just to let you know, I heard this book on tape, rather than having read it. I will discuss specific issues about the book on tape aspect of it at the end.<br /><br />This was a scary, sad thriller. Children are being abducted from their bedrooms across Seattle and, in reality, all across the country and Seattle's finest are out to stop the kidnappings. Obstacles in their path include very poor teamwork with the FBI and there's another kidnapping very close to home...but I won't spoil it for you by telling you who.<br /><br />Good police work ensues and it is satisfying to go along with the police as they slowly amass their clues and get closer and closer. Once the reader finds out the truth, there's still quite a bit of work to do to wrap it all up - including a cross-country chase.<br /><br />Its a good, good thriller and I would have given it 5 stars but I am reviewing the abridged book on tape and I have some complaints:<br /><br />1. The reader does great dialogue but is poor at reading non-dialogue - everything sounds breathless and over-hyped. Very William Shatner-esque, if you catch my meaning.<br /><br />2. The abridgement apparantly left out a part of the story concerning Idaho - it is barely referenced on the first tape and then the suspect has an injury on the face due to an accident suffered in Idaho that everyone seems to know about.<br /><br />3. The tape is strangely edited. For example, side one - tape one ends in the middle of a sentence. The sentence starts over again on side 2 but still...	2004-09-20

If you lived in Central Indiana from the mid-90s to 2003 you probably saw Barney - Dick Wolfsie's canine sidekick and faithful companion for literally thousands of segments of the WISH-TV morning show. He wasn't a prop or a gag (he was too poorly trained for that) - he was his own man (!) on the show. He was goodwill ambassador and class clown and all beagle.<br /><br />This is a light-hearted book - full of Wolfsie's wonderful memories - the good and the bad. Really, it's a fluff piece - but this piece of fluff caused my eyes to tear up  more than once as he spoke of the day his beloved Barney died and the immediate outpouring of love and concern that central Indiana expressed.<br /><br />Truly a wonderful little book - be prepared to laugh (my wife and I read parts of it to each other and enjoyed it all the more) but also have the tissues handy!	2004-09-14

I am reviewing this from the perspective of having heard it as a book-on-tape.<br /><br />Archy McNally, the self-proclaimed 'Bon vivant' narrates an odd story that is made all the more odd by his continual need to turn a clever expression - nearly in every sentence! It gets to the point where it is distracting! The characters are pretty two-dimensional. Some seem like they were stolen right out of a high school production of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" - stereotypes of what we might suspect the rich and famous might be like. Heck, the only rich guy I liked in the book was killed! (on the other hand, I liked the cop and the dog.)<br /><br />If it were not for the absolutely great voice work of Boyd Gaines it probably would not have been palatable for me.

The descriptions of the power of these weapons and the reasons that tin-pot dictators and superpowers possess them was informative.<br /><br />As always, Coonts writes wonderful action sequences. His characters are sometimes a bit stiff, especially with his American cabinet officials.<br /><br />Quibbles I have with the book:<br /><br />-Sometimes there's so much tech-speak that it bogs the story down. At times, Coonts seems more interested in showing us cool gadgets than moving the story along.<br /><br />-Why is Rear Admiral Jake Grafton personally leading the invasion of a Cuban prison and checking out abandoned freighters with Toad Tarkington? Why is Toad Tarkington leading military mission after military mission? These men are in their 50s! Are their no Junior officers in his entire carrier group? Very Captain Kirk-ish.

Ford	Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Ford and his Leo Waterman books but this was a great change of pace.<br /><br />Ford's new hero is Frank Corso - he's hard to get a read on, he's a loner (with friends), he's difficult (but is smooth when he interviews), he's trustworthy and, most importantly, he loves to put his nose into other people's business, especially when he smells a good story.<br /><br />Ford introduces a variety of characters to fill out Corso's world and I think it works very well. The pacing of the book is excellent and I oftentimes found myself having to force myself to put it down so I could go on with the rest of my day. This book is darker and more serious than the Waterman books, mostly because there isn't the  comic relief supplied by the homeless crowd from the neighborhood bar, the Zoo.<br /><br />For those fans of Leo Waterman, he makes a cameo appearance at the beginning.	2004-09-07

Don't look for the book to be much more than less-than-adequate grammar aid (the accompanying workbook is short on simple drill and big on fairly complicated \\"realia\\" type activities - those have their place but I would prefer some simple activities to start with - especially with topics like subjunctive).<br /><br />On a positive note, there are readings in the book that can be useful.	2004-09-06

Each story describes a different type of escape or incident - varying from the case of Solomon Northrup - a free black man who was drugged and sold into slavery while he was working in Washington, D.C. to John \\"Fed\\" Brown, a field slave who travelled a roundabout trip to freedom covering thousands of miles to John Price - an escaped slave who was captured in Ohio, but was eventually freed thanks to the near-riot of the Oberlin College community. The book ends up with the most famous member of the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman, and details a number of her exploits as a Conductor and as a Union Spy during the Civil War.<br /><br />As a reader, I appreciated the variety of types of escape stories - it did not get stale reading about the same type of escape and the variety of escape plans really was a wonderful testament to human creativity in the face of hardship.	2004-09-02

It also turns out that Indiana is the birthplace of Wonder Bread, Alka Seltzer, Corn Flakes, Pork and Beans and the unique shape of the Coca-Cola bottle. He includes driving directions that look to be accurate (I am familiar with some of these places) although a good map of Indiana would also be required to even find some of the towns that he mentions. He includes several pictures, which generally are helpful.<br /><br />This really could have been a charming little book - one that I would have been 100% enthused about except for the author's fascination with Dan Quayle (not in a positive way, either) and Jim Jones (the cult leader who led his 900+ followers in a mass suicide in Guyana in the 1978). Do we really need to see Dan Quayle's frat house? Do we really need to see a picture of the bridge that his Jones' uncle jumped off of in order to commit suicide?<br /><br />But, on the whole, the guide is useful and entertaining. It includes addresses, phone numbers, web addresses, visiting hours, costs (if any) and directions to every location he describes.

It just was not the type of book I expected.<br /><br />\\"Day of Wrath\\" is a military James Bond-esque type thriller with a large international plot that crosses continents and jurisdictions with lots of action. The odds are heavily against the good guys (of course) but they have pluck!...Anyway, you can see that it is sort of formulaic but it is still good. I think that it has a slow start but once the ball gets rolling it's worth the time to read it.	2004-08-26

Spenser novel, and I've probably read all of them. I've only been disappointed by one of them, and this one was a decent return to the form and content of the original dozen or so.<br /><br />The storyline goes like most of them - Spenser takes a hardluck case, finds very few clues but continues to poke around until someone reacts. He is a smart Private Investigator, but mostly he is very persistant and willing to stir up trouble. Lots of good one liners.	2004-08-22

Imagine that James Bond were no longer needed for Her Majesty's Secret Service so they decided to eliminate him so that he couldn't embarrass them later. This is sort of the premise of this book, except that Jud Stuart is not nearly as suave and debonair as Bond and he works for the American government.<br /><br />Stuart is a special forces soldier recruited by the CIA during the Vietnam war. He is involved in action in Laos, Iran, the USSR, Washington D.C. and Central America. Finally, he's had enough and decides to use his connections to smuggle drugs into the U.S. and pocket the cash for himself (and eventually becomes a marked man due to nebulous connections to the Iran-Contra scandal).<br /><br />The first 100 pages or so of this novel are confusing due to a large amount of flashbacks with little or no setup. Once all of the characters are established this is much more tolerable. The flashbacks themselves are very interesting since they involve Stuart's secret missions. The rest of the book, however, is not nearly so interesting.	2004-08-22

He is in charge of a small animal kingdom and is confronted by the evil Coctrice, a half snake/half rooster who is the son of the devil, an evil serpant that is trapped beneath the surface of the earth but is trying to get out to destroy God's creation. The book revolves around the efforts of the animals to come together to confront the evil threat and the costs that such action entails. It also has much deeper themes such as the nature of love and forgiveness.<br /><br />I really was not looking forward to reading this book - in fact, I only picked it out of my pile of books because I thought that I had remembered a friend had read it while we were in high school. Much to my surprise, however, I loved it. It was well-paced and the main characters had depth. I recommend this book enthusiastically.	2004-08-22

Grant<br />The Aristocrat: Robert E. Lee<br />The Knight-Errant: John Bell Hood<br />The Roman: George H. Thomas<br />The Cavalier: John B . Gordon<br />The Puritan: Francis C. Barlow<br /><br />Buell researched this book heavily, including delving into the National Archives to the point that he actually found boxes of papers from the Civil War that had not even been opened since they were packaged and delivered after the war, a fact that I find amazing given the vast number of books written on the war every year.<br /><br />Buell is quite clear in his book that Robert E. Lee was vastly overrated and quite possibly incompetent (he never says it outright but he infers it). I agree that Lee has been overrated by some, but his incompetence is refuted, in my mind, by his track record against a much larger, better equipped army over the course of the war. To his credit, Buell does not lay the blame for the vast number of casualties in the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsular Campaign on Lee - which I consider fair considering that he was forced to take charge during the battles due to the wounding of Confederate General Joseph Johnston. Lee can't really take the blame for a situation he did not create.<br /><br />Buell also is extremely critical of Grant, sometimes in a contradictory manner. At the beginning of the book he is critical of Grant's strategy as unimaginative at the end of the war (press Lee constantly, despite the constant casualties since Lee could not replace his casualties and Grant could easily replace his own - it quickly became a numbers game and denied Lee his famed mobility) and then, towards the end of the book he praises it.<br /><br />Buell's favorite is obviously Thomas, a brilliant organizer who built the army that literally simultaneously destroyed the Confederate Army of Tennessee (under Thomas) and was the core of Sherman's famous March to the Sea through Georgia. However, he was ultimately relieved of command by Grant for being too deliberate - a conclusion that I share with Grant. Buell, however, believes that it was an unjust firing. (Grant believed that action was often more important than preparation - sometimes true, sometimes not, but Thomas never seemed to be prepared enough...)<br /><br />Although I disagreed with many of his conclusions, I did enjoy Buell's book. It was informative and well written.sly destroyed the Confederate Army of Tennessee (under Thomas) and was the core of Sherman's famous March to the Sea through Georgia.

It also tells you how to win at certain games, the inside skinny on some of the major theme parks (did you know that DisneyWorld has an underground vacuum powered garbage removal - much like the system at your bank's drive through window - so that you don't have to see any garbage being hauled through the park?) and which food booths to avoid at your local fair (chicken & fish due to easy spoilage and the booths that sell more than 2 or 3 items - the specialists are just better).	2004-08-22

The United States is beset by a series of terrorist attacks on our power system and the nation's power grid collapses for several months. Anarchy ensues on the home front and on the international stage. The book follows several characters as they deal with the problems - some fairly simple, such as feeding family and friends without access to electricity and fuel for the tractors, some more complex, such as dealing with gangs and rednecks gone amuck and some world-shattering, such as Iraq trying its hand at nuclear brinksmanship.<br /><br />This is Garrison's first novel - and at times it shows. It is really quite long at 663 pages. It could have been easily edited down by 100 pages. The middle of the book is really pretty good, but both ends of it were clunky.	2004-08-22
US	18800155	R1UD0L4KCZFOFG	0451181336	630457617	Flintlock	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Good summer fun!	Flintlock is the frontier nickname of Nathaniel Jones, a deadeye shot on the Kentucky frontier. The book is ostensibly about Aaron Burr and his attempt to break the American West away from the rest of the United States in the early 1800s. For those of you not familiar with Burr, he was the former Vice President (Jefferson's first term) who killed America's first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton (he's on your $10 bill) in a duel. This ruined his political career and he was accused of conspiring to turn the US territory East of the Mississippi and west of the Appalachians into a personal dictatorship.<br /><br />The book has a rather large prologue (almost 1/2 of the book) that concerns young Flintlock's exploits as a teen in the Revolutionary War on the Virginia/Kentucky frontier. To be honest, that is the only complaint that I have with the book - its back cover does not accurately describe its contents. It's a fun summertime book, a quick read with lots of action and lots of historical background thrown in. Is it a great work of fiction, able to stand with Melville and Hemingway? No, but it is a fun little book that does all that it was ever intended to do - entertain a lot and educate a little.	2004-08-22

The premise here is that a group of people get stranded on an island in the Galapagos and end up becoming the sole survivors of the human race, due to war and famine. Their gene pool decides the fate of humanity biologically, which is why it is set in the Galapagos Islands (thank you, Charles Darwin).<br /><br />I could tell you the plot, but that would just gloss over all of the intentionally contradictory themes of the book (for instance: the importance of the individual is emphasized vis-a-vis evolution, but the individual is also not important because the individual is also swept away in several instances due to his stupidity and/or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time). There is actually some meat on the bones of this book - a nice change of pace when compared to some others I've read lately.<br /><br />P.S. for those Hoosiers out there - as you may know, Vonnegut is from Indianapolis. One of the characters went to IU (and survives! - probably due to conditioning from the dorm food) and the ships motors were made by a diesel company in Columbus, IN - sound familiar?	2004-08-22

His babysitter, a male high school senior is immediately suspected of molestation. The little boy is very bright but is certainly very vague about what happened to him. Psychologists are brought in, with their own agendas. The prosecutors, parents, judge and the victim all have their own agendas. The reader is left to try to guess what really happened.<br /><br />The point of view is usually that of the little boy who is trying to navigate his way through the adult court system while keeping his secrets secret, his famlily intact and do what is right, as far as he can tell. I really can't go into much more detail without spoiling the plot.<br /><br />This is Brown's first book. He is a state supreme court justice from Ohio and I hope that this disturbing piece of fiction was not based on a true case. This book was well-written, compelling and, like I've already said, disturbing.	2004-08-22

Usually, they opt for more glitz than substance and you end up with a pretty, but bland piece of history. However, this, I am very pleased to say, is a much better book than their usual effort.<br /><br />Although this is an illustrated history, the narrative that begins each chapter is very well written. The topics are interesting, especially the chapters on the abolitionists and the secessionists. They do an excellent job of setting the stage for the Civil War.<br /><br />I have but two complaints - one is serious and one is not. First, the unpleasentness. The text had at least one glaring factual error - they have the Battle of Gettysburg taking place in 1864 rather than 1863. Mistakes like this are easy to make (a stray finger on a keyboard...) but this is the most famous battle of the war! My second complaint is the sheer bulk of this tome - it weighs 5 pounds and is oversized. Yes, I weighed it. Its unwieldiness made it difficult for me to read in my \\"reading room\\" (if you get my meaning) due to the difficulty of balancing it on my knees. :)	2004-08-22

Lee's decision not to opt for guerrilla warfare but rather surrender and urge his men to become good citizens for their country (meaning the USA), Johnston's similar decision in North Carolina, the assassination of Lincoln, the uncertain rules of Presidential succession, the North's collective decision not to lash out blindly at a prostrate South in revenge for Lincoln's murder and a host of other issues.<br /><br />My take: Winik is one of that new breed of historian that knows that good writing as at least as important as good research (You can't teach anything if you write poorly). Winik's synopsis of the issues of slavery and the Wilderness campaign are so good that if I ever get the chance to teach US history again I am going to copy them and hand them out to my students.<br /><br />This book renewed my awe of Robert E. Lee as a man. Flawed, like all of us, he made the exact right decisions at the end. Perhaps the most interesting was in the summer of 1865 - the war was over and Lee was back in Richmond awaiting his fate. It is communion Sunday and a black man decided to assert his rights as a free man and he goes up to the alter FIRST to get communion (traditionally, blacks were last). The whole church stops. The minister is flustered at the change of social niceties. Lee gets up - goes up to the front and stands next to the man for Communion. Now, the service must go on- because you can't refuse Robert E. Lee. Together, the two men integrated the church - with no prior planning. Lee just knew that this was the way it had to be now, so get over it.<br /><br />Great book. I heartily recommend it.	2004-08-22

This is one great book.<br /><br />It is based on the true story of Francis Slocum, a 4 year old Quaker girl who was kidnapped by Delaware Indians in the 1770s on the Pennsylvania frontier near Wilkes-Barre. (There are recreation areas named for her in both Pennsylvania and Indiana)<br /><br />It is also the story of her family's 60 year search for her across the Midwest and even into Canada.<br /><br />It is also the story of the relentless American westward movement and how the Indians dealt with it.<br /><br />The reader also gets a fantastic lesson on daily life among the Delaware and Miami Indians.<br /><br />If you're a Star Trek: The Next Generation fan you'll remember the epidsode in which Picard is \\"attacked\\" by the alien probe from the long-dead world that makes him live an entire lifetime among their people in his mind in just a few seconds so that their way of life will never be forgotten. (It's the one where he learns to play the little flute-type instrument). Well, this book reminds me of that - you are drawn into this woman's life and initiated into Indian culture as she is. you learn along with her. You grow up with her, feel her disappointments and joys and her confusions as she learns that her white family is searching for her (should she seek them? should she run? Would it be best to take advantage of her white skin and abandon her Indian family as the times get harder and harder?)<br /><br />I have a few quibbles with the book but those are dwarfed by Thom's overall accomplishment. Honestly, at the end of the book, when Francis Slocum dies, I felt as though a longtime friend who'd lived a wonderful and fulfilling life had died - and that is the greatest compliment I think I can give it.<br /><br />Bravo!	2004-08-22

Ostensibly, the Intruder in the story is the homeless man who fixates on Jake Schiff and determines, through his crack-induced haze, that Jake Schiff has somehow stolen his family and his home. But, as you read you notice that there are actually lots of intruders. Jake Schiff is a Jewish lawyer from a rough Brooklyn neighborhood who doesn't quite fit in with his WASP law firm and their snooty ways. His wife is a social worker who is an intruder in her work world because she cares more about the clients than the bureaucracy. There's a mobster named Phillip who is an intruder in his world because he's hiding his homosexual feelings in the very, very macho world of the mafia. He's also an intruder in Jake's world as he forces Jake to deal violently with the homeless madman who has laid siege to his life.<br /><br />But, then again, maybe I'm reading symbolism in to places where it doesn't belong. What the heck, it's fun. This book is a good read and has enough plot twists to satisfy all but the most jaded of readers.	2004-08-22

A pretty good book, actually.<br /><br />The premise is that the United States was never formed. The British government dealt fairly with the colonies in the 1760s and the independence movement was stillborn. Instead, what are now the USA & Canada is called the North American Union and are an integral part of the United Kingdom. The UK is a vast world-wide empire led by the King-Emperor. This union is symbolized by the painting \\"The Two Georges\\" which depicts colonial representative George Washington bowing before King George III before an assembly of British and American dignataries. This moment encapsulates the agreements that kept the American colonies a part of the British Empire. At the beginning of the book the painting is stolen in 1996 by The Sons of Liberty, a North American pro-independence movement. The story follows two detectives and an art curator who are searching for the painting before the ransom deadline.<br /><br />There were a lot of fascinating things about this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the historical premise and the maps of the world and North America that are at the front of the book. The authors conclude that if there were no USA, there would be few independent countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas, since there was no American example to inspire the dismantling of the vast world-wide European empires. Germany never coalesces since France never spawns a Napoleonic Empire (Napoleon was the first to unite most of Germany - before that it never really ocurred to the Germans that they could create a powerful country if they untied themselves) since there was no French Revolution since there was no American Revolution to inspire it.<br /><br />American history is different since the UK outlaws slavery in the 1830s - there was no Civil War. The American map has 2 mostly American Indian states - Iroquois and Cherokee, thanks to British restrictions on white incursions over the Appalachians (one of the reasons for rebellion mentioned in the Declaration of Independence).<br /><br />Technology is far behind that of our world - American creativity is not challenged due to World Wars, Japan is practically a non-entity and Germany is a bunch of warring principalities.<br /><br />Enjoyable book, decent mystery, good adventure.e incursions over the Appalachians (one of the reasons for rebellion mentioned in the Declaration of Independence). <br /> <br />Technology is far behind that of our world - American creativity is not challenged due to World Wars, Japan is practically a non-entity and Germany is a bunch of warring principalities. <br /> <br />Enjoyable book, decent mystery, good adventure.	2004-08-22

I did not see it coming and that (and the accurate quote) deserves recognition.<br /><br />This book, however, only rates a \\"3 stars\\" from me - it did not stay true to the strong character development that was present in the other books and I thought Ben Kincaid strayed from the character that has been built throughout the rest of the books.<br /><br />I do, however, recommend any of his very early books.

Two bizarre things happen at the beginning of the novel to create disaster. Number 1: Science \\"discovers\\" walking plants that are named Triffids that can communicate among themselves. Our narrator, Bill Masen, believes that they are the result of Russian military testing, possibly meant to be a weapon, but they quickly spread all over the world. The Triffid is harmless enough until it grows to be man-sized. Then, it is able to walk by using its branches to swing its trunk, similar to the way a man on crutches walks. Once it walks, it is also able to hunt with this long whip-like tentacle with a poisoned tip. The Triffids like to eat putrid, rotting meat, much like a Venus Flytrap. It tears the meat loose with its tentacle.<br /><br />The Triffids are more of a curiosity to the world, though until bizarre thing #2 happens: There is a meteor shower one night - it is very bright and people all over the world watch it because it goes on all night. The next day, everyone who saw any part of the shower goes blind. Our narrator, however, is not blind because he had hospitalized for eye surgery and his eyes had been bandaged the night of the shower. Masen believes the meteor shower was not a natural ocurrence, but rather it was all a mistaken attack by an American or Russian satellite with a space-based radiation weapon.<br /><br />The rest of the book concerns Masen and his struggle to survive. Everything collapses when 95% of the population goes blind. The whole of England becomes a Mad Max environment and different types of communities are formed to attempt to deal with the blind survivors, the Triffids and the threat from other sighted survivors.<br /><br />All in all, its a good read and it holds up well, considering it is 50+ years old. Wyndham did a great job of prediciting the Cold War and the buildup of weapons and the push to harnass science for military applications. I would assume that this book had been read by the creators of Mad Max because they share a lot of the same images. However, don't get this book confused with the constant violence of the Road Warrior. Those scenes are rare, even if the settings are similar.

This is one of those humorous fantasy books, in which everything is sweetly parodied and lots of puns are thrown in, etc.<br /><br />A Prince in search of a princess finds a castle in which all of the inhabitants are asleep due to the spell of a fairy godmother (as in Disney's Sleeping Beauty), including the girl of his dreams. However, he needs to wake up 3 princes before he wakes up his love so he enlists the help of his tomboy cousin (a princess) and his boyhood friend, who happens to be a newly graduated wizard and they all go back to the castle for adventure, treasure and love. Along the way, Rumplestiltskin (yes, that one) gets invlolved.<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />This book was so irritating that I got to page 85 and called it quits. The author seems to be more bent on being cute than she is on advancing the story (which had gone nearly nowhere in the last 25-30 pages I did read). I was afraid that if I read it any longer, I would somehow be sucked in and trapped like the people in the castle. Maybe that would have been fine - at least I'd be asleep and not reading the book!	2004-08-22

The book is his collected memoirs which were written on numbered pieces of scrap paper. The future he lives in is dominated by the Japanese economy and the American foreign and domestic policies are consumed by \\"The War on Drugs.\\" Racism is much more prevalent.<br /><br />Eugene Debs Hartke was a teacher at Tarkington College, a college for very rich Special Education students who would not graduate from a traditional university. Across the lake is a maximum security prison that holds 10,000 prisoners - most of them were Special Education students who turned to crime to make a living.<br /><br />This is a good book, but it starts out a little slow. There are similar themes as other Vonnegut books I've read, especially his focus on how life's little choices can radically change what happens to you.<br /><br />Vonnegut is a master at coming up with quotable odd thoughts and here are a few that caught my eye:<br /><br />\\"In an era as foulmouthed as this one, (someone saying) 'Good gravy' had the same power to startle as a cannon shot.\\"<br /><br />On human space travel:<br />\\"How could all that meat, needing so much food and water and oxygen, and with bowel movements so enormous, expect to survive a trip of any distance whatsoever through the limitless void of outer space? It was a miracle that such ravenous and cumbersome giants could make a roundtrip for a 6-pack to the nearest grocery store.\\"<br /><br />\\"Another flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.\\"<br /><br />On Freedom of Speech:<br />\\"That isn't something that someone else gives you. That's something you have to give yourself.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, its a good book. I enjoyed it. It made you think sometimes and that is always good.	2004-08-22

This time, the story is about his twin brother, a cop and a presumed suicide who left a disturbing note consisting of a single line from Poe. McEvoy does a lot of digging and discovers that there have been a string of police suicides across the country with \\"Poe\\" suicide notes. Soon, he's on the case with an FBI task force and the chase is on to catch the killer they've nicknamed \\"The Poet.\\"<br /><br />This really is a well-written book. The first 100 pages are slow and wallowing in self-reflection and insecurity, as is appropriate for those left behind in the wake of a suicide. Once McEvoy finds the clues leading to a different conclusion, the book picks up in pace until it races along. The ending is full of cliffhangers and I was surprised.	2004-08-22

It has a very attractive cover. I hate the book. It is a legal mystery and I found that I did not care that the victim had been killed because he was immensely unlikeable, I did not care that any number of possible suspects had been falsely accused - they were unlikeable twits that deserved some trouble just for being so stupid. I did not like the lawyer (the main character) although I did like her mom.<br /><br />So, when the reader cares not about the murder, the victim or the suspects, he should stop reading, which I did after just 60 pages.	2004-08-22

The title of this book originates with the murder at the center of this mystery novel. Aidan Hope is found bludgeoned to death by a heavy glass ashtray in his bed and breakfast room. His cousin, and former partner in a software firm, Alison Hope, is accused of the murder. (Thus, Hope vs. Hope).<br /><br />One of the fun things with the book is that it is set in England and is full of British-isms, such as the phrase \\"Sod you!\\" which must be about the same as \\"Screw you!\\" The mystery itself is not too bad, but the editing job was at times heavy-handed. At times, there is almost an excess of detail. But, at others, it feels like entire scenes have been cut to shorten the book.  A smaller font would have been much more preferable to butchering the text.<br /><br />My final grade is \\"3 stars\\", mostly due to poor editing and my irritation at it.	2004-08-22

His attempts at escape are interesting but the FBI agents are pretty lame (the female agent is hyper-concerned at being treated as an equal but is always having heart palpatations when her cute boss stands near her).<br /><br />So, it is a choppy read.	2004-08-22

Ambrose was a prolific military historian and this book is a re-print of 15 articles he had published in various magazines over the years. Most are short and full of insight.

Rodriguez is a San Francisco-based writer who was asked to write a book about being Hispanic in America. I doubt this was the book that the publisher had in mind when they asked. Rodriguez is a political maverick whose thesis is that America is becoming \\"Brown\\" - a mixture of Anglo, Hispanic, Black, Asian and whatever else you want to throw in. America can embrace this future (and probably will) or it can reject it and deny the reality that surrounds us all (and does it matter if you deny reality - it is still there).<br /><br />I first heard of Rodriguez on C-Span. He was giving a speech at the Texas Book Fair created by Laura Bush. His speech was truly wonderful and I just had to find his book. I could go into detail on his observations, but you would much prefer if you would read it the way he put them in his book - his writing style is so fluid that he sneaks major concepts into your thoughts before you even realize that they are there. I seriously enjoyed this book - at the risk of sounding like the back of a book cover - here are some thoughts that crossed my mind while reading it - important, poignant, personal and filled with insights.	2004-08-22

It is split into 3 areas - about one-half of the book is straight biography, about one-third is an analysis of the character of our first president and the balance is an analysis of what it means to be a founding father, how Washington measures up to that ideal and what kind of \\"father\\" he was.<br /><br />The biography section is great - straightforward and written in an engaging and lively style. The character portion bogs down quite a bit and the founding father section is interesting (it asserts that he was the kind of father who was most concerned with preparing his children for life outside of his home - life on their own. He encourage other people to step into leadership roles to fill the vacuum that would be there when he walked away from the national spotlight.)<br /><br />One quote, above all, highlights the best parts of Washington. It comes from Napoleon, who comments in a moment of self-pity after Waterloo, \\"They wanted me to be another Washington.\\" Think of it - Washington was handed the power to be a dictator and he turned it down. In fact, this book mentions that in all of Washington's letters, he only gets truly angry at one man, and immediately writes a rough letter to a colleague who suggests that Washington make himself king when the Articles of Confederation government begins to founder.<br /><br />Brookhiser makes an interesting observation about Washington's impact on American politics by pointing out the length of time he was nationally prominent in comparison with other American leaders. For example, FDR was president for 12 years, Reagan was only politically important for the 8 years of his presidency, Eisenhower was important for the 8 years of his presidency plus his time as a general in WWII (12 years total). Lincoln - 7 years if you count from the time of the famed Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858. Washington, in comparison was a national figure for 24 years - 17 of them as the leader of the country (you've got to count him as de facto leader of the country while he was leading the Continental Army since everybody knew that if he failed the whole Revolution would fail).<br /><br />Brookhiser focuses on Washington and slavery in the character portion of the biography and, while Washington does not live up to modern standards on this issue, he was remarkably progressive for his time. He refused to sell any of his slaves since that would tear apart families. He is the only American president who freed his slaves upon his death. Washington seems to have dealt with the contadictions of \\"All men are created equal...\\" and slavery by mostly ignoring it.<br /><br />So, to sum up, there are 3 sections to the book and I found the middle section to be a bit tedious.al figure for 24 years - 17 of them as the leader of the country (you've got to count him as de facto leader of the country while he was leading the Continental Army since everybody knew that if he failed the whole Revolution would fail).  <br /> <br />Brookhiser focuses on Washington and slavery in the character portion of the biography and, while Washington does not live up to modern standards on this issue, he was remarkably progressive for his time.

The ending was way too abrupt (he completes all of the above parenthetical accomplishments in 35 pages) and the language was too clunky. I realize its a style thing, but it's like Mr. Anderson sat in front of his typewriter with a thesarous and looked for the more macho version of each verb used to describe Conan's behavior. He never throws anything, he heaves it. He always cleaves skulls, rather than splits them. I got tired of it rather quickly.	2004-08-21

To my disappointment, I found that the original Conan has every feature to his character that I disliked magnified by a factor of 10!<br /><br />But, to be honest, what has turned me off with both books is both authors' use of language - it is as if they both sat with a thesaurus and looked for the macho words to substitute for the regular ones.

Yes, it is way too cluttered and the ending is hackneyed, as most things Trek are, but it was an entertaining read.

In fact, I bought this one because I enjoyed his first novel, \\"The Black Flower\\" so much. This book is diferent the \\"The Black Flower\\", which was heavy on texture and feel. This book is every bit the equal of the first, but much more focused on plot and theme.<br /><br />So, what is the theme? Its in the title. The Year of Jubilo refers to the Old Testament Hebrew tradition called the Year of Jubilee. Every 7 years, all slaves were forever released from bondage. This novel explores freedom of all sorts in a (barely) post-Civil War Alabam town. There is, obviously, the newly-won freddom of the slaves, but that is barely brushed upon in favor of deeper themes. There is freedom (or not) from the past, guilt, the entanglements of family, family honor, regional honor, friendship, obligations of social position and even love.<br /><br />All of this is mostly told through two characters, Gawain Harper, a former college professor who joined the Confederate army to prove he was worthy to the father of the woman he loves and Harry Stribling, a former newspaperman who served in the Confederate cavalry during the war and is now a self-proclaimed philosopher. Bahr is not limited to these two characters, though. He has created a whole community in this book. Characters range from the Union colonel in charge of the occupying force to a former slave chaser to a smuggler.<br /><br />The smuggler, King Solomon Gault, is by far the most interesting character. He has avoided the real war all together and has made himself rich by smuggling during the war. He literally sees himself as a god unto himself and he callously uses and destroys a great number of people to pump up his own sense of grandeur and freedom. He is the antagonist and all of the advances in the plot move through him and the reactions to him.<br /><br />This novel has rich characters and sometimes almost poetic scene setting. It is a joy to read. I laughed out loud at parts and was surprised at the brutality and abruptness of other parts.

As you may know, I taught for 7 years in an inner-city middle school. The issue of race in America came up daily, and some days it was an ever-present feature. I was forced to think about it all of the time and all I know is that I don't know enough to solve the issues and no one ever will. Nevertheless, on ocassion I am moved to visit these issues again. This book seemed to be as good a place as any.<br /><br />Tony Brown is a Black man (he prefers that term) who has hosted a PBS discussion show called \\"Tony Brown's Journal\\" for years. He also hosts a Saturday talk show on WLS 890 AM out of Chicago that can be heard throughout the midwest thanks to their high wattage broadcast strength.<br /><br />He is an interesting man and a good discussion leader on his shows. His views were fairly consistent with my own, although I think that his preceptions of white america are a little off, just as he would undoubtedly think that my views of black America are off. The first 1/3 and the last 1/3 are full of pretty good thoughts, observations and ideas, except for their repitiveness.<br /><br />The middle 1/3 is a bit bizarre. It concerns AIDS and his denial that it even exists. He claims that AIDS is not real because there are 30+ diseases that are associated with it. He wonders how certain types of cancers and certain types of fungal infections and viruses can all be from the same disease. He misunderstands that these diseases are presumed to be symptoms of AIDS since they are rare and usually are only present to people with depressed immune systems - which happens to people with AIDS (thus its name). He also touts a theory that claims that AIDS was started accidentally by using viruses from Monkeys to create a Smallpox vaccine that was used in Africa in the 1970s.

Will the murderer be satisfied with just the murder of a member of the Italian diplomatic corps who had a reputation for stealing Italian masterpieces and selling them to foreign buyers? Are the rumors of forged paintings true? Did someone steal a priceless piece of art?<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />Mrs. Truman knows her stuff when it comes to the Washington, D.C. social scene because yes, she is the daughter of Harry Truman.<br /><br />This is really a decent book. I've read others in this series and found them of varying quality. However, I found the topic interesting and I was introduced to the concept of 'Art Police.' Washington, D.C. has its very own squad to investigate art fraud and robbery.<br /><br />There are characters that were introduced in other books.<br /><br />The end of the book was a little...strange. But, overall I give this book '4 stars.'	2004-08-11

It is advertised as a courtroom thriller but that is just as accurate as saying the movie \\"The Princess Bride\\" is a childhood bedtime story. True, it is, but it is so much more. In this case, the story is framed by about 10 pages of courtroom stuff just to give the story a bit of context, but it really is just a plain old novel - with all the foibles and follies that accompany good character creation.	2004-08-11

I have to agree and disagree. It is a good book - it really does approach the level of being a great farce of a detective novel. The client is outrageous and the people he investigates are larger than life throughout the story. At times, Waterman is the only sane man in the room. It makes it a fun ride - but I finished the book pleased but quite sure that it could have been even more if Ford had pushed a bit more. I would have liked for him to have met other bizarre personages that were attending the food show, but the climactic scene at the steakhouse with the helicopter and the barbecue was certainly odd and funny enough in its own right.<br /><br /> Like all of the Waterman novels, it may behoove the reader to jot down some notes as you go along because the author does little to remind the reader who the characters are as the story progresses. The murder victim is introduced and not mentioned again until he is killed about 100 pages later. I had to think hard about who this guy was and why it was important to the story that he was dead.<br /><br /> I would recommend reading the other Waterman books (Who In Hell is Wanda Fuca?, Cast in Stone, The Bum's Rush) before reading this one.<br /><br /> I give this book a &quot;4 stars&quot; - fun but I'm struck by the unrealized potential.	2004-08-04

The title basically says it all. This fascinating book uses Daytona International Speedway and the old racing surface of Daytona Beach itself as its lens to focus on the world of NASCAR. Hinton has been a beat reporter covering NASCAR since the mid-1970s and knows all of the old stories and Hinton is able to package them so that the reader is reading one little vignette after another until the history of Daytona is told.<br /><br /> I was reading another book when I picked up this one (a Christmas gift that I hadn't really paid a lot of attention to) and began thumbing through it. I couldn't put it down! It is well-written and at times it is laugh out loud funny, especially if you are a NASCAR fan and are familiar with the older, retired drivers.<br /><br /> However, a couple of disturbing, trivial factual errors throw a negative light on the book as a whole. Two that I noted were Hinton's assertion that no rookie has won the Indy 500 since the 1926 race (in case you're wondering, Daytona Beach used to be used as a high-speed test site, much like Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah is used today and the 1926 winner died making such a high-speed run). I knew that his assertion was wrong since I witnessed rookies win the 2000 race (Juan Montoya) and the 2001 race (Helio Castroneves) - both were well-before publishing time for his book. Besides that, 2 minutes on Google told me there were two others - the 1927 and 1966 winners.<br /><br /> Secondly, he makes the assertion that California driver Willie T. Ribbs was encouraged by the example set by &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; to get drunk and play chasing games with the police in downtown Charlotte, NC in May of 1978. Since I spent a great deal of my own childhood watching the Dukes, I thought that that seemed a bit early. Sure enough, two more minutes on Google told me that the show premiered in January of 1979, so it really had no part in Ribbs' ill-conceived misadventures. Oddly enough, Ribbs' trip to the drunk tank gave Dale Earnhardt the chance to take his car - his first chance to drive a good car in the Winston Cup Series and this opportunity eventually led him to the career that made him a household name.<br /><br /> Despite these errors the book was a hoot to read and I'm sure I'll be lending it to every NASCAR fan I know.nk tank gave Dale Earnhardt the chance to take his car - his first chance to drive a good car in the Winston Cup Series and this opportunity eventually led him to the career that made him a household name. <br />  <br /> Despite these errors the book was a hoot to read and I'm sure I'll be lending it to every NASCAR fan I know. <br />  <br />	2004-07-27

Part of a series of approximately 20 books entitled Heroes of the Faith. It is edited and abridged from a larger work by Dan Harmon.<br /><br /> My review:  The book has large, direct quotes from other sources, including big chunks of the questioning of Luther at the Diet of Worms in 1521. This is most appropriate since Luther was a well-spoken as well as plain-spoke debater. His text is lively and interesting to read. Even to the modern reader his meaning is quite clear and devoid of all of the flowery Renaissance nonsense that entraps other writers and bores me to distraction.<br /><br />However, the larger text Harmon edited from left out Luther's most famous line: 'My conscience is captive to the Word of God...Here I stand I can do no other.' This is the image of Luther presented in every school book in the world - the solitary monk standing up to the entire church and against all of Europe's kings at the Diet of Worms on a matter of conscience and refusing to blink because, by God (literally), he thinks he is right and is willing to die for that belief. In my mind, this is one of those moments of heroism that everyone should admire, even if you are not a believer. But, the original text left it out!!! The height of his shining moment - gone!!<br /><br />Ironically, that quote is featured on the back of the book - it is in bold print and serves as the headline for the description of the book! AARRGH!<br /><br /> My grade: The book is, in general, informative and would serve as a decent introduction to Luther. However, I cannot forgive a biography that leaves out the single most dramatic line from the single most dramatic moment of its subject's life. Imagine a Lincoln biography without the Gettysburg Address, a Martin Luther King, Jr. biography without his 'I Have a Dream' speech or a Julius Caesar biography without 'Vini, vidi, vici.'<br /><br />***Reviewer's note: please read the comment section.

The only real thing he seemed to be doing was showing how unhinged some of the people who e-mailed him really are (lots of people have wished him ill for his points of view) and he uses these nutjobs as a brush to paint conservatives as a group as downright mean - in fact that is the title of one of his chapters. (despite his own admission that people fire off e-mails without thinking and say things that they would most likely never say to someone's face)<br /><br /> Finally, Colmes gets focused and the last 2/3 of his book is a decent read - even though he keeps the e-mail theme going and it really loses its effectiveness. His political commentary is full of the same type of political cheap shots that he accuses the Right of using, such as:<br /><br /> -Colmes has a little chart showing the political spectrum from left to right. He shows it going like this:<br /><br /> Communism Socialism Liberalism Conservatism Fascism Totalitarianism<br /><br /> And then he makes a big deal about how American conservatives are closer to totalitarianism than Liberals are. Come on. Was the USSR anything other than a totalitarian state?<br /><br /> -Colmes digs out specific comments from some Conservatives to show they are all racists (he likes Trent Lott, especially). I can do the same thing with Bill Clinton who once commented to the NAACP that if such and such bill were passed into law they could succeed like \\"regular people.\\"<br /><br /> -Colmes blames Bush for the malnutrition rampant among Afghanistan's children and the and the fact that one-fourth of Afghan children don't live to reach the age of 5. The publishing date of this UNICEF report? October 2001. Yes, I'm sure Bush caused all of this, despite the fact that the Taliban controlled Afghanistan when the stats were compiled.<br /><br /> -He claims that the Conservatives do all of the nasty smear ads. His proof - Willie Horton. He ignores the Bush is Hitler ads posted by moveon.org and two awful NAACP's ads in the 2000 election. One stated electing Bush will just result in more murders of black men - it featured a pickup truck dragging a logging chain and the daughter of the man who was killed by dragging in Texas (the perpetrators are now in prison for the rest of their lives). Another ad against John Ashcroft said that a vote for a Republican is a vote for more black churches to be burnt down.<br /><br /> -I could go on (really - I have more than a dozen similar things, but I can't really imagine who'd want to read them all.)<br /><br /> Colmes has a quirky sense of humor and he makes frequent comments that sometimes make the reader nearly laugh out loud. He also does something interesting - he includes a chapter about where he thinks Conservatives are right and Liberals are wrong. Topics include race reparations and securing our border.<br /><br /> So, all in all, I give this book \\"3 stars\\" - the choice of using the e-mails actually hurts the book. The unfocused first quarter of the book was frustrating. The cheap shots were annoying, but to be expected - this is not the first book of this type that I've read.

His father was a Muslim. He was raised in Saudi Arabia. He is now a Presbyterian minister in the United States. His short, 10 chapter book introduces the reader to the Koran by telling its history and the common touchpoints that it shares with the Bible, Christian tradition and Jewish tradition. Elass also introduces the reader to the proper handling of the Koran and has a balanced discussion on the role of Jihad in Islam, as defined in the Koran. An optional Bible study is located at the back of the book with lots of questions designed for group discussion.<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />An absolutely excellent book! The reader is not required to be a Christian to understand the book - but a working knowledge of Christian tradition and the Bible would help. Mateen Elass has produced a wonderful introduction to Islam and the Koran. He is respectful of Islam throughout the book, but it is clear that he is writing from the Christian perspective.<br /><br />I have but one complaint: he has excellent commentary in his endnotes that complement the text. Unfortunately, I discovered this about halfway through the book. I wish it had been footnotes instead.<br /><br />I'll be on the lookout for another book by Elass. Might I suggest a book on Islam itself? Or, perhaps Muslim customs and holidays?	2004-07-21

Summary of the book:<br /><br />Foxman uses the common comment that the world has learned its lesson during World War II and will \\"never again\\" let hate do what it did to the Jews in World War II. He uses a question mark because he points to some rather depressing trends in this well-researched book that mark a rise of anti-semitism throughout the world, even in Japan. (reviewers note: How many Jews actually live in Japan? How many Japanese actually know what the Jewish religion is? I'm assuming this is just a nutball group that hates just about everybody and just threw the Jews in too).<br /><br />Foxman is the head of the Anti-Defamation League, a group based in New York City that monitors Anti-Semitic activity throughout the world.<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />Foxman is a bit too sensitive (something that he admits he is trying to avoid), but he's right,there are terribly disturbing anti-Semitic trends, especially in his chapter 7 concerning very popular Muslim beliefs concerning Jews (he quotes opinion polls and continuing attacks that come from mainstream Muslim newspapers. Unfortunately, from an editing standpoint, he ends up with Chapter 8 - a chapter about anti-Semitism in Hollywood and popular entertainment. It is by far his weakest chapter, a point he virtually concedes because this is where he makes his comments about not wanting to appear too sensitive.<br /><br />Foxman has an anti-Semitism quiz developed by the Anti-Defamation League. He says you qualify as \\"most\\" Anti-Semitic if you agree with six or more of the following:<br /><br />1) Jews stick together more than other Americans.<br /><br />2) Jews always like to be at the head of things.<br /><br />3) Jews are more loyal to Israel than America.<br /><br />4) Jews have too much power in the U.S. today.<br /><br />5) Jews have too much control and influence on Wall Street.<br /><br />6) Jews have too much power in the business world.<br /><br />7) Jews have a lot of irritating faults.<br /><br />8) Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want.<br /><br />9) Jewish businesspeople are so shrewd that others don't have a fair chance at competition.<br /><br />10) Jews don't care what happens to anyone but their own kind.<br /><br />11) Jews are not just as honest as other businesspeople.<br /><br />I scored a zero out of 11 on this test. However, Foxman would still consider me an anti-Semite. He has 2 long chapters on Jewish-Christian relations (one for Catholics worldwide and one for American Protestants) and since I am a Christian that believes that Christ is the only way to heaven, I am an anti-Semite.<br /><br />Oh, well. No matter Foxman's opinion, I will continue to consider myself not anti-Semitic, especially in light of some of the absolutely ignorant comments coming from some of my rural Indiana students. I do believe that I am the only one that has ever confronted some of them. Here's what they were doing: they were using the word Jew and Jewish as an insult term - meaning stupid. So, when someone would say something stupid some others would say, \\"That's so Jewish!\\" or \\"You're such a Jew!\\". So, anyway, I'd boot their asses out to the hall so fast that their heads would spin and we would have a lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong talk. I can tolerate a lot of ignorant things but racism is not one of them. I've had this conversation about 5 times in the last two years, but not for the last 5 or 6 months. Maybe it has stopped or maybe it has just stopped around me.<br /><br />To sum up: This book receives a \\"4 stars\\".

He backs it up with a ton of statistics. To the credit of Brimelow, this could have been a stale listing of statistics punctuated by charts. However, he writes in a lively style and backs up his assertions with independent sources of information as well as damning quotes from movers and shakers in the NEA and the AFT.<br /><br />As an unsatisfied member of the NEA, I found the book to be quite eye-opening. It was also interesting to me since the Indiana branch of the NEA (Indiana State Teachers Association) was the source of a lot of his material and that is my State Association.<br /><br />This is a thought-provoking and challenging book. He does not just stand there and point out problems. He also 24 suggestions at the end of his book, although he is quick to note that this is a wish list and it will be extremely unlikely that half of these could ever see the light of day.	2004-07-15

It can get a bit repetitive as the author tries to fully explain how Mexico's history has caused their culture to react certain ways and to see things as they do. I must have read the sordid history of the Conquest of Mexico and its exlpoitation by both Church and Spain 25 times.<br />The cultural elements are well-explained, very informative and usually well-written. FREQUENT spelling errors mar the book as do occasional historical errors. His math facts concerning the growth of the Mestizo population in Mexico also conflict with one another, depending on the entry you read.<br />Was the book valuable?

If you live near or work with Hispanics in the United States it will also be of considerable value.<br />Despite the flaws that I mentioned above, I am still giving this book 4 Stars.<br />A note for another reviewer of this book (Ktruse from the UK) - the reason that the author refers to Americans as North Americans in the book is that Mexicans call Americans &quot;Norteamericanos&quot;.

Not a mean feat.<br />Brimelow is a writer for Forbes Magazine and, apparently, he enjoys digging into controversial topics. I've also reviewed another of his books concerning Teacher's Unions.<br /> He goes after the potentially explosive topic of immigration in two ways. First, he looks at the ways the current laws were supposed to have worked by delving in to the original debates of 1965. Secondly, he goes after America's cherished beliefs about immigration and asks rather simple questions that usually dismantle those beliefs as easily as a breeze destroys a house of cards. He tiptoes on the edge of sounding racist (he often questions whether it is in the best interest of the USA to dramatically alter its ethnic and cultural base without so much as having had one serious debate on the matter in the Congress).<br />He begins with looking at the promises of Ted Kennedy in speeches made in Senate Committee in 1965 concerning the then-proposed (now current system). Kennedy promised that immigration would not increase if his proposed changes were enacted (it has quadrupled) and that the ethnic mix of the country would not change (it has - hispanics up from 3% to 13%. Asians up from 1% to 3%. Whites as a percentage of population have dropped from 85% to 70%.) Brimelow's most compelling argument, in my mind, is that, at the very least, the USA needs to have an open, frank discussion concerning immigration and at decide if the system we have accidentally created is the one we really want.<br />The big problem with the current system, according to Brimelow, is that it focuses on family re-unification rather than filling needs that our country has. Rather than going through long details about the system, I'd rather just recommend the book.mend the book.	2004-07-15

This book was interesting to read. His theories are infectious and at times you find yourself marvelling at all of the wonderful coincidences and halfway believing Mr. Hancock. Other times, he takes liberal use of supposition (even going so far as to suppose what Albert Einstein would have thought of one of his ideas) and he throws out so many ideas that he reminds me of a desperate defense attorney who throws out any idea to throw doubt on the prosecutor's case. Here, Mr. Hancock throws out any number of theories, including Atlantis; aliens (but never says it - but he leads you that way); Egyptians coming to Europe, Asia, South America and Polynesia; the use of magic or an unknown force to build ancient megaliths and more.<br />I enjoyed the book but there are occassional bad photographs that mar the book - he refers to one picture two or three different times and the picture is not clear - the image has been worn too much over time. That would have been the perfect time for a traced outline of the picture, like he does at other times. Sometimes shadows obscure the images he would like us to see - the shadows make the pictures quite beautiful but the images are the point of the exercise. However, in general the quality of the pictures reminds me of those of National Geographic.<br />Mr. Hancock poses so many theories that he is sorely in need of a chart in the back of his book so that we can quickly see some of the theories and how the data looks when compared across the board.<br />However, in defense of his book, he quite freely admits that this is a work in progress and the research has barely begun. I would not consider this to be the final word from Mr. Hancock - rather, I would treat this as more of an interim report stating some of the interesting things he has found and a few theories that might help to explain them.<br />I give this book &quot;5 stars&quot; because he writes about so many of the interesting ancient sites and, if nothing else, has thrown an interesting new light on them (Graham points out that most 'legitimate' researchers won't even come to Easter Island anymore for fear of being thought to be one of the 'crazy' researchers). I don't quite buy his theories, but I'm open to reading more of what he has to say.<br />YOu may also see Mr. Hancock on TLC or Discovery Channel with entertaining documentaries that cover most of these same topics in a less thorough but highly entertaining manner.interesting new light on them (Graham points out that most 'legitimate' researchers won't even come to Easter Island anymore for fear of being thought to be one of the 'crazy' researchers).

I especially enjoyed the one concerning Teddy Roosevelt following through with his plan to ban college football unless they did something to curb the extreme violence (23 young men died in the 1905 season). The consequences were interesting and I thought very plausible.<br />The book is marred by a few factual errors. They really are not terribly important to the outcome of the author's alternate histories but show a sloppiness in editing. Some examples are placing the Revolutionary War fort of Kaskaskia in present-day Kentucky when it is actually in Illinois and saying that people blamed Lincoln's assassination on people who were wanting to revive the Union cause (obviously the Union cause was in great shape by the point of the war - I assume his editors did not catch it and he meant to say Confederate).<br />Despite the errors, the book is still a fun read.<br />The author has a website for the book at [...] with a couple of his alternate histories if you want to get a feel for the book.	2004-07-01
US	18800155	RAZ1HGGYKC9SY	0595159923	821620086	Tides of War	Books	3	0	0	N	N	OK thriller with a feature that irritated me to no end...	A short summary:<br />Set on the eve of the D-day invasion, the book features American Lt. Skeet Merrill and his ultra-lovely female spy partner, a Norwegian named Sigi Peterson. Their goal is to disrupt the German U-boats that are massing at a French shipyard in order to deploy against the Allied armada about to launch the invasion at Normandy.<br />The book is full of intrigue all around - is the U-Boat captain truly a loyal German? What are Sigi's secret orders? Which members of the French Resistance can be trusted? Who will Sigi sleep with next?<br />My review:<br />It is a tolerable thriller with a very irritating feature about the writing. For me, the most irritating thing was how the author treats a Dutch member of the French Resistance, Erika Vermeer. Erika is a lesbian - a fact that we are never allowed to forget since the author constantly refers to her as \\"the lesbian\\" (as in, \\"the lesbian crossed the room\\" and \\"the lesbian sat quietly and drank the coffee\\"), rather than using the pronoun \\"she\\". This irritates me as much as referring to a black character as \\"the black man\\" or \\"the negro,\\" rather than using his name or \\"he\\". Muir didn't refer to the heterosexual characters by their sexual preferences, so why continually do it with Erika Vermeer? Were we going to forget that the cross-dressing masculine female character that starred in a cross-dressing revue in Paris was a lesbian?<br />I give it an unenthusiastic 3 stars.	2004-07-01

The police have 7 suspects, including the dedicated heroine of the story, history professor Antonia Nielsen. We follow along with Nielsen as she searches for her star protege and friend.<br />My review:<br />The mystery was good in that I was surprised at the murderer (and it made sense), but it was bad in that I felt that it was written rather oddly. The book was set in an American college campus but the whole feel and texture of the book said, &quot;England.&quot; The characters spoke like they were from England but trying to speak like Americans. It really was rather disconcerting and at one point I had to go back and re-read the first few pages to make sure that the book was actually set in the United States.<br />The book also had a major problem in that the police, who were supposed to have done a thorough job looking for this missing girl and the missing artifacts should have solved the whole mystery in a single afternoon. I don't want to give away any more than that.	2004-06-29

I found a great number of the biographies to be too short and lacking some historical context (once again, the result of it being a daily devotional rather than a true written history of the saints). The exception was St. Laurence (Lawrence) who stood up to the Roman government with a great sense of humor.<br /><br />Laurence was a deacon in the Church of Rome and was told to bring the Roman prefect the wealth of his church. He promised he would and on the appointed day he brought thousands of people to the prefect's courtyard and said that these people were the treasure of the church. The prefect did not find it amusing and Laurence was burned to death on a gridiron (like a giant barbecue grill). While he was being grilled to death, Lawrence was asked if he wanted to recant his faith. He told the executioner to step closer and told him to turn him over because he was done on that side!<br /><br />As a book to read straight through, I give this book a \\"D\\".<br />As a daily devotional, I give this book a \\"C\\".	2004-06-29

I sort of had it figured out but its resolution was still satisfying. The only problem I have with the book is the cover. The cover is a composite of a couple of events that happened in the book, but one of them is definitely in the last quarter of the book and I kept wondering when it was going to happen (I won't tell you so as not to spoil it for you as well).	2004-06-29

In most of the books, Cain runs a philanthropical organization. In this book, she has left the foundation and is casting about for the finances to start another foundation in order to help the people of the New England seaport city of Port Frederick.<br />While this is happening her husband has a mysterious visit from a teenage boy who claims that Geoff is his biological father and he wants nothing to do with Geoff except that he use his position as a policeman to re-investigate the murder-suicide of his parents and come up with a different conclusion.<br />This novel is mostly notable for the fact that its author makes a serious effort to raise the bar in this series of run-of-the-mill mysteries. What she's created here is an actual novel - full of themes and interesting trips into her character's psyches. This book has all of the necessary ingredients for a book discussion group. I was pleasantly surprised.<br />The only quibble I have with the book is a section about 2/3 of the way through it in which a minister who has been a recurring character throughout the series makes some commentary on sin and forgiveness and Christianity. It is evident that the author truly does not grasp these concepts as they are taught in Christianity so I wish she'd have had the comments made by a different character, rather than a minister. However, this is more than compensated for by the rather surprising twist of an ending - I could not put down the book for the last 20 pages, despite the fact that it nearly made me late for work.	2004-06-29

US	18800155	R1X04YBI8VM1OL	0380703475	863704491	Chiefs	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fabulous	This is the story of a succession of police chiefs in Delano, Georgia, a small town. It reminds me of a James Michener novel in that the main characters change as time progresses, but the story continues on in the same locale. This novel is also the story of race relations in rural Georgia from the 1920s to the 1960s.<br />The characters are very good - there's a wide variety of characters here. One of the sherrifs is especially vile, but you root for him as he is tracking down a serial killer that stalks, rapes and kills young men over the course of 40 years.<br />Stuart Woods is sort of a hack nowadays, writing formulaic detective thrillers, but this is undoubtedly the best of his that I've read. Here is the highest praise I can give it - this book is a book that I wish I had written - it has heart, danger, loyalty and a host of other qualities that make it great.	2004-05-15

In the forward McPherson notes that there is &quot;a need for a documentary collection that will present all aspects of the Negro's role in the war largely in the Negro's own words...this book is designed to fill that need.&quot; McPherson strings together quote after quote from Black newspapers, letters and speeches with relatively sparse commentary in between.<br />The book addresses 22 topics - from pre-war commentary on Abraham Lincoln to postwar lamentations about the failure of Reconstruction.<br />My Review<br />Unfortunately, the very strength of this book (all of the quotes) made it, at times, a tedious read for me. I found the style of the book to be a chore to read. I'll keep this book in my personal collection of Civil War material because as a collection of source material it is unmatched and I may have need to utilize it when it comes time to get my master's degree. As a history of the Civil War it is effective, informative but ultimately a chore to read.	2004-05-15

Nice amount of details. I've been to the battlefield twice and read numerous histories and taken one class so I have no problem visualizing the battlefield in my mind. This would be an excellent addition for any visitor to the battlefield. The chapters are short enough that a thoughtful tourist would have no problem reading them as he/she stood there.<br />It is a bit pricy for its size ($16.00 retail, I got it for $11.00 here at Amazon.com which is still quite a bit for a 140 page small hardback book) but perhaps they'll come out with a paperback. Even if they don't, I know I've seen similarly-priced tourbooks that weren't as well-written.<br />It would have helped to have pictures to help orient the tourist, but this would necessitate editing of the book if the Parks Department begins the restoration projects McPherson mentions (and hopes for). These include removing woods that have grown up since the battle and restoring fences and orchards that have been removed.<br />I own a number of McPherson's books. I'll be glad to put this one on the shelf with the others. Whenever I can convince my wife to let me return to Gettysburg (she gets bored after a couple of hours, I could spend days), I'll bring it along, that's for sure!	2004-05-15
