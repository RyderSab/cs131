(median)	Sally Caldwell has always enjoyed a tempestuous relationship with author and Algebra biographer Kenn Amdahl, and there are allusions to that relationship in the cover notes of this stunning album from one of the most enigmatic bands of the last century, Statistics. Back in the 70's, you were either a Blurred fan, or a Oascissor Sisters fan, and that analogy can be applied to Statistics and their archrivals Algebra. Statistics fans, or \\"nerds\\", as they christened themselves, hated Algebra, and their fans (\\"geeks\\"), rivalries often spilling over into chanting, violence, and bottle throwing at concerts. Caldwell cheekily refers to Amdahl as a \\"nuisance parameter\\" in her detailed sleeve notes - a jibe that will surely have recriminations, although not on the same scale as those involving Tupac Shaker, this reviewer hopes.<br />There are several stand-out tracks on this album, including \\"Chi Squared\\", \\"The Statistic T\\", and the haunting \\"Correlation Coefficient\\", with its normal distribution of panpipes.<br />\\"Sum of Squares\\", played on an Unbiased Estimate of trumpets is the Confounding Factor on this album.<br />Take the F test and buy this album today. A sampling distribution shows the average deviation of the cost of this album to be a measly 2 dollars 14 cents!<br />Excellent work.	2005-07-12

Everyone likes a kebab after a night out on the sauce. Patty Reed liked them more than other people. \\"The Story of the Donner Party\\" is the latest offering from the much-maligned Louise Baldwin, and is a riotous romp of Dickensianesque farce, set as it is in turn-of-the-19th-century California. With her flowery prose and powerful metaphors, Baldwin takes us on a warts-and-all ride through an eventful evening in Ms Reed's life. There's murder, intrigue and suspense. Gasp for breath as Ms Reeds loyal friend Lauren chokes to death on some of that white stuff you sometimes find in the mixed salad you get at 'bab shops. Is it cabbage? I think it's cabbage. It might be cabbage but I'm not sure. Where I live, it'd be kohl-rabi. Anyway. Cry fat, sympathetic tears of white-hot laughter as Derek drunkenly says \\"yes\\" and ends up with chili sauce on his kebab, but smiles gamely as he forces himself to eat it to win honour amongst his gnarled gold-digger compatriots. Twitch with suspicion as Patty finds \\"mint sauce\\" on the collar of her husbands shirt collar. Is it mint sauce, or toothpaste? Or something more sinister?<br /><br />You'll find out when you buy this whirlwind adventure romance novel book. Patty Reed's Doll: The Story of the Donner Party contains small parts and may have been assembled in a factory where nuts are processed.<br /><br />A rip-roaring read. Top marks!	2005-07-11

Lobsters are great, aren't they? They're good with kids, they're polite, they make great pets, and they taste finger-licking good with a portion of mayo on the side.<br /><br />There's so much more to your average Joe Lobster, though, and this marvellous book (from the same people that brought us \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\") explodes the myths surrounding this leviathan of the deep.<br /><br />Fisherman and Scientists share with us their most secret secrets as we discover that the best way to get rare blonde lobsters into a pot is to tell them that it's a hot tub.<br /><br />Laugh out loud at the chapter where Chris Martin (off of Coldplay) divulges the fact he'd rather have lobsters on his piano than crabs on his organ.<br /><br />Cry with sympathy when you discover Bernard Manning cancelled his Canadian Tour because he couldn't find any good lobster jokes. They keep them all to themselves, you see, they're shellfish like that.<br /><br />Even Gordo McRamsay, the famous cussing Welsh chef, makes an appearance with the heartrending story of a young lobster called Harry. Having chosen Harry as his meal, a customer at Gordo's restaurant complains that Harry only has one claw. Upon hearing the news that Harry lost a claw in a fight with another lobster, the customer demands to be brought the winner. I was shedding real tears after reading that, and I'm sure you will be too.<br /><br />There's more heartache with the revelation that all lobsters are barred from pubs and clubs up and down the country. Read one barman's testimony - \\"He came in here, giving it all that *barman makes talky-talky claw shapes with hands*\\"<br /><br />A great book, one that I'm sure you'll be crustachin' to get your claws on.	2005-07-11

We know that bees have been producing honey as they do today for at least 150 million years.<br /><br />But did you know that honey bees' wings stroke 11,400 times per minute, or that a colony of bees can have 50,000 to 60,000 workers? I certainly didn't until I'd read this well written and informative book. It is a hive of bee-related information and is a must for the budding apiculturist.<br /><br />I for one was amazed to read some of the shocking revelations laid bare about the secret life of one of our most fondly appreciated insects. For example, I was stunned to read that when a queen bee burps, she issues a royal pardon. She also travels around her hive being throne by her fellow workers, although sometimes she catches the buzz.<br /><br />I was incredulous to read that a bee's favourite pop group is the Bee Gees, but that it has to hum their songs because it's forgotten the words. By the time I'd got to the chapter about a bee's favourite snack being bumble gum I had to stop reading and put the book down in goggle-eyed disbelief.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended!	2004-12-10

Her word play and smart, snappy prose keep children of all ages entertained for hours. \\"The Wind Blew\\" is part of her \\"Metre-ology\\" (literally \\"Weather Poetry\\") series, and is one of the strongest candidates to win the John Kettley Prize later this year. If you're new to Pat (as her fans, or \\"patters\\" call her) then I'd suggest you try \\"The Rain Read\\" first. Her first book, \\"The Snow Yello\\" was pulled from the shelves when the Swiss electro-pop noise-mongers after which the book was named banned Hutchins from using their famous moniker and threatened legal action. Copies of this rare book can fetch up to 60 pence on ebay.<br /><br />\\"The Wind Blew\\" charms and disarms in equal measures, and younger children will be delighted and excited by the colourful illustrations.

The hilarious anecdote about \\"that Saturday two Decembers ago when it snowed\\" will have you laughing out loud, and the touching third chapter - \\"one Saturday it got a bit foggy\\" - left this reviewer reaching for the Kleenex.<br /><br />Fans of Root's previous work will not be disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed her last two books, \\"Saturated Sunday\\" and \\"Muggy Monday\\". \\"Soggy Saturday\\" is, essentially, more of the same, but when Root's compelling prose is as enjoyable as it is captivating, that really is no bad thing.<br /><br />I hear she's already planning a sequel - \\"Wet Wednesday\\".

It is hard to feel empathy for Arthur, the main character in this engaging but factually inaccurate Thanksgiving tale by Daniel Pinkwater, as he bumbles his way from one disaster to another. The premise that not a single shopkeeper in the whole of Hoboken has a turkey in their freezer is, at best, far-fetched. At worst, it is factually inaccurate and a damning incitement on Pinkwater's research whilst writing this book. This reviewer knows for a fact that Sandra D's Mini Mart, 453 5th St, had a freezer full of plump gobblers last Thanksgiving, and had Arthur visited King's Super market, 1212 Hudson St, he'd have found cranberry sauce as well. I'm all for warming, cheery tales of triumph over tragedy, but when they're this sloppy with the detail, they're hard to swallow. My nephew's first comment when he read this book was \\"I done a guff\\", and, quite frankly, I think that says it all. Disappointing.	2004-08-12

The production, is at times, a little weak, but the heart-rending &quot;ax * ax + bx + c = 0&quot; recorded live in Lecture Theatre 2.13 is probably one of Algebra's finest moments. There's some real gems on this album - The stunning 15 minute opus &quot;Quadratic/Equivalence&quot; being a case in point.

Jack Long is, for me, a master of horticultural crime, and his latest work, \\"The Case of the Missing Lettuce\\" is up there with some of the classics of the genre. I'm talking about such masterpieces as Agatha Christie's \\"Miss Marple and the Mystery of the Misshapen Marrow\\", Polanowski's \\"One of our courgettes is missing\\", and of course Conan-Doyle's seminal \\"Sherlock Holmes and the stolen carrots\\".<br />In \\"The Case of the Missing Lettuce\\" the reader is kept guessing as to the whereabouts of the crispy-leafed vegetable right up until the final page - and the tension that has built up over the previous 8 pages is almost unbearable. Was it Jones, the farmer? Was it Bill Binkley, the loveable greengrocer? Or was it Mrs. Smith, the sprightly, love-lorn pensioner?

Whilst his prose may not be as descriptive as Watmough's, Boag still unearths some gems about the roly-poly Tudor womaniser which one might not have seen elsewhere. I was most impressed at Boag having unearthed the fact that Henry fashioned himself some wading gaters out of pigskin, and laced them with the hair of Anne of Cleeves. The usual stories are in there as well, including the famous &quot;pulling a 19lb pike out of the Thames&quot; (although I notice the weight of the fish differs somewhat from that mentioned in Watmough's version of events) - and the whimsical tale of fishing for sticklebacks in Barrowbrook Stream when Henry was a small child.

This book, shockingly aimed primarily at children, tells the horrific story of a group of Nottingham Forest supporters, known as the \\"Smash-Up gang\\" - a powerful, subversive offshoot of the \\"Tricky Trees\\". Through bloody, and often stomach churning prose, Seymour describes their rampage through the centre of local rivals Derby's city centre, and with almost child-like glee revels in the telling of wanton violence and destruction. As a concerned parent, and Derby County fan, I am appalled that this kind of material be so easily and readily available for young children to read. I had to stop reading the chapter devoted to the Smash-Up breaking into the Fat Cat Cafe Bar beer cellar and urinating into the Speckled Hen as it was too distressing to carry on. Awful.

The passion with which he sings &quot;Bake Me&quot; is purely breathtaking, as is the rousing &quot;Twas on the good Chip Venus&quot;.

It just doesn't work for me.	2002-12-12

Yann Martel has come a long way since his first novel, &quot;Story of Keybab&quot;, and this shows through in this Booker Prize winning novel, &quot;Life of Pi&quot;. Comparisons to Ian Hennessy's masterpiece, &quot;A Tale of Chipps&quot;, are unwarranted, and though the opening chapter &quot;Meat and Potato&quot; will prompt some to recall the work of Robert Courvoisier, in particular his maiden opus &quot;Chikken in a Baskit&quot;, the following two chapters, &quot;Chicken and Mushroom&quot;, and &quot;Steak and Kidney&quot; will put pay to such shallow-minded ideas. There is little wrong with this novel, and I can't highly recommend it enough, although some will find the penultimate chapter &quot;Lamb and Peas&quot; a little hard to swallow.	2002-12-10

One would have thought Mr. Matthews to have been the very last person to bring out a book on parasitology. The timing of this release, so close to Christmas, beggars belief. I for one will never buy any of his Turkey Nuggets again, if, as this book would have us believe, they are ridden with Ascarida galli and Capillaria amulata. That Crispy Golden Brown Breadcrumb coating you're chomping down on might not be what you expect. My advice would be not to buy this book but get some Pripsen in instead.	2002-12-10

From the opening stanza of \\"Red Flag's a-flying\\" to the haunting final verse of \\"On The Blob\\", \\"Snatch\\" knocks \\"The Vagina Monologues\\" into the proverbial Wizard's Sleeve.	2002-12-09

Eliot	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Interesting	During a career spanning 36 years Sir Stanley Matthews left fans with innumerable memories of his breathtaking footballing skills. None of them realised, however, just how astute he was at defining one of the early 20th century's greatest poets. Comparing Eliot's &quot;Mr. Mistoffelees&quot; to Moses' speech on Mount Sinai is perhaps a little far-fetched, but one can forgive old twinkle toes the odd slip now and again. I mean, he was a cracking footballer, wasn't he, even when he played for Stoke. And I'm a Derby fan, so that's high praise indeed.	2002-12-05

I would imagine that most American school children would know that \\"woohitika\\" means bravery, and not fortitude (which is, of course \\"wowacintanka\\"). I think you will find that The Great Spirit Skan made us with bones from Stone, and not Brick, like Gardiner would have us believe, and it was Spider that sent Wolf to the Underworld, and not \\"Yucky Wucky Stinky Winky Cockroach\\". The author has tried hard to create a touching novel about a young boy going through the agonies and indecision of pubescence, and his realtionship with a dog and a virile man much older than himself, but it's the details that let the story down. Finally, it was buffalo that roamed the Great Plains, and not \\"lanky legged, boggle eyed giraffes\\". Shocking.	2002-12-05

I bought this for my grandmother a few weeks before Christmas 2001 in anticipation of a lovely slap-up turkey dinner with lump-free gravy. I'd read a previous customers review claiming they'd bought it and it had revolutionised their Sunday lunches, but I have to say I was very disappointed. Not only was the gravy still lumpy, but it was cold, and hairy. I wouldn't buy this book again.	2002-11-29

From the opening stanza of \\"The Boy What Done A Poo\\" and the haunting reworking of Goldstein's \\"Ahhh, I'm telling Miss of you\\" this anthology will thrill children of all ages, and grown ups too!<br />(I must point out, however, that the inclusion of controversial poet Sean Hickey's \\"Bang Bang You're Dead 50 Bullets In Your Head\\" might cause younger readers some concern).	2002-11-22

Books	5	9	9	N	N	*LOVE* this book	I never wanted to find out why my pubic hair was curly until my grandmother bought me this book, choosing, as I did, like most well balanced people do, to shave off said hair with my father's clippers, but now, I'm fascinated. Join Vernon as he takes on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of pubic discovery, from the invention of pubic hair in the early 1600's (which was considered &quot;a lewde and evile poxxe on manne and beyste&quot; by the unwashed masses), to the production of the first merkin in 1798, through to the stockpiling of pubic hair during the Second World War. An unmissable addition to the serious book lover's collection. A timeless classic.	2002-11-22

I, for one, find body hair of any description totally abhorrent, so I found this book one of the most difficult and challenging reads of my life. Peterkin's description of hair follicles, for example, borders, at times, on the pornographic.<br />I had to skip the chapter where he waxes lyrical about the curl-to-density ratio of pubic hair because I became too nauseous to carry on reading.	2002-11-22
