It is a big, beautiful book, but it is superficial and skin deep.  Rykwert's essay, while competent, is brief.  The photographs are beautiful, however the graphics (plans and sections) that are so essential to understanding Kahn's work are almost non-existent. Most projects contain only one floor plan that is usually \\"floating\\", i.e. devoid of any context.  There are no sections or elevations.  Seldom is there a site plan.  If you have all or most of the books on Kahn and feel you need another, then perhaps this book is for you.  If you are looking for a nice Kahn coffee table book, this book is for you.  If you are looking for an in-depth understanding of this master architect, than I suggest other sources, such as the MoCA \\"In the <BR>rhealm of architecture\\" catalogue published back in 1991.	2004-03-15

Burnham: Visionary Architect and Planner	Books	2	38	41	N	N	Beautiful, but Brief	A monograph on Chicago architect and planner Daniel Burnham is well over due.  This is a big, beautiful book that has recent color photos of many of his major works.  That being said, the book also has many shortcomings.  The essay is relatively brief.  There are no illustrations of Burnham &amp; Root's earlier works such as the houses and commuter train stations that gave the firm its start.  There's not even an illustration of the Montauk Building, known by many as the first skyscraper.  There are very few plans and no sections or details (Wouldn't it be great to see a wall section of the Manadnock Building?).  There is no building chronology, such as that contained in Thomas Hines Book.  This is an expensive book, and for $95.00 (or even the reduced Amazon price) I would expect that this would be the one and only source book necessary for the study of Daniel Burnham. Unfortunately it's not.  If you want a big picture book of Daniel Burnham's work, this is the book.  If you want a more scholarly study, I suggest Thomas Hines &quot;Burnham of Chicago&quot;.	2003-10-25

Most of these projects are what I term avante garde, or object like home additions, meaning that the new portion of the building relates to, but does not necessarily match the existing building.  It is interesting to compare and contrast this book to Taunton Press' \\"Design Ideas for Great American Houses - Additions\\" which features more conservatively designed seamless additions - also an excellent addition sourcebook.<br />Most of the projects are designed by seasoned and up and coming young architects.  In most cases there is a display of exceptional rigor, which makes these projects very unpredictable.  Most projects employ superb craftsmanship.  The book's large format makes a beautiful presentation of these projects.  As the owner of an architectural firm that does a lot of additions, I found this book to be a great inspiration and highly recommend it.	2003-10-25

After seeing Furness' magnificent Academy of Fine Arts and U of Penn Library, I felt the need to get to know the architect and his seminal works better.<br />Although there are some scholarly essays in this book and it may be the best source available on this master architect, I must say I am disappointed that the authors chose to feature &quot;more than 670 projects through 700 drawings and photographs&quot;.  Does the student of Furness really need to know every single building the architect completed regardless of its design merit?  Or would others and I be better served seeing his more seminal, and perhaps lesser-known quality buildings in a more in-depth manner?  The book tantalizes the reader with 14 color plates, and then presents ALL of the architects work with old, grainy photographs in an often times confusing catalogue.  Even the seminal works don't have the depth (plans, sections, details, recent photos) that would benefit the reader.  This book is a missed opportunity.	2003-10-25

This book is a study in which the author traces the development of ornamentation influenced in nature patterns.  The book shows how Sullivan's ornamentation was passed down to his former employees (an excellent study in its own right).  And finally how terra cotta ornament became massed produced and used by lesser-known architects for the development of a Chicago &quot;Sullivanesque&quot; Vernacular.  <br />This is a very thorough book that will appeal to students of The Arts &amp; Crafts/Prairie School and &quot;vernacular urban architecture&quot; which has all but been ignored by architects and academics.  The book contains numerous photographs.  There is a great chapter on Sullivan's disciples, and, as mentioned before, the work of lesser-known &quot;blue collar&quot; architects whose background buildings are great contributions to the city of Chicago. There is also an appendix which contains an exhaustive, state by state inventory of Sullivanesque buildings.	2003-10-25

This book brings together twenty-five projects that have been featured in Fine Homebuilding magazine over the past five years.  The additions range in scale form major complete home makeovers to small additions/remodelings such as adding a portico to a Georgian Colonial home.  The projects are classified in terms of &quot;Adding Up, Adding on the Side, Adding On, and Adding Out.  <br />These projects are mostly what I term &quot;Seamless&quot; additions, meaning that the addition/makeover/remodeling is done in a manner to create a seamless (oftentimes altogether new) building.  Most of the projects featured are architect designed and all display a fine level of craftsmanship and inginuity that one expects from Fine Homebuilding Magazine.  It is interesting to compare this book with James Grayson Truelove's book &quot;New American Additions and Remodelings&quot;.  Truelove's book, which I also highly recommend, features more avante garde, object-like projects, many by noted young architects.<br />This is a paperback book and the articles are have been very nicely repackaged.  Whether you are an architect, contractor, or homeowner, I highly recommend this book.	2003-10-25

The book competently chronicles Soriano's career and major projects.  However it achieves much more: There is an excellent introductory essay (The Postwar Dream Takes Hold) on the post WWII housing boom and specifically on the typology of the modern California House.  This background introduces the reader to the spirit of the era in which Soriano established his practice.  <br />The second essay, entitle Pioneering Steel Houses 1935-1970 focuses on Soriano's career and his strong convictions of the steel frame used as a vehicle to meet the demand of the housing boom.   The photos, mostly by noted photographer Julius Shulman are crisp and clear.  While it would be nice to see recent photos of Sauriano's structures, the author is clear to point out that most of Soriano's buildings have sadly been demolished or altered beyond recognition.  <br />The two essays are followed by a very thorough catalogue with commentary of all Soriano's projects.  The book also contains a map of Soriano's projects in Los Angeles, a Chronology of the Architect's life, and finally the typescript of Soriano's unfinished autobiography (all of about 5 typewritten pages).<br />I highly recommend this book for the student of mid-century modernism.	2002-12-07

The book contains sixteen, excellently crafted homes with superb photography. The houses are organized into 4 categories: Timber, Steel, Concrete, and Masonry. The drawings (building/wall sections, plan details) are very clear and reveal some hidden truths. The book also contains three short essays (Single family house: Myth and Reality; A Small House with a Garden; The Image of the House) that are equally as inspiring. <br />Yes, these are high-end, avant-garde, mostly European homes as the previous reviewer has pointed out. But, Isn't this the type of book us more conventional architects should be getting our inspiration from? Perhaps some of these elegant details and constructs could trickle down into conventional residential practice, even speculative housing. If every residential architect were to study these types of details and enlighten their clients, I'm sure the quality of the built environment would improve. Let's broaden our horizons.	2002-07-07

The original black and white photos are as crisp as the planar fascias and walls of Jones' many projects represented here. The graphics, (mostly plans and perspective renderings) are reproduced in a sepia tone that wonderfully invokes the spirit of the post WW2 period. And, in this age of neo-modernism, it is great to be exposed to a talented, true modernist whose architecture was not influenced by the latest fads and trends, but by the architect's deep convictions of modern architecture improving the quality of life. <br />The book contains a short essay and a catalogue of about 65 of Jones (and his partner Frederick Emmons) projects. The projects are shown chronologically in seven categories: Single-Family Houses; Residential Housing Developments; Churches; Commercial Spaces; Civic Spaces; University Buildings; and Planning Work. <br />The essay entitled Building for Better Living: The Architecture of A. Quincy Jones, is however, disappointingly brief. Although it begins in a biographical format, it moves quickly into Jones' theories on multi and single-family residential development. It then discusses Jones' design methods and uses of materials, and concludes abruptly with Earth Structures & Energy Systems and Planning & Landscape Designs. Very little is mentioned in regard to his practice and the fact that Jones and Emmons were awarded national AIA Firm of the Year in 1969. The essay makes no mention when and how Jones died.<br />Jones' plans are a work of art, not just graphically, but in regards to the rigor in which he was able to make space and structure flow and integrate his buildings into the California landscape. It is unfortunate that only about a third of the projects in this book contain plans. Still, there are some stunning projects represented here. I highly recommend this book to the serious student of mid-century modernism.	2002-06-05

It is authored by a woman who married into the Garton Toy Company of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.  Garton was one of &quot;the Big 4&quot; in the manufacturing of pedal cars.  The book begins with an introduction on pedal cars followed by a chapter on the Art of the Juvenile Automobile, highlighting the careers of the various designers and what inspired their designs.  There are four chapters on each of the prominant pedal car manufacturers (Garton, Murray, Gendron, and AMF/BMC).  And finally two chapters on collectors and collections.  The last chapter contains a source page (publications, places, events, etc.)  The text is interesting and informative, however, its the color photos (aprox. 550) that will make your mouth water.  If I had to choose one book on pedal cars, this would be the one.	2002-05-11

It is a good book written in a clear, concise way that accomplishes what most other books on this master architect have not been able to - in that it is a well rounded book that addresses the many facets of schindler's life and practice. <br />Sheine's book traces the architect's Austrian upbringing and schooling (Wagner and Loos) and Schindler's fascination with Wright. It interestingly compares the two architects and asks which was the first 'space architect'? Sheine elaborates on Schindler's theory of 'Space Architecture and the 'Schindler Frame' and classifies his work in four phases (Concrete and Radicalism; Plaster Skin Design; Experiments with materials and roof forms; and the Schindler Frame and translucency). She also addresses the architect's omission from the International Style exhibit and argues that his work, in fact, had no place in it. The book has a great chapter on his practice methods and concludes with chapters on his influence and reputation and the recognition that Schindler has received since his death in 1953. <br />Sheine's writing style is most competent as she writes as someone whom seems to intimately know the architect. Although this is not true, the author has lived in a Schindler building and has passionately pursued getting to know Schindler's life and architecture.<br />I have most of the books on Schindler, and this is my favorite one. Unfortunately, I could not give it 5 stars as Phaidon missed an opportunity with this 8x8 book format. The photos don't read very well and the plan and section diagrams, which are so essential to understanding Schindler's work, are postage stamp size. Still, If I had to choose one Schindler book, this would be the one.	2002-04-11

Books	5	8	8	N	N	Doing Good Architecture	This is a big, beautiful book portraying the works of an architect who strived not to design monuments with a signature style, but instead create wonderful places that fit their landscape.  The book chronicles twenty of Turnbull's projects beginning with the Sea Ranch Condominium (with MLTW) and ending with Turnbull and his wife's own weekend retreat, Teviot Springs Vineyard.  All but one of the projects (Sea Ranch Athletic Club)are residential, which reflects the nature of Turnbull's career.  The book contains essays by Mary Griffen (Turnbull's wife and business partner), William Stout, Mitchell Schwarzer, and Donlyn Lyndon.  Turnbull's buildings contain innate beauty, sensitivity to site, and the ability to bring common, conventional construction to a high art.  Morley Baer's black and white photography is powerful and captures the wonderful subtleties in Turnbull's sometines simple and conventional structures that are truly &quot;GOOD&quot; architecture.	2001-09-29

Roughly half of the homes are located in the united states, with three by architect David Salmela in Minnesota and one in Michigan (Brininstool + Lynch Architects) - not exactly what American's refer to as mountainous regions. Some of the other architects featured include:  James Cutler, Hariri &amp; Hiriri, Eduardo Sauto de Moura, Alfedo DiVito, Fernau &amp; Hartman, and Frank Harman.  Most of the homes contemporary and woodsy and some, such as Salmela's, employ a regional vernacular.  The photos are excellent and clear.  Almost all the featured homes have floor plans.  A disappointment is that few have site plans or site sections - which I find helpful to the understanding of a 'mountain house'.  Although the title may at times be deceptive, this is a beautiful book at a fair price.  Until somebody writes a monograph on the Northwoods best kept secret - David Salmela (and I do hope somebody does) - This is one of the best sources of his work.	2001-08-12

The time (1946-66) was when America was in a building boom, the public wanted fresh, clean designs.  Sarasota was a growing town and Modern Architecture was going to change the world.  The Father of it all was an architect named Ralph Twitchell.  In 1940 Twitchell hired a young intern architect named Paul Rudolph.  Rudolph would go onto Harvard GSD, serve in the Navy and return to Sarastoa in 1946, and then become Twitchell's partner in 1950. The two of them, with a group of other talented architects (most notably Victor Lundy) would go on to design some extraordinary custom homes, churches and schools.  Their architecture stressed the tectonic (the use of new technologies).  Although the Sarasota aesthetic was in similar vein to the California post- war architecture, it also was heavily derivative of a Florida vernacular architecture.  Rudolph's early philosophy stressed five points:  the Clarity of construction; Maximum economy of means; Simple overall volumes penetrating vertically and horizontally; Clear geometry floating above the Florida Landscape; Honesty in details and in structural connections.  It is always a treat to see his pen and ink renderings.  A must for the serious student of modernism.	2001-07-31

It is an excellent sourcebook for those intersted in post war residential architecture.  Modern Architecture (with a capital A) was going to change the world, as these bold case-study house designs show.  This book contains a great deal more than just documenting the Case Study Building Program of the 50's.  There are essays by noted historians Esther McCoy, Thomas Hines and Reyner Banham and others as well.  These essays provide the background for the case study program and the mood of the public (especially in Califonia) after WW2.  There is also an essay on publisher Joh Estnza and the Arts and Architecture Magazine that sponsored the program.  The last chapter &quot;Extending the Case Study Concept&quot; documents the exhibit of six new designs (1987) commisioned by the Museum for a multi family housing project.  Architects include:  Eric Owen Moss, Toyo Ito and Hogetts &amp; Fung.  Lastly there are bio's on the architects, a timeline of events for the program and resourcefull bibliography.  As always, the Julious Shulman photographs are stunning.  This is a must have for the student of Modernism.	2001-07-24

Two chapters complete the book with the architect's own words on his design process and organic architecture.  The book contains plans, sections, photos and some detail drawings of some of Jones more noted projects and furniture pieces.  It is small book of only 94 pages.

Reiff traces the devlopment of pattern books first coming from Europe (Palladio, Serlio) and then evolving into Armerican Pattern Books (Asher Benjamin, A. J. Downing) and finally the history of plan catalogues by architects, lumber yards and majot retailors, such as Sears Reobuck.  The book shows how houses built from these sources sometimes deviated from their plans.  Also, many times the plan books merely influenced builders who drew their own plans more or less pirated from these sources. Reiff traces many built examples of houses that have their roots in these sources - sometimes litterally and other times suggestively.<br />Houses from books also contains an interesting chapter on the development and influence of architectural journals.  There is also a chapter of the influence of pattern books and catologue houses in an actual town using the authors home town of Fredonia, New York.  <br />In many ways this is a wonderful book, and if there is one source book I would recommend for the study of these topics, this would be it.  My only critisism is that the reading can at time be laborious.  The author has a tendancy to describe subtle nuances of houses in great detail.  Sometimes an illustration accompanies the text, other times there is none.  Because of this I often found myself a bit frustrated trying to figure out just what the author is trying to get accross.  That set asside, it is still an excellent, scholarly work.  The bonus feature of this book is its eight Appendices that contain listings of pattern and catologue books by companies, individuals, construction details, etc.  This is an invaluable source for the student of vernacular architecture.	2001-07-22

The  author skips over biographical data on the architect, such as birth,  upbringing, family life etc. and instead presents the reader with a  concise, competent essay on Schidler's place in Early Twentieth Century  architecture.  The essay shows how Schindler was influenced by his mentors  and peers such as Loos, Wright, Nuetra, and Irving Gill.  It also touches  on Schindler's rejection from Johnson and Hitchcock's International Style  exhibit.  <br />The second part of the book - selected works - presents the  reader with thirty-two of the architect's built works in a chronological  order.  The selected projects include twenty-five houses, six apartment  buildings/complexes and a Baptist church.  Each work contains a brief  description.  About half the projects contain color photos.  These appear  to be recent photos and include many interior shots.  Some projects, such  as the Kings Road House and the Wolfe Residence contain reproduced color  drawings (plans, sections, elevations) There are also a few renderings,  color and b/w.  Other projects are, disappointedly, not given proper  attention.  The Lovell Beach House, considered by many to be Schindler's  masterpiece does not have the plans and section that are so essential to  the understandingof this seminal structure.  One project, The Grokowski  Residence, contains only one, small black and white photo - not sufficient  to give an adequate description.  <br />The book also contains a map of L.A.  with the architect's projects pin-pointed and a brief biography at the end.  There is no bibliography that could point the serious scholar to additional  sources, nor does the book contain any of Schindler's writings.<br />THE  BOTTOM LINE This book contains nice color photos - some apparently  previously unpublished, some good graphic resources.  It is not a deep  book, however it can be a nice compliment to previously published work on  this master architect/builder.	2000-04-20
