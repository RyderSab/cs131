US	33556691	R11MBHW7ACI04X	0425188809	50861192	Watchers	Books	5	0	3	N	N	Maybe the best in this genre	To say I enjoyed this book would be a gross understatement. It is still - after all this time - the best book Dean Koontz ever wrote.  It has everything  - the evil, mad scientist, the nice guy, the woman who comes out of her shell and the greatest dog in the Universe.<br />The pages where he first meets Einstein and both he and the reader were given clues as to his uniqueness were awesome.  I finally stayed up all one Friday night to finish the thing. Nora underwent a tremendous transformation and her love with Travis was a thing of beauty.  <br />For once, Dean does not star the bad guy but relegates him to second page.  It is Travis, Nora and Einstein who take center stage.  Two movies were made from this - the first, one of the most abhorant piece of film ever presented, the other a poor representation of the book.  It's like presenting War &amp; Peace in three 20 minute installments. This is perfection.	2003-10-24

The suspense, the mood, the writing all contribute to that feeling you have when you are reading by yourlself and you are suddenly slightly apprehensive about looking around. <br />The idea is quite original - the mass disappearance of an entire town and just walking through the place raises the hair on your head. The appearance of the bodies, the weird pervading doom, it was all very well done.  I have not seen the movie but have heard good things about it.	2003-10-24

Somehow Koontz escaped the problems that have plagued him in his most recent books - repetition, boring characters, dull plots.<BR>This one is a real winner.	2003-10-24
US	33556691	RYV5BMIO4I009	0425181111	742127435	Strangers	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Part of the Trinity	Along with Watchers and Lightning, this book forms the top tier of Koont's writing. It was the first book of his I ever read and remains a favorite to this day.  The eerie writing, the mood, the question of what in the world is making people act as they do is presented with arching suspense.  This is not in his usual horror genre but is more a science fiction mystery.<br />I gave it a five even though the characterization was slightly weaker than in the other two - maybe it should get a 4.9.  But that moment of revelation was worth all the wait.	2003-10-24

The mood, the story, the characters, the castle, I liked it all.<br />This Dracula is not the violent, blood-thirsty monster featured in so many of these types of movies.  Instead, Gary Oldham (what a selection!) is the dark, sensuous eternal phantom, at once mesmerizing and intoxicating.  The trick of using a diary is especially effective in this case in that it gives the story some structure.  Even Keanu Reeves was good as the helpless husband.	2003-10-24

It was, in its own way, just as harrowing and frightening as WATCHERS or PHANTOMS. It's another Koontz favorite - the young lad with the older man. In this case its Colin's soon-to-be brother in law who takes him on a cross country relocation ride in the car.<br />Only someone is following them, threatening and closing in. It;s true that this is not as complex as others, or as long, and it does not have a love story (except by proxy) but it makes up for all of that with tense suspense and action.  This is a jewel - a miniature to be sure - but a real jewel.	2003-10-24

This is a story of such popes - those who led armies, who jocked for political position, who tortured, maimed, committed sacrilege so dreadful that it was only a whisper. <br />Yet, if one is a faithful Catholic, one would say that this is all just appearances - that they were REALLY the representative of Christ on Earth only they didn't act like it.  It seems they never asked that ubiquitous question, &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; It is hard to select the &quot;worst&quot; one...what is more awful - to massacre your opponent or to commit adultry on the throne?  To lead a slaughter of &quot;infidels&quot; or join with Earthly political powers.  Urban is a real winner, my candidate for Bad Pope of the Millenium but others are also listed.<br />This is not, by the way, an anti-Catholic tirade.  If anything, the Church can claim to be truly divinely blessed for having survived these creatures.	2003-10-24

No, they do not have the magic and the depth and the awe of the original but then I did not think I was going to get the exact message.<br />This book is not as bad as some have made out but it is nowhere near a 5 star category.  If the story of Norma had taken more center stage I would have considered a 4 or even 5 star.  But it was lost in the onslaught of the seemingly endless tales, and unlike the original series, these folks are not interesting enough to maintain your attention over the long haul.  The book seems to continually be in a rush - the chapters have been reduced to chapterettes and despite the excessive length, a lot of what is said was not necessary in the first place.<br />I, for one, am sickened and tired of all the torture.  I have got into the habit of skipping those parts but had to reread the section on Norma in order to understand her transformation.  Some of the characters were better left unintroduced - the good fighter (is he supposed to be the prototype for Duncan Idaho?), the brother-in-law of Serena, assorted friends and wives and lovers - too busy. Serena can whine all she wants - grow up!	2003-10-24

This book attempts a distillation and mostly succeeds because it captures the essense of the man who was simultaneously many things -  a complex, gentle person who became a persona.<br />For a long time he was defined by the equation E=MC2 but over time his other theoretical work has been explored (and many times dismissed) and more importantly, his early years and the ideas that emerged from that era have come more sharply into focus.  The author provides a wealth of data on the European life of Einstein which is interesting in itself.<br />The author waxes eloquently on the non-scientific side  of the man, the humanist that that the world knows today.  This is a beautiful, complete work covering all aspects of Einstein's life.	2003-10-24

The idea of the eternal vampire is an old one from Eastern Europe (originally from Egypt) and the joining of an actual person (Vlad the Impaler) with the legend set the stage for all that was to follow.<br />This book is in the form of a diary, surely one of the best mechanisms available when handled adroitly.  The slow seduction of Mina by the Count can be interpreted in a number of ways but the best way is left to the imagination.  There is always that ageless quandry - does one become a Vampire, lose one's soul, yet gain immortality?  Get the book - better than any of the current crop.	2003-10-24

Only in this case it is not middle-America suburbian married life that is being examined but poor Marcia and her gaggle of well-meaning relatives.  She is introduced to loser after loser until there he is one day.  <br />The sexual exploits combine with her amateur snooping to create a funny, intriguing book with characters as well-honed as the plot.  Isaacs has a way with words and specializes in dialogue of the funny sort.  I again laughed out loud over and over and the characters became almost like the people you meet daily.

Throughout the series he has tried to remain factually or scientifically correct such as the idea that huge dinosaurs could have never developed the brain size or build the structures required for their use and that without the devastating asteroid dinosaurs would have remained the rulers of Earth.   <br />We continue our adventures of the &quot;human boy&quot; who interacts with the dinosaur culture.  The dinosaurs are, in the end, simply prototypes of humans in their emotional and ethical outlook - some are good, others bad.  This is a good read.	2003-10-23

It's not the type of lifestyle that most of us aspire to but in Susan Isaac's hands it is absolutely hilarious.   This is one of the few books that made me laugh out loud - the word pictures created are too good for words.<br />IN fact, the whole tale - from plot to Jewish Angst to the heroine's thoughts -  are the stuff of best sellers.  I have a real attraction to those stories where the innocent bystander innocently becomes involves (and solves) a crime.  This is all done between soccer rides for kids and fixing dinner for her hubby.  (The movie was not nearly as good as the book but was still a hoot.)  Definite read.	2003-10-23

The most obvious contradiction, made evident in this stunning book, is that the garralous, &quot;life of the party&quot; was a genuinely private man.  As Peggy Noonan has noted so many times, Reagan, unlike many of the political and intellectual intelligensia, never claimed to be smarter, wiser or more knowledgable that the rest of us. <br />The art of letter writing is dying the way of the manual typewriter.  The fact that he wrote these thousands of letters by hand says something about the personal touch that he often exhibited.  More telling than that, though, was the diverse spectrum of recipients - from nurses to widows to students in grade school and high school to union employees to heads of state to his children.  And the range of subjects covered - from entertainment to religion to economics to literature to sports - showed a man who was interested in the whole of life.  The man who &quot;trusted America to do the right thing&quot; demonstrated that trust in his letters time after time.<br />While some may have disliked his policies on various subjects, few - except the diehards who we will unfortunatey always have with us - will dislike the man after reading this book.  The tribute by his daughter Patty was one of the greatest I have ever seen and demonstrated that she and her father have, at last, made peace.	2003-10-23

Following on the heels of the hilarious COMPROMISING POSITIONS and CLOSE RELATIONS, I expected another fast-paced tale of Jewish angst.  What I got instead was one of the most boring tales in the past 100 years with characters as forgettable as either the dialogue or plot.  <br />I kept thinking the whole thing was a joke - that at some point the heroine would look up from her desk and mutter how awful this stuff was, wad it up and see a dead body. But no such luck. Unfortunately Isaacs now appears to consider herself a &quot;serious&quot; writer which apparently to her means the same thing as &quot;boring&quot; writer. The story of love lost and found and lost (ad nauseum) is one that we have all seen and heard (and maybe experienced) many times. As the old saying goes, &quot;Nothing venturned, nothing gained&quot; and there was certainly nothing gained in this outing.	2003-10-23

(That little fact is rarely mentioned in all the praises to the &quot;worker's paradise&quot;.) It so happened that he memorized the entire range of equipment and capacity and was able to recite this back when it came time to compute how much Castro had looted.<br />This is an insider's story of the corporate world, the tensions and alliances, the rewards and penalties for both hard work and luck, the demonstration of the idea that if you work hard enough you can make it.  Goizuela's rise occurred amid an upheaval in the soft drink industry.  There was the disastrous &quot;New Coke&quot;, the challenge by Pepsi, the much-heralded secret formula, the   introduction of juices and water....all are featured in detail.<br />A great book about a great man - reading about his funeral had me grinning and whistling along.	2003-10-23

The story, characters, writing and dialogue were just \\"magical\\".  It is a truism that every book teaches something but the information gleaned from this story transcends the type - the facts about magic and police work are just astounding.<br />I am not sure which is better - the real characters or the convoluted, sleight of hand, but satisfactory plot.  First of all , the idea of a  quadraplegic detective indicates that this will be a cerebral tale and indeed that was the case.  There is remarkably little sex, violence, cursing, action for action's sake and in a way this makes the task all the more difficult.  The author must actually compose sentences and built a plot that are above mere superficiality.  <br />This is really three books in one - the first ends with the capture, the second ends with the capture (read and find out) and the third - the story of the female star - concludes this work.  It is difficult to describe what incredible writing and plotting this is.  The originality of the tale continues to haunt.	2003-07-23

Here it is in all its glory, triumph, personal pain, sacrifice and unbelievable scientific achievement: The Story of man's attempts to transcent these \\"earthly bounds.\\" <br />The characters are simply awesome - only word to explain.  The setting (mainly in Huntsville) was of particular interest since it was presented as a normal town - not as a \\"Southern\\" city with all that implies.   The story of the German scientists was captivating but the emotional heart of the story was the love story between the main character and his wife which survived the disappointing choices of his children and his profession.<br />The mixing of real and fictional characters (along with real and fictional places, i.e. Fremont) only added to the authenticity of the story.  Yes, there were some technical mistakes but these were nothing compared to the overall arch of the story.  <br />The repeated question, \\"What is the role of man in space?\\" was never really answered.  Speculations abound and it seems we will always have the \\"but we have so many problems on Earth\\" crowd with us.  In the end, this is not only a tribute but a requiem for a heroic era.<br />Needless to say, the television version was about as close to the book as a GI Joe action figure is to a real Marine.  The emphasis was on (what else?) SEX and all the little intrigues that seem to monopolize TV land.  The science, the wonder, the awe thatone found in, for example, CONTACT, was conspicuously absent.

The author excels in sustaining suspicion throughout the novel as we wonder if what we dare think could be true really is.  This is a tale that shimmers just beneath the surface where most of the action lies.<br />The only problem is the main character.  He never becomes as real as the other characters, perhaps due to his utterly boring persona.  Still, the story of Americans who just happened to be ancient gods who play scrabble, bowl and argue is captivating.  The earth-shaking finale has parallels with many others - Buffy the Vampire, Mortal Combat, X-Men - all, by the way, as American as apple pie.	2003-07-22

What an idea!!!  With all the reports popping up every day about the widespread lack of sleep in our society, this may be an idea whose time has arrived.<br />The author specializes in dialogue and thoughts and the tales of SMART (vs smarmy/hateful/creepy/sassy/whining) kids and their trials and tribulations was superbly written. It is difficult to imagine ordinary folks becoming agents of hate and revenge, but what lurks right under the veneer of civilization?  All in all, this was the superior of the series as is most often the case.  That does not mean that you should skip the others, and the author continually introduces new ideas and curve balls to keep the action flowing and suspense suspenseful.  The author also attempts what few sci-fi writers dare - a scientific explanation of the sci-fi within the book.  Grab the series for a long vacation read at the beach.	2003-07-18

I was expecting little vignettes of Company Life with the same roster of characters but the depth and variety of characters, settings and plots was stunning.  Maybe it is true that the short story - as opposed to the novel, poem, saga, chant or song - is the real American art form.  If so, then Ms. Baker has accepted the challenge with gusto.<br />The author is said to be a fan of the X-Files and in that show, one quickly grew tired of monsters and weirdos, yearning instead for the ever-changing, ever-evolving mythology which undergirded the series.  The Zeus books follow a similar pattern.  If &quot;The Garden of Iden&quot; is almost childlike - you might say innocent - the following tales evolved into philosophical treatises on the nature, reason and ultimate fate of time travel and, more than anything, the mysterious Chronos Corporation and its hidden agenda.     <br />These are splendid stories although it is imperative that one is first acquainted with the preceding novels to which they allude. The sequence seems random but one discovers a serial-like order of presentation.  The young lad with the extraordinary powers shows up several times and the attentive reader will discern both the hows and whys of his origin.  Some of these stories sound boring in the extreme until the first paragraph.  Suddenly you are caught in the web spun by the author and the only escape is finishing the tale.<br />Some are tongue-in-cheek (Lemuria), some are explanatory (Search for the Delacroix), others are reflective of the author's great interest in English history (Shakespeare).  All possess that unique &quot;Baker&quot; quality that permeates her works - the excellent turn of phrase, the fidelity to the character and the times, the occasional surprise and the relentless movement of the logic to its conclusions, tragic, maudlin or triumphant. Many of these could easily be developed into novels, a task I hope the author will undertake in the future.	2003-07-15

This work on Alexander gives us a glimpse of the evolution of Fox's writing as well as his views on the subject which are still fresh and surprisingly valid after all these years.<br />As usual, Fox examines and refers to numerous ancient document, customs of the times, differences in languages and somehow makes clear to the reader even the most confusing of subjects, such as the interplay between clans, tribes, family and nationalities. What is so remarkable about this writing is the universal quality of the prose along with the surprising but perfectly valid conclusions.<br />Many historians seem afraid to offer conjecture or opinions but Fox has deliberately gone out on a limb several times - for example, his conclusion that John, the last Gospel penned, was actually the closest to the the original sources.  In this book we are given a picture of the life and times of one of the most influential person in history - as much for what he stood for as what he accomplished.

First of all, this is a well-written, well-documented story that is equal parts history and agitprop. The author, a \\"former\\" communist (the prefix is now a requisite), attempts to give a definitive history of Leftist politics in this nation.  That is - and this ia a big \\"That is\\"  - if you assign to a variety of historical national impulses the term \\"left\\".<br />The author stresses that Socialism is not an alien movement but is as patriotic as Old Glory and in one sense he is right.  American Socialism never advocated the type of authoritarianism found elsewhere when Socialism was imposed - whether in the USSR, Africa, Asia or Cuba. Western Socialists refused to address the major problem - someone must persuade citizens who do not want the \\"benefits\\" of Socialism and this must be done through the use of force. The book is best in the historical sagas, worst in its ideological cant: good reading / bad pleading.  <br />It may have been a native movement but it ran against the grain of America's historical preference of tradition and experience over newness and theory. For a while it seemed that a genuine movement was eminent but, according to Weinstein, events always intervened and set back the movement. Socialism was unsuccessful in America for four reasons that the author discusses in varying degrees of detail:<br />(1) Socialism's adherants were permanently temporary. The poor got wealth, students alienated the middle class, farmers hated state control and unions rejected the idea leaving academia - the one place that still takes Socialism seriously.<BR>(2) Socialism was morally discredited due to its fervent support of  Stalin and other dicatatorships. We hear again about how the the USSR didn't practice \\"true\\" Socialism.<BR>(3) Socialism became synonymous with poverty because, well, all Socialist states remained poor and that is not a vision to which Americans aspire.  <BR>(4) Socialism never offered a viable alternative that insured wealth, choice, opportunity and a positive vision of the future. Its negative agenda (looting and redistributing wealth, control of production, implementation of social engineering schemes) were rejected out of hand.<br />As my former professor used to say, you have provided a lot of answers but no solution.  To counter capitalism's argument that you can work and gain wealth, Socialism offers the appeal of an egalitarian society - where some are more equal than others. It did not work in the past and will probably not work in the future	2003-07-09

They are like a Symphony in which every movement is a variation of the same theme.  That being said, each is a good reads.<br />The author knows the details of the Gospels better than 99% of most preachers.  He also knows the historical setting, the language and cultural landscape.  While I may or may not agree that a historical person existed from whom a religion emanated, I will agree that there is no evidence (besides the Bible) that a &quot;God&quot; lived in Palestine, rose from the dead and ascended to his new home in the clouds. <br />Wells has made the same arguments numerous times - Paul wrote before the Gospels and knew nothing of a historical Jesus, the Gospels began the biography of the Messiah and each succeeding Gospel not only grew more elaborate but harkened back further in time.  Mark started at the Baptism, Mathew and Luke at the birth and John at the beginning of time. There are no valid historical documents on this person which seems strange if folks were raised from the dead or made to walk or 5,000 people were fed from a small lunch.<br />I should add that Wells is extremely fair and even empathetic to his scholastic foes.  He is always respectful, never crude or angry.  He even allows them to speak in their own words before demolishing their argument.  Get one of the books and enjoy.	2003-07-07

But this one takes the cake.  Why oh why do so many of these writers become enamored of enormous conspiracies that involve structures and plots so convoluted it would take an army of ciphers to dissect them?<br />Here's the latest: Christianity is all about a sacred mushroom.  While thousands were being martyred for a new faith, their real thoughts were on a lowly plant.  Or by that time, maybe the fake story (Jesus) had replaced the real story (mushrooms with a kick) or who knows? This has to be one of the worst pieces of pseudo-scholarship combined with an idea from left field I have ever attempted to wade through.  I actually had to check out the book from the library because I was laughing so hard.<br />I am convinced that Allegro wrote this under the influence of his favorite subject. The \\"evidence\\" is one of those things that you have to connect to something else that connects to ....  you get the picture.  Avoid it like the plague.	2003-07-07

The writer is the face of Western humanism and his Jewish Italian roots seem to make him almost humble in tone.  The idea of naming each chapter after an element then creating a life story around it is exactly the kind of writing I search for.  <br />Besides dispening some scientific facts along the way, Levi teaches us the meaning of life and living and even humor.  One of the best and most approachable \\"science\\" books around.	2003-07-07

One one side are philosophers, professors, psychologists and ex-churchmen writing storms of \\"myth\\" books only to be countered by archeologists, theologians and divinity professors on the \\"He existed\\" side.  Strangely, no other religion has worked so hard nor stressed so fervently the historicity of its founder as Christianity. My own thoughts are that a series of events brought this Jewish sect to its current state - there were certainly no magin mushroom, secret advisor or high level Roman conspiracy to start a new religion.<br />This \\"non-fiction\\" tale talks of mystical numbers, symbols, Asian run-ins, Buddha and other unlikely characters rolled into an unholy mishmash of conjecture and conclusions. What is this great need for conspiracies, gnosticism, and Eastern mysticism?  At least we doesn't have JESUS taking a vacation to France with Mary Magdelene and child as seems currenly in vogue in some circles.<br />As long as we have questions about the personhood of Jesus we will be beset with exaggerated, farfetched tales introducing big behind the scenes moves.  The idea of evolutionary growth of an idea seems to have escaped these folks.  Try one of Well's excellent books or even Robin Lane Fox's great works.	2003-07-07

In fact, I remember checking it from the library a few days after seeing &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.  I was (and am) such a fan of time travel tales.  Although Asimov has won kudos for his volumnious works over the years, I've always found him somewhat less than appealing.  It seems the plot is always for better than the other elements and the romance is, well, unromantic. His characters are often sterile - more portrait than flesh and blood.    <br />But this novel is something different - a work in which the story, characters and action move along to a surprising ending. The pace of the tale is perfection itself, not too rushed or caught up in non-essential happenings.  The romance is, as usual, almost chaste in its presentation but surprisingly deep. Rereading it after all these years still brings pleasure even if it is a tad dated.  <br />All the paradoxes and what-ifs of time travel are present (the idea of &quot;self-protection&quot; from time changes while in the machine is a stroke of genius).  The various twists and turns make for an enjoyable read. Do yourself a favor and get the book.	2003-07-06
US	33556691	R327SZNXZB2G5F	0140126392	178443763	Future Stuff	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Fun read	This is a fun book - full of short tales of inventions which may or may not affect the future.  I first read it in 1990 and at a  second glance recently I noticed how tame the predictions were. Most were consumer-oriented items or fantasy ideas (floating furniture for easy cleaning) but several have become reality - stitches that fade, food wrappings that one can eat, windows that lighten or darken or allow more or less heat into a room.<br />The organization is simple - a few chapters with small vignettes about the product accompanied by a drawing of same.  Of added interest were two additional items:  Predictions of when the product would appear and the percent chance of its development.	2003-07-06
US	33556691	R3OGZL5PC9TILV	0440236738	734473825	Gone for Good	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A few flaws in a good read	This mystery captures the attention of the reader from the first page and manages to hold it throughout the book despite that annoying habit of jumping from scene to scene with each chapter. The story was allowed to work itself out and it came back on itself in the end - almost like a Mobius strip.<br />The biggest flaw was a commmon one in mystery writing - all the assumptions of the characters were proved invalid by events to which the reader had no access.  In a sense it reminds one of the Soaps where the problem is resolved by the sudden appearance of the unknown twin who has just woken from a 15 year state of amnesia.   This is not quite as bad but [CAUTION:  STORY NOTES FOLLOW] when the sister suddenly steps out from behind the buses to tell the world the long-hidden truth and John shows up to add his version of the truth about Carly (it DOES sound like a soap) the reader can rightly call \\"Foul\\".  <br />Stories with last page resolutions are a dime a dozen and in this case it's sad.  The plot was well-conceived even if the main character was memorable if only for his Mr. Rogerslike manner. He remained a neutral, gray, handicapped figure who just didn't \\"get it\\" even when it was as plain as Aunt Sally's dress.  <br />Plot - A<BR>Setting - C<BR>Characters - C  (the bad guy ets a B)  <BR>Dialogue - B (witty at times)<BR>Resolution - D<br />Great for a vacation	2003-07-05
