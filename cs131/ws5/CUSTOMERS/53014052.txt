I found THE SKY'S THE LIMIT to be a fascinating book. For anyone with an interest in the history of Manhattan real estate, it's a primer.    Gaines is both an excellent writer and an excellent researcher. He takes a topic that easily could be dull and brings it to life.    THE SKY'S THE LIMIT is a well-organized and thorough explanation of land use in New York, tracking the long history of a city which always has walked to its very own drummer.    All of the book is riveting and some parts are downright funny; a quote by a former mistress of impressario Flo Ziegfield is hilarious.    There are three glaring errors, not so many considering the thousands of little-known facts that Gaines offers. Still, he has a complete, 180 degree misunderstanding of the concept of \\"open listing\\" in offering a real estate listing for sale through a brokerage, confusing it with an \\"exclusive listing,\\" a term which he doesn't explicate.     And he claims that a certain real estate broker renowned in the New York area had once lived in Eygpt, which was where--according to Gaines--she had learned to read \\"Arabic numbers.\\"    These are quibbles, however, of an overall work that is compelling and valuable. Altogether, reading this book is time well-spent, and Steven Gaines is to be complimented.	2005-09-18

The most obvious limitation of the romance genre is that the story, inevitably, is so linear, going ultimately to \\"happily-ever-after.\\" This being the case, it is the journey, and not the destination, which makes these novels so much fun. <br /> <br />Susan Elizabeth Phillips, or \\"SEP\\" to her most devoted fans, is the current grande dame of this genre. No one writes a better romance than she does--hence her consistent successes. <br /> <br />MATCH ME IF YOU CAN has all of the hallmarks of a SEP book: clever plot, funny twists, terrific dialogue and one of the more endearing heroines in recent memory. <br /> <br />Nobody does it better than SEP, not with clever repartee and engrossing characters, alpha males and touching heroines. <br /> <br />For fans of the author, MATCH ME IF YOU CAN will not disappoint. For new readers of her work, it will make a swell introduction.	2005-08-30
US	53014052	R29F2QF8D3LQVR	0312336926	849329973	Snobs	Books	3	4	9	N	Y	Uneven but entertaining	Author Julian Fellowes is a man of many talents, including a sharp eye and a well-developed ear. <br /> <br />In SNOBS, he has written a novel that is entertaining and even thought-provoking. It is light as air, however and, ultimately, it leaves one flat. <br /> <br />The book is peculiarly edited, perhaps a deliberate choice as a matter of style. There's a lack of commas that can be offputting, a narrative that changes from first-person to third-person, and fragments masquerading as sentences. <br /> <br />This is not to say that the book is without merit. The acute eyes and ears of the author allow him to transmit a sense of what it means to be a member of the British aristocracy, as he appears to know their rhythms inside-out.  <br /> <br />Similarly, he is blessed with insights into human nature that are piercing and clear. <br /> <br />All of this combines to create an interesting background to his story. It is the plot itself, though, that is too simplistic, too uncomplicated and too predictable. This dooms the novel to falling flat as a worthwhile read. <br /> <br />Many, many books using the device of a narrator succeed better than Fellowes does here, from THE GREAT GATSBY to the Archy McNally series of mysteries set in Palm Beach. <br /> <br />Still, at it's best, SNOBS is informative as well as fun--and there's never anything wrong with having fun.	2005-08-25

Her prose is exquisite, and her scholarship is of the highest order.    These two aspects of her writing couple to enable her to create historical fiction of the strictest standards of accuracy.    THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is an account of the courtship of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn--though, actually, Anne courted Henry--of Anne's reign as his queen, and of Anne's eventual denouement, all purportedly reported by Anne's only sister. In fact, it is ambiguous whether the \\"other\\" girl of the title refers to the sister or to Anne herself.    Writing in the first person, Gregory's knowledge is so detailed that the reader truly can believe that this book is a contemporaneous account. It seems as if THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL easily could have been written during the 16th century, though the language actually is modern.    Philippa Gregory is one of the finest authors of historic fiction ever to have been published, and one never can go wrong reading one of her books.	2005-08-25

This unusual and superior combination of elements have turned her novels into great--and deserved--successes. THE UNDOMESTIC GODDESS is no exception to the author's personal formula for excellence.	2005-07-31

This is a beautifully written book, and author Jean Hanff Korelitz is to be congratulated. <br /> <br />The story is rich and complex. There are a variety of plots and subplots, each of which is compelling enough to be the center of its own novel. <br /> <br />The story gets off to a slow start, which serves neither the author nor her readers well. Yet once one immerses oneself in these characters, THE WHITE ROSE is touching and gripping. <br /> <br />There are a multitude of love affairs described, with excellent descriptions of passion. <br /> <br />There are different versions of the story of the White Rose, including the real one about a small group of upper class Germans who resisted the Nazis. <br /> <br />There are details about the highest levels of academia and scholarship, and about the lifestyles of those New Yorkers who, quietly and without ostentation, are very, very rich. <br /> <br />THE WHITE ROSE is filled with amazing insights, so incisive and so clear that these literally are breathtaking. <br /> <br />The only quibbles go to the author's descriptions of cooking. In one scene, on a day she describes as warm, a character puts on a tweed jacket and necktie to reduce a sauce and boil some pasta. Please! Who wears wool to labor over a hot stove? In another scene, a different character cooks a brisket in less than an hour. It takes more than an hour simply to prep a brisket, and the cooking needs four to six hours. Didn't anyone associated with the manuscript--author, agent, editor--have a clue? <br /> <br />The other issue is the author's sense of direction. The route she suggests using between Manhattan and East Hampton is preposterous. Once again, this weird discrepancy stops the lovely flow of her story. <br /> <br />Yet as a book, THE WHITE ROSE is the finest use of the metaphor of the rose as an example both of the life cycle and a thing of pure beauty since the excellent novel THE ROSE GROWER was published in 2000. <br /> <br />THE WHITE ROSE is a perfect bloom.	2005-06-11

And does every one of them find true love in that country? <br /> <br />There have been too many similar books published just ahead of this one for there to be anything innovative about the theme here. <br /> <br />And author Laura Fraser has written this book entirely in the second person, like a beauty article in a hackneyed women's magazine. (The whole work scans to, \\"First, you take an egg and you mix in a bit of good olive oil, then you spread it on your face.\\"\\") After a couple of pages, boy, does this self-conscious styling get tiring! <br /> <br />I cannot agree with the majority of other Amazon readers who posted complimentary reviews about this book; I found AN ITALIAN AFFAIR to be predictable, stilted and, altogether, a waste of time.	2005-06-11

After completing the novel, I cannot help pondering what the point of the book may be. <br /> <br />Certainly, Wolfe is a skilled writer, and his skills are obvious even in I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS. His ear for voices and dialect shows through, and his complicated subplot structure is here too, if not as complicated as in his earlier works. <br /> <br />Still, I keep wondering what propelled Wolfe to tell this particular tale--in which the story begins with a detailed description of bowel movements.  <br /> <br />Other than the title character, those who populate this novel are uniformly unlikeable. So what if Wolfe gets teenspeak or athletespeak or even blackspeak?  <br /> <br />All of Wolfe's skills merge together to form this unpleasant and uninteresting novel. What a waste of talent! I will not be buying his future books.	2005-05-07

At the center of the plot is a Christian icon which was housed, for centuries, in the church of a tiny village that is overrun by the Germans during World War II. <br /> <br />There are mysteries raised at the beginning of this novel that must be revealed for the ending to make sense. Who were the Greek partisans, and who among them survived the Nazis? Did the icon survive, too--or was it destroyed, or stolen? And, if the latter, who ended up owning the icon? Did the Nazis plunder it? Finally,did the icon ever have the power to actually heal the sick? <br /> <br />All of these mysteries are set in a fast-paced, gripping story that will please fans of the genre of thrillers. Olsen's career as an author is off to an impressive start.	2005-05-06

While one should not judge a book by its cover, this rule apparently does not apply to names.  ANGRY HOUSEWIVES fully lived up to its promise. <br /> <br />Using a five-member book club as a spine, Lorna Landvik's novel tells the various stories of these women. Spanning five decades, the choices of the books that they read--and these choices are shared with the readers of ANGRY HOUSEWIVES--reflect the interests and the moods of the club members in particular and the whole country in general. <br /> <br />We all get to re-live the women's liberation movement, now taken for granted almost a half-century later, and the anti-war feeling that enveloped much of the country during the Vietnam conflict. <br /> <br />In fairness, this book goes a bit longer than necessary and, in consequence, it becomes not quite as commanding as a shorter version might have been.  And, on reflection, one or two of the main characters seem stereotypical, but this may be a fair reflection of society in general. People do, indeed, fit certain profiles. <br /> <br />Overall, however, Landvik has written a touching book about life changes and personal growth, and a book that is greatly evocative about an era now past. Most of all, ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BONS BONS is about the gift of long-term friendship: its redemptive qualities, its nurturing ones, its absolution.	2005-04-23

They chronicle the comings and goings of the haute monde, offering a virtual laundry list of their collective pretensions and affectations, where to eat, what to wear, and the proper events at which to be seen. It's all here, though libel laws have required the authors to offer thinly disguised versions of some characters which are based on notorious real-life people. As far as this latter group, Karasyov and Kargman really have their number! <br /> <br />The two authors don't seem to have forgotten a single rumor or scurrilous report from that era; in fairness, in terms of this kind of popular fiction, these tawdry recollections do not make for bad reading. <br /> <br />In the end, the authors go for a morality tale. <br /> <br />All in all, THE RIGHT ADDRESS is an easy read and an intriguing one.	2005-04-07

I just don't understand how JoJo ends up as a top literary agent in London, instead of the New York City cop that she started out being. Literary agency is a tough business in any country, and it's a big jump across the pond from Manhattan to England. Some backstory here really was necessary to make this particular plot point convincing. Why literary agency? Why London? What was the basis of her enormous (and rather quick) success? <br /> <br />Nonetheless, in THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY, Keyes spins her usual wonderful tale, good to the very last page.	2005-04-06
US	53014052	ROQX47CZH0C9R	0156941767	670344200	A Walker in the City	Books	2	8	27	N	Y	Overrated	I first read A WALKER IN THE CITY as an adolescent, and the book impressed me, in that mysterious way that things that we know \\"should\\" impress us can do. <br /> <br />I re-read WALKER as an adult and, by modern standards, I think that it is overrated. <br /> <br />It is long and rambling and self-indulgent. <br /> <br />By rights, A WALKER IN THE CITY should have resonated for me, since my own father had grown up in Brownsville, exactly the same neighborhood that author Alfred Kazin describes, and at virtually the same time. <br /> <br />Yet I found little about Brownsville in this dreary memoir; it simply explores the rather maudlin sentiments of the young Kazin. Swifty Lazar, the late literary agent who was renowned for representing men of letters, as opposed to being a man of letters himself, had offered a far more compelling description of life in that same Brownsville in his own memoir. <br /> <br />No, WALKER only is about Kazin and his adolescent imagination, his theories about those who lived in places other than Brownsville (to wit, \\"the city\\") and about his personal (and intensely idiosynchratic, if not peculiar) yearnings. <br /> <br />There are points in which he uses Yiddish without offering a translation, and even a section in which he lapses into high-school French, again with no translation. His use of language often seems strained and self-conscious, such as using the word \\"plash\\" as--I think--a synonym for \\"splash.\\" <br /> <br />Insofar as much of the book had been printed in contemporary magazines as essays, the format here has cobbled together several essays into a memoir. In consequence, this memoir could have used better editing, since things that are fully explained on their first mention do not need the identical explanations further into the book; such styling would be reasonable in a series of magazine pieces, but not in a volume offered as a cohesive work. <br /> <br />I cannot help wondering whether A WALKER IN THE CITY, first publishedin 1946, would be as enthusiastically received if it first saw print today. It strikes me as the literary equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes.	2005-03-30

It's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or A TIME TO KILL set against a football background, just as A FEW GOOD MEN was a morality tale set against a military background. <br /> <br />Again, this is a riveting plot, absolutely compelling. RAILROADED is one of those books that a reader cannot put down until it reaches its conclusion. <br /> <br />I predict that author Whitfield Grant has a glorious career ahead of him.	2005-03-28

Though she's a generation younger than I am, her fictional life of place and career are not altogether different than my real one. <br /> <br />While I didn't expect much from this novel, having bought it for this most personal of reasons, I was pleasantly surprised as the plot unfolded. Senate's story is engaging, and very believable. What single woman has not desperately sought a date for a special black-tie occasion? That is a main subplot of this book, as the heroine prepares to attend her perfect cousin's perfect wedding to the perfect man. The struggle that dating then becomes is the book's unifying motif, to funny effect. <br /> <br />Along the way, Senate explores some life lessons. She leaves her readers with the important theory that it is important to know who one is oneself, rather than creating a phony persona in the hope of connecting with a dream man; that until a woman is comfortable with herself, she cannot be comfortable in a relationship. As Senate sees it, it all comes down to basic self-worth. <br /> <br />The setting of this book almost rises to a character, so good is the sense of place that Senate creates both of Manhattan and of what it is like to have a job on a top magazine peopled by backstabbing co-workers. <br /> <br />SEE JANE DATE is not the usual \\"chick lit.\\" It is far better.	2005-02-28

David Heymann. <br /> <br />Heymann has attempted the unusual: A group biography which interweaves the stories of the different members of one discrete, if informal, group. <br /> <br />Heymann does a good job in exploring the personal histories of the members of this club, a troop which primarily included Katherine Graham, Evangeline Bruce and Pamela Harriman. Of this bunch, only Sally Quinn, the youngest, still is alive. <br /> <br />Heymann offers the standard versions of their lives, but he also dishes some dirt about their affairs, promiscuity and family suicides. <br /> <br />It is amazing how much power these women had yielded over the highest ranking members of the federal government. This power was gently applied during socializing at various festivities which ranged from barbecues to black-tie dinners.  <br /> <br />The heyday of the ladies was during the Kennedy administration and, in consequence, THE GEORGETOWN LADIES' SOCIAL CLUB re-acquaints its readers with the Camelot myth. <br /> <br />Perhaps unavoidably, in the effort to be scholarly and thorough, the prose in this volume is less interesting than the women it is describing. To paraphrase an old joke, these were no ladies. Bluntly, they sound like witches, every one of 'em. Yet probably just because of this personality trait, their stories make for an fascinating read. <br />  <br />	2005-02-11

ISLE OF PALMS is, very simply, a good read. <br /> <br />After completing this novel, one might conclude that the precipitating event seems implausible, that the ending is too tidy and too happy. <br /> <br />And, while in the midst of the book, some of the dialogue seems stilted, more likes speeches than like normal speech. <br /> <br />All of these considerations are quibbles, however. <br /> <br />The sense of place is strong in this book, so strong that the reader can smell the ocean off the barrier island of North Carolina which has its name used as this title. In fact, by the end of the book, one is ready to pack up and move to the ISLE OF PALMS. <br /> <br />In ISLE OF PALMS, Dorothea Benton Frank has authored a compelling and engaging story, a story which will engross the reader from the first page to the last.	2005-02-10

In the appropriately-titled CITY OF DREAMS, author Beverly Swerling describes the earliest settlement of a patch of mud that would become the metropolis of New York. That the grim place she writes about would develop into the capital of the modern world seems almost miraculous.     As the author reports, the Europeans who founded Nieuw Amsterdam had been, themselves, a harsh group who endured a grim little settlement in which the main activity was preparing for attack by the Native Americans.    This is a work of enormous scope... enormous imagination... enormous detail and enormous scholarship.     The story begins with the original Dutch settlement, c. 1660, and continues past the Revolutionary War. In fact, CITY OF DREAMS tells many stories against the spine of a single fictional family who had much to do with the founding of New York's medical system.     CITY OF DREAMS is a riveting, compelling, fascinating novel and Ms. Swerling is to be congratulated on both her vision and her scholarship.     Anyone with an interest in the City of New York and in the earliest colonial history of America, as well as curiosity about the evolution of the medical profession, will find CITY OF DREAMS to be extremely worthwhile reading.	2005-01-08

The man that she describes her father as being was not an impressive person, marvelous though he had been as an entertainer.    This is not to belittle his accomplishments as a singer, Las Vegas performer, recording artist, television star, movie star and comedian. In all cases, he broke new ground and earned record amounts of money.    Still, the human being that his daughter describes was shockingly flawed. The way that he had treated her mother, his first wife, was appalling and inexcusable. Consequently, this mistreatment had a devastating impact on the four children that the couple had had together.    Nonetheless, the book is fascinating, exactly as a reader might expect in learning about the upbringing of the children of Hollywood royalty. The names that the author drops, very legitimately, are the most prestigious in the entertainment industry, beginning with classmates named Arnaz and Bridges and, of course, Sinatra.    Still, Deana Martin pulls no punches. One gets the sense that she has accepted this mistreatment and forgiven it, that she has trained herself to move forward in life.  Nonetheless, it is clear that she never will forget the inappropriate behavior that damaged her existence. In a ladylike way, she lets those who deserve a hit have it, whether the hit is directed toward her step-mother Jeanne or to Liza Minelli.    There are a few sloppy glitches in the copy which are more the editor's fault than the author's, such as referring to Pat Kennedy Lawford as Peter Lawford's sister, rather than his wife.    Ultimately, this is a fascinating book, but very sad. After finishing it, the sole fact that emerges is that Deana Martin is a very special woman.	2005-01-02

He has appointed himself to prove, once and for all, how TWA Flight 800 met its end. <br /> <br />For those of us who spend time on the Eastern End of Long Island, the tragic explosion of that airplane off of our coast, and the deaths of all of the 230 people aboard, came to feel personal. <br /> <br />In the almost a decade since it all happened, many theories have been floated. The most popular, certainly on Long Island, is that 800 was brought down by a missile launched by an obscure Middle Eastern terrorist group. This theory is widely popular, except with official American law enforcement agencies.  <br /> <br />Even though the federal government saw fit to produce an animated recreation of its version of the explosion, a version which has nothing to do with popular perception, this animation has not stopped the theorists. And, after September 11th, 2001, we all finally had a name to attach to those terrorists, too. <br /> <br />In NIGHT FALL, in his usual thorough fashion, DeMille assembles the myths and the theories, giving fictional proof to the popular presumptions. <br /> <br />As in PLUM ISLAND and LION'S GAME, DeMille's protagonist is John Corey, a former NYPD detective retired on disability. Corey takes us through every possible alternative explanation. If Corey has one problem, it's that he sounds too damn conceited. But he definitely is clever, and he makes for good reading. <br /> <br />For a work of fiction, NIGHT FALL is not the easiest of these three related novels to complete, having a weak story arc despite the true event it explores. In fact, in the first third of the book, DeMille basically has to re-tell the sad event, to make sure that he and his readers literally are on the same page. Bluntly, a lesser author never could have pulled NIGHT FALL off as a compelling work of fiction. <br /> <br />Inevitably, Detective Corey (and author DeMille) come to the only possible explanation of this mystery. Yet there is another plot here, too, an unstated plot that moves inexorably to its own conclusion. <br /> <br />At the end of the book, this concluding event is the proof that the reader needs that the attackers were those whom Corey has suspected all along, even if the application of this proof is fictional. <br /> <br />Watch the clues and the secondary parallel plot in NIGHT FALL. In hindsight, DeMille makes the point that it all was inevitable. Of course.	2004-12-22

Insofar as decades have passed since his death, much that had been written about him during his lifetime now has been forgotten and, therefore, some of the information in this biography will strike many readers as new.<br /><br />Accordingly, author Marc Eliot has done a workman-like job of assembling existing facts, and of discovering other facts heretofore unknown. The mass of original material he has sorted through, as stated in the bibliography and notes, is huge and impressive.<br /><br />He goes into detail not before seen about Grant's earliest history, particularly Grant's first years after arriving in the United States from England. The author comes to some conclusions that are not firmly supported in fact, but which do seem reasonable as he presents them.<br /><br />Eliot comes out firmly in support of the long-standing theory that Grant was a homosexual--or, more likely, bisexual. The author also presents evidence that, in his early and hungry days in New York, Grant had worked as a male escort. Eliot also claims that the actress Mae West, in her day, had run an escort service there, and he conjectures that Grant may have worked for her.<br /><br />Some of Eliot's conclusions seems flimsy and unsupported, while others are plausible.<br /><br />On page 72 of the hardcover version, Eliot offers a description of Grant's famous cleft chin that is one of the funniest things ever printed; almost certainly, unintentionally as funny as the passage ends up reading. Yet, on reflection, there is a certain truth and sense to Eliot's thesis.<br /><br />Other issues are a bit sloppy, including some of the prose, which would have benefited by good editing. Particularly puzzling was the anecdote about how much Frank Sinatra and Grant had hated each other on the first movie they did together, in light of the strong friendship Eliot later credits these men with establishing. As an author, Eliot owes it to his readers to connect these two stages of their relationship, from hatred to friendship, and this discrepancy never is acknowledged.<br /><br />What makes CARY GRANT: A BIOGRAPHY especially good reading is the story of the creation of the motion picture industry, which Grant entered at an early stage of that industry's development. In consequence, the story of Cary Grant and his emergence as a movie star inescapably becomes the history of the modern entertainment business. As a result, this biography is peppered with names long forgotten, and these inclusions clearly enrich the book as a whole.<br /><br />CARY GRANT: A BIOGRAPHY is a must-read for all fans of this actor, as well as for anyone with a keen curiosity about Hollywood in its heyday.dits these men with establishing.

In the case of THE TRUE AND OUTSTANDING ADVENTURES OF THE HUNT SISTERS, the reviews were not complimentary enough. <br /> <br />Author Elisabeth Robinson tells a complicated and moving story in the form of letters written by Olivia, her heroine, to the people in Olivia's life. <br /> <br />Olivia is commuting to Ohio, where her younger sister is dying of leukemia, from Los Angeles, where she is in the process of producing (as the expression goes) a \\"major motion picture.\\" <br /> <br />In her letters, Olivia explores the incomprehensible suffering inflicted by the conventional treatments of cancer that her sister courageously endures while she herself attempts to hold her own in the competitive Hollywood studio system. <br /> <br />At many points, Robinson's prose is absolutely lyrical. Her insights are piercing and her powers of observation are breathtaking. <br /> <br />The reader will come away with a much more thorough insight into the suffering of a leukemia patient, as well as a peek at how the entertainment industry actually operates. In their own fashions, these two stories examine activities almost equal in their cruelties. <br /> <br />This is a lyrical, touching novel, and it is not overstating to call it \\"brilliant.\\" <br /> <br />	2004-11-16

By now, Becky is becoming not so much endearing as annoying; her adventures (and misadventures) must strain the belief of her most faithful fans. <br /> <br />Of course, \\"SHOPAHOLIC & SISTER\\" contains much that fans of this series have come to expect, including the detailed, even loving, explanations of the merchandise Becky compulsively acquires.  <br /> <br />Yet even for fiction, the irrational way that this character behaves, and the greed and self-involvement she displays, make it impossible for a reader to accept that the fictional character of the terrific husband has fallen in love with Becky. <br /> <br />Kinsella is a talented writer. She should take a lesson from some of television's better series, such as \\"Seinfeld,\\" \\"Frasier\\" and \\"Friends,\\" and move along professionally before she destroys the reputation she worked so hard to earn. <br /> <br />Other than cashing in on her success, there doesn't seem much reason for Kinsella to have written SHOPAHOLIC & SISTER.	2004-11-14

And I seem to say this same thing every single time I read a book by this author. <br /> <br />LITTLE BITTY LIES is funny, it's clever, it's unexpected and, ultimately, it even is plausible. <br /> <br />Ms. Andrews hooks her readers right from the get-go, and takes them along for a romp that includes a rotten husband who abandons his family...the possible death of that same husband...affairs, adultery, divorces, senility and oh, yes, eyebrow waxing. <br /> <br />She sustains this pace, keeping the fun level up, while actually painting a very black and diabolical picture. <br /> <br />And everything in the plot works out for the best, including a recipe for a fabulous chicken salad that is sure to become a standard at my house.	2004-11-09

He constructs scenes and dialogue that have razor sharp edges to them. <br /> <br />Still, he seems determined to broadcast the resolution of this whodunit early and often in the novel. Even though he patiently and laboriously leads the reader to the final discovery, he makes it too clear how this mystery will be solved. <br /> <br />In mysteries, authors who give no clues can frustrate their readers. Siegel gives too many clues, ruining what should have been an unexpected and clever ending. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, FINAL VERDICT is very, very good reading, certainly more than good enough to warrant reading the other novels by this same author. <br />	2004-10-16

The cycle of life here begins with the Vietnam War and ends with the September 11th attack. <br /> <br />All of this is fine. It only is after the novel has been completed that it becomes obvious that the story is implausible. Author Morsi has given her poor characters more trials than the Biblical Job. <br /> <br />She also fails to explain the feelings of the husband and wife for one another, the wife remaining particularly ambiguous. Does she ever love the husband? Did she love him at some points in their marriage? Is she still in love at the end of the tale? <br /> <br />Beautifully as this book has been written, these are the questions which inform the underlying story, and these questions never are explored. <br /> <br />The parts of the novel about small town life, and about a small town in mid-20th Century America joining the modern world, are among the best of SUBURBAN RENEWAL'S subplots. <br /> <br />SUBURBAN RENEWAL is not perfect fiction, but it is good.	2004-10-12

Really, I am pooped from reading POPPED. Yet since it was the only book that I had with me on a plane trip, I was stuck with it. <br /> <br />The only mystery with POPPED is how a reputable publisher would dare to sell this nonsense to a trusting public, and that mystery is solved by a single word, \\"nepotism.\\" Obviously, if author Carol Higgins Clark were not the daughter of best-selling author Mary Higgins Clark, she would be waiting tables, not writing novels. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, since the publishers must be making some money marketing mysteries under the \\"Higgins Clark\\" name, could they not justify assigning an editor to Carol's manuscripts? POPPED contains some of the worst grammar and syntax that ever has appeared in print. <br /> <br />Conceptually, POPPED must have had potential. The setting of the balloon festival in New Mexico--a setting which, of course, is not fully explored--should have been appealing. Everything in POPPED either is sketchy and unrealized or much too easily resolved. <br /> <br />The characters are so forgettable that, even while in the midst of reading this stupid story, I had to refer back to remember who was who. And the outcome was a surprise because there was not a single clue to lead a patient reader to the result. Oh, puh-lease. <br /> <br />Even Amazon's \\"Number One\\" reviewer ought to be ashamed of herself for giving POPPED a five-star review. There's a word for what Number One has become as a result of awarding this rating, and that word isn't nice. <br /> <br />It is sad to think of all of the decent authors struggling to sell their own novels when this piece of garbage, attached to the surname of a successful author--but not written by that successful author--is foisted on to an unsuspecting public.	2004-10-11

In the process of telling her story, Donoghue shares some insights into the class structure of England, and an overview of the admittedly limited rights of independent women. Too, I was fascinated to learn that there was a formal lesbian underground in England during the late 18th century. <br /> <br />LIFE MASK is an interesting novel.	2004-09-27

It seems as if, as an author, Robards is cashing in on a well-earned reputation. <br /> <br />The plot of BEACHCOMBER is simplistic...the story itself is short...and the outcome is, bluntly, creepy. In fact, the outcome actually is lazy, relying on a creepy twist to bring the story to a quick end.  <br /> <br />The characters never get developed, so the reader has no reason to care about the resolution.  <br /> <br />Consistent with everything else about this novel, the sense of place--something which Robards has conveyed beautifully in other novels--is so sketchy that it could have been phoned in to the editor. <br /> <br />For a skilled author, this is a shabby work.

Author Susann Cokal has done impressive research on the early medieval era in France, a moment in time when the Church--the original Catholic Church--promised heaven as the sole reward for life's difficulties. This was a time, remember, when the only difference between rich and poor was that the rich usually had enough to eat. There were no medicines, and it was normal to share one's quarters with one's animals.     Even mirrors were virtually unknown, more of a myth than a reality--and anything not understood and not able to be explained was attributed to witchcraft.    Mirabilis, also known as \\"Bonne Anne,\\" is a girl born of a young woman who may have been a virgin mother. Yet was there really a second virgin birth? And, if there was not a second Immaculate Conception why, then, was the entire town convinced that they had witnessed the impregnation of this particular virgin?    Because, here, the insemination of the mother of this Bonne Anne may have taken place during a church service. She may have been carried high above the heads of the congregants while she was being impregnated. Or--maybe not.     The connotation of the phrase \\"Bonne\\" probably is tantamount to the English word \\"Goody,\\" which was a medieval honorific meaning \\"Goodwife.\\" This was a term of respect, but less respectful than \\"mistress\\" or \\"lady\\" would have been.    The \\"Bonne Anne\\" herself may be a witch. Or--maybe not.     The grandmother of Bonne Anne, who survives her daughter, also may be a witch. Or--maybe not.    The patroness of Bonne Anne may be a witch. Or--maybe not.    Maybe not. Maybe, they just are lesbian lovers. Yet by the standards of that day, were lesbians all considered to be witches? Did they consider themselves to be witches?    And what about the dwarf who grows, and the self-flagellating priest? And does the statue really look that life-like?    Cokal gives us many mysteries. Still, she offers no hard answers except for the fascinating way in which Mirabilis rescues her town from the famine that results following a siege brought by the English.    This is a weird and wonderful book, and even the afterword is mysterious. Is the scholarly note about the heroine on the level, and did she actually exist, or is this note fiction as well?    Read MIRABILIS and decide for yourself.	2004-09-05

Anyone old enough to remember the terrible days after the assassination of President Kennedy understands that line from the play \\"Camelot\\" that has come to be associated with his Presidency. It begins, \\"Once there was a moment that was known as Camelot...,\\" alluding to a magical kingdom.    One would have thought that, by now, there would have been nothing left to be said about the Kennedy presidency and the Kennedy marriage. And, perhaps, for another author, this might have been true. Yet for an author with the impressive reputation of Sally Bedell Smith, witnesses have offered information that never before has been revealed publicly.    This may be that most of the principals now are dead, long dead, and that those who survive realize that there is nobody left to harm by divulging some private memories. Equally, it may be that these survivors realize that this may be their last chances to preserve their memories for posterity.    Admittedly, some of the information about the Kennedy White House, and the deliberate way in which Jacqueline Kennedy modeled the social aspects of the administration on the French court, was shocking. After all, that court had met its quite deadly demise centuries earlier, so to ape its manners in the democratic United States appears unseemly. Accordingly, this attitude never was made known to the American public.    Similarly, it also was a shock to read that the Kennedys were consciously elitist and condescending in their perceptions of middle class America.    GRACE AND POWER also provides some new and touching details about the period immediately following the assassination of President Kennedy, and about how Mrs. Kennedy dealt with her loss.    In all, GRACE AND POWER is a worthwhile contribution to the miles of Kennedy-themed books filling the shelves of libraries everywhere.	2004-08-23

It has to be even more difficult to take over characters created by another author. Keeping these two points in mind, author Vincent Lardo does a good job in McNALLY'S DARE, continuing a series begun by the late Lawrence Sanders. <br /> <br />In DARE, the story is fresh and, oddly, believable, once the reader accepts that Palm Beach, the place where all of these McNALLY mysteries are set, is a peculiar town. PB forever marches to the beat of its very own drummer--a drummer who uses solid gold drumsticks. <br /> <br />And since, for a time, I had lived in Palm Beach, I can say that Lardo definitely gets its rhythms. The sense of place is perfect and Archy, the protagonist, never fails to be amusing. <br /> <br />In fact, Archy's being, well, arch may be these books' greatest problem. There are times when the dialogue gets too damn cute.

Oddly, both Sargent and Gautreau were American ex-patriates, and Davis does an excellent job of describing the American colony in Paris at that particular time. <br /> <br />At the moment of its completion, in the portrait of Virginie, her gown had a strap depicted as falling off her shoulder. So decadent was this considered, so blatantly alluding to things sensual, that the portrait caused a scandal. <br /> <br />Sargent then was considered a rising star and both he and Virginie expected this portrait to solidify their places among the stars of the Belle Epoque. Yet luster would not be added to either of their reputations, not even after Sargent had re-painted the strap into its proper place. <br /> <br />Sargent fled to England, where his prestige slowly recovered. Gautreau, however, remained a virtual outcast of society as a consequence of the negative reaction.  Over the decades, Sargent has remained famous, while Virginie's actual name has fallen into obscurity.   <br /> <br />And if Davis had not decided to step in and tell the whole tale, Virgine probably would have remained obscure. STRAPLESS shows marvelous research about a fascinating moment in time. <br /> <br />	2004-08-19

HISSY FIT is the first book by Mary Kay Andrews that I have read and, having read it, I look forward to familiarizing myself with her work. <br /> <br />This book is a hoot, a real page turner. Even though it's about romance, failed and desired, it is far more than a romance novel. <br /> <br />There's a lot going on in HISSY FIT, more than first may seem apparent. Right away, there's the mystery of what happened to the heroine's mother, who had disappeared years earlier. There are the obviously related issues of the heroine's feeling of abandonment and her need for closure. <br /> <br />Still, as serious as this backstory may be, from the first page to the last, HISSY FIT is a fun read, complete with two hunky heartthrobs who are potential suitors for our heroine. <br /> <br />Author Andrews creates a marvelous sense of place in the small Southern town in which she sets her plot. And the information that she provides about working as a professional interior designer is fascinating, a virtual primer for anyone thinking of this industry as a career. <br /> <br />Only two quibbles, and these are small: Professional designers never use the word \\"drape\\" as a synonym for curtain, as Andrews does repeatedly. \\"Drape\\" is a verb which means \\"to cover\\" while, <br />in contrast, \\"drapery\\" is the noun meaning \\"window covering.\\" <br /> <br />And the character of the tough female attorney reads more ditzy than smart. Any attorney earning a \\"mid-six figure salary,\\" as Andrews has this character claim, may be mercenary and she may be calculating, but she never would be ditzy. <br /> <br />Other than these two minor flaws, HISSY FIT is perfect light entertainment.  <br />	2004-08-18

First, STRAPLESS, a joint biography of artist John Singer Sargent and his most famous subject, Virginie Gautreau, is published. Virtually on the heels of STRAPLESS comes I AM MADAME X, a fictionalized biography of the same Virginie Gautreau. <br /> <br />To be sure, I AM MADAME X is the easier of these two books to read, and it tells a marvelous tale. Still, since it openly is fiction, it is difficult to discern where historic fact ends and author Gioia Diliberto's fertile imagination has taken over the purportedly first-person report. Though Diliberto's scholarship seems excellent, there is no doubt that she has fabricated backstories to explain some of the recognized events in Virginie's life. <br /> <br />There is her detailed explanation of Virginie's strange marriage, and a subplot about an American black woman who has moved to Paris and is trying to pass as white. How true any of these anecdotes may be are impossible for the reader to know. <br /> <br />Too, the author's conclusion as to the pleasure that Virginie and her family derived from Sargent's famous painting is in direct contradiction to the details offered in the non-fictional biography. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I AM MADAME X provides one of the best \\"contemporaneous\\" accounts of the Paris Commune of 1870, and of the emergence of the Belle Epoque period. <br /> <br />Taken together, STRAPLESS and I AM MADAME X offer wonderful insight into the late 19th Century Parisian social set.	2004-08-17

For the scholastic detail he brings to the tale, he earns another star. That extra fifth star is withheld because, despite the fascinating story, the tale is not as gripping as many other suspense novels. <br />  <br /> Still, this is not to besmirch Brown's scholarship, which deserves to be described by that overused word, &quot;awesome.&quot; And, as already stated, both his imagination and his story-telling skills are first-rate, no small feat in a novel this complicated. <br />  <br /> Oh, what the heck!

Nonetheless, they undoubtedly would be construed as public figures under the libel laws of the United States. Evans, therefore, obviously is comfortable with some of the allegations that he makes here. <br />  <br /> Nobody who reads this book ever will feel the same about any of the primary cast of characters. President Kennedy reads almost like a sexual pervert and, according to Evans, his wife may have defined the concept of the &quot;Merry Widow.&quot; Her sister, Lee Radziwell, comes over as even more ungrounded than Jackie was in conventional morality regarding adultery--and this is being polite. <br />  <br /> According to Evans, Marilyn Monroe sounds anything but simple, and Robert Kennedy appears almost venal. Evans casts doubt on everything including the motivation behind Jackie's pregnancies and those of Ethel Kennedy, considering them to be largely political tools contrived by the husbands. This seems hard to believe. <br />  <br /> The person who comes across worst is Aristotle Onassis. Among the other assertions in this book, it is claimed that Onassis originally had been a homosexual and that the basis of his fortune had come from drug smuggling. <br />  <br /> The kicker is that Evans states that Onassis had arranged for the assassination of Robert Kennedy, his &quot;nememis&quot; of the title, by Arabic terrorists. <br />  <br /> NEMESIS makes for gripping reading, one of those books that prove impossible to put down until the very last page.	2004-08-01

Hence, the version of ENEMIES that I read was a translation. <br /> <br />Still, the simplicity of his prose shines through the novel. His storytelling skills are spellbinding. <br /> <br />Mr. Singer perfectly captures the undertone of desperation and doom connected with those who endured the Nazis and survived. <br /> <br />This novel will shock and it will sadden but it never will be less than writing at its finest.	2004-08-01

I thought that it was a cheat, on many levels.<br />First of all, it was short. It only took me about an hour to read.<br />For the most part, it was a book about the stylized and self-conscious Victorian ritual of mourning among the upper class English; and the better part of the book was nothing more than a detailed report on cemetery and crypt design, on mourning clothes and mourning jewelry and mourning stationery and mourning time schedules.  <br />Author Tracy Chevalier uses the term &quot;mute&quot; in the context of mourners with no further explanation. Were mutes, then, paid mourners who filled out a funeral, and kept silent during the service?<br />Her greatest insult, however, was to the women's suffrage movement. According to her telling, the suffragettes were little more than a group of bored women, slightly hysterical, who viewed their political goals as a silly game. I have read many books on the women's suffrage movement and I never have come across this interpretation anywhere else. She has slandered a movement that moved the cause of women into the 20th century.<br />I didn't care for Chevalier's earlier fiction, GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE--I didn't even like the movie it was made into, which bombed at the box office. I far preferred the competing novel, GIRL WITH PEARL EARRING, which was published at that same time as BLUE.<br />I will not be reading Chevalier's future work.	2004-06-30

Author Daniel Silva has done his usual wonderful job with the book THE UNLIKELY SPY.<br />THE UNLIKELY SPY is an old-fashioned thriller, in the vein of the great spy novels of earlier decades.<br />Set principally in England during World War II--with detours to New York and Nazi Germany--it is a gripping story which keeps the reader turning the pages to see what will happen next.<br />The plot is brilliant in it conception, in its breadth, and in the execution. <br />Silva does a good job conveying what life must have been like in London during those hard years of World War II.<br />His premise is that the Allies had to mislead the Nazis, carefully and deliberately, to misdirect them from expecting the invasion of Normandy, this being \\"misinformation\\" in the purest sense of the word. <br />This novel focuses on the British Secret Service (precursor of the service in which the fictional James Bond is said to have been a member) and on exactly how they could structure this deception. There is a great deal of plausible detail, and some cliffhanging moments in Silva's telling. His research is awe-inspiring.<br />Long as the book runs, there are a few subplots and earlier clues that remain unaddressed at its conclusion--or, alternatively, these are tied up too simplistically, too off-handedly, too incompletely, to do anything but cheat the engaged reader.<br />Still, these few blips are insignificant in a work of this magnitude. Daniel Silva has proven that his talents are as good as anybody writing today.	2004-06-26

The title, of course, is funny; for the most part, so is the novel.<br />In fact, this book is just a romp to read. The pages fly. It is only after it is finished that it becomes obvious that, even for fiction, the plot is improbable. Would four total strangers, four strangers leading completely unconnected lives, after meeting at a mutual friend's retirement party actually have bonded the way that these women are supposed to have done?<br />Would a tenured professor at MIT take a leave of absence to pretend to be the secretary of one of the group, in order to engage in interoffice spying for her new friend?<br />Would a wealthy widow take a housekeeping job in the home of the fiancee of the professor's son in the hopes of discovering dirt about the fiancee's family?<br />Would that same professor, younger than the others, be so ignorant that these new friends would need to explain the symptoms of menopause to her?<br />And would all the subplots have happy endings, with all characters vindicated and validated? Life doesn't work like that.<br />There also are a few editing glitches in this work.  These probably are more the publisher's responsibilty than the author's but, despite some cumbersome sentences, this novel does move quickly and with great entertainment value. <br />Along the way, author Nancy Thayer also offers some pithy and touching truths about the aging process, and the inevitable exchange of youthful good looks for wisdom. It actually is unfortunate that such pearls of wisdom get buried in this strained plot.<br />All in all, it's fun spending a few hours with the women of the HOT FLASH CLUB.	2004-06-21

Usually, fiction written by co-authors tends to be less cohesive and less informed than the work of a single writer. THE SECOND ASSISTANT is an exception to this rule.<br />Authors Clare Naylor and Mimi Hare do a marvelous job of conveying the energy of the high end of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. Their bios show that these two women do, indeed, have their own personal history with this town, a town which has a unique energy all its own. Setting their novel in a cut-throat Hollywood talent agency, the authors' experiences show in the story that they have crafted.<br />THE SECOND ASSISTANT is a romp, with adventures and misadventures speeding through its pages. The story just flies. And, by its conclusion, we readers will have learned a whole lot more about &quot;the biz&quot; than most of us had known when we started this book--a book that confirms that, yes, it's a jungle out there.<br />There are flaws to this novel, and these are flaws of omission. How come, if the heroine is so terrific and/or gorgeous, she has no clue about how others see her? Why, if her boss is such a creep, do good women adore him? What happened to the psychic therapist? And what internecine warfare went on between the top partners of the firm?<br />Still, reading THE SECOND ASSISTANT is lots of fun, and I hope that there will be a sequel to answer these questions.	2004-06-18

Yet in SUSHI, in common with her other novels, she examines issues that neither are shallow nor trivial.<br />While the theme of Dublin singles is a bit boring and a bit tiring--looking for love being universal--the rest of the book is marvelous.  The author examines infidelity and betrayal, the crippling aspects of clinical depression and the problems of the homeless.

As a reader, I had loved author Cynthia Hartwick's first book in this series, LADIES WITH OPTIONS. So it was with great expectations that I started reading LADIES WITH PROSPECTS.<br />Yet, at the beginning, I didn't care for this work as much as I had the earlier book; bluntly, this story and these characters are not as endearing. <br />Still, as I continued on, I realized that this plot is much richer and more complicated. While OPTIONS had aspects of a fairytale about money, LADIES WITH PROSPECTS tells a plausible tale.<br />Well into the novel, I realized what a wealth of information this author possesses. She obviously has an expert's knowledge both of business and of the highest levels of technology, to which she adds a working knowledge of the film industry. <br />With wonderful imagination, she has woven these elements--and, oh yes, a little romance, too--into LADIES WITH PROSPECTS, using language in an easy and elegant manner.<br />LADIES WITH PROSPECTS is as complicated as any Dickens saga--a master to whom she pays homage--but a whole lot more plausible. And, in the process of divulging the plot, Hartwick examines the impact of the corporate raiders of ten years ago on a small town in which the sole factory (and largest employer) has been purchased and systematically stripped of its assets.<br />By its end, LADIES WITH PROSPECTS is as full and compelling a saga as Dickens himself would have written, if he only had been a modern woman.<br />Cynthia Hartwick is an author to watch.	2004-05-02

The purported thoughts that author Susan Donovan puts into this tiny animal's head are hilarious.<br />The rest of the book is kind of strange, but it makes for easy reading. There are too many coincidences--no, it wouldn't be fair to give them away in a review--and the whole romance is too quick and too facile, even for a fairytale.<br />Still, Ms. Donovan writes well. The background detail that she provides on her hero and heroine is nicely done.  The heroine is an animal behaviorist and the hero is an...well, mentioning his career would reveal too much, too soon, and doing this might spoil the story for other readers. It is obvious, however, that Ms. Donovan has done her homework on the two rather unique careers into which she's placed her main characters.<br />From the plot, it is equally obvious that Susan Donovan has a fertile imagination. Again, the Hairy subplot is fresh, funny and, yes, weird.<br />The sex scenes sizzle as well, putting this author in the same category as many better-known romance writers.<br />Ms. Donovan is an author to be watched.	2004-04-23

There are a few themes that run through one or more of her books; for example, LOLA CARLYLE REVEALS ALL had tones of SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE. Still, these two stories each were unique. In contrast, DAISY is a mish-mash of devices that have worked for this author in the past, thrown together here in the apparent hope that these will coalesce into a good plot.<br />Want to read about two kids who had had crushes on each other once-upon-a-time and finally are reunited as adults? Her book TRULY MADLY YOURS beats DAISY any day. And for a story about a girl who \\"forgot\\" to tell the father of their baby that they had become parents, Ms. Gibson's SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE is the best.<br />As for the woman returning after decades to her hometown, Susan Elizabeth Phillips tops anything that Rachel Gibson has written in Ms. Phillips' new novel, AIN'T SHE SWEET. <br />Yet all of these elements show up in DAISY'S BACK IN TOWN, and with far less success than in their first airings.<br />In DAISY, the conflicts are revealed too easily, resolved too quickly--and even too happily. Despite the obvious fact that this is a genre that requires a happy ending, the conclusion of DAISY just is too pat. Although the genre actually requires sexual conflict that concludes in great passion, Ms. Gibson could have phoned in these love scenes. It almost seems as if her editor begrudged her the space to explore the story fully.<br />Rachel Gibson has done her previously-excellent reputation no service with DAISY'S BACK IN TOWN. Do yourself a favor and read one of her earlier novels instead.	2004-04-13

Some of them, I've liked a great deal and some of them...well, I didn't like a few of the others at all. Now, I safely can say that I enjoyed LUCKY STARS the best of her books.<br />What makes LUCKY STARS so good? For one thing, Heller's writing, but her prose always is lively and reliable. So there must be an additional element and, here, it's the story. The tale of aspiring actress Stacy Reiser rings true, and the turns that Stacy's life takes seems plausible, if unlikely. Yet that's the point of fiction, to take the unreal and make it real, and Heller makes this transformation beautifully here.<br />By a quirk of fate, I've followed Heller's path in a literal sense, living in a New York area suburb when she did, relocating part-time to the same area of South Florida at the exact time she moved there and moving, yet again, to Los Angeles at just about the same moment. Thus, it is with authority that I can say that no one captures the rhythms of a community better than Jane Heller does in her books, and LUCKY STARS is no exception.<br />After reading LUCKY STARS, one will have a true sense of what life is like in Los Angeles for those aspiring to their big breaks in the entertainment industry, the &quot;company&quot; for which this large city is little more than a company town.  <br />As always, Heller's story is quick and endearing, her dialogue crackles and there's a laugh on every page. The supporting cast is wonderful, too, particularly Stacy's mother and best friend.<br />LUCKY STARS is a terrific and easy read.	2004-04-08

I must admit, with no planning at all, I read the three books in the SHOPAHOLIC series in the reverse order from which these had been written. This reversal may be my good luck.<br />CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC is cute, but it in no way forecasts how clever the later two books would be. If I only had read this first book, I might not have continued the series, and that would have been my loss.<br />As author Sophie Kinsella became more comfortable with her heroine, the stories became more complicated, more imaginative, and far more hilarious.<br />Still, the character of Becky Bloomwood is fully formed in this first novel, and she must be one of the most endearing heroines in recent history. If excessive shopping actually is an obsessive compulsive disorder, then poor Becky is afflicted.<br />Meanwhile, readers share Becky's world view--and her commensensical nonsense is a sheer delight. Logic that seems skewed at first begins to appear more grounded than conventional thinking. Becky is the contemporary English equivalent of the characters that the late Gracie Allen and Lucille Ball made so beloved on American television.<br />Read CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC. Read the entire series. These are charming books that will make you laugh, and this series will create fond memories that remain long after the novels have been returned to the shelf.	2004-04-07

To answer the question, yes, author Susan Elizabeth Phillips is terrific indeed.<br />I don't read too many romances, but I eagerly await every new book by SEP.<br />Where does she get these plots? Without exception, her stories are riveting.<br />And her dialogue! No one, and I mean no one, writes dialogue like Mrs. Phillips does.<br />That's not to mention her sex scenes. Well, her sex scenes just are the best there are, and that's all I want to say. (I must admit that SWEET seems a bit...cooler...than some of her other novels, but these scenes still are better than any other author's work on the same topic.)<br />Also consistent with this author's style, when she has her heroine inhabit an environment, the reader finishes the book feeling as if she had grown up in that town herself. After reading AIN'T SHE SWEET, one has the sense of what it must be like to have been raised in a small town in the deep South. AIN'T SHE SWEET has aspects of other Southern novels, but the one that seems closest would be SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD. Simply put, AIN'T SHE SWEET is the better story.<br />Anyway, Mrs. Phillips does not let down her large number of existing fans, and she certainly will make new fans here of those reading one of her novels for the first time.

Although the death occurs contemporaneously, the seeds of this murder were planted during World War II, in the Auschwitz concentration camp.<br />As always, Silva has constructed a story that is gripping, compelling his readers to turn every page with bated breath.<br />In the course of solving the murder, the protagonist has to delve deep into the history of the Nazis and the way that they treated their victims. The dead man and the person who ordered his assassination turn out to have crossed paths during the War; it is up to the Israeli agent to determine the answers as to how, where and why.<br />The journey that these questions take him on reveal, layer by layer, many facts still largely unknown about the Nazi extermination machinery.<br />Author Silva has said that this will be the last book in the series. I am sorry that this is his plan as, based on his own extensive research, I suspect that he has other important tales to share.	2004-03-26

It is a pleasure to see the way that she uses language.<br />Second, her heroines never are inexplicable bits of fluff that make a reader wonder why any editor wasted paper on them. All of her main characters are fully-realized and accomplished women.<br />THE MEN OF THORNE ISLAND is no exception to Thomason's style. Sara, the heroine, is an accountant who inherits an island with an old inn on it, an inn that looks charming in the brochure that the estate's lawyer sends her.<br />Of course, the inn is not charming, but Sara works miracles with it so that, yes, it quickly is made charming.<br />Sara also seems to know a great deal about running a vineyard and, conveniently, this island also houses an abandoned winery.<br />In fact, if there is a single flaw in this book, it is that Thomason is not allowed enough space to really explain and expound on Sara's apparently diverse and thorough store of knowledge.<br />Nonetheless, the novel races along, with the reader rooting for Sara and her growing romance.  The character of Nick is one of those perfect fictional men that real women also hope to find. <br />THE MEN OF THORNE ISLAND is an interesting, entertaining and, ultimately, touching story.	2004-03-24

As a young adult, she marries an immigrant who needs a green card just for the fee that his friends are willing to pay her. (This information gives away nothing, since it is offered in the prologue of the novel.) They part after the ceremony, and they don't see one another again for more than a decade.<br />She spends that next decade growing up and becoming an art-and-antiques dealer in Florida. It is only when she meets the man of her dreams that she realizes that...oh, wait a minute...she has &quot;forgotten&quot; to get a divorce from the husband she only had met for a single hour, thirteen years earlier.<br />With the help of a detective and a lawyer, she locates this man in a small Southern town and she personally goes there to deliver divorce papers. Does it go without saying that he is charmed at the very sight of her?<br />Nonetheless, he agrees to sign the papers after his lawyer approves them, and she returns to Florida, secure in her hopes of marrying Mr. Perfect.<br />Author Thomason displays a bone-deep knowledge of the antiques business, and she weaves in a fascinating subplot about art smuggling.<br />This is a charming book, and I can't wait to read the promised sequel.	2004-03-21

It is rare to see an author inhabit a character so fully.<br />The SHOPAHOLIC series to date--CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, SHOPAHOLIC TAKES MANHATTAN and SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT--is far and away the best of the British chick lit novels, easily surpassing a competing heroine named Bridget Jones.<br />Read these books!

To paraphrase Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;the Brits are different than you and me.&quot;<br />First of all, this book broadcast the forthcoming crises from page one. Right at the beginning, it was obvious what was about to happen to the heroine, who was going to instigate these events, who was going to profit.<br />Even though the scene of euthanizing her cat was one of the most touching I've ever read, this fictional woman is plagued by more troubles than visited the Biblical Job. As far as I'm concerned, all of these sorrows pass the point of plausibility and enter into pure nonsense.<br />Author Elizabeth Buchan clearly is an excellent writer, but the story she has chosen to tell here hardly is original. And, for the millions of real women who have lived its variations, there rarely are such validating happy endings as Buchan contrives.<br />REVENGE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN was a disappointment.	2004-03-18

While the book is fiction, it is completely fact-based.<br />Here, he has constructed a fictional tale revolving around a significant contrast. He distinguishes between the phony assistance that the Vatican pretended to the world to be giving, albeit passively, to the Jews of Europe during World War II and the active, but hidden, way in which the Church actually supported the Nazis.<br />He examines the scholarly evidence in this murder mystery set in the present day.  His story is gripping and compelling, so much so that a reader cannot wait to turn the next page.<br />THE CONFESSOR proves that Daniel Silva must be included in any current list of that group of leading authors of thrillers.	2004-03-16

It already had historic overtones then, and it seems even more historic today.<br />CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (a reference to the number of children in the Gilbreth family) accurately represents life in America in the early years of the 20th Century, a simpler time in every way.<br />Reading this autobiography by siblings Frank Gilbreth and his sister, Ernestine Carey, one is reminded of those values that combined together to make the United States the greatest country in the history of the world.<br />The book also transmits a sense of the fun it was to be part of a large family in those long-ago days, and the pride--even the complacency--that came with being citizens of this nation.<br />The original movie made from this book follows the family faithfully; the recent feature film has nothing to do with the real-life Gilbreth family, other than its title.<br />So, read CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN and take a trip to a nicer time now far, far away.	2004-02-21

I remain awed by how seamlessly author Vincent Lardo took over a series started by another writer, in this case, the late Lawrence Sanders. So it is with regret that I don't feel that McNALLY'S ALIBI deserves my customary five-stars, though it certainly earns four.<br />There is a line in a Jacques Brel song that talks about how a character is \\"cute, cute, cute, in a stupid-assed way.\\" Well, sadly, this is the point to which Archy McNally, the protagonist of this series, seems to be evolving.<br />I long have suspected that this Archy was based, at least in part, on Archie Goodwin of the NERO WOLFE mysteries. Yet Archie Goodwin always was suave and elegant, like Cary Grant or James Bond. Never in this series has Archy McNally been suave and elegant; he actually was kind of fey from the very first book. Since that first book was published, a new word has been coined, \\"metrosexual,\\" referring to straight men who enjoy pleasures usually perceived as gay, such as facials and manicures. Not James Bond but more Niles Crane, the brother on the television series FRASIER. Well, though Archy definitely is a metrosexual, the problem is that he is starting to sound more deranged than fey.<br />This is pity, because the plot in McNALLY'S ALIBI is as good as any in the series, and the denouement perhaps even more clever than usual.<br />As someone who has spent a fair amount of time in Palm Beach myself, I also would like to see a bit more local color in these stories.<br />The McNALLY books all remain favorites of mine, but I do hope that the author and his editor can reel Archy back in so that he seems a little more realistic.	2004-02-19

Strained, perhaps, but not about drugs.<br />Author Steve Martini displays a thorough knowledge of laws and legal procedure, in addition to his lively imagination. As a result, he is able to craft a story that is quick-moving and compelling.  Ultimately, however, the plot veers from simply unlikely to completely implausible.<br />The lawyer who is Martini's hero is almost too damned smart, smarter than an entire squad of New York City police detectives. Martini offers little motivation for the desperate need his hero is said to feel to solve the murder of a friend and, without motivation, the entire caper falls apart.<br />The hero also is far too willing to put himself at risk, especially for a character who is supposed to be the sole surviving parent of a teenage daughter. Toward the end of the mystery, the hero has a riff when he internally debates this same need with himself.  This riff doesn't help make the plot more credible; instead, the reader actually can hear the author's editor saying that they must do better to provide rational motivation for the character.<br />The villain is predictable, the story is implausible and so is the hero, and the subplot about the murdered man's widow--hinted at throughout the novel--never is brought to any conclusion.<br />Other than these quibbles, THE ARRAIGNMENT is a swell read.	2004-02-10

A TIME TO KILL, his first novel, is not just good--it is great. As such, it stands alone among his work both for theme and for style.<br />The story is a compelling one, about a black man in a small Southern town, a town bigoted by definition, who openly kills the two white men who have raped his daughter.<br />The plot is exciting. Grisham grapples with moral issues as to right and wrong. The consequences of acting as both judge and jury in exacting justifiable revenge, but a revenge that nonetheless is in direct contradiction to civil law, is examined from many perspectives.<br />This book shows that Grisham is a fine lawyer, and that he also is a lyrical writer.	2004-02-07

Author Peter Biskind cannot have omitted a single detail in the complex history of this industry.<br />As such, the book's greatest virtue also is its largest flaw. As is common in this type of scholarly work, the very thoroughness of his research does, in spots, make for boring reading. There cannot be a detail which escapes his notice, or a participant whom he failed to interview.<br />Some of his anecdotes about Harvey Weinstein, the head of Miramax Films, alone would make DOWN AND DIRTY worth the hours of reading time.<br />For anyone with a curiosity about the independent film business, DOWN AND DIRTY PICTURES is the definitive book.	2004-02-06

She has unearthed a point on the American timeline, dating back to the Depression era, which virtually had been forgotten.<br />Yet Hillenbrand's account is so vivid that the reader gets caught up in the excitement of that moment long past. Her research is breath-taking, and her prose is lively and elegant. She tells this story well enough that the book reads like fiction. <br />And, for the span of this account, one truly can understand the frenzy surrounding this racehorse which was so improbable in its success; in fact, the broken-down horse becomes almost a metaphor for the broken-down spirit of the nation in those difficult days. At his height of glory, Seabiscuit was as important to American pop culture as J-Lo and Britney are today.<br />The vision of the book extends to the film. It is rare for movies to equal, or exceed, the books from which they are adapted, but SEABISCUIT is one of the most visually beautiful movies ever made, much to the producer's credit.<br />Take a break from the bad news of the moment and enjoy the history of the horse that had delighted America during those grim days of the Depression.	2004-01-31

It was so powerful that, at that moment, it frightened me.<br />Re-reading the novel as an adult, I realize that author Joseph Heller was a bona fide genius. In hindsight, it is difficult to believe that CATCH-22 won none of the predictable prizes at the time of its original publication.<br />The absurdity of war, and the struggle of the average soldier to survive his tour of duty, never has been more successfully communicated in literature than Heller did here. <br />Forty years after its first publication, the expression &quot;Catch-22&quot; and the concept behind it have become accepted usages in everyday vocabulary, referring to the cycle of irrationality of problem defying the solution, solution causing the problem.<br />The information on the Amazon website that author Heller lives in East Hampton, New York is out-of-date.  Sadly, Heller died in East Hampton a few years ago; as a resident of the town myself, I am certain of this fact.<br />Time has proven that CATCH-22 is classic literature.	2004-01-31

The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.<br />Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature. And, in creating them, Jane Austen laid the groundwork for the elements that would need to be present in the modern romance novel.<br />All of Miss Austen's books are worth reading, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is unique among them in being great.	2004-01-17

Being a bit too old for &quot;chicklit,&quot; I wasn't expecting much. KNOT turned out to be a delightful surprise.<br />Author Sophie Kinsella has created a marvelous creature in heroine (and bride-to-be) Becky Beechwood. The voice of her character rings completely true; and Becky is a genuine New York type, even if she's English.<br />As a New York bride myself, once-upon-a-time, I enjoyed Kinsella's descriptions. In my day, we thought that we were completely over the top but I have noticed, among the daughters of friends, that the current generation of brides makes their mothers look like amateurs. Kinsella got all of this energy, the obsessiveness, and manic attempts at perfection, rampant in modern wedding planning.<br />At the same time, she tells an interesting story which includes a conflict that does not inform the reader of its resolution early on, a problem in too many other women's novels. The ancillary characters are compelling as well, in a medium that rarely includes any characters other than the hero and heroine.<br />I don't like reading sequels before original work but, in this situation, I am going to go backwards and read the first two SHOPAHOLIC novels. SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT was a thoroughly enjoyable read, and the plane was landing before I knew it.	2004-01-09

It may not be quite as hilarious as &quot;Roadkill,&quot; but it remains howlingly funny.

According to the jacket blurb, author Tim Dorsey was a reporter in Tampa for many years, which explains his authority over the subject matter.<br />The story is kind of a caper, with the bad guy being almost--okay, more--interesting than the hero. There is a vast cast of characters, in the mode of both Charles Dickens and Tom Wolfe, all heading off in various directions until, as is inevitable, their paths collide.<br />Since the story is set in Florida, from Tampa to tony Palm Beach and down to South Beach, ending up in the Keys, there is plenty of money involved, and sex, and kinky sex, and drugs...and murder. <br />The local color is terrific; as someone who has logged a respectable share of hours myself in most of these locations, I can say that Dorsey is spot on.<br />Dorsey's style may be an attempt to pay homage to Hemingway.

Still, it is a feat that an upper educated Englishman can so clearly inhabit the persona of a poorly educated black woman in Botswana.<br />Readers who are unfamiliar with that country will come away with a much more thorough understanding of place after reading THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY.  Smith's heroine is a middle-aged black woman who cleverly solves the mysteries that visit her town. She uses common sense and shrewd observation to put two and two together and come up with four when others are not even counting. As such, the individual vignettes are deeply satisfying.<br />There is a poignancy to Smith's descriptions, however, of how difficult life is in that corner of Africa, of how its people are so accustomed to their hard lives, and how they take pleasure in such small things.<br />Other issues, more terrible issues, are alluded to in the book. Yet some of these secrets are not completely explored, secrets about slavery and voodoo and human sacrifice. Certainly, discourse on these problems would have ruined the pacing of the separate stories, but it was troubling to see them hinted at nonetheless.<br />Alexander McCall Smith is an author of immense talent.	2003-12-17

Specifically, this book features the entertainment industry, basically treating this industry and the city in which it is centered as one and the same. The information offered by author David Wallace mostly dates back to the creation of the modern city of Los Angeles at the turn of the Twentieth Century.<br />HOLLYWOODLAND is an interesting and thought-provoking book which drops many of the industry's largest names, from studio heads such as Harry Cohn and Sam Goldwyn to directors such as Frank Capra and Victor Fleming. The stars are included, too, the greats of the first half of the Twentieth Century, such as Cary Grant, Clark Gable and Rudolf Valentino.<br />Neither are the scandals neglected. Jean Harlow's death is covered, and so is Jayne Mansfield's.<br />There are two significant problems with this book. One is that many of these famous stories, these allegations of the lesbianism of about a dozen of the greatest movie stars in history, are unsubstantiated.<br />The second problem is sloppy editing. This book is rife with typos; it reads as if it is an unedited first draft, or a draft transcribed directly from dictation without being proof-read. In one spot, the word that should have been &quot;and&quot; becomes &quot;an.&quot; Throughout the volume, articles and prepositions are missing. The book was brought out by a reputable publisher, and it reflects poorly on that publishing house to release such an unprofessional work.<br />There's also a strange chapter with &quot;a day in the life&quot; of a fictious aspiring actress, c. 1925. The chapter serves little purpose other than to make a reader wonder whether this book even had an editor.<br />Still, for anyone with a curiosity about the early years of the film industry, HOLLYWOODLAND is a worthwhile book.	2003-12-17

As such, it was a curious book for a spinster in the English countryside to have written in the earliest years of the 19th century.<br />Yet its author, Jane Austen, must have been an astute observer, because no book reveals the manners of its characters, and the rhythms of their lifestyle, more effectively.<br />She penned a perfect story of romantic attraction and sexual tension and resolution; why that story seems so perfect cannot be quantified, but it unquestionably is the reason that \\"P & P\\" has remained a classic for two centuries.<br />In comparison, MR. DARCY'S DAUGHTERS, a modern day \\"sequel\\" to \\"P & P\\" written almost 200 years later, just seems silly.  A voice such as Miss Austen's, a voice that then was fresh and insightful, merely seems predictable and stilted and derivative when parodied here by the author of DAUGHTERS.<br />Jane Austen no longer is around to defend herself and, really, she deserves better.	2003-12-04

ASTOR'S NEW YORK deservedly will become the definitive work regarding the City of New York and, specifically, its upper class, during that period of the 19th Century known as the &quot;Gilded Age.&quot; <br />As such, this book is as much about the evolution of the modern city as it is about the robber barons who shaped the era. The research is impeccable and almost ponderously thorough. <br />The title, however, is somewhat misleading, as the volume is does not focus on Mrs. Astor individually but, rather, on what she meant to her contemporaries in terms of being a symbol and an inspiration as to how one should live.<br />Eric Homberger is an excellent writer.

Certainly, the food descriptions may be the best ever written for a non-cookbook, and the story is clever.<br />Still, as it reaches its too-short ending, TART seems much like a pastiche, with a resolution far too reminiscent of Roald Dahl's famous murder mystery, interconnected relationships that are both implausible and derivative of Dickens in their frequency, and a final act of generosity between the spouses that smacks of O. Henry's &quot;Gift of the Magi.&quot;<br />Various fascinating subplots remain unexplored and unresolved, barely more than hints, particularly regarding the television show and the arrest, and how the latter impacts the former.

The undercurrents at the beginning are reminiscent of Anne Rice. And his language can be almost Shakespearean. Woven together to form a unique and seamless chronicle, it becomes obvious that this is an author with a unique vision and a rare voice. His prose, apart from the story itself, demands reading and re-reading; there were many instances where his lyricism left me breathless.<br />There is no doubt that THE CRIMSON PETAL AND THE WHITE will become a modern classic. It is an extraordinary piece of writing; indeed, it is the rare novel that actually can be considered literature.	2003-11-24

Every once in a while, it is important to go back and read a classic, to remember what it takes to make a novel memorable. THE GREAT GATSBY is an example of perfection, both in prose and in plot. As such, it is timeless.<br />In this book, author F. Scott Fitzgerald perfectly captures the energy of that moment when the Gilded Age was ending and the Jazz Age was beginning. Set among the estates of Long Island's elegant North Shore, Fitzgerald illustrates why \\"the rich are different from you and me,\\" a classic line straight out of this novel.<br />Treatises have been written on whether Fitzgerald was the best American author of the 20th Century. Regardless of the conclusion as to whether he was the single best, there is no dispute that he belongs in the pantheon of the writing gods.  To read GATSBY is to lose oneself in Fitzgerald's lyricism.<br />So, re-read THE GREAT GATSBY, and enjoy what it takes to make a book truly great.	2003-11-15

That said, I find her stories very uneven. Some of her books are marvelous and some seem downright silly. FAKING IT is in the latter category.<br />In fairness, FAKING IT is a story well told. As with all of Crusie's novels, the writing is excellent. The allusions to classic films are clever and the background detail about fine art is interesting.<br />I realize that, in romances and movies, the opening to hook the paying customer is required to be extreme. Here, the hero and heroine literally bump into one another while hiding in the closet of a house that they each separately are attempting to rob. This device of &quot;meeting cute&quot; is too silly to make the rest of the plot seem viable.<br />FAKING IT is uneven at best.	2003-11-15

For the most part, those books seemed to be mean-spirited attempts to bash the Princess' memory while at the same time lining their authors' pockets. <br />Virtually all of these authors appeared to hew to the theory that, since the law does not recognize slander as a legal action when the topic at hand is a deceased party, they then could engage in character assassination, so long as the same re-hashed old tales sold yet more books.<br />In contrast, A ROYAL DUTY is the rare book which attempts to defend and explain the way in which the Princess of Wales lived her life. Thus, simply for going against the tide, it is valuable.<br />Perhaps author Paul Burrell is slightly overwrought in his devotion to the late Princess. He's entitled to be. He dedicated his career to her. Reading between the lines, he has not yet gotten over his first glimpse of her corpse, presumably after its autopsy, a sight for which he was emotionally unprepared, and a sight from which her ex-husband and her family must have been shielded.<br />Was Burrell in love with Diana? Probably, a little bit, in a way that defines the concept of perfect and platonic love. As such, he is her protector. He says that he wrote this book to defend Diana, to explain her side of the story to her sons, and to justify his complete lack of guilt in the witch hunt which Scotland Yard and the royal courtiers mounted against him. On all counts, he makes a compelling case and, reading this book, I came to believe him.<br />Burrell is affronted by the way in which Prince Charles treated his young bride and Burrell makes it his business to make certain that the world (and, therefore, the couple's sons) know the truth. He also wants to be sure that there is no question but that Diana had not wanted the divorce from Charles, that she had loved Charles when she married him, and that she loved him until the day she died.<br />Burrell explains the harshness with which Diana consistently was treated by her in-laws' advisors and counselors. He speaks highly of the Queen, his original boss, and also of the Queen's husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. He credits both of them with trying to save the Wales' marriage. He writes that Diana was grateful to each of them for the rest of her short life, remaining in frequent communication with the couple. Burrell is less tolerant, reasonably so, with the indecisive and arrogant Prince of Wales.<br />Burrell may be even more offended by the Earl Spencer, brother of the late Princess, and by other members of the Spencer family, than he is by the Windsors. In fairness, the Spencers treated both Diana and Burrell far more shabbily than the Royals did.<br />He cannot understand how the Earl could have offered the Princess use of a house on the family estate, to her obvious elation, and then withdrawn the offer. He cannot understand how, after the Princess made her wishes clear that her wedding dress be placed in a London museum, it has ended up on the Earl's property, in the Earl's private museum, to which he charges admission.<br />The Spencer family, in concert with Scotland Yard, contrived to charge Burrell with stealing hundreds of the Princess' personal effects, a case that did not hold up in court. Certain truths speak for themselves... and the fact that it was the Queen herself who acknowledged Burrell's right to hold these items in safekeeping was what kept this case from being brought to a jury. She also corroborated some of his evidence, which not only was disputed by the prosecution but also was refuted and leaked to the press, those leaks presumably coming from the prosecution as well.<br />The book is beautifully written, probably with the assistance of reporter Steve Dennis, thanked in the acknowledgments. And Paul Burrell's wife, Maria, must be a saint to havebeen only the second lady is his life for all of those years.<br />Diana was not perfect, but she was a fascinating woman, kind and funny and elegant. Paul Burrell, quite literally, was Diana's loyal servant. By the end of her life, he obviously knew more about the way in which she lived than did her own mother or sisters.<br />A ROYAL DUTY will prove to be the definitive contemporaneous record of Diana's years as the Princess of Wales.	2003-11-15

I've never since bothered to read another book by author Diane Johnson since that time; admittedly, she seems to be doing just fine without me.<br />Generally, when one first reads a novel and then sees the movie into which the story is made, one inevitably says, &quot;Oh, the book was better.&quot;  Not so with LE DIVORCE.<br />Perhaps it is as much a tribute to the screenwriter as to the original author, but the film makes the story far more believable than the printed page did, and the characters also seem better developed. (Or maybe that's just due to the excellent casting and attractive actors who people the characters.) Even the climactic event which resolves the story seems, somehow, more plausible on the screen.<br />By all means, see the film if you're interested in this story. It will be quicker and far more pleasurable than reading the novel.

The writing style of the narrative is excellent, though the dialogue often sounds stilted.  The premise is clever, though the murderer--no, I won't give away the ending--seemed to be implausible, even as far as murderers go. (A good test of the plausibility of murderers in mystery books, I have found, is whether the reader can begin to imagine that particular character as the wrongdoer.  Here, it would be impossible to link the crime to the resolution, and any clues are too few and too unconnected.)<br />Author Jane Isenberg writes with great passion about her protagonist's love of New York City. This part of the novel, for me, was the greatest display of her writing talent, as well as the part of the entire story that resonated the best.<br />On the other hand, she places most of the tale in a community college in New Jersey, and that actually begs the question: How many potential readers truly are interested in such a setting, regardless of how well she communicates it?  Certainly, it doesn't come close to the Archy McNally mysteries in Palm Beach, or Simenon or Agatha Christie.<br />Still, Jane Isenberg shows enough skill as an author that I certainly will read another of her Bel Barret mysteries before coming to a conclusion about whether I want to continue with this series.	2003-09-05

Mrs. Astor celebrated her 100th birthday quite conspicuously a number of years ago, so she was born right at the cusp of the 20th Century. <br />She was raised in an upper class family which took their status, and the life style such status afforded, without a second thought.

Groundbreaking neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing of Boston had three beautiful daughters born at the cusp of the 20th Century, but it was his wife who raised their girls with the single goal of making good marriages. <br />Daughter Betsey grew up to wed James Roosevelt, son of then-President Franklin Roosevelt, until she divorced him for the far-richer John (Jock) Hay Whitney.<br />Minnie married fabulously wealthy Vincent Astor, but not for long. Vincent subsequently married Brooke Astor, the sole survivor of this group of siblings and spouses and ex-spouses; Brooke has devoted her life to using Vincent's money for good works. And Minnie's second husband was...gasp!...not rich.<br />The beautiful Barbara, known as &quot;Babe,&quot; first married socialite Stanley Mortimer, then divorced him and married the much richer founder of CBS Television, Bill Paley.

She was a 20th century courtesan who, apparently, chose her men for the money and gifts that they would lavish upon her.<br />In REFLECTED GLORY, Sally Bedell Smith has done a scholarly and thorough job of researching and reporting the story of this rapacious woman. The only liason that Harriman had had with a man who was not wealthy was with her first husband, but he was the son of Winston Churchill, England's Prime Minister, at the time that they wed. For the rest of her life, Pamela used her Churchill connection as her entry to all things important--and, to Pamela, the only things that apparently seemed to have been important were rich men.<br />She slept with English nobility--her own father was an obscure English nobleman--French aristocrats, Arab oil sheiks, South American polo players, Italian car manufacturers and filthy rich Americans. And she was an equal-opportunity mistress; she didn't care whether they were married or not.<br />Decades after they first began their affair, Pamela got Averill Harriman to marry her. Thoughtfully, he died soon after, leaving her the bulk of his huge estate.<br />She used some of those funds to underwrite America's financially insolvent Democratic Party, and a young politician named Bill Clinton.

She was the daughter of producer Leland Hayward and actress Margaret Sullavan, whose first husband was Henry Fonda. Fonda's children from his next marriage were among the Hayward children's best friends. This was the cast which peopled Brooke Hayward's childhood.<br />After Sullavan's death, Leland married Pamela Churchill, whose first husband was the son of former English Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The Hayward family's problems trascended Pamela, but Brooke's portrayal of her is as a classic wicked stepmother, a thesis since confirmed by subsequent biographies of Pamela.<br />Since the author here came from a famous family, and since many of the events experienced by her family were extraordinary, HAYWIRE makes for fascinating reading.

One can tell just from the photograph chosen for the cover of LIFE OF THE PARTY that author Christopher Ogden has constructed a fun read. Though his research is thorough and scholarly, LIFE OF THE PARTY flies by easily. (The title itself is a pun, alluding both to its literal meaning and to the fact that Harriman's generous donations gave new life to America's Democratic Party.)<br />In crafting the biography of America's late Ambassador to France, Pamela Harriman, Ogden also provides a social history of the international &quot;Jet Set&quot; of the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. Pamela's journey through the decades was complete with English aristocracy, French nobility, Italian racing car drivers, South American polo players, Arab sheiks, Greek shipping magnates and members of America's monied elite. The link among them is that Pamela Harriman slept with members of each of these groups!<br />In her own, less liberated day, born to obscure English nobility c. 1920, there is no question but that then-Pamela Digby would have been considered a--ahem--loose woman (to use a mild phrase) by those who knew her. Not only did she sleep around, apparently with blatant calculation of how her liasons would benefit her financially and socially, but she also conspicuously went after married men. With the exception of her first husband, the single thread connecting the men she chose was that they were not merely rich, they were filthy rich. And her first husband was the son of Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of England at the time of their marriage. Thus, that match was socially advantageous to Pamela, and she would use the connection as her entry into highest levels of the world's interconnected rich.  Nonetheless, despite her apparent rapacity, it is obvious that her men found her... appealing, to say the least.<br />Some of the affairs that Ogden documents were with the fabulously wealthy Frenchman, Elie de Rothschild, with the fabulously wealthy oil sheik, Aly Khan, with the fabulously wealthy Italian auto manufacturer, Gianni Agnelli, with a fabulously wealthy American, Averell Harriman and another fabulously wealthy American, William Paley. Yet she married the merely wealthy theatrical producer, American Leland Hayward, whose daughter openly despises Pamela to this day. (It seems clear that Pamela settled on Leland due to an urgent need to wed quickly as a matter of financial salvation.)<br />Of course, Pamela was a serial bride. Decades after she first began her affair with him, Averell Harriman finally tied the knot with Pamela. He had been middle-aged when they first had met, and she had been a very young woman. By the time she captured him, she was middle-aged and he was old. Conveniently, he died soon after their marriage and, even more conveniently, he left her his huge fortune.<br />She immediately put that fortune to use in inserting herself as a valuable player in the United States Democratic Party and as an early and generous supporter of then-candidate Bill Clinton. After he became President, Clinton rewarded Pamela by making her his Ambassador to France.<br />Truly, if this book were a romance novel, it would be dismissed out-of-hand as being too implausible.

Yet this is not to belittle her actual influence; an entire generation of women modeled themselves on her style. Her dignity, her educational standards, her appreciation of the arts, all proved to be an inspiration to the world.<br />Author Edward Klein has turned writing about the Kennedys into a cottage industry. This particular biography is a nice balance to many other harsher reports, focusing here as he does on the good points of the marriage of this President and his First Lady.	2003-07-26

Author Charles Higham reveals that, despite being a young woman born during the Victorian era and raised in convents, Rose Kennedy had a sprightly, independent mind and an educated outlook on life--even though her father denied her the formal college experience she greatly had wanted.  Still, Rose was not, as many imagine, a subservient wife hovering timidly in the background.<br />Author Higham has done excellent and thorough research, both on the families of Rose and her husband Joseph, and on the evolution of the strong and independent woman that Rose became.  Higham examines several episodes in the history of the family that usually are brushed under the proverbial rug, especially regarding the lobotomy of daughter Rosemary (ordered by Joe without Rose's knowledge) and the way in which Rose dealt with her knowledge of Joe's blatant infidelities.<br />Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy turns out to have been a fascinating woman in her own right, and ROSE is her story.	2003-07-26

The premise of a harried New Yorker dropping out of life in the Big Apple to take up inn-keeping on a tiny Caribbean island is virtually a universal fantasy in Manhattan, where everyone seems to want to do exactly that--if they're not heading up to the Berkshires instead.<br />As hilarious as the adventures here are, they never actually cross that fine line into the implausible, quite a balance when writing fiction.<br />DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL is a change of pace for Mr. Wouk, who usually writes more serious books.  He probably is best known for MARJORIE MORNINGSTAR, but his versatility is evident in works ranging from THE CAINE MUTINY to THIS IS MY GOD, as well as the important Holocaust work, THE WINDS OF WAR and its sequel, WAR AND REMEMBRANCE.  It is this versatility, combined with his elegant prose, that makes him my favorite author.<br />For years now, it's been rumored that Herman Wouk and Jimmy Buffet are working together on a Broadway musical based on DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL.  Personally, I can't wait!	2003-07-16

The novel has become the definitive story about what is was like to come of age in New York City during the financially-deprived decade of the 1930's.<br />MARJORIE MORNINGSTAR is a book to be read, and savored, and read again.

The imagination that author Dan Brown has revealed through his decision to write this story is beyond ordinary comprehension. The plot he has constructed, revolving around millenia old secrets, combined with the quantity of detail he provides and the depth of his research, is &quot;awesome&quot; in the most literal sense of the word--and &quot;awesome&quot; is exactly the appropriate word to describe this novel. The plot is as layered as an onion, the clues he offers are elusive and tantalizing and, ultimately, all but impenetrable.<br />This is one of the best books (if not the best book) I've ever read. Appropriately, there are many who would remind me that it's the second best book, after the Bible. Well, THE DA VINCI CODE is, in many ways, a further exploration of the Bible.<br />A warning: Don't start this book unless you have the time readily available to finish it.

He has done as much as any single person to shape the modern American entertainment industry; actually, he's done more.<br />From the early days of television on YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS, on which his co-writers included (among others) star Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart, brothers Neil and Danny Simon, Woody Allen, through single-handedly creating THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW, the sitcom recognized as the most seminal in television, Carl Reiner has shaped the medium every bit as much as the medium has shaped modern life. <br />He's made other stops, too, too numerous to mention. Movies such as THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, OH, GOD, WHERE'S POPPA, IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD simply are the tip of that iceberg. And with partner Mel Brooks, he created the much-loved \\"2000 Year-Old Man.\\"<br />I had loved his first novel, ENTER LAUGHING, which my parents had deemed suitable for a child to read. As an adult, I enjoyed AN ANECDOTAL LIFE even more. Reiner reveals himself to be a man of humanity and kindness, devoted to his wife, children, family and dear friends. Of course, he's also howlingly funny. He cannot avoid dropping famous names, because he lived his life among them and, in many cases, was the most important force in creating that fame in others. (Just think of Mary Tyler Moore.)<br />AN ANECDOTAL LIFE is an easy read, organized as a series of short vignettes. Nonetheless, with great style, in this format, Reiner manages to tell the story of his life, from his boyhood in the Bronx (New York) as the child of Eastern European immigrants, through his teen-age summers spent as part of the entertainment in New York's famed Catskill Mountains, right up to the work he's doing now.<br />To some degree, obviously, he's alsobeen lucky, simply being in the right places at the right times. Still, he's made the most of his opportunites. Up to now, his has been a life well-lived, and it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy! I look forward to reading about his future successes.	2003-07-06

Goldsmith details all of it, particularly the notorious custody trial in which Gloria's paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, battled Gloria's notorious mother for custody.  The fact that the focus of this well-publicized battle was just a single little girl too often is forgotten.  This book is a thorough look into a fascinating footnote to history, and a glimpse at the lifestyle of America's richest family from the Gilded Age through the early years of the 20th Century.

This is a fascinating book about three fascinating women who had been best friends since childhood.  One woman, Gloria Vanderbilt, has a reputation that speaks for itself.  Oona is the daughter of Eugene O'Neill, and she married Charlie Chaplin, who was decades older than she was.  They had a long and happy marriage, and many children together.  Carol Matthau's first husband was William Saroyan, and she is the mother of the author.  After a disastrous first marriage, she married Walter Matthau before he was either rich or famous.  Collectively, the three young women personified the concept of synergy, of one plus one plus one adding up to much more than simply three.  They all were the debutantes of Cafe Society in New York in that happy moment just after the end of World War II, the favorites of the gossip columns of that era.  Aram Saroyan has written a touching valentine to his mother and her best friends.	2003-06-27

Cornelius Vanderbilt writes a valentine here to his mother, Grace Wilson Vanderbilt.<br />Cornelius's father was all but disowned by his parents for marrying the purportedly notorious Grace, herself from a rich and prominent family.  Nonetheless, he made as much money as any other member of his estranged family, despite being cast out on his own, and he raised his children as the closest thing to royalty that this country ever will know.<br />Accordingly, Cornelius and his siblings were given childhoods filled with yachts and mansions in Newport and on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, along with a lavishly bejeweled mother who entertained magnificently.  The author himself was largely disowned by his father when he chose a career as a newspaper reporter.  Still, his own professional experience probably makes him a more objective diarist than a conventional loving son might be.  The details that he provides are fascinating, and these certainly would be unknown to an unrelated researcher.<br />This is an interesting and worthwhile book for those intrigued by this unique period in American history.	2003-06-27

Weisberger makes no secret of the fact that she was the assistant of VOGUE editor Anna Wintour. <br />Thus, reading this novel about the assistant to the editor of the world's most influential fashion magazine becomes a guessing game in where the line between fact and fiction has been drawn. Weisberger says in interviews that Anna was a delight while Miranda, her fictional counterpart, is the Devil in Prada. <br />Thus, for those of us who have not worked in fashion, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is an intriguing peek into a private world. Insofar as DEVIL is accurate, it is informative and entertaining as well.<br />Yet there's another quibble: Weisberger's heroine spends much of her time bemoaning the fact that the demands of her position leave her no time for the writing of serious prose. It was jarring, therefore, to notice the many glitches in grammar that this novel contains. Shouldn't a former VOGUE editor and her own book editor have been able to join together in putting out a book that was written more correctly? <br />In a word, this book is cute, no more and no less.	2003-06-23

So, pleased as I am with this Amazon service, I was disappointed when this biography finally arrived.<br />The only other work on Baron de Hirsch that I have been able to find, MOSES OF THE NEW WORLD by Samuel Lee, turned out to be far superior.<br />To say the least, TURKENHIRSCH is skimpy with background and detail. Admittedly, the topic itself does not lend to lively writing. While neither book does justice to this many facets of this fascinating man, MOSES OF THE NEW WORLD will be a more useful resource to anyone doing research on the Baron and his philanthropies.	2003-06-23

SIMPLE STEPS is based on a philosophy of dedicating 10 weeks to changing bad habits in small and, yes, simple steps.<br />This is a small book that is amazingly vast in its scope.  It deals with life's mundane necessities, like controlling dirty laundry so that it doesn't take over a participant's life.  Spiritual issues are addressed as well, and so is health advice that is so basic--walking, taking vitamins, drinking water--that one wonders why it is necessary to buy a book to assimilate it.  Yet necessary it is, if only to have a cohesive and tidy plan on which to rely.<br />Anyone who makes an effort to implement some of the SIMPLE STEPS plan will be the better for this effort by the end of the 10 weeks.  Anyone who succeeds in applying the entire formula will be a changed person: Better organized, healthier, far less stressed.  The chores of yesterday are streamlined by this book's suggestions into the good habits of tomorrow.<br />Sometimes, we forget that the meaning of &quot;inspirational&quot; is &quot;to inspire.&quot;  SIMPLE STEPS is inspirational in the purest sense of the word.

And that restaurant is M, and the handsome newscaster, the interior designer, etc., must be....&quot;<br />As ever, Dunne's writing is so facile that the pages just fly.

Mrs. Fatio was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where she displayed literary talent from the earliest age.  By the 1920's, when she herself was only about 20 years old, she already was a best-selling novelist.<br />Mrs. Fatio's affluent family began wintering in Palm Beach back when that resort was new.  At the turn of the 20th Century, the Town of Palm Beach had been created, virtually whole cloth, by railroad and steel magnate Henry Flagler as an escape for the very rich.<br />Subsequently, Eleanor would marry Maurice Fatio, a Swiss citizen who became a naturalized American.  According to letters Eleanor wrote, and which the author includes in this book, theirs was a great love match.  Maurice was one of a handful of architects responsible for that opulent look now associated with contemporary Palm Beach, a style which has been adopted widely in affluent American communities.<br />Unquestionably, Eleanor and Maurice were accomplished and fascinating people.  One of this book's greatest flaws is the sparcity of detail it offers; too often, his account is little more than a timeline of where they were and when.  The author implies that the Fatio's surviving child gave him access to her mother's papers.  At the least, it would have been nice if he would have reprinted the first chapter of one of Eleanor's bestsellers.<br />Nonetheless, this biography is a fascinating peek at the genesis of Palm Beach through the eyes of two of the people who gave form to the modern town.  Thus, it is worthwhile reading, though the ending in inescapably sad.	2003-05-02

There was no fun here.<br />The dialogue was...dreadful.  Real people do not talk the way that these characters do.  The author shows off her knowledge of the obscure and intellectual in the allusions she has her characters toss off in purported conversation.  Often, these allusions are so obscure that the author only can justify explaining them by having the responding character answer by saying, \\"Huh?\\"  Yes, \\"huh\\" comes up again and again in this purportedly snappy dialogue.<br />The plot, even for a fairytale, is implausible.  The ostensible hero is a stock market guru and billionaire whose mother owns a dating service.  The heroine does not realize that she and the dating service owner reside in the same Manhattan apartment building.  <br />The heroine is persuaded by her sister to use this dating service but, since its propietor is on her own honeymoon, the billionaire son is running the business for Mom.  So, thus do our hero and heroine meet.  Huh?  Haven't these people ever heard of staff?  Is it possible that a busy billionaire is taking time away from his own career to manage his mother's dating service?  Of course, the billionaire is taken with this perfect heroine, but he's gun-shy about marriage because of his mother's multiple attempts.<br />But, wait.  The son also is housewatching Mom's penthouse, so it is fictionally inevitable that the handsome billionaire and the beautiful single woman who is his client will bump into one another as neighbors.  (Actually, housewatchers are hardly necessary in the full-service luxury buildings of Manhattan.)  And, when the roof starts to leak, right into the penthouse, he realizes that he...has...no...choice other than to take refuge in the small apartment of the beautiful new client of his mother's dating service.  Huh?  Hasn't the brilliant billionaire ever heard of hotels?  <br />...<br />The only virtue of this novel is that, while the heroine is openly promiscuous, eager to sleep with men on the first date, she insists on using condoms when she does so.

Little has been written about this Baron, and Lee's book is an important resource for those who are interested in Baron de Hirsch's history of philanthropy.<br />The Baron truly was a fascinating man.  The sole flaw of this biography, and the reason it only gets &quot;four stars&quot; rather than five, is the author's circumspection.  In several places, he mentions that the Baron left &quot;natural&quot; sons who were not the issue of his wife.  It only can be assumed that the Baron had illegitimate children.  Certainly, a fact this intriguing deserves to have further details divulged, especially since author Lee states that the Baron's wife herself adopted his biological sons.  The author, in turn, tastefully adopts silence regarding this matter.<br />The book closes with excerpts of some of the Baron's obituaries.  One quote states that the Baron's friendship with Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria had been a topic of much speculation.  No where else in this biography is this Prince so much as mentioned, however.  Was the Baron the banker of the Prince?  Did they go off together debauching?  Certainly, such a tantalizing statement deserves some explication.<br />Still, the author does an excellent job of presenting the Baron's personal biography, along with copious details of his philanthropies, some of which flourish even a century later.  For this, Samuel Lee must be commended.	2003-05-02

Inescapably, this fictionalized biography of a valiant woman succumbing to a fatal illness has a subtext of pathos.  Thus, hardly surprisingly, the story never quite is able to get past its own grim underlying reality.<br />At the same time, though author Harriet Scott Chessman is a wonderful writer, the book is so short that it seems as if she is cheating her readers.  There have been several works of fiction in the recent past offering possible background accounts of famous artists, or their subjects, or of the periods during which their most famous works were created.  The two similar books about Vermeer, GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE and GIRL WITH PEARL EARRING, each are more fully formed than Lydia Cassatt's report is here.  Maybe it is fair to say that this idea of writing a fiction around a well-regarded painting is an idea which has been worked, and worked successfully--and that it is past time for other authors to move along to new forms of inspiration.<br />It is jarring to read thoughts being put into the mind of Lydia Cassatt when the author has no way of knowing what Lydia might have been thinking.  This device completely breaks the natural flow of the story.  Of course, this always is a risk when any author writes a fictionalized account of an episode in a real person's life.<br />The detail of life in Paris, specifically the lives of rich expatriate Americans in that moment of Henry James and Edith Wharton, are vivid and fascinating.  The exploration of the movement of Impressionist art at the very time when it still was being formed by artists then considered iconoclasts is the highlight of the book.<br />Physically, it is not overstating to say that LYDIA CASSATT READING THE MORNING PAPER is a beautiful little gem of a novella, illustrated as it is with small reproductions of the paintings at issue.	2003-04-11

Please understand that this is not a conventional story.  That said, if one can accept time-travel, whimsy and hot (HOT!) sex, then this is a fun read. <br />(Have you heard the one about the medieval Viking warrior whose ship washes up on a Hollywood movie set? Ba dum bum!) By virtue of everything going on in this plot, VVV truly is distinctive.<br />Author Hill writes beautifully, but there is so much doing in THE VERY VIRILE VIKING that it is easy to overlook her skill.  Her historic detail seems knowledgable and plausible, though I was surprised to learn that medieval Norsemen spoke Middle English.  Still, in reading a novel such as this, a reader either accepts the premise and goes along with the fun, or the reader walks (or runs) away from the book.<br />Sandra Hill displays a keen sense of humor, again easy to overlook in this well-paced tale, as the plot flows along so nicely--dare I say, even so plausibly. It is entertaining to read her displaced character's take on our modern life, on such basic necessities as deodorant and sanitary napkins and \\"dome-noes\\" pizza.  And, as I already mentioned, her sex scenes are as good, or better, than any others I have read in the genre of racy romance--so be warned, because VVV definitely is not for the faint of heart!<br />I definitely look forward to reading more of Ms. Hill's work in the future.	2003-04-09

Without a sufficient command of language on her part, A LITTLE HELP FROM ABOVE would be unreadable. Still, Rosenberg's use of language, and the voice that she has created for her heroine, Shelby, are enough to make this novel a facile read, albeit an implausible one.  <br />The angel-from-above narration is a device that either is accepted by a reader--or it feels totally unacceptable, as well as disruptive to the art of telling the tale.  And the premise about the surrogate mother and the artificial insemination--okay, it's not fair to give the story away in a review, but this subplot, too, strains credulity.<br />The part of the novel that I liked best was the author's depiction of the North Shore of Long Island.  She communicates a wonderful sense of place.  Of course, I grew up nearby myself so, for me, the setting resonated.  I cannot help wondering what other readers who do not relate as well to the locale thought about A LITTLE HELP FROM ABOVE.<br />As a first novel, certainly A LITTLE HELP FROM ABOVE is good enough, though it's not really good.  Ms. Rosenberg's second novel, then, will be the test of her skill as an author.	2003-04-09

This is a small book that uses language which is quiet, and phrasing that is careful and deliberate. The novel tells a story which is distinctive, complex and compelling; the plot is unpredictable right up until the last page.  Only after completing THE SIXTEEN PLEASURES does it become obvious how rich and full a novel it actually is. <br />THE SIXTEEN PLEASURES is set in Florence, definitely one of the most beautiful places on our planet. As the tale unfolds, the reader is instructed about the great flooding of the Arno in 1966, about cloistered religious orders, and about the preservation of rare books. <br />The \\"pleasures\\" of the title allude to a medieval ... manual that is the property of a religious order of nuns, a manual which has been damaged in the flood.  The whole novel is reported in the first person by the narrator, a female book restorer from America. She is seduced by everything with which she comes in contact, including the life of a cloistered nun, the Tuscan region itself, and a male art restorer with whom she re-enacts some of the pleasures.  <br />At all times, the language, under the control of author Robert Hellenga, is lyrical.  THE SIXTEEN PLEASURES is as close to perfection as a novel gets.	2003-04-09

Palm Beach is very much America's Riviera, and Kessler offers his readers a bird's eye look into the resort's peculiar rhythms, and into its manners.  In every situation, Palm Beach marches to the beat of its very own drummer, a drummer who is banging out his music with \\"D\\" color, Asscher-cut, flawless diamonds encrusted on platinum drumsticks.  <br />My biggest complaint is a backward compliment: I wish that this book were longer, and that it could have covered more of PB's inhabitants and their fascinating escapades.  Still, no question that author Kessler has done a thorough job of communicating what life is like in this gilded community.  If the book is somewhat superficial, nattering on about Grand Dukes and Duchesses, famous charity balls that raise almost no funds for their charities, rare cars, exclusive jewelers, dressmakers and decorators, well, this also perfectly reflects the superficiality of the town itself.<br />I also found it disruptive to the flow of Kessler's text when he interjected personal comments about himself and his wife, such as the facts that he is Jewish while she is a member of the DAR.  Really, this wasn't a family biography.  Still, Kessler's own endnotes thank his editor for insisting on this literary device, so I guess that the inclusion of personal details was not his decision.<br />For those who are curious about America's own Cannes-off-Interstate 95, THE SEASON is the best book around!	2003-04-09

Taken as a grouping, these three may be the definitive report of the social history of the moment, as impacted by that War.  Obviously, Tom Brokaw's book of individual reminiscences, THE GREATEST GENERATION, must be included with this list as well.<br />In common with all of these others, David Brinkley, too, is an excellent writer who makes history lively and interesting.  As with each of the other books mentioned in this group, WASHINGTON GOES TO WAR can stand alone on its own merits.  Yet each of these books gains synergistically by being read in tandem with the others.<br />This was a fascinating moment in modern history, and David Brinkley tells tales that most readers would have no other way of learning.	2003-01-13
US	53014052	R1RR03GX9QZOL2	1586481592	64931643	My War	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Touching and Fascinating	Young Andy Rooney was not always the acerbic commentator that television viewers know best from SIXTY MINUTES.  After reading this memoir, MY WAR, written by him, it is easy to see that he grew up in the best traditions of 19th and 20th Century America.  As a result of this upbringing, the young Rooney viewed life through a prism of morality and right and wrong.<br />After he was inducted as a soldier in World War II, he was lucky enough to be assigned, for reasons that make little sense, to the famous Armed Forces newspaper, the STARS & STRIPES.  Without a doubt, had he not ended up on the staff of this newspaper, he would not have had his subsequent civilian career as a reporter.<br />A consequence of this Army assignment, in his role of reporter, Rooney was a witness to some of the most significant actions of this war, including the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps.<br />Very aptly titled, this memoir is the story of World War II as observed from Rooney's unexpected bird's eye view.  It is a personal history, written in his own inimitable and riveting style.  The report he gives readers of \\"his\\" war is fascinating and touching.<br />This book should not be missed by anyone with a serious interest in this most pivotal event of the 20th Century.	2003-01-12

This collection is an anomaly; even those who do not consider themselves fans of Mr. Diamond will delight in this compact disk if they have the slightest bit of romance in their hearts.<br />Not only has the singer chosen among the world's favorite love songs to showcase here, but this type of music shows off his range to his non-fans far more successfully than his own distinctive style does with the songs he writes himself.<br />Neil Diamond's MOVIE ALBUM pleases its listeners.	2003-01-11

Luxuriating in his text, it is easy to understand how author Ben Bradlee achieved the professional successes that he had.  He is most famous, of course, for having edited the WASHINGTON POST during the Watergate era.  The exploits of his reporters Bernstein and Woodward have been well-chronicled in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.<br />The next thing that makes A GOOD LIFE a wonderful read is that Bradlee not only has led the good life--his own definition--he's also led a fascinating one.  By some quirk of fate, he was witness to many of the more exciting events in the second half of the 20th century, and he reports on these events in a way that will rivet his fans.  <br />His description of his World War II naval career is as good as any other war memoir that I have read, and I have read quite a few.<br />Bradlee was lucky to lead his &quot;good life.&quot;  And reading about it makes for a fascinating experience.	2003-01-09

Each host proposes a dinner with a literary theme, and then the guests are assigned to the different dinners.  The hosts underwrite the events, and the guests pay the library to attend.  What these meals have in common is that they all are carefully designed, serving gourmet foods and excellent wines.<br />One set of guests may find themselves eating Moroccan cuisine in a dining room that has been turned into a tent straight out of Ali Baba.  Another group may find that their host has recreated a meal taken directly from the writings of M.F.K. Fisher.<br />TABLES OF CONTENT takes the best of the best of these parties, and assembles reports on them in this single volume.

His personal vision makes ATHLETE a fascinating book.  He has put leading athletes into poses--some of which only can make the reader wonder how he even achieved these effects--that showcase their physical strengths as well as his own genius as a photographer.<br />These are beautiful bodies, to be sure, and Schatz so successfully has objectified many of these athletes that it seems certain that some of them did not recognized themselves in the finished photographs.  The pictures must be seen, as words do not do them justice, not even those famous &quot;1000 words&quot; that a picture is said to be worth.<br />This book will appeal to anyone who admires the art of photography, and it also will interest anyone who has a love of sports.	2002-12-29

Ms. Monroe exemplified America's concepts both of beauty, and of sex appeal, in the middle of the 20th Century. As a result, THE COMPLETE LAST SITTING makes a unique and most appreciated gift for this any member of this population.<br />Photographer Bert Stern has used his camera to write Marilyn a visual love letter.

The jacket blurb notes that Ms. Holm is the mother of daughters, and the love she must feel for her own children spills over into the relationship she writes about in this novel.<br />I liked the fact that the heroine and hero are slightly older than one finds in most such romances, an accurate reflection of a now-aging general population. As with real people, Jillene and Vince bare the battle scars of life, and neither one of them is eager to begin another relationship. Holm's entire story has the ring of truth to it.<br />It is to this author's credit that her hero, and his own conflicts, are much more carefully detailed than is common in this type of book. Often, the man in a romance seems to be little more than background. Too, Vince's story is unique and intriguing.<br />My only quibble is that the hilarious personal ad that the heroine's daughters have placed on her behalf--and without her knowledge--is not pursued as thoroughly as a subplot as it could have been. What there was of this story point was, indeed, side-splittingly funny, but there just was not enough of it.<br />Nonetheless, GIRLS NIGHT never sinks into the banal and the predictable, as too many other romances do. It was charming and touching, right up to the end.	2002-12-12

As an author, Karen Robards is like the nursery rhyme about the little girl who had a little curl, right in the middle of her forehead.  When she is good, she is very, very good, and when she is bad, she is horrid.<br />IRRESISTIBLE is, indeed, very very good.  This evaluation applies only to the novel's place within the genre of historical romances, however; one cannot judge romances by the same yardstick as is used for literature.<br />Still, IRRESISTIBLE is about as good as this category of writing can get.  Robards tells an interesting story against the background of the Napoleonic Wars, and she creates a true feeling of the period.  As always, her heroine is beautiful beyond words, her hero is to drool over, and her sex scenes are hot, hot, hot.  In acknowledgment of modern values, there are no rape scenes, unlike the historical romances of decades past--and this change is a real improvement in the genre.<br />Any reader who enjoys historical romance will find IRRESISTIBLE to be... irresistible!	2002-12-10

George Burns had written a valentine to his much-loved late wife, Gracie Allen.  Because their medium was humor, and because they targeted an audience that was mainstream, it always was easy to miss that the basis of their act really was a classic love story.  This touching book makes that point clearly.<br />Last night, I attended the Broadway play in which Frank Gorshin recreates a retrospective of George Burns' career.  On the way to the theatre, I told my companion all about this memoir.  Well, the playwright must have relied heavily on this same memoir in crafting his script, because many of the anecdotes I recounted also turned up as part of the performance.  What a tribute to George's storytelling skills that my memory of this book had remained so fresh after all of these years.<br />In addition to being a memoir, GRACIE: A LOVE STORY also proves to be an excellent social history of the evolution of the entertainment industry during the 20th Century.  From vaudeville to &quot;talkies,&quot; talkies to radio and on to television and feature films, in the course of reporting his own journey, George provides an eyewitness account.  In the process, George makes his readers laugh, and he makes them weep.<br />Ultimately, however, this book about GRACIE truly is...a love story!	2002-11-16

Thus, I purchased this book due to my affection for New York City and, specifically, for the neighborhood which is featured.  Before I read this GUIDE, I had thought that I had a fairly thorough knowledge of Greenwich Village--and, actually, according to this volume, I do know quite a bit.  Yet my own knowledge is but a small fraction of the information that author Judith Stonehill presents.<br />Without question, Greenwich Village is the most fascinating corner of a fascinating city.  Its history goes back to the earliest colonial times, and its impact extends right into the present.  Stonehill covers all of the Village's incarnations, from the time that Washington Square was \\"the\\" address for the Knickerbockers, those worthy Dutch burghers, through the creative energy of the late 19th Century, right up to today.  <br />Like the city for which it started as a suburb, and of which it became an integral part, Greenwich Village has led many lives.  In four separate tours, Stonehill covers all of them.<br />According to my search on Amazon.com, this is the only book of walking tours to focus exclusively on Greenwich Village.  The small size of the book makes it perfect to tuck into a pocket or a purse when one sets out on a walk--though, to be fair, this small size requires the use of such a tiny typeface that the book can be difficult to read without magnifying glasses.<br />Nonetheless, this work is excellent as to its concept, its scope and its execution--and the artwork and photographs chosen for illustration are, indeed, exquisite.	2002-11-16

The plot turns on how our legal system, in its posture of presuming a party to be innocent under law unless that party is found guilty by an elaborate system of proofs, ends up putting the legal rights of this father ahead of the protection so direly required by the child.  In the process, author Carner explores inept and indifferent civil authorities who use their powers as a sword in excusing them from their clear moral duties.<br />PUPPET CHILD is a tale of mother love, of the occasional need for parental kidnapping when the legal system leaves no other alternatives, and of the consequences of such kidnapping.  The mother, in an episode vividly--and horrifyingly--described ends up in prison for contempt of court, and the child...well, read the book!  This is a novel worth considering.<br />Carner tells the story elegantly, and she pulls together the multitude of complex issues so that the whole thing is plausible and touching.  PUPPET CHILD is an impressive book.	2002-11-02

Consistent with Goldsmith's other novels, I had expected a romp with lots of laughs.  PEN PALS is no romp, but it also was far better than my expectations.<br />The title is slang referring to friends in prison or, in vernacular, in the pen.  Goldsmith has written an important book about the issues confronting women in prison, from the fact that so many of them somehow are victims of the men that they had been involved with, to the harshness of life inside.  Her research is impeccable and, indeed, the final pages of acknowledgments testify to her efforts.<br />Goldsmith tells the story in the voices of several different prisoners who are forced by their common situation to become each other's support system.  There is the white collar criminal, her primary heroine, who has agreed to take the rap for stock fraud committed by her boss.  There is an elegant woman (shades of Jean Harris) who killed in a crime of passion, a con woman, etc.  All of these characters are well-developed and touching.<br />PEN PALS bares some resemblance to a fairytale in its outcome; or, perhaps, it is a cautionary tale for the coming millennium.  Regardless, the novel is riveting reading and Goldsmith is to be congratulated even for tackling this subject.  That she does such a brilliant job with it simply is proof of her skill as a writer.<br />PEN PALS will make an extraordinary movie.  Congratulations, Olivia Goldsmith, on your most important work to date.	2002-11-02

Koch writes mystery stories.  Curiously, his protagonist is a character named Edward Koch who is...the Mayor of the City of New York.  <br />Basically, the books in his series are cute, nothing more, nothing less.  Yet since these stories are told in the Mayor's own highly distinctive voice, and filled with detail about the back office workings of City Hall, the mysteries nonetheless make for interesting reading.  Though the plots here are thin, a reader still will come away with new insights about the Koch administration and the governing of the City of New York.<br />In the end, Mayor Koch is not much competition for Rex Stout or Agatha Christie, but reading his New York City murder mystery series was fun.  As a New Yorker born and bred--and a full-time resident there during his entire term--I enjoyed all of these mysteries.	2002-10-21

This thinly-disguised autobiography makes for compelling reading; it almost could be a primer on surviving a spouse's marital infidelity.  As always with Ephron, her writing is facile and her insights are overwhelming.  Through the darkest moments, her own acute sense of the absurd shows through, and this humor is her salvation.<br />Anyone who merely saw the film into which this book was turned can have no sense of how wonderful the printed text proves to be.  And Ephron's recipes are fabulous, too.  HEARTBURN probably was the first novel which had recipes integrated into it.  After twenty years, I still use many of them.<br />HEARTBURN offers solid clues to the genius that Ephron is, as evidenced in her subsequent career as a screenwriter (WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, to name just one film) and as a director.	2002-10-14

GRENVILLES is \\"Dunne at his best\\" almost is not fair, since Dunne always is at his best.  This novel is a classic work by author Dunne, employing many of his trademark techniques.<br />He took the basic plot from a real-life story of great notoriety, the shooting of New York socialite William Woodward.  Did William's wife kill him?  And, if she did, was that shooting accidental?  Why would she want him dead?  These are questions which have been asked in New York for almost fifty years and, here, Dunne posits some fictionalized answers to them.<br />The title is a reference to William's mother, one of society's \\"grande dames,\\" and to his wife, who had been a member of the lower classes.  Their marriage had shocked society.<br />Dunne explores their saga in his usual lively fashion, providing the kind of detail about the lives of the rich and famous that only an insider could know.  As with all of his novels, THE TWO MRS. GRENVILLES makes for marvelous reading.	2002-10-11

To compare this book to fiction is quite a compliment to its authors.  Just as easily, they could have been reported this story as a dry and dreary episode in the chronicle of this nation's business conglomerates.<br />Instead, they focus on the very real players in these dealings, a group of people who were living large at the end of the 1980's.  This was a decade of ostentatious successes and conspicuous consumption, so these people and their lifestyles make wonderful copy.  Along the way, the authors use their stories to flesh out the cut-and-dried business machinations which made them rich and famous.<br />BARBARIANS AT THE GATE is a lively account of a very specific moment in the financial history of our nation.	2002-10-11

AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN is classic Dunne.  This is a sad little history about a mistress--the &quot;inconvenient woman&quot; of the title--whom Dunne apparently based loosely on actress Marilyn Monroe, and about her affair with a very very rich, very very social lover.  The lover, too, obviously was inspired by the saga of a famous real-life financier. <br />Like all of Dunne's books, AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN tells the tale of the rich and famous from the point of view of an observant insider; therefore, it is chock full of juicy details.  This is a book which stays with its readers long after it has been read.	2002-10-11

As a social historian, there is no one better than Wolfe.  He details his stories with an abundance of background detail that add to these stories' success in ringing chords of truth.  Wolfe also is a satirist, noting and then puncturing the bubbles of pretension that permeate every stratum of society.<br />A MAN IN FULL is a vast novel, almost Dickensonian in its scope.  It crosses the United States, in the process touching on many of the subcultures and social classes which now reside within our borders.  Wolfe never loses his pitch, crafting a plot in which every one of the multitude of detail pulls together into a cohesive whole.  He keeps the reader engrossed to the final page.	2002-10-11

He writes with an easy, readable, style while at the same time he packs his novels with an extraordinary amount of detail.<br />As he often does, Dunne took this story from the headlines, though he obviously had a deep personal connection to the plot about a murdered girl from an exclusive Connecticut town.  He never has made a secret of the fact that his own beloved daughter also was murdered.  In A SEASON IN PURGATORY, he insisted on telling the tale of the murder of Martha Moxley.  <br />Due in large part to Dunne's persistance, Michael Skakel has been tried for that murder and convicted.  A SEASON IN PURGATORY was Dunne's early fictionalized effort to refuse to let that murder remain unsolved.	2002-10-11

This novel completely captures the energy, and even the euphoria, which crept into city life during a decade that now seems far removed.<br />BONFIRE is an engrossing novel, interweaving all of the many aspects of city life, from the self-indulgences of the newly (very) rich to the struggles of the ghetto poor.  Much like that proverbial first potato chip, once a reader gets a taste of this book, it is hard to stop reading until the final resolution.  Wolfe writes a detailed and informative story in his typical lively style.<br />Anyone who wants to remember New York City during the overheated 80's will find THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES to be a clear snapshot of that time and that place.	2002-10-11

Simpson trial, it actually is far more significant than the news event it purportedly documents.<br />There is no escaping that this \\"novel\\" (in the form of a \\"memoir,\\" the cover of the book tells buyers) is a personal anecdote about author Dominick Dunne.  As a result, it is self-revelatory in the extreme.  Dunne does not spare himself when he recounts his life.  The story of his marriage, and of his daughter's murder, inescapably are touching.  Once this novel--or memoir--has been completed, these are the details which stay with a reader, not the additional account of the Simpson trial.<br />There is no escaping that Dunne was born under some combined influence of stars and planets which has planted him, over and over, in places which allowed him to witness, from the inside, some of the most important social events of the 20th century.  As a result, his memoir makes for fascinating reading.	2002-10-11

On reflection, fiction can meet many needs.  It can inform, it can entertain and amuse, it can uplift by the very beauty of its language.  HOMEMAKERS does none of these things.<br />The premise of the story is to follow the lives of several women whose husbands all are stationed at the same U.S. Airforce base in England in the years immediately after World War II.  The narrator is one of these women.<br />Of course, the years that come separate the women, so the report is very much through this narrator's eyes as she receives the occasional letter or Christmas card from others in the group.  In the end, the ladies lead lives that are predictable, as do most people, filled with marital infidelity and illness and problem children. There is nothing special about their separate tales.<br />Predictably, there is the abusive husband, the brave young man who dies for his country--&quot;kilt,&quot; as the author would phrase it, in her attempt to write uneducated, American English--the love affairs and divorces.  Only a suplot about an inherited disease is original.<br />From the author's biography, it seems as if Laurie Graham is an Englishwoman, yet she has chosen to write this book in the phrasing of an uneducated female raised in America's south during the first part of the 20th century.  Graham does a good job of capturing this character's voice, and her spirit.  Yet just as there is nothing uplifting about this story, there is nothing lyrical about the author's use of language.<br />Additionally, problems with transposing British English with the American version creep into the book.  At a hospital in Texas, one puts one's automobile in the &quot;parking lot,&quot; not in the &quot;car park.&quot;  In Manhattan, an address of &quot;60th Street and 9th Avenue&quot; actually is &quot;Columbus&quot; Avenue, since 9th Avenue ends, and Columbus begins, at 59th Street, a/k/a &quot;Columbus Circle.&quot;  A reference to a hometown of &quot;Corona&quot; probably should have explained in exactly which part of the States this Corona was located, since her hometown was relevant to this character's development.  Eventually, the text did reveal that it was the Corona in Queens, New York, but it also could have been the Corona in California.  Shouldn't an editor based in the USA have read this work in the manuscript stage?<br />Ultimately, this novel is about the optimism of youth subsequently dissipated by dealing with life's mundane and, often, grim realities. And, ultimately, there is nothing special enough about THE FUTURE HOMEMAKERS OF AMERICA to make it into worthwhile reading.  There are many, many books which do a better job with this kind of multi-decade chronicle focusing on multiple characters, from THE FORSYTE SAGA to THE DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD.	2002-10-09

No author crafts a better trip than Jane Graves, one of the genre's rising stars.<br />WILD AT HEART opens with the best first chapter ever; no one who reads those early pages will be able to put down this novel.  Graves is a master, with a such a command of language that she sculpts her sentences as much as she writes them.<br />There is a lively and riveting plot.  One of Jane Graves' greatest skills is that she takes a storyline that is implausible, but not impossible, and she makes it actually seem very likely.  The scenes at the small town Texas fair and the game preserve as so visual that they beg for a movie, maybe with George Clooney and Julia Roberts in the leads.<br />The earlier book featuring the de Marco brothers cried for a sequel; this sequel calls for a screenplay.  And the notes at the back promise that a third novel in this series already is in the works.  Terrific!	2002-10-04

Hitchcock writes about what passes for high society in modern-day New York.  Knowledgable readers will have a lot of fun identifying all of the mimimally disguised characters and places in this book.<br />Hitchcock pokes fun at many of this society's pretensions, such as when she uses the heroine's fascination with Marie Antoinette as a counterpoint for the basic plot.  Wait!  Wasn't it Mrs. G, the former stewardess, who went French on &quot;tout New York&quot; exactly as the heroine, a former restaurant hostess, herself does in SOCIAL CRIMES?<br />This story is stunning in its cleverness, and it is a credit to Ms. Hitchcock's fertile imagination.  She hangs this entire novel on the one loophole under New York estate law that obviates a spouse's absolute right to claim a share of inheritance under the will of the deceased husband or wife, and she uses this loophole with brilliance.  Hitchcock's storytelling skills are wonderful.<br />SOCIAL CRIMES is a fun read that leaves one thinking after the book concludes.	2002-10-03

She was a political activist in an era when the opinion of women neither was sought nor welcomed--and her influence was not inconsiderable--she had such a severe gambling problem that her losses all but bankrupted the (very rich) Duchy of Devonshire.<br />As always, Amanda Foreman's research is impeccable, and her writing style so lively that this biography is as gripping as good fiction.

I was not disappointed.  Ms. Weiner is gifted.<br />IN HER SHOES has a more complicated plot than the other story, and the characters in this later work are realized more fully.  Part of the charm of GOOD IN BED was its fairytale quality, which is not an element of IN HER SHOES.  <br />Instead, SHOES features two sisters whose mother had died when they were young.  At least partly as a consequence of being raised by a wicked stepmother (the only lapse into classic fairytale in this book) the sisters each have serious and distinctive emotional problems which they must surmount.  The characters of these two sisters are well-developed, and believable, and altogether touching.  In common with GOOD IN BED, IN HER SHOES offers heroines who are strong and pro-active, a nice change from all of the many self-involved Bridget Jones-type protagonists.<br />Ms. Weiner has conceived a clever plot here, and she reveals it in a slow and deliberate manner, telling a tale that seems altogether plausible.  She has a marvelous eye for details of accuracy and a marvelous ear for dialogue.  Her storytelling skills are lovely, and I look forward to seeing what next flows from her word processor.	2002-09-26

In fact, its greatest problem is that it's too clever.  <br />Its protagonist is too cutesy, the protagnist's snap responses are too quick and too hokey.  This is a shame, because author Tamar Myers obviously is a gifted writer of mysteries. <br />This story is complicated and interesting: Myers' details about Charleston, where the tale is set, and about collectible crystal and antique shops, all seem accurate and these really are quite interesting.  Her ear for dialogue, even when that dialogue is strained, is excellent.  <br />Thus, the overly cute tone bogs down what actually is a very good mystery, rather than enhancing it, as had to have been Ms. Myers' intent.  SPLENDOR IN THE GLASS--even the name is cutesy--is a good book.  Yet this novel misses being great, and SPLENDOR did have the potential to be more than it was.	2002-09-26

For a change from the dozens of whiney single-girl books out there, GOOD IN BED has an interesting plot.  The writing itself is excellent, and the author is full of insights as to the lifestyles of bright young women in our modern world.  <br />Cannie, the heroine, is endearing and even admirable.  Her issues with weight and her casual attitude towards sex may not appeal to every reader, however.  <br />There also is a fairytale quality to the whole book, with unlikely but delightful adventures constantly falling upon Cannie.  Yet, at the end, that's what this plot is, a modern-day fairytale.<br />GOOD IN BED is a book that is impossible to put down; I finished it in one reading.	2002-09-16

To reinforce the points she is making, Stone interviews experts such as psychologists, as well as famous people who are conspicuous in their singleness, like comedienne (and widow)Joan Rivers.  <br />The author illustrates these points with anecdotal reports.  The lively writing and the constructive suggestions make A WOMAN'S GUIDE TO LIVING ALONE nothing less than a primer for millions of women who find themselves single again in mid-life.	2002-09-14

From the title through the final page, this novel had the potential to be terrific.  <br />Like the title, the underlying premise of the story is clever.  MOURNING GLORY tells of the quest of a down-on-her-luck divorcee who decides that she will find husband number two by haunting the funeral parlors of a wealthy town.  She hopes that she will be able to focus in on a heartbroken widower desperate for the attention of a good woman before the other predatory women of the community can get to him.<br />This story should have been great, it should have been funny.  As it was, the novel only is distasteful.  While there's nothing wrong with Mr. Adler's writing, it was odd to see a book with a 2001 pub date mention Bonwit Teller's, a New York based department store that has been out of business for about twenty years.  Where was his editor?  Also, \\"garter belts\\" are consistently referred to as \\"suspenders,\\" and a sex toy consistently is called by a technical term that women do not use.  <br />The sole compliment that I can find for MOURNING GLORY is that, for a change, the heroine is not just some young girl with firm breasts whose worst problem is a broken fingernail.  It would have been nice if the author could have offered a more thorough description of Palm Beach, where he places this novel, and which is a unique and interesting town.<br />Finally, the sex scenes just...lie there.  To compound the problem, the sex is pretty repetitive as well.  Virtually any of the female romance writers do better with these episodes.  Anyone who wants to read a juicy romance should buy something by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Nora Roberts, Elizabeth Lowell, Rachel Gibson, Jane Graves.  There is a vast group of authors who do a superior job with this type of story.	2002-09-11

What a pity that, out of all of the romance novels in print, Kelly Ripa of the television show LIVE WITH REGIS & KELLY chose this novel for her \\"trashy\\"--her own term--book club.<br />To be fair, there is nothing wrong with Ms. Phillips' writing, but there is nothing special about her prose, either.  Her language is not elegant and the story itself is so thin as to be little more than a glorified outline.  It's implausible as well--\\"the bachelor\\" is a foreign correspondent who is being lured by no less a publication than the WASHINGTON POST--and the outcome is predictable.  It is consistent with the lack of effort evidenced that the characters in this novel neither are interesting nor well-developed.<br />And her sex scenes, in a genre in which the sex sizzles, barely are adequate.  A reader wishing to see how a skilled romance writer does the job should open anything written by that other Phillips, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, or by Nora Roberts or Elizabeth Lowell or Rachel Gibson or Jane Graves or Linda Howard or...well, there are dozens of authors who do a better job with this kind of novel.<br />THE BACHELOR wasn't bad, but it also was far from terrific.	2002-09-11

I had thoroughly enjoyed OUR HUSBAND, Stephanie Bond's earlier book, so I expected to like I THINK I LOVE YOU.

Ms. Bond lets the reader know right from the beginning that she was inspired by the Nancy Drew mysteries of our collective youths, and I THINK I LOVE YOU is very much a Nancy Drew book for the modern woman.<br />The tension among the three sisters who are the focus of this novel is altogether plausible, and its history is well-explained.  The separate plots concerning each of the three sisters also are compelling, and the backstory of small town Southern life is extremely interesting.  I was awed by Ms. Bond's imagination and I cannot wait to read the sequel that the final pages of this novel promise already is in the works.	2002-09-03

Since the story was set during the last years of the life of Queen Victoria, who was \\"HER Majesty,\\" then her eldest son, Albert Edward, still was only the Prince of Wales, not yet King Edward VII.  Therefore his proper honorific would have been \\"His Royal Highness.\\"  In light of all of the other seemingly accurate facts in the story, this error was jarring.<br />The mystery was charming, however, at least insofar as murder can be charming.  It was set in a now-gone world of manners and rules.  The part of the tale which involves thoroughbred horse racing and the stakes involved actually was a primer in the evolution of this sport.<br />I enjoyed DEATH AT EPSOM DOWNS, and I plan to read the other books in this series.	2002-08-27

It is a story to be read, to be considered, and to be savored.<br />As it begins, Kayleigh \\"Leigh\\" Fallon is the wife of a Congressman from Ohio and the mother of three terrific children.  Her husband neglects her, barely acknowledging her existence and ignoring her personal achievements as his helpmate and as a successful commercial illustrator.<br />Things change for Leigh when the family takes in an exchange student from Norway.  He turns out to be a graduate student, older than the traditional exchange student, and a hunk at that.<br />At the beginning, Leigh ignores her attraction to this young man, but after she discovers evidence of her husband's affair, she has a tryst of her own.<br />What begins as a fling becomes a great love which, of course, disrupts Leigh's neatly ordered existence.  EAST OF THE SUN, WEST OF THE MOON (which is the title of a famous Norwegian fairy tale, the author explains) details the consequences of their relationship on the lovers, and also on the other people affected by the changes their relationship brings, principally Leigh's children and her lover's family.  Like classic literature, the story is complicated, and some incidental characters turn out to have a great impact on the heroine's life.<br />The sex scenes, not insignificantly, are beautifully written, both elegant and passionate.  These scenes are plausible and believable in ways that are uncommon in women's fiction.<br />EAST OF THE SUN, WEST OF THE MOON is in the tradition of the classic novels.  It is a fascinating tale of one woman's journey to happiness, and it is a great love story as well.	2002-08-26

Her descriptions of Los Angeles, its pretensions and affectations, all are particularly hilarious.  Since I lived in LA briefly myself, I know how accurate Keyes has been in capturing its rhythms.<br />Unlike so many women's novels, ANGELS does not rely on heavyhanded foreshadowing.  Many of the motivating incidents are revealed to the reader unceremoniously, and even the ending is a surprise.  As a reader, I found these techniques a refreshing change from the norm, a change which made for an unusally rich reading experience.<br />ANGELS is a funny and believable novel.	2002-08-11

The writing, as always with this author, is excellent.<br />The only problem is that the characters are not that interesting.  Whether it's that these characters simply are \\"too\\" nice, with not enough bite--when the hero and heroine get angry with one another, their rages seem rather polite--or whether it's that the plot turns are too remote for the average reader to be able to identify with them, it would be difficult to say.  Inescapably, however, THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR is not Ms. Delinsky's finest work; COAST ROAD and LAKE NEWS both were markedly superior.  <br />Yet even some of Ms. Delinsky's less successful efforts still make for a good read.

KINDLY REFER TO THE \\"AMAZON.COM\\" MASTER REVIEW BEFORE READING THIS CRITIQUE<br />Susan Elizabeth Phillips has been a great favorite--if not \\"the\\" favorite--of romance readers for several decades.  With the publication of BREATHING ROOM, she now enters the mainstream.<br />BREATHING ROOM is a lush novel, set in Tuscany.  The heroine is one of those media-types who quickly had evolved into an industy and the hero is the ultimate bad boy with the soft heart.  There is no one, no one at all, who writes these bad boys better than Ms. Phillips does.<br />The story is far more complex and layered than Ms. Phillips' earlier novels, and it transcends the rigid parameters of romance writing.  No question but that it is romantic, but it's also a lovesong to Italy, to that country's fascinating history, its people, its cuisine and, especially, its gorgeous terrain.<br />Not incidentally, there is no other author who writes the sexy scenes better; there is no other author who does a better \\"boy meets girl\\" opening.  That situation in BREATHING ROOM took skill and vision to create, and a seasoned and assured author even to imagine.<br />Mainstream readers who like a unique story with, yes, a little romance, will enjoy BREATHING ROOM every bit as much as Ms. Phillips long-faithful fans.

The first two were marvelous, the next two were...less marvelous.  LOLA CARLYLE REVEALS ALL, Gibson's fifth book, is almost as good as those first two.  Actually, heroine Lola Carlyle bears more than a slight resemblance to Georgeanne, the heroine of that first story.<br />Within the formula of romance writing, LOLA CARLYLE is extremely well-done.  For more than half the book, there are just two characters, Lola and Max.  (Okay, and Lola's cute little dog.)  Nonetheless, once a reader accepts the premise, the story becomes neither strained nor implausible, and neither does the dialogue.<br />Gibson has done a great deal of research for this book, and it shows.  In fact, the deeper details rival the kind of work that author Nelson DeMille offers, though he doesn't write romances--so, by definition, his stories are more complex.<br />Still, for the romance genre, Gibson's background research is unique and outstanding.  One cannot read this book without learning a little bit about drug smugglers, government enforcement agencies, or modern-day pirates in the Caribbean.  The biggest flaw in this book is that the information offered about Lola's career as a New York-based top fashion model is far more superficial than the crime subplot.<br />Everything considered, LOLA CARLYLE REVEALS ALL is a terrific read!	2002-05-31

PLEASE REFER TO THE BASIC \\"AMAZON\\" REVIEW IN READING THE FOLLOWING:<br />TRUST FUND BABIES has a fascinating premise, this premise being that three first cousins who have inherited a significant fortune have had that fortune embezzled by their joint business manager.  The novel explores how the loss of a fortune this size impacts each of these three women.  In the course of telling her story, author Jean Stone offers some fascinating insights into the way that the very rich live their lives.<br />Some of this story is set on Martha's Vineyard, and Stone communicates a wonderful sense of place.  Though her writing is excellent, and TRUST FUND BABIES is fast-paced, there are many conceptual flaws that ultimately make this book seem pointless, however.  <br />First of all, there's the mystery of the little girl who is abandoned by her family and the eventual explanation of why the abandonment took place.  There is the couple who stayed together for no obvious reason, except maybe that they had a child together, and then split up in the weeks immediately preceeding that child's wedding, compromising the social aspects of the event.  Too, there is the man who turns out to have married his wife knowing the deep, dark secrets she thought she had concealed, with no reason offered for his over-riding love for her.  And, finally, there is the way in which the socialite friends of one of the cousins drop her when word gets out that she has lost her fortune.  I find it difficult to imagine an entire clique abandoning someone solely because of a change in net worth.  <br />Also, none of the characters are developed as thoroughly as they deserve to be, though the socialite does come the closest to being a real person.  And an \\"Agnes Gooch\\" type personal assistant, a la AUNTIE MAME, never grows into the fuller formed personality that author Stone hints that she will come to be.<br />As interesting as is the premise with which TRUST FUND BABIES starts off, the story itself quicklybecomes strained and implausible.  This is a pity, because Jean Stone is an excellent writer.	2002-05-28

Fleshing out any of these issues would have made for a better romance, and addressing all of the issues would have made for a great novel.<br />Still, SWEETHEARTS OF THE TWILIGHT LANES is a charming novel, well-written, and with endearing characters.  Having been raised in New York City myself, I loved the glimpse it offered into small-town Southern life.<br />I hope that with her next book, Luanne Jones' publisher and editor will allow her to tell more of a tale.	2002-02-07

Let's get this clear at the start: There are few authors of women's fiction who can sculpt a sentence as well as Alex Witchel can.  This information will not come as news to her legion of admirers from her years of writing for the NEW YORK TIMES, but those who first are discovering Ms. Witchel are in for a treat.<br />In ME TIMES THREE, however, reading the prose which flows from Ms. Witchel's keyboard simply is a bonus.  This is a novel which is compelling because of the story she weaves.  Unlike many similar tales, her heroine actually is endearing and the adventures of this heroine become compelling.<br />Furthermore, the where and when of the novel, Manhattan at the end of the 1980's, was a moment of great energy, a moment that now has receded into ancient history.  The women of SEX & THE CITY still were in middle school when this story takes place.  ME TIMES THREE reminds us that other people walked those same streets before the SEX girls arrived in THE CITY. <br />For anyone who was, ahem, \\"there,\\" ME TIMES THREE is filled with easily identifiable characters whose presence makes the whole book even more fun.  <br />Read this novel for pleasure, for history, for the sociology of a particular subculture, a snapshot of a time and place.  Just do yourself a favor and read it!	2002-02-04

Author Tracy Chevalier has written a novel in the first person, her narrator being a sixteen-year old girl who is forced, due to her own family's dire finances, to work as a maid for the family of the 17th century painter Johannes Vermeer.<br />In the voice of the heroine, Chevalier reveals how difficult life was in those long-ago days.  She never is maudlin, however, nor even obvious.  This is a quiet book, which the reader will have to study for its nuances. <br />Oddly, in the peculiar way of coincidences, this book came out very close in time to GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE.  Not only are these titles similar, but both of these books engage in fictional explorations of particular aspects of the life of Vermeer.  Read together, these two books are as good as a class on the Old Masters.	2002-01-13

This participation probably is more of a requirement with romance novels which, bluntly, tend to have more fanciful foundations for their stories than do mainstream fiction.<br />In I GOT YOU, BABE, once the reader buys into the motivating force of this plot, that the heroine has been framed for an armed robbery of a convenience store, the rest of the book flows quite logically.  BABE is well-conceived and well-written, with an endearing damsel-in-distress and the prototypical hero who is firm but true.  The supporting characters are hilarious.<br />When the immovable object meets the irresistable force, sparks are sure to fly, so the sex scenes in this book are hot, hot, hot.<br />This is a first novel of enormous promise, and I look forward to the sequel.	2002-01-13

Yet that's what happened to me with DADAH MEANS DEATH.<br />      This is a Ludlum and DeMille style thriller, definitely top class.  Unlike many lesser works, the story never becomes implausible or contrived.<br />      The hero is a retired British army officer sent by the classic rich Englishman to see what has happened to the man's beloved granddaughter, who has gone missing in Malaysia.  That there is a drug involvement, in a big way, and a choice of bad guys, goes almost without saying.<br />       According to the jacket blurb, author Jonathan Linn is, himself, a retired British army officer.  Without a doubt, he has logged his time in Malaysia, because this mystery only could have been written by someone with a bone-deep knowledge of that part of the world.<br />       This book must be made into a movie--I can't wait to see it.

Her books are clever and quick-moving.<br />GETTING RID OF BRADLEY is a re-issue of an earlier novel, and it will delight her newer fans who missed the book on its first go-round.<br />Her characters are distinctive and well-developed, and the plot is far more detailed than in most conventional romances.  Heroine Lucy Savage is endearing and compelling, with foibles that seem all too real.  The dogs are real and compelling, also.  Reading Ms. Crusie's CV on the back of the jacket, it is easy to understand how she has become such a star in her field.<br />The only complaint is that once this plot reached its inevitable climax--every pun intended--the story becomes more about lust than about mystery.  This is a pity, because Jennifer Crusie has crafted a romance novel that has far more depth than the genre usually requires.	2001-12-14

As such, it is the ultimate romance novel.<br />The reader must remember that romance novels follow a certain structure.  There is only one primary plot, the heroine of that plot always is beautiful, there must be a happy ending.  So it is more difficult rather than less for an author to stay within these limitations and still turn out a compelling novel.<br />Yet Ms. Phillips manages to pen a winner every single time one of her books hits the stockrooms of the retailers.  The reason for this success is simple: The woman can write!<br />By the explanation in her foreward, JUST IMAGINE is the reworking of her first published novel, which was written at a moment in time when the ethics were different than now.<br />Nonetheless, even in this more moderate, politically correct version, no one creates sexual tension better than SEP, or sustains that conflict long past the point where the reader's interest should remain engaged.<br />With it, Ms. Phillips spins a fine yarn about the South in those immediate years after the Civil War.

Anyone who has seen the movie version of this novel and liked that movie probably will like the written story even better.  And even people who found the film annoying may well find that they are more amused by the book.  BRIDGET JONES' DIARY is a fast-paced and clever concept that makes for entertaining reading.<br />DIARY was the volume that started the trend of &quot;City Girl&quot; plotlines, east side of the Atlantic series. (The<BR>west side of the Atlantic movement is headed by SEX &amp; THE CITY.) The print version of DIARY is funnier and quicker than the movie was, and some of the changes of detail which were made to have a film that was more correct politically damaged the pacing of the story.<br />DIARY is not unique; while it was early in the genre, there also are other, similar, works which are almost as good.  In fact, MAKING MINTY MALONE is so similar that it almost seems like the two authors must have written each of their manuscripts as part of an assignment for the same writing class.  Still, DIARY remains the dispositive work about the over-educated, urban, young and unmarried career woman in these opening years of the new millennium.	2001-12-04

In THE PRINCESS DIARIES, she takes a preposterous plot and somehow makes it completely plausible.  <br />     Her heroine is a teenage New Yorker who is not as spoiled as the typical &quot;Manhattan princess.&quot;  She attends a pricy New York prep school.  I personally know several girls who could be this heroine's classmates, so I can say that Cabot, in describing this population, captures their dialect and their rhythms perfectly.<br />     Cabot also captures plenty of other New York detail as well, such as the husband-and-wife psychiatric team who name their shetland sheepdog &quot;Pavlov.&quot;  Indeed, the sheltie was the breed that Pavlov used in his conditioning experiments.<br />     THE PRINCESS DIAIRES offers plenty of belly-laughes and a story which can be read by both grandmother and teenage granddaughter with no discomfort.

Setting her story on the lovely little island of Nantucket, Hilderbrand does an excellent job in displaying the charms of this island, and even in explaining the peculiar joys of island life in general.  I know this for a fact, because I live in a similar community.<br />     The novel opens as a summer season begins and the tale concludes as the season ends.  The goings-on at a deluxe oceanfront resort form the spine of the plot.<br />     With as many characters as a Dickens' classic, Hilderbrand explores the loves and travails of both the resort's long-suffering staff and of the transient guests.  Indeed, one flaw is that the reader is teased with snippets of the problems some the paying guests.  Yet, repeatedly, these fragments never are brought to a natural conclusion, since these characters' adventures at THE BEACH CLUB end when the characters depart the hotel...as resort guests inevitably do.<br />     The core characters, alas, are not as fully developed as they could be, and neither do most of them prove particularly likable.  Of course, this lack of likability makes the novel less enjoyable than it would have been with compelling characters.  Still, Ms. Hilderbrand is to be complimented for taking a story with an ultimately predictable conclusion and making it into something unexpected.<br />       Perhaps an author as skilled as this onewould have served her novel better with fewer primary characters, and better development of those who remained.  There is no escaping that Hilderbrand is an excellent story-teller and a gifted writer, and that THE BEACH CLUB is an excellent read.  Anyone with an appreciation of Nantucket or similar island resorts will find that THE BEACH CLUB resonates.	2001-11-24

An enormous amount of research had to have gone into this novel, and it shows.  There are multiple sets of historical detail, any one set of which would have been sufficient for a compelling manuscript.<br />     First, there is the background of life in Cuba before Fidel Castro came to power.  There is the conflict of those who made their escape from Fidel's Cuba and the report of life in Cuba today.  And there is the story of the life of the Cuban immigrant to the United States.  All of these subplots are revealed skillfully by the author.<br />     Additionally, there is the far lesser known history of the &quot;Marranos,&quot; the Jews of Medieval Spain who pretended to become Christians to escape the Inquisition.  Five centuries later, some of these Marranos yet have descendants who are practicing, still in hiding, their version of the Jewish religion.  Some of those persecuted in 1492 made their ways to Cuba--even on the ships of Columbus--and the father of the heroine of this novel is descended from one of these very refugees.<br />     So this is a book that comes close to greatness.  The main characters never succeed in engaging the reader, however.  And, ultimately, the story arc itself seems pointless.  Still, the virtue of DAYS OF AWE is in the details.	2001-11-01

Yet LONG TIME NO SEE still may be her best book in years.  Her heroine, Judith Singer, whom Issacs' devoted readers first met in COMPROMISING POSITIONS, has aged beautifully.  Around this amateur sleuth--Miss Marples if Miss Marples were a Donna Karan-clad, card-carrying member of Weight Watchers living in an affluent New York suburb--Issacs has constructed a mystery.  Not to mince words, a brilliant mystery.  The tale is both intricate and plausible, and never obvious.  <br />     Issacs tells her story with insights--brilliant insights-- practically one on each page; as an observer, Issacs possesses the keenest eye.  In the course of Judith's grand adventure, Issacs gets inside the heads of menopausal women, revealing truths about middle-aged passion.  This author's turns of phrase are, yes, brilliant as well as singular, making for dialogue that's fun.  This compelling novel is good to the last page.	2001-10-01

Her heroine has an outlook on life and a turn of phrase so clever that this character borders on genius. Still, the romance genre itself is limiting. THIRD TIME LUCKY conforms to the genre with a single storyline that is linear and ultimately predictable. There is an additional plot about the heroine's business partner that could have been expanded, but that would have taken the novel outside the limitations of romance novels. Also, the mystery which drives this tale wasn't explored thoroughly enough to be exciting, though the book starts with great promise. Nonetheless, THIRD TIME LUCKY is an easy read, and a fun one.  I look forward to Ms. Cross's next book in this series.	2001-09-15

There are points when she is detailing what it feels like to be a florist, to love the flowers, their scents, their colors, the spill of the soil, at which her writing is lyrical.<br />Though the novel is a love-story, it never becomes predictable, and that's quite a trick.  Author Ray's subplots are compelling; her incidental characters are well-developed and interesting.<br />Altogether, JULIE &amp; ROMEO is a touching book, and a fun one.

This is not so when Vince Lardo is the author.  I am one of his greatest fans and I especially like the fact that in his &quot;Hamptons&quot; series, the reader never knows where the story is going.<br />Mr. Lardo has an amazing eye for detail.  As a resident of East Hampton, the town about which he writes, I can say that he gets things right.  He doesn't miss a trick, making one of his books as good as a week's vacation in these parts.<br />The way he moves among narrators is excellent, developing his stories from different characters' points of view, and staying with each of their voices.  There is a stillness to THE HAMPTONS CONNECTION, a pervasive sense of foreboding.<br />Mr. Lardo also took over the &quot;Archy McNally&quot; mysteries, set in Palm Beach, when their creator died.  These books are great fun, maybe even more fun than the Hamptons series.  The Archy books are meant to be as frothy as champagne and so they are.  The Hamptons novels are far more compelling, and they stay in a reader's memory in the same way in which a fine red wine does.<br />Depending on one's mood, Vincent Lardo is an author for all seasons.	2001-06-27

That Ruth Reichl is an excellent writer is proven by her career, as she moved east from reviewing restaurants in California to doing the same for the NEW YORK TIMES, on to her current position as Editor-in-Chief of GOURMET Magazine.  There is no question that the quality of her prose makes TENDER AT THE BONE a quick-paced and fascinating read.<br />By her own account, Reichl's parents politely would be described as &quot;eccentric.&quot;  This eccentricity led them unceremoniously to dump her in a boarding school in Montreal, indifferent to the fact that French was spoken there exclusively, while their Ruth talked only English.  Of course, the situation forced Ruth into learning French, which she came to speak with fluency.  And this fluency greatly has assisted her with her career in the food industry.<br />Her mother was a dreadful cook and, even worse, she was a dangerous one.  Reichl's report of the party her mother had hosted which ended with two dozen guests being admitted to the hospital with food poisoning is hilarious, just as long as the reader also wasn't one of that group of guests.<br />Therefore, not surprisingly, her parents failed to notice Ruth's keen appreciation of good cooking.  Her epiphany came when she was a guest at the home of one of her French-Canadian classmates, and her description of this revelation is writing at its best.<br />TENDER AT THE BONE is a linear tracking of events which formed the woman Ruth Reichl became, each event illustrated by a food anecdote which displays the evolution of her growing appreciation of high-level cuisine.  By some fortuitous quirks of fate, Reichl has been in the right places at the right times, such as Northern California when cooks there--she among them--were giving form to fine American cookery.<br />Ruth Reichl is food writing royalty and, in consequence, her memoir makes for delicious reading.	2001-05-22

So often in those books that are grouped as &quot;category romances,&quot; the reader finds flimsy and absurd plotlines...minimal and often inaccurate detail--especially in works with historical settings...and just plain poor writing.  HOMESPUN HEARTS is the opposite, a winner on every level.<br />Author Cynthia Thomason does a wonderful job of describing smalltown Ohio at the turn of the 20th Century, one of those singular times and places which exemplified the values which came to shape our nation.  <br />Her characters, especially the hero and heroine, are real and lovable.  And those other folks who people their town just prove Thomason's theory that human nature hasn't changed much over the centuries.<br />Thomason has done plenty of research, and it shows, as when she takes her characters to the Chicago Exposition to marvel over everything that then was new and wonderful.  In one subplot of this complex novel, she has integrated John D. Rockefeller into her story.<br />Readers of HOMESPUN HEARTS will be engaged in Thomason's touching story, and they surely will cheer every twist and turn that brings the tale to its inevitable conclusion.<br />I can't wait to read all of this author's other books.  HOMESPUN HEARTS belongs in the classification of the best of the best!	2001-05-22

Perhaps if my expectations had been less, I would have liked &quot;DIVINE SECRETS&quot; even better than I did.<br />And yet, I did like the book well enough.  Purportedly, the protagonist is a woman who always has had a strained relationship with her own mother.  The details unfold when she is given her mother's diary to read.  Through this device, it becomes clear that the story only is about the younger woman indirectly; it actually hinges on the woman's mother and the mother's three best friends since all three were girls.<br />As such, this is a novel about friendship, about caring, about support among women.   Ultimately, it also is a story about love.  All of tale is told with a wonderful Louisiana accent; author Rebecca Wells imparts a wonderful sense of place.  In all, DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD is a worthwhile read.	2001-04-16

It's a fairy tale with all sorts of wonderful and magical things befalling the main characters.  It's an allegory in which nice guys finish first.  And it's an old-fashioned romance.  All of these subtexts are placed in the setting of proverbial English country town.  There are multiple mysteries, with a great train robbery, murder attempts and terrorist bombs.  The whole combine to create a terrific romp, a true modernization of the English country mystery, starting right from one of the best opening sentences in the history of writing.  I look forward to reading Beaton's other books.	2001-04-16

For five minutes, the reporters have their moment of glory until the public interest quickly wanes.  At that point, the media goes on to other news, leaving the life or lives of those featured in these stories in tatters.  The heroine of LAKE NEWS has been slandered in just such a fashion and this premise makes for interesting reading.<br />As always with Ms. Delinsky, she conveys a marvelous sense of place, here a lakeside resort deep in New England.  Her characters are drawn from the small group of families which make up the year-round population.<br />Her writing, as ever, is fluid...her characters are likable and believable...and her concept is fascinating.

This sequel is far more poorly conceived and developed.  It is only because of Brockmann's basic writing skills that THE DEFIANT HERO deserves even three stars.  <br />Her research is excellent, as alway.  One cannot help wondering if Suzanne Brockmann herself has done high level intelligence work, so compelling are these details.  And, again, her flashback sequences to World War II are fascinating.  Yet even the flashbacks, I regret to say, had a more believable plot in UNSUNG HEROES.<br />Here, the premise strains credulity.  The daughter of a U.S. diplomat is kidnapped and the diplomat turns to a Navy SEAL she had met on an earlier mission for rescue.  These two people, according to an underlying premise of this novel, had fallen in love at first sight.  And even in this strained situation, they cannot refrain from having wonderful sex, despite the horrible circumstance by which they are trapped.  Ms. Brockmann, as always, does a wonderful job with the sex scenes.<br />I will await her next book with interest.	2001-04-15

After the publication of her breakthrough bestseller, THE FIRST WIVES CLUB, her output has been uneven, to say the least.  There have been a couple of gems; MARRYING MOM and THE BESTSELLER come to mind.  Yet since WIVES, nothing else she has written comes close to evoking the contemporary feel of a particular moment in a particular place, well leavened by humor, as much as BAD BOY does.<br />This book has one of those high concept storylines: Two twenty-somethings, friends since college, are the main characters.  They agree that the male of the pair, a sweet and gentle geek and techno-millionaire, will be made over into a stud by the trendy girl he still sees every week over brunch.<br />Often, these high concept stories are clever and compelling but, once established, there is not enough to say about them to fill a compelling novel.  Not so with BAD BOY.  Ms. Goldsmith has written a novel that tracks beautifully and makes for an easy and funny read.  Even though anyone older than twelve will predict the ending, it doesn't matter, because this story is in the details.<br />Her research appears to be excellent.  This 40-something author has caught the energy of Gen-Y, or at least so it seems to a 40-something reader.  And, if there are a few quibbles, they don't affect the texture of the story.  True, the heroine never seems to work.  According to the plot, she is a reporter at a daily Seattle newspaper but over the course of this novel she writes only four &quot;fluff&quot; round-ups...comes in late...leaves early...and takes long lunches.  Even allowing for artistic license, this is a bit of stretch.<br />Ms. Goldsmith doesn't write sex scenes with as much detail as some of her bestselling sisters but, in BAD BOY, this does not detract from the story.  In fact, this novel screams: Screenplay! Welcome back, Olivia Goldsmith.	2001-04-15

Too often, biographers attempt to do such a conscientious job describing their subjects that the books about those subjects end up being dull.  And it should go without saying that those subjects, in real life, were anything but dull.  Had they been less than interesting, no one would be tempted to write their stories and there would be no buyers for the finished biographies. Something like that has happened with FIVE SISTERS, the story of the famous Langhorne sisters of Virginia.<br />Author James Fox, who already has proved his skills as a writer in his other works, is well-assisted in this book due to the fact that he, himself, is the grandson of one of these Five Sisters.  As such, he had access to family papers and correspondence unavailable in the public records.<br />The sisters were born into a prominent Southern family impoverished by the Civil War.  The most famous sister, Nancy Astor, married the heir of William Waldorf Astor and became the first American woman elected to the English parliament.  In a word, she was a character.  Another sister, the most beautiful of the group, married artist Charles Dana Gibson.  Very literally, as his model, she became the personification of the Edwardian concept of feminine beauty, the &quot;Gibson Girl.&quot;<br />As described by James Fox, the women appear to be fairly typical in their sisterly concerns and rivalries.  Nancy Astor sounds odd (to be kind) as well as nasty.  And the book, FIVE SISTERS, somehow manages to be less than engaging.  Nonetheless, Fox makes a serious contribution to detailing the social history of the lifestyle of the aristocracy in England at the turn of the 20th Century.	2001-04-07

In it, author Jonathan Hull combines three separate tales, seamlessly moving among them.  <br />Story #1 is the most powerful, a first-hand report of a young soldier sent to the front during World War I.  War never can be lyrical, yet Hull manages to share its horrors with a command of language that is masterful, interspersed with quotes from original sources which provide additional appalling details.  The author captures the euphoria of the young soldiers evident in all first-hand accounts of the troops going into battle, but he also describes the terror of battle so well that it becomes difficult to continue reading.  It almost is beyond comprehension how someone born about 40 years after the events being described, as Hull appears to have been from his jacket photo, could bring these battles to life so effectively.<br />Story #2 is the fast forward, to the young soldier, the rare survivor of those World War I battles, now grown old and living in a nursing home.  He has developed into a man of insight and compassion, a thoughtful and decent person.  His introspective examination of his life allows the author the chance to make some pithy observations, again crystalline in their quality, about the hardships of old age, especially as to how the elderly are viewed as less than human by many who still are young.  The subtext addresses the irony that those who are lucky enough to reach a respectable age are doomed to be old themselves.<br />The third story is the story of lost love, a long and touching examination of whether true love ever actually can be lost, and the impact of such loss on a person's subsequent life.<br />Hull zips among these three plotlines with the skill of a skateboard champion, carrying his readers along on a fast and thrilling ride.<br />This book deserves a Pulitzer Prize; it probably is the best work written on the first World War in the past half-century.	2001-03-27

After all these years--20? 30?--I'm still laughing!<br />As events would transpire, Mr. Della Femina and I ended up living in the same town.  Okay, so maybe I live here and he owns it.  My favorite reading in this town is the column that Jerry writes for the weekly newspaper...which he happens to own.  I usually make copies of this column and send it to friends.  Believe me, we all howl.<br />Considering his prominence in the place where we both live, there's not a month that passes that I don't tell somebody about this book.  It was as interesting as it was funny, a primer on the advertising industry written by a man of integrity.  (Did you hear the one about the time he got arrested for displaying pumpkins in front of the gourmet shop he owns?  Seriously, folks....)  Very simply, I think that Jerry Della Femina is a genius.  Of course, I give Jerry full credit for the title of this memoir, both the way he crafted the phrase and the sentiment behind it.<br />A dear friend was doing a very important business deal with a prominent Japanese firm.   He and his wife invited me to dinner to help entertain the company's rep on his trip to NYC. After they had invited me, they remembered my enthusiasm for this autobiography.  Then, they started to worry that I was going to tell the client (who spoke perfect English) all about Jerry's book.  They prevailed upon me to exercise restraint.  It was difficult, but I held my tongue.<br />There are some books which, as a reader, one just can't understand why a publisher would let go out of print.  As far as I'm concerned, WONDERFUL FOLKS heads my list.	2001-02-20

Even acknowledging that every reader must bring his or her own body of information to understanding a particular work, I found THE READER to be totally predictable.<br />This obviously autobiographical novel is set in the Germany immediately following World War II.  It concerns the fortuitous love affair between an adolescent boy and a mature woman.  <br />There's plenty of foreshadowing, so the reader instantly realizes that this woman harbors shameful secrets.  Considering the moment in time, it is easy to guess at what those secrets may be.<br />It is a telling comment on the attitudes of the Nazis that the secret that a modern person, of any non-German background, will find so horribly appalling is not the same fact which so shames the woman.  Instead, there is another secret which she would choose death over revealing.<br />I found nothing surprising in any aspect of the tale.  Since I read it in English, having been translated from the German, I am not able to say whether the quality of the writing of the original was superior.  The translation certainly was acceptable.	2001-02-14

Trite though it may be to say, Mrs. Krantz has led a life more amazing than most fiction.<br />Maybe it just has been luck, or maybe she really was born under a lucky star, but her life has been filled with magic.  She was born to two successful European Jewish immigrants to New York who gave her every advantage educationally and materially--except perhaps mother love.  Barbara Walters set her up with her husband, even provided the dress she would wear when they met.  (Admittedly, they had not yet grown up to be Great Dames; they still just were a couple of eager girls.)  Her brother married Shari Lewis.  She and her husband sold their co-op on Central Park West to David and Helen Gurley Brown.  By her own report, the entire ride's gone that way.<br />Immediately following World War II, right after Judy had graduated from college (Seven Sisters, it goes without saying), her father placed her for a year with an impoverished aristocrat in Paris.  At the time, Judy barely understood French.  By the end of the year, she spoke a perfect, fluent, Parisian-accented version, in which she can converse to this day.  Anybody who read SCRUPLES, her first blockbuster, will remember that this is a history that her heroine shared.  Oh, yes, and Judy also finally lost her virginity in the City of Love.<br />She writes bluntly about the sexual conventions of her generation, strange by contemporary standards.  In those pre-birth control days, she ended up needing an abortion.  And she had the abortion the day before she had her first date with her husband.  Yet the date must have gone well, since they are married over forty years, with children and grandchildren.<br />This is a woman who would have had a lovely and interesting life, even if she never had written a word.  The most serious problems she admits to having encountered were the polite anti-Semitism of post-war Paris and some overt anti-Semitism when she was on a book tour in Germany in the 1970's. <br />Professionally, Judith Krantz has specialized in writing the kind of popular novel which often is referred to by a more vulgar phrase than &quot;sex,&quot; always combined with shopping.  She certainly did not invent this genre, but she formalized it and designed the format which has had to have been followed by any author emulating SCRUPLES.<br />With sex and shopping to keep her busy along the way, Judith Krantz has led a fascinating life.	2001-02-10

In part because the novel always was a period piece, it doesn't show any age.<br />The heroine, Bess, could be a model for all women.  Yet she also proves (if one needs proof) how empowering money can be.  Because she is written as, indeed, &quot;a woman of independent means,&quot; she has an easier time making life choices than those who are not independent would have--and this was even more true in the era in which the story is set.<br />Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey's structure of letters is amazing.  To have told such a complicated story only in the form of correspondence is a feat rarely matched.  In fact, I think that Sandra Dallas's novel THE DIARY OF MATTIE SPENSER, in which an equally complicated story unfolds in diary entries, is the only challenger for this kind of technique.<br />Read this!

I haven't read anything yet from her that I haven't admired.  And I delighted in THE DIARY OF MATTIE SPENSER; couldn't put it down.<br />As always with a book by Ms. Dallas, she has researched thoroughly so that her readers can truly understand the time and the place in which she sets her story.<br />MATTIE opens with the pioneers on the wagon train to what was then the Colorado Territory.  Most of the story then unfolds on the prairie where this new bride and her husband settle.  This was a place so isolated and so bleak that we now know it drove many women, and a few men, to madness.  <br />Certainly, we understand these hardships as we sit in our warm homes, reading under the light of a good lamp.  But seeing the hardships spelled out, as Dallas does here, reminds us of the extent of the woes that these people endured, and the stoicism with which they accepted their realities.  Indian attacks, isolation, no plumbing, heat, light, medicine, plus childbirth fever...well, we now have a lot for which to be thankful.  And the distance that, as a population, we have moved in just a century is highlighted by this diary. <br />Part of Dallas' skill is that she always inhabits her characters so perfectly, giving them their voices.  Mattie, as Dallas writes her, is a woman of extraordinary virtues.  Decent, educated, kind and capable, she accepts her bridegroom's choices and defines the old-fashioned concept of &quot;helpmate.&quot;<br />Like all of Ms. Dallas' novels, this story pivots on a terrible secret, the worst secret she has written to date.  I must admit that I was upset with the outcome here, though I cannot see how the diary could have ended in any other way.  Still, Mattie's decision is thought-provoking in terms of today's women, and it highlights how far women have come in terms of both our rights and our freedoms within society.<br />I admired the concept of writing this story in the form of diary entries.Since Ms. Dallas apparently is a leading expert on Colorado frontier history, I cannot help wondering how much of MATTIE may be fact-based.<br />Truth or fiction, it doesn't matter.  THE DIARY OF MATTIE SPENSER is a wonderful book that will stay with its admirers for years after it first is read.	2001-02-05

Those of us who remember when Lady Diana Spencer got engaged to Prince Charles may recall news commentators mentioning her baby brother, a college student then nicknamed &quot;Champagne Charlie.&quot;  Well, Champagne Charlie has grown up and, with the death of his father, he has become Earl Spencer of Althrop.  Youthful pranks behind him, he now evidences his fine education and his excellent mind. <br />Admittedly, it must be easier to be fascinated by a family with a millennium-long and distinguished history when that family is your own.  Nor has it ever been disputed that the Spencers have been in England longer than the current royal family, the Windsors, by at least seven centuries.  So it turns out that the one link, the most compelling link for contemporary readers, to the much-loved Princess of Wales is only the most recent chapter in an important story.  At no moment in the last millennium was there ever an event in English history in which a Spencer did not play a major role, including Sir Winston Churchill, whose family name actually was &quot;Spencer Churchill.&quot;<br />In THE SPENCERS, without ever stating this explicitly, Charles Spencer makes it clear that the Windsors, with their Hanoverian/ Saxe-Coburg/ Battenberg family history, chose poor Diana precisely to provide Prince Charles' offspring, including any future kings he might sire, with a true English heritage. <br />That being said, anyone buying this book in the hopes of getting some inside information about the late Princess of Wales is going to be disappointed.  She is relegated to a single paragraph on the final page.  This is much to Earl Spencer's credit; it would be distasteful to see him try to exploit his sister's memory for simple profit.  And there are plenty of other books, tawdry books, which do just that.<br />If Charles Spencer's goal was to demonstrate that there is much more to Spencer family history than merely the obsession with his poor sister, he proves that he is entitledto this thesis.  By temperment, intellect and education, he seems to have been the perfect choice to have written this book.  And if he seems, at times, a bit proud...well, he's entitled.  The Spencers have a important background, a background about which Earl Spencer writes lyrically.  <br />THE SPENCERS will be valuable to students of history for its view of an entire millennium as seen through the prism of a single family's experience.	2001-02-02

LEADING WITH MY CHIN is his autobiography, and it certainly confirms his niceness.<br />This is the brief, &quot;official&quot; version of his childhood and early years, in which he gives what seems to be an honest appraisal of his failures every bit as much as his successes.  Many of the anecdotes, hardly unexpectedly for a person of Leno's skill, are hilarious.  A few are oddly touching.  Over and over, he proves himself to be caring and observant.<br />It would be impossible to read such an autobiography without learning something about the making of a star comedian, and about the hard work it requires.  Certainly, the determination to get as far as Leno and that handful of others have gotten must be fierce.  It says a great deal about Leno's humanity that he has managed to keep intact his decency while he climbed to the very top of his industry.	2001-01-29

All the nuances, the divisions, the subtle hostilities.  And she writes about these with an ease of style and a clarity of comprehension.<br />The biggest flaw with this mystery definitely is not Ms. Feldman's fault.  The publisher chose to reveal too much detail on the jacket blurb, pretty much giving away the secrets to be uncovered.  This is a shame, and unfair to an author as skilled as Ellen Feldman.<br />Still, even though the mystery is predictable, so were the works of Charles Dickens.  And that doesn't make them any less worthy.  GOD BLESS THE CHILD is a touching story, and in the process of telling it, Ms. Feldman makes some pithy observations.<br />The ending was a small one, since too many of the pertinent points were disclosed so early on.  Yet that's okay; life doesn't come with neat demarcations, either.  The best any of us can hope for is a sense of peace regarding how we live our lives, and at peace is where Feldman leaves her heroine.<br />This is compelling reading, more for the underlying concepts and the lovely prose than for any excitement in the mysteries to be resolved.  From the writing, to the plotting, to the thoughtful examination of relationships, all of it is worthwhile.  And what makes GOD BLESS THE CHILD work is that it is so true to life.	2001-01-29

That's what happened to me with THE LION'S GAME: author Nelson DeMille made his story so exciting that I would find myself holding my breath.<br />DeMille long has been one of my favorite authors.  When he wrote PLUM ISLAND, the predecessor of THE LION'S GAME, I had thought that he never would exceed that accomplishment.  And along comes THE LION'S GAME--and DeMille exceeded PLUM ISLAND.  Incredible!<br />DeMille always has been an author of great imagination and gifted story-telling skills.  What sets him ahead of the pack is his impeccable research and attention to details.  The details he is careful to provide not only make his plots plausible; the details also make his mysteries fascinating.<br />THE LION'S GAME may remain the best suspense thriller I ever read...unless DeMille writes its sequel and again outdoes himself.	2001-01-27

To think that one man wrote MARJORIE MORNINGSTAR, THE CAINE MUTINY, THIS IS MY GOD, THE WINDS OF WAR, WAR &amp; REMEMBRANCE, DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL plus a half dozen others simply boggles the imagination.<br />Along with DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL, Wouk's funniest book, INSIDE, OUTSIDE is an easier read than most of the other topics he has tackled.  Set in a recent decade, the title refers to the fact that in Jewish families, some people use one name at home, their Hebrew, &quot;inside&quot; name and the Anglicized version of that same name out in the big world.  Along with the name chosen go two different and distinctive aspects of their personalities.<br />It seemed clear on reading INSIDE, OUTSIDE that the hero's sister, Lee, is the all-grown up version of Marjorie Morningstar.  This is not Herman Wouk's most important book, far from it, but it is one of his easiest works to read.  The story he has told, as always, is an interesting one.  There is no such thing as a bad book when Mr. Wouk is the author.	2001-01-25

His books are gripping tales which stay with a reader long after the stories have come to an end.  One reason for this is DeMille's impeccable research--though his plots are fictional, the premises always are fact-based.<br />In PLUM ISLAND, DeMille sets the mystery on the very real, very dangerous, government germ repository located in the Long Island Sound--within ten miles proximity of millions of people.  That's real, and that single detail takes this thriller out of the ordinary.  In the process of solving the crimes, DeMille offers plenty of details about Plum Island (most of them terrifying in their implications)and a fair amount of true Long Island history, dating back to colonial times, when the region was part of the second town of the Plymouth Colony.<br />Combined with DeMille's facile writing style, the trail of murders he has concocted blended with actual fact makes for one of the two best thrillers on the market.  The only contender for that title is the sequel to PLUM ISLAND.	2001-01-25

The story demonstrates the inevitability of death for every living thing, in the process proving the theory that it is the ride, and not the destination, that matters.  My uncle had lived well, so the novel's theme brought me great comfort.  And this work's underlying subtext is that love, in all its forms, is the greatest power.  I treasured this book, these characters, the town in which it was set.  The values that the characters held were nothing more than simple morality, but these were the very values that made America so great.  Reading AND LADIES OF THE CLUB helped me to come to terms with all of these realities.  It is a very powerful novel.	2001-01-24

That niceness keeps shining through the details, regardless of how, yes... wild those details sound.  I'M WILD AGAIN is written in the same breezy style she made famous while putting the ailing COSMOPOLITAN magazine back on to the top of the heap, re-defining the magazine publishing industry in the process.

Yet Vincent Lardo perfectly has caught the flavor of the beloved character of Archy McNally, which originally was created by the late Lawrence Sanders.  He's caught the rhythm of the narrative, the sense of place, the voice of the protagonist.  So if you loved Sanders' Archy, you won't notice much difference in Lardo's version.  And if you like to read a good mystery about the high life, Palm Beach, tropical nights, gourmet foods, and, oh yes, romance, then any of the McNally books should hit the spot.  Doesn't matter whether the author was Lawrence or Vince.  These are fun reads, the published equivalents of sneaking potato chips.  You won't want to stop with just one.	2001-01-23

There were others ahead of her, Margaret Mitchell, Taylor Caldwell, Mary McCarthy and Grace Metalious all come to mind.  Yet it was Susann who took the s-e-x out of the implied and on to the explicit, redefining the path of fiction forever. <br />The authors of too many biographies, in their quest for thoroughness and scholarship, take lively subjects and make them dull.  Seaman has avoided that trap here, instead writing a biography that reads much like a novel itself.<br />Seaman portrays Susann as she was, uneducated, possessing no special talent, cursed by misfortunes, of which she had more than her share.  Susann failed as an actress, she failed as a talk show host.  Yet Susann also was driven and undeterred in her determination to find success, and find success she did.  In the process, she not only re-defined the way in which contemporary fiction was written--she also re-designed the way in which books themselves were marketed.  And Seaman has provided all of the details in LOVELY ME.  To Seaman's credit, this biography never loses its pace; she keeps the story interesting right to its inevitable end.<br />Knowing the right people, being seen in the right places, was the essence of Susann's determination, and Jackie saw to these with great precision.  Eventually, the fictionalized version of her life would become the basis of her bestsellers.<br />Therefore, in the process of telling Susann's life story, Seaman also offers a snapshot of life in New York City from the 1930's to the 1970's.  The result is a history of a fascinating woman at a fascinating time.  LOVELY ME is a lovely read.	2001-01-23

So it is no surprise that, since he wrote a dog book, it is the ultimate dog book ever.<br />Simply stated, MY DOG SKIP is his memoir of his love affair with his dog.  Like so many little boys, especially only children, his relationship with his dog was one of the purest, strongest loves that any person can know.  <br />In describing their great love, Morris inescapably also must describe his childhood in a small town of the American south, circa 1930.  As a direct result of the lyricism of Morris' prose, this book then becomes a perfect snapshot of the slow, honest, rhythms of life in towns like his.<br />The book ends as all these stories do.  A tribute, once again, to Willie's skill is that the inevitable does not become maudlin.<br />The movie which was made from this story was extremely well-received.  I had read that Mr. Morris had visited the set very shortly before his unexpected death, and that he had proclaimed himself pleased with the film.  I am so glad that this gave him pleasure, because he has given so much pleasure to so many readers over the decades.	2001-01-23

The focus is the group of people and the very region which created the American nation as the greatest country in the history of the world.  The rhythms of life vastly were different a hundred or so years ago, the dreams were more simple, the morality clearer-cut.  Anyone reading SEVENTEEN needs to understand that this book is about a time and place now so far away and different from what we have come to know that it could be science fiction.  Yet people remain the same, emotions remain the same.  As a result, SEVENTEEN holds its value as the prototypical coming-of-age novel.  Booth Tarkington was one of the premiere authors of his era and that is the reason why, decades later, SEVENTEEN remains worth reading.  It is the definition of a classic.	2001-01-23

Our heroine is the daughter of a Boston Brahmin family whose fortune derives from the shipping industry of the early 19th century.  Author Susan Wiggs exhibits far better than typical romance novelist-style knowledge of her subject, and she creates a strong sense of place in her descriptions of Boston.  The sex scenes, though requisite for the genre, seem a bit gratuitous in the context of the well-researched historic framework and the excellent writing.  Louisa May Alcott wrote about this same population and she was wildly successful without including heaving bosoms, milky-white loins and other euphemisms; on the other hand, Alcott didn't have a modern editor urging her to turn up the heat.  THE CHARM SCHOOL is a pleasing and interesting work of fiction.	2001-01-20

WISHES, however, has a mystical element which would be no more than hokey in the hands of a lesser author.  Yet in Ms. Delinsky's capable fashion, the metaphysical transcends the woo-woo and, ultimately, this story becomes extremely moving.  Along the way, she has created a subtext which explores the non-tangible gifts offered by life; her conclusion is that love is all-important.  Delinsky has a marvelous imagination and excellent story-telling skills, which is why this book works.	2001-01-20

It is a work that approaches genius.  What an imagination Anita Diamant boasts!  It is difficult to understand how she even came up with the concept.  As her notes at the end of the work indicate, her research and her scholarship are of the highest order.  <br />This would be a particularly difficult opus for any author, to take a first-person narrative, told in hindsight and with a minimum of dialogue, and set it approximately 5700 years in the past.  Yet Diamant's characters seem as fresh and real as one's next-door neighbor.  Again, what an imagination!<br />Her &quot;heroine,&quot; Dinah, was the only daughter of the biblical Jacob to have survived to adulthood.  Jacob was the son of Issac, grandson of Abraham, brother of Esau, father of the Joseph of &quot;The Coat of Many Colors.&quot;  Women, it is obvious, were an afterthought to the information handed down about these patriarchs and prophets.  Yet THE RED TENT is Dinah's story, the story of a person who was a footnote to history, just as Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern were footnotes to HAMLET.  In both cases, authors with fertile imaginations have plumbed the lives of these minor characters for their significance. <br />In Dinah's case, Ms. Diamant reveals the truth about the story of Jacob. In Sunday school, we are taught about his being tricked into marriage with one sister, Leah, when it was the younger girl, Rachel, whom he had loved.  So this book solved a mystery I had wondered about all these years, what had happened to Leah when Jacob finally married Rachel.  In THE RED TENT, I finally learned that Jacob, in keeping with the custom of the times, had two wives plus two concubines.  No, my teachers never mentioned that detail. <br />Life then was very hard, another fact which is glossed over in Biblical study, but which should seem obvious when contemplated.  Ms. Diamant exhibits just how difficult it was, in every way, by modern standards.  There was no notion of sanitation, no medications, women frequently died in childbirth, dental care was six millennia in the future, etc.  Even if a reader understood all of this before reading THE RED TENT, Ms. Diamant demonstrates these realities with heart-stopping detail.<br />These people were so primitive that, properly, they were not Israelites; perhaps they should be known as Canaanites or Semites.  Still, from them flowed monotheism, leading directly to the Jewish religion which, in turn, gave rise to both Christianity, in all its permutations, as well as Islam.  Yet the reader of THE RED TENT will find it unavoidable to examine the entire meaning of religion once it is set into it this framework of the concepts which fostered it.<br />Ms. Diamant deserves the highest commendations for THE RED TENT, on every basis: concept, execution and prose.  This book is the highest category of fiction.	2001-01-20

The good news is that her writing skills are excellent and that she paces the story beautifully, so that the reader gallops along with her premise.  The details she provides are thorough and fascinating.  <br />I have spent considerable time in L.A., where this novel is set, and I never had heard of most of the restaurants she writes about; they may be known to a resident such as Ms. Adler, but they are not in the guide books.  So, on my next trip back to L.A., I do hope to try a few of the places she takes her characters.<br />The problem, of course, is that this is a mystery, and not a tourist guide.  Though the read was fast and easy, after the ending is reached, it is inescapable that even as fiction, the plot is too filled with holes.  <br />The heroine is a gorgeous, sexy, young, magnificently dressed, sexy (that's right, that's twice)... law professor?  Oh, please.  There aren't too many law professors who are only 32 years old, and those that are that young rarely are sexy.  This small group of wonderkids have been much too fixated on their careers to have been worrying about their hair.  Even assuming &quot;arguendo,&quot; as the legal eagles say, that she is 32, gorgeous, sexy and magnificently dressed, I doubt that a Pepperdine University professor would fly to San Francisco to give a guest lecture at Berkeley, or meet with the L.A. district attorney to discuss the abilities of one of her students that the D.A. is considering hiring, or give a pop quiz to her class.  A pop quiz?  For law students, that's a new one.  And when would this lusty little creature find the time to grade it?  Between orgasms?  None of this makes any sense.<br />Yet all of these objections don't even get to the underlying premise of the psychopathic homicidal maniac.  Fiction should move readers along, not make them stop and snicker.  Ms. Adler displays too much skill as an author to pander to the market for sex-and-violenceas she does in ALL OR NOTHING.	2001-01-20

Since all of this happened a long time ago, in the dark ages before child abuse was frowned upon, it is a credit to author Rich's writing skills that he made his report so real that it could elicit such a reaction forty years after the events described.  Of course, all of us who are New Yorkers, all of us who have spent the last twenty or so years reading Mr. Rich in the NEW YORK TIMES, hardly can be surprised by his exquisite prose.<br />Still, this book was fascinating in revealing the evolution of genius, a child who took refuge from the trauma of a broken home (both physically and emotionally) in an obsession with the legitimate theatre.  The childish obsession ended with Rich's becoming the chief drama critic of the TIMES for the better part of two decades.  Tolstoy is credited with saying that happy families are all alike, but each unhappy family is different.  GHOST LIGHT proves that theory; it is a story unlike any other.  Lovers of both theatre and fine writing will be well-served by this memoir.	2001-01-18

Ultimately, however, the prose is incidental--it's the information that Rhodes provides that is so devastating.  By the time the text is completed, one seriously may consider whether to eat meat again; indeed, some readers even may wonder whether it is safe to wear leather shoes.

Yet Ms. Goodwin herself has said in interviews that of all the books she has written, WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR seems to strike the strongest emotional chord among her readers.  <br />This book is writing at its best and, therefore, it's good reading.  It will be of special interest to anyone with a passion for baseball, particularly the Dodgers, especially before the team left Brooklyn.  <br />Yet this memoir is more than just a baseball story, though that part is fascinating.  It offers a good picture of the energy found in the States during those years immediately following World War II, and an excellent history of the expansion of New York City and the immediately adjacent suburbs at that same moment in time.<br />My father and his brothers, like all little boys born in Brooklyn in the first decades of the 20th Century, were avid Dodgers fans.  By 1986, three of the four brothers had died.  My bachelor uncle remained alone, 85 years old, though I phoned him every day and visited him frequently.  During the '86 World Series, I was trying to engage his attention; his mind was clear, but his enthusiasms had abated.  <br />So I tried to instigate a conversation.  &quot;What do you think of the Mets?  Can you believe that they won the Series?&quot;  <br />He responded, &quot;I have to tell you, sweetheart, that after the Dodgers left Brooklyn, we never again cared that much about baseball.&quot;  I understood that when he said &quot;we,&quot; it wasn't meant in the royal sense--he was referring to three brothers who had predeceased him.<br />My uncle died in 1994, at the age of 93.  He remained a voracious reader until the day he died.  The highest compliment I can pay Ms. Goodwin is that I am sorry that he did not live long enough to read WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR.  It's a wonderful book, and he would have reveled in it.	2001-01-14

Her heroine is an engaging one and the characters of the supporting cast are better developed than in the typical woman's fiction.<br />If there's one significant difference here from other women's fiction, it was the failure to display exactly why this particular heroine was so lovable that men practically dropped at her feet.  Yet that answer really has no impact on the more important issues addressed in the book.<br />NO KIDDING is a fascinating story, and the only flaw was grammatical.  She has persistent problems with the past tense and with the proper use of subject or object in a sentence.  (Who, whom, I, me.)  I hope that Ms. Tokunaga writes many more novels, and I hope that she finds a capable editor before her next work is published; her storytelling skills deserve better.<br />NO KIDDING addresses some very important issues which almost always are otherwise ignored, and it does so in a lively style which draws in the reader.	2001-01-09

Maybe the garbage once was fresh and new, but after the umpteenth airing, there's nothing to recommend it.  Still, these writers have become brand names, so their publishers give each of their new books the big send-off with the requisite advertising budget and a publicity tour.  And faithful readers buy these books without hesitation.<br />Then, one stumbles upon a gem, a little perfect gem.  THE HOUSE ON OLIVE STREET is just such a gem.  Its author deserves the book tour, the big ad budget.  Instead, this book simply will have to make its own way on the paperback racks.  That's fair neither to Robyn Carr, who wrote HOUSE, nor to the legion of women who look forward to reading good fiction and who should be assisted in finding her novel more easily.<br />This novel has all the elements: A half-dozen complex characters, real and well-drawn, multiple plots, lively prose.  The underlying subtext is about values and about love.  None of the storylines descend to cliche.  Unlike many similar novels, the ending is not entirely predictable, either, much to Ms.  Carr's credit.  <br />The thread that weaves HOUSE together is a writers' group, with some of the members single, some married, some childless, some with large broods, each of whom writes a different kind of book and all of whom support and nurture the others through every kind of crisis. <br />THE HOUSE ON OLIVE STREET deserves a big success.  Read it, you'll like it.	2001-01-06
US	53014052	R19FVZWY6HEPM0	0553284657	355864039	Scruples	Books	5	8	11	N	N	The Book That Created The Genre	Judith Krantz was not the first great writer of women's fiction: Mary McCarthy, Taylor Caldwell, Grace Metallus and Jacqueline Susann came before her.  Yet, certainly, Krantz gave birth to the women's fiction industry as it exists today.  Susan Issacs, Olivia Goldsmith, Danielle Steel, Jackie Collins, Barbara Taylor Bradford and Mary Higgins Clark are just some of those who follow the path blazed by Judith Krantz.  A few of these Great Dames may have equalled Ms. Krantz, but none of them has yet exceeded her success.<br />SCRUPLES is the first modern novel written in that lively style which so many others have tried to emulate.  As always with Ms. Krantz, SCRUPLES has several complicated, entwined plotlines involving the half-dozen or so leading characters.  As always with Ms. Krantz, these characters each are complex, convincing and endearing. Her writing here, as it would prove to be ever after, is easy to read and quick-paced. <br />Where Judith Krantz stands alone among the ladies is in the details.  After a reader has finished one of her books, that reader will have had an education in whatever topics the book covers.  In SCRUPLES, the reader will learn all about high-end retailing and fashion design, about growing up in Paris, about the lifestyle of the rich and famous in Beverly Hills.  In fact, Judith Krantz probably solidified the entire fascination with that kind of lifestyle, spawning television series, magazines and, yes, other novels.  In reading Ms. Krantz's work, one admires the gowns, tastes the treats, smells the perfume, touches the sculptures.  No other author consistently claims this same effect.<br />Many years after its first issue, SCRUPLES remains as fresh as the day it was published.  Not many works can boast of this achievement, and those that do are known as &quot;classics.&quot;  This freshness, too, must be unique among the women's books.  The similar efforts of other authors quickly become dated if they are not read within the first couple of years after they hit the shops.  <br />Judith Krantz deserves greater appreciation than she has received from her legion of fans.  An entire branch of the publishing industry has evolved out of second-rate authors who attempt to imitate her style with little success, yet acknowledgement of Krantz's impact has been inexcusably slow in coming.  <br />Judith Krantz clearly set out to write a big, glitzy novel, a fun read.  And she did.  Did she ever!  Very simply, Judith Krantz is the best of the best.	2001-01-05

Yet once the reader accepts the basic premise of her time-travel fantasy, Miller keeps her story fast-moving and consistent within the premise of that fantasy.

Jayne Ann Krentz barely bothered to flesh out her characterizations or her (single) plot line.  Worst of all, ECLIPSE BAY was dull.  For one of the bestselling authors in the world, Krentz could have, should have, done better.  Yet as long as her name on the cover sells millions of copies, it would seem that neither she nor her publisher care if they cheat her public.  And the public that keeps buying her novels must not care too much, either.  I'll think hard before I plunk down money for her next book.	2001-01-03

What an imagination the woman has!  Fascinating stuff, fantasy with a fair amount of historic detail.  I liked PIRATES slightly more than KNIGHTS, probably only because it was a somewhat less complex story, and within the complicated fantasy framework the reader needs to accept, it seemed to flow more easily.  Still, I think that both of these novels are masterpieces within their genre, and I recommend them both heartily.  Can this woman write!	2001-01-03

This is a beautiful book, beautifully conceived, beautifully written in typical Delinsky fashion. The characters are well-fleshed and the story is gripping and fast-paced.  The book, ultimately, is touching as well.  For fans of Ms. Delinsky, COAST ROAD is a must-read.

This is not Rosamunde Pilcher's best novel, but Pilcher at less than her best still is better than 99% of most other writers.  All of Mrs. Pilcher's loyal fans will greet WINTER SOLSTICE like a long lost friend, combining as the book does all of those elements that Rosamunde Pilcher presents so beautifully.  There are the endearing characters, the lyrical descriptions of the countryside, the piercing insights.  SOLSTICE is, unfortunately, a bit linear on plot, a bit predictable and a bit uncomplicated, but Mrs. Pilcher's writing nonetheless elevates this novel to something special.  The largest hole in the story is the fact that when a devastating tragedy strikes one of the characters in the autumn, that character largely recovers and builds an entire new life by Christmas.  Tragedy is a classic technique to motivate a story, and Mrs. Pilcher has used such tragedy more successfully in the past.  Yet the speed with which the character here regroups simply isn't believable.  Still, I will take Mrs. Pilcher at a mediocre level any day over hundreds of other authors at their personal bests.	2001-01-02

I grabbed this book off the proverbial drugstore shelf before getting on a train, and I found it pleasant and entertaining.  With most genre romances, there has to be a total suspension of reality to get to the plot.  I found this plot more plausible.  Though the ancillary characters are caricatures, the stereotypes they represent are very real, and author Nichols did a fine job in creating them.  In fact, though this story is linear in its track to a happy ending--but, then, aren't they all?--the motivating premise is far more original and well-conceived than the typical romance.  For anyone who may be seeking a sweet and easy read, HANDYMAN is a fine choice.	2000-12-29

This is a fascinating concept, and a marketable one as well, in light of America's current infatuation with the Edifice Complex.  Considering the author's scholarly credentials, SEX AND REAL ESTATE should have been a absorbing book.  &quot;Should have&quot; is the pivotal phrase here.  No question that Garber's body of knowledge is vast--she hops all over the map with only the most tenuous connection to her thesis.  Maybe she merely was showing off how much smarter she is than the average reader.  While I have no doubt but that this fact is true, the book still quickly descends into boring psychobabble.  Anyone seeking enlightenment is bound to be disappointed.	2000-12-29

Yet even among Susan's books, there are subtle divisions and there is no question that within her hierarchy, IT HAD TO BE YOU is up there at the top of the heap.

US	53014052	R23ZZA11O90YFB	0609605925	781244785	Angel Falls	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Not her finest effort	Coincidentally, I read ANGEL FALLS consecutively with Barbara Delinsky's COAST ROAD, so maybe it wasn't a fair contrast, but both novels deal with virtually identical themes, a wife/mother who lies unconscious in a hospital.  How the women get to the hospital differ, yet that's just a detail; the exploration of the impact of the enormity of their illnesses on their families, and the uncertainty as to whether each woman will survive, are absolutely the same.  Delinsky's characters were far more believable and sympathetic--even, in the case of COAST ROAD, the self-absorbed ex-husband.  Her characters evolved in response to their crisis.  Again in contrast, the most intriguing plot point in ANGEL FALLS, the hidden first marriage of the heroine, could have, should have, been explored with far more information and interest.  Fans of Kristin Hannah may be disappointed in this eagerly awaited novel.	2000-12-29

This is not a genre romance, though it deals with passion, betrothal and marriage but, rather, it is a story featuring a complicated woman with complicated issues.  As such, REDEEMING EVE is a reassuring shift from classic woman's fiction, requiring some attention on the part of the reader.  The devise that holds the story together is the background of the heroine's work on her doctoral thesis about Jane Austen.  The details about the scholarly process should be interesting to anyone outside of academia.  I found Bokat's novel absorbing and well-paced; I admired the fact that she didn't take the facile way and make her heroine easy to like.  Bokat's writing style is embracing and her story is compelling.  This is post-feminist fiction at its best.	2000-12-29

The story is told from the point of view of four women who refer to themselves as THE SAVING GRACES.  The gang came together back in the days when women needed official &quot;groups&quot; to explore issues of self-discovery and validation.  Unlike most similar women's groups, The Graces still are having regular meetings after all these years.  With the passage of time, true friendships have developed, and this novel hinges on the emotional growth of the characters, and on exploring support and assistance they give to one another.  Ultimately, THE SAVING GRACES is about love.  A credit of Ms. Gaffney is that not only do her characters seem real, but they start to feel like friends.  I was sorry when the book had to end.	2000-12-29

There is no sweeter heroine than Gracie, smart and tough while simultaneously kind and innocent.  Bobby Tom is that bad boy that all good girls want, cuter than Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise or Bob Redford (pick your generation), spoiled but with a heart that just is waiting to be rescued by the love of the right woman.  And, let us be blunt, nobody writes a love scene like Susan Elizabeth Phillips does, though many others have tried.  I like everything that she's authored, but I think I like this novel most of all.  HEAVEN, TEXAS really flies while one reads it, and stays with the reader long after it ends.	2000-12-29

As a result, his book about what really, truly, takes place behind the swinging doors of professional kitchens is a revelation.  Some of what goes on may be as bad as the average customer suspects, and some of it may be even worse.  Yet Bourdain's love of food colors every chapter, and it is that love that empowered him to become a success.  His writing is fast-paced and he manages to make the hundrum of everyday restaurant management, the purveying, the staffing, the firings, all seem fascinating.  It is not surprising that in his spare time, Bourdain authors mystery novels.  He also is proof that to be a great chef, often, it is counterproductive to be nice.

Oddly, it reminded me in structure of Fitzgerald's TENDER IS THE NIGHT, opening as it does with an American visiting France, an American whom the reader assumes will have great impact on the story to come.  Both these books also feature young women of other-worldy beauty and doctors at the cutting edges of their professions.  Yet in both these books, the visiting American is no more than an ancillary character, and the style of the stories diverge from there.<br />     THE ROSE GROWER begins in a small town in the French countryside on the day that the Bastille has been stormed in Paris.  Of course, with the poor communications of that era, the country folk are unaware of the import of the tearing down of the prison.  The book continues through the worst years of the French Revolution, the &quot;Terror&quot; as it popularly was known.  The revolutionaries evolve into creatures who rival Hitler and Stalin in their cruelties, though the simpler citizens of the countryside are unaware to this prospective impact in the first flush of anti-Royalist excitement.<br />     Ms. de Kretser is a lyrical author, as gifted as any of the other modern greats.  Each word she chooses is a gem.  She writes with a feeling of stillness, of import, of foreboding.  She doesn't waste a single sentence.  Her heroine, indeed, does grow roses, in order to earn a bit of extra money to assist her long-impoverished aristocratic family.  When Ms. de Kretser describes the flowers, her prose is sensual; one even could say sexual.  Yet always, in the background, the tumbrels roll.  This book deserves to be read by anyone with an appreciation of the art of the novel.	2000-12-26

The premise is compelling right to the end, and if there are any holes in the plot, those holes are not apparent; in fact, the story is deeply engrossing.  Like too many romances, the ancillary heroines are not given enough attention--I assume that this is an official publishing industry policy so as not to tax the readers' attention, and to save paper at the same time.  But Linda Howard is a master of her genre, and if you're going to read just one romance novel this year, MR. PERFECT is a...perfect choice.  One warning, however: don't buy this as a gift for a teenage goddaughter or and 80-year old grandmother.  The language is explicit, though not disgusting, and there's lots (and lots!) of racy sex.	2000-12-20

This time, she's in a mining town in Montana during the Depression, dealing with three poor girls, best friends who like to call themselves the &quot;Unholy Three.&quot;  Dallas seems authoritative about life in Montana from the 30's to the present, and her dialect certainly sounds authentic.  Her character development, as always, is excellent; she certainly captures the heroines' voices.  One little girl grows up to become a bombshell movie star.  The others remain in Montana, poor but never envious of the member of the trio who found fame and fortune in Hollywood.  Of course, there are men, and a secret, and some tragedies.

Emily Kimbrough is the co-author, with Cornelia Otis Skinner, of the classic, OUR HEARTS WERE YOUNG AND GAY.  On her own, she was a prolific author, and I wish that her publishers would re-issue more of her books.  HOW DEAR TO MY HEART is a 1991 re-issue, underwritten by the Delaware County Historic Society, of her reminiscence of her earliest childhood in Muncie, Indiana at the turn of the 20th century.  The original printing was in 1944.<br />     As always, Ms. Kimbrough's writing is lyrical, and one easily can imagine through her those defining years for our nation, a moment when electricity and automobiles first were entering everyday life, and the telephone still was in the experimental stages.  Ms. Kimbrough's vivid style makes that moment understandable, and she remembers her childhood, the places and the people, with great affection.<br />     Like all children, she assumed that her realities were the only ones, but the truth is that she grew up in one of the most prominent and affluent families in a small town and, as such, her upbringing was that of an American princess.  Still, her family's excellent values shine through, as they do in all her books, and she demonstrates a slice of life that never again will be recaptured.  Christmas in Muncie in 1905 is somewhere between Dickens and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, and it makes for marvelous reading.<br />     Consistent with all of her other books, there are plenty of funny anecdotes interspersed with studies of the characters in her life, her paternal grandfather and maternal grandmother (and that grandmother's next-door neighbor, President Benjamin Harrison) and her nanny, the daughter of former slaves. <br />     The charming drawings add to the overall feeling of the book.  I believe that the same artist also did the illustrations for the early Betsy-Tacy books by Maud Hart Lovelace; essentially, these stories are about similar little girls in similar towns.  Maud's girls are fictionalized and Emily's storyis her own, but the spirit of both their styles are much the same.<br />      This is a wonderful book.	2000-12-19

Of course, by now, it's more like visiting with old friends than it is starting out on a brand-new adventure.  Yet with the passage of years, the simpler delights--and values--which OUR HEARTS WERE YOUNG AND GAY displays so matter-of-factly appear even more touching than they once had.  There are many scenes which are hilarious, and I can state definitively that these scenes have withstood the test of time.  While OUR HEARTS WERE YOUNG AND GAY undeniably is a sweet story, it remains the best read ever.  And it is a book that anyone can share with a teenaged daughter or an 80-year old grandmother without a second's concern about exposing them to ideas that may be unseemly.	2000-12-19

The command of her scholarship is evident in the everyday details she provides about life in 18th century Massachusetts, yet her character development is modern, which is a major reason that the story is so riveting.  This is a complicated murder mystery with none of the modern conveniences available in either weapons or forensics.

The &quot;Persian Pickle&quot; is Kansas jargon for the paisley pattern; a piece of paisley fabric is cherished there by a group of women who regularly get together to make quilts, just as their mothers had done before them and they expect their own daughters to do in turn.       This is a short book dense with emotion and import.  The characterizations are excellent and the writing is lyrical.  The Pickle ladies do more than quilt, of course, they comfort and support one another through all of life's vageries.  Since the story is set during the Depression, there are plenty of tough times for them to rise above and, in fact, they accept those hardships with grace.  When the bride of a local farmer's son joins them, their insularity and unthinking acceptance of their community's rhythms gets held up for examination through her far more worldly eyes.      The picture painted by Sandra Dallas is a detailed one of life on the prairie at the beginning of modern times.  The women are real enough to feel like a reader's friends, and the book--and the relationship--ends much too quickly.  But the story has been told, the secret the ladies shared revealed.  In the greatest tribute to any author, the tale lingers on in the mind of her reader.  And in the process, Dallas' readers even learn quite a bit about the fine art of quilting!	2000-12-16

The story opens with three women rushing to a hospital ER, each of them having been contacted that her husband has been in an auto accident.  Only after they have gathered at his bedside, all of them wondering who the other two are, do they discover that the beloved spouse has three wives.  Unfortunately, he never had bothered to divorce the first two, making him a trigamist.        Not only is the premise clever, but the author is able to sustain the pace right to the end.  There is some romance here, but only a bit, and calling this a romance novel is inappropriate.  The story has more of a feminist feel, with these women dealing with how they've been wronged.  And the book is funny, actually very funny.  There are points when the dialogue is hilarious.  Ms. Bond is a writer of genuine talent, and I eagerly await her next book.	2000-12-13

Sure, it's a light froth of a story, but it's inherently more clever than most similar romances.  Not plodding and not so linear, even if the ending--like all romances--is the predictable one.  Yet in this story, getting there is a whole lot of fun.  I can't remember when I laughed aloud as much reading a story of this genre.  Author Rhonda Thompson gets in her pokes, spoofing the fact that in a romance novel, the hero must be handsome with washboard abs--then giving her hero dazzling looks and washboard abs.  A similar description applies to her heroine, just as Thompson mocks the prototypical heroine's requisite beauty.  Only one part of the premise seems a bit strained, that the hero is a book reviewer for a local paper who has a huge following and enormous influence, a situation that never occurs in real life--sorry, book reviewers just are not household names.  Still, most of these romances require some suspension of credulity.  At least this novel is reality-based, and once a reader accepts the hero's popularity as a motivating force in the story, it's a whole lot of fun to read the tale Ms. Thompson has woven.  If she can sustain this pace, she is going to have an important romance writing career.	2000-12-13

This is a complicated story, a love story with three heroines and four potential lovers.  Though the story is complex, it is handled admirably, and at no point does it strain a reader's credulity.  There is the primary heroine, an accomplished modern woman, a secondary heroine who is a complicated teenager, and a flashback heroine.  The flashback sections take place during World War II and are set in the French Resistance; these sections are printed in italics.  The characterizations are plausible and the threads of the story are fascinating, woven together into a appealing tapestry.  There is mystery, there is terror, there is sex.  Ms. Brockmann is a masterful writer and poised to move to the head of her genre.  This book holds the attention to the very last page.	2000-12-13

After all, the premise is compelling.  The book turned out to be a complete disappointment.  While it is obvious that the author can, indeed, write, she did not make much effort with this novel.  The characters all were dislikable, to be kind, except for the heroine's poor fiance, who just was a jerk.  The story was full of holes.  How did the heroine's sister realize that her sibling's long-lost mystery love was a man whom she just had met if they didn't know his last name?  The best thing that can be said about the whole book is that it was short.  In a better work, I might have felt cheated by the length but, here, it was an assist.  I couldn't read anymore of it.	2000-12-06

You're No One in Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	Unexpectedly Touching	I found myself unexpectedly touched by this autobiography.  Having read it, I consider Bernie Brillstein a friend.  With no self-praise, Brillstein shows himself to be a man of decency, of compassion, of empathy.  He began in his profession as an agent at William Morris, dreaming of representing mid-Century comics such as Jackie Gleason and Jackie Gale.  When he left William Morris, he became a personal manager, starting the careers of dozens of entertainers who have become household names.  The stories Bernie has to tell!  He survived--there's no other word--until the end of the century, representing Jim Henson, Lorne Michaels, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd and, as the saying goes, a cast of thousands along the way.  He created HEE HAW and greenlighted THE SOPRANOS, headed a movie studio for a short time, got fired, picked himself up and started again.  His very life has been the personification of the entertainment business; there are few who exceeded his success.  And he is the one having the last laugh: He's still here!  But along with the chronological report of his professional experience, what he was thinking, how he pulled it off, there is this man, this basically sweet and decent man, and that's what shines through his book.  I enjoyed reading about Bernie's fascinating life.	2000-12-03

So, too, with Edward Tanner, better known as Patrick Dennis, at least according to Eric Myers.  Myers has written the long-overdue biography of Tanner, who is best remembered for having written AUNTIE MAME.  This is a peculiar work: While Myers' research and writing both are first-class, his subject unexpectedly turns out to have been a sad little man.  As interesting as Tanner's life undeniably was, there can be no mistaking that he turned his back on his family in the pursuit of his own fulfillment.  Tanner's late wife sounds saintly, accepting as she was of his bi-sexuality.  Inevitably, this book could not help becoming a treatise on mid-Century homosexuality and how closeted it then was.  In the end, Myers' scholarship could not transcend the sadness of his subject matter.  &quot;Pat&quot; Tanner is a man who should have had it all--yet he managed to blow most of it.  Still, this was a story worth telling and Myers told it well.	2000-12-03

A HAMPTONS CHRISTMAS, his latest book in what so far has been a series of four adventures reported by narrator Beecher Stowe, was a relief after the prior work, THE HOUSE THAT ATE THE HAMPTONS.  A HAMPTONS CHRISTMAS confirms that Mr. Brady is an American treasure.  In fact, this book screams &quot;movie script,&quot; dropping every name that counts in East Hampton, the peculiar little town in which it is set.  The story hinges on the most endearing underage heroine since Eloise at The Plaza, to whom she actually bears similarities in her worldliness and occasional cynicism.    Along with this heart-stealing character are the regulars in the series, starting with the narrator, his paramour, Lady Alix, his father, the old OSS man, the Chief of the local Indian tribe, the requisite housekeeper, the head bayman....Well, that's the picture.      Oddly enough, these characters will ring true to anybody who knows East Hampton.  This is a town filled with contrasts, summer people and year-round, rich and poor, all of whom bump up against one another with a surprising degree of respect.  Mr. Brady writes about the community with the perception that only an insider could possess, as well as with genuine affection.  Rarely have I read a novel with a more authentic sense of place than A HAMPTONS CHRISTMAS.  His descriptions of the physical beauty of this place are so lyrical that these descriptions, by themselves, would be reason to read A HAMPTONS CHRISTMAS even if the story were not compelling.      The story is compelling, however; the premise is unique, the pacing is riveting and the ending is impossible to predict.  Lots of laughs along the way, too: Watch some of the names.  All of this combines to make A HAMPTONS CHRISTMAS a tasty Christmas treat that will leave the reader looking forward to the next book in the series.	2000-11-20

She accurately picks up on the stereotypes of those personalities which so frequently flourish best in Manhattan and East Hampton.  Anyone who hasn't been to these places may not appreciate how dead-on are her portrayals.  With a writing style that is spare and distinctive, FOUR BLONDES makes an interesting read.  Ultimately, all the heroines in it are empowered, making this is the best kind of post-feminist fiction, thought-provoking without being preachy.	2000-11-01

As the former private secretary of the late Princess of Wales, it would be nice to think that he didn't publish SHADOWS OF A PRINCESS just for the money.  On the one hand, the information he offers does seem to be balanced.  On the other hand, there is no doubt that some of the subtext is an effort to excuse himself, in the eyes of the British power elite, for his long affiliation with the late Princess of Wales. Many of them considered her, in his own phrase, &quot;a loose cannon.&quot;  Still, Jephson doesn't excuse himself any more than he excuses Prince Charles or Diana's other in-laws and their large corps of advisors for their contributions to her emotional decline.  This book appears to be an attempt to explicate the forces which pushed the late Princess into that emotional collapse, or to accuse those who, at their least venal, ignored her obvious mental disorders.  It does sound as if Mr. Jephson did his best to shield and guide this woman who, as his account makes obvious, was painfully alone in the world in terms of those who loved her and tried to give her balanced guidance.  There are times when this book reads like a love letter, other points when it is a eulogy and even other sections which sound like a letter trying to explain her to her sons.  He offers up some truths, such as the fact that this one very young woman, uneducated and purportedly not too bright, succeeded in challenging the validity of the very existence of the British monarchy.  In the end, the Princess became too antagonistic to those who might have helped her find a formal place within the royal family, and adversarial to Jephson's own efforts to assist her, causing him to resign.  This is a sad book, and not a paricularly lively one.  And maybe he did write it just for the money....	2000-11-01

What follows is a froth of a book that quietly contains a great deal of depth, ruminations on decency and kindness as well as the morality of gossip.  In the process, Ms. Smith proves that her reputation for being nicest of the gossip columnists is well-deserved.  She's been on a hell of a ride, and she's had little difficulty maintaining the precarious position of participant blended with observer.  Along the way, she met everyone who mattered in the second half of the 20th Century, and with skill, she names names and shares anecdotes.  Some of the people she includes are long-forgotten, but many still are the stuff of tabloid headlines.  She counts among her nearest and dearest Liz Taylor, Barbara Walters, Helen Gurley Brown, Elaine Stritch, Donald Trump, Katherine Hepburn and several hundred others.  Of course, the subtext is that Liz, herself, has led a fascinating life.  This book is like eating potato chips: once you get started, you won't be able to stop!	2000-10-23

As a result, I have not read most of the slightly  hysterical Di biographies, and I have been offended by the few that I did  read.  Still, I do have a certain curiosity about what really went on  behind the poised and gracious facade of the public Diana.  Here, Anne  Edwards has written the definitive work, scholarly to be sure, addressing  the Princess of Wales as an author would any other historical figure.   According to her own notes, Ms. Edwards began this project before the  Princess' sudden death.  The book is detailed and filled a multitude of  exactly the kind of facts that are valuable to anyone with a background in  historic research.  There is a thorough explanation of who the very sweet  and young noblewoman was in terms of her own family's prestigious history  and expectations. The clear conclusion is that this innocent girl was used,  callously and deliberately, to satisfy both the breeding needs and the  media relations requirements of the Royal family.  Yet at no time does Ms.  Edwards appear partisan toward Diana, nor does she engage in imaginative  psychobabble to attempt to understand what made the much-loved (by everyone  except her ex-husband and his family!) Diana tick.  The result is a book  which is the Diana resource that historians will rely on in centuries to  come.  I look forward to reading other works by Ms. Edwards.	2000-08-26

And his earlier mysteries set in glitzy East Hampton, as this novel is as well, were  quick-paced and fun to read.  One only can wonder what happened with THE  HOUSE THAT ATE THE HAMPTONS.           Definitely, the germ of the idea was  intriguing, having to do with oil-rich Arabs and an unspoken but very real  State Department desire to placate them.  Yet that story was buried in THE  HOUSE, taking too long to unfold and then told way too hurriedly--it was  obvious that Brady wrote this book with the most minimal focus; his earlier  works are proof of his otherwise great skills as an author.  In fact, the  whole of this rather short novel reads more like a rough draft, details to  be added at a later date which never arrived.        Instead, Mr. Brady  relies on dragging in many of the real-life celebrities who live in this  area for background color, pretty much starting and ending with this  name-dropping.  Some of the fictional characters clearly are based on other  famous people.  The manner in which they are described here, however, is  too preposterous to advance the excitement of the purported mystery in  which they all become involved.        Mr. Brady never actually captures  the tale he was attempting to tell; even his previously established  characters, from his earlier mysteries GIN LANE and FURTHER LANE, are left  unexplored and flat in this one.        I continue to admire Mr. Brady, and  to enjoy his writing, so I am hoping that if he does decide to continue  this particular series, his next novel will evidence a bit more effort.	2000-07-24

Told from the points of view of three characters, author Vincent Lardo describes the  rhythms of East Hampton, the town in which he and I both live.  His use of  the characters' individual voices is excellent, and the dialogue often is  funny as well as perceptive.  The primary narrator, Michael Reo, is sort of  a modern-day Nick Caraway.  Along the way, Mr. Lardo reveals certain basic  truths, which he notes with the keen eye of an observer.  East Hampton,  indeed, is a peculiar little town, probably with more billionaires per  square mile than anywhere but Kuwait.  Yet the haves and the have-nots of  East Hampton bang up against each other much like bumper cars, except with  amazingly few sparks.  Mr. Lardo gets it: the fashions, the parties, the  sex, the envy, the affectations and pretensions, all of those facts of life  in The Hamptons.  And he uses these details with his own elegant style, to  construct a page-turner that will keep readers absorbed until the final  sentence.	1999-11-22
