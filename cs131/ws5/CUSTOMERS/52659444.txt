Laurents is remarkably inspiring, even when he doesn't necessarily intend to be.  His stories about writing for the war effort, writing radio plays, mapping plots of popular films, and turning out work for deadline demonstrate a TREMENDOUS work ethic and a resilient willingness to write and re-write.<br />..., but gay lives weren't well documented in that era.  Worse, \\"liberal\\" Hollywood was thought to be generally accepting, when in fact the opposite was true.  Laurents was under enormous pressure to stay in the closet, as were most writers and stars.<br />The narrative hops around a bit, but he's a gifted writer, and soon you'll settle in.  If you want to be a screenwriter, read this.  Some of the political nonsense that goes into making a motion picture still happens, even in 2003!<br />Arthur Laurents is an amazing man whom I hope has a magnificent decade as an octogenarian.  If his vibrant words are any indication, then in spirit he'll always be 33 and ready for the next adventure.	2003-01-06

Abrams forces you to go find numerical evidence for statements (I'm using the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau for starters), and to back up what you say with solid numbers.  Thanks to her, I discovered highly lucrative, related fields to the business I was originally intending to start!  By adding some simple enhancements to my original vision, I will probably double my income.  Had I not done the research this book recommends, I never would have known.<br />There are some drawbacks to this book.  For one thing, the fill-in charts don't always match the sample plan sections at the end of the chapter.  And sometimes they ask questions without telling you where or how to find the answer.  But those are minor quibbles.  Overall, it is an excellent book that makes you work hard (as in 40 hours or more), and think about who you are as a corporate entity.<br />The best &quot;proof of the pudding&quot; was when I took a draft of my business plan into a meeting with an accountant today.  Abrams warns you not to use draft plans (they can seem half-baked), but I had no choice... the accountant had to look at something.  She was highly impressed, and instantly grasped the basics about my business based on this tight, well-focused, statistically sound presentation.<br />Thank you, Ms. Abrams.  And to potential readers, what's thirty bucks if you can earn many tens or hundreds of thousands more by planning right?	2002-07-23

Although I've enjoyed many a dinner at their tables (venison, goose, duck... all served with innumerable oysters), I still didn't know how I truly felt about the issue of hunting for food.  The Nugents' book helped me over the hurdle by making a sensible, informed argument for enjoying wild game, and presenting it deliciously.  The Coca-Cola Venison Stew is a must-try... tastes far better than it sounds!  Great book.	2002-05-18

Mr.  Wieseltier's book is meditative and beautiful, more like bedside reading (dip in a bit at a time) than a strict narrative.  I have read with some bemusement the reviewers here who didn't like it.  They seem threatened by an intellectual man who uses his full intellect to consider his faith, or lack of it.  Personally, I found this book elegant, engaging, and full of warmth and even occasional humor.  My own father is dying, and it helped me ponder his circumstances while thinking about my eventual response to his impending death.  Magnificent work.	2002-02-07

Instead of making the author/daughter the \\"heroine\\" who rescues her mother and becomes a saint in the process, Susan Stone sees herself in a dynamic where her mother is the teacher as well.  This is about Buddhist practice, not just daughterly responsibility.  What I like best is how Stone catches herself in moments of arrogance or manipulation that other, less mindful people wouldn't even notice.  She walks through the map of her own behavior and responses, and points out what she did, and what she thinks she could have done.  Her behavior is quite exemplary, but it is also evident that she had enormous help from a mother who *also* worked very hard to do what was right.  The book ends up being an homage to her mother's enlightenment.  My own father was dying when someone gave this book to me.  My first thought was \\"Thanks, but I don't need a book to tell me how to feel.\\"  When I actually read it, though, I loved it, and learned so much about how to honor my dying father, rather than just focus on my own needs, strengths, and weaknesses.  Stone is adept at shifting the focus to the strengths and gifts of the dying parent.  It's a beautiful book, and I hope it finds a large audience.  [...]	2002-01-18

When I began this book, I considered myself as passionate an ecologist as Ms. Kingsolver.  But by the time I'd waded through the umteenth of Deanna Wolfe's or Nannie Rawley's off-putting speeches, I was ready to join the Republican party out of spite.  Barbara Kingsolver is capable of so much more!  She has brought her political agenda to the table in subtle and moving ways in the past, but this time she simply takes an enlightened woman, a dense man, and locks them in a moral dilemma together.  The woman beats the man over the head with her verbal tirades until he says &quot;Oh, you're right,&quot; and changes.  Or else, like Eddie Bondo, he walks off and never returns.  I wanted to grab my pack and tell him to wait up.<BR><br /><BR>The three stars are because she is a wonderful writer, even when she falters as uncharacteristically as she does here.	2001-12-14

Bourdain's prose style is elegant, and his comic timing is absolutely marvelous.   As a long-ago resort restaurant employee, I know that much of what he writes is true, but he still gave me some surprising information.  For instance, I like his Tuesday night restaurant suggestion.  And mussels?  Though I love them, I'll never order them blindly again, unless I know how they have been prepared.  Fortunately, they're a breeze to make at home, so that shouldn't be a problem.  Bourdain writes like a veteran, and makes you feel like a restaurant insider.  His stories about &quot;Bigfoot&quot; (most feared/loved/loathed/admired restaurant boss) are priceless.	2001-09-15

Professor Carter has lavishly re-created a lost idyll that has inspired me to try and create a Red Rose Inn of my very own.  One has only to look at the loving, candid, luscious photographs to know that this book is a rare glimpse into Victorian women's lives.  Best yet, Carter acknowledges the possibility of the women's personal relationships without over-speculation.  She walks the historian's line between possibility and probability, and lets the photographic evidence speak for itself in its own ambiguous way.  A well-written jewel of a book, and a glorious gift.	2000-10-04

In the very early 1990s I was one of Robert Peters's &quot;test&quot; graduate students while he was writing this book.  I did everything he said to do, and he cut YEARS off of my graduate study.

Oh, and don't believe everything you read  in the customer reviews about grad school always being a grind.  I loved  every minute of it, partly because Rob's book helped me navigate around the  unlovely parts.  Now I'm a professor at a major university.

I'm a woman, and before I found this book, I thought I just didn't like sex very much.  The Muirs changed that, however.  Reading their book helped me respect myself, my body, and it helped me understand how men and women  are different, but can work together for something that is both natural and  pleasurable, but not always 100% intuitive.  Just one warning to potential  readers.  This book may well fire you up to try new things.  But don't  necessarily expect your partner to go along with it.  Instead, read it for  yourself, and let him or her find the book and read it alone, without  knowing or suspecting it was your idea.  Many partners are intimidated by  the idea of a sex how-to manual.  But this book is much, much more than  that.  It is truly an introduction to the art of conscious loving.	1999-12-01

He crosses many boundaries (spiritual, emotional) to present a theory of the psychoanalyst  as spiritually aware.

It is undeniably well-written, but Lamott is so cruel to single women that it verges on self-abuse, and by extension, abuse of her audience.<br />Elizabeth Ferguson is a 38-year-old widow who falls desperately, achingly in love with James.  Lamott makes Elizabeth seem like such a loser for being &quot;nearly forty&quot; and unmarried.  For me (also 38) it was like getting punched every time Lamott is hard on Elizabeth, or on her friend Rae.  Rather than identifying with either of them, I found myself wanting to protect them from Lamott's heartless prose.<br />Lamott wrote this when she was still drinking.   *Crooked Litte Heart* was written when she was sober.  The difference, to this reader, was so dramatic... a contrast between concrete and velvet, between a slap and a caress.  While  *Rosie* certainly sheds light on Lamott's earlier processes, it is tough going if you have any sensitivity at all.	1998-06-06
