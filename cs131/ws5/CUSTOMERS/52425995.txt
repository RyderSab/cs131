Whether it will merely be a trilogy or a series that comes out once a month for a few years remains to be seen. The writing style and the reading level reminded me greatly of the Animorphs.<br />The insistence at the beginning of the book that &quot;this is a true story&quot; weakened the rest of it for me, since it so blatantly isn't true. It would have been stronger without this getting-to-be-over-used gimmick of false authenticity.<br />Keeping in mind that I'm a 42 year old mom instead of the target audience of 9 to 12 year olds, I think that fans of the Animorphs will really like this one.	2001-04-14

Both of my kids are starting to outgrow the children's section of the bookstore, and want to read more adult material. I heard that King wrote this book for his 12 year old daughter, so I figured it would be safe.<br />All of the &quot;questionable&quot; material is in the beginning of the book, where the impotence of the king is a major issue. There are several sections that refer to his use of viagra-type products, but nothing explicit. As long as you've already had the birds-and-the-bees discussion with your child, I would not hesitate to recommend it. Otherwise, you may have some explaining to do!<br />All three of us (my 12 year old son, my nine year old daughter, and I) really enjoyed it.	2001-03-03

It's still categorized as a young adult novel, but if you had a hard time handling some of the situations or vocabulary in &quot;The Thief&quot;, you might want to let this one sit on your shelf for a year or two.<br />Ms. Turner does an excellent job of fleshing out the characters and the political situations she introduced in the first book.

Earth is one of those books, because it covers so many  issues that I consider to be hot topics:  privacy, the information  super-highway, restrictions in scientific research, evolution of  consciousness and the future of the entire human race.<br />I read a couple of  reviews here criticizing the shallow characterizations, but all of the  characters seemed like real people to me.  It has a great villain you'll  love to hate, and loads of intelligent people having intelligent  conversations.<br />If you don't like books that jump back and forth between  several sets of characters and plots, then you won't like Earth.

He  follows the story lines that come with the various Magic expansions,  and  has kept up with the material on the Wizards of the Coast website.  This  book does not follow the storyline, and actually contradicts it in some  spots.<br />He was most disappointed by the omission of what should have been  crucial plot elements.

The guy actually invents a  new sin and makes us feel repugnance for it!<br />I don't know why so many  people are referring to this as a kid's book.  I suppose it's because  Pullman's previous books were written in a young adult category, and the  two main characters are pre-adolescent.  Considering that part of the plot  set-up is the transformation of the personal daemon as a person ages, I'm  guessing that some big surprises will be in store for us in part 3 as Lyra  ages. <br /> Perhaps this &quot;coming-of-age&quot; aspect of the story is why  it is thought of as a non-adult book.  <br />But I'm in my 40's, definitely  not coming-of-age, and  this is the best fantasy I've read in the past few  years.	2000-08-09

I won't rehash the plot, but I will tell you  that  Pullman actually invents a new sin, one that isn't possible in our  world, and makes you feel disgust for it.<br />Many reviews are describing  this as a &quot;young adult&quot; book, which I think may unfairly  discourage lots of folks from reading it.  It's just as adult as any other  book I have read; it merely happens to feature a young girl as the main  character.<br />If you're looking for a  fantasy that avoids all the cliches  of the genre, you've got to read this one!	2000-07-24

After the first couple  hundred pages, I thought that perhaps it was a &quot;Haunted House&quot;  story, that the sanitorium was exerting some evil influence on the  characters.  It took me a while to figure out that it was really a fairy  tale, one of those stories in which hapless mortals fall into a fairy ring  and stay to dance the night away, and afterwards discover that a hundred  years have passed in the real world.  <br />Last month my whole family got the  flu, and we were all in bed for almost a month.

I read INTO THE LAND OF THE UNICORNS to my kids when they were toddlers;  now they are 8 and 10 years old!  As soon as the new one is released, we'll be rereading the old one first.  Even though my kids are both excellent  readers, we still have &quot;family&quot; reading every night, including my  husband.  We will all be looking forward to Book Two eagerly!	1999-06-19
