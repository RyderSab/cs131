If he can only return to the past, he feels he might be free. But the quest seems futile. The town he seeks lies at the bottom of a great modern dam made by the River Kronos.<br /><br />How he is drawn back through the waters of Kronos, Time, into the past forms the narrative of John Donner's classic journey. He finds himself in his own clear, light-filled world of youth at a moment of double crisis in the lives of his richly varied family, the Donners, Morgans, and Scarletts. But they are still young. John Donner is an old man. When he tries to re-enter the old intimate family relationships, he is rejected as a stranger, even by the boy-he-was as they stand face to face. Only his mother, from whom he holds himself until the last, cannot fail him, he thinks. Surely she will know him and receive him into the old heretofore never failing love.	2005-08-21

They had even sent him to Washington. Captain Free, they said, when they thought how he had fought for the freedom of the colonies a year before the Declaration of Independence. But few of them remembered that he had been Henner Dellicker in the old country, where he was born beside the Neckar; or the tale of his voyage to the new land in the crowded and starved emigrant ship; or his indentured service in the rich Bayley house in Philadelphia; or of the cruel dicipline that Miss Amity visited upon him; or how he fled the King's jailers to the wild frontier, and returned later to settle his accounts with Miss Amity in a way he had not expected.<br /><br />In The Free Man, Conrad Richter has written of those early Americans who were among his own forbears - the sturdy, courageous, hard-working, liberty-loving Palatine Germans who with the Alsatians and Swiss came to farm Pennsylvania and stayed to win their collective freedom on the battlefields of the Revolution.	2005-08-21

It's not a bad book - but it's not one of his best. The main character of the story is an Adverting Executive who gets sick of the business and becomes a poet. In many ways, Thorne Smith inserted a few of his characteristics into the character of David Landor - working in the advertising field, walking with a cane, etc... The story centers on a love triangle that develops between Landor, the niece of the man he's staying with, Scarlet (his fantasy), and the wife of the local land baron, Helen (his dream). The ultra seductive Scarlet is more than willing to throw herself at Landor, but he seeks the true love only Helen can bring him. Of course, since Helen is married to the wealthy landowner, this poses a problem. Scarlet eventually succeeds in seducing Landor, throwing him into a rage at how he gave into her in a moment of weakness. He continues to see Helen, but her husband notices she's spending more time with him that at home and forbids their meeting anymore. Helen, distraught by the separation grows ill and eventually passes away from a broken heart. David Landor leaves his sanctuary near the salt marshes and heads back to the city.<br /><br />Landor comes back to the salt marshes years later to try and capture some of the feeling he had when he originally came to escape the city. An old man now, he comes upon the house where he originally stayed with his painter friend and Scarlet. There he meets Scarlet, who, years ago, married the wealthy, alcoholic land baron. Landor, upon finding this out, retreats to a deserted shed on the beach, curls into the fetal position, and dies with the words he wrote to Helen on his lips:<br /><br />\\"And now that the storm is past, I shall sing him upward from death.\\"<br /><br />There are some genuinely good moments in this story - very nice scenic descriptions, but it is a definate departure from his humorous works.

And with one, maybe two exceptions, each book in the series is better than the last.<br /><br />This time out Jack takes on two fixes. His first job involves the search for a wealthy widow's son who's involved himself in a questionable \\"religion\\" that mirrors Scientology. Jack's task is to find him and have him contact his mother. Sounds easy, but like all things Jack involves himself with, the task grows increasingly dangerous and complicated.<br /><br />His other fix involves a nun being blackmailed by a common thug. Ritchie Cordova, a crooked private eye, has managed to take a few photos of Sister Margaret Mary in a compromising situation, and has been shaking her down for cash. Jack agrees to take on the case, waving his fee since Sister Maggie is strapped for cash. The payment he received from the rich widow on his other case more than compensates him.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, both cases eventually run together, leading to some interesting plot twists. And you wind up cheering for Jack all the way as he gives the bad guys their comeuppance!<br /><br />F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack has evolved into a great action hero who for the most part tends to be grounded in reality. While there are occasions where Jack miraculously survives, he still comes through as human. There are no Dirk Pitt moments where you find yourself rolling your eyes.<br /><br />Dr. Wilson ties in several bits and pieces from his previous stories, yet the previous books don't have to be read to enjoy this novel. However, I would definitely recommend doing so. You will get a clearer picture of what's going on (The \\"otherness\\"), and further delve into the character of Repairman Jack. Start with \\"The Tomb\\" and enjoy the ride!	2005-06-29

That's a good thing, as perception makes all the difference when dealing with change.<br /><br />But it's sad when such the helpful information within \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" is used for the wrong purposes. What would that be? In some cases it has proven to be a great excuse for management to be, well... bad. Expect change -- it's bound to happen, for better or worse. Typically it's for the worse. You're fired, here's your book. It hasn't happened to me this way, but I know of plenty of other who've had this happen.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, most of the recent reviews have been negative, probably from employees who've been subject to inept management using this methodology as a crutch for EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I guess you could look at this as a good idea that in some cases has been used for the wrong purposes -- kind of like nuclear power. Used for the right purposes, it can be a wonderful tool; if placed in the wrong hands, it can be nothing but trouble.<br /><br />So read it, learn from the simple parable, and by all means, apply it to your life.	2005-05-07

I watched Court TV when I could and became very familiar with all the particulars.<br /><br />Anne Bird is Scott Peterson's older Half-sister. She was given up at birth by a teenage Jackie Peterson, and was reunited with her a few years prior to the infamous murders of Laci and Connor Peterson. While there is plenty of information available on this case, I was hoping for an insider's view, a fly on the wall, as to what was going on behind the scenes. While Anne was an insider, I didn't come away with any thing new.<br /><br />The only thing I really found interesting about Anne Bird's book was her description of Scott Peterson's actions after the bodies of Laci and Connor were found. Since Peterson stayed with Bird and her husband during this time, she had a front row seat.<br /><br />If you've followed this case, you're really not going to find anything new in this book. You'll get some Peterson family history; Anne's take on her adoption; reuniting with her birth-mother, Jackie Peterson; and her thoughts on Scott and Laci's relationship.<br /><br />Other than Scott, Jackie Peterson is the individual who comes out looking like a basket case. She's portrayed as delusional, critical, opinionated, controlling, and, well, a little off her rocker. You'll find out that she had two children out of wedlock (Anne being one of them), given up for adoption; didn't approve of Laci; and Scott was never viewed as anything other than the perfect son.<br /><br />Anne constantly refers to Scott and \\"The Golden Boy;\\" and up until Laci's disappearance, the title fit. The Golden Boy could do no wrong, and was allowed to run back to Mom and Dad when he got into trouble. Bird's opinion is that it was this shirking of responsibility, of not being held accountable for anything, that in some way led to Scott Peterson's inability to cope with being a responsible husband and father.<br /><br />So what will you get after reading this book? If you've followed the trial, you won't learn much much more than you already know, I'm afraid. I got some insight into Peterson's actions and how he was acting when not in the public eye, but beyond that, I really didn't come away from this knowing anything more than when I started. So, no, there's no deep insight into Peterson's psyche; only guesses as to how and why this tragic event took place.t learn much much more than you already know, I'm afraid.

While some grew to prominence, others remained small towns. Over the past century,  Brecksville indeed has grown, yet it's retained its small town charm, as well as a strong sense of pride in its history.<br /><br />Growing up in this town, I've come to know its people and quite a bit about its history. David Borsvold's book does a very good job capturing the basics of Brecksville's origins, as well as providing a variety of images from Brecksville's early years up to today.<br /><br />The author has culled these images from private collections and the Brecksville historical society. They're all very clear, detailed, and come with captions. Some of the pictures have been used before in Historian Dorcas Snow's books, but there are several little gems he's included that have never been put in print, let alone seen the light of day in decades. For instance, there are some great shots of the center of town from various angles from the early teens and twenties, shots from turn of the century family reunions, and shots of the Ohio Erie Canal in action.<br /><br />If you're a resident of Brecksville, this is a good book to add to your library. Get to know the place you've chosen to live, learn the stories behind those landmarks and buildings you drive past every day. You'll see some pictures you've probably never seen before.<br /><br />While it's not the most comprehensive book available about Brecksville's history, it's a good starting point for individuals interested in the city's rich history. Even if you're not a Brecksville resident, if you enjoy the charm of 19th century American small towns, you'll also want to give this book a try.	2005-03-23

How many friends do you have that call 900 number's each month? How many 900 number's did you call last month?

To me, bonds were boring, stale, stagnant, and, well, really couldn't hold a candle to the potential double digit returns stocks and mutual funds could produce.

Don't let that deter those of you that are experienced bond traders -- there are things in here for you too.<br /><br />After reading this, I feel a lot more comfortable adding bonds to my portfolio, as well as talking about them with investment professionals.

Lawrence states he's always been intrigued with the death of Jesus and would like to put the resurrection to the test. This would be done by forming a commission to explore the event and interview the key characters. By insinuating that the resurrection was possibly a hoax, Lawrence angers the crowd and, while at a bar after the show, is knocked unconscious after a fight.<br /><br />Lawrence wakes up in first century Jerusalem, in the home of Joseph of Aramathia, six years after the death of Jesus. With Joseph as his guide, Lawrence has been given the opportunity to take on the role of his fictional Christ commission and interview Ciaphas, Matthew, Mark, John, Peter, Pilate, Mary Magdelane, and Nicodemus among others who had been involved with Jesus. Mandino takes creative liberties with the interviews, but does an excellent job of tying everything together for a satisfactory ending.<br /><br />I'm now reading this for the second time and have enjoyed this book almost as much as the first time I read it. After being bombarded with negative news from the papers, television, and radio, reading something inspirational like this was just the ticket. And Mandino does a great job of providing this inspirational message without being overbearing, and that adds to the beauty of this book.	2004-09-28

There were some grammatical errors as well as some spelling mistakes, but they didn't interrupt the flow of the story.<br /><br /> Keene did a good job of developing believable lead characters (Jim and Frankie), not the easiest thing for a writer to do. He put them in situations where I thought, \\"Yeah, I'd probably do that too.\\" The only character that seemed a little over the top was the by-the-book-crazy military man, whose actions seemed a little canned. He was just a little too evil and sadistic, going way out of his way to make a point. Then again, he was supposed to be crazy...<br /><br /> The novel still has the feel of a first novel. By that, I mean it doesn't seem \\"polished,\\" for lack of a better word. I still enjoyed the story, but that rough feel was always there -- especially in the dialog. There were a few times I think I winced when reading, but they were few and far between.<br /><br /> Even with those few \\"bumps,\\" this is once of the best zombie stories I've ever read. It's not on par with \\"The Stand,\\" but Keene does a good job with a post-Apocalyptic world. I liked the idea that turning into a zombie wasn't limited to humans. Animals, too, were just as likely to fall victim.<br /><br /> Until I found out there was going to be a \\"Rising II,\\" I was really disappointed with the ending. I mean, everything's building to the climax, the point of the story, then... what happened? Wait a minute. No, no, no, that couldn't be the end! Thankfully, it's not -- but the book doesn't make that clear. It wasn't until I checked Brian's website and found out a sequel was in the works.

Only a scattering of people recall today her dramatic fate, though it was the sensation of the time. No doubt she would soon be remembered only by Arctic historians had not Commander Ellsberg, delving into the facts and circumstances of that voyage, found them of the stuff that has made great human drama since the days of Troy.<br />Commander Ellsberg discovered in the half-surpressed logs of the hapless expedition a story of incredible excitement and variety -- a tale of men locked two years in the Arctic pack, of sudden disaster, of desperate flight across the cruel ice, of a wild small boat passage over the storm swept Arctic seas to the barren frozen tundra of Siberia. But more than that, he saw in those events human heroism and courage in the face of such hardships as have never been recorded before nor since. He saw men who had been ordinary sailors and officers transformed by extraordinary occurences -- some into gallant leaders, a few into shirkers and mutineers, others into lunatics, some into reckless martyrs, one at least into a hero whom all men can be proud.<br />No one could be more ideally equipped to make this saga of the Arctic live than Commander Edward Ellsberg. Author of On the Bottom, already recognized as a classic of the sea, himself a brilliant engineer, he recounts of the story through the vivid personality of George Wallace Melville, chief engineer on the Jeannette. A careful research through diaries, journals, Naval Inquiries, and Congressional Investigations enables him to use the actual dialogue and set down authentically the characters of the whole ship's company. Above all, his rare knowledge of men in action and his rare ability to depict them make the reader virtually a member of the most extraordinary Artic expedition in history.<br />In Hell on Ice he takes a musty, never wholly known record and recreates it in the flesh and blood with wild Arctic gales singing through it, with the screech and roar of the tumbling ice floes, the flaming colors of the Aurora Borealis, the smell of sweaty furs, and the cries of men, now hoarse and desperate as they face destruction, now softened by the hope of salvation; while through it all, strangely woven into the fabric of the banner borne along till it falls from dying fingers to the ice, is the presence of the woman who waits at home, in agony looking toward the void of the unknown North.of the most extraordinary Artic expedition in history.<br />In Hell on Ice he takes a musty, never wholly known record and recreates it in the flesh and blood with wild Arctic gales singing through it, with the screech and roar of the tumbling ice floes, the flaming colors of the Aurora Borealis, the smell of sweaty furs, and the cries of men, now hoarse and desperate as they face destruction, now softened by the hope of salvation; while through it all, strangely woven into the fabric of the banner borne along till it falls from dying fingers to the ice, is the presence of the woman who waits at home, in agony looking toward the void of the unknown North.	2004-04-07

As stated in a previous review, it is an invaluable resource for music between the years 1962 to 1982.  It is a guide I've found myself referencing time and again for details on the premier bands from the UK between those dates.<br />In this book you get the bands that made an impact in the UK -- those bands being, The Kinks, The Beatles, The Who, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, and T. Rex.  I originally picked up this book because I wanted more information on Marc Bolan and T. Rex, and I couldn't have found a better resource.<br />While there are more complete books on each of these artists, this book provides the best summaries, hitting the high and low points in each band's career through 1982.  There is also a smaller section in the back of the book devoted to 50 additional hot UK bands.  While not as in depth as the bands mentioned above, each band has a really good summary and detailed chart positions.<br />It'd be nice to see an updated version of this text, but sadly, Schaffner passed away in the early 1990's.  But don't let the text's age deter you -- it's still a valuable resource.  Heck, I still refer to it from time to time, as it provides a wealth of information on these bands.<br />If you have an interest in British bands from the 60's, 70's and early 80's, this is THE book to get.  You'll get more than complete summaries on the groups' histories and chart positions, as well as some good black & white photos.  If you have furter interest in any of these groups, there are plenty of books that will help you, but if you're looking for a place to start, you've found it!	2004-04-07

These folks can gobble down chips, soda, donuts, burgers, cheesecake... etc.  I'm not one of those lucky few.  I was a carbohydrate addict that ate foods that were quick and easy to get a hold of, stuff like pizza, potato chips, waffles, and other assorted freezer foods.  But it never seemed to satisfy me, I always found myself hungry an hour or so later, and I gorged again.<br />The Atkins Diet has worked for me.  I've been on the diet for a year and have followed the rules to the letter.  And you know, it's not all that hard.  It was difficult at first to give up food products that are the norm in our culture: breads, cereals, bagles, and a host of sweets.  But now that I've found alternative for these things, I really don't miss them.<br />As touted in the Atkins program (as well as the South Beach Diet), protein is the mainstay of this way of eating.  But most importantly, this lifestyle change has taught me how to read labels -- how to identify what's good and what's not so good about the foods I used to consume.  What's not so good is the amount of sugar and other empty calories that make up the majority of the food we eat. Stuff I used to ignore until I turned twenty-five and my metabolism decided to slow down a bit.<br />While the book may seem extreme at times, its message is that we've been brainwashed by corporations hat want to push their not-so-healthy products down your throat at the expense of your health and your pocket book.  Heck, if you keep coming back for more, they'll keep making it.  The addictive nature of these foods almost make them as unhealthy as cigarrettes.  You'll also come to see that most low fat produts will have the reverse effect on you -- you might not have to worry about the fat as much as the sugar that's added to make the product palatable.<br />Now that I've been on the diet for a year, I've learned what my limitations are.  While I do eat a lot of meat, I also eat a lot of vegetables, fruit, eggs and some whole grains.  There's a balance I've come to maintain.  As a result, I've lost and kept off a good twenty-five pounds.  The jeans in the back of the closet fit again, my cholesterol has gone down, and I feel good.<br />I've found that the diet seems to be more effective for males than females.  Just an observation, but that's the trend I've observed.  I do see that it works.  But it doesn't work for everyone.  As the book says, I would definitely consult your doctor before doing anything like this.  That is of the utmost importance.  But I have seen positive results from this way of eating and I will probably maintain this lifestyle as long as I continue to feel good and benefit from it.<br />The key is to read the book first -- don't go by hearsay -- there are a lot of misconceptions about this way of eating out there.  But look what it's done to the food industry.  How many low carb alternatives are you seeing out there?  And why are so many people adapting to this?  Because it works.  Read for yourself and see if it's for you.<br />We as a society have been gorging ourselves and getting fat on high carb, low nutrient foods.  They're quick and easy, but they are so unhealthy.  And sure, there are those rare individuals that can eat anything they want -- they're the exception.  But the majority of us out there aren't like that.

Darby Conley has created three lovable characters with diverse, yet unique characteristics: Stachel the pooch with his naive innocence; Bucky Katt with his brilliantly evil little schemes; and Rob Wilco, their long suffering owner, the stabilizing force in the household.  Conley gives each a personality, as well as a few of his side characters (Joe, Rob's Dad, and the neighborhood pets).<br />This is the book that shows you how it all began.  The first few pages show you Conley's rough character drafts (the creation of Bucky and Satchel), along with a little background on how the strip originated.  You'll then get into the first few years of the strip.  I loved every page!<br />This is one of the funniest strips to come along in a long time.  Since we no longer have Calvin & Hobbs or The Far Side, where is one to go for witty, intelligent humor in the daily paper?  \\"Get Fuzzy\\" is the answer.  I hope Rob, Satchel, and Bucky are here to stay with us for a long, long time.	2003-10-23

Paul Wilson's books concerning Repairman Jack, a character that has become one of the most interesting literary creations since James Bond.<br />Repairman Jack is a fixer of situations -- situations wherein someone has gotten a raw deal and wants to set things right.  He has no social security number, no credit cards, pays no taxes, and makes every attempt to avoid the spotlight whenever possible.<br />The Wesphalen family is living under a curse; a death curse placed a century ago in retaliation for the murderous acts committed by a greedy ancestor.<br />Kusim Bhakti and his sister have come to New York City to carry out the curse and wipe out the rest of the Westphalen line.  To assist with this task, Kusim has brought with him the Rakoshi, perversions of the human species brought about eons ago from the Otherness.  You'll discover more about the Otherness in the books that follow.<br />As it turns out, Kusim hires Jack to track down the thief that mugged his mother and return the necklace that was stolen.  Kusim tells Jack its return is a matter of lie and death.  Jack succeeds and returns the heirloom to Kusim's bedridden mother.  Jack is paid the rest of his price and assumes the job is done.  Little does he know he'll meet with Kusim (plus some really mean Rakoshi) again on different terms.<br />Gia Westphalen has broken off her relationship with Jack, yet her daughter Vicky (the last of the Westphalen line) loves him like a father.  Jack still loves Gia and can't bear the thought of never seeing Vicky again.  As it turns out, Jack becomes intimately involved with the Westphalens again, protecting Vicky from Kusim and his Rakoshi.<br />This is an excellent read, and the series only gets better.  You don't necessarily have to start here, the other books can be read separately, but this probably the best place to start to fully enjoy the rest of the books.<br />You'll find once you finish the book, you'll be asking yourself, Tomb?  What's this have to do with a tomb?  Wilson had inteneded to call the book \\"Rakoshi,\\" but his editor requested that he change the name to \\"The Tomb,\\" thinking it'd sell better.  Whatever the case, it's a great beginning to a series that gets better with each book.  Enjoy!What's this have to do with a tomb?

I have to say Edward Ellsberg's &quot;On The Bottom&quot; is as gripping and suspenseful today as it must have been when it was originially released in 1928.<br />This is the story of the sinking of the submarine S-51 and the subsequent salvage recovery.  Ellsworth does an excellent job of walking the reader through the 1920's technology used to do the job: the tools, the limitations, the hardships; and how these brave Navy divers risked their lives to get the job done.  There were many times while reading the book that I could feel the frustration these guys were going through completing tasks that would seem simple by todays standards.  But since we're dealing with technology from the '20's, the simple act of cutting a  cable with a prototype underwater tourch was an ordeal.<br />Clive Cussler must have read this as a child, as the senarios these divers went through mirror a Dirk Pitt adventure.  Yet, in my opinion, Ellsworth's novel reads so much better than a Cussler novel!<br />Get this book back in print -- it is truly one of those forgotten gems that deserves to be discovered by a new generation of readers.	2002-12-02

Prior to reading this wonderful book, I was somewhat of a newbie to the works of L. Frank Baum.  I was familiar with the Wizard of Oz movie, but had never bothered to read the book from whence it came.  Reading Mark Evan Swartz's \\"Oz Before the Rainbow\\" opened my eyes to Baum's additional works as well as the 1903 stage extravaganza based on \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".<br />Before the 1939 Judy Garland film, the 1903 stage adaptation was THE definitive version of Baum's first book.  David Montgomery and Fred Stone were the definitive Tin Man and Scarecrow.  In fact, the play made the team of Montgomery and Stone household names for several years after the play's successful run.  While the storyline of the musical did differ from Baum's original work, you'll be surprised to find out how much of it translated over to the '39 movie.<br />Several adjustments were made to the story in order to get it to the stage, rendering the story vaguely recognizible, but way off from Baum's originial work.  While wary of the many differences, Baum and songwriting partner Paul Tietjens composed several tunes for the show -- none of which carried over to the film versions.  But through extensive research, Swartz provides the words to many of these forgotton melodies -- a real find for any Oz fan.<br />There are also many other interesting revelations concerning the 1903 play as well as the other film versions that followed.  For instance, did you know Oliver Hardy (of Laurel & Hardy fame) played a part in one of the early versions of Oz?<br />This is a great book for any fan of the Oz books or movies.  It's all beautifully arranged between text, documents and pictures.  It'll make a wonderful addition to your Oz colletion and make you want to discover more about Oz prior to 1939.  Highly recommended reading!	2002-11-18

Many people don't know that there's a controversy over the authorship of the plays.  Many of those that know of the issue ask \\"Why bother? Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare, and that's that.\\" I used to feel that way until I fell in love with the works of Shakespeare in college and wanted to know more about the individual who wrote the plays.  Was it Shakspere, the business man from London? or \\"Shake-speare,\\" a pseudonymn used by the 17th Earl of Oxford, Edward De Vere?<br /><br />For me, part of the joy of reading the works of Shakespeare was finding out the history behind them.  The more I read about the man, the more I found academia didn't know much about him.  They had a handle on the times and the events, but not the man.  This raised several questions in my mind:<br /><br />1. Why is there little or no mention of William Shakspere amongst his contemporaries (Jonson, Dryden and Marlowe to name a few)?<br />2. Why is the only written documentation referencing Shakspere concern business dealings. For a playwright and poet as prolific as Shakespeare, you'd think someone would have \\"something\\".  Yet in the centuries since his passing -- little or nothing.<br />3. How could an outsider (Shakspere) have intimate knowledge of the aristocracy? (i.e.: Burghley/Polonius)  There were definite social boundries in Elizabethan times.  Oxford (De Vere) was in that inner circle.<br /><br />These are just a few of the questions readers of Shakespeare have had about the man from Stratford over the years.  Mr. Whalen takes several of these questions and condenses them into a neat little volume, making this a wonderful place for someone interested in the authorship controversy to start.	2002-08-16

I've read the book and now I wonder. Is it possible that Tom Parker and a few select others could have provided the means for Elvis Aaron Presley, one of the most recognized figures of the 20th century, to drop out of sight and assume the identity of his stillborn brother Jesse Garon Presley? I mean could ANYONE (let alone Elvis) have been able to do this successfully for 25 years? Maybe... doubtful.<br /><br />While this is a very short book -- much of it is text mingled with photocopies of Elvis/Jesse's letters -- there is a semi-plausible theory behind it all. I also have to say the Dr. Hinton is persistent in his claims and has put his reputation on the line to defend the work.<br /><br />Based on the information in the book (and elsewhere), 2002 is the year Elvis/Jesse will make his appearance. Going by what's said in the book, Jesse is big, really big into numerology, so there's something in this being the 25th anniversary of his death. I guess we'll all find out when August 16, 2002 rolls around.<br /><br />The only point I'm stuck on is that Elvis/Jesse says that a shot was administered to him to make him appear dead on 8/16/1977. No detail is given as to:<br />1. Who administered the shot?<br />2. What did the shot consist of?<br />3. How did the medical staff a Memphis Memorial Hospital overlooked this why would they forge a death certificate?<br />4. Where Elvis/Jess was found? (current accepted theory was that he was found in the bathroom, face down in the shag carpet)<br /><br />This is the stuff that needs to be detailed. It's one thing to say all this took place, but it's another to leave out specific details necessary to add credence to the story, making it more believable.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Elvis Presley: what the man contributed to society, the image, the music, the memories; so there's a part of me that really wants to believe he has been around and may emerge unscathed. But there's another part of me (common sense) that says c'mon, no way.may emerge unscathed. But there's another part of me (common sense) that says c'mon, no way.	2002-02-13

In a field as &quot;ever-changing&quot; as retirement plan management and pension administration, it takes a special set of resources to keep up with these changes.  Dearborn is excellent, simply top notch with their  securities and insurance publications; but with defined contribution and  pension plans, unfortunately, their data is lacking, too basic, and out of  date.  Emphasis should be placed on compliance testing as well as the  reform bills passed through congress affecting pension plans.  I just don't  feel this is covered here.<br />If you want the creme de la creme of pension  books, get Aspen Publishing's pension answer book series.	2000-05-01

Once the year in question is over, what good is the book?  That's what you run into with Pension books nowadays, material that has to be updated on a yearly basis or it's  woefully out of date.<br />As I mentioned in a previous review of the  1996/97 version of this book, it was lacking in the compliance and  regulatory sections.  These sections are KEY to understanding pension  plans.<br />As a former student of Dearborn's security texts, I can tell you  they are THE source for any of the securities exams - absolute top notch.  But when it comes to pensions, they need to incorporate more detail and  focus separately on defined contribution and defined benefit plans.	2000-05-01

This first book contains all the major carries (Fitzgerald, Eastland, etc) as well as less well known ones.  Worth the  money.	1999-05-03

For a while during the late 70's and early 80's, John Coyne's Thriller/Horror books were everywhere.  Each book he wrote got better and better: \\"The Searing,\\" \\"The Fury,\\" \\"The Piercing,\\" \\"The Shroud,\\" and his best, in my opinion, \\"Hobgoblin\\".  Once the 1990s hit, the author seemed to set aside his pen in favor of working with the Peace Corps.  While his attention is on a good cause, I'd love to see him come back to writing.<br />Hobgoblin is a fantasy roleplaying game based on ancient Irish mythology.  Scott Gardiner is a lonely prep school student who escapes reality every now and then, playing under the guise of his character Brian Boru.  The line between reality and fantasy begin to blur as events and creatures from the game begin showing up in the real world.<br />Unfortunately, this book is currently out of print.  If you want a book with suspense, a little horror and a little fantasy, this one is definitly worth seeking out.	1999-04-11

Dr. Cook knows his stuff and for a story written circa 1986-1987, I don't think it's too outdated.  This is my first stab at one  of Cook's books - I'd probably read more.	1999-04-11
