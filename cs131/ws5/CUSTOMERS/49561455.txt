Hopefully it would be less likely I'd sound like a new age freak when I use some of the language used in the book when recommending a better way of working together.<br />The bottom line: \\"systems thinking\\" has a lot to do with stepping outside of oneself and looking at the entire system almost empathetically.  Sounds squishy, but bear with me.<br />This \\"systems thinking\\" enables one to deconstruct the situation to make more educated decisions.  It's not easy, but with practice, makes for an effective tool that often preempts contention and misunderstanding.  Allow me one recent example:<br />We had been tasked to re-design the product development process for a recently merged organization.  On either side of the widely dispersed team resided processes and associated opinions regarding what was right and wrong.  To each many of the opposing team's views appeared counterintuitive, if not \\"stupid.\\"<br />\\"Systems thinking\\" would have one see that all parties are intelligent contributors who have come to conclusions reflecting often unique situations or constraints, such that their decisions may be in fact quite intelligent.  When each opposing team employed this more global \\"systems\\" approach, each could recognize and appreciate the wisdom of the other.<br />As mentioned earlier, many of the ideas sound quite soft.  At many points the book itself becomes so irritatingly mushy I fought the urge to put it down or skip entire sections.  I didn't read it so I could help fix the crisis in the Middle East.  I'm not currently interested in re-evaluating my place or role in this world.  At times the \\"scope creep\\" is unbearably aggravating.<br />However, the content itself is worth exposing to yourself (and your team), if only because there may be many who aren't familiar with this approach.

As I noted in my review of &quot;The Goal,&quot; I am not a big fan of works of &quot;business fiction.&quot;  I find most irritating.<br />However, this book does an excellent job of rapidly demystifying and acquainting the reader to the Six Sigma framework.  Many people are at first overwhelmed by the whole idea.  Six Sigma, by itself, is a name that sounds goofy.  Within Six Sigma is the idea of the &quot;Demaick&quot; process, which is actually a reference to the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control process (or, DMAIC for short).<br />The topic can quickly become intimidating, which is too bad, because many may not realize they are already performing functions described within the DMAIC framework (the most obvious being the &quot;Pareto Analysis,&quot; more commonly known as the &quot;80/20 rule&quot;).  Six Sigma simply collects many familiar tools into one effective framework, and this book rapidly demystifies the process.<br />I recommend buying several copies of this book, and some in audio form (ISBN 0929071778), and making it available to your team.  The book follows a discussion between two old friends, one from &quot;American Pizza,&quot; the other from &quot;American Burger.&quot;  The fellow from American Pizza describes in detail how they implemented the DMAIC process, and how it affected their business.  The fellow from American Burger reflects on how his failing division could have benefited from following the other's lead.<br />This book is quite entertaining on audio.  Warning: every single time I thought of an objection, the book immediately countered it with a fact or example that quietly put my issue to rest.  This, in itself, was a work of genius.  Even though I read the hard bound copy, the audio is fun because it countered my concerns as quickly as I could think of them.<br />Looking back I've found that this book has driven me to read five more detailed books on Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, and other related topics.  Well worth the price and highly recommended.lated topics.  Well worth the price and highly recommended.	2003-03-11

Working within a large multi-national corporation, I am inundated with \\"new\\" ideas almost daily, and want to see if the lessons learned actually made any difference in my professional life.  This helps me isolate the key points offered from the stuff.<br />Six months after completing this book, here's my take-away: find your worst bottleneck and submit resources to alleviating it.  This is done because the total throughput of your operation is constrained by this (or these) bottleneck(s).  As throughput at this bottleneck improves, and other bottlenecks are exposed, repeat the process.  Ad infinitum.<br />The author calls this the \\"Theory of Constraints\\" (TOC), which is shared here:<br />1.) Identify the system's constraint(s) (i.e., bottlenecks)<br />2.) Decide how to \\"exploit\\" the constraint(s), meaning, how to make the best use of them<br />3.) Subordinate everything else to the above decision (because they are the bottlenecks)<br />4.) Elevate the system's constraint(s) (i.e., improve throughput)<br />5.) Rather, rinse, repeat (i.e., if a constraint appears due to this improvement, repeat the process<br />There's some discussion about the dangers of improper application of Cost Accounting as a success metric, but the most unique thing about this book is its format: a \\"business novel.\\"  It's business fiction.  I'm not kidding.  It's a story about this guy and his factory and his wife and kids.<br />To be completely honest, I found much of this tremendously irritating.  I would have preferred committing precious time listening to a condensed version of the story, without having to keep up with the protagonist's marital problems.  I have to be crass, but I could care less, although his example of how a line of marching Boy Scouts illustrated the evils of variation.  I still can't grasp the value of the numbing details of his marriage problems, and I resent the time wasted when I could have been reading something else.<br />My advice would be to search the web for quick overviews on the TOC, then skip this book and jump directly to recent works on Lean Six Sigma (see ISBN's 0071385215 and 0793144345 for quick primers).  The DMAIC process within this methodology is directly actionable, the ideas presented mirror what's presented within this \\"novel,\\" without the relationship fluff, and the Six Sigma methodology is directly tied to the bottom line, which in the end is all I really care about.problems, and I resent the time wasted when I could have been reading something else.<br />My advice would be to search the web for quick overviews on the TOC, then skip this book and jump directly to recent works on Lean Six Sigma (see ISBN's 0071385215 and 0793144345 for quick primers).

I'll try and save you some time.<br />CEO<br />If you are a CEO, and have not yet been adequately introduced to Six Sigma, I recommend first purchasing &quot;The Power of Six Sigma&quot; (ISBN 0793144345, also available in audio CD).  Once complete, consider purchasing this book (&quot;Lean Six Sigma&quot;).  Read at least the first three chapters, which focus on contributions to the bottom line.

I am a big fan of the Six Sigma methodology, but was often times quite frustrated by this book.  When I wanted more detail on tools within the Six Sigma framework I found myself completing the Yellow Belt course through Moresteam.com.  This book simply does not cover the tools within the DMAIC framework in a level of detail I consider adequate.<br />Many times I found myself laughing because I am not in fact the CEO of this company.  She has already committed to Six Sigma, and we therefore have little choice.  After getting into the meat of the methodology, even after early involvement in TQM and other efforts, I am quite impressed with this latest evolution.	2003-03-11

In the case of \\"Built to Last,\\" I am writing a review a full 3 years after completing this most excellent book.<br />I am not exaggerating, then, when I say that this is among a select group of the most powerfully influential business books I've read. There is something about the methodology, the way the conclusions are presented, that makes it stand out as an excellent read.  The content is, as some would say, quite \\"sticky.\\"<br />Take, for example, their selection criteria for what constitutes an \\"Visionary Company.\\"  The company had to be in business something like 60 years, so they can see how a culture had \\"outgrown\\" their genesis business model (think about that!!!).  They had to be outstanding market leaders, so there is some tie to the bottom line, and so on.  Personally, these metrics have become ingrained, such that I repeatedly find myself gauging where my organization is relative to these metrics.<br />Secondly, the book expands upon each attribute of a \\"visionary company,\\" such as having \\"big hairy audacious goals (BHAG's),\\" or having what some call a \\"cult-like culture.\\"  Each section expands upon each with direct examples of how the identified companies espouse these attributes.<br />For example, there is much discussion on how firms such as Boeing is famous of undertaking aggressive projects (BHAG's), or how Nordstrom's culture is so powerful it's akin to oil and water (the right people just fit; the wrong people are self-ejected).<br />I have found it fascinating, however, to watch the featured companies since completing the book.  HP, for example.  Why in God's name would HP chose to get into the PC business?  This barely appears to align with \\"The HP Way.\\"  And for a while it appeared that Boeing no longer attacked BHAG's when they rejected the notion of a super-sonic passenger airliner, although their involvement in the Joint Task Force Fighter project certainly appeared in-line with their culture.<br />Finally, I have noted many books whose authors were influenced by this book.  Either the book itself was directly referenced, or the ideas were clearly gained from its reading.  My recommendation: buy it and read it.  I doubt you will ever forget it.ement in the Joint Task Force Fighter project certainly appeared in-line with their culture.<br />Finally, I have noted many books whose authors were influenced by this book.

Examples were great because I have been able to easily recall them when explaining why the path I recommend is probably the right one, in a way that never fails to impress the point upon the listening audience.<br />Case in point: the book uses the hard drive industry a great deal as an example of how companies easily overlook the potential of what the author calls &quot;disruptive technologies.&quot;<br />In this case, technology advancements enabled hard drives to get smaller, and the sales/marketing forces within the respective manufacturers' repeatedly failed to see the use or value in a product that begins as simpler, cheaper, and easier to use.<br />You can almost hear the objections: &quot;Our drives have X storage space.  No one is going to buy one with half the storage capacity, even if it is smaller and cheaper.&quot;  No one gets excited about small sales when they are facing big ones with their current product line.<br />So the technology's strategic value is overlooked, and the innovation ends up being capitalized upon by smaller competitors who can plant and grow an emerging market because they get excited about smaller volume sales.  They have the energy and drive to find markets that don't necessarily need the rich feature set associated with the current product.<br />Inevitably, of course, these smaller sales dwarf the originating technology and its associated marketing and sales efforts, by cannibalizing the market and becoming the mainstream product.<br />Clayton's book outlines excellent strategies for companies seeking to capitalize upon disruptive technologies developed within their walls.  They make sense, and are easy to grasp.<br />In all, one of the better books I've read, in terms of short and long term impact to my ability to present solution.

This is done to temper short-term enthusiasm for a book with its longer-term impacts to how I approach how I do business.<br />In the end, I can't remember anything this book said.<br />This is in stark contrast with books such as Neil Rackham's \\"Spin Selling,\\" where I recall fundamental concepts over six months after putting it down.  This is perhaps due to the format of the book itself - in what I call an \\"airport executor\\" format (emphasis on the non-word \\"executor,\\" as if it were referring to an executive superhero pacing quickly through an airport, barking into one of those hands-free microphones and by all appearances talking to him/herself).<br />I bought this book in an airport bookstore, seeking a productive distraction on one of those long east-to-west flights.  I was indeed in the role of marketing and selling services, and I felt maybe this book would contain some nuggets that would help me better understand how to build customer faith in our \\"product.\\"<br />I recall reading the book during the flight, due to its small page format and short length, and I remember feeling pretty inspired, as if I had been exposed to concepts that would really help.  In the end, I felt good about the money and time I'd invested.<br />But as mentioned above, I can't remember even one thing the book said.  I read Collin's and Porras' \\"Built to Last\\" over three years ago and still remember core concepts, examples, and referenced points.  This book left me with nothing.<br />It may be the format: quick sound bites probably designed for guys like me who read them on a cross-country flight.  I felt good about the purchase in the short term, and can't remember what I read about in the long term.<br />Ries & Ries \\"22 immutable laws of branding\\" employs a similar sound-bite format, and has the same problem.  I can't remember one thing the book said about branding, and I read it three times.<br />Perhaps I require deeper rooting in a topic to remember the content.

The truest value this book provides is that its hard bound, written by \\"the guy who wrote the Cambridge dictionary,\\" and therefore immutable.<br />Think about it.  How often do we get into subjective tug-o-wars regarding what users are or are not doing?

Anyone who has tried in vain to verbally impress upon their co-workers the value and learned facts of a Myers/Briggs profiling will appreciate this.  Am I an INTJ, ESFP, or an INTP?

In short, showing parallels between small, disorganized companies and large successful franchises such as McDonalds is compelling.<br />One final comment: Gerber assumes that many in small business hate it and want to do something else with their lives, such as flying kites or something.  He believes that unless you sell your company for a profit you've wasted your time.<br />I disagree.  He ignores the fact some start businesses as a lifestyle, and enjoy it at its current state, not seeking to create the next McDonalds and become millionaires.

Perhaps because you need to troubleshoot printing issues, or because you want to write specialized drivers for a custom system.  Where to start?<br />Many recommend that you can get these sorts of resources on the web for free.  That's is true, but I prefer to take into account the true cost of doing so.  I can't speak for you, but my time is worth more than trying to save a few bucks downloading and printing my own version.<br />Most tasked with understanding PostScript are typically given the monolithic PostScript Language Reference Manual and perhaps a supplement.  If you lack exposure to PostScript, this is a huge and perhaps impossible leap towards PostScript proficiency.<br />This book goes a long way towards helping the reader quickly understand the basic foundation of PostScript.  The book itself is short, small, and easy to read.  In fact, its helpful to imagine it as a &quot;PostScript sing a long.&quot;<br />Most higher end PostScript printers support network socket connections directly to the PostScript interpreter, meaning that you can connect and actually work directly with the PostScript monster.  Write me and ask if you want to know how.<br />I found it helpful to simply sit by a computer with this book, read some pages, then duplicate the programs the book illustrates.  If your printer supports the socket connections, great.  Connect and enter the code directly.  Try creating syntatic errors and watch how the PostScript interpreter responds.  Understanding these errors goes a long way towards effectively troubleshooting PostScript.<br />Alternately, you can enter the PostScript code into files, and download them to the printer.  Most printers support a verbose debug mode, enabling you to see why the PostScript programs were rejected by the interpreter.  This too is rather helpful, educationally and practically.<br />If you need to learn PostScript, and lack any exposure, get this book.  But it will leave you in PostScript first grade...more resources listed in my other reviews pertaining to PostScript.y exposure, get this book.

Plus it was quite helpfil that I was surrounded by PostScript gurus.<br />By the time I got this book it read like a Dr. Suess novel.  Bored, I was.<br />Skip it.	2001-04-06

This is a book intended for those who want to write drivers and stuff.  I'm not that guy.  I just want to know enough about how it works to respond to needs as they arise.<br />You know?  Just because I want a web server on my machine doesn't mean I want to write an HTTP stack from scratch.  I'll probably just find what works and adapt it to my purposes.<br />Here's a specific example relative to PostScript:<br />I needed to create an application for someone who wanted a custom driver that would print different state-related labels on their printed images.<br />Did I run off to the Program Design book to figure out how to write it from scratch?  No way, man.  My advanced status within the cigarette consumption community requires continued proficiency through hourly breaks, thus making this sort of focused activity quite impossible.<br />Instead I looked in other drivers that had what I wanted, then printed to file, viewed source, and then pulled the code out as I felt appropriate.  Quick, relatively easy, and demonstratively slothful.<br />Get this book if you want to learn how to write drivers.  Better, get this book and display it prominently so others think you know how to write PostScript drivers.<br />Just get this book.  Hell, its worth the money.	2001-04-06

Last time this happened for me is when I first encountered the writings of Donald Norman.<br />I got the book last night and read it in one sitting.  It was hard to put down.  Tonight I will be rereading it.<br />It was way worth the money.  I'll be buying more for others.  Its one of those books.	2001-01-17

These authors are certainly qualified to do so, yet skip the ego boost and simply present their findings, making this a valuable reference tool.<br />I have both this book and Jakob Neilsen's book of an almost exactly similar title.  I use this book far more often.  In fact, I've purchased several copies for others on my team.<br />Plus, you can easily read it on a flight.  Some complain that it lacks directives.  Jared accurately states that the immaturity of web interfaces relative to OS specific interfaces creates an environment where the experts are without all the answers.<br />In which case, we as creative people must leverage all facts and make choices we feel most productive.  This book will help the person who approaches problems creatively.  It will not help those looking for cookie cutter solutions for difficult problems.	2001-01-09

I love reading RFC's so its way up my alley.  If you are looking for a Reader's Digest version of how to develop interfaces for complex systems you won't find it here.<br />But if you are one who seeks to augment your own personal toolbox with the findings of those far more wise than yourself, get out your wallet and buy this book.  Its great.	2001-01-04
US	49561455	RQT4TER4PMWV7	0674948394	959128550	We Have Never Been Modern	Books	3	20	89	N	N	Interesting, but hard to read	I'd like to think I'm not a dummy, but this was hard to read.  It looks to me like the book was translated to English by someone who might know more about Anthropology than written communication.  There were times when I felt that maybe it had been run through Babblefish.<br />Dissing of the translator aside, the author assumes the reader is completely knowlegable of all the apparently pretty divisions and differences in opinions between one group of scientists and another.  Man I could care less, unless it leads to an advancement of a science, and I wasn't convinced.  But maybe because I didn't care.<br />There were times where I felt that a greater service would have been done if the soap opera would have been skipped.<br />That said, the book contains some insightful and thought provoking ideas on how societies view each other and themselves.  I found some concepts a powerful catalyst in my design efforts.	2000-10-30

I read it in two days (for hours and hours and hours).  I feel the author did a good job introducing nomenclature for the social elements required for a &quot;social epidemic.&quot;  But...<br />I'd have prefered if I'd completed the book not only with a sense that I'd grasped its primary concepts, but also hold a printed references to the research that enabled the author to come to his conclusions.<br />Stated another way, I see the value of introducing personality types by telling a story, but I'd have prefered if these author observations would have been followed up with more supporting psychological/anthropological/sociological research.<br />The concepts introduced were potentially revolutionary.  They would have been more solid if it would have fascilitated the perpetuation of these ideas by leading the reader into a direction intended by the author.	2000-10-30

This book is a set of essays passing on the lessons of old to a generation who could really gain from an understanding of past and similar events.<br />Each author gets a chance to illustrate how the contentious events following the invention and deployment of printing technology mirrors the frustration of our current explosion of information.  Its scarry how similar things are.<br />But this isn't simply a bunch of writings by a bunch of history nerds.  These guys go way beyond, and its for this insightful vision that the book is worth far more than its asking price.<br />History has a great way of repeating itself, and its powerful to leverage history's lessons if one wants to lift himself above the fog of the tail chasers.<br />One author (sorry, I forget who) talks about how reading morphed from a verbal and social activity to one characterised by silence and solitude, and how the computer may allow us back to the social impacts of storytelling.  This is notable because we all know how much more is retained when you read aloud and when it becomes a social activity.<br />But one essay in particular takes the reader into the dialog of 1500 something or other and I gotta be honest, I don't care _that_ much about history.  Plus, almost all authors make the mistake of assuming the reader knows who they are talking about.<br />There's history buffs and there's those who are interested in history from a practical perspective.  For the most part this book is for the practical.<br />Some of the authors could have benefited by realizing the powerful applicability of their work, and thus written it for the Homo-erectus man like me.<br />But I really enjoyed this book, I read it in just under a week, and I have a two year old and a newborn.  There were times when I was wishing there was a way to write the authors to thank them for their good work.  Then it occurred to me that I could by writing a review on Amazon.	2000-10-30

A great many of the men I have worked with were Tamil and I felt it important to learn about the events that caused this thing to happen, and learn more about why nothing is really being done to stop it.<br />But, like many global events, its causes are rooted in the complicated.  The author does an excellent job of making this clear for the reader.<br />Thanks!	2000-10-30

For the value I've gained in reading its text and following its references I've earned intellectual assets far in excess of the few dollars it costs on Amazon.<br />Its one of those books I've bought several copies of and passed on to collegues.	2000-10-30

I forget how many copies I've had over the years.  I've bought copies for countless young protocol engineers and support fellows.<br />I crack this baby open almost weekly.	2000-10-30

It covers a lot more than just firewalls.  The reader is greatly benefited by a quick read that's full of memorable facts.<br />Its well written, talking about topics that can, in isolation, appear as arcane.  The arcane is framed nicely by a spy vs. spy story that's fascinating.<br />Ok, its not a Clifford Stoll novel, but its still great for those of us who want the nitty gritty details.<br />I can't tell you how many copies of this book I've bought.	2000-10-30

I have a two year old and a newborn.  This topic is of immediate interest to me.  But this isn't why I bought it.<br />As a product designer I wanted to gain some perspective on how we acquire language in the first place and found most of the documentation weak.  Then I found this book.<br />I realy enjoyed reading it.  I left my copy on the plane on a trip overseas and was greatly disapointed by the airlines failure to recover it (I sure hope the cleaning crew enjoyed it!).  So I bought another copy immediately and continued reading.<br />One of my favorite books this year.	2000-10-30

Its not a quick read, but its definately a page turner.  I couldn't put it down.<br />I'm serious.<br />For me, a guy with a solid background in networking and systems architecture but without the classical human factors education required for intelligent product design this one document did a far better job of firmly rooting me in the basics than anything else.<br />Mad props to Norman and Neilsen for pointing me in this direction in the first place.  But with this book I finally felt &quot;full.&quot;<br />There were a solid list of findings I'd never heard of until I'd opened this book.  Not only did this book introduce me to these sorts of things, it also illustrated them to me.  I walked away understanding.<br />Like all of my other faves, this book is opened often.  I've bought many copies for friends (with friends like me...) and I reference it often.<br />Its notable that the most leading edge work today related to this topic is being driven by the same guys who wrote this book so long ago.  Its among my top five most suggested books for those I know who want to take their design to the next level.	2000-10-30

I bought a few copies of this book for new people who may not be related to our usability group but may need to understand what the disipline is all about.<br />I thought it did a great job of teaching this topic to people who  have never seen this stuff before.  In fact the people who read it really  enjoyed it.  Its something like 100 pages long, so its a quick read.<br />My  only beef is the fact that each page has about a zillion words on it, and  its easier for me to scream though a book if I feel like I have forward  momentum, if even only because I'm flipping pages with relatively few words  on it.	2000-06-09

I was pleasantly surprised when I found a second edition  had been released.<br />This book didn't fail to deliver on my expectations of  excellent content delivery.  I mean, for a fellow nerd that Perlman can  sure communicate!<br />For those of us who have had to develop and debug  protocols, this book's background of the &quot;why&quot; behind the  &quot;what&quot; is extremely illustrative and informative.  Its one thing  to review RFC's and IEEE literature, its another to read the pain went into  these defined behaviors.	2000-05-22
