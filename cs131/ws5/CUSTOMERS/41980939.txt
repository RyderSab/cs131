This new book is a nice little summary of the thoughts and dreams of the latter.<br /><br />Edited by his daughter, Cheryl Henson, \\"It's not Easy Being Green\\" is a collection of writings and observations by the great Jim Henson himself, by many of the Muppet characters he created over his all-too-brief time on this Earth, and by the many friends he accrued over the years. The book is divided into segments by theme -- including ideas like dreams, companionship and love. All the things that Henson's creations exemplify.<br /><br />The quotes by Henson himself are reflections of his own personal philosophy, while the quotes by characters from The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, Sesame Street and Henson's many other projects are extensions of that, showing how his beliefs and his heart touched his creations. The quotes by friends, such as Ray Charles, Frank Oz and other Muppeteers famous \\"guests\\" of the Muppets, usually give insight into Henson himself, and how his beliefs touched his life, his work, and by extension, the entire world.<br /><br />The book is also dotted with sketches by Henson -- early drawings of the Muppet characters, various doodles, and even a cut-away diagram that shows how a performer would operate a Big Bird-like suit. It's a nice little addition to a good book.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone not loving the Muppets. I don't know if I'd want to meet that person. And Jim Henson himself was a performer whose imagination was matched only by his heart. This book is a wonderful portrait of that.	2005-09-20

The book is about Campbell, himself, getting cast in a major role (the kind that gets \\"best supporting actor\\" Oscars) in a new Richard Gere/Renee Zellweger romantic comedy. But Campbell's B-movie roots pervade and begin to \\"infect\\" the set... but is it really his fault?<br /><br />This is a weird little book. Most of the story concerns Campbell travelling the country, meeting with one bizarre \\"expert\\" after another to research his role as Foyl, the all-knowing relationship guru doorman. As the book progresses, though, a clear villain emerges and Campbell finds himself -- again -- battling the forces of evil. The only real problem with the book is that the villain's motivation, and the major conflict, are introduced rather late in the story, along with a couple of fairly important characters who should have been brought in earlier.<br /><br />However, as complaints go, that's not a big one. The book isn't intended to be a literary masterpiece -- it's a fun little satire that pokes fun at the Hollywood system from someone who's a small fish in that pond, but a big fish in the outside world of cult cinema. Campbell is a clever, witty guy and he turns out a clever, witty book, and that's what I really wanted out of this.	2005-08-09

For a long time, global warming has been treated as a sacred cow among the intelligencia, something that was indisputable, and anyone who dared question the theory was a dangerous radical. So for one of the most popular authors in the world to tackle the subject in such a manner was pretty brave in my book.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the plot in any detail because it contains so many twists and turns that nearly everything could constitute a spoiler, but our major viewpoint character is Peter Evans, a lawyer working primarily for a millionaire who is beginning to question his funding of a major environmental organization. Evans becomes mixed up with John Kenner, a federal agent who is working anxiously to prevent several acts of environmental terror perpetuated by a group hoping to gin up fake natural disasters to make people \\"aware\\" of the global warming threat. As the novel progresses, Evans' own views on the subject begin to change.<br /><br />One of the things I like most about Crichton is how his books are usually based on actual science, not far-flung sci-fi concepts, and this book is no exception. It is meticulously detailed and researched, and while at some points it can get slightly preachy about the way the environmental movement has exercised disinformation over the last 30 years, every argument made in this book is something to make you think.<br /><br />Some of his characters are a bit one-dimensional, particularly the ones like Ted Bradley, an actor/activist who steadfastly refuses to budge on his own ideas and angrily dismisses those who have a different philosophy. But on the other hand, I've known people very much like Bradley, so it's hard to take off for that. The important thing is Evans, someone who goes in with preconceived notions about the way the world works, and the fact that he is willing to bend when faced with other ideas (not to mention the frequent threat of imminent death).<br /><br />The ending is kind of open -- there isn't much of a sense of resolution to the characters or the situation, but then again, there really couldn't be in a novel such as this one, addressing a contemporary issue that's not going away. Basically, the sense one has when putting this novel down is that there's a lot of work to do, which is one of the author's main messages from the get-go.<br /><br />Your own biases will no doubt be a major contributor to your enjoyment of this book -- if you're rock-solid in your beliefs and unwilling to listen to a different side of the argument, you won't enjoy it. But if you go into it with an open mind, this could be one of the most enlightening novels you'll ever read.h). <br /> <br />The ending is kind of open -- there isn't much of a sense of resolution to the characters or the situation, but then again, there really couldn't be in a novel such as this one, addressing a contemporary issue that's not going away.

I re-read it and found it to be just as entertaining as I did when I was a child.<br /><br />Ozzie is a child obsessed with two things -- jokes and games. His love for the two get him into so much trouble that he winds up faced with the prospect of military school, and decides to run away. A fall from a trellis, however, sends him to limbo where he meets his guardian devil, Bub, who's been keeping an eye on him. He's only got one shot to go back to Earth -- he's got to play, and win, The Big Joke Game.<br /><br />This book follows the same pattern as a great number of children's fantasies, from the Oz books to Harry Potter -- it's about a child ripped from the \\"ordinary\\" world to a place of wonder and magic. Unlike many of those books, however, for Ozzie getting home is literally a matter of life and death. What's more, the purpose of the game is really to teach him some discipline and self-control, and once that moral gets to a kid, it's no wonder the book didn't quite become a classic.<br /><br />Still, it's a pleasant, really fast read that I've never gotten tired of. And come on -- who among us wouldn't jump at the chance to play a life-sized board game? If you're looking for something new in children's books, try to hunt down a copy of this forgotten gem.	2005-06-29

I fell out of reading the Star Wars Expanded Universe some time ago, and I didn't feel energized to get back in until the DVD release of the original trilogy last fall. I've finally made it up to the New Jedi Order series and, with that, its first installment, \\"Vector Prime.\\"<br /><br />I've heard a lot of venom from Star Wars fans, both about this book specifically and about the NJO as a whole, but I was determined to read this and judge it on its own merits and, I must admit, I was impressed. With the threat of the Empire finally put to rest, the New Republic is suddenly faced with a new threat from outside its own galaxy -- a murderous race of aliens armed with incredibly powerful organic technology, a lust for death, and a hatred for the Republic. As they begin setting up outposts on the rim of the galaxy, the heroes of the Star Wars universe encounter them on several planets in several situations. One planet is being overcome by a transformative fog, another threatened by its own moon falling to the ground. A strange plague has gripped people across the Republic, including Luke Skywalker's wife, Mara. And the new enemy has already set itself up to attack from within.<br /><br />It was well-publicized that a major character would die in this book, and since it took me so long to read it, it was inevitable that I'd learn who long before I read the novel, so when the death scene came, I was prepared for it. I wasn't disappointed, though. The character was granted a fitting, heroic death, fitting their station in life and in the Star Wars universe as a whole.<br /><br />The Yuuzhan Vong, the new threat introduced in this series, is an interesting race, something that provides a new challenge for the heroes, resisting their technology and even, to a degree, the Force itself. I'm anxious already to continue reading the series and see what transpires next.<br /><br />If there's any real weakness here, it's probably in the conclusion. The book features a really spectacularly done fight sequence in the skies above the planet Dubrillion, and you're left wondering what's left to go over in the rest of the book... then you get not one, but TWO more fight sequences that aren't quite as engaging as the one you've just gotten past. The ending feels a bit stretched and overlong.<br /><br />Overall, though, I was very impressed with the book itself and with how well it set up the new status quo for the Star Wars Universe. I'll be reading the rest of the New Jedi Order with great anticipation.spectacularly done fight sequence in the skies above the planet Dubrillion, and you're left wondering what's left to go over in the rest of the book... then you get not one, but TWO more fight sequences that aren't quite as engaging as the one you've just gotten past.

It's amazing to see all these early strips, many of which I've never read before, collected in such a high-quality volume. This book, the third in a 25-volume series, includes several significant firsts in Peanuts history -- Linus's first words, the beginning of Snoopy's rather overactive fantasy life, and the first time Lucy ever pulled that football away from Good Ol' Charlie Brown.<br /><br />This book also features an introduction from \\"Simpsons\\" creator Matt Groening. His piece doesn't particularlly shed any new light on the comic strip or on Schulz himself, but it's still a fairly touching piece on what Schulz meant to him, in his career, and that's probably what you can expect for a lot of these volumes.<br /><br />\\"Peanuts\\" was, and remains, my favorite comic strip of all time. This series is something I've been waiting for for years, and I'm delighted to see it doing so well.	2005-05-16
US	41980939	R7HALSCIIA9RI	0786702273	241591433	Bad Dreams	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Okay, but way different	A big fan of Kim Newman's \\"Anno Dracula\\" series, I thought this book would be worth a read. It's much more of a straight horror novel than AD is, without the whimsical use of characters and real-life figures from throughout history. I didn't expect to see that, but I didn't expect the book to be quite as dark as it is either.<br /><br />Newman doesn't completely abandon his tendency to use real people and events in this book -- he delves heavily into the spectre of the McCarthy anti-communism hearings and Marlon Brando and Martin Landau both make appearances of a sort, but for the most part this story is very much of his own creation. An American journalist in London finds her sister murdered and dessicated and seeks out the strange culture that led to her death.<br /><br />The book is much darker, gorier and more explicit than I've come to expect from Newman, and while I don't fault him for trying something different (no writer wants to be pigeonholed, after all), it's not really my kind of book either. So it's well written, well done, just not really for me.	2005-05-12

Sure, it means I have to wait longer for my fix, but I wind up with a much more managable collection that way.<br /><br />This most recent collection collects the last couple of years of the comic strip, including staples like Jason's geeking out for the \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\" movies, and other things like the strip's quiet and touching statement on September 11. In a day where many newspaper comic strips have become bland and homogenized, pale reflections of great strips of the past, FoxTrot remains sharp, funny and clever, with characters instead of caricatures, timely stories that comment on pop culture and the techno world and the occasional flash of brilliance. This is the best thing about picking up a newspaper in the morning.	2004-11-14

In the sequel to \\"Louder Than Words,\\" Sergio treats us to another six issues' worth of silent pages, quick jokes and punchlines. This is a book you can put down and pick up at any time, read any page by itself and crack up.

This book focuses on three children who, one Halloween night, fall in with a slightly eccentric professor who believes in another world ruled by a kind but reclusive creature called a Whangdoodle.

Frank Baum's \\"Oz\\" books, so ordinarily a prequel wouldn't necessarily interest me, but with Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson writing this, I absolutely had to give it a chance. This unlikely collaboration turns out one of the best fantasy novels I've read in quite some time.<br /><br />Like all great \\"children's\\" fantasy, the book is written on a level that's wonderfully accessible for kids but never condescends and alienates older readers. Our hero, Peter, is an orphan who is being whisked away across the ocean for purposes unknown. Aboard his ship is a mysterious trunk and a mysterious girl who seems to know a lot about it. The trunk is highly sought after, and a Peter finds a pirate ship hot on their trail.<br /><br />Each of these writers bring something to the table -- Pearson's talent for writing the fantastic and Barry's sharp comedic wit combine to tell an excellent story that I enjoyed so much I'm anxious to go back and rediscover the original J.M. Barrie novel, just to see how many dots I can connect.<br /><br />The book fills in a lot of the blanks for the original \\"Peter Pan,\\" and one could easily read this and then leap to the original with no further bridges, however Barry and Pearson supposedly have two more \\"prequel\\" novels in the works. I'll definitely be in line to read them.	2004-09-16

They turn out drek like the last few years of \\"Uncanny X-Men\\" and then give the writer responsible for that travesty more work, but they cancel a fantastic title like Sean McKeever's \\"Sentinel.\\"<br /><br />This handy digest collects the first half of that too-soon cancelled series. Juston Seyfert is a teenager with teenage problems -- an absent mother, school bullies, a girl he has a crush on who just likes him \\"as a friend.\\" Things turn around when he finds a Sentinel in his father's salvage yard. This giant mutant-killing robot bonds with the boy, and they start a series of adventures.<br /><br />This fits the basic framework of your classic \\"boy and his monster\\" story -- parallels to the excellent film \\"The Iron Giant\\" are obvious -- but this title has a lot of originality to it as well. It's very refreshing to see a father in a teen story who isn't stupid or abusive, but is instead as supportive a character as you could have. Juston enjoys his new friend, but he makes mistakes too, and he has to deal with them. This is very well done.<br /><br />I missed this title when it was first released. I'll definitely pick up the second (and sadly final) digest that collects the book. And then the voices will get raised to ask Marvel to give this deserving title another chance.	2004-09-15

I find it hard to believe that the person who claims this book doesn't offer &quot;a shred of evidence&quot; against Michael Moore has actually READ it. The book is almost nothing BUT a page-by-page refutation of the outrageous lies, misdirections and twisting of the facts that Moore spews in all of his books and faux documentaries. As someone who's gotten sick and tired of this man being treated as though he were a legitimate force for social change instead of a two-bit huckster who found a bullhorn loud enough to get attention, this book was refreshing, entertaining and informative.<br />Not to say it's perfect. The writers do a great job of dissecting Moore's arguments and showing exactly how he twists the facts time and time again, but occasionally they stoop to the sort of low personal attacks Moore himself is so guilty of. (The chapter where they analyze his personality and declare he must suffer from a Narcissistic Disorder is the best example of this.)<br />But those segments do not detract from the book's message in the slightest. This should be required reading for anyone who walks out of one of Moore's films thinking they've just seen a damning condemnation of the government, business, or anything else other than Moore himself.	2004-07-14

I was surprised to find that the book is actually several different books in one. The basic concept is that Murphy spent an entire year going to the movies every single day. The book that resulted from this experiment was sometimes a movie review (such as where he called &quot;Dude, Where's My Car?&quot; an &quot;infected lump of pig offal&quot;), sometimes a travelogue (such as the chapter where he visits the smallest movie theater in the world) and sometimes just a love letter to the art of film. For all the years Murphy has spent tearing apart terrible movies, he is clearly someone who loves movies, who wants to see them elevated to their highest form. This book is funny, entertaining and thought-provoking... well worth it for any movielover.	2004-07-05

In this penultimate installment, Susannah Dean has been taken away to our world to have her baby, the &quot;Chap&quot; really mothered by another soul in her own body, Mia. Her husband and friends, her Ka-Tet, prepare to pierce the doorway between Mid-World and our world to rescue her, but the rescue, of course, does not go as planned.<br />In an odd way, I love this book for the same reason I love the film &quot;Big Fish.&quot; Both of them, when you get down to it, are stories about STORY itself. In BF, it was the importance of Story. &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; is about the POWER of Story, and some of the things King does here are quite remarkable. He'll catch flack from some (no doubt) for writing himself as a character in the book, but it's not like he's the first author ever to do that. (Isaac Asimov's &quot;Murder at the ABA&quot; comes to mind.) Furthermore, he almost HAD to. This is clearly a tale that has defined his life -- Stephen King is as much a part of this as Roland of Gilead, and for good or ill, the quest for the Tower will involve them both together.<br />One book left. The tension mounts. All that remains is the question of who shall live, who shall see the Tower, and who shall stand and be true.	2004-06-16

Buoyed by wonderful artwork by Ed McGuiness, in this volume President Lex Luthor cons the Earth into believing that Superman is responsible for a planet-killer sized asteroid of pure Kryptonite that is falling towards the planet. Superman and Batman, with their few loyal allies, have to avoid the heroes trying to capture them, bring down the corrupt Luthor, and save the world from the meteor.<br />The key to this book is contrast.

It took me a few years to find them all, but I finally finished my little project with \\"Glinda of Oz,\\" Baum's final outing. Not one of the best books in the series but not one of the worst, either, \\"Glinda\\" falls somewhere in the middle. While visiting the good witch Glinda, Ozma and Dorothy learn of two factions living in a remote corner of Oz that are planning to go to war. Wanting to prevent such discord in her paradise, Ozma and Dorothy travel to this land to prevent the Skeezers and Flatheads from coming to blows, but wind up becoming prisoners in an island beneath a lake.<br />The biggest problem I have with this book, as with many of the \\"Oz\\" books, is that just because the title has a character's name in it doesn't mean he or she is the star. While this is one of Glinda's bigger roles, it's not really her book but more of an ensemble piece. Baum, as if he knew this would be his last outing, crams nearly every character he'd created into the rescue party that sets out to free Ozma and Dorothy (but no Hungry Tiger, sadly), and most of the characters featured in that rescue don't have much to do but stand around befuddled.<br />The story has a fair amount of magic and introduces a few new characters, but no particularly memorable ones. Though there's nothing really bad about it, the book is noteworthy mainly because it's Baum's last before he died and Ruth Thompson took over the series.<br />Wow. All this time and I've finally finished reading Baum's \\"Oz\\" books. Heh. Time to start looking for the ones written by everyone else...	2004-05-27

I love &quot;Peanuts.&quot; Wholeheartedly and without judgment. I think Charles Schulz was the wisest man who ever lived. I think that if aliens ever come to the planet Earth and want to understand what it really means to be human, they need look no further than these comic strips.

That was the best part of this hardcover, collecting the first two years or so of the comic strip. For the first time since Sparky's passing in 2000, I was reading &quot;Peanuts&quot; comics I'd never read before.<br />The book also contains a few text pieces, including a really good extended interview with Schulz himself that reveals some interesting things about his idea of comics.

In &quot;30 Days of Night,&quot; a small Alaskan town was beset by bloodthirsty vampires during a month-long period of darkness. In this series we follow one of the survivors, the wife of the sheriff who sacrificed his life to save the town, as she fights to make the world believe in the menace that destroyed her husband.<br />Niles has an incredible ability to take concepts as old as vampires, zombies and werewolves (in his Cal McDonald stories) and find new and intriguing angles to view them through. We get to see a woman try to convince a skeptical world that vampires are real, that they have worked for centuries to cultivate the belief that they are fiction, and that they are very dangerous. Niles doesn't go for the easy ending, either -- this is a story even more brutal than &quot;30 Days,&quot; and one that leaves you shivering.<br />Ben Templesmith's artwork isn't something I'd always go for, but it fits the tone of these stories perfectly -- scattershot, disjointed... horrific, but with a strange elegance to it.<br />This is one of the best horror comics on the stands these days, and I can't wait for the paperback of the third book to hit the shelves.	2004-05-13

I loved it and knew I'd have to snap up this trade paperback when it was released. This collection of the five-part &quot;Criminal Macabre&quot; (as well as the short &quot;A Letter From B.S.&quot; that appeared in a Dark Horse anthology title) is another great story of Niles' detective hero. Cal McDonald is an old-fashioned hardboiled detective, with one major difference. McDonald sees monsters... everywhere. Vampires, werewolves, ghosts and ghouls are a normal part of his world, and when the monsters start disobeying the rules they've adhered to for centuries, something nasty is up.<br />This is a great detective/horror story with a wickedly healthy dose of dark comedy as well. Ben Templesmith's art style doesn't work quite as well here in Niles' more strictly horrific &quot;30 Days of Night,&quot; but it still conveys the story well enough and creates a suitably creepy mood. All things told, this was a great graphic novel and I can't wait for whatever Niles has next.	2004-04-28

It was around page 300 that it began to lose me. The story focuses on Abner Cray, a photographer that comes to New York City to work on a book and winds up falling in love with a woman he meets in the apartment he is subletting from a friend. As he wanders the city he finds unusual things from out of a nightmare, and begins to learn that his new love may not be what he thinks.<br />Wright has a wonderful, engaging style of writing, the sort of style that reads quickly and keeps you turning the page to see what happens next. The problem is that you still feel that way after the last page. There's no sense of conclusion to the book. You don't get a feeling of resolution for Abner, you only get a hint of resolution for Art, and subplots about the deaths of his parents, estrangement from his family and a superfluous subplot about an incestuous relationship with his cousin never go anywhere at all. At the ending you get a feeling that the writer intended the book to have an unresolved feeling, implying that's how life (and death) is, but instead I was just left unsatisfied.<br />Wright's style is good enough to make me interested in reading some of his other works (this is the first book of his I've read), but if the second one doesn't give me a more fulfilling read than this, there probably won't be a third.	2004-04-14

In 64 swift pages James Howe has Dorothy encounter Mr. Tinker, the inventor that created Tik-Tok the Clockwork man, brings them to Oz where they encounter a group of babies called the Widdlebits, send them across the bottomless swamp and finally make it to the Emerald City before Dorothy is sent off home again. The few new characters that are introduced are cute, but not particularly memorable, although Howe's portrayal of Tik-Tok's creator is amusing.<br />The story is over and done with very rapidly, though, and won't satisfy long-time Oz fans looking for a meatier tome. However, if you've got a small child learning to read and you want to introduce him or her to the wonders of Baum's Oz, this wouldn't be a bad place to begin.	2004-04-08

Not only is Marvels one of my favorite comics of all time, but the extras packed into this book really show how collected editions are starting to become the DVD equivalent for comic books.<br />In &quot;Marvels,&quot; Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross took us through the life of photojournalist Phil Sheldon, an old-fashioned newspaperman with printer's ink in his veins and a camera to his eye. Phil, however, lives in a more fantastic universe than you or I, he lives in the Marvel Universe, home of Captain America, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and the X-Men. Through four issues, we watch how Phil and his world grew and changed, how people thought about the superheroes -- the Marvels, as Phil called them -- and how perceptions evolved along the way. It's a beautiful, poignant series about ordinary heroism, hero worship, and the heroic ideal. Ten years later, it's still one of the best comics I've ever read.<br />If you've already read the comics, though, there is still stuff here for you. This collection includes the four pitches Busiek and Ross went through to get the series made, the complete scripts for all four issues, character sketches, production and promotional artwork, a guide to &quot;Easter Eggs&quot; in the artwork, a section on Ross' technique of painting from photographed models and even the text of all the newspaper articles that only partially appeared throughout the series. It's packed, and that makes the reading all the more fun.<br />If you've never read &quot;Marvels,&quot; you're missing out. If you read it and loved it, this book takes the story one step further. Kudos to Marvel for putting out such a great edition of such an important comic book.	2004-04-06

Kurtz did six issues of a comic book based on his strip for Dork Storm Press before moving over to Image Comics -- this paperback collects those six issues.<br />Kurtz was still in the learning stage when he started this comic -- the first three stories are quite short, although entertaining. The third issue, a take on Manga and Anime, is particularly wild, but may be confusing for people not into that sort of thing. Starting with the fourth issue, the &quot;PVP Christmas Special,&quot; Kurtz hit his stride. The Christmas story is a send-up of everything from &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; to &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; to &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; with jokes from sources as various as Superman comics, the Battle of the Planets cartoon and Isaac Asimov. Issue five, a Matrix parody, pokes just as much fun at the current state of comic strips as it does of that movie, and the last story in the collection is a gut-busting yet oddly sweet tale about Skull the Troll trying to reunite estranged lovers Brent Sienna and Jade Fontaine. The book also gives us several pin-up pages and, for those of us who are into that sort of thing -- a roleplaying module that will allow you to game as the superhero characters the PVP crew plays in the comic.<br />This is a great packaged and a great value for a pretty good price. PVP is a wonderful strip, and it's impossible for anyone with a heart not to find something to love in this collection.	2004-03-06

Frank Baum (in my opinion) was not an easy task, and \\"The Tin Woodsman of Oz\\" didn't quite measure up. When a child called Woot the Wanderer (a bizarre mixture of Button-Bright and Ojo the unlucky) meets up with the Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow, the Woodsman gets to thinking about Nimee Amee, the Munchkin girl he was engaged to ages ago before the Wicked Witch enchanted his axe, resulting in the mishaps that led to him being tin. Realizing he's still technically engaged to her, he, the Scarecrow and Woot set off to find Nimee Amee and make her Empress of the Winkies (the Tin Woodsman himself being Emperor).<br />The big problem with this book is that it doesn't really add enough to the Oz mythos. While certainly the universe didn't really change or evolve much from book to book, most of the better titles either told a really amusing story or added new and interesting characters. The only new characters we really meet this time out are Woot, who is just like most of Baum's child characters, and the Nick Chopper-clone Tin Soldier. The story itself isn't really that engaging either, save for a welcome addition of Polychrome and a side-plot where the characters are transformed into animals. That plot is resolved quickly and easily, though, as are a lot of the vignettes in this book -- encounters with dragons, a jaguar and a straw-eating monster in an invisible country all end quickly without particularly progressing the story or doing anything but adding a few chapters.<br />It's not a terrible Oz book, but ultimately, it's rather forgettable. Baum did much better in his time.	2004-03-03

This time out, Vimes is being sent as an ambassador to the distant land of Uberwald to meet with the new Low King of the Dwarfs. Meanwhile, Angua has disappeared and Carrot resigns his position with the Watch to search for her, leaving Fred Colon in charge.<br />Pratchett returns to some of the monster elements he used in \\"Carpe Jugulum\\" -- the vampires and a closer examination of werewolf society. He took these elements and effortlessly blended them into a mystery for Vimes to solve involving a sacred Scone and a few inconvenient murders.<br />For once, I didn't feel like there was any \\"filler\\" story in this book. I was involved in the Vimes/mystery storyline, swept up in Carrot's quest for Angua, and left rolling on the floor clutching my side at poor Colon's efforts to run the Watch as he grows increasingly paranoid about the quantity of sugar cubes in his office.<br />Although the titular Fifth Elephant doesn't really play much into the plot at all, except for providing an explanation for a natural resource that makes this odd country important, this ranks as one of the best in the Discworld series. Funny, smart and a great read.	2004-03-03

Then, for no apparent reason, Rieber was removed from the book in the middle of this story arc and replaced by Chuck Austen, who treated us to inane characters, insipid dialogue and contrived soap opera plotlines that were enough to get me to drop the book. (And having been a Captain America reader for close to a decade, that was not an easy drop for me to make.)<br />As far as the artwork goes, Jae Lee did a marvelous job as always. He manages to fit superheroes into his darker style without losing what makes them majestic in the process. But he was saddled with such a lousy story and bad dialogue that you just wind up wishing he could have given his talents to something more deserving instead.	2004-03-02

As a columnist at the comic book website Comixtreme.com, a few months ago I asked my readers to rank the best graphic novels I'd personally never read, with the promise that I would try to read some of them and come back with my comments. This was one of the books that topped the list, the introduction of Mike Mignola's &quot;Hellboy,&quot; and since there's a movie coming out later this year, I thought this was the perfect chance to check it out.<br />This is a decent little action tale, with Mignola and scripter John Byrne presenting our hero, a strange, demonic creature found as a child and raised by humans to be an agent of a sort of supernatural secret service. We also meet several of Hellboy's comerades, including my personal favorite, the amphibious Abe Sapien.<br />At the end of this graphic novel, though, I'm not left feeling like I've really gotten to know any of the characters. This book exists mainly to set up the situation -- Hellboy's origin, his occupation, etc. Hopefully future installments will get more in-depth as to who he really is, and not just in your standard superhero sense, but in a deeper, character-building sense as well. Still, this is a fun read and a nice place to start. It's good enough to have me on the lookout for Hellboy Vol. 2.	2004-02-09

The only other books of his I've read have been \\"From the Corner of His Eye\\" and \\"By the Light of the Moon.\\" I enjoyed both of them and I enjoyed this one too, perhaps even more, but I did have problems with it.<br />This time out our hero is young Christopher Snow, a man with a rare disorder that makes his skin extraordinarily sensitive to light. As such, he has lived his life indoors and at night, and on the night his father dies, he begins to learn that the little town of Moonlight Bay may carry many more dangers than he ever anticipated.<br />In essense, this is a science fiction/horror tale and it's a pretty good one. Realistic monsters, both human and beast. A likeable hero and a good supporting cast. A character with guts, getting through a lot.<br />But there are some things I didn't like too. The prose is really, REALLY purple in this book. Okay so Chris, our first-person narrator, is a best-selling author. That doesn't mean every line in the book should read like it's dripping out of a college English textbook. Second, Koontz returns to his Superdog character that seems to pop in to several of his books. This time out, Orson proves to be my favorite of Koontz's Superdogs, but it's still overdone. And finally -- this is a book that has a sequel. That's all well and good -- it was published six years ago and I knew it had a sequel before I started reading it. The problem is that I could smell that sequel coming. I mean REALLY strongly. As I reached the final segment of the book I found myself thinking, \\"There's only 40 pages left. There's no way he can wrap all this up in 40 pages.\\" I was right. Koontz leaves an awful lot dangling. That's usually okay, I don't mind sequels, I just don't like seeing them coming a mile away.<br />I'm not saying this to put anybody off reading the book, I did enjoy it and fully intend to read the sequel in the near future -- I'm just giving an honest opinion on what I feel are the weak points of an overall good read. Do with it what you will.what I feel are the weak points of an overall good read. Do with it what you will.	2004-02-05

Since they probably weren't anticipating doing a second volume of this when the first book was published nearly a decade ago. it's not surprising that the selection of stories isn't quite as good. Still, they're all classic Archie Comics.<br />This volume seems to focus mostly on Betty and Veronica, with Archie being little more than a supporting player in most of the stories and with Jughead existing to bail him out of trouble. It's interesting to note how much the characters have evolved over the years while the situation has remained the same -- Betty is the same sweet \\"girl next door\\" she always was, but she's not quite as despondant as she used to be. Veronica is still the spoiled rich kid, but she's softened a bit.<br />It would be interesting, once I've gotten the whole collection, to read the entire \\"Americana\\" series in one lump, just to see how much things changed over the years. I've got a new project to work on...	2004-01-30

I wasn't disappointed. There's no point in recapping the plot for you at this point -- there are hundreds of reviewers doing that, and a fair number of them spoiling it as well, but I will tell you what I liked about this book. I've always loved the way King has linked all of his stories together, creating universes that all tie up. The inclusion of Father Callahan in this book, while a plot point we've all known about for a long time, was a great touch and really helped to drive home the point that, in the worlds of the Tower, all of Stephen King's stories are really happening. The self-referential stuff doesn't bother me in the slightest -- if you want a REAL self-referential novel, check out Isaac Asimov's &quot;Murder at the ABA.&quot; Now THAT'S overkill. King uses himself as another tool in the story. Furthermore, he doesn't just reference himself, but branches out and includes other works of literature, showing that maybe the worlds of the Tower do not end with the worlds of Stephen King. It's an amazing book that will have you looking everywhere to find out what happens next. This has easily taken its spot as my favorite of the series... at least until &quot;The Song of Susannah.&quot;	2004-01-29
US	41980939	RSRGH1DLHOOY2	0971633827	4974001	The Liberty Project	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Great stuff by Kurt Busiek	The government manages to capture a quartet of super-powered criminals and offers them a choice... they can either serve their time in prison, or serve their country as superheroes. If the premise sounds familiar, it's because it is -- DC Comics used an almost identical premise in its &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; series that was launched just slightly earlier than &quot;The Liberty Project.&quot; But the similar theme does not detract at all from this older work by Kurt Busiek (Marvels, Astro City) and artist James Fry.<br />Busiek was clearly flexing writing muscles that would ultimately make a much bigger mark for him in the comic book world -- in fact, a great deal of this series can't help but remind you of his &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; series for Marvel, in which a band of villains masqueraded as heroes in a plan for world domination.<br />Where Busiek succeeded was in creating memorable characters -- angry Burnout, confused Cimarron, repentant Crackshot and the leader/not a leader, Slick. The sad thing is that these characters got lost after just eight issues and a special, leaving a lot of questions unanswered about their pasts, present and future.<br />The book is a nice, compact package -- not quite as small as a CrossGen &quot;Traveler&quot; comic but smaller than your regular trade paperback. Also, shot in black and white, the artwork maintains a very nice quality and is not hurt at all by the miniaturization process. This book looks just about as good as it possibly could.<br />Check this book out if you're a fan of Busiek. Spread the word, seed new &quot;Liberty Project&quot; fans. Busiek still owns the characters, after all. Hopefully someday he'll bring them back and we'll have a chance to find out where they all went.	2004-01-28

Even when he's in a bad movie (and he's made his share), the man himself is usually funny. This book is a fantastic little piece in which he pretty much emptied his mind of all the screwy, random thoughts that had been rattling around and turned them into strange essays about... well... anything. Politics, a day in the garden... my personal favorite was a great piece about a sudden shortage of a certain punctuation mark. The synapses in this man's brain make quantum leaps to connect the oddest things and turn them into something utterly histerical.<br />Drivel? Perhaps.

Together with Scott Beatty, he did a great retelling of the original Batgirl, getting rid of some of the campier elements from her 60s-era debut and making her a powerful female superhero. The writers also managed to work in some foreshadowing to future events in Barbara's life such as her relationship with Dick Grayson (a.k.a. Robin I, a.k.a. Nightwing) and set up the pieces for her eventual role in \\"Birds of Prey\\" -- also a great series. The artwork in this book has a very clean style, almost a hybrid between traditional comic book artwork and the style you see on \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" People who like the character will be in no way disappointed... although I must admit, I find it very interesting (almost amusing) that Barbara Gordon's Batgirl seems to have a lot more fans now than she did before the Joker put a bullet in her spine in \\"The Killing Joke.\\"	2004-01-26

The characters in the book are on a journey, as usual, but instead of trying to get to the Emerald City, the characters are departing that city to find the missing Princess Ozma who, along with most of the powerful magical objects in Oz, has vanished. Furthermore, Baum puts together one of the largest primary casts ever in an Oz book, including Dorothy and Toto, the Wizard, the Patchwork Girl, the Sawhorse, the Cowardly Lion, Betsy Bobbin and Hank, Trot and Button-Bright and the Woozy, as well as adding the Frogman, Cayke the Cookie Cook and the Big Lavender Bear and the Little Pink Bear.<br />While it's nice to see to many characters, it does hurt the book somewhat -- it shows really how superfluous Besty and Trot are with Dorothy around, and it includes a bizarre little subplot with Toto that doesn't really add much. Furthermore, the ending is really syrupy and saccharine, even for an Oz book.<br />The addition of the Frogman is a major plus, though -- he is easily the most entertaining new character added to the series since Scraps the Patchwork Girl, and it was nice to have a book that for once didn't rely on the old villains like the Nome King or the old deus ex machina of Ozma's magic picture and Glinda's magic book. In fact, I kind of wish those two items had stayed lost -- other Oz books rely on them entirely too much for their resolution.	2004-01-22

This was the first book I could find.<br />Set in the small, sheltered town of Barrow, Alaska, this story concerns a troupe of vampires who conclude that holding a \\"meeting\\" in a town so far north that the sun does not rise for 30 days each winter will be like a month in paradise. For the residents of Barrow, though, it's hell.<br />I liked \\"Love Me Tenderloin\\" for the smart, sarcastic sense of humor Niles brought to the supernatural. This book is on the opposite end of the specturm -- bleak and violent, but still with a strong, human core. It's a great read that will not disappoint any horror fan. I just can't wait for the Dark Days trade paperback (the sequel) OR the movie.	2004-01-19

There are more of the &quot;thumbnail&quot; versions of scripts, and some that are so detailed it's almost like reading the comic itself. Standouts in this book are Gail Simone's hilarious script for &quot;Killer Princesses&quot; and Scott McCloud's thumbnail script for &quot;Zot!&quot; (This was one of the super-detailed ones, it had me wanting to find the issue that followed it to find out how the story ended!) Others are interesting, such as the classic &quot;Fatman&quot; script -- but that one, unfortunately, was missing several pages. It was interesting to see the juxtoposition of the original script with the finished pages, however, so we were able to compare what changes the artist had made.<br />Overall, though, this book doesn't really add much or tell you anything you didn't know after reading &quot;Panel One.&quot; It's an interesting addition, and certainly not a bad purchase, but it's not something you need or that helps as much as the previous book.	2004-01-07

Richard Curtis, in this book, tells a bit about how the film came about, shares some scenes and storylines that were cut (some before filming, some afterwards), and of course includes the script. With so many storylines being juggled around it would have been quite easy for this story to get jumbled or confusing, but Curtis balances all nine stories perfectly. For those still a bit confused, however, Curtis includes a &quot;family tree&quot; in this book that shows how everyone in the film is linked to everyone else.<br />The book also includes a gallery of posters for the movie, &quot;Love&quot; Q&amp;As filled out by the stars (you'll be quite surprised to learn which ones are cynics and which are romantics at heart), and tons of photographs throughout. I got this book because, as a movie geek, I wanted to read the screenplay to get a feel for how to write such a story, but this book turned out to be a wonderful volume for those who are just fans of the movie as well.	2003-12-23

He traces a life that lasts over 1700 years and explains how every well-known story of Santa Claus came to be, mixing in science with magic and throwing in actual historical figures to color the piece. (You'll never believe who some of Santa's &quot;helpers&quot; actually turn out to be.) He takes the character through the dark ages, through the Victorian era, mixes him in with European and American history and literature and finally brings it all together in the present day.<br />The book doesn't have much of a climax, but that's because it is written as an &quot;autobiography,&quot; not a novel. The stories just stop because they've all been told... for now. That's part of the miracle -- the knowledge that Santa Claus will outlast us all and continue bringing his true gift, hope, to children all over the world long after you and I are gone. It's a wonderful book,and for people who love Christmas, I can't recommend it enough.	2003-12-17

The story actually concerns Prince Inga of Pingaree and King Rinkitink of Gilgad on a quest to find and rescue Inga's parents, the King and Queen.<br />It is obvious reading this book that Baum was growing frustrated with how his Oz books had so greatly overshadowed his other works, and in fact, this would have been a better title without the Oz connection at the end. Instead of allowing his heroes to complete their adventure on their own, Baum turned to the already-tired deus ex machina of the Oz books; Glinda's magic book and Ozma's magic picture. Like in several books before, this allowed the more familiar Oz characters to take note when the heroes of the book were in danger, convieniently wait until 200 or so pages had passed, and then swoop in to save the day.<br />I bought this book out of a desire to read the entire Oz series, but frankly, I preferred the book before Oz became an issue. I sympathize with Baum's frustration. It's a shame that he felt the need to express it with a weak ending that hurt a good book.	2003-12-09

There is a reason for that, though -- its not intended to. The authors tell you right up front that this will be more of a hint guide than an in-depth analysis, as the previous book was, and that another book with the in-depth analysis is coming, so you shouldnt fault them for that.<br />It doesnt read on its own as well as the previous book, but again, they tell you that in the introduction. I read pretty much the whole book in one sitting, and while it didnt set any fireworks off in my brain like the previous book did, I do intend to keep it handy the next time I read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Ill be waiting for the comprehensive unofficial guide to that book next year, though, at which point I suspect this slender volume will be retired, at least from my reading rotation.	2003-12-08

This is not that storyline, however -- it's a rehash of the story years down the line filtered through the perceptions of a stereotypical comic book &quot;crusading journalist&quot; type. The new characters are dull and the old characters don't really add much to the story that we didn't get ten years ago when it was printed the first time.<br />If anyone gets this paperback, it'll be Superman completists. People looking for a good Superman story -- get the original Death &amp; Return saga... I'm afraid you won't find it here.	2003-12-04

That said, this book, \\"How the Wizard Came to Oz,\\" is a nice enough entry but doesn't feel all that necessary.<br />The book tells, as the title implies, the story of how Oscar Zoroaster went from being a carnival man in America to the Great and Terrible Wizard of Oz. It tells of his early encounters with the Wicked Witches of both the East and the West, how people in the Emerald City came to wear green spectacles and fills in a lot of other gaps in the first book.<br />But some of the things Abbott delves into in this book feel kind of superfluous. Cameos by all three of Dorothy's original companions -- the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Woodman -- add nothing to the story and seem to be pure padding. Other things, like a quick joke referring to the classic MGM film, just distract you from Baum's Oz and jerk you out into the real world where you've seen Judy Garland deliver this joke a thousand times in a thousand re-watchings of the movie.<br />It's a decent book if you're an Ozophile and want to get everything worth getting, but for the casual reader, if you take a pass you'll have nothing to regret.	2003-12-01

Frank Baum's brillian Oz series, I'm afraid I've got to mark this book down as just a so-so entry. It probably would have appealed to me more were it not for the grossly misleading title, \\"The Scarecrow of Oz.\\" The titular character doesn't appear until about page 150 of a 260-page book, for starters, and while he certainly plays an important part in the events that follow, the book is not really about him at all. Instead it's the story of Trot and Cap'n Bill, two of Baum's non-Oz characters, being swept away to the land of Oz for the first time. For much of the book the story follows the formula of the most lackluster Oz books -- characters get lost in a magical fairy land and meet lots of strange and interesting creatures -- but it picks up when they enter Jinxland and are forced to face down King Krewl.<br />The plus for this book would be that I'm now more inclined to go back and read the two Trot and Cap'n Bill books that preceded this one. I do admire the way Baum laced his various characters together into a cohesive universe of his own, even if he was practically forced to by the demands of his young readers. I just wish he'd found a way to express what this book was really about a little better.	2003-11-26

It's not essential reading for people who are fans of the movies but just want to know what's going on, but most of the stories in this book are clever and inventive in their own right.<br />Ted McKeever's entry may be the best in the book -- the story of a woman who, when given a choice between a blue pill and a red pill, chose the blue. The Wachowskis chime in with their own story, about the robot B1-66ER, whose murder of its owner sparked the first war between humans and machines -- this story in particular tied in with The Animatrix. Neil Gaiman, one of the best writers on the planet these days, did a short story with a couple of illustrations rather than a comic book story. His tale, about a man forced to live several lives in the Matrix, plays with the nature of time the way the films play with the nature of reality. It's one of the standouts.<br />A couple of the stories are just so-so -- John Van Fleet and Bill Sienkiwicz, I'm afraid, didn't add too much to the world of the Matrix, but the rest of the stories are fantastic. Recommended for anyone who wants to delve deeper into this still-fascinating world.	2003-11-17

Rediscovering them now, as an adult, I find it still delights me more than most.<br />The plot, I must admit, is quite reminiscent of \\"Ozma of Oz\\" -- a girl and a mortal animal wash up on the shores of some fairyland, encounter the man Tik-Tok and find themselves trapped in a battle with the king of the Nomes. It has been said,in fact, that the plot of this novel came when Baum converted \\"Ozma\\" into a stage play, then converted the stage play back into a novel.<br />However, the book itself is still quite delightful. We don't meet too many really interesting new characters in this book -- not as many as most Oz books, in fact -- but it no longer follows the tired \\"someone tries to get to the Emerald City and meets interesting creatures along the way\\" formula that began in the very first book and crippled several books after \\"Ozma.\\"<br />Tititi-Hoochoo and Quox the Dragon stand out as the new characters, and it is the sequences featuring them that I find most entertaining. Kaliko and Ruggedo in the Nome Kingdom again draw a grin from me, and the final few pages have a laugh-out loud moment that must have come when someone pointed out an inconsistency in the Oz books that Baum had to suddenly explain away.<br />\\"Tik-Tok of Oz\\" may not be the best of the Oz books, but it's probably the funniest, and it's certainly one of my favorites.	2003-11-14

He has managed to take Characters that could have easily been stupid and cliched and turned them into real people with real emotions and problems that any of us can relate to. Even the goofiest character in the book, Igor, is shown to have uncommon courage and compassion when called for, and an unwavering loyalty to his friends that some of us are never even lucky enough to find in the real world.<br />This volume, like \\"Livin' La Vida Dorka\\" (volume 4) takes a break from the regular Dork Tower storyline to present \\"Understanding Gamers,\\" the brilliant one-issue special where Kovalic explained the mindset of those who live to game. It connects to even a non-gaming reader and shows that gamers aren't quite the freaks they get portrayed as, especially in comparison to even some \\"normal\\" folks. The rest of the book is full of other strips and specials, some that even a regular visitor of Kovalic's website such as myself may not have seen before.<br />There is a little duplication from previous volumes with some of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" strips, but as Kovalic himself explains, that's because he reprinted the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Dork Tower special in its entirety here in this volume.<br />You don't need to have read the previous Dork Tower volumes to read this one, but you're cheating yourself if you don't. This is one of the funniest comic books on the stands today.	2003-11-11
US	41980939	RIGSICGARHFM0	0553290991	166385709	Nightfall	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A solid work of science fiction	This book reads like a much older story than it really is, first seeing publication in 1990, just a few years before Asimov's death. Perhaps that's because it is based on a much older short story of Asimov's, perhaps that's because his collaborator, Robert Silverberg, really managed to capture the Master's old-fashioned writing style. No matter -- none of this should be construed as a criticism of the book -- no, instead, take it as praise.<br />The lonely planet Kalgash roams the heavens in orbit around six suns, resulting in the odd situation of perpetual daylight all over the globe. No one on Kalgash has ever seen nightfall, even has any concept of what \\"night\\" is, and darkness, one of the most primal fears of even our own half-and-half world, is enough to drive a person mad if exposed to it for too long.<br />Slowly, groups of scientists across Kalgash begin to conclude, through evidence both anthropological, mathematical and astronomical, that Kalgash has a satellite of its own that it never sees, and that satellite lines up just properly with the suns every 2049 years to create a total eclipse, plunging the planet into darkness for hours. The cataclysm will most certainly be enough to drive everyone mad, and the world as they know it will end.<br />The book is kind of hard to classify -- not a thriller, not a mystery, not really hard science fiction and not completely a post-apocalyptic tale, but it's still very good. Silverberg assimilates Asimov's style well and you can't tell that you're reading the work of two separate authors, which to me is the mark of a successful collaboration.<br />The book does get a bit tiresome at points as characters begin to \\"hypothetically\\" debate how life would evolve on some impossible world that was in darkness a whole half of its day, but those segments fortunately never last very long and don't detract too much from the story itself.<br />All in all, a good, solid sci-fi tale that Asimov readers will most certainly enjoy.	2003-11-10

Kia Asamiya, I understand, is a superstar in Japan, but his style simply does not fit the X-Men. Characters are blocky, noses are pointy and costumes are simply ugly. Archangel goes through a transformation and gains a new \\"power\\" that makes absolutely no sense in the context of the character and his sudden, inexplicable attraction to Husk is just weird. That's another of Austen's weaknesses on this title -- every female character seems to serve no other purpose than to pine over one of the male characters.<br />And the mutant \\"werewolves\\"? Seen it before. Call me back when a new writer starts bringing this series back up again.	2003-11-07

Frank Baum's \\"Oz\\" series (\\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\", \\"The Road to Oz\\" and \\"The Emerald City of Oz\\") were all rather lackluster, this book was a return to form. The problem with the other installments was a lack of a new story -- they were all about people who went to Oz, met lots of strange and interesting people, and had a happy ending.<br />\\"The Patchwork Girl of Oz,\\" however, had a very good story to bolster the old Oz formula. Ojo the Unlucky, a young Munchkin lad, along with the Glass Cat and Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, set out to find magical ingredients needed to restore his uncle and a magician's wife to life after they are accidentally petrified. So the story is, again, about someone wandering Oz and meeting strange and interesting people, but giving Ojo a quest gave the book a different angle, a sense of urgency -- this was a boy on a mission to save two lives.<br />The ending is somewhat abrupt, although quite in-character for Baum's creations, but overall it is one of the better Oz books, a real return to form after a few that just didn't click.	2003-11-05

Books	3	3	7	N	Y	Cute, if not deep	I have reached a point, as a reader, where I will devour virtually anything by Neil Gaiman, and when I heard he was part of this anthology of \\"silly\\" tales, I had to pick it up. It was a nice added bonus to find a comic book story by Lemony Snicket and a classic by Basil Wolverton among the offerings in this volume.<br />Most of the other entries, I'm afraid, I found just to be okay. One or two were even a tad boring -- but keep in mind, this is from the perspective of an adult reader. I have a great appreciation for children's stories, but I tend towards the ones that are layered in such a fashion that adults can appreciate them as well. Most of the stories in this book aren't. Kids will probably love it, though.<br />The puzzles are fun and a nice inclusion, and the front and back art pieces by the creator of \\"Where's Waldo\\" were a riot. If you're a big-time Gaiman fan like me and just have to get anything he does, you can probably justify getting this book. If you've got kids, you don't need to justify it -- it's well worth it.	2003-10-30

Chuck Austen, although he has shown some talent on books like \\"Superman: Metropolis,\\" is totally wrong for this series. Iceman and Polaris are written entirely out of character, Havok's relationship with \\"Nurse Annie,\\" which bordered on the necrophilic to begin with, just went into plain goofy at this point, and Austen went to great lengths to essentially cut out the heart of Nightcrawler, one of the few characters in comics to devoutly express any religious faith whatsoever.

Fortunately, what is was is a book I liked quite a bit. More familiar with Martin as an actor and screenwriter, particularly the goofy brand of humor he is so well known for, I was unprepared for this quiet little book that is really more of a study of four characters than anything else. Mirabelle, Ray, Jeremy and Lisa each are examined from all angles, all flaws and facets of their characters exposed, and we see precicely how each of them has changed by the end of the story. There are funny parts, but nothing really laugh-out loud funny. It's more of a quiet story, a story to think about.<br />Like I said, not what I expected at all.<br />But still, quite good.	2003-10-20

What if he escaped and began spreading vampirism as a plague across the world? This is the germ of Newman's brilliant \\"Anno Dracula\\" series, which blends not only Bram Stoker's work, but also the work of H.G. Welles, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Ian Fleming, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, Joss Whedon and even a dash of Charles Schulz (if you look closely enough) in a generational epic that tells the tale of this new, Nosferatu-infected universe.<br />This first book in the series focuses on the years following Bram Stoker's tale, as the vampires have risen to prominence but have not yet been touched by the 20th century. The whole thing is blended seamlessly with events both real and fictional, including the Jack the Ripper case, and the whole package comes together quite nicely.	2003-10-13

Pratchett, as always, is brilliantly funny and biting with his satire. No target is safe. As the title of the book implies, Pratchett's motto seems to be \\"carpe jugulum... go for the throat.\\"<br />I must admit, as far as the series-within-a-series Discworld books go, it took time for me to warm up to Granny Weatherwax. She and her coven have become some of my favorites among Pratchett's creations, though, and this book was perhaps their best outing yet.	2003-10-13

Jim Shooter, still the whiz-kid writer he was before he became a legendary editor, led the Legion down paths of intelligence and daring that were only beginning to be touched on over at Marvel Comics at the time (the early 1960s). This volume introduces the Fatal Five, villains that still plague the Legion to this day, and featured the death of a Legionnaire that became truly iconic. This was the first time I had read these stories, and while I knew the story of the Legionnaire and how he died (it's referenced so often in the years afterwards) I never realized how briefly, relatively speaking, he was a member of the Legion before his death. It's startling that a character who was around for such a short period of time became such a martyr among the Legionnaires. And it's a remarkable story. Halfway through the Legion Archives (so far -- there are 12 volumes in print as of this writing), this is by far the best of the series yet.	2003-10-08

Picking up from the cliffhanger of \\"The Carnivorous Carnival,\\" the story opens with Klaus and Violet Baudelaire separated from their youngest sibling, Sunny. Their efforts to rescue her from the clutches of the evil Count Olaf make up the bulk of the book, but the writer mixes in his usual stew of subtle clues, blatant clues, false clues and major twists until the book ends with yet another cliffhanger. It's frustrating, to be sure, knowing we'll have to wait for \\"The Grim Graveyard,\\" but it is a far cry better than some of the earlier, repetitive books like \\"The Reptile Room.\\"<br />To his credit, the writer is redeeming some of the poorer installments of the series by bringing in elements from those books and making them important now. Furthermore, he develops his young characters quite a bit, with Violet clearly becoming more of a young woman and Sunny becoming less of a baby. Unfortunately, he does not escape the trap of his poorly-drawn adult characters. As usual, they're all either evil or fools, with seemingly nothing in-between. Hopefully that will change if and when we finally meet the Volunteers... wherever they are.	2003-09-29

It's been a few years, between &quot;The Atomics,&quot; &quot;X-Force&quot; and &quot;X-Statix,&quot; since we've seen Mike Allred's Madman in a solo adventure, but this book really satisfied me, even if it did make me long for a more regular Madman fix.<br />Frank &quot;Madman&quot; Einstein is looking forward to a quiet date with his girlfriend, Joe, until she's abducted by a strange Fish Man (classic for a Madman villain). The resulting search and battle is the sort of fun action and existential mayhem we've come to expect from Allred.<br />The three back-up stories in this volume are all by other writer/artists. They each have their good points, but my favorite is Daniel Krall's &quot;Speaking Frankly,&quot; where a bunch of teenagers give their own views of the Madman of Snap City.<br />This is a dandy little book. If only there were more in the works for the near future... uh, I'll be aching for a Madman fix now.	2003-09-06

Don't misunderstand; \\"Death: At Death's Door\\" is clever, funny and beautifully drawn. The \\"1\\" on the spine seems to indicate there are more books in this series intended, and I for one will get each and every one of them, because if anyone is qualified to continue the tales of the Endless with Neil Gaiman gone, it's Jill Thompson.<br />The only flaw, the thing that may keep this from being 100 percent accessible to new audiences, comes in the form of the story Thompson has chosen to tell. This story is, in essence, a sidebar to \\"Sandman: A Season of Mists,\\" and because of that, feels kind of clunky. The scenes that directly parallel the earlier volume don't quite fit in tone with the rest of the book (although Thompson does make an admirable effort at showing some of the behind-the-scenes shenanigans we didn't get to see when we read the story from Dream's perspective). If you haven't read ASOM, chances are this book will be more than a little confusing... like you're reading just the subplot of a much larger work.<br />Still, Thompson's art style is great and her writing is sharp and funny. The idea of Edgar Allen Poe falling in love with Despair had me rolling. I hope in the future she is allowed to let loose and tell more stories completely on her own instead of relying on a preexisting Gaiman story as her hook.	2003-09-03

It's been a long time since I read anything by Michael Crichton, but I remembered liking the stuff I had read. When I recently saw the trailer for the upcoming \\"Timeline\\" movie I thought, \\"Hey, that doesn't look bad... I better read the book first, though.\\"<br />The book was a well-told, if somewhat conventional time travel story. A group of historians and students are sent back in time to rescue their professor, who went back on an earlier trip and somehow was lost. Crichton obviously put a lot of research into the customs, traditions and language of the era he writes about, and it shows through in a pretty good action story.<br />The first hundred pages or so kind of drag, though, and the explanation for time travel STILL gives me a headache. \\"So wait... if they're really travelling through alternate universes how did they end up in the 1400s? How did the professor leave the message? Where did... ARGH!\\" Eventually I gave up on understanding it and just accepted it the way I accepted that a kid bit by a genetically-altered spider would get superpowers or that a scientist who caught a dose of gamma radiation could turn big and green instead of get cancer and die. After that, I enjoyed the book a lot better. Suspend your disbelief for this one and you'll do fine.	2003-08-13

I've never been the biggest fan of Bart Sears' artwork, and at times it becomes quite difficult to tell the characters apart. The pacing is a bit slow, which usually doesn't bother me, but doesn't suit this book as much as it wants to.<br />The big problem with this collection, though, is that \\"The Path\\" is done entirely in double-page spreads. Instead of reading each left-hand page then each right-hand page, like in most comics, the two pages combine. This is fine in a magazine style comic book, but when the pages are reproduced into a paperback edition like this, the middle of each image get trapped in the crease and makes it difficult to read.<br />It's not a bad book, and it deservedly has its fans. I'm just not one of them.	2003-07-31

Harris takes the classic vampire mythos and puts a clever spin on it, \\"outing\\" the creatures of the night to the world at large. Seeing a vampire in Harris' world is like encountering a member of any other minority group -- which makes for some interesting paralells in how anti-vampiric sentiments echo racism. The trouble is, sometimes the anti-vampirism is justified -- there are good vampires, yes, but there are still just as many who see humans as cattle. Achieving the balance between the different temperaments of the undead is not easy, but Harris handles it well.<br />Sookie Stackhouse, our improbably named heroine, is a great viewpoint character, although her \\"disability\\" seems a bit convenient. I hope that future volumes in the series delve into it a bit further, possibly putting forth an explanation of where her power comes from.<br />Of course, the fact that I'm contemplating future volumes is the best praise I can give this book. I enjoyed it enough to keep reading. Looking forward to book 2.	2003-07-31

Mark Waid gets it.<br />When he dies, that should be on his tombstone: \\"Mark Waid gets it.\\" After years of trying to shoehorn the Fantastic Four into superheroic adventures and bloated cosmic storylines, Marvel comics finally gave the reigns of their premiere title to a writer who understands who these characters are: not superheroes, explorers. Adventurers. Scientists. Reed DOES have a heart, Sue DOES have a brain, Johnny IS a young man and Ben IS gruffer than he is often portrayed.<br />They're a family.<br />This volume collects the first several issues of Waid's run, including both the \\"Sentient\\" storyline and the \\"Small Stuff...Big Stuff\\" story. The artwork by Mike Wieringo and Mark Buckingham is all beautiful, showing off how good Waid's script is.<br />The book also contains two bonuses -- Waid's \\"Manifesto\\" on the Fantastic Four, which is a very entertaining read and can be summed up in three words: \\"HE GETS IT\\" -- and Karl Kesel and Stuart Immonen's story about the Thing exploring his own past, confirming for the first time (to my knowledge) that Ben Grimm is Jewish. Until Waid took over, the Kesel/Immonen story was the best issue of FF in years.<br />If you've ever loved the Fantastic Four, you've got to read this book. They're great again.<br />For now, anyway. Waid is leaving the book far, far too soon. But while he's there, it is once again a serious contender for the title \\"World's Greatest Comics Magazine.\\"	2003-07-31

I was really excited when I heard about this book -- MST3K was one of my favorite TV shows of all time, and there's no pasttime I enjoy more than the skewering of bad movies. This book wasn't what I thought it would be, though -- a clever, insightful ribbing of lousy movies. It was much more mean-spirited than even your average MST3K episode, and a great deal of the criticism Nelson offered was of the \\"I'm too good for this movie variety,\\" which as far as I'm concerned, is NEVER valid criticism. He kept returning to the same comments over and over again... I swear, if he'd called someone \\"doughy\\" one more time I may have hurled the book through the window. And a lot of the personal attacks felt wholly unnecessary. I dunno. I guess without the filter of two brilliant robots, I just don't find Mike Nelson all that funny.	2003-06-30

Their two Batman volumes, The Long Halloween and Dark Victory, are mystery masterworks. Superman For All Seasons was so good that Loeb got hired to write for the Smallville TV show.<br />Their work for Marvel hasnt been as eye-popping, though. Daredevil: Yellow was pretty good, but for the most part, Spider-Man: Blue left me pretty stale, and I think I know why. Gwen Stacy.<br />So many of todays comic pros grew up in the days when Gwen Stacy was the it girl, Spider-Mans girlfriend, the woman he was meant to be with. Then, in a stunning act for comics of the 1970s, she was killed off. As those readers became the creators, a wave of Gwen nostalgia was kicked into high gear.<br />Problem is, Im a child of the 80s, by which time there was a new it girl, Mary Jane Watson. She was the love of Spider-Mans life. She was the woman he wound up marrying. But over and over again, the writers at Marvel seem to keep churning out these long, aching love letters to Gwen Stacy. I can appreciate her place as a character and as an important chapter in Spider-Mans history, but shes not a character Ive ever really felt for.<br />Out of all these love letters, Spider-Man: Blue is probably the best done. Its written well and Sales artwork, as always, is beautiful. Any one of the covers in this series has poster potential. But for all that, its just not for me. Gwen Stacy fans, this one is for you. As for the rest of us, Im waiting for the days when Spidey fans who grew up with Mary Jane start writing the stories.	2003-06-26

That's how long it was between the time I found the Amazon package this morning, as though left by an owl, and the time I turned the last page in this incredible book. If you've read the first four Harry Potter books, I don't need to sell you on this. If you're just looking for a little more info before you order, consider this:<br />There is more action and surprise in just the first three chapters of this book than in the first three books in this series combined.<br />By the end you're left feeling that you know more than ever before, but that there are still mysteries to be solved.<br />Incidental characters become increasingly important, with one in particular earning a degree of honor and respect you'd never have imagined.<br />It's almost impossible to discuss this book, because I would never want to ruin even a bit of it for someone who hasn't read it yet. It's clear why this book took three years to write. There's so much going on, so much meat... snippets of humor dovetailing into pure terror, high fantasy mixed with in-depth social structure, characters rising to become heroes and others falling to darkness or ignorance. This is a book that will require multiple readings to take it all in. Which is fortunate, because it may be some time before we discover what lies next. Your heart will, in turns, soar, break and be filled with resolve.<br />I can't even fathom what comes next.	2003-06-22

When DC Comics debuted its Vertigo line in 1993, the idea was to make comics for  adults. Now one of the best comics in the line, \\"The Books of Magic,\\" is being translated into a series of prose novels for young readers. That just strikes me as funky somehow.<br />Jablonski does a good job of taking Gaiman's original comic book and distilling it to a novel. She strips the most overt elements of the DC universe (while Zatanna, Constantine and the Phantom Stranger are all DCU characters they aren't nearly as well-known or iconic as the likes of Superman, who made a cameo in the comic but was wisely left out of the novel). I'm curious as to whether this series is intended to follow Tim as far as the comics did, to his later teenage years in the \\"Hunter: The Age of Magic\\" series.<br />Unfortunately, no matter how good this series is, it'll probably be overlooked as a Harry Potter clone, even though Tim and Yo-yo predate Harry and Hedwig by at least six years by my count. If you dig Harry Potter, give the Books of Magic a fair shot.	2003-05-29

I got this book less for the story than for the format. CrossGen comics is experimenting with a smaller-size graphic novel called a \\"Traveler,\\" and I wanted to see if it was any good.<br />The story was pretty good too, thankfully. I haven't read any of Salvatore's \\"DemonWars\\" prose novels, but the graphic novel Scott Ciencin set in Salvatore's universe was good enough to get me interested. It doesn't seem like anything groundbreaking in fantasy -- a mysterious ranger, assorted colorful characters, bad monsters to slay -- but it's a solid story and the characters are intriguing, and if I've got that much, I can deal with a standard fantasy setting.<br />I also appreciated the short story \\"Three Ships\\" that Salvatore contributed to this volume. It's an early story of Grave Mungo, a dwarven character I understand hasn't appeared in the novels but was created for this comic. The purpose of the red caps the dwarves wear struck me as being particularly clever.<br />On to why I bought the book -- the format. Spectacular! CrossGen has found a way to shrink comic book artwork and lettering to a size only slightly larger than a normal mass market trade paperback without degrading the quality one iota! Plus, it's cheaper than a regular trade paperback and it takes up less shelf space. I'd be happy if all graphic novels came out in Traveler format from now on!	2003-05-13

John Kovalics Dork Tower series, since I discovered it a few years ago, has been one of the best treats Ive enjoyed as a comic book reader. Its the story of Matt, Igor, Ken and Carson -- four average gaming geeks (average except that Carson happens to be a muskrat) who walk a balance between existing in the real world and escaping to a game world.<br />This volume, third in the series, offers some of the best plot advancement yet. For some time now Kovalic has danced around the fact that Matt and Gilly the Perky Goth would be kindred spirits if they ever actually met. In this book, he finally gives us that meeting -- with a monkeywrench thrown in. Matt meets Gilly, all right... right after he gets back together with his game-hating, geek-intolerant ex-girlfriend.<br />Dork Tower is one of the few series that really makes you feel for the characters without ever resorting to sappy moments or losing the fact that its a comedy first. We want Matt and Gilly to get together, but the obstacles in their way are so funny we dont want them to stop. Every page of this book is packed with laughs. I cant imagine anyone not loving this book. I've said it before and I'll say it again -- if Charles Schulz had played \\"Dungeons and Dragons,\\" the result would have been \\"Dork Tower.\\"	2003-05-13

They delve into the meanings of the names of the characters and places, advancing the theory that nothing in these books is named capriciously, and even spend a little time in wild speculation about what may lay in book 5 and beyond.<br />The writing style feels a little too cutesy at times -- with the proliferation of smiley faces I got the feeling that I was reading one giant transcript of a fan website... which, now that I think about it, I probably was. And some of the theories go so completely wild that youre left chuckling at them, certain that theyre reading WAY too much into certain details.

Fortunately, Bill Amend's \\"FoxTrot\\" has long been in my top-five list -- it's just being moved to the head of the line.<br />\\"FoxTrot\\" is one of the few strips left that can be funny without being syrupy, hasn't been rehashing the same old jokes for decades and doesn't politicize to such an extent that you wish it would be moved to the editorial page. In five main characters, Amend has an almost infinite number of story possibilities -- the health nut mom, the doofus dad, sports-crazed Peter, boy-crazed Paige and the frightening boy genius Jason.<br />Jason is easily my favorite character, and I suspect Amend created him as an outlet for his own inner geek. Strips like Jason's preparations for the new \\"Star Trek\\" movie or the one where he demands a refund for a comic book due to a piddling continuity error are the sort of things that only a real Trekker or comic reader could draw with such affection.<br />I've got all but two of the FoxTrot anthologies and I plan to own them all in short order -- but this is my favorite because the strips in here chronicle the period where my local newspaper started to carry it. These are the strips that first introduced me to the Fox family. I still look for them every morning.	2003-04-14

I was familiar with some of Sachar's other work -- the old \\"Wayside School\\" books, for instance -- and I expected this book to be along the same lines in terms of tone and comedy.<br />I was completely blown away.<br />This wasn't the silly, happy Sachar of the \\"Wayside\\" books or the afterschool special feel of \\"There's a Boy in the Girl's Bathroom.\\" This was something different -- funny, but dark, menacing but inspiring. This is one of those books that makes a writer think, \\"wow... so THAT'S how you do it.\\"<br />I won't go into the plot, since there are about 2000 other reviews you can look at for that, I'll just tell you what's good about it. The story is tight -- I read the whole book in three hours. There is nothing extra, no fat, no padding. Everything comes together perfectly. The characters are real -- the boys at the prison camp aren't hardened monsters, but they aren't innocent waifs either. These are kids who are at Green Lake because they have done bad things and, even if they're likeable, they're capable of doing bad things again.<br />Stanley, our hero, is unlucky, but not broken. He's got guts and smarts, and  with those attributes together he accomplishes great things.<br />It's really great to see an award-winning book that DESERVES it.	2003-04-09

I couldn't tell if I liked the book or not. It was funny, it was well-written, but it was so hard to sympathize with such a wretched main character, even as David made you WANT him to redeem himself.<br />This sequel left me feeling much the same way. We start out with a very funny \\"Lord of the Rings\\" parody, but it doesn't really serve any purpose in the story other than to alienate Apropos from Sharee, the weaver who is his sidekick, unless he's her sidekick. The two of them wind up in a series of adventures, both together and apart, that leave you feeling that Apropos still has hope for redemption even while you're very disturbed at what he has wrought.<br />I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun reading it. But again, at the end, I can't decide if I liked it or not. I suspect the third book, which I most certainly will read, will leave me feeling the same way.<br />By the way -- the \\"revelation\\" in the last paragraph of the book? Saw it coming a mile away. It's a classic David twist.	2003-04-03

When I reviewed \\"The Carnivorous Carnival,\\" I said that reading the Series of Unfortunate Events was \\"like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle with only a few of the pieces, having no idea how many pieces there are supposed to be and without the picture on the cover of the box because your brother lost it. And I mean this as a compliment.\\"<br />Well, reading this book is like having an extra box of puzzle pieces dumped in the middle of what you've already got put together. In 13 chapters, Snicket gives us teases, tidbits and (probably) outright lies about his past and how he is connected to Count Olaf and the Baudelaires. Every page of this book is important, even the index, which reveals more clues if you follow the links. Daniel Handler (the man behind the story) has worked so hard to construct this that he's even got clues hidden in OTHER people's books! (Unless, of course, he's really Beverly Cleary, too.)<br />Armed with the new hints I got from this one (particularly the Sebald Code) I'm tempted to go back and re-read the entire series from book one. And why not? I've got time -- who knows when book ten is going to come out?	2003-04-01

Frank Baum had enough, and tried to close off the series with this sixth installment. Of course, the children wouldn't let him, and he went on to write eight more, but this effort to end the series was one of the best in some time.<br />The last two books (\\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\" and \\"The Road to Oz\\") suffered serious problems. They meandered, there was no sense of danger, nothing bad could ever happen to these characters. This time out Baum started with our heroine in a form of danger -- Aunt Em and Uncle Henry were going to lose the farm in Kansas -- and went on to reestablish the greatest threat the Oz books had left, Roquat the Red, the Nome King.<br />While this book again lacked a serious sense of danger, the devices Baum used in his effort to end the series were all clever, and furthermore, made for better stories when he returned to the series later. This is a lovely story, a real classic.	2003-04-01

And I mean this as a compliment. Nine books down and we still have far more questions than answers. Each time we get a puzzle piece, instead of making things clearer, we just wind up getting more confused about how it's supposed to fit in.<br />It's hard to discuss the plot of this book without spoiling the previous eight, so if you haven't read those other ones, go read `em now. This time out the Baudelaire orphans are forced to disguise themselves as freaks in the Caligari Carnival (love references like that), desperate to hunt down a the truth about their parents, Count Olaf, Jaques Snicket and V.F.D.<br />By the end of the book they have no more truths than they began with, but they do have a place to look next, assuming they get out of what has to be one of the best cliffhanger endings I've ever seen in a kid's book.

A month ago (as of this writing) I'd never ever heard of this series, but now I'm eagerly awaiting the next volume. George R.R. Martin has assembled some fantastic writers to concoct an entire universe of \\"Wild Card\\" superheroes that parallels our own world even moreso than the worlds of Marvel and DC Comics which serve as much of the inspiration.<br />Here's the concept -- in the days after World War II a bomb went off in the skies above New York City, blanketing the people in a virus. Most of them died. Some, the \\"jokers\\" underwent a terrible transformation. A select few drew \\"aces\\" -- superpowers without a deformity.<br />Each writer in this collection (an intriguing device martin calls a \\"Mosaic Novel\\") tells the story of an ace or joker of his or her creation. All of the stories stand on their own, although many feel very much like a chapter in a longer tale (John J. Miller's \\"Comes the Hunter\\" especially) and I hope these threads are picked up in the later books.<br />As with any collection of diverse writers, some stories are better than others. Martin's own \\"Shell Games\\" is my favorite in this volume -- I could have done without the sewer tale, \\"Down Deep.\\" Even with that lesser story, the concept and execution is wonderful -- I for one am hoping Martin deals out a few more Wild Cards in the future.	2003-03-27

Oh, it was a passable action-fantasy, but it didn't engage me enough to justify spending three bucks a month for the comic book. Still, I kept hearing people say how good it was, and I started to wonder if I'd missed something, so when this collection of the first six issues was published, I decided to give it another try.<br />I'm glad I did.<br />\\"Way of the Rat\\" is a fast-paced martial arts action flick on paper. Our hero is a thief who happens upon a pair of mystic artifacts -- a scroll and a ring, the latter of which transforms him into a fighting master whenever he lifts a staff. With the help of a spiritual guide in the form of a talking monkey, the \\"Jade Rat\\" learns he has a much greater destiny than that of a criminal and embarks upon a quest to become a hero.<br />Reading this collection, I realized quickly why I didn't care for it in single-issue form. It's fast paced. SO fast-paced, in fact, that in that first issue I never got a chance to feel for or care about any of the characters. Reading six chapters in one go cured me of that. \\"Way of the Rat\\" is going to join CrossGen's \\"Mystic\\" as a comic book I prefer to get in trade paperbacks instead of magazine form.	2003-03-24

This is the book that has really made it worth wading through some of the earlier, poorer installment in the Series of Unfortunate Events. The backstory is developing, large parts of the formula have been dropped and, for the first time, we're seeing the evidence of behind-the-scenes planning that stretches back to the first book, making the intervening installments worthwhile.<br />Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are on the run. (First break from the formula -- they aren't handed over to a new guardian by the ineffective Mr. Poe in this one.) They are wanted for murder and the man they stand accused of killing, Count Olaf, is hot on their tails. They take refuge in the Heimlich Hospital, hoping to use its Library of Records to learn the truth about the fire that destroyed their family, the poor, mysterious Jacques Snicket and the plaguing initials V.F.D. They don't find any answers in this book, I'll spare your senses that much, but they find some of the most intriguing questions yet put to the page and the ending takes you totally off-guard for once.<br />Now I'm upset that there's only one book left in this series that's been published so far.

Michael Straczynski's rising stars)	Books	2	3	9	N	N	Stick with the graphic novel	When I saw this book, I thought perhaps this was an original novel set in Straczynski's \\"Rising Stars\\" universe, not unlike the \\"Bright\\" miniseries Fiona Avery is writing. I was surprised when I realized it was, in fact, a novelization of the first \\"Rising Stars\\" story arc, but I decided to give it a try. Comic novelizations aren't that common, but they can be done well, as Greg Rucka's \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" and Elliot S. Maggin's \\"Kingdom Come\\" can both attest.<br />I wish I'd let those works stand alone as my examples of this art form, because both as a novel and as a novelization, this falls very flat.<br />The book is, in many parts, a scene-for-scene retelling of the comic book, which is not what you want in a novelization to begin with. There's nothing new here, nothing to enhance the story, nothing to make you feel like you've read something you haven't read before. Furthermore, segments that worked in the comic don't always work in the novel -- the chapter with a one of the Specials describing her life to a mundane over dinner was fantastic in the comic book, but tedious and unnecessary in the novel.<br />The way it is constructed is very poor as well -- the decision to write this book from John \\"Poet\\" Simon's first-person narration is a terrible one. The author keeps lapsing into interior thoughts of characters that the narrator couldn't possibly know, showing scenes that he wasn't present for and could never have assembled this much information on -- and it gets worse when he tries to pass it off. At one point he tells us (after the fact) that the narrator later viewed the scene on a surveillance tape, at another point we're reading another character's (immaculately detailed) diary. At one particularly frustrating point, the author just admits he's writing pure speculation -- \\"And Lee probably said something like...\\" It was really weak and really distracting.<br />I can't quite figure out who the target audience for this book is. It can't be fans of the comic book, because the comic book is far too good and this book adds nothing to it. I can't be people who haven't read the comic, because it isn't written in a fashion that will entice any of them.

The Series of Unfortunate Events, for me, has been a series with serious ups and downs. The first book was good, but two and three seriously meandered and nothing seemed to happen. Four was a little better, and five shook up the status quo quite a bit. Six was different, but kept raising questions without answering them. With this book, book seven, we're still left with more questions than answers, but the status quo is SERIOUSLY shaken up in a way this series really needed, and I'm excited all over again.<br />The Baudelaire orphans -- Klaus, Sunny and Violet, are shipped off again, not to a relative this time, but to to a village with all-too-familiar initials, full of people that will supposedly work together to raise the children. As is always the case in this series, the adults are all either cruel, stupid or wimps -- the children are forced into servitude while being cared for by the kindly handyman Hector, who is nice enough but who does not have the backbone to stand up for the children (much like Jerome in the previous book).<br />Throughout the book the children are trying to solve the big mysteries of this series -- what is VFD? What happened to the Quagmire triplets? And what is the mysterious link between the author and the nefarious Count Olaf?<br />None of these questions are answered definitively, although clues and hints are included for all three -- but what really charges this book up is the ending, which I can honestly say ends (at least in one respect) in a fashion hitherto unseen in this series and which makes you suddenly sit up and take notice. \\"Hostile Hospital\\" here I come...	2003-03-17

With all due respect to the great work Geoff Johns is currently doing with the Flash, Mark Waid was the writer who really defined the character for me and remains my favorite. This is the storyline that first made me take notice.<br />Published in the midst of the \\"Kill/revamp/screw around with your hero\\" craze that started with the Death of Superman, when Barry Allen showed up in the Flash comic book, a lot of us didn't know what to make of it. Barry, alias Flash II, had died the ultimate heroic death in \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" and had become the Official Martyr of the DC Universe. His nephew, Wally West, took on the Flash mantle but had always struggled, trapped under Barry's shadow.<br />The best way to sum up this story is with the old chestnut, \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\" When Barry returns, it seems like the greatest thing that could happen. As it turns out, this isn't the case. The twist doesn't come as too big a surprise to anyone familiar with Flash history, but this story wasn't really about the twist -- it was about the legacy of the Flash, one of Earth's heroes, created by Jay Garrick and immortalized by Barry Allen, and it was about the efforts of the heir to that legacy to rise to the challenge and become not only a hero, but a man. It's a marvelous, touching story, and it's something every Flash fan should read.	2003-03-07

Character development? Backstory? In the Series of Unfortunate Events?<br />After being disappointed in the second and third installments in this series and only partially impressed with book four, this fifth volume came as quite a welcome surprise. The woes of the Baudelaire orphans continue as they are shipped off to Prufrock Academy, a miserable school with an egocentric violinist for a vice principal, foolish teachers, crabs, mold and the metric system. There is only one bright spot for the Baudelaires -- for the first time in this series, they encounter some genuine friends in the Quagmire triplets, Duncan and Isadora (the third triplet, sadly, perished in the fire that killed the Quagmire parents. Fire seems to be the tool of choice for creating orphans in the world of Lemony Snicket).<br />The Quagmires are the first characters we've met since the Baudelaires in book one that aren't ignorant, evil or both, and having them around seems to help the heroes grow a bit as characters. Even the infant Sunny begins to periodically use the proper English word on occasion instead of the gibberish that Snicket usually takes a bizarre delight in defining.<br />Speaking of Snicket, he teases us with a snippet about his own past and the relationship of his mysterious, beloved Beatrice to the nefarious Count Olaf, the architect of the Baudelaire's woes. That little hint of backstory was enough to really ignite my interest again.<br />So for those of you getting tired with the series after downright boring installments like \\"The Wide Window,\\" I sympathize with you, but stick it out! It does get better!	2003-03-03

Ever since DC Comics jumpstarted its entire line with 1986's classic \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths,\\" some people have been confused as to which elements of the pre-Crisis universe survived the transition. This book collects a two-part series DC published soon after \\"Crisis\\" that explains that in full.<br />With text by Marv Wolfman and artwork by George Perez (the same team that brought you \\"Crisis,\\") this book outlines the entire timeline of the DCU as it existed in the wake of the Crisis. It explains and clarifies the history of the single universe that remained following the implosion, and while some of the elements touched upon in here have changed in the 17 years since its original publication (the Legion of Super-Heroes in particular stands out, since they were jumpstarted on their own in 1994's \\"Zero Hour\\"), the book is still clear and concise enough that the casual comic reader can use it as a primer to reconcile the DCU of today with the multiple universes of the Silver and Bronze Ages. While it may not be a book for anyone, it's a good place for a comics fan to jump back in.<br />In a loose way, this book acts as the concluding installment of a trilogy, the other two parts being \\"Crisis on Multiple Earths\\" and \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\" All three books are worth reading.	2003-02-25

This is clearly a part of a series, not a work intended to stand alone, and should be treated as such.<br />First, the general premise: On the world of Ciress, people are governed by various mystical Guilds. Each Guild has a patron spirit, which inhabits the body of the Guild leader to provide council and enhance his or her power. On the day a new leader is going to be appointed to the Nouveau Guild, her sister is branded with a mysterious sigil. Not only is the sister, Giselle, suddenly charged with power, but all of the patron spirits are drawn into her body.<br />That's your basic premise -- for a more in-depth version, read \\"Mystic Volume One.\\" In this volume Gislle has had time to adapt and has just won a major victory over a powerful enemy. She begins behaving oddly, though, like the spoiled party girl she was before given her power, and with her irresponsible attitude, the whole world could be in jeopardy.<br />It speaks well for writer Tony Bedard and former writer Ron Marz that when Giselle becomes the sort of character she was at the beginning of the series the reader experiences a tremendous jolt. That means she's changed, grown, and become a better character along the way. Naturally there's a reason for all of this, but you'll have to read the book to find out what it is. It's well worth it, too. Check out the first three \\"Mystic\\" volumes, then come back for this one.	2003-02-13

The basic concept is still good -- three kids tossed through one hardship after another rather than winding up with a storybook happy ending. However, three books into the series, absolutely nothing is changing. The stories of each book are nearly identical -- things start out bad for the Baudelaire orphans. Count Olaf shows up, anxious to get their money. Mr. Poe and the other adults prove themselves to be idiots by not believing them. Count Olaf is thwarted. Repeat.<br />The characters are wooden. I've read three books in this series and I haven't learned anything new about any of the main characters since page 5 of the FIRST book.<br />The only thing that has saved the series for me thus far is the writing. It's good. Very good. Funny, clever (although not as clever as it thinks it is) and capable of pulling the reader along through a story that offers nothing new.<br />I'll try the next volume, at least, more on the recommendation of a friend than of any remaining intrigue on my part.

I got it from Amazon.com and read the whole thing in about two hours. It's a good, satisfying book, but not quite what I expected. I never thought I'd say this, but probably the best thing about the book is the introduction.<br />Monte Schulz, son of the great Charles, uses the introduction to cast his father as a lover of books and as someone who always thought of his work as low art. (Personally, I consider \\"Peanuts\\" to be among the highest art there is). The stories Monte tells about his father are wonderful and made me feel a bit closer to one of my heroes.<br />The strips collected here, most of which feature Snoopy pounding away at his infamous typewriter or getting a rejection slip (sometimes tied to a rock) are excellent. I've always said that anybody can find his or herself in a Peanuts [comic] strip -- I'm in MOST of the strips about Snoopy.<br />Where the book falls somewhat short is in the essays collected from some really great writers. Rather than being anything really groundbreaking or informative, most of them are little more than pep talks. The one from Julia Child is completely superfluous unless you're out to write the world's greatest cookbook.<br />It's a worthwhile book, especially if you're a writer who loves Peanuts.

The first book in the series \\"Batman: The Stone King,\\" was okay. \\"Wonder Woman: Mythos,\\" I'm sorry to say, is mediocre at best.<br />The story has promise -- a honeymooning couple scuba-diving in the Bermuda Triangle uncovers an island of men planted as an army for Ares, the God of War. Wonder Woman and the Justice League are called in to rescue the husband and, as it turns out, save the world. Standard superhero stuff, but it could have gone somewhere.<br />Unfortunately, it really didn't. There were a lot of minor problems -- anarchronisms like the Justice League operating out of the satellite instead of the Watchtower, for instance -- that got under my skin, but that I could have forgiven if the story were better. Sadly, it just wasn't.<br />None of the JLA is written in character. The Flash and Green Lantern are, at times, bizarrely analytical. Oracle feels \\"off\\" to say the least. Wonder Woman -- she's supposed to be the star here, but Carol Lay never conveys the sense of nobility, the regal air that the likes of George Perez and Phil Jimenez have created in the comic book. She tosses around uncharacteristic slang and doesn't seem quite as capable as fans know her to be.<br />The whole thing came out hokey. A weak effort. Dennis O'Neil is doing the next book in the series, starring Green Lantern. I'll keep my fingers crossed that the old master can do better.	2003-02-07

Things are looking up for them... for about a minute, until someone they hoped never to see again steps back into their lives.<br />I have to admit, I liked this book better than the first book in the \\"Unfortunate Events\\" series, but there are still moments where I found it a bit too self-aware. The constant definitions, for example, were a cute device for about the first two pages of the first book and then immediately lapsed into pure tedium. They are even more tedious in book two.<br />However, the clever bits are better than they were in the first book as well. The beginning of chapter three is one of the funniest passages I've ever read, in addition to simply being well-written. The death of a certain character is far more morbid than I would have suspected in a book with this alleged target age group (I suspect it was written with kids a bit older than the reported 9-12 in mind), and there is an instance of a single page of one word that is framed so perfectly that it knocked me out of my chair laughing.<br />So I'll read book three now. Who am I kidding? I've gotta see where this is going.	2003-01-31

This, naturally, edges the city of Ankh-Morpork to the brink of war with Klatch for no apparent reason.<br />One of the things that made this book stand out, even from the other Watch books, is how Pratchett got to shine a spotlight on some lesser-used characters. Corporal Nobbs (\\"Nobby\\") gets a great, brilliantly funny subplot that starts with him wanting to find a nice girl and concludes someplace so wonderfully absurd I refuse to spoil it for you. Vimes is the level-headed leader of men we've come to expect. Even Lord Vetinari gets a chance to shine in this book like he hasn't in the earlier volumes. My personal favorite character, Captain Carrot, is pushed a bit to the background this time out, but he gets so much development in the other books it's hard to complain. Even here there are a few moments that show exactly how superhumanly rational Carrot is, rounding him out quite nicely.<br />Pratchett can blend satire, comedy and adventure in a way no one else can. If the day ever comes where I tire of the Discworld, you'll have to roll me away under a tarp.	2003-01-30

As a novelization, though, I found this pretty weak.<br />Max Allan Collins is a great crime writer, and his original \\"Road to Perdition\\" is one of the best graphic novels I've ever read, but this novelization of the movie based on his graphic novel really lacks teeth. I understand Collins turned in a draft nearly twice as long as this book and the publisher forced him to trim it -- if that is the case, it shows. The book feels tremendously abbreviated, with important scenes and dialogue condensed at every turn. The emotion isn't quite there.<br />Collins intends to write two more novels to complete what he envisioned as a trilogy to begin with. If he does that, I hope he can convince the publisher to release the unabridged version of this book first to really do the story justice.	2003-01-21

Like its predecessor, this volume is an excellent look into the history of the original Captain Marvel. By saying the magic word \\"Shazam,\\" boy reporter Bill Batson is transformed into the world's mightiest mortal. In this book, Captain Marvel battles aliens, robots, vampires and a fellow defender of justice who has fallen under mind control.<br />The last story in this book is where we start to see some of the humor and tongue-in-cheek superheroics that would become the trademark of Captain Marvel. That's not to say it doesn't have its other highlights, though. There are four stories here done by the legendary team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby -- and while they are distinctly different from the Bill Parker/CC Beck/Otto Binder Cap, they're still good.<br />Of particular note is the seven-part serial collected in its entirety in this volume, in which Cap's \\"Whiz Comics\\" co-star, Spy Smasher, becomes hypnotized by the insidious Mask and begins a violent vendetta against America. Cap is called upon to battle his fellow defender of liberty in a story that took up the serials of both heroes for four issues of Whiz, one of the earliest comic book crossovers. It's a crying shame the author of this great story is listed as \\"unknown.\\" I can't wait for volume three.	2003-01-20

I read this book, initially, because of the frequent comparisons I heard drawn between it and the Harry Potter series, which I love. While this was an interesting book, I don't quite understand the comparison -- it's like comparing \\"Lord of the Rings\\" to \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"  They are entirely different realms of fiction. While the Potter books are generally hopeful, this goes for a more bleak tone. There's no magic or element of fantasy in this book either, it's just an unusual little tale that isn't bad, but leaves one wondering.<br />The author frequently warns the audience that the story of the Baudelaire orphans is an unhappy one, which it is, but at the end of the book it doesn't seem quite as hopeless as the tone would lead you to believe. These are bright, resourceful children who have been tragically orphaned and taken in by a cruel, scheming relative (never seen that in fiction before, have we?), but they are SO bright and SO resourceful that by the time the book ends you are confident that no matter what \\"unfortunate event\\" happens next they will find a way to make it through.<br />The author writes in an almost conversational style, as though the reader is in a circle of children crowded around him. He even takes this to the extreme of defining words for you, which is cute the first few times, but as a device is enormously overused. Plus, it betrays the true intended audience of the book. If you're writing for an audience that doesn't know what \\"fitfully\\" means, you won't write, \\"fitfully,\\" you'll write \\"restlessly.\\" And don't even get me started on \\"adroit.\\"<br />The children are likeable, though, and you find yourself feeling sorry for them. Sorry enough, at least, to consider reading book two. I suspect that also has an ending that leaves you sympathetic enough to march on towards part the third, and so on.<br />It's a clever book, but not quite as clever as it thinks it is, and it's clearly not a book everyone will enjoy. But I think many people will.<br />Oh -- and one personal gripe. It's a \\"rough cut\\" book, meaning the edges of the pages are ragged and don't line up with one another. I suppose this is done for effect, but I HATE \\"rough cut\\" books. Just thought I'd throw that in there.will.<br />Oh -- and one personal gripe.

Busiek has created an entire universe with the feel and flavor of everything good about Marvel and DC's superheroes, yet injected them with his own flavor. He's got twists that make archetypes a little different than you'd expect -- sometimes a little more human, sometimes a little less, always something you wouldn't have thought of yourself but that leaves you slapping your forehead and going, \\"of COURSE!\\"<br />\\"Confessions\\" is the second Astro City collection, and the first extended storyline. (The first trade paperback, \\"Life in the Big City,\\" was a collection of single-issue stories, this is one story over six chapters). Brian Kinney has come to Astro City in the hopes of becoming a superhero, a wish that seems on its way to fulfillment when the mysterious Confessor takes him under his wing. But the city is troubled at the moment. A serial killer terrorizes the people of Shadow Hill. Public sentiment is turning against superheroes. And Brian's mentor is not at all what he appears to be.<br />For all of the great work Busiek has done, this book is easily my favorite. It's everything that makes \\"Astro City\\" great -- classic archetypes twisted around, lots of mysteries, a logical but unexpected point of view... it is superhero storytelling at its finest.<br />This book also contains the short \\"The Nearness of You,\\" which -- I'm sorry, Alan Moore fans -- gets my vote for finest single issue comic book story ever. It is tender, heartbreaking and wholly uplifting all at the same time. I still get teary-eyed when I read it.<br />\\"Astro City\\" is set to finally return to comic book shelves. If you haven't read it before, get books like this for a primer, then jump on-board!	2003-01-15

This is a difficult review to write because, frankly, I'm still trying to figure out if I like this book or not. Peter David's clean, easy writing style is still there, as is his rapier wit, and the story is as epic a fantasy as one can attempt in a medieval setting without having people scream that you're just aping \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Still... I'm still not sure how I feel.<br />Apropos, our protagonist, has two main goals -- find the knight who raped his mother, thus resulting in his existence, and find the Journeyman who later killed her. In neither case does he have a clear idea of what the heck he'll do when this goal is accomplished, and along the way he winds up becoming a Squire, the escort to a princess and an unlikely hero in a story that by all rights belonged to someone else. Or did it?<br />The book raises cynicism to a new bar, and that's probably why I have problems with it. I'm not a big fan of cynical fiction. But then, the ending leaves you wondering if the previous 646 pages were really as cynical as you were led to believe. It's longer than Peter David's usual work, but it reads at lightning speed. It is liberally peppered with enormously bad puns, usually (but not always) revolving around the names of various characters, but even those don't really hurt the book any further than causing the reader to look up just long enough to say something like, \\"The Harpers Bizarre. Cute,\\" and then keep reading.<br />Apropos is, to put it bluntly, a Grade-A creep, but even though he's our first-person narrator you start to feel like you know him a bit better than he knows himself. You start to believe that somewhere amidst all that anger and self-loathing and utter disregard for anyone else there may well be a hero after all.<br />Or maybe not.<br />So you see, I still can't tell you if I liked this book, but I can tell you I'm extremely anxious to read the next one in the series. And in the end, what more can you ask from a novel?	2003-01-10

That's not to say it's BAD, mind you, but I think Captain Marvel needed a little time to find his stride.<br />Billy Batson, an orphaned newsboy, is led down an abandoned subway tunnel where he encounters the wizard Shazam, who endows him with a gift. By speaking the wizard's name, Billy Batson is transformed in the world's mightiest mortal, Captain Marvel!<br />The stories, by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck, are typical of superhero comics of the 1940s -- with the superhero going to battle against the Axis forces that are always alluded to but never quite earmarked as the same foes America had not yet faced in the real world (\\"Nazis\\" becoming \\"Gnatzis\\", for instance). Remember, at the time these books were published, America was still several months away from Pearl Harbor and, with it, total war.<br />The book reads best as a historical oddity -- it's interesting to note some of the odd, very un-PC stereotypes Parker and Beck get away with, from their depiction of Asian characters to an issue where Billy actually disguises himself in blackface!<br />Towards the end of this volume the stories begin to hit their stride -- the second-to-last story, in which the evil Dr. Sivana works out a mathematical formula that allows him to become intangible, is my favorite in the book. I'm glad DC has continued this series -- up to the third volume now -- because I've read some of the later \\"Captain Marvel\\" stories and I know for a fact that once the series started to hit, it hit on all cylinders, becoming one of the finest superhero comics ever. Read this book for your introduction, then move on to the really good stuff Fawcett Comics did with the Marvels later.	2003-01-08

The producers have always shied away from having any set layout for Springfield, so don't expect to find any maps in here, any routes from the Simpson home to Springfield Elementary or anything like that. Instead, it's an amusing look at the various places that have made the show funny.<br />The book takes a lot of the show's minor jokes -- the two \\"Nick's\\" bowling shops in town, for instance -- and expands them slightly to have little entries for the \\"visitor\\" to Springfield.<br />People unfamiliar with the show won't get the point, but those of us who have watched and loved it for years will. The most fun in the book is reading the entry for a place or \\"artifact\\" and trying to recall which episode it was used in -- kind of geeky? Maybe.

It never fell into that trap. Focusing both on the strip and the way it evolved, this feels like (if possible) an even more thorough telling of the Peanuts story. It has rarer strips than \\"Golden Celebration\\" as well as comments made by Schulz at various points in his career that help shed insight on how he crafted these stories.<br />There are lots of sidebars in this book -- pictures of \\"Peanuts\\" merchandise and the stories behind the items abound, for example. There are also photos of things like Schulz's drawing board and art tools, just as he left them after finishing the final \\"Peanuts\\" strip.<br />Jean Schulz, in the introduction, starts by saying that Sparky was a genius. I think most of us who want this book already knew that, but it's beautiful to have this reminder. Every \\"Peanuts\\" fan simply must read it and treasure it.	2003-01-02

The thinking man has already pondered many of the issues this book brings up, but it examines them in a more analytical way that helps to focus your thinking.<br />The book is essentially a collection of essays connecting \\"The Matrix\\" (and occasionally other films) to the modern school of thinking. As such, it could have used some editing -- the analogy to Descarte's demon allegory is certainly pertinent, but we don't need it explained to us 18 times.<br />The essays generally fall into two categories -- those which use \\"The Matrix\\" as a starting point for serious philosophical debate and those which attempt to apply schools of thought that the filmmakers almost certainly never intended (virtually the entire final segment of the book is like this). The former work very well, the latter do not.<br />For fans of \\"The Matrix\\" who want to examine it as more than just a film but as a question that doesn't really have an answer, this is a great place to start.	2002-12-30

It's a good book, but it's really for the Superman novice.<br />The book contains a lot of illustrations punctuated by brief text blocks explaining a character or event or place in Superman's life. The diagrams of places like the Fortress of Solitude were probably my favorite bit, since those were the only bits I hadn't seen before.<br />There was also a timeline at the end that encapsulated major events in the Superman mythos since his creation in 1938 -- a good addition. I would have liked to have seen it go a step further -- maybe a brief segment on the Superman creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster, or on the cultural impact the character has had over the last 60+ years. He is, after all, along with Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny, one of the most famous fictional characters in existence. I can understand the omission, though, since this is clearly a book intended for younger readers.<br />If you're a longtime Superman fan, you won't find much new in here, but it's still a nice keepsake. It's best for parents whose kids may just be getting into comics and superheroes and wants to know more about the Man of Steel -- for them, it's probably the best one-stop reference available.	2002-12-27

I don't care what it takes -- get David Goyer and Geoff Johns writing the regular Justice League monthly comic RIGHT NOW.<br />Goyer and Johns already are the regular writers on JSA -- the Justice Society of America. For superhero neophytes, here it is in a nutshell -- the JSA were the first superhero team ever. These days it is comprised of elder statesmen like the original Flash, Green Lantern and Wildcat guiding younger second-generation heroes like the new Star-Spangled Kid and Mr. Terrific. The JLA made up of the current superhero top dogs, featuring Superman, Batman, the current Flash and GL and the like. In this tale the two teams gather for what they hope will become a Thanksgiving tradition, only to have their celebration thrown into turmoil when members of the two teams are possessed by the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. (You've heard of `em, right? Sloth, Gluttony, Lust, Anger, Pride, Envy and Greed?) The possessed members dispatch their teammates and go on a rampage, leaving the others to try to free themselves, save their friends and find out who's behind this madness.<br />While a knowledge of DC Comics continuity helps, it is by no means a necessity to read this book. Goyer and Johns have written brilliant interpretations of the JSA for years now, and in this book they prove they can handle the JLA as well. Not only that, they can balance the two teams, giving each hero his or her moment in the sun, and utilize and develop not one, but three villains (not counting the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man) in a story worthy of the best these teams have to offer.<br />The artwork by Carlos Pacheco is brilliant. Superman looks strong, Captain Marvel looks innocent, every hero and heroine is perfect, and the double-page spread near the climax of the reunited heroes storming into battle is something I'd frame and hang on any wall.<br />This book is the best these heroes have been treated in years. Here's hoping Goyer, Johns and Pacheco grace us with another one soon.	2002-12-19

Frank Baum was one of the great fantasy writers of the early 20th century -- in fact, were it not for Tolkien, I'd be tempted to call him the greatest in 100 years. His Oz books created a beautiful, vibrant land that still draws readers a century later. This book, his twist on the legend of Santa Claus, is part of that wonderful tapestry he wove.<br />Forget all of the Santa Claus legends you've read before -- there's no North Pole, no elves, no Bergermeistermeisterberger -- the story starts with a baby found in the woods by the fairy Necile. She raises him as her son, Claus (or \\"Ni-claus,\\" meaning \\"Little Claus\\"), until the child begins to wonder about his own people. Shown the dangers of the human world by the great Ak, Claus decides to venture forth amongst the mortals regardless.<br />Claus gets a lot of credit in this story, from inventing the first toy to inspiring a war amongst immortals to retrieve them, and all of it is done in Baum's clear, clean style that is as easy to read today as it was in his time. It might not be the best book for a small child, who may ask questions trying to reconcile this unique version of Santa with the one he knows, but for an older child who understands that the spirit of Santa Claus is what's important it is a wonderful book. I re-read it every December.	2002-12-17

With the more recent books, the Babylon 5 series has avoided that trap and told some great stories, \\"Invoking Darkness\\" being one of the best.<br />The reason the B5 books are working when so many others fail, I think, is because the series is over and the writers are allowed to tell real stories and not just filler. Peter David's \\"Legions of Fire\\" trilogy, for instance, showed the final fate of Londo Mollari. Jeanne Cavelos' \\"Passing of the Techno-Mages\\" trilogy, of which this is the last part, uses some of the lesser-explored but most intriguing characters in the B5 universe and journeys into the dark places the show never went.<br />Galen, the techno-mage, is in hiding with the rest of his order, avoiding the Shadows and, with them, their own responsibility to the outside universe. Without giving away too much of the story -- especially for those who have read the first two books but not this one -- Galen is sent back out into the galaxy to eliminate a threat to the mages, ultimately becoming wrapped up in the events of some of the best episodes in the run of the television series, but always behind the scenes.<br />For someone who's practically got the show memorized, as I do, this is a really great story. You know the fate of many of the characters, but there are plenty of minor characters and enough ambiguity left in the major ones to keep you anxious... you know Galen will survive since he went on to appear in the \\"Crusade\\" spin-off series, but when you realize where Cavelos is going with the story the question of HOW he's going to survive becomes just as gripping as any question of \\"if.\\"<br />You also get to peek into the minds of characters from the show to explain why they were doing what they did -- the things that were done to Anna Sheridan, for instance, and how dark Morden's heart really was and how much was the influence of the Shadows. The book offers no easy answers, but instead leaves you asking eminently satisfying questions.<br />People unfamiliar with the show many not latch onto these books the way I have, but for those of you who've loved B5 since the beginning, this helps fill in some incredible gaps in an incredible epic.were done to Anna Sheridan, for instance, and how dark Morden's heart really was and how much was the influence of the Shadows.

Although CrossGen Comics has made a point of not doing any \\"superhero\\" comic books, Crux is definitely the book to give to your average superhero fan. It has all the elements of a superhero team -- a diverse group of people, each with a unique super power, thrust together into harrowing circumstances with the fate of the world resting on their shoulders.<br />Of course, like everything CrossGen does, this book has a twist. The \\"superheroes\\" in question are survivors of the lost city of Atlantis. Millennia ago, half of the Atlaneans underwent some great transformation while the rest went into cryogenic sleep on Earth to guide the developing race of humans. In the far future, seven Atlanteans are awakened to find Earth deserted, its final fate being some sort of galactic amusement park.<br />The question is, what happened to mankind, what happened to the other Atlanteans and what are these strange monsters called the Negation that attack the remnants of Earth?<br />As far as high-octane superhero mystery goes, you can't beat it. The characters are distinctive while never falling into stereotypes -- twins bicker but their powers are only strongest when together, the muscular \\"tough guy\\" of the group is really something of a pacifist. And as the title implies, this book seems to be where the keys to unlocking the mystery of the CrossGen universe lie. It also ties in very closely with another CrossGen book, \\"The Negation,\\" which is also a spectacular read.	2002-12-11

Clark and his friends, of course, investigate, and the situation gets worse when one of their classmates, a cancer sufferer, gets mixed up in the con men's schemes.<br />Stern is one of the best Superman writers the comic books ever saw and his novel \\"The Death and Life of Superman\\" is a great adaptation of nearly a year of comic book continuity, so the problem with this book isn't in the writing or the story, but in an inherent problem with the medium. Everything from Star Trek to Buffy to the X-Files suffers when people try to translate it to other medium because -- as the television series is still the primary medium -- the creators simply aren't allowed to make many changes to the status quo or develop the characters. The most you can hope for is a little undisclosed backstory, which this book does provide. (For instance, did you know that Pete's mother is a judge?)<br />It's an okay book by a great writer and worth it for \\"Smallville\\" fans... just don't expect anything mindblowing.	2002-12-02

It amazes me how Dave Barry managed to take what was essentially a really easy way to crank out a couple of columns -- asking his readers what they thought the worst rock songs are -- and expanded that into an entire book. I suppose it's because (judging by some of the responses) Barry's readers are often as clever and witty as the man himself.<br />This book, mostly Barry's observations about music but liberally peppered with comments from his readers, is simply a blast. Separated into sections like \\"Death Rock\\" and \\"Weenie Rock,\\" he tackles just about everybody. Even when you find that he's making fun of a song you LIKE, you'll still chuckle and think, \\"Well, he's got a point...\\"<br />Dave Barry fans have already made this a favorite -- folks who have an appreciation of pop music over the past few decades will like it as well.	2002-11-27

One of the wonderful things about the CrossGen line is that there really are books for fans of any genre -- \\"Negation\\" for hard sci-fi fans, \\"Sojourn\\" for the Tolkienites, \\"Route 666\\" for horror buffs, \\"Way of the Rat\\" for Kung-Fu lovers... \\"Ruse\\" is the book for fans of a good old-fashion Sherlock Holmes-style mystery... but with some big twists. Holmes and Watson were never the mysteries themselves, after all.<br />Our heroes are Simon Archard, the brilliant detective of the city of Partington, and his assistant (or partner, depending on whom you ask), the beautiful Emma Bishop. This initial case introduces our heroes, Archard's cadre of \\"agents\\" he employs from time to time and also is a very good murder mystery.<br />But our heroes are mysteries themselves, ones without easy answers. Emma has strange powers that she hides from Simon, and while this book does not appear to feature a \\"sigil-bearer\\" (the superpowered protagonists of many CrossGen titles), Simon himself discretely wears the sigil on his clothing. Why?<br />The whole CrossGen universe is a mystery. \\"Ruse\\" gives it a detective. The best question left is, will the audience solve the puzzle before Simon and Emma?	2002-11-26

I'll be honest, as big a fan as I am of Terry Pratchett's \\"Discworld\\" series, I was left very cold by \\"Equal Rites\\" and \\"Wyrd Sisters.\\" I figured the Granny Weatherwax tract of stories simply wasn't for me. But \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies\\" and \\"Maskerade\\" have changed my mind -- I may go back and give those earlier books another chance.<br />Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg are one witch short for their coven after the events of \\"Lords and Ladies.\\" Nanny suggests recruiting local girl Agnes Nitt, who has displayed some talent in the past. There's only one problem -- Agnes has left their home of Lancre to pursue a career in the Ankh-Morpork opera. Granny, Nanny and Greebo the cat embark upon yet another journey.<br />Like the best of the Discworld books, this one succeeds because it has a tight focus for its satire -- in this case, the opera. Particularly the works of a certain Mr. Webber. Pratchett shows skill at finding each little detail, each inconsistency, each nit just waiting to be picked and then putting it on display for the whole world in a fashion satisfying to both fans and detractors of that which he satires. Also, as with \\"Men at Arms,\\" he manages to mingle the whole thing with a quite satisfying mystery -- who is the \\"Ghost\\" in the Ankh-Morpork Opera House? Why is he killing people? Why is he grooming Agnes to be a performer? It's a great, silly little tale and one of the better Discworld books. Maybe that's why I didn't like the early ones... maybe Terry Pratchett has just gotten that much better as he's come along.	2002-11-19

Where else could you get the entire history of the Legion of Super-Heroes (in order of publication, no less?) -- up to ELEVEN volumes now!<br />This first volume, of course, contains the first several appearances of the Legion and of Legion-related characters, back when they were mainly supporting members of the Superboy -- and later Supergirl -- cast. The Legion plays a very peripheral role in several of the stories -- the one where Supergirl is trying to find Superman a wife, for instance -- and in some the Legion doesn't appear  at all (such as the Mon-El and Ultra Boy origin stories where the Legion is merely alluded to). Eventually the book makes it to the era where the Legion got their own serial -- \\"Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes,\\" and although members of the Super-family still appear in most of these, the Legion is finally being allowed to come into its own.<br />The characters introduced in this volume range from the inspiring (Brainiac 5, trying to atone for his ancestor's sins, the poor, exiled Mon-El, etc.) to the deliciously silly (I confess, I'm a big fan of Matter-Eater Lad and Bouncing Boy. I'm probably the ONLY fan of Matter-Eater Lad and Bouncing Boy) and this book also contains something that was pretty rare at the time -- the death of a superhero. You just didn't see that sort of thing in DC Comics in 1958.<br />I can't wait to pick up volume two. Oh -- and kudos to DC for keeping the cover design of their Archives uniform for so long. Unlike Marvel's similar \\"Masterworks\\" series, I can start my LSH Archives collection right now and I know that all eleven volumes will look like a set on my shelf once I've got them. It's a small thing, I know, but it's something I appreciate.	2002-11-13

Because I already read probably about two-thirds of the CrossGen line, I was planning to skip \\"The Negation\\" when it came out. (Not because the CrossGen books weren't good, but just the opposite! I couldn't afford any more!) The clerk at my comic shop dropped the Prequel issue into my reserved folder by mistake, and I decided to pick it up anyway -- and got immediately hooked.<br />Although each CrossGen comic series stands on its own, they do take place in a shared universe with clues as to an overall pattern appearing in each title. For fans like myself, who enjoy solving the puzzle, this book and Crux are absolutely essential. All of the diverse elements and intriguing potentials of the universe come together in these books. \\"The Negation\\" is about a band of characters from the CrossGen universe -- some from worlds we have visited in the other titles, others we have not -- who are abducted by the Negation and brought to their own universe for experimentation. A few of them break out and begin themselves to piece together the mysteries CrossGen readers have pondered since the company debuted -- What are the Negation? What do they want? What is the secret of the sigils?<br />This is a book for any comic fan who digs science fiction, fantasy, mystery, military-style action or superheroics. In fact, the only downside to this book is that once you start reading it, you'll want to get ALL of the CrossGen titles to help you piece it together.	2002-11-13

And now, having read the book, I've got to approach it with a resounding, \\"So what?\\"<br />Okay -- the good stuff first. The artwork by Adam Kubert and Richard Isanove is absolutely wonderful. Kubert's sense of storytelling is second to none and Isanove's gorgeous, lush painted-colors process is something I'd love to see more often.<br />But the story... the STORY... Paul Jenkins, as he has proven with his work on Spider-Man, is a superb writer, so for the life of me I can't figure out how \\"Origin\\" wound up with such a so-so story. It felt like he was playing a \\"fill in the blank\\" game when he, Joe Quesada and (ugh) Bill Jemas put the story together. \\"Okay, what do we know about Wolverine? He's Canadian, he calls himself Logan and he's got a thing for redheads. Can we do anything with that?\\"<br />It isn't a BAD book, but the story doesn't really have any jarring or eye-popping revelations, no outstanding surprises and no real lasting repercussions for the regular X-Men titles, unless Wolverine were to somehow regain his memory of these events. Even then, I'm not sure how much of a difference that would really make, either in terms of story or characterization. Jemas said Marvel did this book because they wanted to do \\"The greatest story Marvel's never told.\\" I've gotta say, if this is indicative of the rest of those \\"untold tales,\\" they may as well stay that way.	2002-11-12

In his second novel, Dave Barry has taken his readers out to sea for a fast-paced action yarn that is as funny as it is exciting.<br />Tricky Business is a real ensemble story about a casino ship out of Miami that is used to launder money and traffic in narcotics, unbeknownst to the patrons or most of the staff. On the day this story takes place (all in one day -- difficult to do and keep it exciting, but Barry does it), the ship is going out into Tropical Storm Hector, despite all safety warnings to the contrary, because of a shipment of drugs and cash too big to let go. The characters include a musician with a crush on a cocktail waitress, a pair of old men who just want out of their retirement home, a captain who wanted to give up a life of crime, a man in a giant pink conch costume, some stupid criminals, some smart criminals and the crew of a TV news station that suffer a freak chain of events I suspect many of us here on the Gulf Coast secretly wish would happen to REAL news anchors when they start scaremongering and stupid reporting whenever a storm hits.<br />Like Barrys first novel, Big Trouble, the dialogue and descriptions take a plot that would work just as well in a hardcore drama and make it a good, lighthearted comedy that has a real sweetness to it at the end. Fans of Dave Barry, the funniest columnist in America, are probably lining up for this book already, but fans of a good action comedy will enjoy it too.	2002-11-06

Pratchett prides himself on making each Discworld novel a work that can stand on its own, apart from the rest of the series, and while he is mostly successful in this, it can't be denied that familiarity with the older books makes the newer ones go down easier.<br />In \\"Interesting Times\\" Rincewind, the world's worst Wizard, gets transported to a far-off continent where people expect him to be some sort of magical genius. While there he encounters Cohen the Barbarian, a geriatric marauder, who has assembled a small \\"Silver Horde\\" of wizened old warriors to conquer the Empire. People discount the old barbarians. What they don't take into account is that most barbarians don't LIVE to be the old kind...<br />It was a funny book the first time I read it. It was even cute. But after having read the books prior to this one, especially \\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"Sourcery\\" and \\"Eric,\\" this book took on a whole new dimension. I now grasped the prior relationships between Rincewind, Cohen and Twoflower, and I no longer read each luggage passage wondering what the heck was going on. It was, simply put, a better book.<br />So this is a great book and a worthy addition to the Discworld series, but if you haven't read it yet, I suggest reading those other three I mentioned first.	2002-11-04

When a monstrous dragon appears in Europe, the Oracle at Delphi makes a prediction to Wonder Woman -- the Justice League will defeat the dragon, but perish in the attempt. Wonder Woman swears, then, to save her teammates from death the only way she can -- by defeating them each, one at a time, and then facing the dragon alone.<br />Simply put, this is one of the best portrayals of Wonder Woman I've ever read. She is gentle, but decisive, a woman of peace but ready for battle in an instant when she sees no other way. She is strong (as shown in her battles with Batman and the Flash) and wise (by taking Superman out of the picture the only way she could). She's a full, rounded, honest character, and that alone makes the book worthwhile.<br />Furthermore, this story gives us something every comic fan loves to see -- heroes in a good scrap with each other. The problem is that those stories almost always involve some stupid misunderstanding or mind control or some other contrived plot device -- but not this time. It's perfectly in character and exciting to boot.<br />Moeller's artwork is also beautiful. Although more suited for a fantasy story than a superhero tale, that's what this grapic novel really is -- a fantasy that happens to feature the JLA. There's one portrait of Wonder Woman emerging from dragonfire, her bracelets glowing with heat, that's absolutely breathtaking. (This illustration is used on the back of the paperback edition of this book -- even if you don't get it, check out that art!)<br />\\"A League of One\\" is well worth the purchase for any fan of fantasy comics or Wonder Woman. It's great to see DC doing some good, original graphic novels.	2002-11-01

All of the major cities do on this planet. Her world changes one day when her father and uncle are both infused with a mysterious power marked by a Sigil that appears on their bodies. Her uncle allows Sephie's father to die in this exchange, but not before his power is passed to Sephie.<br />This first \\"Meridian\\" trade is a great story, but to really get a feel for how good this series is, you've got to read them all. The way Sephie grows over the course of this tale is nothing short of spectacular. She begins as little more than your [typical] fairy tale princess, carefree, wrapped up in events she was unready for, but as time progresses she matures into a strong, intelligent young woman, a fighter when need be, a healer when possible.<br />The things CrossGen has done for the comic book industry in the past few years are nothing short of phenomenal, and out of all of their spectacular titles, \\"Meridian\\" stands as my favorite. It is genuinely a story that can be shared with anyone from children to adults, male or female, without insulting their intelligence or demeaning them, and delivers a good, positive message to boot. When I'm trying to get a female to try comic books, this is now the one I suggest to them first.	2002-10-29

The reason for this, I think, is that Pratchett uses the format to its fullest potential, creating several groups of characters that he visits time and again, never having any single group act as the star of the entire series, and using it to tackle diverse subjects without ever repeating himself.<br />\\"Men at Arms\\" is the second Discworld book to focus on Captain Vimes and the men -- um... humans... er... beings -- of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (the first being \\"Guards! Guards!\\") and it has firmly cemented these characters as my favorite recurring heroes in the Discworld universe.<br />Time is running out for Captain Sam Vimes -- because he's getting married. Furthermore, his beloved night watch is being tampered with by higher-ups calling for \\"greater diversity\\" in the hirings, forcing him to welcome trolls, dwarfs and women into the group. To make matters worse, someone has stolen a strange new weapon from the assassin's guild and is using it to kill people. Vimes, Carrot, Nobby and the gang have to find the murderer and save the day.<br />Funny, yes, but also particularly poignant in light of recent events in the Washington D.C. area. I read this book a few months ago, before the unpleasantness began... this may be just the thing to help you cope.	2002-10-28

This book forms sort of a trilogy with two other DC trade paperbacks: \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" and \\"History of the DC Universe.\\" All three books are worth reading, but this is the one tailor-made for silver age fans and people who love the Justice League.<br />Many years ago, you see, DC established that their heroes of the 1930s and 40s lived in a different universe than the heroes of the 50s they were currently publishing -- an \\"Earth-2.\\" (Why was the home of the ORIGINAL characters called \\"Earth-2\\"? Who knows?) Since the Flashes of the two worlds had met on occasion, the creators of the Justice League of America comic book decided it was time for the current heroes to meet their predecessors, the first superhero team in comics, the Justice Society of America. That first story was successful and became a more-or-less annual event that lasted until the Crisis on Infinite Earths eliminated multiple universes from DC Comics.<br />This book collects the first several JLA/JSA pairings, each two parts and all done with style, class and a touch of that campy silver age charm that still makes the stories a lot of fun 40 years later. It's great to see DC showing this kind of respect to the classic stories in its library...	2002-10-24

By now I've gotten through about half of his library (give me a break, I got a late start!) and I've read every new book as it has come out since 1994 -- so I think I'm in a good position when I say that King hasn't been this gripping in years.<br />\\"From a Buick 8\\" begins (not unlike King's \\"Bag of Bones\\") with the death of one of the main characters,  Pennsylvania State Trooper Curtis Wilcox. Curtis's grief-stricken son Ned turns to his father's police troop as a surrogate family and they take him in. But Troop D has a secret -- a secret they've kept for over 20 years, one that nearly consumed Curtis. In an old shed is a classic Buick Roadmaster, but one unlike anything Detroit ever put out. There's something terrible about that car, and it's time for Ned to learn the truth.<br />Like many King fans, when I heard about this one I thought, \\"Another car book? King's starting to repeat himself.\\" But the similarities to \\"Christine\\" end with the car -- this is a very different, more mature story as much about human nature as it is about monsters and other dimensions. I haven't been pulled in like this since the aforementioned \\"Bag of Bones.\\"<br />Curiously enough, in the afterward King says he wrote the first draft of this book after finishing \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\\" which I found to be one of his weaker works in recent years. (This was before his own nearly-fatal vehicular accident, by the way.) Fortunately for us all, it seems King managed to work out the kinks. King says he'll be retiring soon. If his last few works manage to convey the emotion of \\"From a Buick 8,\\" I think it's safe to say he'll go out on a high note.	2002-10-23

I've never lived in such a world, nor do I think I would want to.<br />This book is a look into the process of making what is inarguably one of the most-loved Holiday specials ever. Everything about the cartoon is in here -- from the journey to get it on the air to the dangerously abbreviated production time to the perils of casting real children to play the Peanuts gang -- the first time children played children in American animation, by the way, and some of them were too young to even read their lines.<br />And of course, the piece de resistance, the book includes the complete screenplay, written by the brilliant Charles M. Schulz himself. A sweet, humble man, I doubt he really knew at the time how wonderful his creation was or how important it would become to so many.<br />This is a fabulous book and seems to be designed as a companion to \\"Peanuts: A Golden Celebration,\\" which was released a few years ago. Both of them are simply invaluable for anyone who loves Peanuts.	2002-10-22

At this point it seems that Baum was getting a little weary, and it shows, as this book has almost no discernable plot or conflict at all. Dorothy, again, gets lost in a fairyland, and again makes her way to the Emerald City, assembling a small band of strange and endearing characters along the way -- the same as she'd done three times before. What made this a weak entry is that there was no sense of urgency here. Dorothy was never worried, she knew as soon as she found Ozma she'd have a way home, there was no villain... by the time she made it to the Emerald City the book had been liberally dotted with references to how everyone in Oz loved one another and nobody was ever mean -- unless, of course, you're a wicked witch, but they had both long been vanquished at this point.<br />The land of Oz is built on strange situations and characters, but also on story. In the original \\"Wizard of Oz,\\" Dorothy and her friends faced the witch, hoping to send her home. In \\"The Land of Oz,\\" Pip had to deal with an entire invasion of the Emerald City. In \\"Ozma of Oz\\" there was the wonderful story of the rescue of the Royal Family of Ev.<br />By book four, \\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,\\" Baum seemed to have run out of plots and contented himself, in these few volumes, with just bringing in new characters and not bothering to craft a story around them. In book six, \\"The Emerald City of Oz,\\" he took the step of placing Dorothy in Oz permanently, which was probably the best thing he'd ever done, because later volumes no longer needed to concern themselves with finding ways to get to Oz and just told really wonderful fantasy stories. (\\"Tik-Tok of Oz\\" is still my favorite in the series.\\")<br />The Oz books, in toto (no pun intended), are wonderful for people of any age, but this installment is really for completists only.ly for completists only.	2002-10-10

I got the jokes and the tone they intended, but I also got the impression that anyone who wasn't already familiar with their work would have been left pretty cold. \\"Who are these guys? Where do they get off?\\" is a response I imagine them getting.<br />Also, while the alternating-chapter device is cute, each of them employs a running gag (in Reed's case, the story of tormenting a poor Pastor, in Austin's, struggles with his own Atheism) that really meander and get stale for about half of the book before you realize that, rather than gags, these are actually attempts at a plot. I really would have preferred they'd gotten rid of these segments and just concentrate on what does work -- the satire.<br />And when they concentrate on what they're good at, it's great. Reed's chapter on the story of Moses, which he mixes up with the film career of Charlton Heston, is one of the funniest things I've read in a long time.<br />But the good stuff is too few and far-between for the casual reader. If you're a die-hard fan of the Reduced Shakespeare Company, it's worth it. Otherwise, you'd be better off reading some of their other stuff first.	2002-09-24
US	41980939	R2TDCE0JJV8GG6	1891830341	913865424	Creature Tech	Books	5	14	15	N	N	The best graphic novel in years	Many people use the term \\"graphic novel\\" to describe any book-bound edition of comic-style storytelling, including collections of individual issues from monthly comics. Personally, I prefer to differentiate between these collections and original books, but no matter what definition you use, Doug TenNapel's \\"Creature Tech\\" is one of the best graphic novels in years.<br />The story stars Dr. Michael Ong, a former seminarian who abandoned his faith when he turned to science. Ong is the head of government facility charged with studying and cataloguing supernatural and alien artifacts and technology. What with one thing or another, Ong becomes bonded to a powerful alien symbiote and must use his new abilities to save the world from the ghost of a mad scientist who has a sinister plan involving the Shroud of Turin, a hand that can turn cats into demons, and a giant space eel.<br />It if sounds silly, that's because the concept really is. TenNapel shows incredible skill, though, in taking elements that could be used to create a weird, slapstick story and injecting it with genuine heart, emotion and action. You feel for Ong, his pastor father, the disfigured girl he used to persecute as a child and even the giant insect assigned to him as a security guard of sorts. Every character in this book has a dash of humor and a healthy dose of humanity that makes this a really great read.<br />The artwork is clean and effective, and the iconic style doesn't detract from the story at all.

Bean, once the smallest member of Ender Wiggin's world-saving jeesh, is rapidly growing -- not just into a man, but into a giant. When Ender's brother plots to free Achilles (the murderous genius who has schemed against Bean since they were children in the streets of Rotterdam), Bean and Petra Arkanian go into hiding, knowing that Peter Wiggin will never be able to control the evil genius they call \\"The Beast.\\"<br />Much of Card's fiction is a combination of a compelling character study and a serious political drama, but this contrast is much more pronounced in the \\"Shadow\\" series than in anything else he has written. I suspect this is because the \\"Shadow\\" series is not as far removed from our real-world present day as much of his other work. This doesn't stop it from being well-planned, well-researched and extremely logical -- yet still surprising. (Where else in contemporary American fiction will you find a Muslim army portrayed as the good guys?)<br />With presumably one volume to go in this series, it feels as though poor Bean is headed for a tragic, heroic end. \\"Shadow Puppets\\" leaves one major plot thread dangling, and it's not at all the one you would suspect if you've read the first two novels. I am very much looking forward to the conclusion of Bean's adventures.	2002-09-04

So in case you don't quite get it -- Bizarro is Superman's imperfect duplicate. Everything he does is the opposite of Superman. That's pretty much the gist of it.<br />This book collects the \\"Tales From Bizarro World\\" series from the old Adventure Comics title -- stories about a whole planet of Bizarros, including Bizarro-Lois Lane, Bizarro-Jimmy Olsen, Bizarro-Lex Luthor, Bizarro-Supergirl and even Bizarro-Krypto the Superdog.<br />Amazingly, these stories were written by Superman creator Jerry Siegel himself. They're pretty simple, pretty light, and some of them make absolutely no sense even in BIZARRO logic. It's fluff, but it's enjoyable fluff. It's pure, beautiful Silver Age wackiness, and it's well worth the read for any fan of Superman or goofy comic books in general. Pick it up.	2002-09-03

Both \\"Equal Rites\\" and \\"Wyrd Sisters\\" left me kind of cold.<br />\\"Witches Abroad,\\" however, really stands out and pulled me in -- perhaps because the subjects Pratchett are lampooning in this volume are both rather close to me: fairy tales (stories in general, actually) and Mardi Gras (I've lived near New Orleans my entire life).<br />Pratchett seamlessly meshes elements of Cinderella with Little Red Riding Hood with Sleeping Beauty with the Three Little Pigs with a dozen other stories we all know and love, poking as much fun at storytellers as at stories themselves.<br />I love this sort of thing, the blending of classic stories, not unlike the musical \\"Into the Woods\\" or the excellent DC/Vertigo comic book series \\"Fables,\\" and Pratchett does it as well as anyone. This is definitely the best of the Granny Weatherwax books I've read.	2002-09-02
US	41980939	R2YYADYEJTIYAA	0441009360	72874657	Knight Life	Books	4	14	15	N	N	A Well-Told Tale	As usual, Peter David manages to mingle his dry wit with the fantastic to produce a very satisfying tale. Having never read the original edition of this book, published many years ago, I can't compare the two. This expanded edition (expanded by some 30,000-plus words, according to the introduction) is a lot of fun.<br />Arthur Pendragon, King of the Britons, returns to life in the present day and runs for Mayor of New York City. With him are his perpetual advisor Merlin (whose odd habit of living his life backwards has reduced him to the form of a young boy), the immortal knight Percival (whom history neglected to mention was a Moor) and the reincarnate of his beloved Guienivere. Of course, old enemies Morgan Le Fay and Modred return to cause trouble as well.<br />The book is a nice satire of modern life and politics as well as a fun adventure yarn. I also appreciated David dotting the landscape of his New York with characters named after his colleages in the comic book world (Louise Simonson, Jim Owsley, etc.) It's the best sort of inside joke -- the kind that those who aren't in on it will never know was a joke and that those who are in on it will smile in appreciation and keep reading.<br />The sole misstep, I felt, came in a press conference scene where Arthur began outlining political positions which I suspect were crafted to reflect David's own. While this is certainly within his rights as an author, it seemed rather blatant and distracting to me.<br />Other than that, a great story, and I can't wait for the sequel.	2002-08-19

It would have been impossible for anyone, even the immensely talented Frank Miller, to live up to the bar set by that seminal work.<br />However, even taking that into account, \\"DK2\\" was a big, sloppy mess, cementing in my mind the notion that sometimes it's best to just leave well enough alone.<br />The first volume of DK2 was good enough -- if the art looked a little rushed. The story was still clear and consistent with what went on before, and it was downright exciting to see how Miller developed this alternate universe of heroes that spun out of the mainstream DC Universe prior to \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\"<br />But volume two was a little messier... and volume three was not only abhorrently late, but sloppy and, frankly, incomprehensible. The ending, what there was of one, was unclear, muddled and not at all worth the wait.<br />Even worse are the rumors that DC Comics wants to allow Miller to tell tales in this alternate-DCU of his periodically, focusing on other heroes in addition to the Batman mythos. If the results are anything like DK2 #3, it's best to leave it alone.	2002-08-15

I'll assume you've seen the movie already if you're reading this review -- although I will try to avoid spoilers regardless. Some people ask why you would bother to read a novelization of a movie -- why not watch the movie? With a poor novelization, this is usually the better option, but as Peter David has proven repeatedly in his career, he has a gift for taking a movie script, expanding upon it and making it into something of his own.<br />It's not easy to tell how much of this is David's own imagination at work and how much was something intended for the movie but wound up on the cutting room floor, but a lot of the stuff feels distinctly Peter David. A lot of the more subtle humor that is his trademark, and the wonderful prologue with a four-year-old Peter Parker moving in with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben are excellent touches you never got on the screen.<br />A movie is basically a visual medium, but most movies make compromises that leave blanks if you try to put it on paper. David's talent is to fill in those blanks and weave a really good story. This book is almost as good as some of his totally original work (by which I mean, not adapted from a screenplay) like the &quot;Star Trek: New Frontier&quot; series or the &quot;Babylon 5: Legions of Fire&quot; trilogy.<br />This is a great book for fans of the Spider-Man movie. For fans of Peter David, it's even better.	2002-05-08

Jeanne Cavelos's trilogy seems ready to fix that.<br />&quot;Casting Shadows,&quot; the first of three books, is the story of the initiation of Galen, a young Techno-Mage, and of how the Mages react to the news of the return of the Shadows.<br />I enjoyed this book a lot, on two levels. First, it gave a wonderful insight into the workings of the Techno-Mages, how the sect evolved and how they viewed themselves. Second, it was a good character study of Galen, his teacher Elric and of other Mages. It is a tragic love story disguised as a political sci-fi thriller, and I am quite anxious to see how the rest of the trilogy plays out.	2002-04-25

In a conversation with a friend of mine a while back, he told me he didn't understand why people liked &quot;Memento&quot; so much, he said all the film had was a &quot;gimmick.&quot;<br />To which I replied, &quot;it may be a gimmick, but YOU try writing a script with a gimmick like that.&quot;<br />The &quot;gimmick&quot; is the non-linear progression of the story that Christopher Nolan uses in both of the scripts in this book, &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Following.&quot; It's an experimental style of storytelling, to be certain, but it's a successful experiment. Both scripts, &quot;Memento&quot; in particular, show events not in the order they happen, but in the order of importance, and it's a brilliant way to tell the story. Nolan's a magnificent screenwriter -- can't wait for his next one.	2002-04-17

Terry Pratchett's work is often compared to Douglas Adams's classic \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" applied to fantasy rather than science fiction, but I feel that Pratchett is in another league entirely. He has an uncanny knack to find one element of society -- in this case, the film industry, and deconstruct it, poking fun at all its conventions and turning something we take for granted into a bizarre threat.<br />The magic of \\"Holy Wood\\" grips Discworld this time around, as a would-be Wizard, a former farmgirl and a talking dog become the stars of the newest product of alchemy, the moving picture. There's something sinister about the pictures, though, something that should have remained untouched...<br />The ending sequence, which I can't examine in detail without giving away too much, nearly had me paralyzed with laughter as Pratchett systematically took on every Hollywood cliche he could find. If you've ever enjoyed a \\"Discworld\\" novel, you've got to read this one. If you love the movies and you love people who can poke good-natured fun at them, you've got to read this too.	2002-04-03

As this book explains, that's because there IS no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; format, just different ways to do it.<br />Every script in this volume shows you something. Gaiman's reads like a personal note to the artist, Wolfman shows how plot-first can work, McDuffie shows you how to work in a recap, Kevin Smith shows a more movie-script style of writing and Kurt Busiek's entry... heck, when I read the original comic book I thought it was one of the greatest comic book stories I ever read, but the script for &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; just made it all the more powerful.<br />If you want to try to write comics, you could do a lot worse than picking up this book.	2002-04-03

Instead, it pauses to give backstory on some of the supporting cast, and that backstory ranges from as good or better than the regular &quot;Preacher&quot; fare to a chapter that really didn't need to be included at all.<br />Collected here are the &quot;Saint of Killers&quot; miniseries and the two one-shots, &quot;The Story of You-Know-Who&quot; and &quot;Good Old Boys.&quot;<br />&quot;Saint of Killers&quot; is the closest comic books have come to producing a masterpiece in the western genre. The story of the saint is infuriating, tragic, heartbreaking and horrifying all at the same time, and the blending of western themes with the usual theological quandries of &quot;Preacher&quot; is seamless.<br />&quot;You-Know-Who&quot; also provides backstory, this time on the series' strangest and most hideous character. An interesting tale, to be sure, but not really something necessary for the overall story.<br />To be frank, I could have done without &quot;Good Old Boys.&quot; Ennis takes time to tell a story of a pair of villains who, at that point in the story, are dead anyway, and which really sheds no new light on them or the main story. It's interesting as a parody of action films, but nothing more.<br />Overall, this collection is worth picking up for &quot;Saint of Killers&quot; alone.	2002-03-23

The plot has a lot of potential in it -- some mysterious force activates a frozen corpse and another force sends power down to six \\"chosen ones\\" to combat it. The problem comes in the execution.<br />MacDonald meanders around, bouncing through multiple characters with story arcs that feel completely superfluous. He injects so many characters that he never takes time to develop any of them, and as a result none of them have any clear motivations, causing most of their actions to seem completely nonsensical.<br />The book could also stand to slow down a little. Concepts are introducted, explained in a textbook fashion and done away with all within a few pages -- Lucifer himself is eliminated before the end of the same chapter where he is introduced. The protagonist is shown to be so powerful that there's never really any sense of drama; one simply has no doubt he can defeat the \\"enemy,\\" which in the end turns out to be something that doesn't jive with what went before at all.<br />If anything, MacDonald's book is a little too realistic. In the real world, events like these would be chaotic and tumultuous -- and that's exactly what this book is: chaotic. It might make sense in history, but it doesn't make for a great narrative.	2002-03-17

Enter Leland Gaunt, proprietor of a new shop in town, \\"Needful Things.\\" Whatever it is you want the most, Gaunt has it -- and for a very fair price. Or so it would seem.<br />Gaunt somehow knows the history of this town, the old rivalries, the quiet hatreds and the dark secrets, and he uses it to play the various characters against each other, turning the town from a powder keg into a ticking time bomb.<br />This book has all the King trademarks -- the omniscient devil-figure (Gaunt), the flawed but ultimately noble hero (Sheriff Alan Pangborn), well-realized children and dozens of fleshed out characters that bounce off each other and interact as realistically as anyone you've ever met. At once both dark and hopeful, it's a great read and worth picking up for any King fan.	2002-02-22

Michael Straczynski has revolutionized television sci-fi (&quot;Babylon 5&quot;), horror (&quot;Midnight Nation&quot;) and superheroes (&quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Rising Stars&quot;). Why not tackle fairy tales next?<br />The story centers around a group of fairies who live in a house, unseen by its human inhabitants. New ones arrive and it's like they've always been there. Old ones disappear and they are mourned. It's a clever story, but not exactly groundbreaking...<br />Until the twist at the halfway point. I refuse to give it away, but the curveball Straczynski throws regarding something as simple as the setting takes this story down a path no one would have guessed, turning it from a simple children's story to a heartbreaking cautionary tale that can appeal to anyone with even a passing knowledge of the some of the real-life horrors that have been perpetrated in this world.<br />Good for kids, great for adults, &quot;Delicate Creatures&quot; is, simply put, a must-read.	2002-02-13

In essence, it is a collection of essays from various writers about writing speculative fiction and dark fantasy, with chapters by the likes of Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch and Charles Grant. Much of the lessons do apply to Sci-Fi/Fantasy as well, although if that's your concentration I would recommend Orson Scott Card's &quot;How to Write Science Fiction&quot; before this.<br />The book is a brisk read right up until the chapter on the psychology of horror fiction which, frankly, reads like it was written by a psychologist. It was boring, tedious and felt very out of place among so many good essays.<br />The only other problem is the chapter at the end that supposedly helps you get published. While I'm sure it was quite helpful at the time it was written (in the mid-1980s), many of the publications it lists are now defunct and many of the practices have changed. It's not a bad section, it is simply past its time.<br />Regardless, for those who want to learn how to write horror from those who have done it, this book is well worth reading.	2002-02-11

Books	5	1	2	N	N	Pratchett at his best	The reason, I think, that Pratchett has managed to keep Discworld viable after over two dozen novels while other series seem to fade after four or five is that Pratchett continually introduces new characters and new tracts in his Discworld books -- Rincewind, Granny Weatherwax or Death, for instance.<br />\\"Guards! Guards!\\" is the first book to follow the adventures of Captain Vimes, and is easily as good as any other Pratchett has written. Our stalwart quartet of well-meaning bufoons provides an incredibly entertaining satire of medieval sword 'n sorcery epics -- you know, the kind where the boy finds a magic sword or slays a dragon and is therefore crowned king, regardless of any actual qualifications he may have.<br />I am attempting to work through the Discworld novels chronologically, so I don't know if Vimes, Carrot, Nobby and Colon show up again in this series.

And reading \\"Maid For Murder,\\" it's obvious. The style of the work betrays it as being written by someone more used to romance fiction. The prose often gets a bit too flowery and melodramatic, and nearly once a chapter Charlotte La Rue pauses to contemplate the horrid life she or one of the other characters has experienced. In fact, it seems that nobody in this novel has had an even remotely happy life -- practically every developed character has a past loaded with dead parents, dead spouses, divorces or some other tragedy.<br />The book is also quite clearly the beginning of a series. Several subplots are never resolved and several characters  don't really contribute to the plot. This is forgivable, however, as they help to establish Charlotte La Rue's world, which will certainly be important in future installments. The next novel in the series, the cleverly-titled \\"Death Tidies Up,\\" is due in bookstores in Feb. 2003.<br />Louisiana readers like myself will also be quite pleased with the New Orleans flavor Colley injects into the book. From accurate street names to using actual events like the Audubon Zoo's \\"Zoo To Do,\\" the book is obviously the work of someone who knows and understands the region and not by a Hollywood outsider, suffering from the delusion that the city exists in a state of perpetual Mardi Gras like most contemporary fiction does.<br />Overall, \\"Maid For Murder\\" is a passable first novel for the series, although only time will tell if the series as a whole will be able to hold up with the works of classic mystery series like Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot or more recent works such as Greg Rucka's Atticus Kodiak novels.	2002-01-22

The man could take the simplest forms -- a circle, two dots and some squiggly lines -- and create a character that exemplified the best of humanity, that made us cheer, made us laugh, broke our hearts and lifted our spirits. The reason everybody loves Charlie Brown is because everybody IS Charlie Brown.<br />That said, this book is wonderful for people who want a sampling of the greatest Peanuts strips or, for people like myself, who want to know a little more about the man who created them and how the Peanuts came to be. This reads less like a simple comic strip collection and more like a historical archive. The great strips are there, to be certain, but the accompanying text helps to show the context in which they were written. The sampling also lets you see how Charlie Brown and the gang evolved from their embryonic &quot;Lil' Folks&quot; stage to the form we all fell in love with as we grew up.<br />Anyone who likes &quot;Peanuts&quot; -- anyone with a heart, in other words -- will find something in this book for them.	2001-12-26

We can't deny that. But they are by no means the only genre -- horror comics were huge at one point, as were romances, westerns, science fiction and crime comics, all of which survive in one form or another to day.<br />But one genre which has always been oddly neglected in the realm of comics is pure, epic fantasy. I mean the Tolkien-esque, swords and sorcery style of storytelling. It has existed, to be sure, but it's never been big.<br />Kurt Busiek tried to remedy that in this woefully underrated graphic novel. The tale of an evil wizard who, frankly, isn't very good at being evil, is a wonderful story with a lot of humor, a lot of magic and a lot of heart. The artwork is beautiful and, if given the proper push, this is the sort of story that could bring fantasy into mainstream comics in a big way.<br />Busiek is one of the best writers the artform knows. &quot;Marvels&quot; and &quot;Astro City&quot; are masterpieces of superhero fiction. &quot;Shockrockets&quot; was a great science fiction tale. Now check out Busiek's take on fantasy -- you won't be disappointed.	2001-11-29

Neither did Batman or Spider-Man or the Green Lantern or any other superhero, someone had to create them. Someone had to dream them up. Someone has been ignored for a long time. Michael Chabon obviously has a true love for the comic book form, as evidenced by this and other works of his. He treats the subject with respect and admiration, and he breathes life into two of the most human characters I have ever read. Comic book fans such as myself will read this novel and be grateful that someone is finally depicting comic books with a degree of respect and honor, and people who just like a good read with engaging characters and a smart plot will enjoy this book as well.	2001-11-07

However, speaking as someone who is performance-minded, I gotta think this one goes a bit overboard. It's not the controversy -- heck, I'm Catholic myself and the jokes don't bother me -- but some of the bits included require a bit more skill than your average person has. What if no one in your production can play the accordion? Or the piano? Or balance a ladder on his chin? And while I enjoyed learning to make balloon animals for &quot;The Complete History of America,&quot; who the heck do you call to teach you how to juggle flaming torches? Still, it really is a fun script and I only wish I had the opportunity to watch these guys perform it in person.	2001-10-16

It sent Batman down a path even more guilt-ridden than his previous one and eventually led to the creation of a real balancing force in Tim Drake, the current (and best) Robin. Although the gimmick of allowing readers to call in and vote for letting Jason Todd live or killing him off seems sort of callow, it did gain this story serious attention, attention that it deserved. However (and perhaps this is the DVD fan in me) I feel sort of a pang of guilt that we've never seen the alternate ending for this story, the one where Jason survived. DC had both endings ready to go to the printer, just waiting for the response to come in... is there any reason we couldn't have included that alternate chapter in this collection? Heck, even if they stuck an &quot;Elseworlds&quot; label on that chapter, it would be fine with me. Something to consider, DC, the next time this book goes to print.	2001-10-10

This is THE definative work on The Joker as a character, and even if Moore didn't have masterworks like &quot;Watchmen&quot; under his belt, this book would mark him as a comic book genius.	2001-10-03
