She gives an insightful introduction to Freud that is well referenced. However, her style is absolutely monotonous and was far more difficult to complete than Freud's writing which was to follow. What Crick has done well with this version is that she has retained certain significant or vague tests in German (original) with their translations as parentheses, footnotes, or explantory notes. She has also added value to the version with an extensive package of explanatory notes after Freud's work. In addition, her translation of Freud's work \\"captures the lightness and pace of Freud's style, freed from the jargon and Victorian elaborations of James Strachey's famous version.\\" <br /> <br />On Freud's work itself, The Interpretation of Dreams was a revoluationary paper of its time, discussing for the first time, concepts such as the Oedipus complex and the practice of psychoanalysis. Freud explores his personal life with this paper, enriching the reader with his self-analyses. However, I felt he over did the case studies, presenting several examples of a single concept, which was for me perhaps a little long-winded and tiring to read, especially if his first examples were good ones, and presented the concept/s acutely. <br /> <br />The pace of the paper picks up at the start of each new concept and tends to wind down and even drag at the middle or end portions. Towards the end however, his pace dramatically picks up (and no, it's not a placebo effect), as he summarises and pulls all his concepts together in an attempt to hold on to the reader and deliver his final call to action. Overall this is an outstanding read that delivers esteemed perceptivity to the faculty of psychoanalysis, how we perceive and interpret the arts and literature, and on the variety of complex languages with which we do so. However, be prepared for an intense read, but remain assured that upon completion of this work, you will be duly facinated, inspired, and impelled to re-examine your psyche.	2005-05-03

Sure it misses out one or two species for some families, but it's hard to have a complete guide to the reef - it's too diverse. <br /> <br />It has one of the most complete guides to cartilaginous fish, pipefish, butterfly fish, groupers, damsels and wrasses, as far as I am aware, but it certainly has the most complete guide to gobies. <br /> <br />Colours for some species may be a little bit inaccurate, but then again, everything looks different in or out of water, and varies with visibility and health. It's not that big an issue. <br /> <br />Something else that's handy: pointers on the slate that highlight distinctive markings. <br /> <br />A good buy. You'd want to waterproof this.	2005-04-17

With photographs of an exquisite quality, not a single image is sub-standard making for a clear depiction of every animal - coral or critter. For photographers, this book also includes a handy \\"Ideal lens\\" note with each image. <br /> <br />Take note though that is a photographic guide, and not quite a field guide, so don't expect too much information on species and varieties or sites, but there is an informative and interesting note built of a paragraph or two, that is attached with each image. <br /> <br />This book has a good, though not complete, coverage of cowries, nudibranches, and scorpionfish - probably the more common species and varieties which you are likely to encounter. Half the book then presents the marine environment by zonal distinction, i.e. sandy weed and rubble, which really covers all creatures from snails, cones, eels, and other invertebrates and gastropods. <br /> <br />Most of the animals featured in this book are macrolife, so don't expect images of pelagics, baitballs and coral scapes.  <br /> <br />While it claims it is a guide of the Indo-Pac region though, I feel it would is a better guide to the zone between Indonesia and Micronesia, otherwise known as the triangular hotspot of biodiversity.	2005-04-17

And I'm quite sure any Kiwi birder would agree with that. My review is of the revised edition of this book [ISBN 0670-89370-6].  <br /> <br />This most certainly is the most complete guide to the birds of NZ with beautiful and accurate slates. I love its neat layout - slates on the right, description and ID on the left. There are no spill overs so its as simple as that. Where necessary, there are distribution diagrams with a detailed key which makes for very effective guide.  <br /> <br />Because NZ birds are so unique, you will love the additional Handbook section which introduces the different genuses. This comes after the field guide, at the back of the book. Everything is very detailed and you can tell that this book has been crafted with alot of attention and care. Which must be why this is the only field guide to NZ birds officially endorsed by the Ornithological Society of NZ. <br /> <br />A downside may be that it's a little bulky to haul around the field, but using it is such a joy that this short coming is quickly compensated. <br /> <br />The book for any self-respecting and serious birder, and an indispensible resource for naturalists or the curious amateur.	2005-04-17

As with all of Suu Kyi's books, she takes care to not forget why her party is fighting for democracy - its people.  <br /> <br />She discusses Burmese politics sans the jargon, allowing this book to be appreciated by everyone, even if new to the situation in Burma. <br /> <br />She included in her writings, several wonderful quotes from English, Japanese and Burmese poems, reflecting her regard of the arts. The title 'Letters from Burma' more than merely states the intention of each of the 52 entries in this book. Her entries are personal, light-hearted, frustrated, or balanced. They are addressed to the reader, bringing him/her into the world of Burma, and seeing it as it is for a lay person. <br /> <br />She has managed to make getting aquainted with politics so beautiful and enjoyable, through which i suppose she nurtures the concern and interest in matters of her state, that you are likely to re-read certain entries, if not the whole book again once you're through it.	2004-12-06

The outcomes of both choices are ambiguous. He has to decide sacrificing love for the betterment of his people, or sacrificing his people for the freedom to love. <br /> <br />To put it an oxymoron, his task is clear yet cryptic.  <br /> <br />I feel anyone will be able to relate to the story of Elijah. Paulo Coelo brilliantly plays the movement of the mind in lifes immanent decision-making processes. And while in the middle of the book (I cannot reveal what happened..) you may begin to oddly feel the cynicism of life which we all encounter at some point, however, following Elijah through his journey turns out to be be quite the opposite. <br /> <br />Beautifully constructed, Paulo Coelho reminds us of how he has mastered form and function in his writing. It seems funny that I even mention that because he IS a master in his field. But when you close this book, you will be reminded of powerfully he has been able to move your mind, and perhaps even, your heart and spirit as well. <br /> <br />	2004-11-09

Golding is a visionary, as with several of his likes - Huxley and Orwell et al, creating a scenerio that might appear to most, so clich&eacute;, so meaningless, yet undeniably profound. children, indulge in the mundane - play mostly; or so it is thought. Golding uses children, the root and beginning of each human existence to express civil and social evolution, perhaps even communisim and democracy, leftist and rightist attitudes. justice and injustice. his presentation may be basic, but such are our origins. this is a throughly entertaining, thought provoking and undeniable classic of our time.	2004-02-29

This can do a few things for you: agree further, become puzzled and choose to stick with what you thought before you read his book, or just heck it all because it all sounds rediculous to you.<br />It is likely that if you pick up this book you're either already Darwinian in thought or the opposite, and are looking for statements or whole chapters to rebutt. But whether you're with or against Dawkin's, he will push you to a corner, strap you down with sarcasim and offense (if you disagree with him, because he really doesn't think you should) or give you some positive stroking and nurture your understanding even more - which is highly entertaining.<br />i will not go into the details of his book because that's all part of why you would buy it - to make your own discoveries.<br />This is a throughly enjoyable book that you would like to keep for future references (to antagonise creationists). Dawkins also offers some carefully placed and very apt reflections of some blatently riduculous but proliferate and mostly condoned ideologies of our specicist, passive and conformist society - which you might love or hate, sometimes even though you may be with him most of the time.<br />A scientific and journalistic masterpiece which even Darwin would rise from the grave to throw his two cents.	2003-11-22

Otherwise, if you're planning a trip to the part of SEA (that excludes Indonesia) this is a worthy book to have with you. Though if you're planning trips to specific territories, I'd suggest you buy the relevent country's guide.	2003-04-18
US	35514729	R1RCOMG14WC9TM	0691114943	463271874	A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Southeast Asia: Including the Philippines and Borneo (Princeton Field Guides)	Books	2	20	21	N	N	Not the book for the serious birder	While it is nice to see the birds in the flesh with real-life pictures of them, it is certainly not pratical for use in the field.<br />Some of the pictures are poorly taken and it is highly difficult if not impossible to identify certain birds. Some of the images are back-lit, giving a silhouette of the bird!<br />There is no proper classification and very little info given of the birds - how the juveniles look like, breeding plumage, male/female plumage etc.<br />I suppose it is a good book for the casual birder who would like to know what's chirping outside his apartment window or chalet in the wilderness. It also comes with some interesting information on where to go birding to catch wetland or passerine birds etc.<br />I must commend Strange though for all his efforts into going into the field to capture these pictures - all pictures in the book were taken by Strange - good job Strange!	2003-04-18

Perera's debut 'A Leap in the Dark' is an undaunted contribution to Singaporean literature.<br />His use of vivid and figurative language seemingly cloak his philosopical insights into Singaporean society. For example I would describe that his use of sexual imagery propagates the organic relationship between the Singaporean and the issues  that Perera puts forth in this novella. Such is rationalised by Walt Whitman, \\"Sex must be brought out of concealment into the open in order to foster a sane, healthy attitude toward the important phases of life\\", and I think Perera is deserving of this relation.<br />Though I found his poems, which were interjected between his short stories, coming a little abrupt as as a reader I'd have to adjust the momentum and mood of my reading, I find A Leap in the Dark an explicit as well as implicit portrayal of Singaporean and other authoritarian-run societies.	2003-04-18
