US	52810435	R2CWFK1HXCCLYP	0452270073	779881568	Regeneration	Books	5	2	2	N	N	For the series	I read the trilogy a few years ago after seeing it on the front page of amazon.uk. I had a grandfather who was in the great war. He was gassed. He later committed suicide in the front room of his house by refusing food. We don't talk about it much. I am disturbed when I think of this war shattered man who I am related to over a gap of 50 years. <br /> <br />I found this series uplifting, sad, funny and enjoyable. I felt that I understood more about my family - what happened to us and why. The prose is wonderous, the dialog good enough that you feel suspended in the room or on the battle field with these people, just as if you were behind the furniture or sitting in the trench nearby. Its about poetry, rebellion and death. Its about the horror of this world. Also it is about being human.	2005-07-05

I've always been something of a tomboy. So as a girl I found great comfort in Nausicaa; she followed her heart and therefore I could follow mine. Maybe we were both weird, but we were noble, kind and graceful.<br />I love the manga, but my love remains with the moving picture version of Nausicaa - I think that so much is said in the animated version that is more subtle than pen and ink. I also disagree that the manga is equivalent to a novel - there really is not that much exposition overall. The drawing is wonderful, the format of the best quality. It is a graphic novel and as such belongs in that category to be compared with other graphic novels.<br />My minor criticism of the graphic novel is that I had hoped to find out more about Nausicaa's companions. However, the plot remains pretty stubbornly focused in either the apocalyptic past or in the present with the princess. I would have loved to have known how Yupa came by his exceptional swordsmanship or what Rastel's life was like.<br />What the graphic novels do well is expand wonderfully upon the soul of Nausicaa - her determination, her compassion and her willingness to contradict herself. She is not a super hero - she cannot see what effect her actions will have. She can only act as one who feels for those around her, even those who have lost their essential humanity. She never gives up on anyone, and that is a quality that all of us should strive for.	2004-02-07

While I found American Gods a bit overdone, I adored Stardust for its clearly faceted and sharply written prose and I love Neverwhere for its enjoyable setting, entertaining characters and plot speed.<br />That being said, I don't hate American Gods and still recommend it, but Neverwhere in my opinion is the more enjoyable ride.  I do recommend visiting the London Underground as a primer - it really is its own world down there; I have great childhood memories of looking out the window of the train and seeing little vignettes of the subterranean world flash by in shades of green and red and sketchy black. That's probably why I thorougly enjoyed this read!<br />It is a true fantasy on the order of Alice in Wonderland, or the Matrix or any of the 'step through the gate' type tales stretching back for god knows how many centuries. It is the kind of fairyland your grandmother knew about - not all fairies are nice...that's why you wear a charm :-). The two villians who are hunting for the protagonist are truly nasty AND hugely funny too (mmm rats)!<br />So if you want a modern-grit, fast plotted, fun fantasy novel, pick this one up!	2003-12-18

In my reading adventures, when I skip pages or scan-page, its a sign that though the basic plot is interesting, an editor might have been a good idea.<br />There were just too many things going on. He could have plotted the whole thing in the 'perfect' little town on the lake and it would have been interesting and a tight story - I would have cared more about the characters. Instead, we get a hugely rambling dustbunny of a story that meanders between mythic road trips, horror and philosophy. It succeeds in some places and fails in others.<br />For anyone with a basic interest in mythology or folk tales, the characters were pretty obvious. It was easy to see what Gaiman was up to. However, some of the best parts of the books were the little 'mini novels' within the book telling how different beliefs got to america - I think I found them satisfying because the main book was not providing much movement or closure.<br />Also, I cannot take the characters at their word that there were no gods in america before the old-worlders came.<br />It took me about a week to finish this one. Though I did not at any point feel the urge to drop it, I didn't feel my usual drive to complete. So a mediocre work from Mr. Gaiman - his first book I felt this way about.	2003-10-23

The book flows wonderfully, blending a series of well-known myths, children's tales and YGMFL (your grandmother's folklore) into a very fine story that also reflects upon real life. It is a small book and a quick read, but I've found myself reaching for it and reading a few pages at random since it is so enjoyable; there are very few books in my library that I can say this about - most of my paperbacks I resell or lend out to friend never to see again, but not this one. Also, the shortness does not at all diminish the feeling of a journey and an adventure.	2003-06-30

She does her best to dispell the myth of the 'genius'dog and the other myth of the 'border collies are black and white and stick thin small dogs'. <br />As an owner of a mostly white border collie, who is sometimes dismayed by people's comments about 'well she must have (insert breed) in her to be white', it is heartening to see pictures of every possible shade and shape of border collie. Border collies are very diverse - that's because the emphasis is (until recently, some may say) on a working dog, not a certain 'look'. It's their quirky minds that make them so different. A few hours with an obsessive fly chaser and you'll understand :-) <br />She has great sections on puppies, activities for your BC and lots of history and opinion. Some of the information may rub people the wrong way - bc people tend to be opinionated!	2003-03-06

My other gripe is that she jumps around a bit in her life time - so one chapter she talks about being the only woman on an expedition, and then she is the 1990's leader of NOAA and then we are back to her childhood haunts and back again.<br />That being said, it is a good read, full of facts and history. She worked in the sciences back when women were uncommon in the field. Back when there was no scuba gear and Jacques Cousteau was in to spear fishing, not conservation. Interesting stories, indeed! So, if you want an account of oceanography, past and present, its extreme limits and cool equipment from a personal point of view, pick this one up.	2003-01-24

I don't have many problems with my pair of dogs, but I like to think I can spot new issues and head them off pretty quickly - she gave me more signals to watch and more tools for dealing with the issues.<br />She has interesting ideas about group naming and group commands. Good advice for when another dog is being added to an already extant group of dogs - she also differentiates between an adult and a puppy - which are accepted differently by dog society.<br />Great pointers on when play is play, play is 'powerplay'and when to stop the powerplay from becoming a fight. My dogs can play rough and sometimes I am aware that it is becoming a grudge match - it was nice to have someone say that its alright to break it up and you DON'T have to let them 'sort it out'(sometimes I just don't want to listen to 15 minutes of growling and banging around during the 'play herding' phase). I find after a couple times that I have stopped the 'powerplay' that they seem to be playing more politely/quietly because they know that I am watching and ready to tell them 'go bed'.	2002-11-25

I've re-read several parts. <br />I was working with my dear old 7 year old BC-X last night - she's very mellow, a good girl who my trainer said would do anything for me if I knew how to tell her, but I've always had problems grooming her; she just curls into a hard ball of muscle that is impossible to brush (and believe me, she can hold that position for hours if it will get her out of something she doesn't like). <br />Just by reading this book I extrapolated a better approach - I tend to stand over her and get frustrated - the pitch of my voice changes as I whine repeatedly at her to stand up.<br />So I took out the vocal commands and used body language. I sat on the floor with my back towards her (this made her instantly curious). She came to me and I was able to brush her, give her a treat and praise her. I only made her hang out for a few minutes at a time, but by the end of the evening, I had given her a complete brushing without any curling up, cringing or pathetic shivering.<br />Next challenge: Nail Clipping.	2002-10-10

It is a holy book, and these are the nice bits - like reading the song of solomon in the bible and using those poetic passages to wholly judge western culture.<br />Truth is that the cultures that hold the Qur'an as their holy books are not very nice to their women, minorities or to people who are different. Punishment is harsh and intolerance is the rule. Creativity is not encouraged - as an artist I could not make a living in most middle eastern countries. I GET that Mohammad probably did not want his people to use his holy words that way (any more than Christ would have approved of the Crusades), but this is not how it has worked out.<br />I resent any holy text being pushed on anyone in any school anywhere. Perhaps a recommended reading list - many students are curious anyways. It should be a choice whether it is the bible, the qu'ran or the bhagavad gita. They are all great literature and give us windows into other's cultures, but it should always be a choice.<br />It is good reading and nicely done. Read it if you have chosen to read it as I have.	2002-09-03

I finished it in 3 hours with a cup of tea and a scone. If you want to get into theological arguments over a summer book, I think its a big waste of time. It is pretty well written and the characters are good enough that I cried a couple times.<br />However, there was material here for a longer book with more plotting and deeper characterization - the plot is pretty linear. I also wished that there had been a bit more justice in this book, but then I am a long time reader of murder mysteries...so I kept expecting the detective to figure something out.<br />Lots of fun and should be read for fun. The ending was a bit much and I would have preferred for the protaganist to be more 'hands off'. If I had a second chance on earth, I don't think I would have done what she did, but hey...its a summer novel!	2002-09-03

It feels like a 'quota book', as if a book publisher said \\"Hey Terry, you promised us a book this year...\\". It probably was nothing like that, but it seems like the author took characters from previous books, renamed them and stirred and then didn't sharpen his satire and wit on a proper whetstone.<br />The topic is dying for good satire, but this didn't strike a cord with me. I still laughed at a lot of things and heck, I'll take a Pratchett book any day over just about any other novel. However, I have re read most of Terry's books over the years, but I have never picked this one up again.<br />Start with the gaurds series, the witches series or the rincewind series - any of those will give you a good laugh and a good push into diskworld!	2002-07-26

They walk among us or cruise in limosines, they politic and backstab and they decend into insanity.<br />More than anything I am reminded of Frankenstien - true, the Island of Dr. Moreau might be more pertinent, but the very earliest thoughts of the modern era about what it might mean to make artificial life are echoed here in bold. Will these creations of ours be better than us? More brutal? Kinder? Or will they be just like us; unwilling to let go of the chains of power, unwilling to ask for help and keeping secrets to the bitter end? Do we as humans even have the right to create new beings, or does it require the mind of an insane person to execute on this dream?<br />The book is ultimately very sad and sweet at the same time. It is very apparent that it is a first work - the author has a few problems expressing herself, but this is overtaken by her driven prose and obvious zeal for the story.<br />Wonderful, unforgetable characters. I'll never forget the historian.	2002-06-06

I think some of the advice was not that good - especially the 'just throw a handful of food in there' one (disaster in a very small pond...even in mine with very good filtration).

What is is it with people, why does breeding matter? Yep, she probably has some border collie in her, but she cannot/will not herd (she is stubborn) and hates chasing balls and frisbees - she ain't no stinking border collie.<br />Oh well, it is nice to have this book for some mutt pride. Yeah, there is not a purebred in my house - but I have this in common with most american families! My dog is known as 'white dog' in this book - and that's enough for me!	2002-05-02

The translation I read in college was pure torture, with a stiffness/stuffyness/fussiness that could not have possibly reflected the original epic. It must have been something like this translation, how else would it survive all these milennia if it did not at some time hold one's interest?<br />I gave it 4 stars because there are only so many descriptions of how many ships, countries, how many troops and how many animals were cut up and burned that I can read before I start skipping when I see them starting and repeating over and over again (and skipping did not detract if you are not interested in Greek sacrifice techniques or who was who's brother or the son of which minor god).<br />It is a true novel of war.

Avoid the falcon press book on doggy packing - it's pretty durn lame and very short. This book does have basic factoids like how much you can expect your dog to carry, how much water to bring, proper tethers, dog booties,proper trail etiquette (yes, the dog is ON THE LEASH),etc. <br />She understands that the way the public sees people who hike with dogs is up to each of us - I have had the displeasure of being pounced on in the wilderness by a dog - I instantly had a bad impression of the hikers who called him back. Also, dogs left alone barking at camp - take your dog with you! It's so mean to leave the poor dog alone in a strange place anyways - I'd bark too! This is what gets trails and camps closed to those of us who are responsible!<br />So if you want to be a responsible 'dog packer' read this book and follow her advice. <br />See you on the trail!	2002-02-21

If you have ever worked with a submissive dog (both of mine are submissive) you will immediately find that growling, scruffing and rolling them over will get you no where but ankle deep in a puddle of urine.<br />However, working directly with your dog and being social with your dog is the way to train them. Dogs have evolved and been transformed by us to work (and play) - the ultimate reward for many dogs is the act of work itself - a herding dog gets its kudos from chasing livestock, my dog gets hers from being with me and accompanying me everywhere - the motivation is social and no food or operant conditioning is needed.<br />This book gives you a new appreciation of the dog as a species and as part of human culture - for they are ultimately a product of mankind and like us are brilliant and flawed, trapped in their instincts as much as we are in our presuppositions about the dog.<br />My only negative feedback for the book is that the authors did not go very deeply into their central theory of dog evolution and some of the chapters on learning and comparisons of dog types (herders vs village dog vs sled dogs) were shallow - I would have enjoyed reading more!<br />Regardless, this book will remove some of the sentimentality and restore the reality of the dog in your mind. I certainly appreciate my dog that much more for reading this book.	2001-06-18

Nice book with a limited scope, I recommend it for the concise descriptions and general tendencies of the dogs listed. I have to laugh at some of the stereotypes for many of the breeds, though!<br />I have met alot of dogs. A couple were from breeds recommended as happy family dogs or as dogs who don't mind apartments in this book. These same dogs in real life avoided children and were unhappy in small spaces and were the gallopers at the park (gentle, docile???).  <br />I own a border collie who is five years old. Yes, she is active, but she is also sweet, minds her commands and was happy to live in an apartment with no yard. I took her to work with me and she slept under my desk most of the day.<br />So my advice to folks looking for a dog or a breed - go out and meet a dog - they are all individuals - if you love herding dogs but have limited space, look out for the sheep-chaser who is also mellow and sweet! They are out there if you just look - and some of them are at rescue societies and shelters.<br /> Likewise, if your dream breed is from one of the supposed family breeds, be rigorous, don't just assume that because of pedigree that the dog will be just right - that is how the dog ends up at the rescue society and shelters.<br />Lastly, don't reject a dog who is right there in front of you and is great and wonderful just because she comes from a 'hard' breed! I know of a Chow Chow who just kinda landed in an aquaintance's life - she was scared because of the Chow's reputation, but the dog has turned out be kind of an all in one living blanket, pack animal (carries stuff on hiking trips) and child entertainment system. Of course, Cheno is an unusual Chow, but he's also a unique dog!	2000-12-15

The story was great, and despite the somewhat labored(ok, amatuerish, but sweet)writing I really enjoyed it. <br />Credibility and the claim of a true story is another issue entirely. For instance, Modoc is described as having  tusks a foot long,but none of the photos in the book show the tusks. Did  she have a tusk removal or did she have folding swiss army tusks? Certainly  both of the characters existed, but the absence of dates, documentation and  decent photographs (and please,a map!) make this book a work of creative  fiction in my eyes.	1999-09-22

It is a work of multilayered artistry to be appreciated from the spiritual to the fantastic.  It's also fun and unlike most of  Pratchett's books you actually care about most of the characters.  Reads  well out loud as well. Like many readers here, I see it as the author's  pinnacle, the book that he will be remembered for.  Here's to immortality,  Mr. Pratchett!	1999-06-15
