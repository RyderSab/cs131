A friend of mine told me that there are plays and operas based on Rusalka. Depending from different parts of Russia, Rusalka is a ghost with past different mythologies & varieties of powers. Well, Ms. Cherryh create a great fantasy based on the concept of a Rusalka. <br />  <br />The intorduction of the book is fast paced where one the the characters, Pyetr falsely accused of something and the village wants him dead. Along the way, he gets unexpected help from a wet behind ears teenage boy and escape the village of Vojvoda.  <br />Pyetr learns a little bit more about his new companion, tries to portray the real harshness of life & squash fairy tales of magic. Pyetr getting weak & near death they fortunately meet the likelihood of Uulamets. Uulamets a proud wizard in own right does something that is believe that can't be done. The trio soon become somewhat of a family when a new chartacter, Eveshka comes into the mix. Don't want to give away to much but this a great read especially for a book that was written sometime in the 80's.	2005-09-10

Originally, I read part 2 of this series first. When I first read this book I had to re-read part 2 again. I say in it self that each book can stand alone, that's what part two did for me. This is the humble but aristocratic orgins of who we call the golden one. Ampris born a slave, stolen from her mother & brought up in the ways of the privilige Viis. The King of the Viis or the Kaa, his daughter wanted Ampris as her pet. As Ampris grows up she come across with conflicts with her own identity and her place in society. As the book continues she feels she is just more than a pet & more of a slave. Later, she crosses path with another character of the book Elrabin is also shown as a seperate story. Eventually, when they end up meeting in the end which somehow, in part two, thier friendship is very crucial & neccessary to the series.    I've read the other reviews of how people got confuse with the Lucasfilm logo thinking its a Star Wars book. I always saw the logo and never got any confusion thinking it has something to do with Star Wars. Lucasfilms has done alot more than just Star Wars and this series prove it can go outside the Star Wars Universe. This series is very entertaining and originally in my book. I find it rare that some books like all the books in this series get any type of attention which I believe it should. This is an excellent read. Also, it's excellent find if anyone come across with any of the books in this awesome triology. Deborah Chester is an awesome writer and I'm looking foward to read more books by her.	2005-09-07

When I go to the libray I see Tad Williams books but I often ignore them because the books seem so huge. It seem like every book he writes has 1000 pages. so one day, I was in a hurry try to find a book to read especially to kill some for a couple of days to keep me busy. I felt this would be a great choose. To my surprise this story was NOT an outlandish run of the mill crazy sci-fi magical overkill. In the begining the main character Theo Vilmos was a basic dude with real problems. Williams made the character goes through what almost every guy goes throuh sometime in their life. So, it was easy to connect to the character. Then one magical moment after reading several pages that his grandfather had wrote. His life had changed with a fairy. Huh?? From this point one it get quorky, humorous and very entertaining. This book is an interesting find.	2004-12-03

I'm not a theologist or a docturine of religion. I'm a person who has many questions. I had a strict up bringing in the non denomination faith of christianity. As an adult I felt that I was programmed to be a certain way because of what I was taught when I was younger. In my search I read many books in the matter of religion to find answers for my questions. In this book Zacharias had some valid points that I agreed with and some that I didn't. In the introduction of the book I felt the author felt so convicted that his message must be heard. He challenges Deepak Chopra who I feel had a great impact in my life through his books and cds. In a way I felt a little threatened but he made some valid points. I did questioned some of Chopra teachings. He makes excellent and valid points about Jesus Christ which I feel that there is no arguement there. What I truely focused on was when he pointed out that the physical and spiritual hungers must be satisfied without violation of each other to be true fulfilled. How can one be fulfilled if one were raised up to believe what one was taught is to be absolute truth. Then sometime in your life someone else come tells you something different. Do you question it or ignore it. I felt I was lucky enough to question it? Many people have thier own understanding to their own spirituality. Many may come to question? I feel that there is no defenitive line. In this book,I know many will truely disagree with me. I almost felt that in his own sutle way he is excalating his point as a hardcore fanatic. In other words if you're not a born again christian. You will never reach the gates of heaven.	2004-12-03
US	52567145	R2ZECNWZGFWIVE	0316603570	335598141	3rd Degree	Books	4	5	7	N	N	And the Saga continues	I would like to say that Patterson had to do something traumatic with in this third part of this series to make my jaw drop. I'm surprised he did, which I felt was necessary. In a way, I felt it was predictable but I had to read it for myself. You'll understand what I mean if you read the book. I hate giving away certain details when I make a review. Even though, I like Patterson, I always felt that there was something within this series that was missing or lacking. The Women's Murder club reminds me of a rundown wanna be TV show that would show up on a weekly basis that I would care less about watching. I always was stuck in the middle of trying to give each book of this trilogy 3 or 4 stars. But, I end up giving a 4 star anyway. Patterson's writing is concise and to the point, which I like because his books are easy for me to read at work. Most other books it really needs my full attention. I had said this in the past and I'll say it again. Patterson is a great storyteller!! He has a strange knack of keeping your full attention when it comes to story telling. He his one of the many authors I keep track of on a regularly basis, even though, he writes a totally different genre that I'm normally like.	2004-06-09

Not because of his writing, it because he knows how to capture the imagination. I think its great that Patterson went a different direct than his normal genre of writing. Among friends, when discussing Patterson novels, we have a saying of normal Patterson, which is mostly detective/suspense or weird Patterson, which is out of the norm for us. This book is out of the norm. I feel in this book that he's just a great storyteller. Even though, I feel that some of the slang and words used weren't authentic of the time era. I imagined someone sitting down in front of an audience telling a story through his owns words. The story beings with archaeologists finding a relic from the past and with this relic a historical fictional story unfolds. The time era was in 1096 with the main character Hugh de Luc feels he must fight for freedom of his people. He leaves his wife behind and his quest begins. Through out the book Hugh is faced with pain staking realizations and no matter what had happened he had a lot of passion and heart. He had true beliefs in the goodness of things even though horrible things had happened to him. He continues to press on and the strange thing was that the thought of giving up never crossed his mind. Even though, there were many people around him giving much doubt, he still believed!! I felt Patterson (with some help of course) captured the true essence of that. Now, if an author can do that he is a great writer within his own class!!	2004-06-09

Orbis was the first but I feel I like Orbis alot better!! Mr Mackay has a habit of putting you in the middle of the story, even though you don't know what the heck is going on, you are wanting to find what more of what is happening!! The main character Alex Denyer, a scientist, is being put through the most craziest situations that I, myself, couldn't phanthom going through. There were times I felt for the character. <BR>Originally, in the begining, I thought I knew who was the villian in this book, then Mr Mackay did a twist on me, then later on he did another twist and I realized I should stuck to my original guess. I felt Mr Mackay did a great job writing about the relationships Alex had with the other characters like his ex-wife & her new husband, his son and ex-girlfriend. There wasn't much action going maybe near the end. I felt the author wanted this book to be written by a scientist point of view. Like for example, if this happen to a scientist what would he do in this situation. No bang, bang shoot up type of violence happening here. In this case, it honesetly work for me!!	2004-04-07

To be honest, I feel this book isn't a big thriller but I can actually see this happening in real life. This novel is one of the truely unique compelling stories among Patterson's other works. This book doesn't contain pyshco serial killers on the loose and super sleuths on the heels of his trail. This story is about a death of a young man, Peter who lived among the rich and his brother Paul is trying to find out what really happened to him. Did he really commit suicide or was there foul play involved. When Paul tries to discover the truth it seems like he can't win because the rich are powerful especially in high places and have enough money to make sure Peter's murder was a cover-up. Paul being trained in law himself feels he can't win because of the justice system. He felt that the judicial system had failed him. Previously at an inquest concerning Peter's death. The main suspect named Barry Neubauer who may have been involved mentioned the attorney general's name and the judge declared Peter's death was a suicide. Paul feels he has to goes to drastic measures to have his brother murder's solved. He kidnaps all the people he knows were involved and setup an hodge podge court room and air it live so the whole world can see the truth especially with the evidence that he found. There were parts I may find questionable but hey this is Patterson if you just go along with it. You'll find yourself truely entertained.	2004-03-21

I was mildly entertained when I read it and I would never buy this book. Good thing I went to my local library. I found this book a bit odd, quorky, far-fetched &amp; cartoonish at times. I found it strange that a fantasy book had alot of modern influences I thought was interesting and passed as believeable. For example, drug dealers that sold a drug called Dwa and Diplomatic Immunity for an Orc. The main character made it well known that he has a low self-image of himself. To top it off, he's over weight and in his late forties. Through out the book he was always hot and wanted a beer. It was hard to image Thraxas skillful using a sword against certain opponents that were faster that him. There were times I caught myself chuckle at certain parts. A good asset to the book was Thraxas's friend Makri. She was a young hot ex-gladiator wearing a bikini serving ale at the Avenging Axe most of the time. She wasn't a no brains all braun type of girl, basically she was both brains and braun. The 2nd part of the book Thraxas and the Warrior Monks was a bit more to my liking. I found it redundant that it recalled events from the first part of the book. Originally, there were sold as two seperates books. Honestly, I would never read this book again, but hey, I was entertained!!	2004-03-14

This book remind me of the old Patterson & how he use to SHOCK and WOW the heck out of you. Now Alex is in the FBI he's called the \\"FNG\\", in other words \\"The F****ng New Guy.\\" Even though he's a very experienced and a famous cop, he still has to start from the bottom and work his way up. He get's no special treatment. He's on a case which involves slavery of beautiful well to do women. This mysterious Wolf is behind it all. I was mostly shocked because I didn't expect certain outcomes especially when his baby's mother come back into the picture. That was some pretty heavy drama happen there. But there was one thing I didn't like in the book. If you shot someone point blank with a rocket laucher wouldn't you die or get affect by the blast. Well, other than that, I was truely entertained and I felt Patterson should stay to his roots of writing a great suspenseful novel.	2004-03-07

The sentence read: &quot;I was casted out of my village at age 11.&quot; I was like &quot;WHAT!!!&quot; What the heck did she do that was so horrible?? The book read as if it was an autobiography of a fictional character. To be honest, just by reading the title of the book. I was expecting crazy violence and how she would learned special techniques of ancient fighting ninja ways. This book turned out to be something unexpected. Lale the main character was an unwanted child taken in by villagers that cared less about her. As the story progress she becomes fortunate in certain turn of events. I found it strange that I was learning every aspect of her life as if she was truly a real person. This novel isn't a true fantasy novel, there were fantasy elements due to there was a sorceress using magical wraiths as a form of control. Other than that it was like a drama unfolding a decietful well thought out plan for unfortunate Lale. When Lale finds out the truth about of her life she had an unexpected ally and an unexpected villian. This story is truely well written. I don't sense a sequel for Lale since the ending was truely a happy one &amp; why ruin a perfectly good story with a sequel anyway!!	2004-03-07

I wasn't sure what Mr Patterson was trying to do with Alex Cross in this book. Alex isn't sure if he's going to retire or not. I felt that in this book Alex was in a transition phase of retiring all together or going into the FBI. It started out by helping his friend Sampson on a case which invovled an innocent veteran friend of Sampson being accused of killing 3 women. The whole concept of the 3 blind mice was great. 3 Vietnam veterans that did rogue-ish activities in the war, committing gruesome crimes in the good of U.S of A and a mysterious fourth mice is doing heavy duty cover-up. Finally, Alex have a stable love life. I really got tired of Alex feeling like he's a person that can be hard to love because of his job. There needed to be a balance in his life. I felt Mr Patterson at times added insteresting elements to the story which were interesting but I felt had nothing to do with the book. Maybe he was trying to hint of certain things coming on the horizion in future books. There were times I felt certain parts were rushed especially near the ending. After reading this book I felt if I hadn't read any previous Alex Cross novels I would of cared less about this book.	2004-02-29

I almost gave this book 3 stars but the second half of the book made up for it. It took a long time to get into and just like the first book Magiere &amp; Leesil were still sort of bland until the second half of the book. The Hendees seem to have a habit of making the other characters stand out more especially the bad guys instead of Magiere and Leesil. There were some parts that were easily to predict especially if you read the first book. I knew Rayboy was in it. I knew he would create his own minions. I knew he would die. I knew one of his minions had to be smarter than him especially to escape the wrath of Magiere &amp; Leesil. The book almost went toward the repeat of their first novel. Like for instance, the new town they went to destroy the evil vampires was coastal. They had to deal with people of the counsel that didn't care about what was happening to their town. The first attack by Rayboy, now Toret, was in the inn were Magiere &amp; Leesil were at. Finally, there was fire involved, which burn the inn down. Up to this point, which by the way was almost half the book. I almost had enough and almost put the book down.<br />To my surprise, the book went in a total different direction. I was total hooked. There were alot of new surprises I didn't expect. I know the authors tried to make Magiere and Leesil mysterious so you as the reader want to know more about them but in my opinion they need to make Magiere and Leesil to have more depth. I liked the fact, there were Sages to support the duo or trio if you included Chap of course. There was a whole new aspect of Whiestel and it seems there is more to tell. I hope the third novel will get into gear with development Of Magiere and Leesil. I think it will because there was a huge revealment I didn't expect between the two.	2004-02-13

When I read this book, I felt that there was a gap between Nightmare and this book.   Kendi is a Father in the Childen of Ifran now, but in Nightmare he just started to get involved with them. Since the Despair being Silent is rare and Father Kendi is one of the well known heroes of the Despair. According to this novel 15 yrs had gone by. Character talked about the Despair and certain events that had happened. I was like huh....was there a novel called Despair. If there wasn't there should of been one. It just a little pet peeve of mine when authors leave huge gaps of time in between novels.<br />I must say even though there was a huge gap it was still an interesting story. Father Kendi is captain of a ship called Poltergeist on the search for the scattered Silent, right now, mostly on the look out for his family. In this book, Father Kendi is more confident than who he was in the past. He and his crew work together like a well oiled machine and get the job done. Steven Harper created unique ways for the characters to overcome certain obsticles especially when, ironicly, time well spent in the chocate factory and in trying to obtain the port keys. I might say myself was pretty ingenius. The author has way of keeping your interest afloat and I can say there were no dull moments at all!!	2004-02-10

This is the first book I read by Steven Harper and I was meserized. The whole concept of Silent in itself is mindblowing and it is very original. The main character Kendi is put through some emotional challenges where you total feel for him. The way the author portrayed Kendi makes you actually care for the character. The book starts out where Kendi and his family are broken up and sold into slavery. He and his mother being bought by the same owner did bring some comfort that he still has a family member with him but, it was short lived. As soon as he &amp; his mother were discovered that they were Silent, boy, did things had changed. From this point on you're hooked. I coulnd't wait to see what happened next. There was a turn of events when Kendi was a witness to a murder in the dream &amp; discovered that there was a serial killer on the loose. Now he was on the killer's hit list when the killings were primarilary women. The ending was a shocker!! I didn't expect the ending to end the way it did. As soon as I was done reading, I wiped the sweat from my forehead and said, &quot;Whoa, this is a great book!!&quot;	2004-02-10

The reason being my local library doesn't contain certain volumes. Even though, I started with this volume I felt as though I didn't miss a beat. When reading this book I felt that this world is waiting to be discovered and I have to say I'm proud to be one of the few that discovered it. Ms Chester has a unique way of drawing you in and wow, I felt like I was in entirely different universe which separated itself from anything out there. The whole infrastructure of the Viis empire and community was interesting. The Viis being superior to any race out there gave you an understanding of how Ambris felt. She felt supressed and seeking out a way for every race to feel equal. Even though she was a slave turned famous gladiator she stayed true to who she was and what she believed. No mattered what had happened to her especially when she gave birth to genetically experimented children she still believed in the greater good of things. Everything in this book shows how Debra Chester had great depth of knowledge of this universe. So now goes on my search for part one and part three.	2004-02-10

I say it somehow worked. A particular friend of mind thought this book was a rip-off of Blade with a fantasy twist. I beg to differ. To be honest, I particularly really cared the bad guys (Rashed and his gang) more than the main characters. To me, I felt that they had a passion of who they were and proud of it. I was totally mesmerized by them and thier past. Parts of me wished that they were the main charaters of the book. This is the first time I was rooting for the bad guys. Magiere &amp; Leesil's character development were a bit lacking. There were times when I could of cared less about them but they have potential to become better characters hopefully in the next book. I was very entertained. Barb &amp; J.C. Hendee did a good job in writing they're first novel and I'll be happy to read the next one.	2004-01-28

He gives us a brief explanation of the nine and what they had to do with the charter stones, which by the way, was truly unique.<BR>I truly love Lirael, she was a daughter of the Clayr who tried so desperately to have the sight. She didn't want to be a misfit because she was so unlike the other members of the Clayr. Garth really portrayed her character well. All in all, this book had pretty much keep up my interest.<BR>Now, my grips on the book. I hated the fact that this book totally took place 14 years into the future after Sabriel. We find out that Touchstone & Sabriel are now married with kids!!! What happened during the 14 years? Are we ever going to find out? I probably wouldn't be interest about what happened during the 14 years, but I hate to read books where favorite characters are talking about brief adventures that happened in the past that weren't in a published book. Another grip is the kids of Touchstone and Sabriel. Prince Sameth is a total wimp and his sister is a spoiled brat!! I totally hated reading about them especially Sameth until he meet up with Lirael in the end. He ended up being a different character but I still didn't like him. Other than my grips about this book I feel this is a good story and well written. I feel Garth Nix had a good Trilogy on this hands. Now, onward to Abhorsen the third book!!!	2003-06-08

For a book that's considered for children, I have to say that this book is a very excellent read!!! I feel this book borders the lines of semi-dark fantasy. I feel Garth Nix down played allot of scenarios due to it's considered a children's book. To be honest, this book is rated 4.5 stars due to the fact that it only 216 pages long & allot was left unexplained and unsaid. The ideas of Charter magic and Free magic is an excellent idea indicating it separating the old ways of magic and the new. Having the Old Kingdom divided by a wall to prevent dead and vile creatures such as a Mordicant to the New Kingdom implies that there are two separate almost alien worlds are working at hand here. The Old Kingdom has mostly dead roaming the land and free magic flows. The other where people are schooled in magic and having modern technology such as rifles and vehicles like trucks. From beginning to end you are definitely whisked away to an uncharted adventure. This book indeed has an excellent story to be unraveled. In the beginning of the story Abhorsen, Sabriel's father, came upon a group of villagers where a village woman give birth but the newborn died. Abhorsen had the magic ability of going to the gates of Death and bring the child back to life. Coming back from entering the gate of life he claims the child his own. Later in the story, Sabriel is looking for her father and sooner learns that she is having the difficulty to take on the burden of the title of Abhorsen, which in fact, she thought Abhorsen was her father's name and not a title. Don't want to give away any much more of the story but this book it truly unique and standing up to holds its own!!	2003-05-10

If an author like Patterson can entertain and add shock value to this genre of murder-mystery/suspenese he will always be the man in my eyes. I feel James Patterson has a formula of at least getting you interested then \\"BOOM!!!\\" shocks the heck out of you. This is the second novel I read to where the main character isn't a detective, I always thought that Mr Patterson had to have a detective as a main charcter, I guess, this is the second book that proved me wrong. This is a story about the victim Maggie then was twisted to accused killer Maggie, you were like what!! I wasn't sure what the heck she was. At times, I really thought she was the killer, then I kept changing my mind to that was a the victim the whole time. I feel most people that read Patterson's books and give a bad review simple just doesn't get his writing. I feel that James Patterson isn't writing for the greatness of great literature but for the entertainment of suspense.	2003-05-09

To be honest this is the first book I read by him. When I read this book I was flabbergassed that this book was written back in the early fifties. He was so ahead of his time!!! I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man. I know there are more to this series but after I read this book I felt I needed much time to absorb of what I just read because it was such a mind opening experience.	2003-05-09

I know this story is written back in 1979, it is a bit shakey and needed a little bit of fine tuning but other that that this book is great!! James Patterson is a great story teller and shocks the heck out of you in the end as always. This is the first book I read by Patterson were the main character isn't a detective. Patterson made you feel what David (the main character) felt and David wanted ultimate revenge on Nazis but in the end David realize revenge is not the best solution because it can lead you in the wrong direction like the Nazi Hunter did. The Nazi Hunter (who's name I forgotten) did the unbelieveable as he held up the olympics. I feel that James Patterson had the guts to write this story because what if this did happen in real life. I feel that Patterson breaks all the rules and boundaries in my eyes!!!	2003-05-09

The first 100 pages was a struggle. I feel F.M. Busby had good intentions to where he was trying to lead you to with this novel but I feel he not a great story teller at all. I read his previous novel Arrow from Earth which was fairly desent but this book had so much scientific gadets, lingo & mumbo jumbo that it was so easy to get lost!! The main character Sam Gowdy was plain and I didn't care too much for him. F.M. Busby needs alot of work on character development. There were some concepts & ideas were good that's why I gave this book a 2 but I would never recommend anyone this book to read for entertainment!!	2003-05-02

The book wasn't at all dull but it reminded me of how I feel towards The Conan the Barbarian and Alien movies. They weren't great excellent movies but they were still good. Well, that's how I feel towards this book. I love C.J Cherryh later works... this collection were her earlier works. In my opinion, I think, at that time she was trying to find her place in the writing world.<br />I believe the more she had written the better she got!! I think she is a great writer and knows how to executes her characters flawlessly. Her characters Morgaine and Vanye were complex, strange and unusal to understand. I feel thier relationhip was very complicated, if it wasn't, it wouldn't be a good story. This book was exciting at times but I feel somehow its still missing something!!	2003-04-17

In this book action speaks louder than words. There is always something happen to keep my interest afloat. Sekme the main character was a no hold bars female character who can hold her own. When I read this book I sensed that Katie Waitman must have gotten her ideas and influence from the middle-east. The sun, desert, bloodshed and a never-ending war I thought would be a little redundant like other sci-fi military fiction but the way Ms. Waiteman carry the story into the unknown was outstanding. This book wasn't predictable at all and Katie Waitman is a wonderful story teller.	2003-04-17

Regis the halfing is kidnapped by a an assassin Artemis Entreri. This novel is an exciting adventure of cat and mouse with Drizzt and the gang. Drizzt lost his statue of his mystical companion Guenhwyvar. It was interesting to see how would Guenhwyvar reacted within the hands of another master beside a drow. Artemis's employer Pasha Nook is his third owner. R A Salvatore threw Pirates, Demons, Dragons and everything into this adventure including the kitchen sink. It was amazing to see someone who was an equal to Drizzt when it came to a thrown down. I can read this part of the trilogy alone over and over again.	2003-04-12

In a way, Drizzt is implied as a member of Bruneor's family. Bruenor is on a quest to his centuries old birthplace of his known heritage Mithril Hall. The chemistry of all the chartacters are well protrayed. Drizzt, even though, in my opinion is the most powerful of the bunch is the key element of why this story is great.	2003-04-12

Nothing, in my opinion, can compare to how this charcter is portrayed. This book is about Drizzt from his birth to his exile. Learning about the drow society was amazing and the details of this culture seem so real. Nothing I ever read was so detailed about a culture that doesn't even existed. R. A Salvatore wrote about the sights and smells about Drizzt's birthplace Menzoberranzan which made you love and hate it at the same time. It made you understand about his evil heritage. Knowing that his race done things the way they done for centuries he finally feels conflicted. He also wonders if other drow were like him. Realizing that if you don't follow the way of the drow means ultimate death. Drizzt follows his heart and realize what he must do in order to survive.	2003-04-12

All I wanted to know was Who, What, When, Where and Why the Mastermind is all about and his true agendas!! In Roses are Red, James Patterson told you who the Mastermind was at the end of the book even though he decieved you a couple of times during the read. I felt he didn't have enough material about the Mastermind, so he included a story of vampire killings, maybe trying to throw you off the Mastermind. In this book there were a little twist but not enough to make your jaw drop like in his previous books. If your a Patterson fan I would buy the book if not just read this at the library...it much cheaper!!	2003-04-12

I think this book had a great plot and ideas but after reading the book I'd realized some of it was a bit chessy. James Patterson has a way of writing that when you read his books you are so involved that anything that you read might be ridiculous end up fitting into the story very well. The idea of two pregnant virgins of emaculation conception, one having the child of Christ and the other of Lucifer was, in my eyes, surprising!! To be honest, I feel the ending could of been better.

First I would like to say my deepest respects to the late Gordon R Dickson who passed away in 2001. He was a great author who created the whole splinter cultures of the spectaular universe that he had created. After reading Young Bleys, I had to know who this Hal Mayne was. To my surprise I see why Hal Mayne was a vital piece to the whole Dorsai, Exoctic and Friendly universe. His nemesis Bleys was a powerful (Other) individual and Hal Mayne was his equal. I think others may feel that read this book may be slow and detailed on some parts that could of been omitted but I feel alot of detailed aspects of Hal Mayne, I think, were interesting and crucial if you wanted to understand his character. The story starts out with Hal Mayne witnessing the deaths of his mentors and running away from the killers. While reading you'll see him growing from a boy to a man that he was destined to be. Gordon R Dickson is a great story teller with great ideas. I feel alot authors out there have great ideas but doesn't know how to tell a story or know how to tell a story but doesn't have great ideas. Sadly Gordon R dickson will be missed in my eyes. This book will always be a treasure to me!	2003-04-11

If we as humans don't believe in a god, somehow we create one to believe that there is something more out there. This book encourages spiritual awarness within all of us. I truely believe this book is fictional and this did not happen in factual accounts as the book is trying to imply. I believe James Redfield is trying to convey a message and the message is a powerful one. I feel he had to get his message across through an action filled fictional adventure. Like most of the stories of the bible is filled with action, lust and adventure. I'm not trying to compare this book to the bible but I think he got his idea based on the bible's formula of interest. This book is great for those who are searching for knowledge of the spirit and a spiritual awareness within.I believe life is a journey not a destination especially a journey of ones' spirit.	2003-04-11

The mother by the way is totally unware of the problem. Marnie goes to her father, who by the way isn't Captain of the ship yet, and he sneak here through the Hebegger gates. The Hebegger gates, one labeled \\"M\\" for mouth and the other labeled \\"T\\" for tush. Once you pass through the gate time speeds up. Marnie goes through gate \\"M\\" which leads to a starship that does space exploration and to top it off just by being on the ship for 2 months equals 4 earth years. During this time Marnie is discovered by the crew and the mother is on the hunt for her daughter, which lead her to the conclusion that her daughter must be on the starship Arrow with her ex-husband Clancey. Honestly, the book started great. I was curious and intriqued by the time I got to the middle of the book I started to lost interest. Anything that was about to happened was quickly short-lived! I think the author try to put the story into the views of a 12 yr old girl but it failed in my opinion. This book had alot of good ideas like the gates having to due with dimensions and that why time speeds up time. I feel this book is for the true hardcore sci-fi readers, but if you want some action this book doesn't have much as the summary in the back of the book suggested.	2003-04-03

This is book one of the whole series. This book was a good read and each story was written in thier own way by different authors. Honestly, I found some contridiction is the book but not enough to throw you off. I was surprise to find a story within the book written by Harry Turtledove. Now Harry Turtledove a known author, this must have be written before he became known. I wasn't excited by the book but if the book was written by one author I would of like it better. In my opinion, I feel that one author can truely project the true essence of a story.	2003-04-03

I must admit there is no reason for me to hate this book. Honestly, I hated Sundiver and Startide Rising, which by the way, I felt were a waste of time. In this book at least David Brin was very consistant and true to the story at hand. He didn't throw all these extra elements that had nothing to do with the book like in his previous novels. The four major players in this books were Robert Oneagle, a captian of a militia special forces and son of a planetary coordinator. Athaclena a Tymbrimi who's a shapeshifter with physic abilities. Fiben &amp; Gailet both chims (a chimpanzee race that was uplifted by humans.) In this book it was interesting to see that humans were &quot;NOT&quot; majors players and the whole Galatic counsel were aliens races. Athaclena a daughter of a Galatic diplomat discovers that humans were illegally uplifting gorillas added an element of surprise. Most of the Galatics feels the human race is infantile but they had uplifted chimps and dolphins before alien contact. So, there is a mystery on who uplifted the humans if the humans has uplifted thier clients and who is the humans' patrons. Which I could care less about on who uplifted the humans. The history on this planet was unique due to the supposedily extincted race called the Garthling. I would have to say that David Brin did a better job in this book.	2003-03-22

Navajo detectives Lephorn and Lee, one who is old and traditional and another who is young and modern tries to solve a case with a missing archaelogist. The whole indian culture, landscapes, tradition and history were perfect elements in this book. I have never read a fictional book that was deep in a culture that is vastly slowly fading away. Hillerman not only written a cultural quick fast paced story, he added a couple of twist which had thrown me off. I feel if this book had a great effect on me, which by the way, engulf me into a culture I rarely see anymore, I would truely read another Hillerman.	2003-03-22

Not only does his world had change but his psychologist takes advantage of his abilty and empowers himself for his own personal gain.

As a son of a preacher if I'd read this book ten years ago I would of burned it. When I first started reading this book I wasn't sure what the heck was going on. I feel that this is a mind opening book. It had a great message. Faith should be based on spirtually and not on religious aspects of trying to be a perfect christian. Any way, this story starts out when a secret organization try to uncover the truth of the religious faith of christianity & catholicism. Realizing the Benefactors aren't what they seem to be, the characters notice loopholes in religion. A group of characters go on a forbidden quest to find thier salvation from the Benefactors. Little did they know that thier salvation had also became a threat. I don't like to give too much away, all I have to say this is a sensational book.	2003-02-01

It was so bad I wanted the villian to get caught already. I just couldn't wait the finish the book, I honestly didn't want to put it down. It was a nice change of pace to see a network of women trying to solve a case. Instead of your testostorone filled action packed suspense book this was fully charged with estrogen.

I know others out there may feel to disagree with me but having reading this book after the events of Spetember 11, it was totally shocking realizing that this book was written in 1986. There were terrorist activies back then & still America never saw the warning signs. I think this book try to display of what can happen and strongly enough, it did, in a totally different aspect. If I read this book before the events of September 11, I would of thought nothing like this can happen and this can be made into an entertaining made for TV or Hollywood movie. Now the events in this book seem terrifying because alot of lives were lost because of terrorist acts cause by a militia group called the Green Band. The main character Arch Carroll, I felt was well portrayed & totally fit the book. Instead of your mister nice guy do gooder, you had your rough around the edges detective. I feel this book is strongly entertaining!! The end caught me by surprise because it was totally unexpected. For those who were affected due to the events of September 11, I wouldn't recommened this book.	2003-02-01

It reminds me of the 3 major religons of our world which are christianity, judism & muslim. I know this book is part of the Childe Cycle series but who cares. I loved Bleys Arhens who questioned the views of religon. Even though he seems powerful & becomes a genius at what he does, it didn't seem boring that he won all the time. I was rooting his him all the way. When I got to the end I was shock to find that Bleys was supposed to be a adversarial foe to Hal Mayne. So who the heck is Hal Mayne?

I thought it was crazy!! Why the heck would Drizzt go back to that horrid place. Well, anyways being a true R. A Salvatore fan myself. I wandered why Mr Salvatore would put Drizzt into certain situations. I love the great character development of Drizzt in each book. This book is a great addition to the adventures of Drizzt. If you love Drizzt you will love this book.	2003-02-01

I felt that this book was slightly rushed. The end of the first book \\"The First to Die\\" left a huge cliff hanger and then when I read this book \\"2nd Chance\\", not much was mentioned about it. I felt I was left hanging!! Like in some of his others book the killer is mentioned once, even though, I didn't guess who it was.... I'm starting to realize the more books I read by him are getting predictable. I will always be a James Patterson fan but now I know I have to read his books a few months apart so I don't have to guess quickly who the villian is. I wasn't on the edge of seat reading this book but again it was greatly entertaining.	2003-02-01

Okay James Paterson fooled me on this, one not once, not twice but three times. Again the ending is shocking as usuaul and left with a cliff hanger!! Alex Cross on the trail of the Mastermind and the Mastermind seems so lucid that there were no clues to track him down. Reading the Mastermind in third person was an exciting element to the book because it made it hard to guess who the heck he was!! In the Alex Cross Series this is my second favorite book!! Surperb suspense!!	2003-02-01

I have never read the first book but I feel I didn't need too. After finishing the book, I do see that this can become a Hollywood made movie. I'm not sure what Robert Morgan background is but there are some great military, political, scientific thoeries and senerios, in my opinion, are phenomenially well executed. After reading the 2nd chapter I was hooked. It showcased a dramatic scene about what a father would have to do in order for his family to survive. That scene was very intense. Later in the book, events that lead to a face-off between a female mayor and and angry mob had me on the edge of my seat. So much in this book keep my interest afloat, there were no boring elements at all!! This book from begining to end  was excellent reading. In the future, I will definitely read more books by this author.	2003-02-01

Dale Carnegie is one of the authors that make you feel that he is actually talking to you when you read his books. I kept this book on my night stand for about two years because trying to win friends and influence is a learning process. I kept it as a instant reminder just in case if I forgot certain things that were in the book. This book was recommeneded because I was a trying to get a job as a salesman. Even though, I didn't get the job I felt the book was a helpful tool for everyday life. To me this is one of the self-help books that had changed my life.	2003-02-01

To be honest, if I get hooked on a good character like Alex Cross I'm a fan for life. I feel that readers out there that are looking for great researched literature shouldn't read this book. I feel the Alex Cross series are greatly entertaining. All of his book are about &quot;edge of your seat&quot; suspense!! I really love this book. It's a story about a guy who has diplomatic immunity &amp; takes the game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons to the next level. At times I feel how can Alex Cross get this guy if this guy can't be touch by our American laws. I almost got deep into trying to critize on certain aspects of the book, but in the end I realized there is no need for it. If you need a quick suspense fix to past the time, then I recommend this book!	2003-02-01

When I first read it, my menatlity was this book would never work for me. Well, back then I was in a depressive state of mind. Years later someone gave this book as a gift. I thought it was a joke!!  I reread this book again one night it all made sense to me. I only recommended this book to those who are willing to look for a change in thier life. I wouldn't recommended these book to those who are set in thier ways. I feel life is an on going changing process, which by the way, this is one of the books that had help me realize that!	2003-01-26

Drizzt can be imitated and duplicated but there can only be one Drizzt. Drizzt is a very original character, in each book he discovers more of himself. I must admit if you're a new reader to this book you might feel you may want to read the previous books. I feel that there has never been a story about a drow as complex as he is. Drizzt learns honor through friendship, he know his friends are very important to him. He's brave for facing hatred every where he goes because of his race. I love the way that R A Salvatore tied up loose ends and he has left more room for cliff hangers. Which, by the way, are tied up in future books. Even though, readers might feel this character is too powerful, this powerful drow, over time he learns to use his brains over brawn. If you read the previous books, be in for a surprise. I was shocked to find out who was his equally powerful foe on the loose in this edition.	2003-01-26

You don't have to read the prequel \\"The Dark Elf trilogy\\" to love \\"The Icewind Dale Trilogy\\". R A Salvatore is indeed a genius at what he does. He continues to writes about Drizzt and his buddies because thats what the people demand. We want more Drizzt. In this volume you learn his encounters with the surface and how he learns to deals and cope of what others view of him because of his race. He has alot to prove because the world knows the drow has never been anything but evil. In this case, he's not evil like his race. He learns that it better to have friends than hiding and wandering in the dark being hunted by your own people. If you love Drizzt and his adventures you will definitely love this book!!	2003-01-26

I feel David Brin has brillant ideas but its never well put!! This book actually isn't half bad. I personally was rooting for the Galactics, the fearsome warrior alien race against the humans and thier allies. They seem more ineresting to me than the rest of the story. It was also interesting that the humans found a &quot;Herbie&quot; an ancient alien being that hold possible clues to thier past maybe who &quot;Uplifted&quot; them. Does it really matter who uplifted the humans. This book had way too many characters to follow and some shouldn't have been in the story. There isn't as many loop holes in this book as in Sundiver. I was hoping this book would fill in the gaps that was in Sundiver. I feel this book would of been a masterpiece if it was well thought out and focused into some kind of a direction.	2003-01-26

I feel when you read his books there is no guess work, just let the story flow. When you get to the end, you like \\"Wow!!\\" I just couldn't believe it. All his books are very entertaining. This first book of the Alex Cross series introduce you a detective name Alex Cross who is not just a detective but an African American detective. I feel he is a hero for all people. The way James Patterson decribes Alex and his family gives you a different viewpoint than your average run of the mill detective story. This book is an excellent read, as always, read the book first before watching the movie.	2003-01-22

The reason why I gave this book a two is because it had alot of well interesting ideas. This book lack focus and direction. I wasn't sure were the heck it was taking me. David Brin brought up so many things I eventually got lost. He also left loop holes and got me thinking about things he never bought up or mentioned again. Most of the time I was left with a big fat &quot;Huh??&quot; throught out finishing this book. If you happen to read part two of this series, you will also be loss because it doesn't tie up any loose ends with part one. Well, anyway that is a different story. I wouldn't recommened to book to anyone unless they want to put together the pieces of the story together in thier own way.	2003-01-21

Every book James Patterson writes is a page turner. I was blown away! I could never guess who the killer is in any of his books. The end left me dumbfounded!! To my suprise, I just couldn't believe it. Sorry, I don't want to give the ending away. I'm normally not a fan of the murder mystery genre, but James Paterson is good writer when it come to suspense. The best series I recommended his Alex Cross series. I feel this book is one of his best!	2003-01-21

What would humans of earth do if they happen to find other humans on another planet. This book displays a scenario of what might actually happen. Robert B Boardman is a good writer. He pulled off a good story of economics, politics and especially greed, in which, I feel is happening in our society today. I think he hit the nail right on the head with what our current government is acutually doing. I would of gave this book a five but it lack a little bit of &quot;Umpff&quot;, other than that this book is entertaining	2003-01-21

I gave this book a rating five stars because of how it flow. It is truely original and unique! I expected vampire traditions & cliches like in most books, to my surprise, there were little & it was truely a good read. Sonja battles herself as well as vampires! The Other is an alter ego she battles mentally to remain humanly sane. Her life begins in a whole new journey after her old life dies. Once she was a celebrity daughter of a multi-millionaire Denise Thorne, one horrific night changed her life and started a whole new journey of self discovery! She was not a true vampire she was something else. Wow, I was in disbelief she was something that I would have never thought of. This book was truely a page turner wanting to know what would happen next. I was please to find this book wasn't a typical vampire book cliche. There were some personal things I dislike, like after the vampires die they turn to goo instead of dust, like in Buffy, but that my preference! I'm glad I bought the collection instead of the individual books, because I was truely hungery for more once a book was done. I just keep reading. This book was recommend to me and I would like to recommend this book collection to others. If your a diehard Buffy fan read this book with an open mind or you'll dislike it!!	2001-09-22

My girlfriend begged me to read this book and at first I was reluctant to read it. I read the first chapter and I couldn't believe this was a true story about someone's life. I read this book in one day and I can't believe how glued I was to this book! I normally like fantasy, sci-fi, philosophy or historical fiction. I was truely blown away about Frank Mccourt life and how he survived the depression especially in Ireland. This book was depressing and made me want to cry, I was hoping for a happy ending. Even though the ending wasn't what I expected it. It makes me want to read the next book. Great writing Mr Mccourt!!	2001-09-09

The reason why I give it an excellent rating because it was well researched and put together well. True secrets from the past can now be re-lived and used in modern times. The useful tactics in this book can can used today. The true philosophical wisdom by such great philosophcal greats like Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Musashi and Baltasar Gracian are in this book! The whole format of the Laws 1-48 was great. Some of the laws can be applied to your daily life and some can be ignored if they don't pretain to you.

Even tough, the book is too detailed about every moment of certain actions that I didn't care about, it still a good book. I had to put this book down several times because it got too slow. The first seven chapters were quite  interesting, then it started too slow down. So, I just kept turning pages  and when I finally got to the end I was satisfied. This is the first book I  read about this author. I got interested about his references to Mithgar  and other characters in his other books. I really like the philosophical  and theological ideals of this book. I think Dennis McKiernan is a good  story teller. I would recommend this book to those who has the time to read  a good story.	2000-07-14

I saw the cover and I had to  have this book. So when I found out James Silke was the writer, I was a bit  skeptical because I never heard of this guy. But much to my surprise, I was  exilerated by the captiving story!  I'm surprised that James Silke does not  have any other books out there besides this series! I've always feel that  this character should be recogonized &amp; exploited but I don't think it  will ever happen! If anyone ever get a copy of a book of the this series,  please never let it go! It one of those series that will be legenadary in  your life and be willing to talk about!	2000-07-14

At first, I was reluctant to read a book by another author writing about the Underdark. I had to read this book with a new pair of eyes becuase I tend to compare the authors. Even though, I think R. A Salvatore is the  master of writing the drow and Menzoberranzan, Mrs. Cunningham brought a  whole new prespective of the Underdark. This book is a bit sutle in the  action department, but the story easily flow. By the time I was done  reading I couldn't believe it was over. I wanted more and I could't wait to  read the next installment, Tangled Webs. I love how Elaine Cunningham  writes the new aspects of the crumbling drow society. I really love this  book and I'm glad I didn't compare Liriel (the main character) to Drizzt  the famous drow of Menzoberranzan. At first, I thought Liriel would be a  female version of the powerful and loveable drow that we all had grown to  love, but I had to remember this is her story. I was enchanted by Mrs  Cunningham work and I'm looking forward to read more. I couldn't believe I  ignored her previous works before this book.	2000-07-14

I read all 3 volumes years ago. Now its all in one book. Those of you that haven't read this book is in for a surprise. I fell in love with all the characters and how Mr Salvatore tells his  stories. This book is the first beginings of the famous dark elf and his  crew. I just love how every character grows in their own way as each book  come along. The first book of this trilogy had me hooked and I read most of  the books he wrote. I feel that the writer puts real emotion within each  character that I grown to love and hate. I think the best part of the whole  Drizzt series are Drizzt's journals for each chapter. I sensed that the  writer is passionate and emotional with each character he writes. I say  this book will always be a keeper!	2000-07-12

I re-read it again &amp; deceided to buy the book, but it saddens me to say this book is now out of print. From start to finish, its a non-stop interesting story. It  about boy from a tribe following their common ritual quest to manhood.  There are unexpected comrades &amp; enemies that help come to his aid &amp;  jepordizes his quest. Finally, in the end he is unexpectedly greatly  rewarded. Back then, I remembered that I couldn't wait for the next  installment! I swear I thought this book was book one to a trilogy.

It one of  those books that I can read over again. Those who gave this book a bad  review I think don't have a good imagination.

I do love the philosophical &amp; theological ideals of the book, but too much details can kill good storytelling. I  personally think the book needs some trimming to really pack a punch! I was  drawn within the first seven chapters but when Aravan &amp; crew showed it  up it slowed down too much. There was too much rambling about pollution,  good vs evil, &amp; the ethics of humans while drifting out to sea while  searching for Farrix. I kinda found as useless. I had to put the book down  several times becuz it got boring. But when I finally finish the book, I  asked myself. &quot;Self, is this a good book&quot; Hell yeah it's a good  book!  But I do not recommend this book to people who don't read often.	2000-07-11

At first, I was reluctant to read a book by another author of the Underdark. We all know that Mr. Salvatore is the master! The book easily flowed and by the time I was done. I couldn't believe the book was over. I  can't wait for the next book! I loved the fact, that there were other Gods  &amp; Goddess besides the infamous spider queen. I was also fasinated with  the community of drow outside of Menoberranzan dancing in the moonlight  praising another Goddess.(I would like to see a cat fight between her and  Lloth) I found Fyodor an interesting character even though little is known  about him. All in all, this book is an interesting read. The transition  from the underdark to the surface, I sensed that E.C. felt more at ease  when the story took place on the surface. To be honest, if your a diehard  Salvatore fan, I doubt you will like this book. I had to read this book  with a new pair of eyes. Just remember that this is Liriel's story &amp;  not a female copycat of the well known powerful, but lovable hero from  Menoberranzan.	2000-07-11
