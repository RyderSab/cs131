I always wondered why Lee didn't try to outflank the Union army at Gettysburg and attack it from the rear.  The author makes a plausible case that Lee tried exactly this on the 3rd day by sending Stuart's cavalry circling around to the north.  Until recently, I was not consciously aware of the cavalry battle that Stuart fought that day, as it was usually skimmed over or even unmentioned in the more general histories that I tended to read.  Even if one doesn't accept all the author's reasoning, Stuart did in fact fight this battle, and I find it hard to believe that he would not then have gone on to attack the Union rear had he won the battle. <br /> <br />The only negative I found about the book is all the discussiopn of Napoleon, Alexander, etc in what I regard as digressions.  Some of these occur right in the middle of the narrative and severely interrupt its flow.  Eventually I quit reading them.  I would suggest reprinting the book and totally omitting this material.	2005-09-29

(But not since 1871;  the National Association is not included.)  Top players' season stats are usually given for each team, and say, Hoss Radbourne's 1884 season is discussed in detail, but to me the primary focus seemed on the owners and their machinations.  And purposely or not, the owners generally come off as a bunch of money grubbers who seldom had the good of the game at heart.  Or maybe that type of owner is just more interesting to write about.  One noticeable thing is that because of the many franchise shifts in the 19th century, there are roughly as many 19th century clubs to write about as 20th century.  Of course, since many of the 19th century clubs were short-lived, they take up less space on average.  Each team's record, where it placed in the league standings, and its managers are given for each year in a table at the end of that team's entry.  However, there are no tables of league standings showing all teams at once;  nor are there any tables of player performances included anywhere.  Some interesting note about players and others are in brief sidebars and footbars.   <br /> <br />I debated about rating the book four stars, since it spends so much time on the business end of baseball, but decided to go with five stars, as where else will you find narrative histories of all the major league baseball clubs in one inexpensive book?	2005-09-13

However, in just a few hours perusing the book, I have found a multitude of errors and anomalies which suggest to me a lack of care in putting the book together, something I would not expect from a book bearing the Oxford imprint.  Some of these are: <br /> <br />--on p94 the battle of Antietam is said to have occurred in 1863.  Sure, misprints happens, but shouldn't one of this import be caught? <br /> <br />--similarly, the first sentence on p182 refers to July 1, in a context that appears to indicate that this date refers to the upcoming action, which happens to be the second day of Gettysburg, July 2! <br /> <br />--on p206, the article correctly speaks of an action between the ships Alabama and Kearsarge off Cherbourg, France, whereas the accompanying map shows Atlanta and Kearsarge at that location. <br /> <br />--In a worse example of map error, the overview map of the Vicksburg campaign on p165 shows the Yazoo and the Big Black as essentially the same river:  rather than separately flowing into the Mississippi north of Vicksburg, the Yazoo is shown joining up with the Big Black and flowing with it into the Mississippi well south of Vicksburg. <br /> <br />--near the bottom of p302, in an example of poor editing, the phrase \\"sometimes wading for hours at a time\\" occurs redundently in two close together sentences.    <br /> <br />--in a worse example of poor editing, Grant's actions at the end of 1862 (1st Vicksburg) are placed out of chronological order prior to his actions at the beginning of 1862 (Fort Donelson and Shiloh), so that the 1862 campaign in the west is hard to follow. <br /> <br />--near the bottom of p286, the text refers (in words) to \\"eighteen thousand percent\\" Confederate inflation, whereas the figure shown at the bottom of p202 says \\"1800 percent\\".  I certainly hope that the writers of this book don't think these two numbers are the same. <br /> <br />--in what may just be a Britishism, the glossary states that soldiers found it difficult \\"bighting\\" into hardtack. <br /> <br />Some of these errors I noticed by merely glancing at a page;  others I discovered with a closer reading.  However, given that I have at most perused a few dozen pages of the book, this seems to me to be an inordinate mumber of errors, indicative of sloppy editing and perhaps a rush job to meet a deadline.  You may not mind these errors, but I do, and I give you fair warning.	2005-08-08

Wells (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Recently read, and very enjoyable	I recently read all the stories in this book over a period of a week.  They are arranged in a nice, thematic way, so that similar stories are grouped together.  I was amazed at the breadth of the subject matter of the stories, having previously restricted myself to Wells' speculative short stories such as \\"The Land Ironclads\\".  But \\"The Valley of Spiders\\" is a spooky story of what apparently are cowboys on a chase, and the first story in the book, \\"A Slip Under the Microscope\\", is a realistic story of college students, that shows how little has changed in over 100 years.  In fact, if one thing struck me about all the stories it is how modern they all are;  there were no anachronisms that spoiled any story, though of course you have to put yourself back before airplanes and tanks were invented in \\"The Argonauts of the Air\\" and \\"The Land Ironclads\\".  Rather than reviewing all the stories individually, I will just say that anyone who enjoys imaginative short stories will surely find much to like here.	2005-07-25

When I tried reading this book as a child many, many years ago, some of the \\"big\\" words and allusions made it hard going, and I never completed it then.  Finally, about fifteen years ago I did read it through, but still was missing something.  Then, a few weeks ago, I got this edition, after having enjoyed the Penguin edition of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" with its annotations and map.  Well, the annotations in this edition (about four pages worth as endnotes) of \\"The Time Machine\\" cleared away whatever fuzz remained, and I was completely overcome by the greatness of the book, great from whatever way I looked at it:  plot, speculation, characters, \\"sense of wonder\\", even throw away humor were all topnotch.  I couldn't believe what I'd been missing.  A few days later, I read another editon of the book that didn't have notes, and had no trouble following that version.  I plan to reread the book again shortly.  So if you've had difficulty reading \\"The Time Machine\\" for some of the reasons mentioned above, get this version pronto and find out what a true classic is.	2005-07-25

But the only one that stuck in my memory as more than a pleasant way to pass the time was this book (published by Ace as \\"The Lost Continent\\").  When I found this edition of the book available under the original title with critical commentary, I immediately bought it, even though I still have the Ace version.  I was not disappointed.  In addition to the story itself being as exciting and though-provoking as I remembered, the commentaries (a foreward and two afterwords) were all excellent.  I won't bother to repeat other reviews as to plot, etc, but just say that if you enjoy alternate history, you won't go wrong with this book.   <br />	2005-07-13

It is the kind of reading one can dip into at just about any point, and I have read those sections that I was particularly interested in:  the near eastern ancient world up to the Alexander, and the empire of Attila.  I wish Amazon had the table of contents posted, as that reflects the structure of the books;  essentially, that the author uses important battles as his climaxes, with material on strategy, tactics, logistics, etc leading up to the battle descriptions, which are then followed by a discussion of the commanders involved in the battle.   <br /> <br />Importantly, the books cover \\"empires\\" and not \\"kingdoms\\", except as brief background.  So Assyria is not covered directly until it becomes an \\"empire\\" in the late 8th century BCE, and Byzantium until its fall seems not to be covered directly at all.  Roman history essentially begins with Hannibal's invasion, at which point the author apparently deems Rome has become an empire.  Though many battles of the Roman Civil Wars of Caesar and Augustus are covered, the Roman Empire itself is covered rather briefly, with Teutoburger Wald and Adrianople being the only battles discussed in detail for the first four centuries CE.  (The author uses the BCE, CE dating notation.)  Then Chalons is covered in the section on the Huns.   <br /> <br />The discussion of Chalons raises some questions I have about the books.  The author gives a detailed blow-by-blow account of the battle, whereas several other scholarly books on the subject state that not enough is known about the battle to permit a reconstruction.  Since the author gives nary a footnote stating his rationales anywhere in the three volumes, and does not discuss his reasoning in the text itself, it is impossible to tell whether the author's account of Chalons is based on new research, the author's best guess, or just the author's imagination.   <br /> <br />Be that as it may, the text of the book reads very easily;  I found myself able to bite off huge chunks of it in rather brief sittings.  There are also adequate maps and illustrations, but no index.  I did note during the discussion of Gaugamela that the author apparently became confused between the left and right wing of the Persian army, and in the discussion of early Egypt he implied that Palestine is to the west of Egypt.  So the books must be read with a bit of care, and in fact do not provide a complete military history from 4000 BCE to 1453 CE, but rather detailed snippets of particular times, which, of course, is just what the author intended.	2005-07-11

Though I can't truly claim to be an expert on the subject now, I almost feel as though I am one, because this book is so well written.  The narrative is very easy to follow and the plentiful maps and photographs are close to superb.  Plus, the discussion of the centuries preceeding the actual war, though brief, put the war in context quite nicely.  There really isn't anything more to say except that if you want a short introduction to the Boer War, then buy and read this book!	2005-06-13

I didn't read this book from cover to cover, but mainly dipped into the latter part, from which I learned about events such as the Mongol invasion of Java of which I was unaware, as well as learning more about the Mongol invasion of Japan than I had known before.  I am not particularly a student of Genghis Khan and the Mongal conquests, but do feel reasonably well informed on events up to 1260.  Thus the material concerning events after 1260 was what I was interested in, and I feel the book did a fine, informative job on that.  So for me the book was excellent, and I give it 5 stars on that basis.	2005-06-13

There are no sections on daily life or the lives of women, for instance.  There is some discussion of government, but that fits under politics.  The military history is at the operational or strategic level, not at the tactical level.  Battles are very briefly described, mainly just stating who the victor was.   However, the book is not just a bare recital of \\"one thing after another\\";  the author also tries to get inside the head of the leading personalities to divine their intentions.  Whatever the author discusses, it is so engagingly written that the story just carries the reader along.  Several times I tried dipping into the book to just read a page or two but invariably found myself swept along until at least the end of the chapter.  Highly recommended for those who like this approach to history.	2005-03-14

The author divides the period from prehistory to about 500BC into four periods:  prehistory itself; the age of city-states, characterised by siege warfare; the age of ruling aristocracies, characterised by chariot warfare; and the age of nationalistic empires, characterised by infantry warfare and mass (for the time) armies.  The author gives easy to follow explanations for these changing modes of warfare.  Most of the focus is on Mesoptoamia, with Egypt also covered fairly well.  There is brief discussion of India, but China is mentioned only in passing.   Organization is chronological, not thematic.  The author has his own theories (e.g. chariots were used in combat as arrow platforms, not merely to carry elite warriors to the battlefield) but he gives adequate time to alternate theories.  There is a biographical appendix and a list for further reading.  I found the book well worth the money.	2005-02-22

On the other hand, there is not a single map in the book.  This may be little or no problem for a WWII afficianado, who likely has the requisite maps in his or her head, but could cause major annoyances for others, who will need a good atlas at the ready.  Though primarily a military history as claimed, this is not the type of military history that focuses on the individual soldier.  In fact, few military formations below the level of army group (= Russian front) are named or their movements discussed.  This is definitely broad sweep military history.  But some relatively obscure actions are given more space than one might expect:  for example the Madagascar campaign is given half a page.  On the other hand, the much longer South Pacific campaigns are relegated to a couple of pages.  Author's choice, I suppose.  There is some discussion of the home fronts, particularly the submarine war against England, and the bombing campaign against Germany.  Munich and the lead-up to the war are covered in fair detail.  All in all, an interesting read, though not the best book for the novice.	2004-11-08

I became so enthralled, I read it in one sitting.  The language flows so nicely, that this only took me a little over an hour.  I already plan to reread it as soon as I get the time.  If you read it, I suggest doing what I did--read only the first seven pages of the Introduction, then skip to page 65 and read the two page note that precedes the poem itself, and then dive right on into the poem.  After reading that, you can go back and read the rest of the Introduction, which just takes you through the poem with some commentary, but by reading it after reading the poem your reading of the poem itself won't be spoiled.	2004-11-02

Many conversations are given as direct quotes, but without attribution.  When the author does appeal to authority to support his conclusions, that authority is often one of his own books!  But this is not intended to be a scholarly work, just an enjoyable, easy read, which it is.  One lack I noticed is that there is not a single map included in the book.  But then again, the book is not really about what is going on on the ground (though major campaigns are described), but what is going on in Stalin's mind.  Offsetting the lack of maps is the inclusion of many sidebars, some a couple of pages long, that I often found more interesting and informative than the text itself.  Good for Hoyt fans.	2004-10-13
US	50763950	RL4OBCM15FYRP	0786415207	959564391	Encyclopedia of the Byzantine Empire	Books	2	19	20	N	Y	Not recommended	I was prepared to like this book, as it has a nice look and feel--physically well-constructed with easy to read print arranged in two columns.  However, as soon as I started reading, I encountered problems.  The maps referred to in the book description are in fact only two--one of the Empire around 1025 and other around 1350.  Both maps are very sketchy--only two cities are named on each, Constantinople and Venice.  Then we consider the heart of the book, the entries.  The Czech Republic is said to be part of the Balkan Peninsula under that entry.  Under the entry for the themes,  no mention is made of when the themes were initially founded or by whom;  Heraclius is said to have founded them under his entry, but there is no cross reference to him under the themes entry.    The entry for Belisarius implies he was in Italy continuously until 548 after first going.  In his entry, Justinian is stated to have attacked the Visigoths in Spain in the 540s rather than the correct 550s.  Most of the entry for Tripoli concerns the city of that name in Lebanon, but it is also stated that this city \\"was an important part of the trade route through the Sahara\\", a statement that seems more appropriate for the city of Tripoli in Libya.  There is a somewhat detailed entry on Bohemia;  I'm not sure why this is so in a book on Byzantium.  On the plus side, there are many charts and tables and an extensive bibliography, plus some black-and-white photographs.  But in my opinion the book contains too many misleading statements to be of much use either to a specialist or a casual reader.  I still give the book two stars as it does in fact have a nice look and feel.	2004-08-24

It does not stray from a its direct path to the latest thinking about string theory. Thus, though quantum theory is often at the center of the discussion, the double slit experiment is not mentioned, since the author apparently feels it is not necessary for his main point that quantum theory is \\"weird\\". I agree with the author's approach on this point. There is also essentially no math in the book. The only formula is Einstein's famous E = M times c-squared, and there is a numerical example to illustrate the inverse square concept, and that's it for math. I've done a lot of reading about quantum theory over the last few years and am a math professor by trade, but still found this one of the best books I have read. I especially enjoyed how the author handled the history. It is true the last chapter on the meaning of it all could have been omitted, but I feel the book is stronger for including this philosopical material. Highly recommended.	2004-07-30

Therefore I highly recommend the book.  I've recently read a more detailed book on the Wars of Religion, but found the material here a very clear outline, particularly in conjunction with the several page chronology in the back of the book which expands on the text material, not only for the Wars of Religion, but for the entire period covered in the text.  The brief section of the French experience overseas was especially well handled--I felt I learned the key points for understanding this time period in just a few pages.  And as implied above, I also enjoyed reading and learned a lot from the many sections on economics, politics, and social trends.  As well, most of the locales mentioned in the text are actually on maps included in the book, which can sometimes not be the case with history books.  One of the best book I've read on Early Modern Europe.	2004-07-30

After reading this book, I feel I now have a clear outline of the military aspects and strategies of the war.  (Though there is some discussion of the homefront, that doesn't dominate.)  I was wanting to read a dispassionate look at the war in its military aspects, and this book delivered, in my opinion.  If you're looking for a brief introduction to the war, I highly recommend this book.  The text is easy to follow, and there are many useful maps and photographs.	2004-06-21

The author makes use of archival information released since the fall of the Soviet Union, so is more up to date than many books on the Russian front.  Many casualty figures gleaned from this new information are presented--though the author dwells on them perhaps a little too much for my taste.  The maps in the book are essentially adequate, but I would have liked a specific map of the front in June 44, since frequent mention is made in the text of the &quot;balcony&quot; salient held by Army Group Center at the time--without a specific map it is hard to visualize what is meant by the &quot;balcony&quot;, though of course those familiar with the war will know.  The Stalingrad campaign is actually the portion of the war covered at most length, even moreso than the initial invasion.  There are many photos, some in color.  One color photo shows some German soldiers on the open steppe with a blue sky in the background--looking at it, I almost felt I was there myself in 1941 plunging into the unknown depths of Russia.  My bottom line is, though probably not the best short introductory book possible on the subject, this book is certainly worth the price tag.	2004-04-29

My sense from reading these is that Bronko Nagurski was not treated in his own time as the legendary player he has since become.  For example, I don't recall in my reading of the newspapers any accounts of Nagurski carrying the ball on 19 of 21 plays (or some such) as is reported in this book, though of course the newspapers didn't report every game detail.  Nagurski's season and career stats also don't necessarily support that he was the dominant runner usually depicted.  His career stats indicate he carried the ball on average less than ten times per game, and in 1931, for example, this book itself states that teammate Red Grange outrushed him 599 yards to 401 (not counting one game with incomplete stats).  To me these facts call into question the \\"Bronko as Superman\\" thesis.<br />A lack for me in the book is, though the book does include some statistics, it does not summarize Nagurski's career statistics anywhere.  Personally, as a reasearcher, I would have liked to have seen Bronko's career summarized game-by-game in an easy to retrieve format;  in effect, a more scholarly book.   <br />On the other hand, this book includes much personal interest information not usually found in newspaper stories, but I would have preferred that the author not use so much \\"salty language\\" in quoting players to report this info.  Perhaps this is realistic reportage, but I feel it makes the book unsuitable for young people, particularly if we are trying to teach the  sportsmanship much lacking today.  I am also dubious that the many direct quotes in the book were all actually spoken.  <br />I also didn't like the author's habit of jumping around in chronology, even within the same season, as it made the sequence of events often hard to follow.  And though the author clearly has done more research than is usual for books of this type, I still picked up on the ocassional questionable statement.  For example, the author states that Red Grange ran 94 yards on the second play of the 1924 Illinois-Michigan game whereas every other source I've read says Red returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown.  (Interestingly, the book spends quite a lot of space on Red Grange.  Since I am interested in Red's career, I often found this the most useful part of the book!)  <br />In sum, if you like personal interest stories from the early days of pro football, you will undoubtedly like this book;  if you are primarily interested in facts and statistics, as I am, you my be somewhat disappointed, as I was.	2003-11-10

I was going to write a long review, but when I read the editorial reviews above, I found they described the contents of the book almost exactly as I had intended to do, so I will not repeat those descriptions here.  I will note that the book does require a working knowledge of World War I;  it is not for the beginner.  And it is not, nor intended to be, a complete history of the war.  But, for example, the two chapters on the Somme give the best short overview of the entire battle I have read in 35 years of studying WWI.  In every essay in the book I gained some new insights.  I will also point out that the book does not have to be read in order;  I jumped back and forth often in my reading.  I'd give this book six stars if I could.	2003-08-07

And I now have an understanding of the Paraguyan War and the War of the Pacific, wars that I had only seen outline accounts of before that were too brief to really get a sense of their flow.  In this book there are enough maps and geographical descriptions to go along with the narrative that I got a feeling of almost &quot;being there&quot;.  <br />The author follows the same format for each chapter.  He begins with a sentence or two on what sparked the war, followed by a paragraph or so on necessary background.  Then follows the bulk of the chapter and heart of the book--the narrative description of the war.   Each chapter concludes with a short section of the author's observations on what the war meant in a broader context.<br />Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Latin America or warfare in general.	2003-07-25

This is a tightly organized book covering primarily the Eastern Roman Empire during the years indicated in the title of the book and using the standard format for this series.  I'm quite familiar with this period, and found nothing essential left out--an amazing amount of material is covered in a minimum number of pages in a very readable manner.  As indicated, the main focus of the book is the eastern empire, but the western empire is covered as relevant though the German successor kingdoms are not covered in detail.  Highly recommended if you have any interest in this period at all.	2003-05-29

It is just the right length to give an easy to follow strategic overview, that is complete in essentials for that level.  And for those readers desiring a look at the &quot;little people&quot; involved, there are two sections, one about a soldier's experiences, and another about a Korean family's experiences.  There are more than an adequate number of maps, making it easy to follow the ebb and flow of battle.  The writing flows along in a nice, easy to read manner.  The author is a student of wars of attrition, and his interest and expertise show on every page.	2003-02-18

I found it so readable that I finished it in one sitting.  The book omits the kind of detail that bogs things down and causes the reader to lose sight of the &quot;forest for the trees&quot;, but does give the reader a real sense of the times and of the sequence of events and their relationships.

I should have known I was in trouble when, early in his introduction, he says his basic premise is that 90% of everything is garbage.  He then proceeds to demonstrate that view in his reviews.  And, despite his know-it-all attitude, I spotted several errors of fact in various reviews, for example, his referring to the Gene Barry character in War of the Worlds as Dr. &quot;Clayton&quot;, as though Clayton were the character's last name.   This may seem like a small item, but the author himself continually nitpicks the movies he is reviewing, so turn-about is fair play.  I would give the book one star, except for a few insights I found.  However, I decided the book was not worth keeping as a reference, and have already disposed of it at a used bookstore.	2003-01-10

All aspects are covered, though concetration is on military events viewed from a high strategic level.  Thus, only about a page is spent on the Battle of the Marne and surrounding events, but the reader is made aware of the basic movements and their importance.  And, in one paragraph, the author conveys a better feel for the ebb and flow on the eastern front in 1914 than usually happens in more detailed histories.  One is never going to lose sight of the forest for the trees in this book!  There are spare but useful maps, some photographs, and a table of casualty figures.  There are a few misprints, and some awkward syntax on occasion.  Also, from a style viewpoint, I felt the author overused the phrase &quot;as we have seen&quot;.  But those are minor quibbles about an overall excellent book.	2002-10-23

Care has been taken in writing the captions and section introductions, which does not always happen in picture books--this is a scholarly book as well as a fan book. The only negative about the book is that it is not the definitive book of photos of Elvis--there are (I presume for copyright reasons) none of the famous photos of Elvis on Milton Berle or Steve Allen. There are also no truly unflattering photos of the later Elvis, but I assume those buying the book would, like me, not want such photos anyway.  On the other hand, there are many pictures I hadn't seen before, and all the pictures, familiar or not, are well-presented.  A good buy.	2002-09-13

It assumes the reader is familiar with the campaigns and battles mentioned, and so is not for a Civil War novice.  The book begins with a counterfactual depiction of Early's raid, and the resulting consequences.  It then segues to the author's previously published arguments that the West was the decisive theatre, and that Grant should have stayed there or at least put Thomas in command.  ... The book then concludes with a short defense of Lee's grand strategic thinking.  I found the book so interesting, readable, and short, that I finished it in one four hour sitting.  At times the arguments seemed a little overwrought, and I'm sure those who feel the East was the decisive theatre will have their counter arguments, but none of this prevented my enjoying the book.	2002-05-20

While there is some material on this (apparently little is actually known), most of the book is about the scientists who discovered these objects and how they did it.  If you're looking for a book on how scientists work, this is quite good, but if like me you're looking for a book on the results of that work, you may be disappointed.  I feel the title is a misnomer (though probably attention getting), because Pluto and its moon are among the objects discussed!  Also, most of the objects orbit between Neptune and Pluto (at least when Pluto is at its average distance), so are really better described as trans-Neptunian than trans-Plutonian.  I don't mean to be so negative about the book;  it wasn't what I expected, based on the title, but it could be just what you're looking for.	2002-05-20

Without wasted words, every aspect of Confederate ironclads is covered:  design, construction, armor, armament, life on board, strategy, tactics, and actual combat actions.  Nor is analysis lacking.  The author contends that the casemate ironclad was the best design possible given the Confederate resources available, and after switching doctrine from one of expecting the ironclads to break the blockade to one of having them defend vital ports, they performed their function well.  As is usual with Osprey, the book contains many diagrams, photographs, and color artwork, including a cutaway drawing of CSS Virginia.  Information about the 22 ironclads actually comissioned is assembled in an appendix, but any put under construction are mentioned somewhere, including CSS Stonewall, a non-casemate ironclad built in France.  The only misprint I noticed was in the appendix where CSS Huntsville is spelt &quot;Husville&quot;.  The book is suitable for those just starting to learn about Confederate ironclads, and old hands who want a quick reference available.	2002-05-20

The author admits to liking biographies and books that present the &quot;big picture&quot;.  This is reflected in his selections, in which only one book on a campaign (Sears' on the Antietam campaign) is included.  A couple of fiction items make the list:  &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; and &quot;Killer Angels&quot;.  Wooster not only rates McPherson's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; #1, but says it &quot;ranks among the world's greatest books&quot;.  Each of the 50 books is given a three or four page review, but comparing the amount of information in them to the shorter reviews of the same books in Eicher, I felt Eicher did a better job in less space.  Wooster also consistently misspells Mary Chesnut's name as Chestnut.  However, Wooster is more up to date, including several books published since Eicher came out in 1997.  But all in all, I expect to get more use out of Eicher.	2002-05-20

I mainly bought it for the material on quantum theory , and here the author does a fine job by presenting many analogies, most that I hadn't seen before, which were quite helpful.  But perhaps due to what the author would classify as my Western, linear thinking, the plethora of material on non-Western and/or non-scientific approaches to &quot;Theories of the Universe&quot;, left me generally cold.  Though interesting at times, there was ultimately too much of this material for my taste.  Readers with a different world view from mine will no doubt react differently.  I will be keeping the book for its excellent material on quantum theory.	2001-12-21

In fact, many topics, such as Charlemagne and Norman Sicily, which are not strictly Byzantine, are coverd at some length.  The major focus of the Byzantine material itself is Iconoclasm.  So while the book is very readable, and without footnotes, it is probably not the best first book on Byzantium for the general reader, but better suited to those who already have some background and want to learn more about the topics covered.  Included are four maps, and a large section of black-and-white plates, most being photos of things religious.	2001-12-19

However, it is a much more lively read than this intent would indicate. The scope of the book is more limited than the title would imply, covering mainly the the Reformation, the Hapsburg-Valois wars, and the military changes of the period (why open battles were replaced by sieges). There is some coverage of the Islamic threat to Europe, but little mention of England or Russia, for example. The book has nice plates and maps, and sidebars with questions for the student (or reader) to ponder.	2001-11-28

It includes chronologies of virtually every European country, though I had the impression the reader is assumed be already somewhat familiar with the names and terminolgies involved.  Based on my interests, I particularly found beneficial the dozen or so pages describing the major wars of the period, including even the rather obscure Hungarian-Ottoman war of 1593-1606.  I have a feeling that a given reader's reaction to the book will greatly depend on what he or she is looking for.  For me, the book filled a niche.	2001-11-28

This short book gives a strategic, operational, and tactical  overview of the Byzantine army in action.  It is not a book about the Byzantine army as an institution;  even the themes are given a relatively brief look.  Byzantine society and religion are only peripherally mentioned.  The first campaign studied is Dara (530) ;  the last is Myriokephalon (1176).  There is an easy to follow description of the Yarmuk campaign against the Arabs.  Several battles against the Bulgars are also described with clarity.  About half the battles discussed are Byzantine defeats.  This book, focused as it is, goes a long way toward filling a gap in Byzantine studies.	2001-10-01

In summer 2001 I borrowed the original edition of the book from a university library and read it completely through.  I have mixed feelings about the book, though I did like it enough to purchase the recent reprint.  I was mainly interested in finding a narrative history of the period in question, and while the book has some narrative, its main focus is why Theophylact wrote as he did. His writing is compared and contrasted in detail to that of the writings of other source historians of the period. This comparing is interspersed throughout even the putatively narrative sections of the book.  From my viewpoint, this made for choppy reading, though I am well aware that a professional historian of the period would find these discussions the most important part of the book. To somewhat offset the choppiness of the text, there are about four pages of chronological tables, which do nicely summarize events in the Balkans and Persia. (Since Theophylact did not write about the west, there is almost nothing in the book about events west of the Balkans.) A real plus is that there are some good maps; there was no place mentioned in the text that I could not find quickly on a conveniently placed map. (However, in the recent reprint of the book, some of the shadings on the maps reproduced faintly, if at all, though borders and place names are all still clear.)	2001-09-06

Basically, this book (which actually comes slipcased as two volumes) is a bibliographical dictionary, covering every known person in the aristocracy, Roman and otherwise, except those whose entire lives were spent in religious pursuits. Also, emperors lives are covered in detail only up to the point when that individual became emperor. Almost all entries contain cross references to other entries, in some case quite a few such references. All the sources used in obtaining the information about a given individual are explicitly mentioned within the body of the entry. Most entries utilize some Greek and Latin, and a few short entries (of apparently very minor individuals) are in those languages only, but the vast bulk of the book is in English, and enough of it so that if you want to study the period in detail, plan on years of reading! The entry on Belisarius is the longest in the book, and comes in at 42 pages. Narses is about half that long, but dozens of other generals rate four to twelve pages. And not only generals are covered--the entries on the Apion family from Egypt total many pages. The Franks are covered in detail (mostly via Gregory of Tours). The Lombards and Visigoths are covered in somewhat less detail (I think primarily because of limitations in the sources). Purposely, only those Persians, Arabs, and Moslems whose activities impinged significantly on the Empire are covered. Britain is omitted completely. Several individuals whose important activities began before 527 (Bessas, Liberius, and Germanus among others) are covered in detail in the previous volume of the Prosopography, and are only given a few lines here. Essentially, what the author of this book has done is collate an enormous amount of information about individuals into a readable and useful format. I have found the book to be wonderful for browsing, and also as a handy reference to check up on names encountered during the course of other reading.	2001-08-27

This book is John Haldon's approach to a short Byzantine history for the general reader, and he does a good job of it.  It is a scholarly book void of sensationalism, but without a lot of scholarly apparatus;  for example, there are only seven brief footnotes.  The book has a nice selection of maps delineating the the territorial vacilations of the empire over time, plus some additional maps showing things like trade routes.  The book is printed on slick paper and so is able to include a large section of color plates.  There are eight chapters in the book, two of which are narrative, while the remaining six are devoted to Byzantine institutions, culture, and society.  The narrative chapters divide at 741, and give a fairly complete overview of Byzantine history.  I did notice a few places in the book where better copy editing would have helped--at the bottom of p45 an emperor seems to be deposing himself, and there were a few sentences that appeared to be missing verbs, though their meaning was clear.  Among recent books, this book most closely compares to Treadgold's &quot;Concise History&quot;.  The major difference betwen the two is that Treadgold is 75% narrative and 25% society, whereas Haldon reverses these percentages.  I prefer narrative history, but found Haldon's book very readable and quite useful on its own terms.  I'm glad I have both books in my library.	2001-08-17

Once the reader deciphers these mistakes, though, he or she finds a generally well thought out and organized book, that covers both political and social aspects of Roman history from the founding of the city to the fall, followed by a brief section on Byzantium and the West in the middle ages.  The author translates Roman writings in sidebars using colloquial English or even slang.  I liked this informal approach, though others might not.  He has a penchant for puns, such as Commodus wanting to rename Rome after himself, i.e. &quot;Commodeville&quot;.  I also was brought up with a start when he said at points in Roman history women had more freedoms than at any time until the last century--by which I realized he meant the 20th!  The book contains several maps and photographs.  Without the typos, I would have rated the book five stars.	2001-08-03

It wasn't written, for my taste, in a particularly engaging style.  (For point of comparison, I love Treadgold's style).  Or perhaps it's just that is a time in the history of Byzantium when everyone appears to be pursuing their individual interests to the detriment of the state as a whole, and this simply made for a depressing read.  In any case, I found myself skipping through the book to find those portions that interested me.  On the other hand, since this is the only book I know of that covers this period in detail, I will keep the book in my collection.	2001-07-25

This was a very readable book, that I have just completed.  I read about eighty percent of it, only skipping or skimmimg a few sections.  Admittedly, this would not make a good introductory book, and probably not even a good second book, on the period, but if you are interested in the period and have a working knowledge of it, I am sure you will find much of interest.  The book begins with an evocative 150 pages or so of narrative historical overview, with the latest interpretations of chronology.  Some of this material is then covered in a more thematic way, and also in an area-by-area manner, later in the book.  There are also many sections on various social aspects.  One such that I gained much from was the one on education.  Interestingly, there was no separate section on women.  The bibliography is 100 pages long, so the reading matter itself is about 1000 pages.  The book was worth the money to me.	2001-07-23

The careers of important personages are also outlined, not just emperors.  I expect to learn a lot from the articles on special topics, some of which are indicated in the editorial review.  The maps are clear and not overloaded with detail, but I would have liked a map of the empire around 700 to be included, instead of skipping from 565 to 1025.  But that's a minor quibble.

It is not intended as a &quot;life&quot; of the Kaiser, but only as an analysis of his rule.  I was looking for this kind of focus, so was happy with the book.  The author's main thesis is that under the German constitution in effect at the time, the Kaiser had little actual power.  While able to influence events, he could not control them.  Only in the German shipbuilding plan did the Kaiser play a leading role.  The author feels that Wilhelm sincerely wanted to avoid war in 1914.  Actually, most of the book is not about the war years, giving the reader a more balanced overview of the reign.  It is suggested that Wilhelm was one of the first &quot;media&quot; personalities, partly because of his penchant of making off-the-cuff remarks that continually got him bad publicity.  The author discusses these various remarks based on the context in which they were made and the audience they were intended for, in a partially sucessful attempt to show they were not so outrageous as usually presented.  While the book is not a whitewash of the Kaiser, the author does try to show he was not the arch-fiend of Allied propaganda.  Since this is my personal view, I was in sympathy with the author's approach.	2001-07-02

Since I have a map of Europe circa 1914 in my head, I haven't minded the lack of maps.  In fact, the flow of my reading has likely been enhanced by my not flipping to a map every time a place name is mentioned, and the author does verbally described the topography where needed.   The sidebars and short blurbs are also well-written.  I have detected a couple of &quot;typos&quot;, but nothing serious.  An excellent introduction.  I rate 4-stars only because of the lack of any maps, which a pure novice would need.	2001-06-04
US	50763950	R28WKPNZ68QXB	0060196769	270759759	The Myth of the Great  War : A New Military History of World War 1	Books	2	14	24	N	N	A slanted history	The author has three basic themes in this book: the German army never did anything wrong (unless Ludendorff made a bad decision), the British army and generals never did anything right, and the US army won WWI for the Allies. Any evidence to the contrary is either dismissed as Allied propaganda or simply not mentioned. For instance, the German retrograde movement after the British attack of 8 August 1918 is not due to anything the British army did, but was merely due to the clever Germans making a well-timed voluntary withdrawal. The fact that Ludendorff called this day \\"the black day of the German army\\" is not mentioned, let alone discussed. On the other hand, the German voluntary withdrawal from the San Mihiel salient five weeks later in the face of a US attack is presented as a great victory for the Americans, and evidence of how they won WWI for the Allies. According to the author, the German movement to the Aisne in September 1914 was made voluntarily by them because they had realized the time had come to prepare for a long war so they pulled back to a better defensive line. The possibility that this movement represented a strategic defeat for the Germans is not considered. The author goes on at length arguing that the name \\"Battle of the Marne\\" is a misnomer (which it is to some extent), and further that the very name is just a case of Allied propaganda designed to divert attention from the fact that the Germans at the time were still making gains around Verdun (such as creating the San Mihiel salient). The author stresses casualty figures as evidence of German combat superiority, particularly death statistics, as he regards these as more reliable than overall casualty figures. He concludes that the French and British suffered twice as many dead as the Germans on the Western front. The ratio of losses has been argued ever since the war, and the author may be right. However, it appears the author feels that tactical superiority in battle is the basic (or only )determinant of ultimate victory in war, and experience indicates that he is mistaken in this (remember Vietnam?) Perhaps surprisingly, the author does not say anyting about the \\"stab in the back\\" theory of the German armistice request, since this would further absolve the German army of the war's outcome, but this lack may be because he essentially does not discuss homefronts at all.  Nor does he discuss the eastern front.  However, the book is written in a lively style, which is why I managed to read every word, while disapproving of the author's way of slanting information to \\"prove\\" his various theses.	2001-05-10
US	50763950	RWZW6MXGNBQ5L	0333718291	474963610	A Concise History of Byzantium (European History in Perspective)	Books	4	13	17	N	Y	An Alternate to Norwich	This book covers Byzantine history from 285 to 1453 at the rate of about 5 years per page, and in my view does a solid job of it. Obviously, many details are omitted, though I suspect anyone new to the subject might feel there is an overwhelming amount of detail.  Prof. Treadgold writes in his usual no-frills scholarly style, which I prefer to the more lively style of Norwich.  Despite the style, this book does not include much scholarly apparatus--most notably there are no footnotes.  The book is organized into 40 sections, on average about 6 pages long.  There are two introductory sections and two concluding sections.  The core of the book consists of the 36 sections between, divided into 6 chapters, each chapter covering a period of Byzantine history.  The chapters are composed of 3 to 5 narrative sections always followed by a section on society and one on culture.  The second page of each chapter has a (very good) map taken from Prof. Treadgold's longer work.  There are 12 black-and-white plates.  There is only one chart in the book and it presents statistics for area control, population, revenue, and army size at 13 points during the Empire's history. A graph repeats the area information.  There is a list of rulers appended, and a 16 page index.  The book emphazises military fortunes, emperor actions (or lack thereof), and religious disputes.  I appreciated the emphasis on military afairs, but others might not.  The overall viewpoint is the empire as seen from Constantinople.  This is not an anecdotal approach to history;  none of the colorful but dubious legends are even mentioned (no blind Belisarius).  And, for example, Prof. Treadgold's sober approach to the reign of Justinian II is in marked contrast to Lord Norwich's approach.  Which approach you prefer is a matter of taste.  I much prefer the Treadgold approach, but still felt I couldn't rate this book 5 stars.  I expect most people would find it a little dry, and the facts come perhaps too thick and fast.  But on the other hand, I also noticed a couple of omissions that I think even a beginner would notice:  the death year of Belisarius is not stated, and while Prof. Treadgold very neatly summarizes Byzantine Spain as &quot;never much more than a set of embattled outposts&quot;, he does not complete the thought with something like &quot;which were all lost by the mid 620's&quot;, and it can only be deduced from the book's maps that they were lost by 780. Minor points perhaps, but not the perfection I expected from Prof. Treadgold.  Perhaps I hold him to too high a standard!   But I will conclude by noting that I plan to start rereading the book right away.	2001-01-26
US	50763950	R3MJ1XMN8XYV6K	0760309388	256348654	World War I: Day by Day	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Quite good but a few errors	This is basically a well-written and eye-pleasing book. It is printed on slick paper with the pages being typing paper size, and about half of each page is devoted to (black and white) photographs, sidebars, and/or maps. The maps are uncluttered line drawings, while the sidebars are mostly devoted to personalities and weapons. The profiles of the leading personalities presented in these sidebars cover the major controversies as well as the major facts, and often give an assessment of the individual. The photographs, which are frequently cleverly trimmed to fit nicely into the text, are each given a one-sentence caption. The chronology itself, which spacewise occupies only about one half of the book, is brief on any one item, but covers the essentials of the war in a very readable and understandable way--in fact I read the book straight through as a short history of WWI. The only thing that keeps me from giving the book a five star rating is a few inexplicable errors, perhaps the most glaring of which is that in two separate photographs, one of the Kaiser's sons is identified as the Kaiser himself. Even so, I consider this one of the best books on WWI that I own.	2000-10-09

I enjoyed the discussion of  the secrecy aspects of the construction.  The only negatives for me were  the rather brief summary of the sinking, and the failure to put the  Musashi's mission at that time into a broader strategic framework.	2000-06-05

I am a history buff of 30 year's standing, not a professional historian, and narrative history focusing on military and political events, as this book does, is my favorite kind.  I felt the book did include a fair amount on social, particularly religous, topics, but wove them into the narrative  instead of having separate sections that did not include any narrative at  all.  The book is written in a matter-of-fact but lively and direct style.  It also includes many maps, all well done and useful. In fact, I like this  book so much, that I have replaced my original softback copy with a  hardback copy.  If I want to read about some period in Byzantine history,  Treadgold is the book I go to first.	2000-04-27
