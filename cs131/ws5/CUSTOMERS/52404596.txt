This is probably some of the material concerning Zed's early life growing up as an exterminator as well as the original purpose of the Vortex (it was created as a space ship for the cream of humanity to travel to other planets). <br />Fans of the films will find something worth digesting here whilst those that loathed the film will also loathe this novelisation. Otherwise it makes an interesting addition to an under-rated movie though would advise anyone to purchase the DVD.	2004-05-30

It looks at how political parties and advertising partnered and the effect this had on politics. The author arguement is that contempary political advertising can be traced back to the works of Nazi propagandist, Josef Goebbels, who believed that in order for good propaganda to work, it must entertain rather then inform.<br />Surprisingly the author doesn't look at the work of the Creel Commission, a body set up by Woodrow Wilson in 1917 to encourage the American population to support WW1. Another ommission is the work of the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, set up in 1937 to help the American public recognise various methods of propaganda.<br />The author reviews the years after WW2 and particulary how these techniques were used by American politicans and then picked up by their British counterparts. The most famous example being the Conservative Party partnership with Saatchi & Saatchi. <br />This book is reccomended to anyone seriously interested in political advertising, film making or jsut wanting to find out how the visual images can be used to change people's minds.	2004-05-30

Those expecting a zany account of UFO's and JFK theories will be surprised to find an informative text on the nature of conspiracy theories and why they should be taken seriously as part of the political landscape.<br />Ramsay doesn't waste his time on the 'zany' side of conspiracy theories, instead he looks at those that should be worthy for further investigation.<br />This slim volume is probably one of the most informative pocket books produced and should be a serious purchase for anyone interested in politics.<br />A reviewer mentions that she found the book worthless due to the UK bias shown by the author. I'll say this is an inaccurate statement. The author is trying to provide a concise introduction to this area. He ahould be applauded for providing clear footnotes and references that some of the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; tend to leave out and thus make it harder for readers to challenge their theories.	2004-05-30

Here he looks at the uses and abuses of the OSA.<br />Various cases are looked at and reviewed. Familiar  names pop up such as investigative journalist  Duncan Campbell and  disgraced Conservative MP Jonathan Aitken - all having had run ins with the  OSA. Also covered is the Peter Wright/Spycatcher affair, Cathy Massiter/C4  MI5 documentary and the Clive Ponting/Belgrano affair. <br />Hooper has also  gathered information of less publicised cases that have been prosecuted  under the OSA and a selection of these are published in the appendix. The  Austrailians, Canadians and the US also have their systems examined by  Hooper who compares them against the British Goverments  legislation.<br />Hooper's final conclusion is that the OSA needs to be bought  up to date and is repeatedly open to abuse by those in power. Goverments  seem to invoke the act rarely for national security and more to hide  incompetence and corruption.	2000-06-22

Here is a collection of three of Marc Behm's work and it isworth purchasing just for the excellent 'Eye of the Beholder'. Aninsane, funny and touching novel about a Private Detective (referred to as the 'Eye') obsession with a female serial killer. For over a decade, the Eye protects the woman, who is unaware that she has a guardian angel. Following the protaganists for over a decade, Behm's narrative holds your attention as he describes the Eye's fragmenting mental state when confronted with infatuation and desire.  Ignore the recent Ewan McGregor/Ashley Judd film and read the book. <br />I wish I could say the same for Queen of the Night but I found it quite distasteful. It is the story of a woman who gets mixed up with the Nazi party during WW II. Maybe it does say something about the psychology of the German psyche but I found it bordering on cheap porn.  Maybe for those who like watching dubious films like Helga: She Wolf of the SS.<br />The Ice Maiden is a story about a Vampire who works as a Croupier.  Originally published in French, this was its first English language release.	2000-06-22

He interviews quite a few 'new' screenwriters including Dan O' Bannon (Alien), Daniel Pyne(White Sands), Greg Widen(Highlander) and the writing duo of Jack Epps  and Jim Cash (the original writers of Top Gun). These writers are  succesful, talented but they don't really have that much to say about  screenwriting. <br />One of the appeal of the first book was to read  interviews with writers who had already written classics such as 'The  Apartment' and 'The Great Escape'. To hear what they thought about the  process of screenwriting. With this book, it mostly concentrates on the  interviewees careers. A real mixed bag but still well worth exploring.	2000-05-30

Are you the kind of person who buy Serial Killer weekly (Issue #1 with free collectors binder and piano wire) and feel that the dark side of  humanity is a subject worth exploring, that serial killers are actually  quite intelligent, Nietzchean supermen? Well this book is for you!   <br />Otherwise, stay away. Not even useful for research, this exploitive  little tome graphically details all kinds of sexual violence against women  that seems to be there for cheap titillation. Its the kind of book you'll  see on the supermarket book rack next to 'The History of Canabalism!',  'Great Paedophiles of our Time' and 'The Vannesa Feltz Story'. <br />Written  with some co-operation with members of the FBI Behavioural Science Unit,  this book was published with the sudden interest in serial killers during  the release of Silence Of The Lambs. A film that romantises and perpetuates  the myth of the serial killer as a man above all others. Wilson and Seaman  examine cases of killers who try and do just that. Maybe their intention  was to demystify this particular myth but what we get is just graphic  accounts of murder and sexual violence that verges on pornography. The kind  of book that would grace the shelf of some smug armchair amatuer  psychologist whose never faced true violence. Colin Wilson has written some  interesting books but this isn't one of them.	2000-05-13

From his days doing Montage sequences for some classic films (i.e. The Raging Twenties) to getting his first directors gig from the wary studio mogols.  <br />Siegel is an entertaining writer but you feel as if your not getting the  full picture from him. Details are skipped over and lost. Some infamous  people emerge (i.e. Sam Peckinpah, Ronald Regan, etc.) but other stuff is  neglected. For example, I don't think Siegel even mentions John Milius'  contribution to Dirty Harry. Peckinpah's trouble with studio brass is  hardly covered but there is some interesting stuff on the making of Charley  Varrick and The Shootist. <br />Theres not much information for those  interested in film making, but for light reading I would recomend the book  but just don't expect too much.	2000-05-08

A paranoid collegue warns him about the mysterious deaths of  the other witnesses and it isn't long before the Parralax Corparation  become involved.<br />Then the story gets weird. The hero is first involved in  the murder of a low level employee of the company before he and his  collegue are pitted against each other. Unlike the film, the main character  does meet the head of the company who reveals the aim of the company to be  a social engineering group designed to control democracy.  Also, he has an  affair with the widow of the man he killed and later saves her sons life.<br />The book's main assasination is modelled on the JFK killing while the  film was on RFK. There are major differences in plot and structure and I  would estimate that probably over 80% percent of the book was thrown out by  the screenwriters.<br />Singer has written is a earnest and entertaining  thriller that has none of the cyncial downbeat edge of the film. I should  not really compare the two but as the book has been out of print for so  long, I thought readers would like to know as much as possible about the  original source.	2000-05-08

I managed to find a copy and was impressed with the work that Dixon had done on the subject.<br />Dixon analyses various military campaigns and provides his conclusion to why these ventures failed. various different reasons are  cited in each case but there are certain common factors that Dixon  isolates. From the Crimea to the blood baths at Somme and Arnhem.  Dixon  asks how competent officers and soldiers be let down by an inflexible  militery guidelines of the period.<br />For example, Dixon is critical of the  class selection of military 'leaders'. &quot;Natural leaders may well have  made good captains of a first XV,&quot; writes Dixon, &quot;But being good  at rugger in no way ensures the best quality of military leadership...  Napoleon, Nelson, Wolfe for instance-were men of brain and character, not  of huge bodies with dazzling records in the field of sport&quot;.<br />Dixon  explains his findings in a clear and lucid manner that is understandable to  anyone with a basic knowledge of psychology. The best recomendation I could  have for Dixon's book is that his findings do not apply to military  campaigns alone. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has ever worked  on a film set. Frankly, I would shove this book to any future wannabe  producer/director. it could save people a lot of hassle if they applied  most of Dixon's findings.	2000-04-11

This was the magazine that first published articles and evidence from former Army PR man, Colin Wallace of a attempt by certain members of UK Intelligence against Harold Wilson's goverment  (The same allegations later re-surfaced in Peter Wrights memoirs,  Spycatcher).<br />Dorrill has produced a book that gives a general overview of  workings of UK intelligence. From the Cathy Massiter affair to the death of  Ian Spiro, Dorrill introduces readers to stories that haven't had the  attention they should have deserved.<br />Some people might be upset by what  he writes.

So much so that I am still (Part-Time) interviewing and researching a book on the making of the film.<br />Ed Naha has written a competent and informative book in the  same standard as other 'Making of...' books.

This is, and never was, to be like 'The Devil's Candy'. <br />We are given  plenty of anecdotes concerning the making of the film and a very  informative first section concerning the earlier attempts to film 'Dune'.  We are also treated to description of scenes that were later discarded  during the editing of the film. <br />For those who are still interested in  more information about David Lynch's film, I would reccomend them to look  at Harlan Ellison's two part essay on the film (to be found in 'Watching'),  Frank Herbert's intro to 'Eye' and Paul M.

In it,  Knightly snipes at Hemingway for not reporting during the Spanish Civil War  but keeping material for his books while admiring Martha Glehorn's coverage  of the Vietnam war (which later got her expelled from the country).<br />For  those interested in Media Ethics and journalism, Knightly's book is highly  recomended.	2000-03-20
