There is one exception, however, and that is this book. I absolutely love this book. It tells the story of a Polish girl named Anetka Kaminska, who travels to America with her little brother to reunite with her Tata (father), who has been living and working there for some time now. Traveling with Anetka and her brother is the handsome Leon Nasevich, a soldier of the Russian army. He goes with them after he gets into some trouble with the law in Poland and cannot stay there. Once in America, Anetka is to marry a coal miner twice her age who has three little daughters from his first marriage (she finds this out AFTER she meets him), and who she does not even know, much less love. There is also another problem: Anetka finds herself falling for Leon.  <br /> <br />This is a great historical fiction novel filled with lots of details and romance. You should definitely buy this book, it is worth your money.	2005-08-19

The young and beautiful Miss Lucy Honeychurch, accompanied by her dear older friend Miss Bartlett, is first introduced to the reader in Florence, just arrived at the pension they will be staying at during the course of their holiday in Italy. The ladies are vexed to find that they have not received rooms with the views they wished for; overhearing them, an elderly man and his son offer to trade rooms with them, for they have rooms with perfect views; and hence the title of the book.<br /> This is when Lucy first meets George Emerson, an attractive, if not unconventional, young Englishman. Lucy encounters him again when she witnesses a public murder in the streets, and George attends to her after she faints. This is when his passion for her is first ignited. This inward flame is only stoked more when he and his father are accidentally invited on a daily outing with Lucy and her friends, and George sees Lucy alone in a field full of flowers, beautiful and surrounded by beauty. He cannot help but kiss her, which is entirely un-gentleman-like. Miss Bartlett witnesses George's display of affection, and decides that to keep her young companion's innocence safe from George's intentions, the two of them must leave immediately for Rome, without so much as a goodbye to George or his father, and stay with some family friends, the Vyses.<br /><br />The story opens up again in a quiet, small neighborhood in the country, with Miss Lucy Honeychurch engaged to Cecil Vyse, whom she became better acquainted with in Rome. Then, by mere coincidence--or is it fate?--George Emerson and his father, whom Lucy never expected to see again, reenter into her life, and complicate things. Should Lucy flout convention and follow her heart, which is leading her to George, or will she remain with Cecil, the safe and respectable choice, who she knows can never make her truly happy?<br /><br />Find out for yourself! Forster does a great job of painting with certain clarity and humor the scenes and characters of this story. This classic is a breath of fresh air, and I'm sure that even if you aren't a huge fan of British Literature, you will love it.nting with certain clarity and humor the scenes and characters of this story.

I first read this book I was in the 6th grade, and I recently bought it and read it again. I have to say, I liked it better the first time round. But that might have been because I was younger, and this book seems suited for the pre-teen, young teen audience.  <br /> <br />The book I recently bought was different from when I read it in 6th grade--the cover was different, and I was disappointed because this edition seemed cheaply made--the cover was flimsy, and the binding wasn't very tight. Oh, well, that doesn't matter too much. Onto the story. <br /> <br />This is the story of Molly, who is extremely afraid of water and has had the same nightmare over and over for as long as long as she can remember. Then she meets Jared, her friend's cousin, and she has a strange urge to call him \\"Hob\\" and they both feel like they already know each other, even though they have never met before. <br /> <br />Molly goes to her friend's pool party, and Jared is there. When she won't get into the pool, he suddenly grabs her and throws her in the water. She sinks to the bottom and blacks out. Luckily Jared gives her mouth-to-mouth and she's ok. Molly decides to visit her dad and new stepmom in Maine for the summer, partly to recover from her scare. She is furious with Jared, and never wants to see him again. <br /> <br />When Molly arrives in the little town in Maine, strange things begin happening to her. She experiences something like flashbacks, except she is not herself--she is Clementine, a girl who lived in the same house as Molly's father with her uncle's family, a long time ago. Molly also realizes that the nightmares she has been experiencing are connected with Clementine and her house.  <br /> <br />Jared comes to visit Molly in Maine, and tells her that he has been experiencing the same feelings, about a young man named Hob, who knew Clementine. Something tragic happened in this little town involving both Clementine and Hob, and Molly and Jared begin to piece together the clues, while finding that their feelings for each other have been growing stronger.	2005-08-18

Ok, true, this is a bit more creepy than some of the author's other works, and just creepy in general for little kids...but it is still an excellent book! Just don't read it to your kids at night! This book is a brilliant work of art, wiith its horror undertones. Some people are just sick of reading the same old fairy tales and this is the perfect book to pick up if you're looking for something different. And it really sticks with you, too. I haven't read this book in years, but I can still see the pictures vividly in my mind; can still hear the first lines of the book echoing through my head as I write this review. The pictures are extraordinary--they are what gives the readers shivers. I especially love the picture in which the goblins replace the main character's baby brother with an ice baby.    I definitely recommend this book to anyone, even for adults' pleasure, it's just maybe not for really young children.    I wrote this review partly to chastise the readers who can't seem to get past the fact that this story is a little scary and see this book for what it truly is.	2005-08-17

It gives a nice, brief look at what life was like back then, and a glimpse at what the disaster of 1906 was like.  <br />However, I think this is only worthy of four or four and a half stars, because it is way too short to really get all the historical details, of the different lifestyles of that time period, and the earthquake.  <br />Also, the romance aspect seems pretty unrealistic. I mean, after 2 days of really knowing each other, the two main characters decide to get married? But if you forget about how long they've really known each other, the romance is sweet.  <br />I definitely recommend reading this book, even buying it, because it is a really good, if not short, read!	2005-08-17

I bought this book because I LOVED Dunkle's 'The Hollow Kingdom.' <br />This was a nice, quick read, but I think it fell a *tiny* bit short of 'The Hollow Kingdom.' I don't know why I feel that way, but I think 'By These Ten Bones' doesn't have as much detail, and doesn't have as colorful a setting. I also think it could've been longer. <br /> <br />I DID like the setting (a small village in ancient Scotland), and the cover art is beautiful. I also liked Dunkle's descriptions of the werewolves, how it is like an evil spirit--or, shadow--that takes over a living body. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend buying this book, but my favorite by this author is still 'The Hollow Kingdom.'	2005-08-16

However, the book description on the back of the book was a little deceptive when it said that the story \\"simmers with daring, mystery, and romance.\\" In truth, there was actually very little of any of these things, and practically NO romance whatsoever. <br /> <br />I DID like how the story told readers a lot about Pagans and their Wiccan religion, incorporating different rituals, chants, and the origin of Wicca into the story, and that is why I gave the book four stars. If you are interested in learning about religions, especially Wicca, this would be a good, informative book to read.	2005-08-01

This book has such vivid descriptions of Sea Forest that the fictional world comes to life immediately. I LOVED the setting, and the characters!  <br /> <br />The main characters are Mahri, a water-rat, and Korl, the Prince of Sea Forest and a Healer.  <br />One night Mahri sneaks up to the Healer Tree in the city to kidnap a Healer to save her village and family. Mahri has a high tolerance of zabbaroot, which allows her to See and have magical powers, but water-rats and commoners are not allowed the knowledge of the root, nor is it legal for them to use it or sell it. Mahri has a very stong tolerance for the zabbaroot, but she does not know how to use it to heal her family from a deadly disease that has spread through the swamps. Her lifemate and young child have already died a horrible death because she was unable to save them, and she vows to not let the same thing happen to her lifemate's family. <br /> <br />This is the reason that Mahri decides to kidnap a Healer that no one will notice is missing...instead she kidnaps Prince Korl, and has the royals after her. Mahri curses her luck...but what she doesn't know is that the natives of Sea Forest have brought Korl and Mahri together, because she is his soul's other half. <br /> <br />The arrogant Prince falls in love with Mahri instantly, even though she is just a water-rat, as he is constantly reminding her. But stubborn Mahri will not give in to her feelings for Korl, and only admits to a physical attraction. <br /> <br />Korl and Mahri have many adventures in the beautiful and mysterious swamps, and when they reach Mahri's village and find her niece deathly ill, the two agree to Bond, which is the only way to heal the little girl. No one has Bonded in years because the Bond links two minds together for life, and once one of them dies, so will the other.  <br /> <br />Still, Mahri resists Korl, and Korl is angered because usually he gets anything he wants, and he vows that he will make Mahri love him. <br /> <br />I won't give anything else away, but this is a VERY good fantasy/science fiction that I recommend to anyone who likes romances, because this is first and foremost a romance, with some sexual scenes interspersed throughout the story. This story, ESPECIALLY the setting, is absolutely breathtaking and unforgettable, and you won't want to miss it. I really hope that this author will write another book like this one soon.	2005-08-01

Carolina Francesca Santoro is a 43-year-old Italian-American woman who lives in Tulsa Oklahoma and owns a bakery called Pani Del Goddess. After Lina realizes that her business is in major debt and she might have to declare bankruptcy, she decides that she needs to expand her menu to make more money for her business. After looking through half a dozen old Italian cookbooks from a used book store, Lina opens a cookbook entitled The Italian Goddess Cookbook and finds a recipe for Italian pizza. The recipe involves chanting to the Goddess of the Harvest, Demeter. (One problem I had was that the author didn't use Demeter's and Persephone's Italian names, Ceres and Proserpine, but that's not really a big deal). By saying this chant and asking for help with her bakery, Lina got Demeter's attention, and the Goddess decides to switch Lina and Persephone. The dead souls of the Underworld are calling to Demeter because they want the comfort of a goddess, and Demeter believes that her daughter Persephone, Goddess of Spring, could light the darkness in the Underworld. However, Persephone is young and immature, and Demeter decides to send her to the mortal's world to experience life there, and manage Lina's bakery. In the meantime, Lina will switch places with Persephone to return Demeter's favor, and will visit the Underworld as the Goddess of Spring for six months.<br /><br />Lina and Hades soon find that they are falling in love, but Lina's conscience can't rest because she promised Demeter that she won't let anyone know that she isn't really Persephone, but she longs to tell Hades. She is also worried that Hades only loves her for her body, which is really Persephone's. The other problem is that Lina has to leave Hades and the Underworld forever in 6 months.<br /><br />While I liked P.C. Cast's first book, Goddess by Mistake, it seemed a little long-winded and dull at points. After reading this book, I see that Cast has polished her writing skills a lot since then. Goddess of Spring flows MUCH better, and I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />I also think that Cast fares very well in writing about classical mythology.

When she goes to an auction and sees the replica of a Celtic pot with the image of the High Priestess of Epona, Celtic Horse Goddess engraved into it, she purchases it because the woman looks surprisingly like herself, and it seems like the pot is calling to her. On the way home, with the Vase in the passenger seat, the sky suddenly darkens and opens up in torrents of rain, and Shannon feels the heat of fire covering her right before she crashes.  <br /> <br />When she awakens, she realizes that the High Priestess of Epona, Rhiannon, has switched places with Shannon. Shannon is now in the ancient world of Partholon, where mythology is a reality. And the strange thing is that there are mirror images of people from Shannon's life living in Partholon! For example, Shannon's best friend back in her old life is Suzanna, and Rhiannon's maid, Alanna, looks and acts exactly like her! Rhiannon is Shannon's mirror image, but they are very different in personality. Rhiannon is a cold, evil woman who slept around with all of her serving men and warriors. <br /> <br />Only a few days after Shannon has entered this new realm, she learns that she is to become Hanfasted (married for a year) with a shaman centaur named ClanFintan, according to tradition. It is not surprising that at first ClnFintan acts cold toward Shannon, because Rhiannon did not want to go through with the ceremony and acted cold toward him, but soon ClanFintan realizes that Rhiannon (really Shannon) has changed, and they begin to fall in love. <br /> <br />However, a dark evil threatens the beautiful, mystical land of Partholon--a race of beings known as Fomorians, somewhat like vampires, begin attacking castles throughout the land, and they seem unstoppable. Shannon, who soon realizes that SHE, not Rhiannon, is the Goddess Epona's Chosen and Beloved, must do everything she can to rid her new world of these ruthless creatures. <br /> <br /> <br />This is the first book I read by P.C. Cast, and I found that while it had a very good plot line, it seemed a little long-winded, with the main character trying too hard to be witty, and the author kept repeating herself over and over again, especially when she kept talking about Superman, John Wayne, and how \\"big\\" ClanFintan was. I found myself becoming a little exhausted. However, the story picked up its pace and made me want to keep reading as it hurtled toward a great ending. <br />	2005-07-19

The same goes for Hermes, who says his father is Zeus, but he doesn't have any special powers in this book. The author did I really good job in portraying the ancient city of Hellas, and the people's belief in their gods, and also the people's lifestyles and characters. The book made for a very interesting read. <br /> <br />However, I found the book somewhat lacking as a romance--I expected the romance factor to be a major part of the book, but it just didn't really feel like it was. If you're really into Greek mythology, and go into this book looking for a nice retelling of the myth, you will be very much satisfied-- but you might be disappointed if you are just looking for a romance novel. <br /> <br />I think the book description on the back of the book is a little deceiving, because it makes the reader think this is predominantly a romance: \\"Then Persephone meets the dark, mysterious lord of the underworld--and discovers a passion of mythic dimensions...Courting Persephone as no man has ever dared, he brings her to the wondrously startling revelation that bad boys can be fun...\\"	2005-07-19

Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down until I had read the entire book. From this book, I was able to taste the real flavor of the south, and the life of a cowboy on the prairie. Something about that wide open expanse of land and that bright sun shining in the blue sky, with dozens of hot cowboys riding their horses just does it for me.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to give a summary of the book, because plenty of other reviews already have, but I will tell you what I loved about this book.  <br /> <br />It was so fun to see how the main character convinced the cowhands that she was a boy. And when the boys stripped down in front of \\"Sam\\" to take a dip in the river--not knowing she was a girl...now that was priceless! <br /> <br />And when Matt found out that Sam was a girl after he saved her from the river...and suddenly began noticing her soft \\"girlish\\" features, such as her beautiful green eyes, delicate hands, and of course her curves. He was furious of course, because she had lied to him, but he was instantly attracted to her and couldn't stop thinking about how much he wanted to hold her. This made it extremely difficult for Matt to decide whether or not he would give Samantha's secret away, which would cause her to be kicked off the cattle drive and destroy her chances for earning the lifesaving $100 dollars for her struggling family. <br /> <br />Well, I don't want to give the whole book away, so I'll let you read it yourself, and leave you by telling you that this was a funny, colorful, romantic story set against the backdrop of the South after the Civil War. <br /> <br />And if you love this book, you will probably also love Lorraine Heath's other Avon True Romance Novel for Teens, called Amelia and the Outlaw. <br />	2005-07-06

I was afraid that this would be a cheesy cheap romance with no substance, but I was definitely wrong! <br /> <br />This story is about Lady Victoria Arbuthnot, who grew up in India with her uncles after her parents died, and at age 16 travels back to London to live with her aunt's family. On the ship that takes her to London, Victoria meets Lord Malfrey, and he proposes to her on the ship deck after just three months. Victoria accepts, but in part just to make the infuriating and handsome Captain Jacob Carstairs mad. Captain Carstairs is always teasing Victoria with a twinkle in his eye, and always smirks at her, which makes her hate him. Luckily, Victoria thinks she will never have to see him again when she gets off the ship. Unfortunately, Victoria's aunt and her family are great friends with Captain Carstairs, so she'll be seeing plenty of him.  <br /> <br />Captain Carstairs continually tries to convince Victoria to break her engagement with Lord Malfrey, and not go through with the marriage, because he knows that he is only in it for wealthy Victoria's money. However, Victoria doesn't realize that Carstairs is right; nor does she realize that he is in love with her. <br /> <br />Finally Victoria realizes that Jacob Carstairs is telling the truth, and she also realizes how delicious his kisses are, when one night Jacob can't hold in his feelings any longer. <br /> <br />This is not the end of the story, however. Fortunately, it is just the beginning, and the Victoria and Jacob don't just end up living happily ever after--yet. There is another big...conflict that occurs that I don't want to give away because it's really interesting.  <br /> <br />Gosh, there's so many more things I could say about this wonderful book, but I'll just sum everything up by saying that the setting is great (I love historical fiction romances) and really fleshed out; and Victoria and Jacob Carstairs' sort of love/hate relationship, with Jacob's passion for Victoria, is so romantic. *sigh*	2005-07-06

I was anxious to read this book because it sounded so interesting! Unfortunately, it wasn't at all what I expected. I expected great detail, especially about the darkangel himself, but never got any. The darkangel made few appearances, and the detial wasn't the best. Even the writing seemed a little awkward at times...truthfully, I think that many of the sentences weren't even written correctly. However, even when I got through half of the book and nothing extremely interesting had happened, I still allowed myself to hope, because for some reason the writing drew me in, as did the plot. This plot had so much potential, but the writer really fell short. I was really dismayed at the lack of interaction between the main character and the darkangel!  <br /> <br />Overall, it wasn't that bad of a book, it just didn't meet my expectations: I just wish the story had been told a bit better.

Kathleen was preparing to close the library when somebody returned five grisly books about death. One was slashed. All were overdue. Then Kathleen found the bookmark with the deadly warning. Now people close to her are falling victim to tragic accidents. Someone is out for blood. Is it Robin, silent, shy, withdrawn? Is it Alexander, the dark, handsome stranger who haunts the library stacks and says he wants to help? Kathleen can count on only one thing: the killer WILL strike again--her death is overdue....\\" <br /> <br />Kathleen is working at the creepy old library in town during spring break while the librarian, Miss Finch, attends a seminar. Working with Kathleen is her good friend Robin, a shy, mute young man who always listens to what Kathleen has to say. Then one night someone drops off several long overdue books on murders and torture, with pictures cut out of them, and Kathleen begins to feel uneasy when she finds a bookmark in one of them that reads, \\"Horrors Await You. Beware.\\" Soon Kathleen's friends begin to get fatally injured, and at every accident site, she finds a book that has to do with the way her friends are being hurt. Who is doing this? Is it Alexander, a college guy who has started hanging around the library? Is it Bran, Kathleen's hot lifelong best friend? Or is it Robin, silent and withdrawn? <br /> <br />The ending was really great, and I never guessed who the killer was. I'm so glad I read this; I almost didn't, because I thought the title was pretty stupid, but I was wrong! Definitely worth anyone's money!	2005-02-28

This book is about Princess Torina, whose father (King Kareed of Archeld) defeated the peaceful land of Bellandra, home of the fabled powerful Sword of Bellandra. When he returns from his conquest, Torina's father brings a crystal in which Torina can see things that will happen (she realizes she is a Seer), and he also brings the son of Bellandra's defeated king to be a slave for Torina. However, Torina frees Landen immediately and becomes his friend. Then, trouble starts. King Kareed's right-hand man stirs up trouble because of his hunger for the Sword and power, bringing harm to the royal family and threatening the kingdom of Archeld. Landon, accused of having caused the trouble, flees. Torina and Landen must join together to save the kingdom of Archeld and rid it of this evil man (I don't want to give away who it is). I definitely recommend buying this book, because it is full of adventure and it has some romance too.	2005-01-22

This is the first book I have read by Tamora Pierce, but let me assure you, it will not be my last. Though I am still 40 or so pages away from completing this book, I couldn't restrain myself any longer from gushing about what a wonderful novel it is! I wouldn't mind reading 10 books like this one, with its lush descriptions of the land and wonderful wording, and strong, independent female characters. I was a little nervous about this book when I first picked it up, figuring that it might be too heavy a dose of fantasy for me, but I am so glad I gave it a chance! I will definitely read this book's sequel (Trickster's Queen), because I find that as I am nearing the end of this book, at times I just have to set it down and take a break from it, because I simply don't want it to end! Definitely give this book a try, even if you are not really into the fantasy genre. This book has something for everyone, including mythological creatures, great descriptions, fully developed characters, a touch of romance, humor, and adventure that will take hold of you and make you want to continue reading. The best part of the book is seeing how cunning Aly (the main character) truly is!	2005-01-20

Parker's grandfather will pay her to organize the collection of antique books that belonged to Parker's stepmother, a Medium who died by her own hand. Suddenly Robin is plunged into Parker's dark and twisted family saga, trying to protect his stepsister Claudia who is haunted by visions of her evil mother and driven to desperation. Parker says that Claudia is crazy. But Robin has heard and seen the ghost! Now her part-time job is a full-time nightmare!\\"    After reading seven other books by Cusick, I am so used to her style of writing that this book just didn't seem like it totally hit the spot for me, but I think I can blame that partly on getting older. Don't get me wrong, I am positive that if I had read this before I had read all her others, I would have liked it a lot more. Also the ending was pretty surprising, and there was a nice twist. However (WARNING, hint of ending!),   I was mad that in the end the main character didn't even make up her mind about which guy she liked, and there was not enough romance!     If you are under the age of 16, or haven't read any other of this author's books, I would recommend this book, but some fans of Cusick's might be a bit disappointed because she has written better ones.	2005-01-03

All I knew when I first picked this book up was that 14-year-old Birle, an Innkeeper's Daughter, and a 19-year-old lord (soon to be Earl) named Orien were to have many adventures together, and there would be romance. I was pretty disappointed that there was not near as much romance as I thought there would be. However, it was still an EXCELLENT book, stuffed full of adventure! Birle and Orien encounter pirates, who sell them and cause the two to become separated. Then both of them plan to escape from their masters and head back to the Kingdom. The only problem was that I had difficulty understanding at some parts who \\"Jackaroo\\" was, which is the title of the book before this, which I have not read.  <br />I definitely recommend reading this book, it was so interesting!	2005-01-02

Lindsay's new stepfather asks his handsome best man and godson, Ryan, to look after Lindsay since she is underage. Lindsay thinks Ryan will ruin her plans, but she begins to get a crush on him.     At first I was a bit wary about reading this book, because it looks like the ultimate junky teen romance. However, it was such a delight to read! It was not at all what I expected! First of all, I expected Lindsay's new friend Brooke to be like friends usually are in books like these: a perfect, perky pretty little thing. However, Brooke is a wild chick who has dyed hair, a tattoo, and experience: totally unlike Lindsay. It was funny to see how Lindsay tried to fit in and act like Brooke, even though she was the total opposite.   I also really liked this book because not only was it about the romance between Ryan and Lindsay, it also talked about the many different things Lindsay did while on the cruise, like parasail, rockclimb, and hike a waterfall. I really loved this book, and I will definitely read it again!!	2005-01-02

It is about 16-year-old Jemima who hates her 24-year-old tutor, John Reid, mainly because he is a Tory. However, later on in the book she finds out that Mr. Reid is actually a spy for the Patriots. This is when Jemima begins to fall in love with Mr. Reid. However, this isn't even close to the end. Much of the book is about the war; Jem's brothers fighting in the war, and John and his spying.

I would have liked it better if there was more detail and if it were longer. However, several of the stories that were told within the book were actually very interesting, and I loved the setting.

I picked this up from my library one day to read over the summer, and I'm so glad I did. It didn't take me that long to read, because I really got into it. It is the story of a girl who's family are Travelers, like gypsies. They don't have real jobs, and they don't have permanent homes. They basically make their money by ripping people off and taking their money while doing odd jobs for them or selling items to them.  <br /> <br />The main character Bridget starts o question whether the life of a Traveler is the one for her. She has always wondered what it would be like to live in a real house and get an important job, and have a normal family. She wouldn't have to constantly be on the run, and she could go to the same school for more than a year and make real friends. The main character also feels a bit guilty sometimes about living this dishonest life of ripping people off. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Bridget is engaged to her older brother's friend Patrick, which was arranged by the parents of both families. Patrick is nice enough, and he's really hot, but Bridget wants to make her own choices about who she marries. <br /> <br />Then, later in the book when Bridget finds out that her family has kept a secret from her, Bridget has to make an important decision about what kind of life she wants for herself. <br /> <br />The ending was good on one hand, but on the other hand, I was upset with it. However, this is a great book that I recommend checking out from the library. It was interesting to learn how the \\"Travelers\\" lived.	2004-12-01

Unknown to her, someone else is satching. He knows she is smiling just for him. His soft, strange voice whispers her name from the crowd. His hooded eyes follow her every move....    At first she thinks he's just a creepy customer, hanging around Muffin Mania where she works at the mall. But suddenly he's everywhere, the man with a thousand faces tormenting her day and night. He knows her secrets. There's no safe place to hide. There's no one she can tell, no one she can trust. How can she escape a madman willing to kill to make her his--forevermore.\\"    This is one of the first books that I ever read by Cusick, and I liked it a lot. Trish works at the local mall with her friends Nita and Imogene. There she meets two guys, Wyatt and Storm. She kindof has this thing for Storm, but she can't trust anyone, and he seems mysterious. The reason she can't trust anyone is because there is a weird mysterious guy following her around in the mall, and other places as well. Trish starts to become paranoid, and she has good reason to. She even gets hurt by this weirdo. Read this book to find out what happens, and you won't regret it! The ending is surprising!    Richie Tankersley Cusick has got to be my favorite author. I have loved every book that I have read by her. I know many other people love her books as well, and I don't understand why her books are not being printed anymore! It's so hard to find them!    Here are the other great books that I have read by this author:  The Lifeguard  Vampire  Someone at the Door  Trick or Treat  Overdue  The Drifter  Scarecrow  Silent Stalker, which isn't as good as the others, but it is still pretty good.	2004-11-30

I love the setting, which is a \\"haunted\\" house outside of a small town, around Halloween. Martha and her dad and her new stepmom and stepbrother Conor move into this deserted house. After living in the big, lonely house for about a week, their parents go on their honeymoon, so Conor and Martha are all alone. Martha is terrified of the new house, because she thinks weird things are happening. To make matters worse, at her new school she is not doing so well. Luckily she has made a few friends: Blake, a cute guy who seems to like her, and his cousins Greg (who works at their school and is Martha's advisor), and Wynn, who is Martha's age. Martha finds out from her new friends that a girl named Elizabeth Bedford who was her age and looked a little like Martha was killed in her bedroom in the Bedford house, but no one ever found out who the killer was. I really liked this book because it was a scary, easy read that I couldn't put down, and the ending is so surprising. Richie Tankersley Cusick's other books are just as good.  <br />Try: The Lifeguard, The Mall, Someone at the Door, Vampire, and Scarecrow.	2004-11-30

This book is about a girl named Samantha who wears all black because she is \\"in mourning for her generation,\\" and only has one real friend, a girl whose mom makes her wear long skirts and makes her rest on the Sabbath. <br /> <br />This is the funny but unlikely story of how Samantha saves the president from being assassinated-and falls in love with his handsome son David. <br /> <br />After Samantha is caught spending her school time drawing and selling pictures of celebrities, her parents make her join an art class, which she thinks is a total drag because she doesn't want a teacher telling her how to draw. David, the president's son, is also in her class, although she doesn't realize who he is at first.  <br /> <br />One day, when Samantha is waiting for her housekeeper to pick her up from art class, she sees the presisent stop in a cookie store near the building while he waits for his son. Sam also sees a man pull out a gun, so she tackles him. After that, everyone loves her for saving the president. She is even invited to dinner at the White House with her family! This is when she starts to become friends with David. <br /> <br />There is a little problem: David later finds out that Sam is using him to get back at her older sister's boyfriend Jack, who she totally adores and is in love with. <br /> <br />This book is really thick and was fun to read because it had a light tone.

The main characters in the story are adults (not old, though), and it wasn't written like many of the other books I have read by Richie Tankersley Cusick. However, I found myself getting into the story and really liking it, even though it didn't have romance in it (at first). This book is actually creepy and gory (somewhat), and scary, and a little sad. <br /> <br />The main character, whose husband and son died, and she is still really sad about it, for some reason is at a farmhouse in the Ozarks in the middle of nowhere (I think she crashed her car)with a strange family. The little six-year-old girl can tell the future, a young boy is treated terribly by his mother for no reason (when you find out the reason, you'll be very surprised!), and the father seems controlling. Every year the family makes scarecrows, but he orders them all to be burned at the end of the year, which the main character finds very strange. There is also the mother's sweet, much younger sister, who is very normal and wants to get out into the real world, where she has never been (the family really is cut off from all other people), but her sister forbids it. When it is time for all of the scarecrows to be burned, the younger sister hides hers and doesn't burn it, because she so desperately wants a guy friend. <br /> <br />The main character begins to really get freaked out when she realizes that the family does not want her to leave their home, and she knows she is in danger. <br /> <br />This book is very well written, with great detail. All of the elements are woven together neatly, and the ending will amaze you. All of the answers to why this family is so strange will reveal themselves. I strongly recommend this book, also if you have strong, um, morals (?) this might not be a good book for you.	2004-11-28

But, not wanting to be cruel to the poor child, who had no where to go, they took her in and began to raise her properly. Anne has many exciting adventures in this story, including getting in a fight with Gilbert, a boy from school; Anne getting stuck out on the water after she plays with her friends that she is dead while lying in a canoe; and Anne trying to die her red hair, which she hates.<br /><br />I love this version of the book, because it is hardback and has many black and white pictures, and a few colored pictures to keep readers interested.

The whole book takes place in about 2 days, in which the main character, Anna, flies to LA to live with her dad for a while, attends an Oscar winner's wedding (how did that happen? Oh yeah, that guy she met on the plane only hours before invited her), go to an after-party, and spend the night with that guy she barely knows on a boat. What more could possibly be squeezed into that small time period? You'd be amazed how a teenager can do that much and more (realistically) in that period of time. NOT. On top of all that, the ending of this book is horrible. I know there is a sequel, but the author could have at least made the reader actually want to open the next book. If you are looking for a more realistic and interesting book (with a longer time-period than 2 days) along these lines, try the Gossip Girl series, especially the second and third ones. As for me, I don't think I want to chance reading the second A-List.	2004-11-25

Mary goes to live with her aunt Nora, who has been in America for 6 years already. Mary's older sister, Kate, has been in America for 2 years. Mary starts work in a mill and plans to save enough money for her parents to come to America. <br /> <br />This book was a very quick read, but it didn't seem like much happened at all. It is so short! Also, it seems like something might happen between Mary and this boy she met on the ship named Sean, but they never see each other again after they get off the ship. A few letters are exchanged between Mary and Sean's uncle, Mr. Quinn, but that's it. This book was also not that good because the ending is so abrupt! I didn't even know it was the end until I looked at the next page and was surprised to see that it was the Epilogue. It seems like Mr. Denenberg just stopped writing in the middle of the story. So many more things could have happened. In addition, the Epilogue was horrible. This is a fiction book, so I don't see why the author had to make it so disappointing. <br /> <br />This is not one of the better Dear America books, but I think it would be interesting for nine-year-olds or around that age. I don't recommend buying it, though.	2004-11-24

Polly is not from the city, and this might help to explain why she dresses simply and has old-fashioned ideas. Therefore, it is a bit hard for Polly to fit in with Fanny and her rich friends. Join Polly on her adventures with the whole Shaw family, including Fanny, Tom, and Maud.     Before Polly realizes it, it is time for her to return home. The story opens back up six years later when Polly comes back to the city to work as a teacher, and visits the Shaw family once again and is involved in many more adventures. An older man starts to fall in love with Polly, just when her affections for Tom (Fanny's borther) are growing stronger. Who will she end up with?

Towards the end, the main character realizes that her father was actually a rich man who was related to a relative of her adoptive family, which entitles her to lots of money. <br /> <br />Despite the unrealistic perfectness of the main character, this book is a very enjoyable read. If nothing else, check it out at the library, but I plan to buy it when I get the money.	2004-11-24

My sister received this book at the same time that I received \\"Treasury of Fairy Tales.\\" Although I personally like the Fairy Tales better, this book has as many great, colorful pictures as the other one, and they differ in the style of drawings, which I liked. This had a few of the stories that are in the Treasury of Fairy Tales, which I enjoyed comparing the story and pictures to. Treasury of Bedtime Stories is indeed a remarkable book filled with great stories to keep the children interested. The stories in this book are: <br />Goldilocks and the Three Bears <br />Hansel and Gretel <br />Henny Penny <br />Puss in Boots <br />Jack and the Beanstalk <br />The Little Red Hen <br />Snow White <br />The Three Little Pigs <br />The Tortoise and the Hare <br />The Steadfast Tin Soldier <br />Cinderella <br />The Ugle Duckling <br />The Pied Piper of Hamelin <br />The Sleeping Beauty <br />Rumpelstiltskin <br />The Three Billy Goayts Gruff <br />Beauty and the Beast <br />Little Red Riding Hood <br />The Gingerbread Man <br /> <br />I can't choose a favorite out of these, because they are all really great, but the ones that I think have the best pictures are Beauty and the Beast, Goldilocks, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty. <br /> <br />This is a book that I strongly recommend be bought for your children, because they will thank you when they are older for giving them the opportunity to grow up with this book.	2004-11-24

I absoutely love this book and still read it, and I am 16 years old, thats just how good it is. I especially love the colorful, detailed pictures on every other page that will keep little kids entertained. The stories in it are: <br />Beauty and The Beast <br />Rapunzel <br />Aladdin <br />The Sleeping Beauty <br />Cinderella <br />The Princess and the Pea <br />Snow White <br />The Steadfast Tin Soldier <br />Thumbelina <br />The Frog Prince <br />Pinocchio <br />The Emperor's New Clothes <br />The Little Mermaid <br />The Jungle Book <br />The Twelve Dancing Princesses <br />Peter Pan <br />Robin Hood <br />The Velveteen Rabbit <br /> <br />My personal favorite in this book is The Twelve Dancing Princesses because of the beautiful pictures and because I had never heard the story anywhere else. <br /> <br />The book is hardback, and the edges of the pages are gold. It is a nice, big square book. <br />I strongly recommend buying this book for your child, for I know it is something they will cherish it forever, as I know I will!	2004-11-24
US	27104640	R1IANT2IDN237H	0141439513	503057596	Pride and Prejudice	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A difficult read, but a great classic	Pride and Prejudice is mainly focused on Elizabeth Bennet and her romance with Mr. Darcy, which comes about in a very interesting, if not humorous way. Elizabeth first judges Mr. Darcy to be arrogant and conceited, while Mr. Darcy finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. Another main character is Elizabeth's sister, Jane, who has a troubled relationship with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's friend. Many exciting events take place involving the many sisters of the Bennet family in this great English story that will keep advanced readers interested.<br /><br />I have to admit, this was a very difficult book. I struggled through most of it, and I like this book much better now that I am finished with it. I guess that means that I like the story, but it took a while to get through reading it. One downside was that there was not much said describing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's romance. That might have been somewhat due to the time period in which this story was written. However, I really enjoyed the great detail, which allowed Austen to paint an amazing picture of society in that time period and middle-class expectations. I bought this book, which I am glad I did, because I plan to read it again. This definitely seems like it's one of those books that the reader will enjoy more the second time it is read.	2004-11-23

How did this happen to her? Now she will have to choose who to live with, and there's the problem of what her friends will think once she tells them. So when Valerie's dad says he is moving to some tiny country that no one has heard of because of his new job (protocol chief for royal family), she decides to go with him because, let's face it, who wants to live with their lesbian mother and her girlfriend and transfer to a new school? Although Valerie is upset because she has to leave her friends and a potential boyfriend named David, she soon realizes that living in this new country could get pretty interesting, considering there is a young prince her age living in the palace (Valerie and her father have an apartment there since her father works for the royal family). The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because it is somewhat predictable, but it is still worth your money to buy it.	2004-11-22

It is the story of seventeen-year-old Darcy, who is dumped by her mother at her handsome Uncle Jake's house, who is just 6 years older than her. There, she becomes friends with Brandon, the dark-haired, hot, guy who is already taken, but likes Darcy; Liz, the spoiled girlfriend of Brandon who is used to getting what she wants and does not have any real friends; Kyle, the sweet brother of Liz; and Elliott, the weird young man who never takes off his sunglasses and seems to follow Darcy around. Meanwhile, girls are being murdered in the town and left with slits in their throats and marks that look like a vampire's. Strange things start happening to Darcy, and at first everyone thinks she is overreacting. When Darcy finds a note saying \\"You are my chosen one,\\" she must hurry to find who is doing the killing before she is next. This book has romance and suspense, and it keeps you guessing until the end. I think this book is somewhat hard to find, but I ordered it off amazon.com and am thankful I did.	2004-11-22

It is the story of a girl named Carley who meets a guy named Kyle at the hospital, and they become close friends. Carley's in the hospital because her leg got infected after she broke it. There is problem: Kyle is very cute, but he is temporarily blind due to a chemisty experiment gone bad. Therefore, he cannot see that Carley has a facial deformity. Carley is afraid that once Kyle's bandages are removed from his eyes, he won't like her anymore. I won't give anymore away, because you should go out and buy this book and read it yourself! I promise that you will not regret it!	2004-11-21

Julie leaves her home to go visit her pen pal because her father has gone, and she is married to a boy that does not treat her well. On the way, Julie gets lost and has to depend on a pack of wolves to survive. Using her father's words on how to befriend wolves, Julie, becomes one of the pack as she tries to find her way to San Francisco. There are some sad parts to this book, but I really love the great descriptions of the land and the wolves. Definitely a book that will warm your heart.	2004-11-21

I've read other reviews about this book saying that Phillis was a spoiled brat, but I disagree. She seems like a very normal girl. I personally did not like Nathaniel all that much. He seemed like he was always being subtly mean to her, although I do realize that he was trying to tell her what the real world was like. Towards the end I personally though it was sad and I even cried, although I wouldn't say it was THAT sad. But I read the author's note afterwards, and that just made me depressed...Still, I recommend this book because it is very interesting and informative about the first black American poet.	2004-11-21

This book is about Hannah and her younger sister Meg who is in ninth grade. They get stranded at home during a huge blizzard, and their parents are not home (I forget where they are), so it is just the two of them and their dog. To make matters worse, the two girls heard on the radio that there is a killer loose.     The first night of the blizzard, there is a knock on the door. Two young men, Lance and Jonathon, have been hurt and need a place to stay to wait out the blizzard. At first Hannah is wary about letting them in the house since they are strangers, but she lets them in anyways. During the next few days, strange things begin to happen that can't be explained. Hannah doesn't know who to suspect for these strange happenings, especially because she doesn't even know these two guys.     The ending of this book is very brilliant and unpredictable, simply because it does not end like usual scary stories. On the other hand, the ending was a bit disappointing to me because it wasn't as fun as I had hoped it to be. However, I am sure that this is because I have read too many generic horror stories. I really think that fans of Cusick's will enjoy it, but it was not my favorite book written by her.	2004-11-21

I really liked reading this book because it talked about a young girl's life growing up in a family of women, which is something I believe many teenaged girls can at least partially relate to. I really liked how not one bit of it was boring. The author kept it interesting by meshing the main character's grandmother's doctoral experiences with the entire family's daily life. I especially enjoyed how towards the end the author created a bit of a romance between the main character and a young man. Overall, this book is something I could read again in a few years without getting bored with it:).	2004-11-16

I bought this book, and I regret doing so because I did not enjoy it.     In this book, the main cahracter is a girl named Cyd, who I guess is punk/gothic. When Cyd's behavior gets out of control, her parents send her to live with her real dad named Frank, who she hasn't seen in about 10 years and lives in New York City. The name of this book is derived from Cyd's childhood friend, her doll Gingerbread. Although it looks like things might heat up between Cyd and her dad's employee, who is in his twenties, this does not happen, preventing anything the least bit exciting from happening.	2004-11-16

It had a lot of detail on \\"Beast's\\" life (hence, the title), but I was disappointed to see that \\"Beauty\\" did not enter the scene until the last chapters. I expected more interaction between the two of them, and was looking more for the original fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast. Other than that, this book is filled with great imagery and detail, and I especially liked the beginning when the prince is still in Persia. It was interesting to learn a bit about their land and culture. This is a book that I might read again in a year, but it is not good enough to read over and over again like several other of Donna Jo Napoli's books. I do recommend reading this book though, it IS worth your time.	2004-11-16
US	27104640	RQO671SDWV4VW	0152046844	294223172	The Secret of Sarah Revere	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Very good for a historical fiction novel	I read this as extra credit for my english class, and I'm glad I did. It was an enjoyable, easy read while at the same time it taught me about an actual event that occurred in history. I recommend this to readers who would like to know more about this time period. It is not boring at all. However, it seemed like Sarah was miserable, and the ending was kindof...dull and unhappy. This was the first book I read by Anne Rinaldi. Since this book, I have read Hang a Thousand Trees with Ribbons and The Fifth of March by the same author. The Fifth of March is REALLY good, but I really liked Hang a Thousand Trees with Ribbons a lot as well.	2004-11-16

It is a retelling of the fairy tale Rapunzel, but it is much better. Rapunzel had always been one of my less favorite fairy tales, until I read this book. Donna Jo Napoli creates a vivid story about a mother's love and how far she will go to keep her daughter near her. This book is full of sacrifice, romance, and sadness. Napoli was genius when she wrote showing Zel's mother's point of view, which makes your heart ache for her, while normally \\"the evil witch\\" who locks Rapunzel in the tower is to be hated. Napoli also did a WONDERFUL job at depicting the gradual decline of Zel's state of mind while in the tower. Some bits are even a bit gruesome. Buy this book (it is not expensive), and you will be very happy you did because you will read it many times (I have!). After reading this book, I was very pleased because it let me have a good cry, and it left me a good feeling.	2004-11-15

I own it and I have read it at least 7 times. It is about 16-year-old Vivian, a \\"werewolf\\" who lives in a city with many other members of her \\"pack,\\" including her mother and 5 boys who are her age that she used to be friends with but now are too rowdy for her. Her father, who used to be the leader of the pack, died about a year ago when the pack was living in West Virginia, and humans found out about them and set their Inn on fire where they worked. Vivian's father was trying to save everyone left in the building, and in the process he was killed. Now the pack has no leader, and everyone is quarreling about who the new one should be. Meanwhile, at Vivian's new school (I forget where they live now that they have left West Virginia), she has no friends, but she sees a poem in the school magazine about werewolves, written by a boy named Aiden. She falls in love with Aiden, but is it safe to tell him what she really is? Vivian tries to ignore her mother Esme, who says that Vivian should only date members of the pack. Vivian must choose between her human side (chocolate) and her wolf side (blood). Sizzling with mystery and romance, this book is definitely a must-read for every teenage girl, even if you are not into fantasy.	2004-11-15

My favorite is Zel, and Sirena is also very good. Bound is a very excellent book and I am very pleased with it, especially because it was better than Beast, which i personally thought could have been a bit better.  <br />Bound is based on the Chinese version of Cinderella. I loved how it was filled with details about life in ancient China, and it was very interesting to learn more about the tradition of girls having their feet bound to make them smaller. The only small complaint I have with this book is that the end seems a bit rushed, but I really loved how the whole book was filled with Xing Xing's daily life. I especially was fascinated with Xing Xing's crazy stepmother. The book IS expensive, but i suggest you buy it!	2004-11-15

Then her mother is killed and Gemma goes to a boarding school in England. The first half of the book is better than the second, which is my biggest complaint about the book. A boy from India travels to London and it seems as if there would a good amount of romance, and it dissapointed me when there was not as much as I expected. Also, the second half becomes somewhat darker. I don't want to give anything away, so I wont say what i mean by that, but you'll know what I mean once you read it. On the plus side, it is a good thick book with a lot of detail, and the ending is pretty surprising. I suggest checking this out from the library or maybe buying it if you have the money for it.    The sequel to this book will be coming out soon, called Rebel Angels. I have a feeling that it will be even better than the first book!	2004-11-15

It is now one of my favorite books EVER. The Raging Quiet is about a girl named Marnie who is forced to marry Lord Isake in order to save her family from being kicked out of their house. After only several days of living with her new husband in a small cottage in Torcurra, where they are strangers, Isake is killed when he falls off the roof of the cottage when he tries to thatch it. This is when Marnie befriends the town's preacher and the deaf young man who the townsfolk call Raver. They think he is possessed, but Marnie realizes that he is deaf and developes a sign language the two of them can use to communicate with each other. Marnie and Raven, as she renames him, form a close bond, and Raven slowly transforms into a well-mannered young man, but there are also consequences for Marnie's actions: the townspeople begin to turn against her, which is where this book gets especially interesting and suspenseful. At some points, I could hardly sit still while reading this book. The Raging Quiet is filled with very vivid detail and touching moments. It has romance, suspense, and sadness, making it a very good read that is hard to put down. I strongly recommend buying this book, because once you read this book, you will want to read it over and over again, as I have.	2004-11-15

I have read several other of Atwater-Rhodes books, but this is by far WAY better than the others. It is filled with romance, a lot of details about the two main character's daily lives, and even a bit of politics, which I am not usually interested in, but it was worked into the story well. I especially love the details. It's like you are right there with them in their world.    Danica, the soon-to-be queen of the avian sahpeshifters (hawks), and Zane, soon-to-be king of his people, the deadly serpents, both agree that the war that has been raging between the two nations for hundreds of years needs to be put to a stop. But how? When a mediator for the two royal families suggest that Danica and Zane marry to create peace, both sides find this outrageous. Then, the two young shapeshifters realize that this is their only option. They realize the task will not be an easy one--to convince both peoples that the two rulers are in love, and trust each other, when in reality, Danica is scared silly of Zane and his deadly serpent eyes and passionate nature. Will Zane and Danica pull this off? Find out by buying this book and reading it--trust me, you'll want to buy it, so you can read it over and over...	2004-11-15

It has no substance to it, and the whole theme of the book is sex. There is no substance, and no climax. All that happens is she goes to Greece with her friends instead of a trip with her jerk of a boyfriend, then they break up, then he comes to Greece and they get back together again. How can people think that is interesting? The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because I thought the description of the house and the country sounded like it would be a neat place to go. I totally wasted my money buying this book, and I'm sure the Spanish Holiday book is just as bad.	2004-11-15

Although it is something that I might be asked to read in an English class, this is my favorite book ever and I have read it many times. Nice and thick and full of details, it paints a colorful image of life in England during that time period.<br /><br />This book shows the struggles of poor, unwanted Jane, first in the Lowood charity school, then in her search to find a family that will hire her as a governess.
