Rowling is a darn good writer, able to capture the essence of her characters in just a few paragraphs.  This is not written like a children's book.  Really liked the way she presented the Hogwarts school for witches and wizards.  Treats it like a typical boarding school, except with magic all around.  Liked the chemistry she developed between Harry, Ron and Hermoine.  Three completely different personalities that are able to team up and survive one adventure after another.  Also liked how not all the kids were buddy-buddy with one another (like real kids sometimes are).  Hermoine, in fact, is an annoying knowitall who Harry and Ron can't stand many times.  And Malfoy is just a young blaggard in practice.  Interesting and diverse personalities for the faculty, and Harry's big friend, Hagrid, is a riot.  Rowling did a first rate job taking Harry from his hellish life with his aunt and uncle and putting him into a magical environment where everything is new to him.  Lots of peaks and valleys for Harry at Hogwarts.  I most definately have to read more &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books!	2001-04-06

While I enjoyed &quot;Cuba,&quot; I was disappointed that these three characters I've enjoyed for years were relagated to a secondary role in the book. I thought Coonts did a good job handling the trials of the Sedano family as the power struggle after Castro's death begins (btw, I thought Castro died in &quot;Under Seige.&quot;  Did he get better or something).  Some of the best parts involved Ocho with the boat people fleeing to America.  Coonts really brought out the desperation and hopelessness of their situation.  The Secret Police Chief Vargas was a pretty nasty fellow, and I thought there was some good spy stuff with the CIA guys Chance and Carmellini.  Coonts did put together some solid combat scenes toward the end when Grafton led his carrier battle group against Cuba's biological ballistic missiles aimed at the Southern United States.  Loved the parts involving Cuba's lone flyable MiG-29.<br />All in all, a good book, but not up there with classic Grafton stories like &quot;Under Seige&quot; &amp; &quot;The Red Horseman.&quot;	2001-03-25

A search for the ship's lost treasure takes the diver/adventurer from a Caribbean hurricane to a secret Russian base to a plot to assassinate Castro.  Thrown into the mix is a secret base on the moon built by a clandestine group of government and business people that the Soviets are about to attack.<br />A pretty good Pitt adventure.  Lots of impossible escapes for Dirk.  Jessie LeBaron made a good female interest for Pitt.  She starts off as your typical stuck-up rich woman, but later shows she's not afraid to get her hands dirty and can endure a lot of suffering.  And I LOVED their first scene together where Pitt puts her in her place.  That was legend!  I was dissapointed there wasn't as much interaction between Pitt and his best friend, Al Giordino, as in most Cussler novels.  Really liked Ira Hagen, the President's man trying to get to the bottom of the moonbase conspiracy.  Comes off as an average looking guy, but has a first-rate investigative mind and a tenacious attitude.  Some good action scenes at the Russian base and with the battle on the moon, though I did question some of the technical accuracy, like people only coming away wounded when their spacesuit is ripped open.<br />All in all, a good Dirk Pitt adventure.	2001-03-10

A derelict alien ship with two sentient reptiles aboard.  While CEO Kyung Yazawa and veterinarian Diane Hanning prepare the ETs for life among humans, an unstable US President Baker tries to prevent the Corporation and the aliens from negotiating a deal involving the Sentients' technology . . . by any means necessary. Very excellent book.  No slow parts.  All the characters were well done and came off as very human in their thoughts, actions and reactions.  The first contact part was handled very well.  Loved the blending of fear, confusion and surprise, along with all the work that went into trying to communicate with the Sentient Snake, Poc Tec.  Also loved how Poc tried to fit into human society aboard the Yazawa space station, learning all the nuances of human society.  Both she and Hanning established a terrific and believable bond. Fast-paced and exciting ending.  Very cool fight in Zero G.  Would have liked to have seen more of the colony, though.  Also, not enough explanation for the stated slow down in space exploration after the 20th Century.  Another point, 80 some years into the future it seemed the U.S. had the same enemies as today (Iraq, Syria, North Korea).  Some geo-political factors should have been weighed in. Still, loved the book and look forward to the sequel.	2001-01-28

Still I thought he did a good job fleshing out the characters and evolving them as the story went along.  Very imaginative with the magics and different races and beings used.  None of the typical elves, trolls, dwarfs etc. like you'd get in other fantasy novels.  Also no one just blindingly follows the forces of &quot;The Light,&quot; some of whom behave no better than the evil forces they fight. Really liked when Jordan seperated the 3 farmboys, whose destiny it was to face The Dark One, from the rest of their party. Without their powerful warrior and female warrior/mystic to protect them, they had to rely on their own wits and skills to survive and rejoin their friends.  Some pretty good scenes in this part involving one boy (Perrin) learning how to communicate with wolves and dealing with trouble from a group of warriors/religious fanatics called The Children of the Light.  Not a whole lot of action, and what there was of it happened rather quick.  The end was strange but I liked it.	2001-01-01

Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson needed better execution.  His scenes of destruction in Manhattan and Staten Island is the only reason this books gets 2 stars and not 1.  The characters were poorly done.  The dialogue was not natural and, in some cases, unrealistic.  And I grew tired of the main characters, Rider and Amura, calling each other &quot;Dear&quot; and &quot;Darling&quot; every other line.  More inner thought was needed to truly flesh out the characters.  Also many of the scenes went overboard on the melodrama.  With better character development and a few more plot lines, this book could have been so much better.	2000-11-05

Totally loved the characters.  Drizzt is an awesome hero.  Loved the inner turmoil as he tries to remain true to his noble beliefs despite being connected to a race of evil elves.  The assassin Entreri was a great opponent.  Totally obsessed with killing Drizzt.   Very good job with Drizzt's fighting companions, who have to save him from being sacrificed by his evil sister to the spider queen. Cattie-brie is one self-assured, determined woman who's deadly with a bow.  King Bruenor was great.  Very tough, loyal dwarf.  And Pwent the battlerager ruled!!  The guy was nuts! Salvatore does an excellent job with his fight scenes.  Very vivid and action packed.  Also loved the fact the evil elf foot soldiers were all good fighters and not just cannon fodder as is usually the case with henchmen/bodyguards, etc.  Gave Drizzt &amp; company a lot of headaches and a lot of bruises.  I like to see the good guys have a hard time in situations like this. Definately makes me want to read more in this series.	2000-10-28

There were a few I wasn't all that thrilled by, but the rest I really enjoyed. By far the the best was &quot;Billy Mitchell's Overt Act&quot; by William Sanders.  Here the pioneer in military aviation stayed in the Army and in 1941 became the CO of a bomber wing in Hawaii.  A VERY different Pacific War results.  Wonderfully told in snipets by famous people like Harry Truman, General MacArthur &amp; Walter Lord.  The runner-up is &quot;The Craft of War&quot; by Lois Tilton, where Socrates tells the tale of Sun Tzu helping the Persians in their war against Greece.  The portrayal of Samuel Clemens in &quot;Bloodstained Ground&quot; was spot on!  Sam, aka Mark Twain, is sent by his New York Herald editor to write a story on the death of President George Custer, the hero of Little Big Horn.  Great inner turmoil story in &quot;A Hard Day For Mother,&quot; where Confederate Colonel Joshua Chamberlain leads his men in the battle for Little Round Top, with his brother is leading the Union troops.  And having Admiral Horatio Nelson command the French fleet in &quot;Vive L'Amiral&quot; was just so cool!  &quot;The Last Crusader&quot; was an OK story, but I just loved the concept of CARDINAL Napolean Bounaparte leading his troops in the Crusades. This is a definate winner for history buffs.	2000-10-21

In this one she gets involved in a search for her missing cheapskate uncle.  But the road has more detours than Route One during construction.  She runs into an embezzlement scam, a midget bail jumper and a psycho ex-boxer. Enjoyable book.  I though the last one, &quot;Four to Score&quot; was better and funnier, but still I can't complain too much about &quot;High Five.&quot;  Some really great scenes with Steph taking down the little bail jumper and with her Grandma Mazur, her Dad and a stun gun.  Fell on the floor laughing.  Like the sexual tension between Steph, Ranger and Morelli.  Who to go to bed with?  Again Evanovich gave some great insights into Stephanie's fears and insecurities.  As a native of the Trenton area, the author was spot on with her descriptions of the city, its atmosphere and its people.  Take it from someone who knows.	2000-09-24

Trapped in  an ice flow, their ship destroyed, forced to live on ice flow, crossing  open seas in small boats.  For two years they lived in bitter cold and  constant dampness.  They battled starvation, thirst and illness. Every  other day the unpredictable Antarctic weather would descend upon them.   Still they battled on in an effort to reach civilization.. Undoubtedly one  of the most amazing non-fiction stories I ever read.  The writing draws you  in, makes you experience the crews' struggles first hand.  Find out what  it's like to sail a boat through horrid weather when you are dead tired and  soaked through the bone.  When you read this, you will feel guilty about  complaining the next time you drag yourself into work fighting a cold.  A  stellar example that, even against the most impossible odds, people can  still triumph.	2000-09-10

The operation goes smoothly.  But when Cmdr. Boston Low, scientist Ludger Brink &amp; TV reporter Maggie  Robbins explore the interior, the asteroid transports them to a far away  planet of wonder and danger. Enjoyed it immensely!  Good job on the  characters.  All 3 had the personalities needed to survive on the alien  world of Cocytus.  Great interaction between rock solid,  ice-water-for-blood Low and spirited yet experienced Robbins.  Loved the  transformation in Brink.  Added a lot to the tension of the story.  Lots of  really awesome stuff to be found on the planet, especially some green  crystals that play a big, big part in the story.  The exploration and  deductive skills of the characters as they make one discovery after another  was well done and believable. The Cocytans are great aliens.  Millions of  beings of pure thought, all connected and existing in a dimension just  beyond our.  Loved their observations of the human visitors and how their  efforts, to many of them, are merely a sideshow.  Yet others root for them  and desire to help them, even though they are unable. The one complaint I  have is that I would have liked to see more fear among Low, Ludger and  Maggie of possibly being stranded on this alien world for the rest of their  lives. While they are curious, smart and confident, even the best of us  would get scared to our depths at one point or another in such a situation.  Despite that, the book was a great sci-fi tale.	2000-07-28

Douglass did a superb job keeping you guessing as to the  Chicom's real motives until the last couple chapters.  Loved the different  ways they tried to pull off the plan.  And on top of that, a super typhoon  is brewing in the Pacific. Some awesome fighter combat scenes thrown in as  well.  Great drama!  Good character development, especially among F-14  jocks Lobo and Bird Dog.  Both trying to bury some nasty ghosts in their  pasts and prove their are worthy to be top notch Tomcat drivers again.   Admiral &quot;Tombstone&quot; Magruder was his usual cool self.  There were  a few inconsistancies with some scene transitions, but overall a very  enjoyable book.	2000-07-21

When terrorists sieze a  U.S. cargo ship and slaughter its crew, the President vows not to continue  the &quot;cycle of violence&quot; and calls for no retaliation.  This  enrages the Speaker of the House, who wants hit back at the terrorist.  His  top aide, Jim Dillon, finds a section of the Constitution that would let  the Congress do just that without the President's approval. Very fast-paced  and dramatic story.  Tough to put down.  The political and legal  manovuering was very compelling.  Very easy to follow.  Good character  development.  Loved how Dillon saw his idea through to the end by going out  to the South Pacific for the climax.  The strain this whole situation puts  on his relationship with his friend Molly (who's a legal advisor to the  Prez)  was good.  Loved the dilemma the Letter of Marque and Reprisal put  the military in.  Very interesting to see how they handled it.  Drama never  stops.

Enlisting the help of a hush-hush German counter-terrorist team, both groups go up against ultranationalist  businessman Lothar Beck, who wants to create his own Reich. The book read  like a personal memoir than your typical action-adventure book.  All told  from Marchinko's POV.  Some peaks and valleys in the story.  I did enjoy  the insider information on SEAL missions and Marchinko's rather  nitty-gritty thoughts on the current state of the U.S. military and the  people in the White House.  Very, VERY *ahem* colorful expressions used.   Very good drama when the ol' Rogue &amp; co. infiltrate  Beck's HQ.  The  final assault on the Beck castle was great!  Especially the big, bloody  brawl between Marchinko &amp; a former GSG-9 commando turned Beck stooge.   One problem I had was sometimes Marchinko's reflections interrupted the  flow of some of the action scenes.  Still, overall, a pretty decent book.	2000-06-25

Aliens invading Earth during WWII.  Great concept!  Now it's 20 years later with Earth (or Tosev 3) divided under Race and human rule.  On top of that, the alien colonization  fleet arrives. Not as much action as in the first book, but Turtledove does  a great job showing how humans and aliens are trying to co-exist, and how  each one is influencing the other.  Ginger, which is like cocaine to the  Race, plays a very big part in the story, especially with the newly arrived  female aliens. Very good job showing the friction between aliens of the  conquest fleet, who've seen the horrors of war and dealth with humans for  20 years, and the colonists, who have no understanding of humans and view  their soldiers as failures.  And kudos to Turtledove for not making the  Race your typical, malevolent alien conquerers.  In the Race-ruled  countries, humans pretty much go about their business and the aliens are  even educating them (though this is to make them better citizens of the  Empire). Excellent character development.  Plenty of old and new faces,  including historical ones.  Love watching men like V. Molotov, Earl Warren,  General Le May and Adolf Eichman deal with an Earth full of reptilian  invaders.  Lots of suspense revolving around the destruction of some  colonization ships and the U.S. space station.  Looking forward to the next  book.	2000-06-15

Shadows start popping up.  Shadows he shots at.  Shadows that try to steal  his vehicle.  What should be a routine murder case turns into something  beyond all his prior experience.  Throw in an old love, a mysterious women  and superiors questioning his sanity and it doesn't get any easier for  Cellars. Tension is the word of the day for this book.  Twists come at you  left and right.  Goddard did a good job pacing them and making sure they  didn't confuse the reader.  You could feel the fear Colin Cellars was going  through at some of those scenes where he was completely alone, and  something always seemed to be lurking in the periphery.  Some funny bits,  too.  The part with loudmouth Captain Hawkins, a cigar and an OSP vehicle  sent me rolling with laughter.  Also the Captain's mummy-like appearence in  the crime lab was another classic.   Characters were fine.  Pretty down to  earth.  The personal issues that needed resolving also added to the flavor  of the story. In all, I had trouble putting this book down.	2000-05-28

What  happens at the Atlanta airport when everything goes to crud with Air Force  One coming in is crush the armrest dramatic.  Cord Macklin is the kind of  President this country needs!

Really works because it deals with two guys who are not experienced hikers.  The writing is down to earth and loaded with wise crack observations.  Bryson's companion, Katz,  rules!  If there is one man who shouldn't be hiking the AT, it's him.  All  along the way the two encounter all sorts of bizzare, interesting and  friendly people.  Mary Ellen was the best! Perhaps THE MOST ANNOYING WOMAN  ON THE PLANET!   The scenes with her were a riot! Bryson's observations on  the Trail, its flora and fauna, its history, its future are done  wonderfully. He does a good job of putting you on the AT, going through  blizzards and heatwaves, sleeping in rickety wooden shelters buried in the  woods and walking through little unheard of towns along the Trail.  The  book drags for a bit about 3/4 of the way through when Bryson hits  Pennsylvania.  Probably because PA is the worst part of the Trail.  But his  exploits there end with a hysterical scene where he's dealing with a  security guard who thinks his badge gives him the right to act like Idi  Amin. Want to know all about the AT?

Coonts proves he can write beyond Jake Grafton (no offense to the heroic admiral).   With Japan on the verge of economic disaster, a cadre of right-wing militants murder the pacifist Emporer and sieze power.  Then they go after the oil fields in Siberia.  With the  Russian military falling apart, Japanese success seems assured. Enter  Colonel Bob Cassidy and a volunteer group of F-22 pilots who go over to  give the Russians a hand. Coonts did a stupendous job with the action.  The  dogfights between the new Zeros and the F-22s ruled!  But by far the best  scene, action-wise, was the Russian sub's devestating raid on Tokyo Bay.   Unbelievable stuff!  Some of Coonts' best scenes take place on the sub.   You can feel the stress and the fear of the men aboard as they undertake  suicide missions against the best the Japanese Navy has to offer.  Death is  just one ping away for these guys. All the American pilots had very unique  personalities and my one complaint is that Coonts should have featured them  a little more.  I also would have liked to have seen more interaction  between them.  But overall, can't fault this book.  Definately a winner!	2000-03-16

Some good action, especially with the chase on Orion Lake and the battle between a suped up intelligence gathering ship and a  Chinese frigate.  As usual, Dirk Pitt is Mr. TCOB, Inc.  But I thought the  characters could have been handled a little better.  I also did not hate  the main villian, Qin Shang, like I did many other Cussler villians.  Plus,  Shang lacked a prevalent cadre of henchmen.  There didn't seem a real sense  of how evil these guys were.  Still, an enjoyable read and a very  interesting plan for the Mighty Miss.  Again, Mr. Cussler gets an  &quot;A&quot; for imagination.	2000-03-05

The opening part with a worldwide anarchist revolution blowing away world leaders is just an appetizer.  When the revolution peters out and the Russian government is no  more, the Chinese pour into Siberia.  All that is there to oppose them is  Gen. Nate Clark and his small NATO force. The characters are well done and  believable.  Harry's best scenes are in the trenches, capturing the full  range of emotions of the common infantryman.  The battles are incredibly  done.  The siege at the Siberian air base is masterful.  I loved his  portrayal of the anarchist &quot;leader&quot; Kartsev.  Does not come of as  the evil man he really is but as a social scientist conducting a grand  experiment.  Unfortunately lots and lots and lots of people are dying in  the process.  The ending could have been a little more dramatic, but  overall bully for Eric L. Harry!	2000-02-20

And it works!  Reviving Colonel Thorn and Agent Gray from &quot;The Enemy Within,&quot; Bond puts them on the trail of a  Saudi prince with a grand scheme to cripple the U.S.  Circumstances force  Them to operate outside the law to thwart the operation. An excellent job  showing the dangers of operating rogue.  Loved some of the moral and legal  dilemmas Thorn and Gray had to face.  The bad guys are smart and  sophisticated, covering their tracks masterfully and taxing all of Thorn  and Gray's abilities to the limit.  Not as many action scenes as in  previous Bond novels, but the drama and intigue do hold you.  The final  battle is awesome!  Great supporting characters as well, from Thorn's old  C.O. General Farrell to slimey FBI Assistant Director McDowell, who's got  his own agenda and a hatred toward Agent Gary.  Great story!  A real  winner!	2000-01-15

However, Douglass could have handled it better.  Also, better editing was needed.  I noticed too many errors and inaccuracies for the standard paperback.  The  action scenes were OK.  The missions got tougher as the book went on.   Still I think the SEALS should have encountered a tad more difficulties.   Did not get a real enough sense of the danger they were in.  Plus character  development was really lacking.  The book was basically a series of  missions the SEAL Team went on in Korea.  It would have been better to have  one central plot with a few other little missions thrown in on the side.   Concentrating a three or four of the SEAL characters would have helped.   All in all, this book had the markings that it was rushed  into  publication.	2000-01-03

A Soviet sleeper agent rises through the ranks to command an LA-class attack sub.  Then he uses it to sink US ballistic missile subs and neutralize American strategic power in  the Pacific.  Charles D. Taylor did a great job bringing the characters to  life.  Little by little he builds the tension, showing how the rest of the  men under sleeper Wayne Newell's command react when they think they are at  war.  The stress, the pressure all start to wear at their psyche.  Doubt  creeps in, eventually the crew begins to question its captain.  The strain  of the mission pulls you in.  Add to it the Naval commanders trying to  figure out what's happening in the Pacific.  The final, 3-way sub battle is  a rush!  You can't put the book down until you reach the end.	1999-12-24
