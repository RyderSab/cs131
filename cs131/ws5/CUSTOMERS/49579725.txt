Otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I've read all of Mr. Dickey novels but this one was insulting to me being a black woman and a supporter of black writers. Personally I'm not for interracial relationships but why was all the black women so ghetto. The characters were not real. I did not like this book.	2001-03-11
