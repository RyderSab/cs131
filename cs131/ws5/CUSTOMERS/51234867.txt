When the author talks about designing with plants, she is primarily talking about bushes, trees, etc. -- flowers are somewhat shortchanged. The book is gorgeous, though, and well worth looking into.	2002-02-22

She points out that the women behind those veils are not just submissive faceless people but just like us -- some highly educated and intelligent, some highly maternal, etc. I highly recommend the book. However, her insights into the Muslim world are based on getting to know a few people; it doesn't truly contain a deep grasp of the political and social issues, and I don't think she makes any claims that it does.  This is just one book out of many that can help us understand Middle Eastern cultures.<br />I did find it disappointing that she shared so little into her relationship with the Middle Eastern man she married; if she wanted to help others understand crossing over cultural borders, that facet of her life, alone, may have been more invaluable than talking about the other people that she got to know on a much more superficial level.	2001-10-22

The author has included many good points in her book, as other reviewers have commented on. I do want to warn the potential buyer that this is not a quick or easy read. She writes about many difficult concepts relating to forgiveness which take some real time to think over.<br />Also, I feel that the title and subtitle of this book really don't fit it's contents. The author spends a great deal of space in the book writing about theological, biblical and somewhat ethereal issues dealing with forgiveness and the roles of men and women in marriage; but there was much less practical, hands-on, day-to-day, &quot;real family life&quot; living advice than I expected.  <br />One part of this book that I greatly appreciated was it's emphasis on the need for we &quot;evangelical&quot; or &quot;fundamentalist&quot; Christians to stop playing a role, a part that we think we should fit into, and rather focus on the true internal character of our hearts. She also differentiates between falsely judging someone (that is God's job, alone) and serving as someone who helps someone else overcome their sin. She points out that, since our churches suffer from as much overt decay as our society (as seen in our divorce rates and porn-use rates), we need to realize that there is something drastically wrong in our church society.<br /> I recommend this book for anyone who has the time to devote to this deep subject of forgiveness. I highly recommend this author's first book, An Affair of the Mind.	2001-06-06

But the fact is that I don't want my son growing up thinking it's &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; to pull pranks on other people like the main characters in this book do; I also want him to understand that people such as principals do need to be shown basic respect, even if one doesn't particularly like them. So because of that I'm not going to get other books in this series. There are tons of other chapter books that are funny and can encourage my son to love reading.<br />On the positive side, it's fabulous that the two main characters in this book are very creative, making their own comic books (which will encourage creativity in kids who read these books); and, one friend is black and one is white. Because this inter-racial friendship is presented without ever making an issue of it I think it is a positive friendship model for children.	2001-05-21

I have to agree with other critics, though, that his push of soy products gets old. Soy products are expensive, not available everywhere, and some people (not me, but my husband) just hate them. Yet Dr. Shapiro gives almost no other protein options. He also uses low-sugar products, many of which have artificial sweeteners that many people would argue are more unhealthy than sugar. Also, he uses some super-size foods for basic comparisons...he uses an oversized 400 calorie bagel as an example, yet the bagels my family buys prepackaged from the store have only 180 calories. My point is this: Dr. Shapiro's book will get you out of your comfort zone and make you re-evaluate what you eat, which is fabulous So use that same principle when using his book. You can still have a turkey sandwich if you use less meat than his photos, and no-fat mayo -- you don't have to use expensive soy lunch products. I also found it disappoining that he included photos of specialized dishes, but then didn't provide recipes. All this aside, I have lost weight because I am incorporating much from his book into my eating choices.	2001-03-15

The girl is disappointed in the gift, and eventually tosses it outside, never thinking of it again. But she wakes up one morning to find that it has bloomed despite her neglect. She also learns her father is the one who secretly gave her the gift, and she apologizes for ignoring his gift. &quot;Will you forgive me&quot; she askes. He replies, &quot;Oh, my child, That's what Easter is all about.&quot;  Bible verses in small print at the bottom of the pages tie the story to the Bible (when the girl receives the gift she is disappointed, as it appears to be just dirt -- the corresponding verse is &quot;There was nothing in his appearance to make us desire him; when the girl tosses the bulb out, the verse is Isaiah 53:3: He was hated and rejected by people...People would not even look at him.&quot;) The Bible verses are in a child-friendly translation, which is wonderful.

The artwork is quircky (the characters are peculiar-looking little things!) but kid-friendly.<br />Of course this book is a good gift for Christian kids, but I think it makes an even better gift for non-Christian kids whose parents might not otherwise be thrilled about having their kids read a &quot;Christian&quot; book. Ultimately children will learn from it the Christian concept of God as our father and maker, and the fact that each of us are special to God  -- even though &quot;God&quot; isn't referred to in the story. It's a good way to get the message across, without causing undue offense to family or friends who don't want overtly Christian books given to their children.	2001-01-08

However, he gets tired and ends up falling asleep under a tree. When the forest animals gather 'round him and he tells them he might be too tired to deliver the presents this year, an alarmed fox asks, &quot;Does that mean there won't be a Christmas anymore?&quot;  Santa replies, &quot;No, no no...Christmas hasn't got anything to do with me.&quot; And he tells them his favorite story -- about the first Christmas, when Jesus the Son of God was born.  He concludes, &quot;Love was the gift God gave to us on the first Christmas, and it still is, you know. And this love is far better than any presents I can ever deliver.&quot; Re-energized by his remembering of the story, he and the animals return to his house to prepare for Christmas and deliver the presents. <br />This is an equally fun and meaningful story.

This is a good, easy-to-read description of the Pilgrim's journey to America, their hard winter, and the first &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; celebration. However, I think it whitewashes history a little too much. It virtually ignores the tension that existed between the Pilgrims and Indians. There needs to be a happy median struck between telling the truly wonderful aspects of that first Thanksgiving -- how the two peoples were able to come together, if only for a short time, to share the celebration -- while acknowledging there were difficulties in the relationship between Pilgrims amd Indians. This isn't being &quot;politically correct&quot; -- it's just acknowledging the truth to our children that relationships between those two groups of peoples were not usually easy. Life is complex, even for young children -- they will understand and appreciate being told the full story.	2000-10-19

The boy is inspired by the story and decides to share with others, like St. Nick did. The book ends with a cheerful picture of Santa: &quot;As the family sat around and talked half the night, Todd thought he saw, in the snow and moonlight...a bright-eyed Saint Nicholas with his sack looking in, and wide across his face, a jolly old grin.&quot; Children will know that the real Santa is now in heaven, but people still rememeber him today because of his generous spirit.

Everyone is embarrased that she asks, as the adults all know her family can't afford the tree. The farmer's wife responds that she is sorry, the tree isn't for sale...because they'd like the girl's family to have it as a gift. The book ends, &quot;Yes, it was a great sacrifice.

At first I was in denial but it's time to face facts: I've succumbed to variegated madness.&quot;  On vines: &quot;Some gardeners look upon vines with distrust; perhaps their twining, creeping, twisting ways unleash something subconscious, something Freudian.&quot;   On advice: &quot;There's not much point in saying 'Holy cow, that Artemisia 'Valerie Finnis' has choked out half your herb garden,' when the gardener is painfully aware of the problem.

Most of the children I know actually  have too much stuff --clothes, toys, etc. -- so I think it is important for  them to hear and read this story. Children from any background -- affluent  or poor -- need to know that it isn't what they own that is important, but  how they feel about themselves inside, and how much they are loved.  This  book shows a family that is strong, loving, and good, despite the hardships  of poverty. The illustrations are wonderful and eye-catching for children.  I can't say enough good things about this book.	2000-08-14

This is just fiction...&quot;. The &quot;fuss&quot;  and criticism over these books is  because there is no getting around the fact that they are poorly written  series. The &quot;fuss&quot; is because the very fact that these books are  selling so well confirms what many people think of  Christians -- that we  are often a non-thinking people who buy and believe anything that has a  Christian label. The &quot;fuss&quot; is because Christ calls us to higher  standards in everything we do (and write, and read) than non-Christians,  not lower standards.The &quot;fuss&quot; is because it is seems painfully  clear to me that the authors and publisher have sold out to the idea of  making money rather than writing and selling quality fiction. When Jesus  was on this earth he was furious -- yes, re-read the passage, **furious**  -- at those who were selling trinkets in the holy temple. So many  wonderful, inspiring and thought provoking Christian books are gathering  dust in Amazon's warehouse...do your spiritual life a favor and spend your  money on some of those books instead of the &quot;Left Behind&quot;  trinkets!	2000-08-08

The combination of an ancient yet still intriguing mystery, modern archeologists discovering it, and interesting explanations of an  ancient culture grabbed my attention immediately and kept it. The contrast  of the technological and &quot;scientific&quot; world of the archeologists  with the deeply spiritual, mystical beliefs of the ancient culture was  especially interesting and thought-provoking. The ending was unexpected yet  &quot;worked&quot;.	2000-08-01

The fact that Cassie's story has been told and re-told proves that. This book is wonderfully  honest, and I admire parents who fight to keep their children from the dark  forces in our society. There are people who are proclaiming her story to be  an &quot;urban legend&quot; -- saying that she wasn't a martyr, that she  wasn't asked if she believed in God. Don't believe the lies. Those of us  from the Denver area saw the initial interviews on t.v., long before this  book was even dreamed of. I will never forget listening to the eye-witness  report of the young man who was next to her in the library who recounted  the killer's question and Cassie's reply. I will never forget another young  man saying that he felt Isaiah Schoels was killed because he was black.  I  pray that my children will have the kind of faith it takes to stand up to a  world that is increasingly full of hate and prejudice.	2000-07-24

It was  stuffed down my throat as a child, and now as an adult I feel, &quot;Wow, I've read this so many times. Can  there actually be something relevant in here for me, now?&quot; Yes, there  is, and this book helps me see that clearly. Don't be misled, though --  this isn't a &quot;version&quot; of the Bible, it is one man's paraphrase.  Serious, scholarly research couldn't, of course, be done with this book.  But how many of us need the scholarly research in our daily lives? Not me,  not usually. What I do need is to be reminded that God is alive and real  and right here, right now, and &quot;The Message&quot; does that for me.  <br />I will point out that this is a very &quot;Americanized&quot;  book, and  that is unfortunate because it is limited only to an American audience.  People in other countries, even those who speak good English, would have  difficulty with so many idioms. But putting that aside, this book has  helped me feel God's reality in my life once again.	2000-07-24

Elizabeth's &quot;romantic&quot; relationship as a young woman was dismal and depressing, and her marriage wasn't much better;  Aisling turned to the same type of  dismal, loveless relationship as an  &quot;older&quot; woman. This book is promoted as a story about friendship,  but what kind of friends enable each other to stay in such hideous  relationships without ever encouraging each other to get out and move on to  better things?  Also, the sudden change in Aisling's husband after they got  married was puzzling and unrealistic. I didn't think this book was worth  the time or money.	2000-07-24

Also, it seems to me that this type of  book would be written primarily for those of us who aren't naturally adept in English  usage -- if that is the case, I think the author should remember the KISS  rule (Keep it simple, stupid) and avoid sentences like this one in chapter  13:  &quot;A false comparison is one wherein a comparative or a superlative  degree construction is used without a clearly stated basis for the  comparison...&quot; .

Yet, on the strong recommendation of a friend, I read this book and loved it deeply. It deals with some of the deepest issues in our relationships -- will this  person stick around?  will this person still love me once they find out  what I&quot;m *really* like. On one level this is a romance between a man  and a woman; on the other it is a brave re-telling of a biblical story that  makes many Christians squirm -- God telling Hosea to marry a prostitute. I  recommend this book to everyone now, even non-romance readers such as  myself.	2000-07-13

This book will help bring healing to many people, especially if they are conservative/evangelical Christians who want to deal with the impact of sexual abuse in their lives.   However, the author is, in many places,  simply hard to understand. Clarity and a simpler writing style would serve  his readers better. <br />Also, I would not recommend this book to  non-Christians or liberal Christians. If you fit either of those categories  and are seeking healing from abuse, then turning to God is still your  answer for healing -- but this book might not be the one to help you do  that.	2000-07-03

Books	5	18	19	N	N	God loves you, even in the middle of your pain	My first husband dealt with chronic pain before he died at a young age. He himself had come to true peace with God and the path of pain he had to travel, but it made me question God. If *I* loved my husband so much that I  would have taken his pain on myself, then why didn't God?   Why didn't God  just heal him and so many others like him. This is the best book I've ever  found to address the issue of pain from a Christian perspective. There are  no easy answers, but I think we are meant to walk in faith in God's  goodness and love for us until we are face-to-face with God and have those  answers. Someone once asked my husband if he would ask God why he'd endured  so many years of pain in his lifetime, and he said, &quot;Are you kidding?  I'm going to be so happy to be with God I don't think I'll even think of  asking that!&quot; My husband believed in God's deep, abiding, eternal and  intensely personal love. I believe this book will help you understand that  part of God even better than you already do.	2000-05-05

Perhaps the most important thing I've learned is that  newer research shows that many thyroid patients feel better with a medicine  that contains two types of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3). Currently many of  us are still on pills like levothyroxine or Synthroid, which only have one  type of hormone. Although I haven't yet convinced my HMO doctor to change  my medicine from the traditional Synthroid, she did increase my dose and I  already feel better. This gives me hope that I can feel even *better* on a  medicine with both T4 and T3.	2000-03-29

What truly makes this book captivating, though, is the outstanding and gorgeous  artwork. The only thing I found disappointing is the inclusion of a  &quot;Christian-ese&quot; term which will be confusing to children not from  specifically evangelical families (at one point in the story the main  character, a young boy,  and his family sit down for &quot;daily  devotions&quot; -- a term and concept which is not commonly used and/or  practiced in all Christian households).  Despite that minor disappointment,  I strongly recommend this book for *anyone* who wants to explain the  spiritual aspects of Easter to children.	2000-03-20

Ten years ago my HMO doctor said I was a &quot;little&quot; hypothyroid, handed me a pill (levothyroxine) and said I'd be back to normal in six weeks. What an incredibly uninformed statement that turned out to be! Is &quot;normal&quot; being freezing cold when others are hot? Is  &quot;normal&quot; going to bed at 8 PM every night from sheer exhaustion?  I refuse to believe that is &quot;normal&quot;! This book recommends  finding a doctor (probably holistic) who will listen to you and consider  using alternative treatments until you are symptom-free and truly  &quot;normal&quot; again. It gives *many* other practical suggestions, such  as not taking iron or calcium supplements at the same time as your thyroid  medicine. And perhaps most of all it is validating -- it is tremendously  wonderful to know that I am not alone in wondering why that magic little  levothyroxine pill doesn't   live up to its promise; that I'm not the only  thyroid patient who was given no information about the disease; and that  I'm not the only thyroid patient whose doctor blames her ongoing symptoms  to &quot;stress&quot; or some other enigmatic cause. And, oddly enough, it  may have given me an explanation to why my mother has lost the outer half  of her eyebrows -- that is a complaint of many undiagnosed thyroid  patients!  From now on I am not going to let my doctor blow me off. If  necessary, I am going to go outside my HMO and find a doctor who is willing  to listen to my complaints and work with me to see if I can feel alive once  again.	2000-03-14

While it is wonderful that the author talks about a common and socially acceptable sin -- gluttony -- I do have some cautions about this book. First, be cautious whenever anyone writes as if their ideas are  &quot;God's&quot; ideas. For instance, the author purports that eating one  bite beyond full is a sin and requires an immediate prayer for forgiveness.  Does the Bible support that idea? Yes, the Bible states that gluttony is a  sin...but does the definition of gluttony include &quot;one bite beyond  full&quot;? The book also loads guilt and feelings of condemnation on its  readers, while the Bible clearly states that Christians are forgiven of  sins because of Jesus and we are not condemned (Romans 8:1). I suggest that  you ask God to help you incorporate all the truths that are in this book  but leave behind anything not from Him.	2000-03-06
