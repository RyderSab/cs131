He is Dickeson McCunn, newly retired gorcery shop owner, whose life has been very 'respectable.'  Now, free from his business (and his wife being away from home), Dickson leaves the city to spend time walking in the countryside of Scotland.   <br /> <br />But while visiting the village called Dalquharter, Dickson meets a young English poet Mr. Heritage, who tries to convince him that in the ruined mansion Huntingtower, a young woman is held against her will, and the poet claims that he knows her personally.  Moreover, Heritage believes that the woman is a Russian princess.  Unconvinced, Dickson refuses to take part in his 'rescue' plans ... at first. <br /> <br />The plot is vintage Buchan, with lots of actions (exciting and  incredible ones), plus well-observed descritions of characters.  Dickson is not as active or heroic as Richard Hannay, but the situation is similar to that of 'The Thirty-Nine Steps.'  The difference is inclusion of historical references to the post-revolution Russia, and 'the Gorbals Die-Hards,' group of local kids who assist the jobs of Dickson.  The colorful Scottish background is also attarctive. <br /> <br />The book is a thriller, but unlike 'Greenmantle,' it is not political.  It's more like reading Scott or Stevenson, with sly and often comical commentary to the contemporary social situations here and there, such as deft description of one boy who recounts his experience joining in sociliast's meeting, thinking that it's a football club.  And of course, Russian princess reminds us of the legend of Anastasia. <br /> <br />The book fails to be convincing when it tries to show the 'villains' who are only stock characters, and the idea of putting a respectable middle-class Glassgow grocery store owner does not work in the latter half of the book, in which Dickson McCunn is less interesting presence than the 'Die-Hards.' And you probably don't like the book's occasional derogatory commentary on certain group (especially Jewish people).  Some of the values here are those of the 1920s, and they are clearly dated. <br /> <br />But the actions and the characters (if not all) are still good, and the narrator draws vivid sketches of people with clever and pithy wording.  The catalogue of people Dickson meets on the road (including Heritage) is all lively, and the entire mood of the book is surprisingly optimistic.  The book is readable and entertaining in a different way than Buchan's spy novels.	2005-09-08

Sweet convincingly presents the vivid portrait of the people who loved fun and thrills as we do now.  His scope is a little wider than it should be, but his book provides fascinating views on the Victorian world. <br /> <br />See the following examples.  Many believe today that the Victorians were so prudish that they covered the legs of a piano with clothe.  Matthew Sweet, showing a contemporary illustration of a piano with uncovered legs, gives us a more reasonable explanation about the popular myth of the covered piano legs.  In other places of his book, Sweet shows substantial amount of evidences about the Victorian's attitudes about sex, which are ironically more liberated than those of the Bloomsbury set who ridiculed the preceding generations. <br /> <br />Many popular ideas about the 19th century England are challenged -- like our ideas about thier male-dominated family -- and Matthew Sweet successfully debunks them.  Not that the book is preachy or didactic.  Far from it.  The book is always readable and never fails to be interesting with the intriguing historical anecdotes about the first junk mail (coming from a dentist), ancestors of modern cinema, craze about celebrity, and sensationalism of tabroids, all of which we inherited from the Victorians. <br /> <br />For all the readable sentences and the notes the book provides, you may not like some parts of 'Inventing the Victorains.'  I'm not talking about the content, but the style of composing the book.  Each chapter begins with modern topics as introductory part in a bit far-fetched way.  To tell the Victorians' fascination about the visual arts, Matthew Sweet begins with his own episodes about the 2000 Cannes Film Festival where he witnessed some new techiniques.  Even Monica Lewinsky's promotional tour in England (where the author met her at a bookshop) is used to introduce one chapter.  Do we need that, even if he made a point putting these two things -- old and new -- side by side?  It depends. <br /> <br />And the topics dealt here are many, too many, you might say.  Many names appear fleetingly, but in many cases I am afraid you (and I) never heard of them before.  To describe the cinematic innovation, he writes \\"cinemascope, 3-D, Smell-o-Vision, 'Emergo' ... and 'Percepto'\\" before citing the name of 'The Blair Witch Project' and Marchant/Ivory films.  And they are all in one chapter.  If you don't know director William Castle and his films, you don't know what the 'Emergo' vision is like.  Well, just a quibble. <br /> <br />Fortunately, however, you just can just skip over these minor things.  Actually, most part of the book is both erudite and entertaining, feat few people can achieve.  Episodes quoted here are often about interior decoration, cooking, sex scandals, media circus, porno, and even serial killers, topics we all are familiar to.  Recommended to anyone who is interested in this era.	2005-08-24

Greene contains the following 13 short stories: <br /> <br />The Murders in the Rue Morgue by Edgar Allan Poe <br />Three \\"Detective\\" Anecdites by Charles Dickens <br />The Biter Bit by Wilkie Collins <br />A Singular Abduction by Rodrigues Ottolengui <br />The Leopaard Man's Story by Jack London <br />The Phantom Motor by Jacques Futrelle <br />The Million-Dollar Dog by Samuel Hopkins Adams <br />The Bag of Sand by Baroness Orczy <br />The Denton Boudoir Mystery by Gelett Burgess <br />Naboth's Vineyard by Melville Davisson Post <br />A Jury of Her Peers by Susan Glaspell <br />The Ordinary Hairpins by E. C. Bentley <br />The Archduke's Tea by H. C. Bailey <br /> <br />One of the characteristics of the collection is its way of selecting the pieces.  The book's selection, it is suggested, is compiled on the strength of the sleuths they depict.  The result is a curious mixture of well-known classic stories and very obscure tales.        <br /> <br />The book begins with Poe's classic, one of the most famous detective stories in the world.  Then, comes Dickens' journalistic work (published in his own magazine) about the accounts told by the three police detectives who recounts their strange experiences during their jobs.  Next comes Collins' comic short (written in his trademark epistle style). <br /> <br />I don't intend to give too mcuh information here, but let me say a little bit more.  Post's story features Uncle Abner (very American) while Bailey's Reggie Fortune (very English).  The contrast of their method of 'solution' is interesting, but you might have already read either, or both of them.  Orczy's is about a lady detective (and narrated by anoher female), but fails to fully capitalize on the gender role.  Maybe she will be remembered better as the creator of 'The Man in the Corner.'  Bentley's tale here is about sleuth/painter Philip Trent.  But of course, Trent was once unwittingly involved in half-jokingly titled 'Trent's Last Case' which is actually Trent's  first, and best case.       <br /> <br />As I explained so far, though I do not question the qualities of the tales themselves, this book has a very inconsistent tone.  On the one hand you have Susan Glaspell's story, which sounds more like a feminism writer's drama (maybe it is), in which a murder per se is not the real concern of some characters (and the author).  On the other, you get Jacque Futrelle's superhuman The Thinking Machine, who solves a 100 % pure puzzle (Do you believe in the story of a car that virtually vanishes like that???).   <br /> <br />Though I enjoyed reading this book, I kept thinking -- Who are the target readers of the book?  So I suggest that you read the content of the book above before buying.  Several of the tales here are easily available elsewhere, or probably you have already read them.  And the book has no notes, and the biographical commentary about each writer is adequate but  thin.	2005-08-19

Originally published in 1977, Hugh Lamb's collection, this time published by Dover, has many now obscure late Victorian ghost stories, and contains the following works: <br /> <br />The Devil of the Marsh by H. B. Marriott-Watson <br />A Tragic Honeymoon by G. R. Sims <br />The Battle of the Monsters by Morgan Robertson <br />The Return by R. Murrey Gilchrist <br />The Corpse Light by Dick Donovan <br />The Ship That Saw a Ghost by Frank Norris <br />A Bottomless Grave by Ambrose Bierce <br />One Summer Night by Ambrose Bierce <br />Ghosts That Have Haunted Me by J. K. Bangs <br />Haunted by Spirits by George Mandeville Fenn <br />A Ghost Slayer by J. Keightley Snowdon <br />The Tomb by Guy de Maupassant <br />The Man with the Nose by Rhoda Broughton <br />My Nightmare by Dorothea Gerard <br />A Life-watch by Georgina C. Clark <br />The Haunted Chair by Richard Marsh <br />Coolies by W. Carlton Dawe <br />The Three Souls by Erckmann-Chatrian <br />A Strange Goldfield by Guy Boothby <br />An Alpine Divorce by Robert Barr <br />The Story of Baelbrow by E. and H. Heron  <br /> <br />Though the book's title reads 'Tales of Terrors,' the contents are rich in variety.  Actually, you may say too rich to be credited as 'tales of terror.'  For example, read 'The Battle of the Monsters,' and you will find this curious tale rather belongs sci-fi theme (like 'Flatland').  Some are intended as parody or even comedy though I do not assure you will find them really amusing.  One unique choice is 'Collies,' a nightmarish experience of a white sailor on the sea off the coast of China, and probably you don't like the tale's tone very much when it unabashedly makes use of so-called fear of 'yellow peril.' (To do the story justice, however, this adventure story itself is well-written.) <br /> <br />Perhaps the best-known writer on the list above is Frank Norris, author of 'The Octopus' and others.  Like Jack London, he wrote tales with nautical topics, and his story here is probably the best one in this collection.  Claustrophobic and atmospheric, his tale with ghost-ship theme is very effective in blending the dream-like feelings and realistic background. <br /> <br />My other favorites is Ambrose Bierce and Rhoda Broughton.  Bierce's second story with only two pages is vintage Bierce, who mixes two popular ghost story themes -- 'buried alive' theme and 'body snatcher' theme -- and leads to a very disturbing (and nasty) ending.   <br /> <br />Broughton's tale is, on the other hand, very psychological, in which a typical English gentleman, after marrying a young girl, sees his newly-wed bride gradually drawn to 'the other side.'  The tale is intriguing for what it suggests (and that's sexual), and some readers may remember one famous novel called 'Trilby.' <br /> <br />Anyway, not every tale is good, I admit, and if you say there are better ghost stories out there, I am ready to agree with you.  But I enjoyed reading them as for what they are -- as something old-fashioned, often dated, but still interesting just because they are dated.	2005-08-12

H. Allen, London, and contains the following short stories. <br /> <br />The Haunted Station by Hume Nesbit <br />The Hour and the Man by Robert Barr <br />Nut Bush Farm by Mrs. J. H. Riddell <br />The Man Who Coined His Blood in Gold by J. H.

The collection starts with `The Haunted Station' in which an escaped convict in Australia experiences a weird thing or two in a deserted house in the middle of nowhere in Down Under, and ends with a tale about a mysterious cell in prison.  None of them might not be as scary as, say, W. W. Jacobs' anthology favorite `The Monkey's Paw', and Barr's story belongs to another genre such as `cruel tales' by some French writers, but the distinct taste of Victorian ghost stories is always there in this selection. <br /> <br />The writers are not all second-rate, as you might think.  Look carefully, and you will find some familiar names like Ambrose Bierce (his four `stories' here are actually urban legend like reports on the strange episodes that really happened.  At least, so they claim).  Richard Marsh is, and will be, known as the writer of `The Beetle' while Guy Boothby is famous for his unique creation for the arch-villain Dr. Nichola.  These biographical things are provided by the editor Hugh Lamb for those who are interested in the historical background. <br /> <br />Not all are bone-chilling stories, I must say, and some of them are rather impossible by today's standard (of medicine, read the story of stiletto for instance); some are awfully predictable, and some, though given good ideas, miss the chance to develop them.  But for those who like reading old-fashioned macabre tales, and who can ignore the obvious flaws, the collection would be a nice choice to read at night.	2005-08-05

Boyle reveals in the introduction that while working on his thesis (with the instructing professor Gordon N. Ray, known for his biography of Thackeray), Doyle stumbled upon some interesting materials -- a collection of the clippings from newspapers and journals in Victorian era, which became the inspiration of the book. <br /> <br />Doyle's contention is nothing unique -- that is, the real-life crimes and the people's reactions to them represent the far-reaching changes among the Victorian society, and the novels like Dickens, Collins, and Braddon reflect these drastic social changes.  If you remember that any recently published 'The Moonstone' have footnotes on the possible influence of the Constance Kent case, you will understand the point Boyle's book is trying to make.  So far, it is alright.  <br /> <br />However, the book itself has two great problems.  One is that the writer's argument is no longer fresh or insightful today.  The book was originally published in 1989, but by that time the movement of reassessment of the popular novels of the 19th century England have already started.  Many materials are reprinted and published since then, and it is not surprising to hear the hidden relations between the authors and the society any more. <br /> <br />The other problem is more serious.  That is, Boyle tries to cover so many areas that his arguments become very unfocused, even incoherent.  He picks up only three novels to prove his theory -- Braddon's 'Lady Audley's Secret,'  Collins' 'Armadale,' and Le Fanu's novella 'The Green Tea.'  Each discussion of his lacks freshness or insight; even they are sometimes banal.  The writer takes up several crime cases (and divorce trials) to further his theory -- including the famous William Palmer case -- but none of them is particularly interesting.  Anyone interested in the Victorian world knows something about Palmer, but the book, which treats Palmer and other cases very cursorily, does not add anything new to the knowledge.      <br /> <br />More annoying is the part in which Boyle reveals unneessary details of his research process before writing the book itself, like, about the minute descriptions about his going to such and such places, meeting such and such people.  We don't need them, especially when we are submitted to reading them in the middle of the body of the book. <br /> <br />I do not say the writer did not do thorough research.  The bibliography at the end of the book suggests his devotion to the topic, but the end results suggest differently.  The contents are thin, the arguments are commonplace, and the discussion is lukewarm.  We often find such phrases 'at any rate' or 'anyway' and with these words the writer goes on to another topic before going into deeper, more profound discussion about the topics. <br /> <br />At the back of the cover of the hardback edition, Richard D. Altick writes 'A thoughtful and provocative study, engagingly written.'  The praise should be given to Altick himself, whose books are always 'thoughtful and provocative' and 'engagingly written.'  Skip this one, and read Altick, that's my advice.	2005-05-29
US	52287429	R27DX1Y1ETKEHQ	0851170021	982689033	Victorian Underworld	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Bit Dated But Fascinating Overview of the Other Victorians	[The following review refers to the Penguin paperback edition reprinted in 1991.] <br /> <br />First published in 1970, 'The Victorian Underworld' by Kellow Chesney still remains informative in its own way, telling us about the criminal world hidden beneath the facede of Victorian prudishness, but to some readers, especially the readers who have already some knowledge about this nether world, the book is too general and looks even cursory.  Not that Kellow Chesney (about whom I know nothing) didn't homework.  It is that the book covers too many topics about which we have come to know more thanks to the scholarly efforts done after the book was originally published. <br /> <br />The book contains the following chapters: 1) The Mid-century; 2) The Borders of the underworld; 3) The wanderers; 4) Citadels of the underworld; 5) Gonophs, footpads and the swell mob; 6) Cracksman and fences; 7) Beggars; 8) Magsmen, macers and shofulmen; 9) The sporting underworld; 10) Prostitution.  The book comes with many illustrations, plus glossary of colloquial words, which is very helpful and interesting to read. <br /> <br />I said 'criminal world' but the fact is that the panorama you see here is not restricted to them.  Some works are more legitimate though ill-paid, and the term 'underworld' is used quite inclusively.  So this book re-creates the life of various kind of people -- traveling circus, child theives and fences (ala 'Oliver Twist'), religious fakes, boxers and promotors, etc.  The list goes on and on, but what is most impressive is that there are sub-divisions or minor categories in each of them.  You should not use a broad word 'prostitutes' when thinking about the night life in London for some of them are totally different type from the others.  The book shows us, for example, the merits and demerits of life in a brothel in London, or the possible fates of the (few) luckier fallen women and of the unlucky ones. <br />        <br />Though the book is a fascinating read, it has some demerits.  The bibliography is too old (for instance, today Steven Marcus's 'The Other Victorians' is indespensable when writing about prostitution in Victorian England), and sometimes Kellow Chesney quotes too long passages from other sources like Charles Dickens or Henry Mayhew, which go on more than several pages.  Now these primary sources are (or would be) available on internet or in e-texts, and this makes the book look slightly dated.   <br /> <br />Still 'The Victorian Underworld' is always readble, free from pedantic ideas about the Victorians.  Written with a compassionate heart, the author leads us to the kaleidoscopic world of the other Victorians.  It will give you a good overview of the world which Victorians like Dickens knew well, but would not fully reveal on the books.	2005-04-28
US	52287429	R1W88V7E98B9FY	B0007ESGXC	145280072	Murder for pleasure: The life and times of the detective story	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Dated, But Still Informative Book on Detective Novels	First published in 1941, then enlarged in 1951, Howard Haycraft's 'Murder for Pleasure' is one of the earliest books that took the detective novel seriouly, examining the major and minor works of the genre.  It must be said that the book looks often terribly dated in several places, and readers living in the 21st century can read excellent 'Bloody Murder' by Julian Symons or 'The Perfect Murder' by David Lehman, but still 'Murder for Pleasure' gives precious information about the genre and occasional insights. <br /> <br />From the time of Poe, Howard Haycraft traces the history of detective novel mainly in England, America, and France (the last not much).  As Haycraft covers only up until 1941, the names of the authors Haycraft mentions look often a little too selective, or too classic now.  In this book Agatha Christie is already given a due recognition, but Eric Ambler and Nicholas Blake are still newcomers, and you barely hear the works of one William Irish.   <br /> <br />Instead, you can find the titles of the books, or the names of the mystery writers that are forgotten today.  For example, Haycraft praises one detective series featuring Uncle Abner and its creator Melville Davisson Post (1871-1930), giving more than three pages to Post's works.  For today's readers, Haycraft's judgement that no one is a true connoisseuer of detective novel without reading all the Uncle Abner stories sounds very hasty. <br /> <br />But the differences of taste and writing style becomes exactly the fun of reading this book, because 'Murder for Pleasure' records many minor, now forgotten writers of the genre.  The 'quiz' section and others are interesting, but slightly look irrelevant (Who is Prof. S.F.X.Van Dusen?), the book is clearly written by the hand of a man who really loves detective novels, and his enthusiastic sentences reveal that fact. <br /> <br />Haycraft's voice is not that of scholar, but of a devoted fan of detective novels.  As if to show his origin, he generously gives tips for aspiring writers, like advice about how to negotiate the publishers (no acadamics would write like that).  And like any avid fans, he worries too much about the definition of 'detective novels' -- for Haycraft, it seems, such storytelling method as used in popular TV series 'Columbo' or criminal's viewpoint is strictly experimental. <br /> <br />The book itself offers no fresh perspectives, but as bibliographical source of detective genre 'Murder for Pleasure' contains still precious information that is hard to find elsewhere.	2005-03-24

Lombroso's 'Criminal Woman,' which argues the idea of 'Born Criminal,' still remains very intriguing, if not convincing, to anyone who is interested in Western culture of the late 19th century, especially the criminology.  Lombroso, famous Italian criminologist, is regarded as one of the first ones to apply the scientific methods to the analogy of crimes, and his prolific writings include 'Criminal Man' of which new translation, the editors Nicole Rafter and Mary Gibson promise, is forthcoming in 2005. <br /> <br />[ABOUT THIS TRANSLATION]  The original book was soon translated into English in 1895, but the translated book 'The Femele Offender' was heavily cut and censored.  According to the editors, this book restores the balance of the original's chapters, in order to give a full coverage of the author's idea.  However, this new translation is also abridged to make it readable and accessable, deleting the repetitions and overlappings in the original book.      <br /> <br />As the title of the book suggests, Lombroso and his co-worker Guilielmo Ferrero researched the field of crimes commited by females, and they tried to establish a theory about the origins of their supposedly anti-social behaviors.  As I am not a criminologist myself, I should not summerize his quite curious (so I thought) theory, but his methods are worth noting here. <br /> <br />As is the case with many scientists of the 19th century, Lombroso often categorize his subject into several groups -- like 'The Criminal Woman' 'The Normal Woman' and 'The Prostitutes' (he considered prostitution as an independent type of crime) and further subdivides them (like 'Born Prostitutes' and 'Occasional Prostitutes') to compare the physical or psychological traits of the females. <br /> <br />What is more strange (and ridiculous, you may say) to the reader today is that when he tries to explain the characteristics of females among the 'normal' group, Lombroso even includes the female animals (including insects), with numerous examples that seem to belong to zoology, not anthropology now.  So you will read a section 'Love among Animal Species' in which he quotes a female spider devouring the male after mating, along with the examples of cruel felony commited by female persons.  You might not believe me, but the book has a section about the 'Crimes in the Animal World.' <br /> <br />And interestingly, in spite of his methods, not all his illustrations are not scientific, because his examples sit uncomfortably beside his quotations from popular proverbs and the reference to the literature (Tennyson, Sand, and most frequently, Zola).  It's like reciting poetry in the class of biology.   <br /> <br />More unsettling idea (which would invite the severest attack for being extremely politically incorrect if written by modern writers now) is the part in which Lombroso deals with the 'anomalities' of the crminals.  Here is one of the examples you read in the book: Lombroso writes, 'Murderers, poisoners, and arsonists have the most prominent cheekbones ....'  You see?  With many photos and illustrations, Lombroso shows the 'abnormal' traits of the female criminals, claiming here is a new type among us. <br /> <br />So you will read this book as one of the historical proof that shows you how people thought about the things immediate to them.  To those who are interested in criminology and sociology this book will be most useful, particularly if you want to know something about the then prevalent idea of degeneration.	2005-03-16

Whatever the intention of the writer Caroline Clive might have been, the titular hero of the novel is really a unique creation of hers, a seemingly respectable gentleman living in a rich country house. <br /> <br />'Paul Ferroll' starts with a murder case.  Mr. Ferroll's wife, not the most amicable person in the household, was found dead one morning.  One person is arrested, but no one knows the criminal for sure.  But whoever the killer might be, one strange thing impresses the neighbors -- Paul Ferroll, stern, clever, rich, and respectable gentleman, loses no time to marry another woman.  Happily married, Paul Ferroll, however, makes it a rule to keep apart from the people in the country.  But while they are in need, he is the first to offer help, even to surpress a riot and shoot its ringleader. <br /> <br />The book is no crime novel for keen-eyed readers would soon detect the truths.  The book is more about the character Paul Ferroll, a gentleman who remains a mystery through the book.  His actions and motives for them are not easy to interprete even now, and the book refuses an easy categorization.  It might be no longer a popular method among academics to guess the writer's original intention, but surely 'Paul Ferroll' poses an interesting question because it keeps vague attitudes toward the violence and crimes the novel describes. <br /> <br />Sadly, the story itself is far from perfect.  The narration is very bumpy, and the topics Caroline Clive takes up do not always fit in the right places.  There are some obvious barrowings from another works, and you might lose patience with the inconsistent styles of writings. (For example, you get several short chapters, and then very long ones after them.) <br /> <br />Interesting but not necessarily a 'must' read, 'Paul Ferroll' would engage some readers, especially when they are fond of Victorian novels.  A curio. <br /> <br />After the original publication, Caroline Clive added a short chapter CONCLUDING NOTE, which sounds like her apologia.  See if your edition has it.	2005-02-27

That is, The Tichborne Claimant case, which seized the national attention in the late 1860s and early 70s in England.  The case is so improbable and ridiculous at first sight, but it is all true. <br /> <br />In 1865, one Authur Orton, living in the frontier town of Wagga Wagga (I'm not kidding), Australia, visited the local lawyer, and claimed that he is Roger Charles Tichborne, the heir to the one of the most wealthiest aristocrats.  Roger was supposed to be lost at sea 11 years before, and presumed dead then. <br /> <br />This seemingly typical case of fraud develop into one of the longest trials (including two, civil and crimial) in British court when Roger's mother, crudulous old lady, believed that HE is the real Roger.  Things get more complex (and funny, unintentionally) after the people in general also start to support Arthur Orton, and moreover, one of his lawyers, very hot-tempered, begins his speech before the judge in the most ill-advised manners. <br /> <br />Physically, Atrhur (very fat) never looked like slim Roger.  Authur spoke only English while Roger's first language was French.  But somehow this apparently easy case languished even after the truths were too obvious to ignore. <br /> <br />Gedded MacGregor's book records the facts about this now almost forgotten historical events, using the documents and letters.  Though the writer's own 'wise' remarks about the case are unnecessary, the book itself is always readable, and the things described themseves are no doubt intriguing.  The book is nothing that would help you understand more the Victorian people,  literature, or society, -- the case is too original for that -- but it surely is a proof that some people just don't change. <br /> <br />Recommeded for those interested in unique trials in Victorian era.	2005-02-15

Few people read these novels today, but they were once very popular, and if you read the book, you will see the reason. <br /> <br />Boothby's novel, which was serialized in 1895 (2 years before the publication of 'Dracula'), follows the adventure of our  hero/narrator Hatteras, a white raised in the South Seas, who literally saves a beautiful lady (named Phyllis) from ruffians, falls in love with her, encounters the arch-villain Dr. Nikola, and tries to save the day.  Really.  The novel includes the globe-trotting story that leads us from Australia to the South Seas via Egypt, and the narration is full of incredible dangers.  <br /> <br />And Dr. Nikola, first-rate mastermind of evil schemes, remains in the shadow all through the story, hatching plans ala Dr. No or Spectre in 007 series.  Shrewd Dr. Nikola, always one step ahead of the brave hero, uses even mesmerism to make the targeted victim listen to what he says.  His attire is always that of gentleman, with a jet-black cat perched on the shoulder watching you! <br /> <br />Boothby hit the right mood to create this kind of cliff-hanging thriller, providing set-pieces of suspence to each chapters, which is followed by another.  While you read, do not think about the plot.  It is like Eugene Sue (if you know his 'The Wandering Jew'), with ultra-fast-paced suspence. <br /> <br />Now forgotten, and perhaps undeservedly so, Boothby's 'Dr. Nikola' is still interesting today.  Pity that he couldn't keep up with the pace (he made sequels, none of which are as good as this, according to John Sutherland, the editor of Oxford edition), but the first entry is very entertaining.  Try it if you like John Buchan or that kind of thrilling novels.	2005-01-31

Published in 1906, this short story collection surely makes fun of the rules of detective story genre, and moreover, his stories can stand on their own, offering fairly reasonable and imaginative mysteries presented in various styles.   <br /> <br />Oxford Popular Fiction edition gives you eight short stories featuring Valmont and his amusing adventures, plus two rare pastiches of Holmes.  The first of the two pastiches is named 'The Adventure of Sherlaw Kombs' -- well, the title tells you all -- which is a fairly funny tale, while the other one deals with a case in which Conan Doyle is blackmailed by Holmes himself (oh, so Holmes was a real person after all.) <br /> <br />I do not introduce these eight Valmont stories in detail, but I can tell that they are quite amusing in the following two ways.  First, Robert Barr, born in Scotland then moving to Canada, is in a good position to write about the Englishness from outside.  He (or Valmont, narrator) playfully writes satire about the way of life and thinking in England, especially the police activities, and the results are often amusing and even incisive.  French police can search the house while the owner is away from there, he says (yes, that's about the story of Poe).  But here in England, to his great dismay, never, making his investigation all the more difficult. <br /> <br />The other merit is to enjoy it book's spoof on crime fiction genre, which is done with a surprisingly subtle touch.  The title like 'The Absent-Minded Coterie' might sound vulgar at first -- of course, that's named with Conan Doyle's one famous short story about people with red hair in mind.  Valmont's tongue-in-cheek story, however, does not rely on this one-joke idea.  It is unpredictable, leading the reader from a case of forged silver coins to a very original (but improbable maybe) crime,which the great detective's 'absent-minded theory' reveals.   <br /> <br />Compared with 'The Thinking Machine' or other rivals of Holmes, Valmont has become an obscure figure, I am afraid.  But his character has definite voice of his own, and those stories, not just spoof and satire of Doyle and other crime stories, are far more entertaining, imaginative, and memorable than you might expect.	2005-01-26

Hornung, edited by Richard Lancelyn Green] <br /> <br />This book (originally published in 1899) is the first collection of stories about A.J. Raffles, 'gentleman thief' and first-rate cricket player.  E.W. Hornung, who married Conan Doyle's sister Connie, presents a unique pair in English literature: they are Raffles, debonair and handsome thief (but the world knows him only as a cricket player) and 'Bunny' who records the adventures of his friend in the tradition of Watson. <br /> <br />The collection has eight stories: 'The Ides of March' (telling us how they met each other after their schooldays), 'A Costume Piece,''Gentlemen and Players,''Le Premier Pas,''Wilful Murder,''Nine Point of the Law,''The Return Match,' and 'The Gift of the Emperor,' in which Raffles vanishes before us ... for now. <br /> <br />As the nature of the protagonist tells you, none of the stories are so-called detective stories though they involve crimes or even murder.  There are a few elaborate descriptions about how to, say, steal diamonds, and Raffels surely uses interesting ruses, but today they are no longer fresh, and many readers would detect his tricks before the slow-learning narrator Bunny does. <br /> <br />But the characters are very lively, especially Raffles, who could be very cynical, nasty, or even dangerous if he wants to.  Holmes might have refrained from openly despising Watson's thick head; Raffles never does, who looks as if having fun, completely mystifying poor Bunny who is left in the dark until the very end of the story.  And in spite of the familiar gimmicks, the story itself takes often unpredictable turns. <br /> <br />[About Penguin Classics edition] Penguin is perhaps the only critical edition of Raffles stories.  Though it includes only eight stories (Raffles later comes back, as Holmes does), this edition has nearly 40 pages of helpful notes, plus Richard Lancelyn Green's informative introduction (more than 50 pages) which covers the biographical matters about Hornung, the possible models of Raffles, and the further reading list.  Everything is written with detailed facts, which clearly indicate the editor's love toward the Raffles stories.  If you have already read all the Raffles stories, this book still is worth your money.	2005-01-17

Sinnema. <br /> <br />'Self-Help' was published in 1859 in England, and became the instant bestseller, with 20,000 copied sold within the year after publication, making Samuel Smiles a household name.  It is hard to categorize this book into any genre, but basically 'Self-Help' is a statement on the virtues of hard working, or in Smiles's favorite word, 'perseverance,' amply illustrated by many examples of biographical records collected by Smiles. <br /> <br />The chapter names would show the contents -- 'Self-Help: National and Individual'; 'Leaders of Industry: Inventors and Producers'; 'Three Great Potters'; 'Application and Perseverance'; 'Helps and Opportunities'; 'Workers in Art'; 'Industry and the Peerage'; 'Energy and Courage'; 'Men on Business'; 'Money: It's Use and Abuse'; 'Self-Culture: Facilities and Difficulties'; 'Example: Models'; 'Character: The True Gentleman.' <br /> <br />Each chapter tells you the examples of hard work and its eventual triumph, and with many biographical episodes, Smiles argues the importance of being earnest, no matter where the supposed readers belong to the social ladder of England.  For example, in the Chapter 'Three Great Potters' you can see the life of three potters -- Palissy, Bottgher, and Wedgwood -- and how they. in spite of the numerous obstacles rushing to them, succeeded in their art, with which their names were recorded in the history. <br /> <br />Like this, Smiles' book has a pattern -- it states its point first, championing the virtue of hard work, then he supports his statement with mini-biographies about many people, which include that of mechanics, philanthropists, scientist, musicians, soldiers, politicians, merchants, and many others.  But as this is written in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, many pages are devoted to the inventors of new machines, or their privation, suffering, and final victory. <br /> <br />Often his styles are preachy, and Smiles didn't include many remarkable women who should have been included (if he does, those women's roles are often as men's 'help-mates'), and it has been pointed out since the publication that the cases Smiles cites as examples are all successful ones.  But as it was written long time ago, we should take the book as it is now. <br /> <br />Oxford editon included concise introduction by Peter W. Sinnema, and helpful notes and glossary of the names the book deals with. <br /> <br />This is not a so-called 'how-to' book (if you want to read that way, of course you can), but a good proof as to how Victorian working class and lower-middle class thought about being 'viruous' and 'respectable.'  If you want to see the glimpse of Victorian ideas among ordinary people, and how such ideas greatly influenced the writers like Dickens who created Mr. Bounderby in 'Hard Times,' you should read this book. <br />	2004-09-15

The present selection gives the best part of the original four volume book, which captures exactly what the title says -- London labour and the poverty-stricken people living there. <br /> <br />The selction includes some figures or statistics about the working class people, such as the estimated amount of money these workers gain every day (and meagre one), but the most interesting part is the first-hand records about the ways of life of various lines of works in London, directly taken from the people engaged in these works.   <br /> <br />The jobs (and some of them  hardly deserve the name 'jobs') recorded here are, to name a few, street-sellers such as fried fish, watercresses, matches, baked potatoes, etc.; street-buyers such as old clothes or 'dust'; street-performers like 'conjurors,' musicians, or fire-eaters (with his own descriptions about how to eat fire), but the most fascinating is the records about boys (and some girls) who run away from parents, and lives in the street of London, who literally lives by begging or stealing. <br /> <br />Many interesting facts are recorded by Mayhew (or his assistants), directly from the persons the book deals with, and the original words spoken by there labourers are preserved as much as possible.  To read, or to listen to them is one of the greatest merits of the book, for the languages of the interviewees retain the peculiar speeches you find in many Dickensian characters, and in fact you will realize that Dickens didn't exaggerate when he created Sam Weller. <br /> <br />And the London you see here is the London Charles Dickens knew.  What did Jo in 'BleakHouse' was sweeping in the street?  Who gave that permission?  What is the nature of 'the dust' you hear in 'Our Mutual Friend'?  What was the regulations of the 'workhouse'?  All these thing are answered in this vividly realized collections of the Victorian working class portraits.       <br /> <br />This book is still a valuable source for anyone who is interested in Victorian period, and will be.

So he grabs the opportunity to accampany the exploration team to prove the theory of Professor Challenger that there is a plateau untouched by the modern civilization deep in the South America where extinct animals are still living.<br />So, there go four characters -- Challenger, Edward Malone, Lord John Roxton (a nice-guy type of sportsman), and Professor Summerlee, who wants to disprove Challenger's theory by his own hand.  The adventures themselves including the encounter with dinosaurs or other creatures are written with vivid touch, even though some parts are clearly dated.  And some readers may feel uncomfortable when reading some violent scenes. <br />This story is filmed many times -- most as early as in 1925 -- but the ending is much different.  Interestingly, the dinosaurs are not the main feature of the novel (even though Penguin's cover suggests the terrible havoc they do on the city, which is unashamedly borrowed in Steven Spielberg's film of the same title).<br />&quot;The Lost World&quot; (1912) was written immediately before WWI, and perhaps was the last romance that could depict the heroism in this way, in a remote country, against the exotic background of the Amazon.  If you like it, read &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; or &quot;She&quot; by H. Rider Haggard, which were written in the late 19th century.  <br />&quot;The Poison Belt&quot; the second &quot;Professor Challenger&quot; tale sounds more apocalyptic, beginning with the newspaper column of the Professor who predicts the mass destruction of the human beings.  The story brings back the four characters of the last adventure, and shows how the world ends as Malone et al. see it.  Though the story lacks scientific precision (what's &quot;ether&quot;?, you may say) and the final chapter is a huge letdown, the story is full of impact, describing the fear and terror of the people facing death.  Some parts of it still look very modern and immediate, as if the scenes from &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; or &quot;28 Days Later.&quot;<br />The last two shorts are comparatively weak, but not bad.  &quot;The Terror of Blue John Gap&quot; is, as the title suggests, about the terror of the underground while &quot;The Horror of the Heights&quot; could be rephrased as &quot;the horror seen by a daredevil pilot.&quot;  <br />The Penguin edition has Philip Gooden's insightful introduction which also tells us the real-life models of the characters.  He also provides useful notes, and the book has the original illustrations (the kind of garish drawings capturing the shocking moments of the story), which are pure delight to see.  A good read for holidays.	2004-03-24

US	52287429	R2FS1K864JB0IE	1551112434	424220149	The Moonstone (Broadview Editions)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	One of the Greatest Victorian Novels by Storytelling Master	First published in 1868, Wilkie Collins' &quot;The Moonstone&quot; has been never out of print.  This fact testifies the popularity of the book, but somehow because of the famous comment by TS Eliot, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is likely to be regarded as 'detective fiction.'  The fact is slightly different, and you have to keep that in mind before you read it.<br />The story is absolutely the classic style of &quot;Who-Done-It.&quot;  The Moonstone, a sacred Hindo stone is stolen from India, and makes its way to the peaceful Yorkshire countryhouse where the rich daughter Rachel Verinder lives with her mother.  On her birthday night, however, immediately after the stone is presented to the young lady, it vanishes without a trace.  So, who stole it?  Or is it just 'missing,' as the inimitable London detective Sgt. Cuff thinks?<br />The story sounds like Agatha Christie (who, like Collins, wrote stories about the British middle-class), but if you are looking for some ingenious 'trick' or something, you will be disapponited.  The story is written BEFORE Sherlock Holmes is born, and though the basic elements of detective stories can be found here, Collins does not use them as you might expect the later writers like Conan Doyle do.  I cannot reveal much, but I can tell you that the whereabout of the stone is not necessarily the primary concern of the novel.<br />The most strikingly original aspect of the novel is its characters.  Remember, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is primarily a Victorian novel, and Wilkie Collins is one of the best friends of Charles Dickens, who wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot; which attacks the idea of 'gentleman.'  The story is told by many characters themselves, and they unwittingly reveal the hidden side of their personalities in the narrative.  The best case is the statement of Miss Clack, whose too religious attitudes conceal her surpressed curiosity (and perhaps love) for handsome philanthropist Godfrey Ablewhite.  Clack's narrative, always amusing and in a sense grotesque, is one of the greatest among the 19th English novels.<br />About the mystery of the novel ... well, there are lots of them in there, but they are rather about how and why these colorful characters did certain things or didn't.  Rachel Verinder, independent and strong-willed (Collins loved this type of females), certainly knows something about the missing stone, but she never talks about it.  The housemaid Rosanna Spearman knows something about the 'smear' of the paint (one of the crucial points of the story), but she never talks about it ... until the time you know the reason.  The 'mystery' is about these people, rather than about the Moonstone.<br />{ABOUT THE BROADVIEW EDITION by STEVE FARMER}<br />Broadview's edition of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; comes in handy for academic use, so let me record the details of the book.  It has Mr. Farmer's informative introduction that follows the modern critical readings of the book.  Plus, you see the novel's contemporary reviews, and the play version of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (which Collins himself made for the stage) and even the reviews of that play.  You also get the excerpts of the letters concerning the novel and the play, and the brief newspaper accounts of the real-life cases of Constance Kent and Northumberland Street (both of which became part of the story).  The long (and well-chosen) list of select bibliography is included.<br />You may not find the same thrill as you have in Doyle or Christie, but &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is still a good example of great storytelling.

Plus, you see the novel's contemporary reviews, and the play version of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (which Collins himself made for the stage) and even the reviews of that play.  You also get the excerpts of the letters concerning the novel and the play, and the brief newspaper accounts of the real-life cases of Constance Kent and Northumberland Street (both of which became part of the story).  The long (and well-chosen) list of select bibliography is included.    <br />You may not find the same thrill as you have in Doyle or Christie, but &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is still a good example of great storytelling.  Read it like you read Dickens, another great storyteller.<br />&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is made a TV show starring Greg Wise in UK in the late 1990s.  This version is also great, keeping the atmosphere of the original novel intact.  Find the video and see it.	2004-01-05

Don't Know, But Still an Interesting Book	[Warning] This penguin reprint book has been originally published as &quot;Historical Enigmas&quot; in 1974, and before that, partly as &quot;Historical Whodunits&quot; (1955) and &quot;Enigmas of History&quot; (1957).  Beware before buying it.<br />The new title &quot;Who Was the Man in the Iron Mask&quot; is misleading, so let me correct it.  The writer Hugh Ross Williamson, prolific novelist and historian (and many others), has written this interesting book about English history, in which he explores the scandals and gossips such as the speculated identity of the father of Elizabeth I, or the murderers of the princes in the Tower.  So, the book is mainly about the history of England, not France.<br />The contents are:<BR> 1.History and the Writer<BR> 2.The Death of William Rufus<BR> 3.The Princes in the Tower<BR> 4.The Identity of Perkin Warbeck<BR> 5.The Parentage of Queen Elizabeth I<BR> 6.The Murder of Amy Robsart<BR> 7.Holyrood and Kirk o'Field<BR> 8.The Gowrie Conspiracy<BR> 9.The Gunpowder Plot<BR>10.The Murder of Sir Thomas Overbury<BR>11.The Poisoning of King James I<BR>12.The Assassination of Colonel Rainsborough<BR>13.The Executioner of King Charles I<BR>14.The Campden Wonder <BR>15.The Mystery of James de la Cloche<BR>16.The Man in the Iron Mask<BR>17.The Murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey<BR>18.The Innocence of Sir John Fenwick<BR>19.The Appin Murder<BR>20.The Diamond Necklace<BR>21.The Wives of King George IV<br />(Chap.1 is a rather preachy introduction you can skip over.  Chap. 3 is indirectly about Richard III; Chap.16 is of course about the mysterious man in Dumas' famous novel (or DiCaprio's movie), and the proposed theory is certainly unique.  Chap.19 concerns partly RL Stevenson's classic novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot;; and Chap.20 deals with the interesting case about the necklace which accelerated the downfall of Marie Antoinette, recently made into a picture starring Hilary Swank.)    <br />And don't be wrong here.  Williamson postulates, butnever insists.  Like many books on the truths of, say, Jack the Ripper, he shows many intriuging aspects of many well-known episodes in English history, but some people, especially academic historians, would find the book too clever.  To his credit, Williamson, who seems to heartily dislike &quot;textbook history&quot; and &quot;historical propagandas,&quot; does not offer any conclusive theories about these matters.  He just suggests, but to some, too strongly.  <br />It is true, however, that there were scandals and rumors surrounding these cases above, and people are still intrigued by the enigmas in history.  And like the tantalizing questions such as &quot;Who shot down the Red Baron?&quot; or &quot;What ever happened to the still missing author of &quot;The Devil's Dictionary,&quot; the answers will never be revealed.  This conclusion, Hugh Ross Williamson is, and all of us are, ready to accept.<br />Some complaints about this reprint.  As there is no introduction attached to the text, we don't know whether or not new information has been unearthed since the original publication of the book.  We need the opinions from the thrid party, hopefully from historians, but we are left alone to judge the authenticity of the book.  (And this complaint goes to this Penguin Classic History series in general.)<br />I know I cannot use the book in history class in school, but still I find it very interesting.  But I also know that I am no historian.  Read it as a detective's dossier.	2003-11-08
US	52287429	R11SM8C75DFZB6	1551110172	817022878	The Evil Genius	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Novel Ahead of its Time: Victorian Domestic Drama &amp; Divorce	Wilkie Collins' &quot;The Evil Genuis&quot; was published in 1886, about three years before the author's death.  It is unanimously agreed that Wilkie Collins' works in 1870-80s are inferior to his four masterpieces in the 60s (such as &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone&quot;), but &quot;The Evil Genuis&quot; is a welcome surprise because this is surprisingly well-made and occasionally, very arresting.<br />The novel is well ahead of its time, dealing with such topics as divorce and child-custody, and unlike other works of him in this era, or writers like Charles Reade, the whole effect is not didactic.  There is no murder or stolen jewel, but still this domestic drama is quite engaging in its own way.<br />The story starts with a courtroom scene, where the procedure of the jury to decide whether a certain man is guilty or not is described with Collins' amusingly satrical touch.  But this interesting sequence is just an introduction to the main part, in which an ill-treated girl Sydney Westerfield is taken under the wing of handsome Mr. Herbert Linley as governess.  Herbert is living with his pretty and merry daughter Kitty, his amiable wife and her acid-tongued mother in Scotland.  And don't forget, Sydney is sweet-natured and for all her painful past, she is very beautiful.<br />A beautiful governess and husnand in the same house.  You should know what happens next (like, Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson in the film &quot;The Governess&quot;).  You see a newly-born difference between the husband and wife, and then the officious mother-in-law makes it worse.  It is a usual course, you may say, but this is a Victorian novel; there are lots of melodramatic coincidences that help the tension rise higher and higher.  As melodrama with surprisingly modern subjevt matter &quot;The Evil Genius&quot; has considerble power, written with complelling dialogues.  The child Kitty's are memorable among them, who must live among this acrimonious atomosphere.<br />The rest of the story is unpredictable and very interesting, showing the Victorian way of handling the matters like custody and even possibility of re-marriage, but Collins' stance is very ambiguous through the novel about these guilty people.  You may remember the historical fact that Wilkie Collins himself never married, but was very happy continuing his relations with two women at the same time.<br />A few words about the title's &quot;Genius.&quot;  You soon realize to whom this apparently self-evident word refers, but in fact the &quot;genius&quot; means here not the people like Edison, but rather, &quot;a spirit.&quot;  This &quot;Evil Genius&quot; is used as a kind of antonym (opposite meaning) to &quot;Angel of the House,&quot; referring to the very meddling person.  That character's description is very compelling, one of the best creations Collins made.<br />Not his best, but still &quot;The Evil Genius&quot; deserves to be read by those who are interested in social matters like divorce and child-custody in Victorian period, or in any good domestic dramas.<br />[about BROADVIEW LITERARY TEXT]  Broadview's edition includes Prof. Graham Law's introduction, and 9 pages of notes which are helpful.  Also, it has 5 excerpts of contemporary reviews (4 pages), brief samples of advertisements for governess, fashionable news (news about the celebrities), and reports of the real divorce cases.	2003-09-20
US	52287429	R2ZMAR17EJ04FP	0812966783	20145244	The Trail of the Serpent (Modern Library Classics)	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	Mary Braddon's First Novel Is a Lurid Melodrama	Mary Elizabeth Braddon's first novel is a lurid melodrama in which you see plenty of crimes -- murder, blackmail, revenge, etc.  Every element found in melodramaric story is thrown into the book, and not surprisingly, it even has some rudimentary detective novel quality.    The story is rather simple; it is about a man called \\"Daredevil Dick\\" who is wrongly arrested for killing his rich uncle.  Despite the strong belief of Mr. Peters (who is to play the detective role) that Richard is innocent, his plea is ignored.    But that is only the beginning of the gripping story, which goes between a muddy town of Slopperton and fashoionable society of Paris.  The story is too improbable but thankfully always moving on, providing many dramatic and often humorous moments about the fate of Richard and those who try to rescue him, and it culminates in their hunt for the villain who vanished from the crime scene.    The book is weak as a detective novel, so do not expect something like \\"The Moonstone.\\"  As I said, it is more like a melodrama, and there are countless occasions of incredible coincidences.  But that is one of the conventions you can find in this kind of popular novels intended for commercial purpose.  It is interesting for us to see that Braddon does not still find her own voice; her style in this book is a strange concoction of Dickens and melodrama.  Read the opening chapter and you instantly recognize the influence of Dickensian sentences about the rainy London in \\"Bleak House.\\"    The novel itself (which was first published as \\"Three Times  Dead\\" and later revised and retitled as the present one) is not as good as her works like \\"Lady Audley's Secret\\" and others, its flaws being too palpable.  Still, if you like her novels or these Victorian or 19th century thriller -- like Eugene Sue's novels -- you might be interested in the book as I was.    This modern library edition has Sarah Waters' introduction (which I found not so impressive), but more remarkable thing about it is that it has also the afterword and notes by acclaimed Victorian scholar Chris Willis.  The notes (32 pages) are extensive and helpful, but more helpful is her afterword, which puts Braddon in context of the history of detective fiction.  Much more informative than obligatory \\"further reading\\" list.    And the book also has the reprint of Braddon's own memoir titled \\"My First Novel\\" published in 1893.  This short account by her own pen does not reveal much about the book or herself, but it has several clear-cut illustrations of her house in Richmond.	2003-05-16
US	52287429	R26KVDXFRE1BG0	0810829606	946381122	Charles Dickens on the Screen	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	A Good Introduction to the World of Filmed Dickens	Published in 1996, &quot;Charles Dickens on the Screen&quot; surveys the filmed works of Dickens from the silent era, including TV adaptaions.  The book is rather silm in volume, and not so much a thorough discussion on the cinematic skills employed on the screen as an introduction to the vast field of Dickensian films (more than 100), but still Michael Pointer keeps his book always readable and immensely interesting.<br />After the brief introduction, the book begins with a discussion about &quot;Dickensian&quot; elements in original books, and their relations to visual media.  The agrument at first is a bit too general and obvious, but you should just read on.  After the third chapter the writer speeds up his discussion, giving well-researched comments on the films, backed up quotations from various materials.  Though the materials might not look rare  in the eyes of those who are already versed in film history -- autobiographical writings, comtemporary reviews, the synopsis, etc. --  they help those who do not have knowledge on movie history to gain the historical viewpoint to glance back the current of many films.<br />Chapters 2-4 are devoted to discussion on the silent films.  It is now a nearly impossible thing to make a perfect survey about this era, because many of the films are lost forever (the reason is explained by the words of director Frank Llyod in the book), and considering that fact, Mr. Pointer did a very good job, even though the argument often seems to lack in power, relying on second-hand knowledge.  But that cannot be helped.<br />After Chapter 5, the discussion is about &quot;talkies,&quot; and the book gets better and better as you read.  His discussion covers the films until the 1993 &quot;Edwin Drood,&quot; and, instead of displaying tedious scene-to-scene analysis which might have done harm to the book by its slow tempo, he gives each film concise summery of its characteristics and his opinions about it, which may disagree with yours, butmostly fair and to the point.  Mr.  Pointer does not neglect the more recent TV products, and gives fair judgement on them.  There is even a section where the author deals with parodies! (such as British cult TV series &quot;Avengers&quot; -- remember Mrs. Emma Peel?&quot;)  <br />The book also contains a list of films (until BBC's &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;), which is now superceded by our internet source like imdb.  Of more interest is the cluster of clear stills (21 in all) which includes a rare one that shows Charles Laughton as Mr. Micawber in the 1935 &quot;David Copperfield.&quot;  After one-week shooting, he left the film, and as you know, W.C. Fields took the part.  Though not a perfect book, since so many have been released after its publication, &quot;Charles Dickens on the Screen&quot; is a good book to know more about the area of filmed classics, which should be given more attention from both academic and non-asademic people.	2003-03-21
US	52287429	R36CPS2FTLFNYJ	0375761225	82761703	Washington Square (Modern Library Classics)	Books	4	89	96	N	N	Most Accesible James Novel About Daughter, Father, & Suitor	\\"Washington Square\\", published in 1880, is not, and will not be, regarded as Henry James's best novel -- the honor would go to \\"The Portrait of a Lady\\" or much later works like \\"The Wings of the Dove\\" -- but this short but richly woven book deserve our attention.  The book is always readable and intriguing while it does not fail to deliver the amazingly realistic characters living in New York City of the 19th century.  Certainly, this is the best place for any beginners of James to start.<br />The book starts with an introduction of a New York physician Dr. Sloper and his only daughter Catherine.  While the doctor gained respectable position among the patients, he loses his wife suddenly after the birth of Catherine, who grows up to be a not particularly clever nor beautiful girl.  Catherine, painfully shy, becomes a dutiful, but perhaps dull, daughter, the kind of a girl whose awkward behaviors her father approves always with a little detached attitude.  <br />Then, comes a good-looking man Morris Townsend, who has no money but gives a word of \\"gentleman.\\"  But what does that mean when Doctor suspects this is just another fortune hunter, who is seeking for the money Catherine is to inherit after his death?  Still, Doctor is half amused, even entertained, by this unexpected visitor who now seems to have gained the love of his daughter.  But he didn't expect that Catherine would show surprising obstinate attitude in spite of his threat of disinheriting her.<br />The book is written, as a whole, with a very tragic note, but as you read on, you will find that, just like Jane Austen's narrator, \\"Washington Square\\" has an amusing aspect of comedy at first.  The meddling widow Mrs. Penniman, whose wild  imagination is one of her weakness, is a good example.  She runs around between Morris and Catherine, only to annoy both of them.  Henry James's touch when he treats these characters, however, sounds more incisive and even colder than Jane Austen's, if not totally cruel --and the cruelty is gradually obvious as the plot unfolds.<br />Our main concern is about Catherine.  The story is in itself  trite and insignificant (James heard the original episode which the book is based on, in England from actress Fanny Kemble, and the brief note remains), but it is the growth (or change) of the apparently insipid heroine, and the interations between her and  other characters (or between those other characters) that always impress us greatly.  James's pen ruthlessly cuts into the hearts of those characters, and the intense, skillfully-constructed  dialogue which show what is going on in the characters would instantly grip the readers' mind.<br />Some readers might champion more condensed prose of \\"The Golden Bowl\\", deeming \\"Washington Square\\" as too lightweight.  In a sense, it is, I admit; the novel is not long, and the syntax is very easy to understand (for James, I mean).  Still, the book is never dull, always fast-paced (for James, again), and the touching fate of the heroine Catherine is not a thing to be missed.<br />The novel is turned into films and they are also great, I must add.  William Wyler's version is a masterpiece, with Olivia de Havilland/Montgomery Clift/Ralph Richardson trio, but more recent production made in 1997 is also good.	2002-12-27

Immediately after the success of the former one, Mary Elizabeth Braddon wrote \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" which also became an instant bestseller, quickly making her a celebrity.  But, in more than one sense, as you see later.<br />The story of Braddon's book is clearly inspired by Collins's \\"The Woman in White\\" (especially by Laura's story), but it is quite unfair to call \\"Lady Audley\\" a poor imitation.  (And remember, Collins's story is also said to be based on a French book recording actual crime cases).  Lady Audley takes a more defying view on the Victorians, roles of women in particular, and that's the real reason she was such a \\"sensation,\\" and is again getting our attention now.<br />The story goes like this: Lucy, a governess without family, is loved by Sir Michael Audley, a rich landowner of Audley Court, Essex, and marries him to the chagrin of some people who look at her as an adventuress.  No matter how people think, however, they are living happily.<br />In the meanwhile, George Talboys, after his long, hard days in Australia searching for goldmine, finally comes back to London, after many years, with money to make his wife happy.  But when he encountered his old friend Robert Audley, nephew of Sir Michael, he accidentally knows that his beloved wife is no longer alive.  <br />Those two seemingly unrelated events begin to get entangled after George's sudden missing.  Robert starts his own investigation, as if beckoned by a fate, and he, collecting evidences, gradually comes to one inevitable conclusion.<br />And ... let me say this first; \\"Lady Audley\\" is an absorbing book, but absorbing not in the way a good detective story is.  The \\"secret\\" in point is, one often mistakes, NOT the secret you can easily discover in the early stage of the plot.  (You must wait to see the nature ofLady's secret at the end of the book, which is still controversial.)  The story is melodramatic and sometimes predictable, but the real virtue of the book is the portrait of the strong-willed heroine, who dares to challenge the social codes of women in Victorian era.<br />The book is full of action that you might find in any potboilers, shocking for the comtemporary people, which includes: murder, arson, secret passage, blackmail, you name it.  But the way Braddon handles them is always steady and well-controlled, and at some places they look unexpectedly modern, reading like a movie script, anticipating the cinematic treatment in the early 20th century (this had been made into films three times in silent-film days, and once on TV even in 2000)  Her book has many flaws, surely, but should be never called dull.<br />Mary Elizabeth Braddon, when she was working on this book, was living with John Maxwell, ambitious publisher in debt, and she was the main provider of income.  While living together (and John was still married to another woman in asylum, which makes an interesting parallel with George Eliot), she wrote with a frantic speed.  Through 1861-62, when she wrote \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" -- and she was also writing for cheaper periodicals under false name! -- Braddon confesses that she wrote the Third Book (the final third part) of the \\"Lady Audley\\" in a fortnight.  Considering the fact, the book is incredibly tight, and infallibly engaging.	2002-09-20
US	52287429	RM8SO9TZPVEZI	0140437541	348298397	The Italian (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	49	51	N	N	Still Gripping Classic Tale of Gothic Terror and Suspense	I read this book in Japanese translation years ago, and recently read it again in the original language in order to write a paper.  And I can say, both times the book gave me a good, healthy amount of thrill and joy.<br />Published in 1796, \\"The Italian\\" became an instant success, cementing the fame of Ann Radcliffe among the liteary circle.  Her name has been already well-known with her previous work \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" two years before, but in my book this  follow-up is better than the other.  Of course, it depends on your view which is superior, but it is commonly agreed that Ann Radcliffe's position in the history of English literature is secured by those two Gothic classics, which clearly gave inspiration to Jane Austen, who wrote the joyful \\"Northanger Abbey.\\" <br />The story is rather simple in the beginning.  It tells of a romantic love of young dashing nobleman Vivaldi in Naples, who falls in love with a girl Ellena.  But his plan  of marriage is soon interrupted by the vicious monk Schedoni.  Then ensue abduction, murder (attempted or not), and the Inquisition.  There are lot of suspense, terror, and thrill that come from the fluent narrative of Radcliffe, who knows how to engage the readers' attention.  (And thankfully, \\"The Italian\\" is free from any lengthy poems that are found aplenty among \\"Udolpho.\\")<br />To be sure, the third part of the book is damaged by its too complicated relations between characters, and too rapid pen of the author to wrap up the events with rational explanations about the mysterious things in the first part of the book, but the whole book manages to sustain our interest to the end.  Radcliffe's effusive descriptions of landscapes (with a little sentimental touch) found in \\"Udolpho\\" are gone (but not completely), and the plot is tightly knit so that we can enjoy the fast-paced adventure of the hero and the heroine.  The best part of the book is, probably, the middle section where the hero, with his comic relief side-kick,tries to escape from the sinister convent where the heroine is confined to be forced to take a veil.  It's a real page-turner which would put many of today's bestselling author to deserved shame.<br />One of the best Gothic novels ever written, \\"The Italian\\" is  still a gripping tale.  Most regrettabe thing is that the author Radcliffe stopped writing totally after this book for the rest of her life (she died in 1823).  Considering the fact that she had never been to Italy (she travelled abroad only once, in Netherland and Germany), and that her sublime landscapes are proof of her amazingly imaginative power, her early retirement should be lamented by all of us.  But we must be content with what is left.  Enjoy this one.<br />THE PENGUIN EDITION published in 2000 has 10 pages of excerpts from comtemporary reviews, which would help readers with academic purpose.	2002-08-21

A novelist?  A journalist?  A critic?  Or just a guy who loved propaganda?  Whatever it is, he is and will be remembered as the one who wrote \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm.\\"  Still, before he wrote these famous works, he wrote a pretty good book of novel, and that is what you're looking at now.<br />\\"Keep the Aspidistra Flying\\" one of the most starange titles you ever see, is about a \\"poet\\" (and formerly a copywriter for advertizing company) Gordon Comstock, who, with sudden desire to be free from the curse of money, left this good job and starts the life of an aspiring artist.  As he had previously a book of his own poems published (the title \\"Mice\\"), and received a review from The Times Literary Supplement, which said \\"exceptional promise,\\" why not pursue his way as an artist?  And his next project \\"London Pleasure\\" which must be the next Joyce or Eliot will be completed soon, probably next month, or next year perhaps....<br />As his misadventure starts, Rosemary, his long-suffering but always faithful sweetheart, naturally is dismayed, and it takes a long time for him to realize that his happiness, whatever it is, is possible with her presence.  But aside from the romantic aspect of the novel, which in itself is well-written with good portrait of independent Rosemary, the book attracts us with the author's satire on the middle-classness of England, which is represented by those ugly, die-hard aspidistra decorating the windows of every house.  Gordon's loathing of respetability is deftly turned into a dark comedy that attack the parochical mind of some people, sometimes including Gordon himself.  For instance, Gordon, no matter how poor and disheveled he becomes, never lets his girlfriend Rosemary pay the check of lunch because, in a word, it is not proper.  Those who are interested in Englishness might find something amusing in this book, I assure you.<br />As is his satire, Orwell's English style is always full of power, brisk and lively, and never lets you bored.  The only demerit is, as time has changed since then 1936, some names are no longer familiar to us; once hugely popular novelists like Ethel M Dell is mentioned with derogatory comments from Gordon, and her bestselling novel \\"The Way of an Eagle\\" is clearly treated as trash in Orwell's mind, but in the 21st Century whoever read them?  Hence, some part of the book is lost on us if you don't know these names like Dell or Hugh Walpole, but never mind.  Such part consists only small part, and if you don't get it, just skip it.<br />At the time of publishing, \\"Keep the Aspidistra Flying\\" was never a commercial success, and in Orwell's lifeime it was never reprinted, but these facts should not discuorage you from reading it.  It is wickedly funny book that makes you, if not smile, at least grin not a little.<br />The book was made a movie in 1997 as \\"The Merry War\\" starring Richard E Grant and Helena Bohnam Carter.  The film, more inclined to romance side of the book, is also a good one.  Try it.	2002-06-22
US	52287429	R38NZNZIS92ARP	0140432353	39462164	The Golden Bowl (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	31	36	N	N	Ultimate Henry James: Hard to Read But You Will Be Rewarded	The last completed novel by Henry James is, like preceding works of his later era (&quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; comes up to  mind first), very hard to read.  That's the warning to every unwary reader who happens to think about starting to read Henry James anew.<br /><br />The plot is simple: its about two couples of people -- Charlotte and Amerigo, and Adam Verver and his daughter Maggie Verver.  Charlotte loves Amerigo, who, however, decides to marry Maggie.  Soon after that, Charlotte marries Adam Verver, an American millionaire.  Still, Amerigo and Charlotte maintain their former relations as lovers until their secret is discovered by Maggie unexpectedly with an advent of a golden bowl, which looks perfect outward, but deep inside cracked.  Maggie, who greatly adores her deceived father, in turn, starts to move in order to mend the cracked relations, or secure the  apparently happy family life without disturbing the present relations.<br />As this sketch of the story tells you, one of the favorite topics of the 19th century literature -- adultery -- is staged in the center of the book, but the way James handles it is very different from those of other American or British writers.  The meaning is hidden in a web of complicated, even contorted sentences of James, and you have to read often repeatedly to grasp the syntax.  The grammar is sometimes unclear, with his frequent use of pronouns and double negatives, and very often you just have to take time to understand to what person James' &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; really refers to.  It is not a rare thing for you to find that a paragraph starts with those &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; without any hint about its identity, so you just read on until you hit the right meaning of these pronouns.  And this is just one example of the hard-to-chew James prose.  If you think it is pompous, you surely are excused.<br />But as you read on again, you find, behind this entangled  sentences and a rather banal melodramatic story, something intelligent, something about humans that lurks in the dark part of our heart.  I will not pretend that I can understand all of the book, but James clearly shows how we, with a limited ability of our perception, try to act as the characters of the book do, in the given atomosphere of society.  To me, this book is about the way of the people's behavior luminously recorded; about the way of our expressing and perceiving ourselves without uttering them aloud.<br />Gore Vidal says about the book: &quot;James's conversational style was endlessly complex, humourous, unexpected -- euphemistic where most people are direct, and suddenly precise where avoidance or ellipsis is usual (see his introduction of &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; in Penguin Classics edition.  This is exactly the nature of this book, which would either attract or repel you.  Unfortunately, I admit, this is not my cup of tea, for I prefer more story-oriented novels.  Still, if you really want to challenge reading something really substantial, I for one recommend this book.<br />There is a sumptuous film version of the book, starring Uma Thurman and Nick Nolte.  It might be a good idea to watch it before you start reading the book.	2002-06-11

Though part of the low estimation is reasonable (and some of the works in this era testifies to this opinion), many of them are still readable and interesting.   And \\"The Law and the Lady\\" should be classified among those neglected pieces.<br />Probably the first full-length novel featuring female detective, the novel follows the story of heroine Valeria, who marries Eustace happily in the opening of the book.  However, she discovers behind the happy marriage a terrible secret, which involved an unsolved murder case in her newly-wed husband's past, and soon she realizes that her husband is not exactly what she thought.  To clear her tainted (and his) family name, Valeria single-handedly embarks on a job of amateur detective.<br />To fully relish the story, you have to remember several things: one of them is that the book is partly inspired by the real-life case of Madeline Smith, who, it was alleged, disposed of her lover with arsenic.  Collins made use of this well-known, sensational case, changing the sex of the accused, and he deftly challenges many concepts embedded in morally strict Victorians.  So, when Valeria appoints herself as a detective, her \\"job\\" (in Victorian society in which ladies are supposed not to work, with the possible exception of poorly-paid governess) starts to have another meaning.  Collins, on the one hand attacking the insufficient laws of Scotland, which give  its unique \\"Not-Proven\\" verdict to the accused when the jury cannot decide whether or not he/she is guilty, also challenges the morally rigid Victorian ideas about male/female concept.  This is not to say Wilkie Collins is a feminist; but considering he never married (but, it is generally agreed, had two mistresses), his unique ideas about contemporary males and females arereflected in this seemingly starange work.<br />And as a detective novel, \\"The Law and The lady\\" has still power to entertain us.  Though its beginning part is a little shaky because of implausible situations, the book gradually gets you into the thrilling adventure of Valeria, who overcomes all the barriars on her way to the truth.  Though the fact that Collins' best work(s) is \\"The Moonstone\\" or \\"The Woman in White,\\" this book is enjoyable. shows some version of Victorian ideas about the roles of males and females.<br />By the way, it is argued that the first fictional female detective (including amateur) is also created by Collins in his short story \\"The Diary of Anne Rodway.\\" (1856)  This short can be found in most of the collection of his short stories.  But if you know another contender for the first female PI, let me know.	2002-04-14

The book also contains 14 pages of an interview with the author Val McDermid, which reveals concisely her writing career till now.  A short list of Val MacDermid's works is also included.<br />If \\"A Suitable Job for a Woman\\" can be proud of anything, it is absolutely the fascinating depiction of the real female detevtives' world.  It is utterly intriguing to listen to their episodes that range from a repo-man mission in Watts, LA to take back a truck, to finding out an old boyfriend for an aged, perhaps dying lady, which sounds like, the detective herself says, \\"a real Mills and Boon story.\\"  It is also surprising to know that many of them are not only married but also got children and even grandchildren, and their ways of landing on the present jobs are as various as you can imagine.  After reading these professionals' interviews, P. D. James' Cordelia Gray story does not look entirely fictional.<br />However, this book has two shortcomings.  One is that as the author didn't have any interviews with male counterparts, it is hardly possible for us to figure out to what degree these portrayed activities of them represent characteristics of \\"female\\" detectives.  Some jobs they do must be done by male detectives as well. (And it is very regrettable that the writer didn't go further to interview these female detectives' husbands and children, whose viewpoints would have enlarged the scope of the book.)   The other problem is that though the author succeeds in describing female detectives' diversity and professionalism, their stories go almost unchecked.  It is obvious and understandable that they would not talk about their failed jobs, but the interviewer seems content just to listen to the episodes they are willing to talk about.  If I might add another drawback of the book,the voice of Val McDermid sounds sometimes hostile to male detectives (with whom she didn't interview, as I said) to champion female counterpart.  It is totally unnecessary, even damaging, considering the already impressive accounts the female detectives submit here.<br />For all the author's previous career as a journalist, it is a book written by a fiction writer.  If you're looking for P.D. James's scrupulous pen that could have revealed minutely every detalis of this unexplored world, you might be disappointed.  Readable, well-written, but as a personal journal.  This world deserves much more thorough research.	2002-03-10

Outrageous characters including an angelic heroine and impossibly theatrical villain, (too) kind-hearted gentlemen and hilarious comic relief.  <br />The story follows the fate of Little Nell, who together with his grandfather embarks on a wandering trek through England to  find her place where they can live quietly.  Around her and her old friend Kit appear the colorful characters such as incredibly cheerful, optimistic Dick Swiveller, or grotesque,  villainous Quilp (who somehow attracted a pretty lady's attention for he got married!)   On top of them, you encounter a lot of vividly described characters only Dickens can create.<br />As the novel started as a short vignette in a magazine, and then Dickens extended it, following his imagination, to boost  the readers' subscription (because the magazine's circulation dropped badly after the initial issue), the plot is very thin, and the whole work is incoherent.  The first-person narrator who opens the story disappears soon; Nell's brother Fred is gone almost silently (\\"Did Little Nell have a brother?\\" those who had read it may say.  So unmemorable.); even Kit, who adores Nell deep in his heart at first, seems to forget her existence before Barbara, his love, after Nell ran away from her house.  But all these flaws must be forgotten.  Dickens wrote it without a prepared plan; he just used his creative power, and his double plot device, which is awkward, is an inevitable result.  It is like some TV sitcoms or dramas (like \\"Ally McBeal\\" or \\"X-Files\\") that keep on running for years -- you never know where it is going. <br />So read it slowly, turn your blind eye to the holes in the plot, and enjoy the characters.  One of the most favorite episodes was once the last scene of Little Nell, for whom every Victorian actually shed tears, but you might now feel differentlyabout a series of sentimental sentences.  Well, remember it was how they felt at that time.  And don't miss one very good thing about the book; it is the budding love between the most unlikely couple in the history of English literature, that of Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness, an abused little girl.  That comsenpates for the shortcomings of \\"Old Curiosity Book,\\" most gargantuan novel coming from Dickens's imaginative power.             <br />There are many editions of the book, and as far as I know, EVERYMAN \\"PAPERBACK\\" EDITION provides complete, clear-cut original illustartion.  Watching them is another joy you can have.	2002-02-27

After her rehabilitation in hospital she decided to confess what she felt during the nightmare.  In 1990, then, \\"Little Girl Lost\\" was published. <BR>Some thought, and even now may think, that the book is trying to exploit her scandal, but that is not simply true.  The book records minutely her wild days after her sudden fame, but Drew does not lose her level-headed attitudes on her past, and honestly tells what happened in her life.<br />The book's contents cover the events from her birth to her day of recovery at fourteen, and naturally considerable part is devoted to her days of decline into drinking and drug.  Drew doesn't conceal the truth about her personality, difficult relationship with her mother, many adventures resulting from her behavior, and hard days in the hospital.  Her first-hand knowledge is, however, what many teenagers would feel in their own life, and probably many teens and adults alike can relate to the honest Drew; that is the best past of the book, and Drew's harrowing personal experience must not be dismissed as a simple, usual, celebrity's gossip you will forget next day.   <br />And thanks to her wise decision, the book includes many pages recording her good days in Hollywood.  The most memorable is her memoir during the shooting of \\"ET\\" and her friendship with the director Steven Spielberg.  Her recollection is full of happy episodes, which are as touching as the film itself, and it is easy to understand that the movie means a lot to them.  She also remembers her funny tall tales she made before Spielberg at the audition for \\"ET,\\" and nervous feelings at her appearance on TV \\"Saturday Night Live\\" as a host.  Other co-workers too appear in her book (one of them is Stephen King), and it is interesting to read those pages. <br />\\"Little Girl Lost\\" consists two narratives: Drew's own voice written (or probably recorded) in the first-person narrative, and contributor Todd Golds's third-person commentary explaining the background of her life, which includes comments by people around her including Jaid, Drew's mother.  Both tell her life one after the other, so the book succeeds in not giving one-sided view on things around her.  The book is written well-balanced, and also gives a brief and comprehensive history of famous Barrymore family (of course, you knew she belongs to the legendary Barrymores?  If not, it's time.)<br />There are so many thing I want to talk, but about the rest, you buy the book and read it.  The book is readable, and her very realistic account of her wild days, I confess, is gripping and absorbing.  Some people say it is sad, and they are right.  But she made it; she survived; and after knowing how she did it, you come to like her all the more.	2002-02-23

[The following paragraph about the story includes mild spoilers.]    \\"Aurora Floyd\\" follows the history of the heroine of the same name, who has a shady past left in France.  Aurora, unrestrained morally in her youth, hides some secret, but still attractive enough to make the two heroes fall in love with her.  Without telling the nature of the secret, Aurora, strong-willed and candid, gives a clear warning to one of them, proud Talbot Bulstrode, that he may one day regret his rash action if he dares to marry her.  While he vanishes from her to marry other woman, tame and tender-hearted Lucy, the other suitor meek John Mellish succeeds in winning her heart, and he immediately marries her, not knowing her secret.  As the time goes on, however, her hidden secret emerges from the past, and finally catches up with Aurora, living now quietly in a countryside.  She must face the past, but how?  While she is tormented by the sense of guilt, her husband began to suspect something wicked is going on.    The story is melodramatic, but it is the merit of sensation novels, the genre in vogue during the 1860s, and Braddon, as she showed in her previous (actually written almost at the same time) \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" is very good at handling the subject.  It is notable, however, that the author intends to do something different this time, spending more pages on the analysis of the psychology of the characters.  The result is a mixed bag; sometimes she shows good descriptions of characters with a witty touch, which reminds us of Thackeray, the story sometimes gets slower because of too much philosophy.  Compared with the fast-paced \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" her new experiment may look somewhat damaging.      But as a whole, the book is agreeable, and after you finish two-thirds of the book, Braddon makes the plot speedier.  The last part includes one of the earliest examples of detective story, and a good (but short) portrayal of detective Joseph Grimstone's work is still fascinating.  But the greatest merit of the book is its sub-text dealing with incredibly violent passion of Aurora, whose image is clearly mocking the typical angelic image of Victorian women.  One of the book's scenes, in which the heroine gives a shower of blows with her whip to her stable-man who bullied her dog, caused sensation and scandalized some critics.  The description is still impressive today.    In conclusion, \\"Aurora Floyd\\" is a fairly gripping story, even though it is not the best place to start reading her books or Victorian novels.  If you think you are familiar with those Victorian novels, or want to read one of the effect following the impact of Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre,\\" try it.       Trivia: Braddon lived long (died in 1915), and before her death, she even watched the filmed version of her own \\"Aurora Floyd.\\"  Her life story is as intriguing as a story she wrote.    [NOTE ON THE TEXT]  Oxford University Press's \\"Aurora Flyod\\" uses the later edition of the book while Broadview Press's uses an earlier edition.  The former one is considerable changed from the latter, so for the academic use you must be careful.	2002-02-16

In her life joins the narrator Madame Prantolungo, and the identical twins (both very handsome) Oscar and Nugent.  She falls in love with Oscar, and he in her, but  one secret he can never disclose to her greatly troubles him, because by doing so, he might lose her love.  In the meantime, Lucilla is given a chance to restore her sight. Then, Collins goes on; What if, with the amazing twists and turns of the story, Lucilla is led to think that Oscar's twin brother Nugent is Oscar himself?           <br />You say it is a very preposterous development (I remembered David Cronenberg film \\"Dead Ringers\\" made in 1988), and that has been the general reception of the book since the publication.  But the story keeps a good pace, and if you just suspend your disbelief for a while, you may forget the outrageous situation.  After all, it was from the pen of master of suspense.  But more important thing is behind the surface of text.<br />Oxford Classics gives very usuful introduction of Catherine Peters, author of acclaimed biography of Wilkie Collins \\"The King of Inventors,\\" and she places the book in the historical context to explain several aspects of the book.  One of the most intriguing is the fact that Collins researched thoroughly medical records of people who regained their sight after long-time blindness since childhood, and their reaction to the newly-given power of seeing.  Lucilla experiences many difficulties in identifying objects she sees, and Collins makes good use of those records.  Another aspect of the novel which Peters points out is that Collins uses blindness of \\"Poor Miss Finch\\" as a means of criticizing rigid Victorian moral codes.  As a blind girl, Lucilla is less restrained in observing the strong sense of \\"respectability.\\"  She is made a little willful, obstinate heroine, but it is clearly intentional.  With these things in mind, the book might become more entertaining, and inform you something about Vitorians.<br />As a literary work, \\"Poor Miss Finch\\" never achieves the height of \\"The Moonstone\\" and \\"The Woman in White,\\" so I recommend those two books if you haven't read them yet.  However, if you are interested in something very unique, you can try this one.<br />As Peters says in Introduction, intriguing theme of blindness  is recorded in Dr. Oliver Sacks's tale \\"To See and Not See.\\"  This tale can be found in his book \\"Anthropologist on Mars,\\" and partly became the basis of a film \\"At First Sight\\" (1999) starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino.  The film is not a masterpiece, but still gives some insight to the  topic.	2002-01-30

Its content is little more than that of a pamphlet, and is written as a \\"fantasy\\" about a motorcar driven by \\"the Avenger, the Destroyer, the Torturer of Soul,\\" in short, the Devil.  I believe it is intended as a warning against modern technology invading the British society, but I'd rather like to leave its interpretation to you.  Even the avid fans of her books feel very perplexed after reading it.  I have read many books of Corelli, but still don't know how to think about it.  Real curio.<br />Kessinger's edition is probably reproduced from an older one, which was printed in large, old letters with Severn's illusrations.

However, to appreciate the novel, you have to know beforehand several things.  But, don't worry, that is not much.  The story is narrated by an English gentleman Currthuers, who received an unexpected invitation of duck shooting from an old friend Davies.  Being tired of his neglected position in &#34;society,&#34; he accepts it to go to the North Sea only to find that he is involved in a mystery, or &#34;the riddle of the Sands.&#34;  His friend claims there's something in the air, something hiding behind the misty coast of Germany.  But how can they prove it?  As a story, &#34;The Riddle of the Sands&#34; is far from perfect.  It is full of authentic descriptions of local landscapes (the author actually cruised his yacht there), but at the same time frequent reference to the geographical data and nautical terms are a bit wearisome to readers, and moreover, the narrator often refers us to the maps in the appendix.  Those things only slow down the action of the novel, and actually the book sometimes has to go through lull.  But be patient and wait a while.  The story gets gradually faster, and as the adventure of the heroes slowly gets near to the core of the plot, the tale becomes more and more gripping.  Though characters sometimes are just more than cardboard (and especially female part is poorly done), your patience will be rewarded.  It is well-known that Sherlock Holmes in &#34;His Last Bow&#34; turns a spy for his country, and says &#34;There's an east wind coming.&#34;  The meaning of what Holmes says is clear to the comtemporary people, and Childers, a politician, also wrote his book not just  as a thriller but as a warning to England about the coming threat of Germany, and actually &#34;The Riddles of the Sands&#34; was written about 10 years before WW1 began.  In this historical context too, the book is interesting, and the tediousness of the opening chapters is justified if youkeep it in mind that it is meant for Childers's sarcasm against indifference and complacency among the English people (talking of English complacency, we remember later in 1938, immediately before WW2, Alfred Hitchcock again uses it as a satire in his thriller &#34;The Lady Vanishes&#34; with brilliantly silly two British gentlemen who are more concerned with cricket games than surrounding danger).  People don't change.  So, the book itself is enjoyable, but these historical matters will make it more precious; after all, it is one of the proof how people reacted to the coming change in the history of mankind.  And if you're interested in this kind of book (I mean, books reflects German-England relationship), check out &#34;The Battel of Dorking&#34; by George Chesney (written in 1871) and &#34;When William Came&#34; (in 1913) by Saki once.	2002-01-20

He somehow returns home, only to find that his wife has been  unfaithful to him, having an affair with his best friend (!!).  Using disguise, he comes back to take a revenge on them.

But what is facinating about Altick's book is not the description of those cases themselve; it is the proceedings of the trials and the reaction of the excited press that Altick skillfully traces with detailed records and footnotes, and he never lets his readers bored all through the book.  The cases themselves may not be as interesting as many other stories you might have heard -- such as William Palmer, Constance Kent, Madeline Smith, and other more notorious cases -- and some part of the both incidents are left unsolved even today, but still, the authentic look of Victorian life displayed by the pen of the author is simply gripping.  What is interesting most to me is the extraordinary development of the trial, which can be found in Dickens and Collins' novels.  In the Northumberland Street case, a mistress shows up in court to testify among the curious spectators; in French nobleman's case, the only eyewitness became suddenly unable to testify, because he happened to be fatally sick just before the trial began.  These incredible things happened in reality, and Altick relates minutely them along with the eager response on the press's (and public's) side.<br />The book is, therefore, more about the sociological analysis on the growing interest of the public in those sensational events, and Altick devotes about 130 pages of the book to it.  The remaining 25 pages are study about the trend of literature after the incidents, mainly about comtemporary popular dramas and novels.  The latter part of the book also proves how the writers (both for drama and novel) used the immediate topic of &quot;sensation&quot; before the craze of the public.  On this score, this book may help you understand some aspects of sensation novelists such as Collins and Braddon.<BR> <BR>Skillfully written, and always convincing, &quot;Deadly Encounters&quot; will be an amusing reading experience for anyone interested in Victorian period.  It's not only about crimes of passion, but also those middle-class, &quot;respectable&quot; people who avidly devoured their sordid flavor, just like us living in modern times.	2002-01-05

Though it still manages to fascinate us, you cannot deny the fact that it is dated.  Still, the book has its moment, and does not lose its power and honesty.<br />[PLOT] The story largely revolves around the two characters: Daphne and Virginia.  They both came back to Oxford after the interruption of WW1, and Daphne, good-natured but a little flamboyant, enjoys her life at her college until the appearance of Virginia, whom Daphne came to see with a deep enmity.  Together being coached by their selfish tutor Sylvester, Daphne cannot help entering into rivalry with Virginia, apparently cold, cynical, but intellectual woman.<br />Now, the book's flaw is obvious.  Characters are drawn too flat.  They are not given enough complexity to make us relate to any of them, so we cannot simply believe that Daphne can fall in love suddenly and deeply with her tutor, to devote her life to him.  Today's readers would be surprised (and even angry) to know that the heroine, who is hit (and almost killed) by her husband (who happened to have a mistress), can not only endure such humiliated position but refuses to go to divorce court (while she has hard evidence that proves his infidelity).  Instead, she forgives him and lets him go on way to be England's &quot;Minister of Arbitration.&quot;  I do not quote the convoluted logic she uses at the end of the book.  Remember, the book is, as its introduction says, &quot;an amusing period piece.&quot;<br />[BIOGRAPHICAL FACTS] More interesting side of &quot;The Dark Tide&quot; is its biographical background.  Vera Brittain, who would be forever remembered as the author of &quot;Testament of Youth,&quot; fantastic memoir about the time during WW1, wrote &quot;The Dark Tide&quot; as a virtually autobiographical story.  It is said that Virginia Dennison, a seemingly cynical student back from the war-time job of nursing, is a self-portrait of Vera Brittain herself; and Daphne Lethbridge is also considered to be a caricature (and very crude and cruel one at that) of Vera's close friend, Winifred Holtby.<br />The heroine who dominated the whole book is, strangely, Daphne.  The story vividly describes the life during her college days at Oxford, but the latter half of the book is mostly devoted to the dismal descriptions of Daphne's failed marriage.  Now suppose Daphne's portrait is based on a real-life person, abd in this case on the author's best friend.  Things get very uncomfortable, and they did.  Many people protested against the book (she wrote other caricatures), but how Holtby felt, I wish I know.  (There is a short list of suggested reading, so that may help.)<br />Perhaps we should read &quot;The Dark Tide&quot; without any historical knowledge.  However, as a novel per se, it is deeply flawed though it is very readable even today.  Reading this book was a strange experiance for me; it was reading someone's personal journal, someone too vivacious, and a little careless.	2001-12-24

One clever touch is given here; his fiancee also added one feather to them, and rejected him in the face before their marriage.  Now you think Harry must prove that he does not deserve such an act.  And probably, you expect the book to draw you into the world full of adventure.  No, you're wrong.<br />There are certainly descriptions of adventure under the sizzling sun of Africa, but you must wait.  Before they come, we are introduced to the complex relationship between Harry and other characters that are involved in his action.  Various feelings of love, regret, courage, and suspicion, all caused as aftermath of the crucial action of sending white feathers, follow with a surprisingly and deeply psychological insight.  Though the story is, as you expect, very melodramatic and sentimental, the characters are well-drawn and convincing, and if not as insightful as Henry James, surely deserves much serious attention.<br />The adventure scenes come in the last third of the book, but the suspense is a little diminished due to the rather hasty ending of the book.  (If you want to read a book full of adventure in Africa, I recommend P. C. Wren's &quot;Beau Geste,&quot; which I found a gripping tale, too.)  Still, the descriptions of the House of Stone, concentration camp of POW, (where the author himself visited after the war ended) are still realistic and shocking, and will haunt your mind after reading, and as an adeventure story too, you won't be disappointed. In short, &quot;Four Feathers&quot; is one of the greatest forgotten bestsellers in the English literature.	2001-12-14

Every reader will be drawn into the honest and readable writing style of Vera Brittain, who remembers the time of WWI when she served as a war-time nurse. As many other reviewers say, her momoir is simply stunning and even shocking in its description of her experiences during the tribulations. Though the some descriptions about the hot, (or chilling) dirty hospitals, wailing patients, or stupid supervisers are understandably subdued, her feelings reacting to these surroundings are always touching, and sometimes even with some witty remarks.    On top of that, I was impressed with her daily way of life, which expeienced the rigid Victoraimism before the comrapatively free, modern post-war era.  Some episodes are remarkable in telling us how a young woman had to live in a provincial town in England at the turn of the 19th century, when a die-hard Victorian conservative moral codes were still prevalent.  In fact, Vera, rather humourously, recounts how travelling alone by train could be inappropriate for a lady at that time, and how she had to arrange the meeting with her love, Roland, using some skills.      Moreover, some readers may find this book interesting in different way; that is, as this book was written during the time between WW1 and WW2, you get a strange feelings that something is missing from the book that should have been there.  For example, Hilter is mentioned only once, but not the Nazi, and the word fascism appears, but very briefly (though she records one episode in Italy which predicts the future events). And the League of Nations, for which she passionately devoted herself, was, as you all know, to collapse.  Considering the   book alongside with the history WE know, the book becomes all the more fascinating just because of the things the book could not tell at the time of writing.And this strange sense leaves me wondering -- \\"What did Vera Brittain do during the next world-war?\\" \\"How did she respond to WW2 and possibly other big events in the world?\\"  This is the reason I didn't give 5 star rating, because the text itself is brilliant, the book gives me little information about the author (anyway I will find it though, but...). Though a short introduction by her daughter is attached, we know little about her, and that is a shame, because this book is deserves much wider range of readers, from those who remember the war to the students of Victorianism and feminism, and her life would   interest all those readers.	2001-10-22
US	52287429	R1K7PCE1ZOJFSJ	0141180676	272664813	Pan: From Lieutenant Thomas Glahn's Papers (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)	Books	5	13	17	N	N	Bronte Meets Woolf And It Works Well	I sat up all night, reading the whole story.  This tale about a lonely, self-destructive  man in Norway, who happens to meet a young girl and  starts to love her, looks like &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; written by  Virginia Woolf.  Introspective, but not too much &quot;stream of  consciousness&quot; that might make you bored.  Basically a love  story and tradegy, it is an absorbing story; sometimes very  violent, but surely it touches the innermost recess of most  unaccountable aspects of humans' <br />heart: passion of love and hate.  Still, beware; sometimes its violence sounds like &quot;Takeshi&quot;  films and sexual nuance is always there, though much less than  DH Lawrence.	2001-07-24
