There's Dust Everywhere!: The Imperfect Woman's Guide to God's Grace	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A Breath of Fresh Air in My Dusty World	As a woman who lives in a world that strives toward perfection: the perfect weight, perfect body shape, perfect home, perfect career, perfect kids... I found Grab a Broom Lord to be a breath of fresh air.  In her usual light and humorous style, Ms. Goodman teaches us that it's not only our nature to be free from perfections, but it's the wonderful way that our Creator made us. He never intended for us to be perfect-after all, he has a staff full of angels that do just that. He made us just the way we are for a reason.<br />As with Karon's other women's studies, Grab a Broom Lord is a short read but it's packed full of powerful insights-it may be little but it's loud!  You'll learn how to overcome your need for perfection, deal with your past, live in the present, and embrace the future. But of course, without God's grace, none of this would be possible, would it?  In fact, that's the lesson that I learned from this powerful little book. In my imperfections (and do I have a lot of them), God's love and power is manifested. Isn't that an amazing gift? Don't you want to learn more ways of glorifying Him?<br />You'll find yourself as I did, reading this book over and again. Each time, you'll discover a new truth, and with God's guidance, it'll be just the thing you need at the time to adjust your attitude and embrace God's wonderful plan for you.	2003-10-29

Once I observed it in action with 33 unruly kindergarteners I was hooked!  Being fortunate enough to learn first hand from a God-fearing mother and father, our home was strict but loving, understanding but firm. So armed with a degree in education and raised by wise parents, I assumed everyone else had access to these educational tools, too. Boy was I wrong!<br />Raised in a generation of permissiveness, the parents of today have either forgotten or were never instructed in the ways of positive parenting. In a typical day filled with primal screams, tantrums, and idle threats, Mom and Dad have failed to teach junior how to follow the rules for successful living the way God intended for him to live-- with love, respect,  and obedience.<br />Several books have been written about parenting creatively, introducing the basic steps of positive parenting, but leaving the parent on her own to find creative ways to carry through with guidance and love rather than stress and anger.  With a flair for warm conversational writing, Lisa Whelchel has poured all her creative ideas (and then some) into one wonderful resource for us all--- and not a moment too soon!<br />Realizing that many parents are simply too busy to sit down and read a book cover to cover , Ms Whelchel gives us permission to flip to the index to look up hot topics in the Toolbox. And realizing that our households are dynamic, we are encouraged to try something else or change directions if an idea doesn't work-- well said!<br />As I sat down to write this review, I glanced at the book sitting on my table with a plethora of Post-It flags sticking from every which direction, marking passages and tips that I wanted to share with you. But I honestly can't choose my favorites-- you simply must  read this book from start to finish, then read it again when the going gets tough (and it will, believe me!). Keep it by your bedside or in the kitchen or near the time-out chair for quick reference. Quote the Scriptures, implement the creative ideas, and watch your children transform before your very eyes.<br />Be sure to visit the creative correction website at [URL] to read the latest tips shared by the author and online readers.

In A VERY GOOD MARRIAGE, author Tom Mullen not only pays tribute to his wife's memory, but honors their marriage with stories of everyday living.<br /><br />As he points out, most marriages end in divorce due to unrealistic idealized expectations of marriage. But marriages can survive by remembering that it's not what happens to us but our attitude toward it that makes a difference in our lives together. By committing to shared beliefs, values, and supporting one another we can get through life's battles together.<br />If every married couple took the time to write down and share with one another A List Of Cherishing Behaviors, as outlined in Mr. Mullen's book, I believe we could change the world of marriage as we know it.<br />Sharing sound advice through common sense, Mr. Mullen encourages us provide a safe and secure home for our children by having a happy marriage-- and indeed this is truly the best gift we can give our children.	2001-11-12

From the very beginning, the author defines CHAOS to make sure the reader understands exactly what she is talking about; the rest of  the book is common-sense organizing written in a humorous style. A very  easy read.<br />If I had to choose one specific topic I liked most in CHAOS,  it would be the fact that most of our disorganized lives come from outside  sources, and this book teaches us exactly how to resolve that chaos. Put  that way, it seems very simple doesn't it?<br />Help is on the way.  Ms.  Schechter provides a Chaos Questionnaire, and gives the reader permission  to skip to problematic topics first without reading the book cover to  cover. Anytime I read this, I am relieved, because this is truly a time  saver that we all welcome.<br />Conquering Chaos at Work targets time and  paper management that we all face, reminding us that we are not alone in  our efforts to organize our workday, constantly resolving challenges that  others create.

This book tackles the challenge of organization with an approach that is inspiring and refreshing. From the very start, we are encouraged to imagine and visualize what a perfect day would be like using the reporter's  technique of: who? what? when? where? how?  What a great idea! For how  can we even begin our quest for organization and a balanced life unless we  know where we're headed and what we want when we get there?<br />Another  unique illustration for time management is to step back and reevaluate the  task on our to do list.  Break it down in steps, writing down step-by-step  instructions if need be, as if we were teaching a child how to do it. Using  this system helps us see that a big task is really made up of little ones,  and that's how we should approach it, one little step at a time. Before we  know it, the job is done.<br />Using common time management tools may seem  obvious to some, but they are often overlooked by many - we're just too  busy! Streamline repetitive tasks, creating a system or form for mail,  communications, grocery lists, and other routine jobs. Rule of thumb: if  it's done more than once a week, streamline it!  We are surrounded by  time-saving tools, so why not use them? Paper shredders, universal remote  controls, rubber stamps, paper sorters, and a kitchen timer -- all of these  inventions can save valuable time in our lives and free us to do more  important things during our day.<br />Time management and clutter control are  not separate issues in our busy lives, but intertwine and overlap. Managing  our time, honoring it, unclutters our minds and daily actions and  diminishes much of the clutter around us. By reading this book, you'll  learn how to manage both, and I think that's a wonderful time-saver!	2000-04-21

I find it very refreshing when a book gives me permission to use notes of paper rather than a planner, handle paper more than once when it crosses my desk, and allows me to actually have a desk with things on it.  Why, they  even let you have a junk drawer, or HandyDrawer for those things I just  might need someday (as long as I clean it out once in awhile).<br />The  authors of How to Be Organized in Spite of Yourself have done just that,  and help us identify ourselves within the Ten Operational Styles: Hopper,  Perfectionist Plus, Allergic to Detail, Fence Sitter, Cliff Hanger,  Everything Out, Nothing Out, Right Angler, Pack Rat, or Total Slob. And we  don't even have to fit perfectly into any one, so we can adapt our  organizing system according to several different styles.<br />Time logs are  not new to a student of organizational techniques, but the authors  encourage us to analyze our logs and identify which tasks have the most  value, could be delegated, interrupted, etc. Since most of us don't realize  where the time actually does go, this tool forces us to document where and  how we get things accomplished. Only then can we change our system and  create a new workable one.<br />Full of tips for streamlining your tasks and  working with those who have opposing operational styles from our own, this  book is very effective in helping us recognize timewasters and helps  establish new ways of saving time for the things that actually do matter at  work and home.	1999-11-15

The Family Manager's Everyday Survival Guide is not only filled with useful, practical effective  tips for managing your home, but the author's philosophy is so REAL.  She  immediately provides the reader with &quot;10 Reasons to Get  Organized&quot;, followed by &quot;10 Reasons Why You'll Never Get  Organized and Stay That Way Forever&quot; - how true to life!  So many  books on organizing and time management teach just one way of doing things,  and when this style does not match the reader's personal style, a sense of  failure is created;  but not so with Everday Survival Guide.<br />This book is  well written, easy to follow, and (dare I say it) well organized. It is a  guide, reference book, and primer all in one. Reading one of the basic  principles in organizing early in the book is a big plus for the reader:  &quot;Organization is an ongoing art, a process, not an end product.&quot;  This is exactly what organizing professionals teach their clients, and a  lesson not to be dismissed lightly. By stating this right up front, Kathy  Peel has tuned the reader in to the fact that there is nothing wrong with  them, and the quest for finding balance in their life is shared by all  women.<br />I particularly enjoyed the home management exercises, such as  looking through rooms in your home for &quot;secret&quot; storage space,  and not taking anything for granted in uncluttering your home. Using  checklists as a time-saver is a wonderful idea, avoiding being disorganized  on trips, for parties, etc.<br />I've added The Family Manager's Everyday  Survival Guide to my recommended reading list for my workshops and  teleclasses, and encourage readers to buy two copies: one for themselves,  and one for a friend. Happy organizing!	1999-08-05
