The jazzy title aside, she has a very friendly and encouraging way of telling us to be real about genetics and what we can and can't change.  For instance, she turns it to herself, saying that she will never have the slim hips of Claudia Schiffer or the long, long legs of Julia Roberts.  BUT, as she also says, we can all improve what we DO have.  We can, with consistent good nutrition and a fitness program, become our OWN best selves. <br /> <br />Why the jazzy title, then?  Well, for one thing, like it or not, celebrities sell...they grab our attention.  But there's also a more \\"noble\\" reason.  As Kathy says, while it's counterproductive to try to look just like any of these Hollywood women, we can use some of them as examples of people who make a commitment to health and fitness and fit this into very busy lives. <br /> <br />Also, there are stories of improvement that can be inspiring.  Claudia Schiffer who went from being barely able to do one push-up to doing three sets of fifteen.  Jennifer Anniston, whom Kathy says she considers \\"a perfect example of how you can change your body with regular exercise and a healthy diet.\\"  But she makes the note that \\"she wouldn't have been successful if she had altered her habits for a few weeks or months, then stopped.\\"  All through the book, you get the message that these are real women, just like us, with the exception that they're famous...and if they can improve, so can we. <br /> <br />I just checked this out of my library two days ago, so I haven't actually done any of the exercises yet...I'm planning to follow the plan this week.  But based on my experience with Kathy's \\"Workout Class\\" video, I have no doubt that they'll be both challenging and effective! <br /> <br />I do plan to buy this book because I really appreciate the combination of Kathy's sensible, realistic way of looking at things, her friendly and encouraging way of expressing herself and her obvious skill as a trainer.	2005-04-04

I have read it from cover to cover and am one week into the three-week plan. Here's what I think are the best things about this book. <br />  <br /> As usual, Denise's can-do attitude permeates the text. She is upbeat and encouraging in her writing. <br />  <br /> This is a book written for busy people. Denise recognizes that many people have a legitimate struggle to fit an hour of exercise into most days and she offers here a pragmatic alternative to that. <br />  <br /> Toning exercises with the stability ball & resistance band take up twelve minutes a day, six days a week. <br />  <br /> Denise offers five cardio options, from twelve minutes three to four times a week to sixty minutes three to four times a week. Which one you pick is dependent on your goals. (Sixty minutes is for serious athletes who can invest that amount of time; twelve minutes is for people who want to see results from a minimum investment of time.) <br />  <br /> I've found what's working for me is to do the twelve minutes of toning in the morning before anyone else gets up and then we take a walk in the evening after supper as a family. <br />  <br /> As far as the toning exercises, they're great! I've worked with a stability ball before, but I've never worked with the ball & resistance band together. You can really feel your entire body working. Of course, it's too early for me to SEE results, but I do already feel like I'm walking and sitting &quot;taller&quot; and it's only been a week. <br />  <br /> One tip: The exercises in the three-week program are different every day, so you're not going to be learning a routine and then repeating it. Therefore, in order for my actual toning session to last twelve minutes, I read the exercise instructions for the next morning at night before I go to bed. That keeps to a minimum my having to flip back and forth between the day's exercise program and the detailed instructions. <br />  <br /> There is achapter explaining how to put together a program using the exercises in the book, so once you finish the three-week program Denise gives, you're by no means limited to that.  <br />  <br /> One other terrific thing: For thirty dollars I bought a stability ball and a resistance band, so it wasn't a financial burden to buy the equipment. My wallet thanks you, Denise! <br />  <br /> Very much worth the price of the book.	2004-08-05

You'll learn the science behind the process; as another reviewer stated, you'll feel like you are sitting in one of the author's classes at Johnson &amp; Wales University.  You'll learn various dough-shaping techniques, including tips that I otherwise would never have known, like how to create surface tension so that the loaf will rise up and not just out.  Basically, you will learn everything you need to know to create really great bread and you'll learn it in an engaging, easy-to-read manner from a person who obviously has a real (and contagious) love for good food.<br />You may find as I did that to begin with you will have to do a lot of flipping back and forth in the book, to review particular processes.  However, once you learn how to shape a baguette or how to judge the dough's gluten development, as examples, you won't have to keep going back to review that information and you'll be able to follow the recipes with more flow.<br />The Poolish Baguettes are to die for.  I often make a batch when I have company (since a good deal of the work is done the day before) and let me tell you, if you want to see people REALLY SAVOR their food, give them a warm loaf of this bread!<br />Of the other recipes I've tried so far, my other favorite is the foccacia.<br />Another reviewer felt like you had to have a state-of-the-art kitchen to use this book.  I must disagree, as I felt Mr. Reinhart went out of his way to teach the user how to recreate (to a reasonable degree) the commercial baking process, including steaming the loaves to create that delectable crunchy crust.<br />If you love good bread and want to know how to achieve superior results baking it yourself, don't hesitate a moment to buy this book.	2004-07-15

In the beginning of the book, he states that most people overestimate (financially) what they can accomplish in a year and underestimate what they can accomplish over many years.  He includes graphs that illustrate this dramatically.<br />The second was the chapter on values.  This chapter had a number of exercises for each partner to complete independently.  Then, together, they can begin to draft a plan for their finances that embraces the values they each hold most closely.  If the financial plan is customized to fit the values of the particular couple, taken together, it makes all the sense in the world that it will be easier and more satisfying to LIVE with that plan and carry it out over time (without either of the partners sabotaging the plan).<br />The third is somewhat tied into the first point I mentioned.  It is a chapter called &quot;The Couples Latte Factor.&quot;  This chapter discusses &quot;small,&quot; daily expenses and how, if a couple decides to eliminate or reduce even one or two of these daily expenses and invest that money instead, it can result in a lot of money, over time.  This and most of the other chapters include real-life examples of couples whose experiences illustrate the principles being discussed.<br />I recognized the value of all of this advice right away as I was reading it, but initially felt a bit overwhelmed, thinking:  &quot;This is great, but how am I going to do it ALL?&quot;  Because I imagine that other people may have the same feelings, I will share the answer we ended up coming up with.  A little at a time.  I still haven't gotten up to investing 10% of my income in my company's 401(k), but as a couple, we ARE very near to reaching our goal of setting aside a year's worth of expenses in an emergency account and we HAVE adjusted the amount of life insurance we carry and had estate documents drafted by an attorney.  Once we do have the complete year's worth of expenses set aside, I'll change my 401(k) investment to 10%.<br />Is this the order Mr. Bach or another financial planner would advise us to do things in?  I don't know.  I DO know that doing things the way we have, gradually following more and more of his advice has GOT to be better than being paralyzed and doing nothing...which is what we would have been in danger of doing if we hadn't taken it a little at a time.<br />A book I would recommend in conjunction with this is The Laws of Money, the Lessons of Life by Suze Orman.	2004-03-10

The author was once a senior buyer for Apple Computers, among other firms, and you can see this working experience in her thorough and analytical approach to family frugality.<br />The fact that the book is called \\"Miserly\\" Moms may be slightly misleading (it initially put my husband off, which is why I mention this).  \\"Miserly\\" indicates stinginess, penuriousness, lack of generosity.  By no means is this the message contained in this book.  Rather, it shows many ways families can cut expenses in order to meet a particular goal:  that of having one parent stay home with the child(ren).<br />In fact, the author's approach is to find those areas where she can make the biggest dent in expenses in the least amount of time.  Approximately half of the book is dedicated to saving money on food, since for most families with two parents working outside the home, cutting back on food expenses offers the biggest opportunity to save a lot of money quickly.  <br />Her first principle is not to confuse frugality with depriving oneself.  The reason:  if you think you're depriving yourself, you cripple your ability to make long-term changes.  Rather, she presents frugality as a choice, made every day in many different ways, both large and small.  (Example:  Would I rather have this Starbucks coffee and muffin now or would I rather do without them, if that is what it takes to be home with my children?)  This principle is reflected throughout.<br />There's also a great chapter in this book on raising frugal children.<br />I would recommend this book in conjunction with another book called You Can Afford To Stay Home With Your Kids.  I felt the latter book was stronger in helping the reader to break down his/her particular monthly expenses and make a budget ahead of time.  Also, I felt that book included more discussion on what would-be-stay-at-home-parents can expect once home...while it's true that there are huge emotional payoffs to feeling that you're making the greatest possible contribution to bringing up your child(ren) by being home with them, nothing but nothing is all sunshine and roses.  Two funny examples these authors cite are that your children will have more opportunities to drive you bonkers once you're home with them and that if you never liked housework, you will not magically find yourself liking to scrub the toilets and you may find yourself doing it more often.<br />In my own case, I felt that these two books taken together made a GREAT partnership.  You Can Afford To Stay Home With Your Kids has more to offer families prior to making the transition from two incomes to one (in my opinion).  Miserly Moms shines in showing many, many specific ways families can reduce expenses without sacrificing quality...which of course is valuable both before and after making the transition.<br />Oh, yeah...  I bought both books about a year and a half ago.  It took about a year to lay all the groundwork, but I'm home with my two children now.  The suggestions in these books helped me to lay that foundation and now that I'm home, to be able to stay there by practicing a frugal lifestyle.	2004-02-27

The chapter on contingency plans.  Yes, it's obvious that it's a good idea to have a backup-plan in case the working parent gets laid off, there's a large unexpected expense, etc.  Nevertheless, I found it helpful to read the authors' experiences regarding such emergencies which happened in their families and to consider the various ideas and options presented.  My own contingency plan was that I worked fifteen months longer than I wanted to and progressively worked up to putting my entire paycheck in savings; by the time I quit, we had enough money set aside to pay our living expenses for an entire year, if that became necessary.<br />2.  The chapter on stay-at-home blues.  I appreciated the authors' candor in describing the pros and cons of staying home.  A humorous (but true) example they give is that you won't necessarily fall in love with cleaning the bathroom and once home, you may do it more often than you did before.  Most importantly, they're honest about the feeling of isolation that can creep up on a stay-at-home parent and how one can deal with it.<br />3.  They \\"tell it like it is\\".  As they say, unless one of the parents' incomes is completely disposable, it is going to be necessary to make some sacrifices somewhere.  Something will have to go in order to keep the family's financial boat afloat.  My family experienced this period of adjustment while saving for our emergency fund; by the time I left work, we were already used to managing on one income and it wasn't so difficult.<br />I address the chapters on the \\"cons\\" of staying home specifically because if most people pick up a book like this in the first place, it's probably because they already want to be home with their child(ren).  What they want to know is how to achieve that goal and what to expect along the way.  I found this book a terrific primer on how to get off the fast track in the smoothest possible manner.<br />The reason I recommended this book in conjunction with Miserly Moms by Jonni McCoy is that I feel the latter book presents a larger share of nuts-and-bolts information on how to reduce expenses.  Jonni McCoy once worked as a senior buyer for Apple Computers, among other firms, and you can see this real-world experience in how she analyzes and approaches the issue of frugality.	2004-02-24

Nevertheless, I honestly feel that the information contained within will help slightly overweight (or even normal-weight) women just as much as plus-sized ones; either way, in today's society, the reality or the specter of \\"excess\\" weight causes us emotional pain.  <br />Since having two children, I've struggled with a weight gain of 25 pounds.  Medically, at a size 12, I'm considered \\"overfat,\\" between normal and obese.  I've been beating myself up over my weight for a long time.  I've been on many diets (never any extreme ones) and I'd have some success until I got frustrated with the \\"slow\\" results and then would find old habits, along with the weight, creeping back.  In all honesty, ultimately I would still like to lose a bit of weight.<br />But here's the interesting thing, at least for me. In doing the exercises in the book, I slowly began to convince myself emotionally that my personal value was a thing quite apart from my weight, something I always knew intellectually, but still didn't completely believe in some corner of my mind.  And a growing appreciation for the unique person that I am got me doing things like searching out high-end consignment shops to find beautiful, well-made and flattering clothes, exercising...not with the goal of losing weight, but as a way of taking care of myself..., and eating moderately, but for pleasure (only delicious food need apply for consumption).  I had the self-respect to reject any possible diet/activity changes unless I could answer \\"yes\\" to the question \\"Am I willing to do this for the rest of my life if I never lose a pound?\\" <br />And without ever feeling like I've been \\"trying\\" to lose weight, I found my clothes getting a bit looser, got curious and discovered I've lost seven pounds, over a period of about two months.  The wonderful thing is that because I've simply been focusing on taking care of myself, on a number of different levels, the result of weight loss isn't really the point.  It's just a nice little bonus.<br />The other book I've read during this time to help me understand where the creed of thinness came from in the first place was Never Too Thin: Why Women Are at War with their Bodies by Roberta Pollack Seid, Ph.D.  There were so many passages in that book that resonated with me, particularly in the chapters that dealt with the decades of my lifespan.  It helped me to put the issue of weight into a more constructive perspective.<br />I particularly appreciated Learning Curves for encouraging women to get to know themselves, to treasure themselves and finally to take what they've applied and live, whether through quiet example or through active outreaching, as a role model for other women and young girls who haven't yet made or are just beginning their journey.	2003-08-20

It includes a recipe for making a sugar wax at home. I'm one of those people who just hates paying to have someone else wax my legs and since shaving every day is irksome and time-consuming, I was really happy to find this information. Best of all, the recipe and instructions work great. I figure I paid for the book with my first leg waxing.<br />The second chapter is the one on shaping eyebrows. I already knew how to determine where the eyebrows should begin and end, but this chapter showed how to shape what's in between. It also showed common mistakes that people make.<br />Finally, in the hair-care chapter, there were great instructions on how to blow dry hair the way they do in a salon.

Each body type has a slightly different recommendation, in order to target (with toning exercises) particular problem areas.  Denise's manner of writing is informative, friendly and encouraging.<br />What I liked best:<br />The cardio workout recommended is walking, which is nice because it can be done any time, anywhere.  There are four walking workouts per week:  an endurance walk, an interval walk, a walk with toning exercises incorporated and a combination interval/toning walk.  Every two weeks the length of the walk is increased so that if you follow the schedule you will be walking 45 minutes/walk four times a week at the end of six weeks.  There is a modified schedule for those who are quite out of shape, starting out.  The fact that there is variety in the workouts makes it more interesting and less likely to result in a fitness plateau.<br />There is a wonderful chapter on emotional eating.  Basically, Denise's suggestion is to keep a \\"hunger\\" journal...noting down what time you eat, how hungry you were (on a scale of 1 to 5) and what the surrounding circumstances were.  I have tried this myself and keep going back to it occasionally as a touchstone.  I've found this a very helpful tool as far as modifying my habits.<br />There are three eating plans along with suggestions for which would be most appropriate:  a 1,400-calorie-a-day plan, a 1,600-calorie plan and an 1,800-calorie plan.  Denise also has suggestions for modifying them.  As one example, Denise explains why some women might find it most successful to alternate between the 1,400-calorie plan and the 1,600-calorie plan.<br />The food on the included menus has lots of variety and is delicious.  I don't think anyone would feel deprived.  It's also quite flexible, making it user-friendly.  For instance, the shopping lists note which foods not to buy if you're planning to eat out on agiven day during that week.<br />Finally, following her three-times-a-day stretching routine has been one of the best things I've done for myself.  I've always stretched before and after workouts, but never throughout the day, every day.  In the past month or so, little aches and pains that I used to have by the end of a day in the office have melted away.<br />As I get older, I find myself less concerned about a number on the scale, per se, and more concerned about maintaining strength and flexibility so that as the years go by I will continue to be able to do with ease the activities I love.  I found Denise's advice in this book fit right in with my goals for a lifetime of fitness.	2003-07-23

It can be frustrating that today there is such a narrow definition of &quot;beauty&quot; and this book goes beyond that.<br />I also enjoyed the concept of labeling each body type by the artist that celebrated that shape, as opposed to fruit labels, i.e., &quot;pear&quot; or &quot;apple&quot;.  For instance, the Rubens shape is all-over voluptuous and generous.  That doesn't fit today's &quot;ideals&quot; but why shouldn't one be able to look lovely just the same?  <br />I myself felt like I was somewhere in between Modigliani (very slender above the waist and curvy below) and a Renoir (similar shape, but more solid above the waist)...it depends on my weight.  In any case, some of the same styles apply to both body shapes.<br />I can say that following the advice of empire-waist dresses and dresses with bolero jackets for the Modigliani shape has garnered me compliments, both from my husband (a spontaneous, &quot;Wow!  That looks really nice on you!&quot;) and from others.  And that feels great.	2003-04-17

Within each of these chapters are various charts suggesting trees, shrubs, perennials, etc. that offer interesting features during that season.  Some of the chapters break it down further:  for instance, the &quot;Spring&quot; chapter has different charts for early spring, mid-spring and late spring.<br />Near the beginning of the book is a wonderful section on how to put together a &quot;planting pyramid&quot; for four-season interest.  (Hint:  You don't start with annuals or even perennials, as so many beginning gardeners do.) Additional design principles and suggestions are found after the &quot;season&quot; chapters.<br />Finally, the book closes with a limited &quot;encyclopedia&quot; of four-season plants which includes some suggested cultivars, cultural details for the plants, what seasons the plant holds particular interest, etc.  This section is divided into deciduous trees, evergreen trees, deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs, perennials, etc.  <br />In all, even if you don't have time to read all of the text, which is a pleasure in and of itself...this author is a good writer...there is still a wealth of helpful information to be found in this book.	2002-09-09

It might be just a light, enjoyable read for someone who's only looking for a peek at what the world of Park Avenue parenting may be like.<br />I did not think that Mrs. X was presented as purely bad; I thought the authors did a good job inbuing her with moments of &quot;humanity&quot;.  Nor do I think that Nanny was presented as purely good; as some other reviewers pointed out, she did overindulge on the vodka at the corporate Halloween party.  So for their first effort, I think the authors did a pretty good job with their characterization.<br />That said, the character I really fell for was &quot;Grover.&quot;  (Nanny's nickname for her charge, Grayer.)  There are so many terrible things that happen to children in this world...going hungry or without clothes or medicine, growing up in war-torn countries, etc.  But somehow, it seemed equally sad to me to think of a child, even a fictional one, growing up without the love, attention and validation of his parents.  While Grayer's case was extreme, unfortunately, those children do exist and they are not the sole province of the ultra-rich.<br />I guess everyone has a different experience with a book.  For myself, it left me with a renewed determination that while I may not send my kids to school with the trendiest clothes, we don't live at the most upscale address, etc., I will not shortchange them on my time, attention and love.	2002-09-09

I felt like the book deteriorated in the last section, written by Colonel Julyan's daughter Ellie.  I did agree with one of the other reviewers that the second Mrs. de Winter was reduced to cardboard in this book.  I felt she deserved better.<br />But it was interesting to hear things told from Rebecca's viewpoint and to learn something about her childhood, how Mrs. Danvers entered her life, and so on.  The only thing is, I can't help but wonder if Rebecca in Rebecca's Tale is not just a sort of re-do of Constance in Dark Angel, by the same author.  There seemed to be so many similarities in the characters and their general outlook on life, conflicted feelings regarding their fathers (although that's enlarged on much more in Constance's book), etc.<br />The one scene I really enjoyed in the last section of the book was where Ellie meets and talks with Mrs. Danvers.  That part was wonderfully done.	2002-06-14

Most of the recipes look great.  (Although sorry...I don't think I could eat a cow's vulva under any circumstances other than extreme starvation!  Don't worry:  Most of the recipes do NOT contain such unusual ingredients!)<br />I want to be as sensitive as I can in writing the next part since I certainly recognize that everyone has their own beliefs and part of humanity is the innate right to that.  The one thing I have something of a hard time with (I've studied the Bible extensively) was the section on all those ancient goddesses and the temple prostitutes that honored them.  You'll find some very poetic references to giving and taking sexual pleasure in the Bible, but the practice of temple prostitution is roundly comdemned.  The ancient Israelites were commanded not to give their sons or daughters as temple prostitutes and not to utilize the services of temple prostitutes - no ifs, ands, or buts...though the record shows, they didn't always listen.<br />I have a warm and satisfying relationship (physical and otherwise) with my partner and I like to explore different ways that we can please each other.  But I have to admit, the various references in the book about the sacredness of the sexual act and honoring \\"the goddess\\" with sex made me so uncomfortable that I'm seriously considering returning the book.  (Maybe I took it too literally, but that doesn't change my un-comfortableness.)<br />The other thing I felt very uncomfortable about was the reference to cannabis (marijuana) as an aphrodisiac.<br />Although I liked some things about this book, I'm just not sure I feel very good about having it in my house.  But obviously not everyone else will share my background and sensitivities and based on the other reviews, they may like the book very well.	2002-05-17
US	50267329	R2WIT9NZ2BNPOC	0786866942	885974332	The Bombshell Manual of Style	Books	4	7	9	N	Y	A fun read	Well, I'll have to admit that I'm not really a &quot;bombshell&quot; and in the fullest sense of the word, I don't think I'd want to be.  It seems to me that even the most deep-down, genuine bombshell (in other words, someone whose true persona fits the general &quot;type&quot; as opposed to someone who's studied the description and is &quot;acting&quot; accordingly)would have a tough time being taken seriously in real life, even if she was an easy person to like or love...and sometimes, no doubt, be maddened by!  On the other hand, maybe she's the type of person who inspires other people to take care of her.<br />Still, it was a fun book to read, with its breezy, tongue-in-cheek style.  I think it must have been a fun book to write, too.  And even for us non-bombshells, it gives a nice reminder to kick back sometimes and just enjoy life and our femininity.	2002-05-03

I borrowed this book from my local library and followed up by purchasing a copy of my own.  My main concerns were to have a safer environment for my two young children and to housekeep in a way that's as kind to the environment as possible.  But it doesn't hurt that the recipes are both effective and smell wonderful!  I love the \\"lavender soft scrubber\\", the \\"country spice scrubber\\" and the \\"cedarwood duster aid\\".  The \\"fleas-be-gone carpet treatment\\" didn't hurt either, since I have two cats.  I highly recommend this book.  <br />For people who are also interested in making their own face and body care products, Better Basics for the Home by Annie Berthold-Bond and Rosemary Gladstar's Herbs for Natural Beauty are also wonderful.<br />One hint:  Several of the recipes use baking soda, which can leave a residue.  I've found that it rinses off very cleanly if you use a combination of water and white vinegar to rinse after cleaning.	2002-05-03

I have two young children and am very glad I bought this book.  <br />Things that impressed me:<br />1.  There's a dosage chart, based on age and weight<br />2.  She's obviously not trying to replace a family physician or holistic health care practitioner.  The suggestions given are more along the lines of caring for common childhood illnesses...colds, relieving diarrhea or constipation, mild rashes, etc...things that a parent would often care for at home, unless severe.<br />3.  The author's obvious care for people, experience and intelligence shine through on every page.	2002-05-03

(Her recipes cost pennies compared to commercial products.)  While I don't suffer from chemical sensitivities like the author does, I do have two young children whose safety concerns me and I have always tried to be environmentally conscientious.<br />The book has several sections, on subjects ranging from housekeeping, face, body and hair care, environmentally-friendly building materials, recipes for paint and stains, and hobbies and crafts.  The sections that were of the most immediate use to me were on housekeeping and skin and hair care.  As you can imagine, this book packs a LOT of information, but it's not overwhelming...easy for a lay-person to assimilate.<br />I would have loved to have had this book when my children were babies!  There's a wonderful chapter of skin-care \\"recipes\\" developed specifically for babies.  (Sorry, Johnson & Johnson.)<br />Other, similar books I enjoyed were The Naturally Clean Home by Karyn Siegel-Maier and Rosemary Gladstar's Herbs for Natural Beauty.	2002-05-03

Lots of different ideas and various styles represented.  I honestly think almost everyone would find something that appealed to them.  I thought the author's rose walk was visually stunning.  One of my other favorites was the fountain with a &quot;coating&quot; of recycled glass &quot;plastered&quot; on.  (I'd like to make that myself.)  The author does include instructions.  However, to follow the instructions, it helps if you have already had some experience working with your hands.	2002-04-25

Just when you thought poor \\"Francie\\" couldn't dig herself any deeper, she gets herself into another scrape.  That was actually my favorite section of the book.  But she does make a success of things in the end and it's certainly fun to watch how she evolves.  (There's a really funny section at the end of the book, too, with Holly Grace and her boyfriend.)	2002-04-25

By the end, I liked it well enough to first reread it and subsequently read almost all of her other books.  The characters were so human, it was easy to start feeling close to them.  <br />For instance, those of you who do NOT have model-perfect figures, have you ever had to deal with body-image insecurity?  (Lilly)  Or have you ever thought of having a makeover but didn't do it because you knew it wouldn't &quot;fix&quot; what was &quot;wrong&quot; with your life?  (Molly, at the vacation home)  Or concentrated solely on your career or something else because doing that was easier than trying to sort out emotional issues?  (Kevin)<br />By the way, for the reviewers who couldn't figure out why Molly started fantasizing she was someone else during the long-awaited love-scene with Kevin:  The book actually explains it.  If she was &quot;Molly&quot; she'd have to stop Kevin and put her clothes back on because &quot;Molly&quot; isn't self-destructive and she believes pursuing this relationship is going to end up with her being hurt.  Pretending that she was a &quot;slave girl&quot; and he was a &quot;sultan&quot; was her way of allowing herself to enjoy what was happening, not a way of dissociating!<br />My other favorite SEP book is Kiss an Angel.  I guess what both books have in common, even though the characters are very different, is how the main characters change and grow.  By the end, you're just cheering for their &quot;triumphs&quot; and so sad to see the story end.	2002-03-29

But in another sense, it's quite fresh because of its unique perspective.  (For instance, does the typical romantic heroine end up shoveling out an elephant trailer at any point in the plot?)  <br />It's fun watching Daisy learn to cope with her new setting and yes, she will capture your heart.  And it's just as fun watching Alex learn to laugh.<br />Susan Elizabeth Phillips is a master of romantic comedy.  You'll laugh through the book and sigh when it's over.

A real time- and money-saver because the colors really do work beautifully together.  It's enjoyable as well, to gain the confidence to try colors I normally wouldn't.<br />No, the photographs and the paint chips will not perfectly match the actual color on your wall.  However, be assured that you will have colors that visually flow together...nothing jarring, nothing clashing.  For anyone who has painted the same room three times within as many weeks (as I have) because each time a color wasn't quite right, you will appreciate this book!<br />I myself did not mind that there were mostly illustrations of the color &quot;recipes&quot; as opposed to all photographs.  Your room isn't going to look exactly like the photographs anyway...	2001-11-01

I have to disagree with the reviewer who described the main character, Virginia, as someone who was evidently content to let her life be dictated to her. She was not content, and this is described more than once in the book, through flashbacks. She was simply a person who had been dominated by a controlling mother her entire life and never learned to take control of a situtation herself. This book is about second chances and how she learns to be an assertive and truly alive person.  I found it a joy to read.	2001-09-25

I certainly agree that it's not quite on a par with The Shell Seekers, which is one of my favorite novels of all time.  This novel does lack some flow, but has some great, funny scenes.  My favorite is the one when George walks in and finds Selina in his house and the conversation that ensues before she tells him she thinks he may be her father.  If you're a Rosamunde Pilcher fan, (and even if you haven't &quot;met&quot; her yet) this is worth reading.	2001-09-25

If you're already slim, you can probably experience visibly increased muscle tone by following the program outlined.  That's not the case for me.<br />I have followed the program for nine weeks now and I have lost 12 pounds so far.  I have another 20-25 pounds I'd like to lose.  &quot;Perfectly Fit&quot; has been part of my overall program, not the sole provider of success.  I started with the &quot;Perfectly Fit&quot; beginner's program and I do it twice a week.  In addition, I'm following the Weight Watchers Success 1-2-3 plan and exercising aerobically three or four times a week.<br />Anyway, my experience with the book has been that it's been written in a conversational, easy-to-read style.  It includes 80 or so strength training exercises and three programs geared at beginner, intermediate or advanced.  The author encourages people to keep changing their fitness routine to avoid &quot;plateauing.&quot;  I'm not a fitness guru, but she sounds to me like she knows what she's talking about and by incorporating her suggestions into an overall weight loss program, I have been successfully working toward my fitness goals.  <br />It seems to me like there's something in this book for just about anyone.  Maybe the people who didn't find the exercises challenging enough are already extremely fit.<br />I will say again, however, that you should probably ignore the &quot;8 week&quot; part.  I'm happy with my results so far, but it's unrealistic to expect a complete fitness makeover in that time frame.  That aside, I think the book is worth the money.	2001-08-09

In addition, I've always tried to take an ecologically sound approach to landscaping in my yard by gardening organically.<br />Truth to tell, I never really thought about whether or not it's ecologically sound to plant mostly exotic plants in my yard versus native ones.  I congratulated myself that I let a meadow emerge in my back yard when I moved in.  I never gave much thought to exactly what was growing in it.  I've always believed that it is just plain wrong to collect plants from the wild...but are there times when it is not only justified but perhaps actually beneficial?  If so, when?<br />In any case, the book definitely stretched my perceptions and gave me a whole lot to think about in terms of my own typical, &quot;newly developed&quot; suburban lot.  I felt like the chapter about the author's niece, also about such a suburban lot, could have been about my own.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in gardening or ecology...and even those not currently interested could probably benefit!  Worth every penny I paid...not just an enjoyable read, but a very informative one.	2001-08-09

Ms. DeMann encourages a very natural look for everyday...how can that ever be outdated?  She teaches you how to enhance what you already have.  She has some great hair tips...for instance, &quot;washing&quot; my hair with conditioner some of the time instead of always using shampoo made a big difference to my fly-away mane.  Also, the products she lists in her &quot;favorites&quot; come from a variety of price ranges...some you can get in a drugstore, some are more exclusive.  I appreciated that she had the open-mindedness to try a lot of different products.  Not every subject is covered in depth, but then if it were, this would be several books, not just one.
