US	52427558	RWEKLDRVVRD2D	5555359225	622842279	Greek Myths	Books	4	5	8	N	N	It should be an encyclopedia	I don't doubt the knowledge of Mr. Graves on classical literature and mythology, but I feel that somewhat these works could have been put in a more organized fashion, at least for the tape listeners.  Often I heard  some letter denominations, such as &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; and  other numbers as well, not really knowing why, these features were  confusing.  This work by Robert Graves is really encyclopedic and can  really get tedious.  I enjoyed the references to the myths and their  relation to ancient migrations and historical facts.	1999-10-17

Well, the main theme is that there is a dance, namely a pattern in anger in relationships and  that usually serves to cover other hidden issues.  The book gets kind of  syrupy sometimes and that is why the 3 stars.	1999-09-19

This one, being older is not as polished and still has the point of view of a female  human.  Nevertheless, it does pinpoint some important issues in the  communications between the sexes but it too often assumes women being  submissive and innocent, and men being sullen and controlling, maybe it was  then, it is not now.	1999-09-17

I  have not read the &quot;Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot; but I am now afraid to  try in spite of the rave reviews.  This book is a repetition of age old  hindu mantras, and this not even well explained mixed with common, everyday  ideas about metaphysics.  Real pity.

Obviously, the author seemed biased from his american perspective and made many generalizations that could also be  applied to America.

The description of the panorama is very breathtaking.  In spite of all this, there were some inaccuracies that I observed in the facts and  sometimes he forgets that people had to wear their pressure suits (not too  many times though).  But well, I will pass that.  What had not been  developed much, until the very end almost where it became better was the  individual characters.  They certainly lack some human characters and thus  they seem distant and hard to identify with.  The historical, political  aspects were very good, almost as good as the scientific facts.  The  characters, the human touch of this needs to be worked better to get 5  stars.	1999-06-11

However, not being divorced myself I may not appreciate the wisdom here fully.  I believe in life long commitments and I don't believe in easy divorce.  But this is  more about life AFTER divorce, for those of you who have been through  divorce whether out of stupidity or wisdom, out of selfishness or  generosity, evil or good.  Here, you get some tips to get your life back  together. Although the casual attitude toward sex in this book may be a  reflection of its time (the eighties before AIDS and HIV).  So folks, if  you have been divorced and still feel like living this may make the rolling  Sisiphus ball more bearable for you.  I would put my own advice: Never take  marriage casually.	1999-06-02

Maybe it is  just me, while the other men are oblivious to this fact?

It had many bright spots, but many parts contain endless quotes from encyclicals and past  conciliums such as Vatican II and one in Latin.  At least for the tape  version this quoting business is not such a great idea.

The NEZ description appeared to be of a typical saint, although too detached from  social interaction to be of my liking.

An idea (like this one) may be great, but too much love for an idea results in fanaticism.  True,  emotional IQ may be a new way to measure IQ, but by no means this is the  last stand of psychology.

The thematic though is great, meaning the main point that the soul's needs need to be taken care of and that those are different than  that of the spirit.  In drawing his examples using mythology, he ends up  spending close to half of the book in the significance and importance to  take homage to these 'gods', just like in ancient Greco-Roman tradition.  I  got the impression his love for this polytheistic tradition is more than  nominal and indeed might be his new religion.  The mythology could have  served as good examples but why should we focus so much on the deeds of  ancient Greek gods? I have to admit though that some of the relationships  contained and linked to each God were interesting but some of the  conclusions I couldn't agree with, while in some parts he started to sound  like the Mars and Venus guy and we just can't go back to those ancient  times.  The last two chapters contain what I thought would be most of the  book and are pretty good, for example the treatment of art as a soul's need  and his alternative treatment of entertainment which I do agree.  This part  contributed to raise my ratings of this book from two stars to three.  By  the last two chapter I had had enough of ancient mythology.	1998-12-12

The theme (the beef of the  matter) however, was pretty much the same as many others.  The only  differing part was that he just doesn't believe we can do 'anything' with a  positive attitude, but at least we can do 'everything better that with a  negative attitude'.

However, still there is the feeling that the author does believe in these grades above the importance he gives  it.  Something about the other things he says.  It is certainly not an  attack on the school system at all.  This guy is probably more pro-school  than the average person and he seems obsessed with material success in  spite of the lip service he pays to honest people with relative success.   He probably wrote this book to fight against HIS OWN obsession with the  subject and achievement.  Well, this makes me think that indeed many of the  stuff we use to say comes from our own personal experience. Maybe...	1998-11-26

It is a welcomed fresh approach using the latest scientific facts.  One thing that gladly surprised me is that Dr. Chopra seems to understand and use well the  concepts of quantum mechanics and field theory to base his hipothesis about  the self, also borrowed heavily from hinduism.  It is a powerful blend, and  the limitless power it promises almost seems attainable.  A very nice  treaty and a break away from the crowd, although, sometimes the very same  newness of these concepts (at least for me) gave me a little, somewhat  bizarre taste of my experience of the world around me.  I think this book  is not ideal to go about in one sitting, it is very deep and better enjoyed  in spaced listenings.	1998-11-07

The  view that one has to  face the pain in life is indeed a road less traveled in this world that  sometimes overemphasizes the easy way out.  I think his definition of love  attempts to grasp the concept of it, but I am happier with the definition  given by Jesus.  Trust HIM on that rather.  It made me remember my old  lessons in catechism (the love part).  The book in all, earns a well earned  B average.	1998-11-04

Some of the ideas are ok, but really if  you were to practice these ideas literally...I would not recommend it to  anyone.  But it is good as a guideline.  Keep open for other suggestions  out there though.	1998-10-12

The other part said, &quot;do not listen while  driving a car&quot;.  Well, I listen to these tape while driving my car.	1998-10-11

It raises above the average in  that respect, even though in the field of the ideas, it is similar to the  others.  It definitely has its value listening though. I would recommend  it.	1998-10-09

I managed to get a great score in the answers.  Overall, I  would say this is an ok book, although a little predictable.	1998-10-03

The author freely speaks out what is on his mind, which is well  thought out and also heart warming.  The diatribes that go on at times  against current law and society are, far from being destructive are thought  provoking and also empowering against the forces that be, as he eloquently  blurts out the injustices that go on many a times and the ways that one can  deal with them as an individual, a citizen, and most important, a  self-respeting person.	1998-09-28

Even though some of  the facts and examples presented might not be entirely consistent, all in  all, it is a good guide and the subject has been well thought out by the  author.	1998-09-17

However, it cannot be  taken literally.  There are some aspects which are doubtful and which would  lead us to actually avoid any negative aspects of ourselves which as we are  not perfect, should learn to accept and understand rather than completely  ignore them.	1998-09-02

Some of the techniques presented are good and sensible, but they  basically present feeling guilt as always being bad.  Guilt is part of  having a conscience. Not having a conscience will lead us to hurt other  people.  Lead us to be very selfish indeed.  Unless, selfishness is what is  being sought after.	1998-08-29

I have to admit her attitude came across as soon as I opened  the first pages.  As I pounded through the unfamiliar territory things  kinda started making some sense although not completely to my liking.  I  had to research on her previous novels just to aid in my reading since she  does quite a mouthful of occurrences that are &quot;funny&quot; but to a  stranger don't really convey that sense.  I would have to interview the  author in order to get the incompleted suggestions of ideas throughout the  book, it is rather a string of facts and impressions and many times also  raw preaching (some of it is good thinking, yet I am afraid I don't like  the attitude).  This book may have some value, as a complement of other of  her books and in entertainment as I actually understood some of the jokes  and the laughable descriptions and she reflects the somewhat bland reality  of the average person.	1998-08-26

Apart from the obvious claims of truthfulness of this story, it has  a particular literary charm.  The descriptions are very vivid and the ideas  very profound and much to my liking.   As for this being true, he gives us  room to ponder and alternatives as well.  Surely, he does not pick all  alternatives and surely he is human enough to admit that he might be  mistaken.  I believe there is room for much consideration just like he says  that blind denial is as bad as blind belief.  Very compelling book, and  worth a read although some stages of the book border a little on paranoia.   But definitely worth it.	1998-08-26
