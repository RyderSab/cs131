US	29657350	R2B86EMED9PQGH	0345424719	685444613	A Widow for One Year	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Excellent	It is the summer of 1958, and 16 year old Eddie O'Hare takes a job as writer's assistant with the womanizing and calculating author Ted Cole. Ted's wife Marion, is deeply grieving the tragic death of her teenage sons, and is emotionally unavailable to both her husband and her 4 year old daughter Ruth. Eddie is cast adrift intot this complex household, and begins a passionate love affair with Marion. He unwittingly becomes a pawn in her abandonment of her family. <br />Fast forward 35 years, and Eddie meets Ruth, who has become a writer herself, and who is searching for clues about her mother, whom she hasn't seen since that fateful summer. The story is told in Irving's cynical voice, and abounds with stock characters who only help to make the protagonists more real. From the first few moments of reading about Ted, Marion, Ruth and Eddie, the reader begins to care about what happens to them. Irving takes us deep into the novel, and does not disappoint.	2004-12-05

Having said that I also want to mention that I can never read two of her books in a row. She leaves me seriously disturbed and gets under my skin the way no other writer can, and I need to read something cheerful and light once I've turned the last page of one of her novels. <br /> <br />The plot of this particular novel is gruesome and wholly engaging. We meet Dr. Fiona Cameron a geographic profiler (which by the way really works, we use it in my line of work) and her partner Kit who happens to be a crime writer. There are dual plots happening, and the story takes off and gains momentum right from the beginning. Crime writers are killed off using the methods their serial killers used in the books that they wrote. McDemid pulls off a basically simple plot with brilliance, and even though I felt a stab of disappointment when the killer is revealed, the overall excellence of this book is well worth it. My only question is: How can Val McDermid sleep at night??	2004-11-20

The story centers on a cast of characters all living in a newly built subdivision. All the families have lived there for the past six years and from the outside they all appear the same. Fathers work, mothers keep house and children never talk back to their parents.  <br />D-I-V-O-R-C-E is a bad word that no one dares to speak until Nora moves in with her two children minus a husband. Things begin to change for them all as Nora and her children struggle to become accpeted in the neighborhood, and we realize that nothing is ever the way it seems.	2004-11-12

The riveting story begins on a cold winter morning in 1964 and spans the lives of DI Benett and his sergeant Tommy Clough for the next 35 years. The plot quickly draws the reader in and doesn't let go until the last page. We follow the detectives as they investigate the disappearance of a young girl and bring a murder to what appears to be a successful conclusion. It's particularly interesting to meet the characters again 35 years later, when fresh evidence surfaces.   The only irritating habit that Val McDermid characters seem to have in common is one of too much drinking and smoking. Despite my growing annoyance with cigarettes on every page, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.	2004-11-12

The author narrates the life of Ellen, a southern woman growing up in horrific circumstances. It is a testimony that the human spirit is determined to succeed, that even when we are deprived of basic needs, we carry on and move forward. This book will make an impression that stays with the reader for a long time after putting the novel back on the shelf.	2004-11-12

Kim, a devout Jehovah's witness lost her life at the hands of her husband, also a member of that faith community. The story is told with courage and compassion by James Kosteliuk, her first husband and the father of the two children. While the trigger was pulled by Jeff Anderson, some blame must be laid at the doors of faith communities where religious principles come before the safety and well-being of its women and children. This book tells of a tragedy on many levels, but most importantly it reminds us of the violence that women and children continue to face in that safest of all places: their homes. Riveting and disturbing at the same time.	2004-11-12

When Gerald, a successful and lauded author dies, his daughter is left with unraveling the mystery of his and his family's life. While the characters are well developed, they are intense, selfish and flawed. Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine manages to draw the reader in, but one can't help feeling that none of the people in the story were worth getting to know.	2004-11-12

George, who is a well loved mystery writer gives us a glimpse into how her books take shape. It's always fascinating for me to find out how a writer arrived at a particular character or scene. But she does more than give us biographical snapshots of her work, she breaks writing down into manageable chunks. Ms. George gives some very hands-on advice on how to develop character and plot, and even leaves her aspiring writers-to-be with examples of \\"character maps\\". She talks about plain old discipline and allows us to see her personal struggles with her work. I recommend this book to everyone wanting to learn about the craft of writing, but also to those who would like to see their favourite characters in an Elizabeth George mystery come into being.	2004-11-12

In \\"Comfort and Joy\\" we meet Danny and Ford, two gay men who fall in love. The story is about making a relationship work, coming out to family and friends and remaining an individual while growing as a couple. The characters seem real with real emotions, and Danny and Ford remind us that love is not about being straight or gay, but about being human. The author handles the love scenes in a beautiful and sensitive manner, which makes for a very touching book.	2004-11-12

It places blame on multimedia and national apathy, rather than on individual action. While most of the authors points are well made and researched, the book covers material that has been widely available to most North Americans. Solutions are suggested, but some are not well thought out, and perpetuate other social and global concerns such as child labour in third world countries. While educational, this is not an entirely satisfying read.	2004-11-12

The story is told from heaven, by a young girl who was raped and murdered. Hm. I wasn't sure about this, as I am generally not interested in science fiction, and this seemed to come pretty close. <br />I'm glad I changed my mind. The story of the rape and murder is told with great sensitivity, without losing any of the horror. This is one of the most redeeming novels I have ever read. The aftermath of the murder is so tragic. We see the unbelievable grief and suffering of her family, and yet I was left with a firm belief in humanity. This story is a testimony that we really are strong, we really can endure, and in the end, somewhere there is true healing.	2004-10-22

I can think of many authors who have made less credible attempts at first novels and have gone on to become well read and respected novelists. <br />Who ever said protagonists had to be likeable? Both Clare and Sally were multi-dimensional characters, and that's what you want in a good book. I agree that at different times while reading this I found it difficult to like either Clare or Sally. Clare seemed self-absorbed and egotistical for much of the time, only to unexpectedly show us her softer, caring side . I frequently perceived Sally as immature, and for someone who opened a law firm for women, remarkably uninformed of women's issues such as pornography. There are many redeeming qualities in this book, the writer touches on relevant social issues with a great deal of honesty and sensitivity. I would not call this a flimsy book, so if you expected a light hearted beach novel I can see why you would feel disappointed after reading this book.	2004-10-22

The writing is discriptive and beautiful, and often more than a little funny. Although at times sequences were a little hard to follow,especially in the beginning it is well worth reading on. One of my favourite scenes in the story is the birth of Ruthie, the unwanted child. Her reluctant exit from her mother's womb is both funny and poignant. I laughed out loud at Marina the maid and Dorothy, Flora's unflappable friend. But lest it sounds like this book is only comical, I should add that it is full of life in all it's forms.	2004-10-17

It seems that from them moment of her birth to her execution she was on a collision course with disaster. After reading this book I have no desire to see \\"Monster\\". I don't feel that anymore can be said, or that it could be said better than it was done in this book. If you are interested in Aileen Wuernos' life rather than the sensationalism her crimes became, then I highly recommend this book.	2004-10-16
