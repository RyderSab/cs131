Well, here's your chance with Dave Barry's book, Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! While the cover shot may have visions of the scatological Farrelly Brothers doing the can-can in your head, you can put a lid on that: Barry's humor is irreverent, yes, but it is tidy-bowl clean.<br /><br />Although I appreciate a good laugh as much as anyone, I have a rather serious countenance. I'm the kind of person that total strangers come up to and command, \\"Smile!\\" Another oft-posed question is, \\"Why aren't you smiling?\\" Like I'm supposed to be standing in line at the Post Office or the DMV grinning like an idiot. One possible solution could be Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! This book did have me smiling a lot, chuckling, and even - lo and behold! - laughing out loud. (This gets an entirely different reaction while standing in line at the Post Office or the DMV... It has fellow line-loungers casting furtive glances at the \\"wanted\\" posters on the walls.)<br /><br />Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! is a collection of the humorist's previously published columns. Barry has been with The Miami Herald for nearly 20 years now, and his commentary has been syndicated all over the planet - in case you are wondering (as was I), he received the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1988. According to his bio, \\"Barry writes about various major issues relating to the international economy, the future of democracy, the social infrastructure and exploding toilets.\\"<br /><br />I have read several of Barry's books before, and while I prefer the ones on a theme (Dave Barry Does Japan is my personal fave), the compilations are fun too, because I'm always bound to find a little something that tickles me. The only complaint I have about these compilations, and this one in particular, are when timely themes are included. They \\"date\\" the book, and even though it's brand new, it seems old in some places (one I can recall offhand is mention of the impending Y2K problem that never materialized).<br /><br />There were quite a few bits and pieces that struck a personal chord with me. As the driver of a little sports job, I was howling with laughter at Barry's rant on SUV drivers:<br /><br />\\"...What people mainly do with Sports Utility Vehicles, as far as I can tell, is try to maneuver them in and out of parking spaces. I base this statement on my local supermarket, where many of the upscale patrons drive Chevrolet Subdivisions. I've noticed that these people often purchase just a couple of items - maybe a bottle of diet water and a two-ounce package of low-fat dried carrot shreds - which they put into the back of their Subdivisions, which have approximately the same cargo capacity, in cubic feet, as Finland... Then comes the scary part: getting out of the parking space... I drive a compact car, and on a number of occasions have found myself trapped behind a Subdivision backing directly toward me, its massive metal butt looming high over my head, making me feel like a Tokyo pedestrian looking up at Godzilla. I've tried honking my horn, but (they) can't hear me, because they're always talking on phones the size of Chiclets (The Bigger Your Car, The Smaller Your Phone, that is their motto).\\"<br /><br />And forget Mars and Venus - Barry knows guys better than Gray could ever hope to. He has a reoccurring report in his column on Stuff That Guys Do, and a couple of them are presented here in the chapters Rubber-Band Man (\\"...Guys like to do stuff. This explains both the Space Shuttle and mailbox vandalism.\\"), and Rock of Ages (\\"At some point or another, almost every guy wants an electric guitar. Electric guitars exert a strong appeal for guys, because they combine two critical elements: 1. guitar, 2. electricity.\\")<br /><br />This is the sort of book that you'll want to read passages from, aloud, to anyone within earshot whether they like it or not. Barry has something to say about everything from the government's spending habits to the climate in Florida. Even if you're not especially interested in the government's spending habits or the climate in Florida, I bet you'll get a snicker or two from Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! You really can't go wrong with this book.<br /><br />Let's just say Dave Barry is the American Standard of humorists working today. He goes to the head of the class. He's a damn sight funnier than Harry Potter. And as I mentioned previously, Barry's humor is clean: With the holidays coming up, you can safely buy this book for all the Janes and Johns on your list. (Okay, even I'm flushed with embarrassment now...). Barry has something to say about everything from the government's spending habits to the climate in Florida.

I bought the book because Larry Grobel is a great journalist and wordsmith, and I was curious to know about how he does what he does. On that count, the book is a hit.<br /><br />Where it misses is in trying to instruct. The midsection of the book covers several different types of interviews (for print, online, TV, etc.) but completely neglects covering what I consider to be some very important ground. Most celebrity interviewers, like myself, are not at the highest echelon - most of us will not get exclusive sit-down TV interviews for the Playboy Channel; will never spend weeks with Marlon Brando on his private island; or get five or six sessions with Barbra Striesand for a big magazine cover story. Grobel's been there, done that. (But it's nice to know that even Grobel has the same experience with brick-wall publicists; he doesn't necessarily have Oscar winners banging his door down all the time.)<br /><br />I have interviewed quite a few of the same big stars Grobel has - Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Halle Berry, Meryl Streep - but my experience is quite different. I usually get about five minutes at a red carpet premiere, four minutes at a TV junket, or 20 minutes at an on-the-set press conference in which I must compete with other reporters for answers. It's rather appalling that Grobel does not even mention press junkets, red carpet premieres, or set visits in his book - let alone e-mail interviews which are becoming more and more commonplace as the world goes online.<br /><br />Grobel has the time to make an \\"art\\" of the interview - given the limitations of the situations, what the vast majority of reporters do is a quick caricature or a sketch. Still, there is a certain excitement and spontaneity to the randomness of a red carpet premiere, or having a chat at a press junket with young up and comers who aren't so guarded around the press. As long as the interviewee can express themselves well in writing, even e-mail interviews can be cool. It's too bad that Grobel doesn't mention any of this.<br /><br />Had I been looking for tips to break into the business of interviewing celebrities, I would have been pretty disappointed in The Art of the Interview. However, if you are looking for more of a memoir and are interested in the process of what an interviewer actually does, then The Art of the Interview is highly recommended. Grobel is an excellent writer, and he does a good job of seamlessly going from point A to point B.e press.

The Darkness Below opens up on Halloween night, with an old man telling tales of terror to a handful of neighborhood children. The three kids are gathered 'round in his living room, hours after the other tikes have gone home to gobble their treats. As the old man unravels his yarn, he gets more and more excited... until finally, his heart can't take it anymore. When he dies, then is revived, he brings something back with him.<br /><br />Mental hitch-hikers is what Eide calls them. It's as good a term as any, and the premise is intriguing and intelligent. Each child is \\"chosen\\" by one of these creatures, and when the story fast-forwards to their adult lives, it is revealed that two are evil, and one is good.<br /><br />At first, it's hard to figure out whether these creatures are real, or whether they are figments of fancy. It's also hard to figure out whether they come from the other side of life, another planet, or another mental plane. At first the mystery is fun, but after while I began to feel as though I was supposed to decide for myself, as no clues were given me.<br /><br />Victoria Mayfield is the protagonist of The Darkness Below. She was the child leeched onto by the \\"good\\" mental hitch-hiker (Curalis), while her friends, Anthony Hart and Michelle Brown, were latched onto by the \\"bad\\" otherworldly parasites (Krinel and Domantrian). It is apt that the latter two creatures are vampires, greedily guiding their two human counterparts to extract the blood from anyone they can find.<br /><br />They are smart killers though, careful to cover their tracks. For years, the slayings are blamed on a London blood cult. While the story is set in the U.S., the character's jobs with an airline permit them to do some jetting about, allowing for some interesting changes in locale. Victoria, fighting on the side of good, sets out to stop her once-friends from killing anyone else.<br /><br />While it is made clear that Victoria can only visit her hitch-hiker, Curalis, in dreams, not much is shown from the POV of Michelle and Anthony. In the first part of the book, there is a great, tension-filled nail-biting scene, in which Anthony and Michelle kidnap, toy with, then subsequently kill and drain, the wrong woman (it turns out her sister is a Sensitive, who ties in with the other characters later on). Eide has a flair for horror writing but unfortunately, he doesn't showcase that talent nearly enough.<br /><br />The book flounders in some places, and seems to try to be too many things at once while focusing on the minutiae - Victoria is jobless throughout much of the book, and her search for employment does get a bit tedious at times. There is one section in the book when, bored, she goes to the movies. She decides to see Interview With The Vampire. It's certainly one of my favorite movies of all time, but by insinuating that it's a first-run film Victoria is seeing, it dates the book in 1994 for no reason. Also, Eide mentions the vampire character Gabrielle in one of the scenes, when in fact she did not appear in the movie version at all. (I know - now who's focusing on the minutiae?)<br /><br />While I definitely would have been happier with more chills and thrills, and found myself skimming through some passages, I kept finding myself wanting to see what would happen next.<br /><br />I loved the strange visions, foreboding nightmares, psychic dreams, and elements of the supernatural interwoven with the sci-fi mystery. How did the otherworldly creatures manage to escape? Who are they? How will their mission in our world change our time/space continuum? These questions are enough to keep you reading, though at times the journey is more a task than a trek. Eide has definite imagination and writing talent, but in my humble opinion, he and his readers would be well-served by a more aggressive editor.<br /><br />Staci Layne WilsonMichelle and Anthony.

The man can do anything, it seems, as he blazes trails on the page, at the movies, and in the e-book trade. In this case, he validates the audio book market by releasing Blood & Smoke exclusively on cassette (or CD).<br /><br />The collection is Virginia-slim, offering up only three stories, but they are unfiltered, full-flavor horror stories linked by the smoke-ring theme of cigarettes. Smoking is a nasty habit with severe consequences, as King's cancer-stick sucking characters soon find out.<br /><br />In the first story, \\"Lunch at the Gotham Caf&eacute;,\\" downtrodden Steve Davis decides to shuck smoking just days after his wife leaves him. King expertly equates the two kinds of addiction and withdrawal. Steve's obsessive mind is seriously tweaking by the time meets with his wife and her lawyer at a trendy Manhattan bistro, where the real horror begins. Between Steve, the maniacal maitre d' and the cleaver-clutching cook, the term \\"smoker's hack\\" takes on a whole new meaning.<br /><br />The next tale, \\"1408,\\" introduces us to Mike Enslin, bestselling author of paranormal pabulum. Mike once worked for the Village Voice and dreamed of being a Yale Younger Poet... but he's ended up a hack, writing horror. Horror that keeps him very well, but doesn't feed his soul. In 1408, he's doing research for his next book, spending the night in New York City's most haunted hotel room. The proprietor does everything he can to talk the writer out of staying in Room 1408. He recounts the grisly tales of the 12 suicides that took place in that room, and how maids over the years have been terrorized by some malevolent, unseen spirit. Mike, a newly-nonsmoking, nonbeliever who has never actually encountered any of the ghosts he's written about, is steadfast. He insists, and is given the key. The key to his own doom. This is one foul phantom, but Mike escapes with his sanity just in the nicotine - er, nick of time. Or does he?<br /><br />The final tale in this trilogy of terror is entitled, \\"In the Deathroom.\\" The deathroom is the bloodstained basement of the Ministry of Information in South America in which Fletcher, a reporter who dropped the habit long ago, is being held for questioning. His captors will use any tortuous means necessary to extract the information they want from him. His only hope lies with his final request - one last Lucky Strike.<br /><br />King is the reader, and while I worship his writing, I must say his nasal, sarcastic delivery and fake accents became a bit of a drag (particularly in \\"Deathroom\\" which was definitely the weakest in the pack). The music was also overbearing and intrusive at times. But King's stellar storytelling skills filter out any of my trivial criticisms - he throws you headlong into the blood and smoke with his horrified protagonists, and you can feel their painful withdrawal, paranoia, desperation and fear. The fliptop cigarette-box packaging is a cleverly Kool nice touch, too.<br /><br />Even if you're an audio book virgin, give in to your King habit and pick up this carton of chills and thrills that really kill.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilsonf terror is entitled, \\"In the Deathroom.\\" The deathroom is the bloodstained basement of the Ministry of Information in South America in which Fletcher, a reporter who dropped the habit long ago, is being held for questioning.

US	52465295	R26GGRJA9U2K22	0441005578	223920254	In the Shadow of the Gargoyle	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Gotta Love the Gargoyles	Gargoyles have often been harbingers of fear, fascination, and fun -- from the creepy, beclawed critters that glower down from the impressive heights of the Notre Dame cathedral, to the friendly felines in pseudo-Goth mail order catalogues with their batwings and big grins.<br /><br />In the Shadow of the Gargoyle brings us the stony sentry in all his expected guises -- fearsome, fascinating, and funny -- and a few more for good measure. This is a well rounded collection, with a least a story or three to suit everyone's taste.<br /><br />Charles L. Grant's `The Soft Sound of Wings' starts the collection off, but I found it to be one of the weakest stories of the bunch -- it's about an old widower who heads up a neighborhood watch, and... well, does the neighborhood watch group symbolize modern-day gargoyles, or are they watching for actual gargoyles? I didn't get it.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's `Gargoyle of the Heart' is interesting and engaging, despite its lack of an actual ending. That's okay -- the obsessed lover, whose heart turns as hard and lifeless as the gargoyle he sculpts, is an interesting character, so I didn't mind following him essentially nowhere.<br /><br />Katherine Kurtz's `The Gargoyle's Shadow' is a humorous, modern-day jaunt that transports the reader to \\"gargoyle powwows\\" in which the protectors of church treasures lament, \\"We used to be avenging angels. But now we don't get to kick ass like we did in the old days. The Boss has gotten a little soft on sinners...\\"<br /><br />Don D'Amassa's `Scylla and Charybdis' follows shy Kim from the age of nine into adulthood, and her two gargoyle friends, Scylla and Charybdis, who are always there for her. There to listen, there to protect. This story was engrossing and somber, and it captured a gloomy mood while maintaining an interesting, if predicable, plotline.<br /><br />Jane Yolen and Robert J. Harris, collaborators on `Studies in Stone,' present a story that is similar to `The Gargoyle's Shadow' in that it takes a light, humorous look at the gothic icons, but I enjoyed this story a lot more in its' utter daftness -- cleverly titled, this \\"study in stone\\" follows the escapades of Gryx, a Scottish rainspout gargoyle who breaks free from his ledge and goes off to study at University.<br /><br />Melanie Tem's `Hagoday' follows guilt-wracked ex-con Eric, who accidentally killed an acquaintance of his. He's haunted by gargoyles, and while the idea is interesting, I didn't think it panned out. The strange, unsatisfying ending left me feeling, well... strangely unsatisfied.<br /><br />Charles deLint's `May This Be Your Last Sorrow' takes place in Bordertown (the creation of Terri Windling and Marc Alan Arnold). Never having read any Bordertown novels (or whatever they are -- no background or explanation was given), I got absolutely nothing from this story, although it was well-written.<br /><br />Nancy Holder's `Little Dedo' was perhaps one of the most creative uses of the gargoyle in this collection, though personally, I do prefer a more traditional view. Sam and Jeannie, a married couple, go to Paris on vacation. She's more interested in Euro-Disney than she is Notre Dame, despite the fact she's pregnant with a little gargoyle... or is she? This story was engaging and appealing, even when nothing was \\"happening\\" (which was, actually, most of the time).<br /><br />Alan Rodgers's `The Gargoyle's Song' is about the siren song of an ancient stone sentry who sits upon the ledge outside a lonely woman's New York apartment. And then, she invites him in. What unravels is a slow-moving, but sweetly romantic story of love found, lost, and found again.<br /><br />Brian Lumley's `The Luststone' was listed as an excerpt. An excerpt from what, I don't know -- a novel? If so, if must have been taken from the middle of the novel, as it has no distinct beginning, middle and end. I didn't care for this one at all and don't consider it a true \\"short story\\" in keeping with the theme of the collection.<br /><br />Christa Faust and Caitlin R. Keirnan's `Found Angels' starts off with a completely dead-on description of Mann's Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood tourist scene, and the scruffy, heroin-addicted kids who live and die on the sidewalk of stars. `Found Angels' follows one of these kids, who is lucky enough to hook up with an avant-garde artist who wants to immortalize him in stone. While I could see the ending of this one coming, it didn't matter, because Faust and Keirnan made the trip so much fun.<br /><br />Jo Clayton's `The House of Sisters' began with what, for me, is the kiss of death: spelling out all the dialogue phonetically. A little bit of this goes a long way, and unfortunately Clayton didn't employ the \\"less is more\\" rule here. Added to that distraction is an almost incomprehensible plot. I read about four pages before realizing I had no idea what I had just read. I think it was something about a game between two sisters, but I wouldn't bet on it.<br /><br />Wendy Webb's `Smiling Sisters' presents a day in the life (and death) of social worker, Rebecca Stern, in Atlanta, Georgia. Webb makes the most of the dark, decadent, decaying, sultry Southern atmosphere when she describes the clinging vines, the sickly sweet scent of flowers, and the crooked old mansion that Lillian, the old woman Rebecca is sent to see, lives in. Rebecca is convinced that Lillian can't take care of herself, and should not be living alone. What Rebecca doesn't know is that Lillian doesn't live alone.<br /><br />Marc Levinthal and John Skipp's collaboration, `Now Entering Monkeyface' is one of the more creative uses of the gargoyle theme in this collection. The only science fiction story, it won me over right away with its excellent writing, sense of black humor, and fast, interesting pacing. Normally, I don't like fiction written in present tense, and I don't enjoy traditional science fiction, particularly stories set on other planets, but this one was, er... stellar.<br /><br />Lucy Taylor's `Tempters' is a fascinating foray into the seamy, insidious underneath of the gargoyle. In most of these stories, and indeed throughout history, they are portrayed as protectors. Not so with `Tempters,' the tale of an English gentleman troubled, then obsessed, by a pair of 12th century Franking gargoyles posed in lewd, lascivious postures. I had not read anything by Lucy Taylor before, but her wicked writing style has inspired me to seek out more. This one is a standout.<br /><br />Harlan Ellison's `Bleeding Stones' is more a vignette than a structured story -- here we follow gargoyles who are tired of being the protectors of the \\"Jesus people.\\" They want to fly, they want to roam... they want to kill. It all begins at St. Patrick's Cathedral, when one, then another, and then another of the sentries breaks free during mass and takes revenge on the religion that enslaved them for so many centuries. The story dissolves into a bloody, unflinching look at the carnage these winged, beclawed, befanged creatures could inflict, should they choose to.<br /><br />In the Shadow of the Gargoyle is a thought-provoking, entertaining collection overall, despite the additions of the two stories (Lumley's \\"excerpt\\" and the one set in Bordertown) that the average reader probably won't enjoy or understand. In short, it's a rockin' good time!

While the subject matter isn't necessarily my cup of napalm, I must admit that Goodfellow's descriptive, engaging writing style had me hooked from beginning to end.<br /><br />The story opens up with bullets flying in a foxhole during Desert Storm in 1991, then flash-forwards to a lonely supplies store in a ramshackle desert community in Death Valley, California, eight years later. It turns out the survivalist townies have good reason to be paranoid.<br /><br />From the beginning the story focuses on the main character/beleaguered hero, Gulf War veteran Zane Ezekiel Storch, a man whose closest friends include a melting mutant named Pop Sickle, and a cave-dwelling hermit with a penchant for taxidermy. Goodfellow then begins to flip back and forth between Zane and two other characters, terminally ill ER nurse Stella Orozco, and zealous novice FBI agent Martin Cundieffe. Each of these people must choose sides between a militia of outlaw government scientists, or the enchanting messiah who seems to hold the key to eternal life. Eventually, the paths of the three intersect, and Radiant Dawn builds to what promises to be an explosive climax.<br /><br />I truly relished Goodfellow's pull-no-punches, descriptive writing style which I found, in places, to be a cross between a less wordy Stephen King and a more coherent William Burroughs.

And you will find them all in The Big Book of Monsters. There are serial killers, ghosts, ghouls, vampires, werewolves... You name it! Although this book has a deceptively plain cover, it's got an amazing array of interior illustrations (by one of the story authors, T.M. Gray) that are wicked and whimsical at once.<br /><br />Stoker-winning author John Passarella does the insightful introduction and then without further ado we are plunged into a whole other world - the underworld. Some of my favorite stories were Colors of Murder, by T.M. Gray (a story in which a murderer can paint portraits with dead-on accuracy); The Endless Memories of Forever Burning Sins, by Steve Vernon (a freaky, frank look at Frankenstein's monster); and The Glass Cage by Jason Brannon (demons throw a hell of a dinner party).<br /><br />I think it's a great value: $10 for 10 stories, plus artwork.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson	2004-12-26

Scent of the Wolf is a paranormal gothic romantic mystery by Tracy Jones, an author I hadn't had the pleasure of reading before now. I am pleased to report that her new novel pulls out all the musty, musky stops when it comes to creating a dark, spooky and spine-chilling atmosphere - it follows a spirited heroine, Sophia, who finds that she is the inheritor of a mystical family legacy after her grandfather dies... she is descended from werewolves. (That would explain her lifelong Kibbles & Bits cravings!)<br /><br />When Sophia and her cousin, Karl, decide to dig deeper into their family's past, they travel deep inside Europe. Strange, compelling dreams beckon Sophia - it's a call of the wild, luring her to embrace her true animal nature. Will she give in to the night moon, or will her human side overcome? Life is further complicated when another benefactor is named in Grandfather's will. Peter Krieg, a dark, mysterious stranger, awakens feelings within Sophia that she never imagined, not even in her wildest dreams.<br /><br />To say much more would spoil crucial plot points, but Scent of the Wolf is a spellbinding read with so many elements of the genre blended seamlessly that you really can't pigeonhole it. It's romantic, suspenseful, dramatic, and yes... truly scary.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson	2004-11-01

Written and directed by the enigmatic Wachowski Brothers, the story follows the profound journey of Neo (Keanu Reeves). Neo is Thomas A. Anderson in the regular world; he believes he's just a hacker living in America in 1999 -- but he stumbles on to the dangerous reality that the world around him is a computer simulation called the Matrix. A freedom fighter named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) explains to him that the Matrix uses humans as fuel for his quest of total domination and that Anderson/Neo is the &quot;chosen one&quot;, born to destroy the Matrix.<br />Several books have been written on the phenomenon of the Matrix -- some on the cultural impact, some from entertainment aspect, and some on the philosophies -- but Journey To The Source: Decoding Matrix Trilogy is just a little different. The author poses and answers some very interesting questions, such as: Why does the Morpheus crew use a land line phone to get in and out of the Matrix, but use a cell phone inside the Matrix? Why did Persephone ask for a kiss, and how did Trinity's kiss bring Neo's life back? Why the Architect tell Neo that he is an anomaly of an unbalanced equation? Why does the Oracle bake cookies and offer candy to Neo? All of these things have deeper, hidden meanings and it's fascinating to find out what they are. However, this book is not for the casual reader -- I'll admit some of it was over my head.<br />Journey To The Source: Decoding Matrix Trilogy would have benefited from a good copy editor, but aside from that it's a nicely presented book and is fully illustrated with original drawings.	2004-07-15

Cleaning Out My Closet is not a history of Eminem; it's a memior of a friend of his who was privy to the inner working of his life for a few years at the height of his fame. This is not a hatchet-job -- it's an honest, gritty, and often heartwarming story of a dad, a rapper, a husband, and a friend.

You might call this a legal brief - a bit less involved than most Grisham fare, but a fun way to pass the time nonetheless. Or *do* the time... The brethren consists of three imprisoned ex-judges in a white-collar  institution who concoct an intricate blackmail scheme that preys on  wealthy, closeted gay men. Posing as &quot;Ricky,&quot; a young, lonely  homosexual in rehab, the judges turn out not to be such great judges of  character when they end up penpalling with the wrong man.<br />Then there's  breezy Congressman Aaron Lake, a political puppet shucking and jiving to  the tune of CIA Director, Teddy Maynard. Maynard is grooming Lake for the  presidency - once housed at 1600 Pennsylvania, Lake will sit back and let  Maynard's CIA run the country. Lake seems perfect: he is relatively young,  handsome, well-spoken, is malleable and squeaky clean. Or is he?<br />You see  where this is going... so did I, but it was a lot of fun listening to the  seemingly unconnected plotlines, trying to guess when the two worlds would  collide. This book is deliciously fraught with mud-slinging presidential  campaign ads, international intrigue, dirty lawyers on the take, suicide  and murder, false love letters, and money... lots and lots of money. Unlike  some of Grisham's heavier, more message-laden books (A Time To Kill, or The  Rainmaker) The Brethren is written just to entertain.<br />The reader, Frank  Muller, does an excellent job. He expertly handles playing several  characters without overdoing it; you can tell the difference between the  speakers without being distracted by a showboating acting performance.  Muller is the winner of several awards for his audio book performances, and  it's easy to tell why with this reading.<br />This is not Grisham's best work  (I loved The Runaway Jury, and The Firm), nor his weakest (I struggled  through The Testament, and The Street Lawyer). It's a steady, sturdy  pot-boiling thriller right up till the end. With all the crosses and  double-crosses, surprises and gotchas, I expected a big, blockbuster  shoot-em up climax. I was disappointed. The Brethren ends not with a bang,  but a whimper. It's downright criminal.double-crosses, surprises and gotchas, I expected a big, blockbuster  shoot-em up climax.
