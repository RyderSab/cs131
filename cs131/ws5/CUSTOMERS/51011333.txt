I've had many copies of the paperbacks over the years but this is beautiful.<br /><br />I read LotR for the first time when I was 14 and from then on I was hooked.  I read it once a year until I was in my 20's then put it aside until I began to read it aloud to my own kids.  They weren't quite the enthusiasts I was until the movies arrived.  Now they are almost as big of LotR junkies as their mom.  (I took one daughter to see it 9 times during the day when the theater was empty, center balcony seats, HUGE screen, wow, what an experience, but that's the movie and I digress...)<br /><br />I've heard that LotR and the Bible were the two most influential books of the 20th century. I believe it.  So many things I did in my life may have gotten a seed planted by something I read that Tolkien wrote.  I even bought our wedding rings, (the \\"Comfort Band\\" style) because they look just like the One Ring.  THAT impressed my kids.  Especially when I put it on top of a creme brulee and it looked just like the scene in the movie when the ring is destroyed in the mountain of fire.<br /><br />The book is so beautifully written, such rich, beautiful images, such a real country to visit, how can anyone not read LotR and not be affected profoundly?  It is a credit to Tolkien's pure writing that Peter Jackson was able to recreate scenes that were just as I had pictured them in my mind long before Jackson ever had the idea to make the movie.  Perhaps Tolkien was guiding him from that far green country....<br /><br />Buy this book for life.  It is a masterpiece, a gift to the world from Prof. Tolkien.	2005-05-15

Observations, some personal history, although this is her thoughts and experiences, it is not \\"all about her.\\"  She isn't full of herself at all.  Her experience with Lyme Disease is horrific.  And informative!  Amy Tan seems to be a very nice person and I am glad she wrote this book.  It is one that I will keep on my book shelf and re-read.	2005-05-06

And I don't really like rants that go on and on.  A good short rant, to the point, that can be interesting, but she says this book is thoughts on faith.  It's really not.  It's just her blabbing on and on and on and on. <br /> <br />She seems so proud when she writes of how she screams at her son and then apologizes!  Wow.  What a good parent!  Why doesn't she just control herself in the first place?  It's all about HER. <br /> <br />I really tried to like this book but it is offensive.  <br /> <br />A friend loaned me the book.  I gave it a good try. I began each essay and finished about half, got 1/2 way thru the rest.  <br /> <br />Her irrational hatred of Pres. Bush is strange, really on the edge.  I wonder if Lamott is still sober. There isn't a lot of humility here. <br /> <br />Her nobility almost overwhelms her, she is so wonderful.   <br /> <br />She \\"slips\\" when talking to a black friend and makes an insensitive, somewhat racist remark.  What she said was what she really means, even though she says she didn't mean it like it sounded.  It's obvious she's the superior person. Her true character shows in this book.   <br /> <br />One essay \\"this dog's life\\" is sickening.  Her dog is sick, dying, but she has a vet (a jerk in my opinion) who doesn't believe in putting animals down unless they are in pain -- even if the animal is dying -- and he gives Anne syringes of sedative for when the time comes that dog is almost dead.  The labored breathing of the dog concerns Lamott but her vet assures her the dog doesn't feel any pain.  As someone who has had many dogs, I wonder how that vet could tell by listening to the dog's breathing over the phone that the dog was not in pain!  (I couldn't help but think of Terri Schiavo.)  This is a quote of what the vet says:  \\"She's not really in distress,\\" he assured me [Lamott].  \\"This is hard work, like labor.  And she has you, Jesus, and narcotics.  We should all by so lucky.\\" <br /> <br />Excuse me, I think I'll go throw up now.	2005-05-05

The author 'fills in' what certain characters were thinking.  This is a good thing; it adds reality to the facts of what happened.  The book covers the time from the start of the fire to the ending of it, how the people reacted, and he gives a very nice chapter about fires in general, how a fire of this size behaves.  Overall, the book seems very historically accurate and brings to life how miserable an event the Great Fire of London must've been.   <br /> <br />I always thought that the Great Fire was the reason there was no longer any Plague in London, but the author gives good reason why this is probably not the case.   <br /> <br />I enjoy books about Restoration England and this was not a disappointment.	2005-04-15

I found it depressing and could not finish it.   <br /> <br />I have a problem with current popular Christianity that instructs people NOT to look within but to ask God.  But how else can we ask God but by going within ourselves?   <br /> <br />I've seen too many good people become depressed and frustrated, unable to enjoy life because they live with constantly wondering if they are doing what \\"God wants me to do.\\" <br /> <br />Relying on popular, protestant and born-again interpretations of the Bible has led many people into despair.  Everyone has heard of the man who read the verse, if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and because he'd looked upon something bad, like pornography or something like, he gouged out his eye.   <br /> <br />There are so many people that believe that what God wants for them is something opposite of what they really want.  I've heard too many people say that their circumstances aren't very happy but because of some idea they have that God wants them to stay there, they remain unfulfilled or even try to convince themselves that God wants them to suffer.  This is ridiculous.  God wants everyone to be happy and prosperous and doing good work. <br /> <br />So this book, while not bad as far as some religious teachings go along this type of Christianity, and I'm sure can do some people a lot of good, there are those who will find it superficial and limiting. <br /> <br />A much more positive book, I recommend any of Emmet Fox's works.  Here is what he wrote about finding your purpose.  It may not be a 40 day plan, but it's quicker and surer: <br /> <br />\\"An old adage says: 'God has a plan for every man, and He has one for you,' and this is absolutely correct.  Your real problem, therefore, in fact the only problem that you ever have, is to find your true place in life. Find that, and everything else will follow almost automatically.  You will be perfectly happy; and upon happiness, health will follow. You will be really prosperous.  You will have all the supply that you require to meet your needs, and this means that you will have perfect freedom; for poverty and freedom cannot go together.  ..... <br /> <br />Whoever you are, God has not made you without a definite purpose in view..... <br /> <br />But how is one to find his true place in life?  Is there any means whereby you may discover what it really is that God wishes you to do?  You may feel inclined to say:  \\"Even if it be true that God has some splendid thing that He wishes me to do, and to be, how can I possibly find out what it is?\\"  Perhaps you may even be tempted to add:  \\"....\\"How then can there bye something wonderful, beautiful, splendid awaiting me? Or, even if there were, how could I possibly get to know about it?\\"  And the answer is Divinely simple -- Already in your past life from time to time, God Himself has whispered into your heart just that very wonderful thing, whatever it is, that He is wishing you to be, and to do, and to have.  And that wonderful thing is nothing less than what is called Your Heart's Desire.  Nothing less than that.  The most secret, sacred wish that lies deep down at the bottom of your heart, the wonderful thing that you hardly dare to look or think about -- the thing that you would rather die than have anyone else know of, because it seems to be so far beyond anything that you are, or have at the present time, that you fear that you would be cruelly ridiculed -- that is just the very thing that God is wishing you to do or to be for Him.\\" <br /> <br />Now, you have to read the rest for yourself.  This is from Emmet Fox's book POWER THROUGH CONSTRUCTIVE THINKING and it is the chapter, obviously, \\"Your Heart's Desire.\\"	2005-03-15

I mean, if I can't read it in French, how do I know the translation is good?  I don't, but the writing is so beautifu I assume it has been well-translated.<br /><br />I read this book like I can eat a bag of potato chips, easily.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that Hugo didn't know when to quit.  The movie versions all end with Javert's suicide and Valjean going off to a happy life.  In the book, Cosette and Marius treat Valjean rather shabbily once they learn of his former life as a convict.  I thought them rather ungrateful little creeps.  Valjean dies and they mourn him once they know the truth of his life.  NOW they are sorry, after he's dead, when it's too late.  Couldn't they have asked him earlier instead of casting him from their lives?  Valjean dies of a broken heart, so I blame his ingrate daughter and knucklehead son-in-law.<br /><br />The story ends more satisfyingly with Javert's suicide, not with Valjean's death.  Nevertheless, it is worth reading all the way through.	2005-01-29
US	51011333	RH6DJVIJ2V32V	0679642757	584670950	The Wrong Side of Paris	Books	2	11	26	N	N	Well written but it became torture to read	There are some wonderful paragraphs in this book and some profound observations on life, such as \\"all criminals are atheists even if they don't know it,\\" and this sort of thing makes the book worthwhile, but about half way through reading it, I thought to myself, \\"I don't CARE what happens next to these people.\\" <br /> <br />It's a short book and I've read other works of Balzac that I liked, some short stories and \\"A Harlot High and Low\\", \\"Eugenie Whatever\\", I forget the title.  But I couldn't get through this book. <br /> <br />I've read Les Miserables, unabridged, twice, two different translations, so I was surprised that I just couldn't get through this because it is very short and the translation seems good, that is to say, the writing flows. <br /> <br />But the plot!  Agghhh.  It is so convoluted and twisted and the manner of telling the background through a long, long, LONG legal document was so boring it almost made me cry.   <br /> <br />Godefroid feels a failure, and he pretty much is one, so he joins a group of people who devote their lives to helping others (see the other review, I don't want to even try to relate the story again).   <br /> <br />I don't see why it had to be a case of either/or.  Godefroid seemed to think he had to (a) be a huge success or (b) renounce the world entirely. <br /> <br />Why not just get some work and live life the best he could?  So I couldn't get too enthusiastic about his decision to renounce everything after living such a high life. <br /> <br />The story is told in a series of flashbacks that go way back and way back and WAY BACK, and the names of the people are long and they are changed and shortened due to the Revolution, and changed entirely through marriage, and other ways, so I lost track of everyone.  The old woman who the story revolves around was a doormat and this quality of doormatness is elevated to pure holiness in Balzac's eyes.  I became annoyed at the woman's continous praying and hoping for the redemption of her crook of a husband.   <br /> <br />I got about half way through the book, said, That's it, forget it.  But I read the last few pages and my last comment is, \\"Oh, give me a break.\\"	2005-01-29

Had the French or the British acted in a timely manner, Hitler could have been squashed like a bug before all the destruction and loss of life.  But politics got in the way and everyone seemed afraid to call Hitler on his obvious, transparent lies and bold treaty violations.  Churchill had his number, but he was criticized strongly.  Everyone believed Hitler's lies, they closed their eyes and allowed him to grow powerful.  He bluffed everyone.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book and found it good reading.  Now I am reading Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.  I recommend The Nightmare Years as a good preface.   <br /> <br />	2004-08-16

I had a neuroma in my right foot that was getting worse. The podiatrist gave me cortisone injections that worked for about a week. Orthotics that helped, but before long, I had to put them on as soon as I stepped out of bed or I could not walk. The pain got worse. The next step was surgery. But the pain didn't just end at my foot, my entire leg hurt. A friend told me about Pain Free. I began the e-cises for the foot. In 3 days, no more orthotics. In LESS than a month, I was using the stair stepper at a gym, and walking 4 -5 miles a day. I tossed the orthotics into the trash recently, I'd kept them &quot;just in case.&quot; The only thing that hurts now is that I have to pay the podiatrist bill! The other day, my right knee were hurting, it had hurt years ago the same way. I did the knee e-cises and in less than a week, I was fine. Yes, the e-cises sometimes take time, but I'd rather get up earlier in the morning and do them than be in pain.

I read this book first and in it, found the way to begin my own search for the truth of &quot;being.&quot;  The best of it is, it isn't just theory or philosphy that seems to make sense -- it works. Fox doesn't give a distinct method of working, he says to find your own way of working.  It isn't a religion.  It isn't dogma.  When he says working, he means praying effectively.  <br />Don't you tend to think of prayer as begging a supreme being for good luck? Don't most religions seem to truly be the &quot;opiate of the masses?&quot;  Political structures, actually.<br />Try &quot;The Golden Key.&quot;  I've had so many serious problems melt into the nothingness that they really are.  As Fox says in the first page, &quot;This mystic but intensely real force can pick you up today, now, from the midst of failure, ruin, misery and despair .....and solve your problems, smooth our difficulties, cut you free from any entanglements, and place you clear, safe, and happy upon the highroad of freedom and opportunity.&quot;<br />It works.  But keep in mind, you will apply these principles and your life will change wonderfully, and you will want to tell everyone you know that they can do the same, especially when you see those you love suffering.  But most won't be interested, you'll see the most people want to hold on to their problems.  It's the old saying, when the student is ready the teacher appears.  I was ready 17 years ago and this book came into my life.  I am happy, healthy, successful beyond my wildest expectations -- really!! -- I have more to look forward to every day and life is a wonderful experience for me. <br />I have discovered that there is always more and more to discover in this wonderful universe, that there is so much more than anyone can ever dream of!  <br />I experience peace of mind more than I ever have before.  This is not to say that every day in my life is perfect, but each day is pretty darned closeto perfect!  And when I let my thinking sink to a level where negativity and bad experiences begin coming into my life, I have learned a practical method of raising my conciousness back to the level that I best experience life.<br />And this isn't a book that just helps you take on a philosphy that helps you carry your burdens, this is a practical method for dissolving negative conditions.  The things Fox offers here can be the key to a gateway that you must travel for yourself.  It's easier than you think!  It's wonderful.	2003-08-08

I would like to know what these same people are doing now that the market is down.  <br />My friend's &quot;success&quot; was very similar.  COUld've been an example in this book.  <br />My friend bought a house and that house has TRIPLED in value.  The mortgage payment was very low but, as Ric says, that house had a lot of money &quot;in the walls,&quot; and he could get a bigger return if he invested that money. Now he has a big mortgage bec. he refinaced, which was a good thing, took out some cash and invested it in a variety of ways.  Diversified.  His mortgage payments are pretty high, but not too high for the income this man has had for the past 10 years.  Now, the market is down, he seems to have lost money, well, as Ric says, hang in there and the market will go back up.  Yes, that is true.  But wil it go up ENOUGH in my friend's lifetime?  Now, my friend ws managing pretty well but then he lost his job.  Got laid off, company had some losses, they downsized.  Not too much of a problem, my friend has -- HAD -- 8 months of cash reserves.  That was 10 months ago.  He hasn't found work in his field.  He used to be able to.  He had offers from other companies.  So, he sold his vacation home, cashed in some of his investments at a big loss and he is paying his mortgage but he still hasn't gotten the job he needs to be able to make his payments in the future.  He's working but for 1/6 of what he was earning before.  Before, his story could've fit into this book.  My friend wanted to retire &quot;early&quot; - sometime in his 50's but unless some wonderful things happen, he won't.  His IRAs are down, even though he thought they were in relatively low risk investments.  <br />Remember, just because some one tells you something is a good idea, doesn't mean it's a good idea for YOU.	2003-07-24

Yes, I know, the market always goes up over the long term.  People who had money in the market before the crash of 1929, if they still had their stock would be rich today.  Right.  And they'd be over 100 years old, too.  I don't have time to wait for the market to take its time recovering.  <br />Ric said that the rules have changed since \\"your parents' day.\\"<BR>No, they have not.  Mom and Dad paid down their mortgage, invested cautiously and spent what they could afford.  They had enough to take care of themselves until they died and they even left a little for me.  I like their way.  That's what I'm doing.  They owned their home plus a vacation home, traveled a lot, had plenty for their needs and neither of them ever earned more than $25,000 a year.  <br />I wonder how many of the positive reviewers of Edelman's books are actually successful and financially secure people.  I think guys like Ric sell hopes and dreams.  I know someone who thinks Ric's books are just great, and he's lucky his wife won't let him take the equity out of the house, too!<br />I'm not trying to execute some fancy moves and get a lot of money that I havent' really earned.  That's what is appealing about so many of these financial guru types:  they encourage the average person to think that with a few easy moves, he/she can make a killing.  Let me tell you, from true experience, the rich work harder than anyone.  No, I don't mean they punch a time clock and slave for 10 hours a day, but they do work, work, work, and they work often longer hours and with more pressure than anyone who just holds a job.  The ONLY reason I am as successful as I am, and I am quite successful, is because I worked very hard and put money that I earned into real estate.  I saved and I thought about everything I did before I did it.  I asked myself was I doing this because everyone else did, or was it really a good idea?  When I was honest with myself, I made money, when I wasn't, I lost.  End of story.	2003-05-31

I've been to Paris twice (and will go again despite the recent political problems) and it was wonderful to read the history of all the places I've seen.  For example, I had no idea that the Les Halles area had been reserved as a market place since 1183.  It's still a shopping area, too.  It will make my visit next time more meaningful.<br />I recommend reading this before a trip to Paris.  It's also good to read while you're there or when you get back.  <br />I'm reading it now and marking passages to check out on my next vacation in that beautiful place.	2003-05-29

Oh, my gosh, those shags.....<BR>This isn't a book I'll keep sitting idle on my shelf, I'm sending it to my sister and she'll pass it on, too.  The laughs are worth the price!!

I'm quite successful and it's not from following Edelman's advice.  Quite the contrary.  There is very little I would do his way.  Now, if I wanted to sell advice, maybe he could give me some hints.  But this book?  What worked for some people may not work for you. Carrying a large mortgage and taking<BR>the money out to invest, use for college, buy a car, pay off credit card debt is not a good use of the equity.  You wind up buying your house all over again.  And remember, the savings on your taxes do NOT equal the interest you're going to pay on that mortgage.  Yes, Edelman will advise carrying all kinds of insurance and he will also advise refinancing and carrying a big mortgage.  Guess what!  He has his own insurance company!  He has his own mortgage company!  What a conflict of interests.  His strategies seem to have worked when the stock market was hot, but now?  No.  Oh sure, he has some good suggestions, but the rules of money are NOT different from your parents' day and if you really have what it takes to be wealthy, you wouldn't be reading his book.  HE knows how to get wealthy -- Selling books.  Now, I found the books by Suze Ordman (I know that last name is spelled wrong) to be better.  Much more realistic. It wasn't that I read her book and thought, &quot;what good ideas, I'll try this,&quot; but that I skimmed through two of her books and thought, &quot;that's just what I did.&quot;  Edelman offers a lot of unrealistic dreams.	2003-03-14

Now, it doesn't.  Nowadays, Ric makes sure he has his disclaimers underlined broadly.  Listen to his show and hear this!    <br />Oh, you say, you did listen to Ric, and you refinaced your home for 30 years and put the money in the market and lost it all?  Ric will tell you that you should've diversified more.  Lost your job and can't make that bigger payment?  Ric will tell you that you should have at least 6 months savings in the bank to cover your bills.  What if you don't get a job in that time?  Ric will tell you that you should have gotten a mortage with a payment that you could handle!  <br />So, my advice is, forget Edelman.  There are too many weak spots in his philosophy.  Too easy to make a mistake and lose all you have.<br />He gives a lot of fabricated scenarios that give a lot of people the idea that they can apply his strageties to their lives and \\"create wealth.\\"  It's like Wade Cook who choses stocks AFTER they've gone up, then uses THOSE stocks as examples, supposedly that he picked early on.  Telling the story backwards and you start thinking you can do that, too.  ANYONE can tell you that if you bought IBM in the 1950's you'd be rich now.  <br />Think about it.  How did Edelman create his own wealth?  Selling YOU books, selling YOU his ideas.  Selling YOU a mortgage through his mortgage company.  Charging YOU $300 a year to be his client.  Did Ric make his money in the stock market?  Who knows?<br />I know too many people that have LOST money following his advice!!!  <br />My advice, and I've been very successful doing things this way, (properties worth almost $1,000,000 - paid for, not mortgaged, plus I have additional assets that no one can take from me, even if I can no longer work and I'm not yet 50) --<br />Buy a home that you can afford.  Pay your mortage down asap.  If you want to invest, save your money and invest it.  If you lose it, at least you won't lose your house!  <br />(My mutual funds took a hit recently, but it was all money that I can \\"afford\\" to lose, not equity from my home!)<br />Risk little, save a lot.  Live within your means.  Avoid paying interest, (credit cards, loans).  YOu want to collect interest, not pay it.<br />Be very careful about anything that will cost you money and is supposed to be a \\"good tax break.\\"  The govt. can change the rules any time and take away that good tax break.  Then where will you be?<br />I think it was WArren Buffet who said something along the lines, don't invest any money that you can't afford to lose.  That is the best advice!  YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THE EQUITY IN YOUR HOUSE, no matter what Ric Edelmans says!<br />Don't try to get something for nothing.  That's the way to lose something and wind up with nothing.	2003-01-13

Ric's a salesman.  His bait is that anyone can be rich if they follow his advice.  I found his advice to be bad.<br />For example, he recommends minimizing the equity in your house and carry a large mortage.  That can be dangerous. Things happen!  It is better to carry a small mortgage, pay off your house, and put other money in the bank. I don't carry a large mortage, we are refinancing now for only the amount we owe, will NEVER take out as Ric calls it \\"free money\\" to spend on a car, college, etc. (This last from his radio show, not necessarily in the book.)  I receive his newsletter and sometimes I'm amazed at the irresponsible advice.  Ric advises long term care insurance but I couldn't trust any company for that long a period of time.  Better use for my money is to save it, use it IF I need it, not enrich a long term care insurance company that can change it's policy.  Everyone thinks IRAs are great, they are sacrosanct, but I don't agree. The govt. tells me when I can withdraw my money for a piddly little deduction each year? Fortunately, I did not follow any of Ric's advice (and I was a client of his until last year) and my husband and I are in our 40's and look forward to financial freedom in the next ten years by NOT following what Edelman advocates. We have a house worth about $600,000; a mortage of about $180,000.  Edelman advises cashing out, investing the money, using the big mortage for a tax break.  Oh, please.  Right now our payments are so low, if my husband lost his job, we could get jobs at Starbucks and make it.  We refinanced for 15 years recently, not 30 as Ric recommends, and in 15 years we will be able to rent the house for  $3,500-$4,500 a month, a much better return on $600,000 than any mutual fund Ric recommended to us, and we can't lose the property.  With an income of $36,000 and no mortgage (we own a vacation home that we will have paid off in 15 years, too) how much money will we need?  We both will work at what we enjoy.  RIc's way, we'll still be paying that 30 year note!  If we refinanced and took out cash, we'd have a hard time with a $3,000 + month payment.  If you want to spend lots of time managing your money, you may like Ric's approach.  If you have other things to do and want to live without money worries, I recommend \\"Master Your Budget\\" by Finnegan.  THIS book won't stroke you, and it makes you face some hard facts, but it's philosophy can lead to a better way of life.  I paid Edelman my last yearly fee, never again.	2002-12-06

Finegan doesn't give schemes, he helps you to face reality!  He cuts right to the bone.  While financial planners today advise all sorts of tax strategies, Finegan gives straight forward facts, facts that are useful for someone who wants to be secure financially.  His advice is useful at all times, not just when the stock market is strong, not just when interest rates on mortgages are low.  This book is my bible when it comes to money.

I read the book, then a year later, I made my first trip to Paris.  How Teleky described Paris was so exact, although very, and beautifully, subtle.  I felt that I knew where I was.  We stayed in the Marais district and felt I'd been there.  We walked through the district where Rosie lived, and I knew where I was.  I bought the book for my sister and she loved it, too.  I'll give it as a gift again.  I wish Richard Teleky would write more fiction.	2001-01-11

There is an element in her book that makes me think she takes things a little too personally depending on how a clerk treats her at a cosmetic counter.  And a great deal of reverse snobishness is apparent, too. Her reviews are most misleading sometimes.  Excellent products are often panned, but mediocre, almost useless preparations are given good reviews.  I think her book could turn many people away from trying products that would benefit them.  Begoun seems to believe that if it's expensive, it's probably overpriced, but my experience has been, you get what you pay for.  If you have a good, sturdy skin, a cheaper cream from the drugstore may be just as good as a more expensive one from an upscale store.  Then, her recommendations may be useful.  But in my case, I was not blessed with a &quot;good&quot; complexion and spent many years trying to find the best products for my skin.  Dermatologists helped clear my skin, but it was far from pretty. I found several lines of cosmetics that are expensive, but did things for my complexion that no other products, expensive, cheap, or prescription, could do.  But of these products, the author wrote extremely negative reviews.  Her dismissal of many products as not worth the money is misleading.  In particular, one expensive product line I use did so much for my complexion, that after one year of use, my not-so-good skin became not only clear, but radiant.  Strangers compliment me on my complexion, often telling me how lucky I am to &quot;have good genes.&quot;  My dermatolgist (I don't see him for my complexion, but to remove a mole once) told me that whatever I'm using, to continue, it's doing amazing things:  and at 48 years old, I am often taken for being in my mid 30's.  When I'm with my 26 year old son, I have been mistaken for his &quot;date.&quot;  I would love to have everyone that wants good skin to be aware of this line of products, and, dismayed at Begoun's negative remarks, I wrote to her that such negative reviews may mislead someone looking for good skin care.  She did respond, but her reply was patronizing and condenscending.  I'm glad I only borrowed her book (latest edition) from our well-stocked public library.  I wouldn't trust her word on anything, but her catalog of products may prove useful.  I can't help but feel she gets something from certain companies for positive reviews.  I wouldn't try her cosmetic line.  It is bound, in view of her philosophy, to contain the cheapest ingredients.  I think her book would benefit from opinions given by others, even if she disagreed with them.  Then, alongside her negative review of something, could be a commentary from someone who loved the products.  And vice versa.  That would give a reader a very good basis from which to make a decision about a product.  But I don't think Begoun's so interested in someone finding what works for them as she says she is.  I think her motives are much more self-serving.  I would not buy this book.  Look up what you want in the store or get it from the library.  Use your common sense when choosing cosmetics and you won't need her book.	2000-12-17

Naively, I thought ALL books called &quot;romance&quot; would be of this quality, but of course, I was disappointed!  Since then, I have read the book once during each subsequent five years of my life, most recently re-reading it at age 47.  Ms. Winsor's recreation of Restoration London is accurate and her writing style much like that of Margaret Mitchell.  It's an absorbing book, but not simplistic, not &quot;light.&quot;  It's an excellent introduction to the Restoration period. Forever Amber started my interest in this period of time and, many history books later, I can say that Winsor's depiction is accurate and complete.  I understand Ms. Winsor filled about 40 notebooks with research notes before she wrote the book.  Amber does it all!  And while she's unscrupulous, she's young, and so real, I think every woman can see herself, only in part (I hope), in Amber's psychology. The most poignant part of the story, for me, was when Amber marries Lord Radclyffe and never realizes that Radclyffe was once engaged to Amber's own mother 20 years earlier, and Radclyffe never realizes that he has married the daughter of the woman of his dreams, whom he lost during the civil wars.  When Amber tries on an old wedding dress, that was made for her mother and it fits her almost like it was made for her, I almost cried because she never knows.  Amber also never realizes she is really of the nobility and one, just one, of the reasons Bruce Carlton doesn't marry her is because he believes Amber's parents to be farmers, when actually, they were of a higher station than Carlton himself.  The irony was subtle but almost painful to me when I realized these things --(after the second reading!).  I found the scene when Buckingham pays Amber 200 pound to have sex with him, and Amber is disgusted (although we never know why) to be one of the most creepily memorable &quot;kinky sex&quot; scenes I've ever read; much more effective than if the perversions had been spelled out.  One reviewer says there was a sequel to Forever Amber.  I would love to know the title!  Although, I can't believe there could be a satisfactory sequel to this story. ...  it's too sad to say how, just couldn't be any better.  Just like when Scarlett loses Rhett.  There can't be another ending, (despite &quot;Scarlett&quot;), but I'd love to know if Winsor had more in mind for Amber.  I recommend, buy a copy of Forever Amber and enjoy!  This is NOT a romance novel!	2000-10-01
