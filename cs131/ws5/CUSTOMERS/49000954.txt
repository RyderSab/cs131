I for one found that this book does precisely that. Students will want an accessible and attractive presentation. This book is beautifully presented, nicely organized, and pedagogically presented with motivation, clear explanations, and well chosen exercises.<br /><br />While the subject has a variety of facets, physics, math, computer science, this book emphasizes the last two. In a highly interdisciplinary subject, each author (or team of authors) must make selections. In selecting what to cover, the authors had the classroom and students in mind.<br /><br /> More precisely the subject here is presented in the form of quantum gates, channels, and circuits. Yet, quantum physics and the foundations are not neglected.<br /><br /> The graphic presentation (figures and diagrams) is done in a way to aid learning, and I expect that this book will be the preferred text in courses in the subject for some time to come.<br /><br /> Advanced undergraduates will be able to follow the logical progression of subjects. Several special features in the book help: Exercises, an extensive and instructive glossary, historical insight, motivation, appendices (including key math topics, e.g., modular arithmetic and Hadamard transforms which perhaps may not be widely known), and circuit diagrams illustrating at the same time matrix factorization and the complexity of circuits.<br /><br />Contents: 1.

Lise Meitner's career also spans some of the most fascinating developments of modern physics. As it happened, this includes the beginning of the nuclear age; and it continues with the age of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy resulting from pioneering and basic research into nuclear fission, started by the two Meitner and Otto Hahn.<br /><br />  Lise Meitner was born in Vienna in 1878, and she started her career in the turbulent times of the First World War, at a time when Germany was a clear leader in physics research, in the Golden Era of physics. Yet, Lise Meitner was the first woman German scientist. When she started her studies, German universities were almost entirely closed to women; and especially so in the sciences.<br /><br /> The author Ruth Sime paints a personal and a compassionate portrait of Lise Meitner, her life and her times; and she vividly brings to life the tragic events in our modern history which shaped Lise Meitner's turbulent career. A central theme in the book is the physics community's reaction to the first use by the USA of a fission bomb over Japan in 1945, (in fact it was two nuclear bombs, one was a Uranium bomb, and the other Plutonium.)<br /><br /> In Berlin, building on a decade of research by Meintner and Otto Hahn, in 1938, the three Lise Meitner, Hahn, and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission. The Nobel Prize went to Hahn alone, and Lise Meitner has been largely forgotten. The book weaves together the individuals, their thoughts (through correspondence), their ambitions, and their flawed judgments.<br /><br /> A part of the story is the ensuing events following the discovery of fission; events that were shaped largely by others than Lise Meitner. During the Second World War, Lise Meitner was a refugee in neutral Sweden. Since she was part Jewish, she had to flee for her life; flee what became Hitler's extermination machine. The racial laws began in the Third Reich with Hitler's dismissal in 1933 of university faculty with Jewish family tree, and it progressed to what we now know as the Holocaust.<br /><br /> Many of the German scientists in the 1930ties were Jewish, or partly Jewish, and they were dismissed by Hitler in 1933, or in the years up to the war. The year before the outbreak of war in 1939 was the last chance to escape, and the entire physics community dispersed as German scientists had to flee, ---  some chose to escape. A small number went to neutral Sweden, and others who had left earlier ended up in the USA, and became leaders in the Manhattan project, the secret Los Alamos team of scientists, led by Oppenheimer, the team which built the first atomic bomb. There were some German scientists, Otto Hahn among them who didn't have to flee. They included Lise Meitner's research collaborators, Hahn, and Strassmann, plus Max von Laue, Werner Heisenberg, and of course others. Lise Meitner never married, but was close to Otto Hahn before and after the War. And at high noon, Hahn helped Meintner to escape to Niels Bohr's Copenhagen, and then to neutral Sweden when Denmark became occupied by the Third Reich.<br /><br /> Those of the German physicists who stayed behind were faced with a Faustian choice, knowing Hitler's evil regime and the diabolic potential of the nuclear bomb, what does a scientist do? Does he stay in Hitler's Germany even if he doesn't have to? The second half of the book is about how Lise Meitner and her colleagues judged the physics community's reaction to the Faustian choice it had faced during the ten years of the Third Reich, and which it still was facing during the Cold War. It includes personal correspondence. One letter from Lise Meitner to Otto Hahn touched me. In it Lise Meitner was addressing those of her colleagues who had stayed behind in Germany and had worked on nuclear physics for Hitler, at least in one form or the other. They were her friends and colleagues from youth, and yet she felt compelled to point out what seems to be striking moral flaws: When the war ended in 1945, few of Lise Meitner's former colleagues express any regrets, and appeared instead to ponder the question of why the USA beat the Germany team of scientists in building a fission bomb. What is especially touching is to observe how it pains Lise Meitner to have to spell out this fact to her friends; friends she remained close to for her entire life. And in this ambivalent relationship lies yet another Faustian choice.<br /><br />It is perhaps ironic that the theme of the Faustian choice has a prominent place in German literature, from the medieval \\"Faustus\\" tale to Goethe, Weber's Freischuetz, to Martin Luther's Protestantism, and to Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus (Mann's moral despair over his country's complacent embrace of Nazism).<br /><br />Palle Jorgnesen, September 2005.form or the other.

Hence, the name \\"fractal\\" ! Pictures in the Intro make this scale-similarity visually apparent. But it is made precise in mathematical statistics, and the book further makes the connection to the engineering of signal/image processing. That's a main point of the book!<br /><br />  Selfsimilar processes are stochastic processes that are invariant in distribution under suitable scaling of time and/or space. Fractional Brownian motion or Brownian sheets are the best known of these. They were found by Kolmogorov long ago, but made popular by Mandelbrot and Ness in 1968. We now speak of 1/f processes.  More recent use of wavelet bases in telecommunication and in stochastic integration has revived interest. Other even more recent applications include finance.<br /><br />  While the underlying idea behind all of this is quite simple, and can be traced back to Kolmogorov in the 1930ties, it is only recently, with the advent of wavelet methods, that the *computational* power has been better appreciated. The idea is analogous to that of random Fourier series: Instead of treating the Fourier coefficients as random variables, it is now wavelet coefficients that are analyzed statistically. Since wavelets have computational advantages, it is not surprising that the engineering applications abound. This little book is well written, and should be attractive both to members of the math community and to engineers.<br /><br />  Mathematicians will be pleased to note that wavelet analysis now brings *Hilbert space theoretic features* of the subject back to the fore. Amusingly, this was in fact a dominant feature which motivated both A. N. Kolmogorov and Norbert Wiener in the early days; e.g., curves in Hilbert space.<br /><br />  The author is an authority in the field, and his book brings out beautifully the highpoints of the subject. I further expect that the book will go over well in the classroom; nice summaries at the end of each chapter!  (Exercises would have helped though!) The book will help bridge mathematical analysis, probability, and engineering. Engineers may like that proofs are relegated to later in the book. Mathematicians will be pleased with having the proofs, and with the clarity of their presentation. Reviewed by Palle Jorgensen, July, 2005.beautifully the highpoints of the subject.

Yet the foundations retain their permanence, and David Deutsch's captivating writing is as fresh as ever. Despite the availability of newer books, for the layman/woman, now almost 10 years later, I would still rank this book at the top. There is a lot in the book; and yet, the ideas are presented in a clear and engaging way. The author is a pioneer, a giant in modern physics; he was and is a driving force in new discoveries in the subject. Yet he has his personal way of explaining physical reality. His view is not shared by all scientists, one should admit. However, there is agreement about the scientific conclusions. The first chapter in the book stresses *explanation*, our understanding of the reason for things. There are other views of science, e.g., instrumentalism: predicting the outcome of experiments.<br /><br />  The author's view on quantum theory is based his idea about parallel universes. While fascination, the reader should be aware that there are alternative theories for explaining quantum phenomena. An important concept in quantum theory and quantum computation is \\"decoherence\\", and it is explained (ch 9) in terms of different (parallel) universes. In ch 9 about quantum computers, it might have been only fair to mention that there are such other current views on decoherence; but this is a minor complaint.<br /><br />  Presentation: I love that each chapter concludes with a section on terminology and a summary.<br /><br />  As a subject theoretical computer science started with Alan Turing and John von Neumann in the 1940ties: Classical computation follows the model of Turing,-- strings of bits, i.e., 0s and 1s; and a mathematical model which is now called the Turing machine.<br /><br />  Instead of bits, why not two-level quantum systems, e.g., models built from electrons or photons? Such an analogues model for computation based on two-level quantum systems, and a quantum version of Turing's machine was suggested in the 1980ties by R.P. Feynman. The form it now has owes much to the author himself, David Deutsch. But it wasn't until Peter Shor's qubit-factoring algorithm in the late 1990ties (not covered in the book) that the subject really took off, and really caught the attention of the mainstream science community, and of the general public:  The 'unbreakable' codes might be breakable after all !<br /><br />  That there is a polynomial factoring algorithm, as Shor showed, shook up the encryption community, for obvious reasons, and created headlines in the news. Ideas in the quantum realm, and not part of classical thinking, include superposition of (quantum) states, the EPR paradox (1935), and (quantum) coherence. Although these concepts are at the foundation of quantum theory, they make a drastic change in our whole theoretical framework of computation: Now one passes from the familiar classical notion of bit-registers to that of qubit-registers, and the laws of quantum mechanics take over. Mathematical physicists and computer scientists must revisit the old masters: Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Dirac. In passing from logic gates to quantum gates (unitary matrices), the concept of switching-networks from traditional computer science now changes drastically. The changes introduce brand new scientific challenges, and new truly exciting opportunities. I believe that this book does justice to this, and that it is still a fascinating and thought provoking invitation to some of the most intriguing trends in modern physics.quantum version of Turing's machine was suggested in the 1980ties by R.P.

When I noticed it while browsing in the book store in an airport, I was at first worried that this would another one of these overly opinionated books, more interested in imposing a view on me the poor reader than in good writing, and in letting me make up my own mind. I started reading in the plane, and was pleased to find that the author manages to paint a captivating portrait of a group of German scientists who were faced with a Faustian choice; Fritz Haber (poison gas), Werner von Braun (rockets), Werner Heisenberg (atomic bomb), Otto Hahn (fission), Max von Laue (nuclear physics) to mention only a few. For the most part, the book reads like a novel, and with his superb writing, the author Cornwell brings the characters to life. Many of the German scientists in the 1930ties were Jewish, or partly Jewish, and they were dismissed by Hitler in 1933, or the years up to the war. Many of them emigrated, and others ended up in concentration camps. Some ( Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, Hans Bethe, and more) went to the USA, and became the core of the team, the Manhattan Project who built the first atomic bomb, the one used by the US government against Japan in 1945.<br /><br />  The bigger picture in Cornwell's book is the role of ethics in science. By weaving together the individuals, their thoughts, their ambitions, and their flawed judgments, Cornwell is not excusing anyone, but rather, he is helping us understand that we all must take responsibility for our actions. We can perhaps understand how present day scientists, and in fact all of us are faced with Faustian choices of our own.<br /><br />  I liked this one of Cornwell's books a lot better than his perhaps better known one, `Hitler's Pope'. It had me hooked from the start, and I couldn't put it down. Cornwell is not just relying on old historical sources. Since Michael Frayn's play `Copenhagen' a few years ago about the meeting in Copenhagen in the fall of 1941 between Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr, new documents have been made available from Bohr's archives which help us understand Heisenberg's motives better. Cornwell displays a remarkable judgment in making use of them<br /><br />  My reading of Heisenberg: If you accept a dinner invitation with the Devil, it is best to eat with a tea spoon. While Heisenberg, a humanist at heart may have understood this, at least initially, he soon found himself, perhaps as a result of blind ambition, eating at the trough with both hands deep into the stew, all the way up to his elbows.<br /><br />  It is perhaps ironic that the theme of the Faustian choice has a prominent place in German literature, from the medieval \\"Faustus\\" tale to Goethe, Weber's Freischuetz, to Martin Luther's Protestantism, and to Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus (Mann's moral despair over his country's complacent embrace of Nazism).<br /><br />  In fact the theme of Cornwell's novel is universal, and it is as timely now as it was 60 years ago, and even 300 years ago.

It is truly a pearl, and pearls have permanence; --  they retain their beauty, from one generation to the next.<br /><br />  So too is the case for this little book. Measured in mathematical generations, you must count back a few;--  back to the last year of the Second World War, and in what was then The Soviet Union; now Russia. The author, A. Y. Khinchin was (and is) a mathematical physicist of World Renown. He has seminal contributions to number theory, to statistics, to information theory, and to statistical physics.<br /><br />  The book is unique in many ways; for one, I believe it is for everyone, -- even if you don't know math. But readers with math background will know that it is possible for writing in math to be both moving and beautiful. This is the case for this little classic. Both the historical background and the subject are unique.<br /><br />  The nature of the book (64 pages in all!) is almost like a personal letter written by a loving teacher to one of his students, but it is much more than that.<br /><br />  At the time, the War had devastated Russia, and almost everyone from the young generation, including students of the sciences was at the front. The casualties everywhere in The Soviet Union were staggering; many had lost parents and relatives during 4 long years of destruction.<br /><br />  Khinchin's student Seryozha was recovering (at the time of the letter) in an army hospital, and he had written his former teacher, asking for math problems to work on. We can't begin to imagine the terrible conditions of army hospitals on the front at this time. The care Khinchin took in responding is moving. In fact Seryozha had only taken one or two beginning classes at university, before being sent to war. And even though Khinchin had only a vague recollection of Seryozha from a class, he truly wanted to send him something he could use, -- something that would make him happy. Students at the front were giving their lives for the rest of the country, and we must remember that this was a war where the difference between good and evil was crystal clear. Khinchin's students were heroes. The book opens with a moving and personal letter, full of empathy, gratitude and love.<br /><br />  As for the mathematics, Khinchin had carefully selected problems of great beauty, problems that can be stated and appreciated with little specialized knowledge; -- in modern lingo, with very few prerequisites. And at the same time, they are problems Seryozha can work on in his hospital bed. They are profound, and they can be attacked with elementary means. Naturally, since 1945, there have been a lot of advances on all three. The problems are from arithmetic (or number theory), and they go under the names: (a) van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions, (b) Landau's hypothesis and Mann's theorem, and (c) an elementary solution of Waring's problem.<br /><br />  By now these three problems take a different form in modern math books, but none as beautiful, in my opinion as Khinchin's in his loving letter to his student written toward the end of the war.

The geometry and dynamics of limit sets is one of the more exciting new trends in mathematics; a subject at the interface of analysis and discrete mathematics. The book is addressed to the beginning graduate level, but it will likely be useful to anyone who wishes to get a feeling for this active and new mathematical area. The examples include conformal measures, iteration of polynomial like mappings, Kleinian groups, multifractal analysis. The main topics are (by chapter) symbolic dynamics, families of functions and their conformal measures, graph and Markov systems, iterated function systems, and topics in dynamics, e.g., rigidity, parabolic systems, Hausdorff and packing measures.) Each subject is attractively presented and followed up to the level of current research.<br /><br />The presentation is clear and concise, and the book can be used in the class room, or for self study. The topics progress logically, and the book represents a coherent unity of ideas, but it can also be used by anyone who wishes to learn just one part of the material, for example conformal iterated function systems.<br /><br />Reviewed by Palle Jorgensen, March 2005.	2005-03-23

It's a delicate balance for book: Encyclopedic  vs well focused on a unifying theme!<br /><br />  Penrose succeeds admirably. It's not boring! Books like this are few and far between. Indeed, there are preciously few authors who manage to successfully guide beginning students into serious scientific topics; and even fewer who can see the big picture, and do it all. And then keeping our attention through more than 1000 pages! Penrose's book is inspiring, informative, exciting; and at the same time it's honest about what math and physics are. It is modest when modesty is called for. You are not cheated. You do get the equations (not just hand waving!), but you are gently prepared in advance, so you will want the mathematical formulae. Penrose's book is likely to help high school students getting started in science; and to inspire and inform us all. There is something for everyone: for the beginning student in math or in physics, for the educated layman/woman (perhaps the students' parents), for graduate students, for teachers, for scientists, for researchers; and the list goes on.<br /><br />It is one of the very few books of this scope that is not intimidating. Not in the least!<br /><br />  I can't begin to do justice to this terrific book. Get it, and judge for yourself. I will also not give away the ending, other than saying that the title of the book is a good hint. And you will be able to form your own take, and your own ideas on the conclusion. Like with all good and subtle endings, they can be understood and appreciated at several levels.<br /><br />  I came across Penrose's book in my bookstore by accident, and I was at first apprehensive: The more than 1000 pages, and the 3.3 pounds are enough to intimidate anyone. But when I started to read, I found myself unable to put it down. And I didn't: Bought it; and I had several days of enjoyable reading. I am not likely to put it away to collect dust either. It is the kind of book you will want to keep using, and to return to.<br /><br />  It will not surprise that one of Penrose's unifying themes is the compelling and pleasing geometric images that underlie both the mathematics (roughly one third of the book: modern geometry, Riemann surfaces, complex functions, Fourier analysis, visions of infinity), and the physics: Cosmology (the big bang, black holes), gravity, thermodynamics, relativity (classical and modern: loop quantum gravity, twisters), and quantum theory (wave-particle duality, atomic spectra, coherence, measurements).<br /><br />  The pictures: In fact, this semester, I was just teaching a graduate course, and I had a hard time presenting of Riemann surfaces in an attractive way. It's a subject that typically comes across as intimidating in many of the classical books: Take Herman Weyl's book, for example. I also found it refreshing to see that Roger Penrose gave the many illustrations his own personal and artistic touch; as opposed to having flashy pictures generated by the latest in color-graphics and special effects. I think readers will relate better to Penrose's own illustrations: They isolate and highlight the core ideas and they are not intimidating: We sense that we ourselves would have been able to make similar pencil sketches.

It has in common with Walter Rudin's book (entitled 'Real and Complex Analysis') that it covers both real functions (integration theory and more), as well as Cauchy's theorems for analytic functions. Shilov's book is at an undergraduate level, and it can easily be used for self-study. The Dover edition is affordable. Rudin's book is for the beginning graduate level, and it is widely used in math departments around the world. Both books have stood the test of time.<br /><br />Comparison of Shilov with Rudin: Rudin's 'Real and Complex' has become an institution, and I have to admit I have loved it since I was a student myself, but conventional wisdom will have it that Shilov is a lot gentler on students, and much easier to get started with: It stresses motivation a bit more, the exercises are easier (some of Rudin's exercises are notorious, but I find the challenge charming--not all of my students do though!), and finally Shilov gets to touch upon a few applications; fashionable these days. But that part easily gets dated. I will expect that beginning students will enjoy Shilov's book.<br /><br />Personally, I find that with perseverance, students who keep at it with Rudin's book, will end up with a lot stronger foundation. They are more likely to have proofs in their blood. I guess Shilov can always serve as a leisurely supplementary reading to Rudin.<br /><br />There will never be another book like Rudin's 'Real and Complex', just like there will never be another van Gogh. But the fact that we love van Gogh doesn't prevent us from enjoying other paintings.	2005-01-08

While there has been a number of recent wavelet books on the market covering a variety of aspects of this important subject of applied math; of those books only a few are good for use in a beginning course; the kind of course aimed at advanced undergraduates, and at students in related fields of math such as numerical analysis; and students from other departments, especially students from engineering departments: EE, medical imaging, and Computer and Electrical Engineering; to mention just a few.<br /><br />The present book seems especially pedagogical well designed for student needs; and the author clearly had students in mind. Rather than delving into a variety of technical issues, the book goes directly to the underlying geometric ideas that students can understand at an intuitive level; without too much background. The algorithmic steps in the subject well presented, and they are essential both for the theory, and for the applications to the analysis of number sets (data mining), of pictures, and of many other applications.<br /><br />The book is certainly more limited in scope than for example Daubechies's book that appeared in the SIAM series in 1992, but it is also gentle on students, and is likely to serve as a lovely invitation to the subject.<br /><br />When the students progress in the course, they will then build up a deeper understanding of the fundamental ideas, which in fact are quite simple when isolated from the traditional rather heavy notation and terminology. The fundamental ideas are nicely illustrated with tree diagrams which also serve as the underpinning for wavelet programs.<br /><br />An additional advantage of this little book is that students will be able to get hands-on experience with graphics, and with MATLAB routines, as they work their way through the book.<br /><br />Review by Palle Jorgensen, December 2004.	2004-12-09

I miss old fashioned letters, now that we live in the age of email. Frotunately, I still have 'real' letters saved that have now collected dust from my parent's generation, and from a time gone by.<br /><br />Occasionally I stumble over published letters of famous writers in antique bookstores: Last time, it was a 800 page volume of some of Ernest Hemingway's personal letters; the first edition of this Amazon edition. They were published posthumeously, and not intended by EH for publication.<br /><br />We get a peek behind the curtain, and learn among other things that Ernest Hemingway was addicted to letters, wrote lots and lots, starting in his teens; and that he was really depressed when he didn't receive replies; or when there were days when the postman brought no letters. Waiting for transatlantic mail added to his sense of loneliness. Letters were a lifelong passion of his, continuing up to the day when he took his own life. These private letters weren't meant to be published, and they are raw, but very honest.<br /><br />When you read them, you are in no doubt that the writer is a true artist, and an original!<br /><br />They stretch over the span of his productive life, and they are varied: addressed to family (his parents, his children), his ex, to friends, including famous contemporaries, such as Marlene Dietrich (just one of them), his agent(s), his publishers, and many more.<br /><br />I have a hunch EH must have been hard to keep up with, but his letters are fun to read; even though, in my view, his novels are mixed: Some great, and some I don't care for.<br /><br />Guess, EH's life was bizare too. The private letters are consistent with that. And yet, they exude a special warmth; both gentelness and passion.<br /><br />Reviewed by Palle Jorgensen. December 2004.	2004-12-05

And in fact, he became a leading and exceptionally successful nuclear physicist.<br /><br />Throughout his career as a physicist, he knew Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein well, and a host of the other pioneers; and he worked with them too.  He is fluent in at least 7 languages, and knows many more. All of this is part of his autobiography, which is also filled with charming observations about cultural differences, and observation of human affairs; including affairs of the heart.<br /><br />His whole life was divided between two Continents, hence the title of the book. But Abe Pais's life was divided in several other ways too: The first half was science, and the second writing. Marriages further marked dividing lines.<br /><br />He wrote a number of extremely well received biographies, the best one perhaps `Subtle is the Lord' about Albert Einstein (I have a weakness for biographies!); and his last was his autobiography!  In fact, he finished it only a few years before he died.

The book is also unique in several ways; autobiographical in many ways, and written by an outstanding scientist; one with a rare talent for writing, for making observations about human nature, and for interpersonal skills. Had Rota not turned to math, he might well have become a novelist.<br /><br />  A number of the protagonists in the book are the famous math professors Rota encountered when he was an undergraduate in Princeton in the early fifties; that was also the period of another illustrious mathematician, John Nash [later to become a Nobel Laureate, and the subject of a bestseller, and a movie; `A Beautiful Mind'].<br /><br />  The stories I enjoyed the most in Rota's little book was those about Alonzo Church, a pioneer in logic; William Feller, one of the founders of modern probability theory; Solomon Lefschetz (of topology), to mention only some. But you will likely select your own favorites from Rota's illustrious gallery. Rota paints his subjects with a mix of colors: humor, respect, love, insight in the human soul, wisdom, and personal reflection. What is charming and amusing is to observe thru the eyes of the then young and impressionable undergraduate student Gian-Carlo Rota, that the famous scientists shared personal weaknesses, and failed human relationships, with the rest of us.<br /><br />Reviewed by Palle Jorgensen, November, 2004.	2004-11-04

While the book is addressed perhaps more to students in computation and in CS, it is very attractive also as a text to be used in mainstream mathematics, and in probability theory.<br /><br /> It begins with a new look at the classical Kolmogorov construction of measures on infinite product spaces, and asks for explicit ways of labeling them with a class of certain concrete numerical functions. Then it moves onto noiseless coding theory (from communications science), but it stays rooted firmly in classical ideas from Shannon-Kolmogorov communication and information theory.<br /><br />It is indeed pleasing to see that God still plays dice, not only in quantum theory, but also in such classical areas of math as in number theory.<br /><br />From the foreword: \\"...putting Shannon's information theory and Turing's computability theory into a cocktail shaker, and shaking vigorously...\\"<br /><br />The book is a second edition 2002, with a number of attractive additions to the first edition from 1994.

In my teaching of the basic tools of mathematical analysis; and even going back to my student days, I noticed the hurdle that separates the beautiful definitions from the `messy' examples. Often students tell me that the theory looks so easy, `but how do we construct an example to illustrate the limits of the theory?' -----A counter example?<br /><br />Part of the difficulty is that the definitions involve quantifiers; and how do you check the quantifier `for all' ? And on top of that, there are the axioms of set theory: the axiom of choice, or one of its equivalent variants.<br /><br />  The lovely little book by Gelbaum-Olmsted was a savior to many of us when we started out in math, and it appeared first in 1961. But I had almost forgotten about it until by accident (while browsing in the bookstore) I stumbled over a new edition of it about a year ago, a lovely Dover reprinted edition. And so affordable !<br /><br />  In all the other books you learn about the wonderful things that are true about convergence, sets on the line or in the plane, modern variants of the so called Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and in Gelbaum-Olmstead you learn the things that aren't true. And then there are all the lovely Cantor constructions, The Devil's Staircase, space filling curves, and much more; beautiful, but little known constructions going back to Lebesgue, and some to Riemann.<br /><br />But more importantly the book gives students an edge when they have to do the assigned exercises in your analysis course.

Many people outside mathematics know of Julia sets, Mandelbrot sets, attractors, chaos, and fractals. They might have encountered them in color renditions as moving pictures that serve as computer screen savers. The book is about the underlying mathematics.<br /><br />  The rational functions (i.e., quotients of polynomials) form a relatively simple class of functions of a single complex variable. One of the operations we do on functions f is substitution: Starting with a complex number z (i.e., a point in the plane), repeated application of f yields a sequence of complex numbers (points), z, f(z), f(f(z)), etc. The resulting sets have a surprisingly rich structure, and they serve as models for dynamics that arises in different subjects. They are the subject of this book. I will let the reader discover the precise definitions in the book: The sets are defined from some basic geometric and analytic properties of these sequences. The set of points z where the sequence has one of two exclusive analytic properties divides the plane into two parts, an `inside' and an `outside', if you like. Well, the mathematical definition is more complicated than that, but the idea is roughly as I said.<br /><br />  The French mathematician Gaston Julia (1893-1978) was the first to make precise the sets that we now know from a host of fun computer experiments. And it is interesting that Julia invented the sets in 1919 without the benefit of computer programs.<br /><br />  Indeed the subject stayed in the background in the mathematical fashions until it became possible to easily visualize the possibilities with simple computer experiments. As a result, the interest in Julia's work had a more renaissance, and its connections to exciting properties in non-linear dynamics turned into an exciting subject in pure and applied mathematics.<br /><br />  This beautifully written book is primarily about the mathematical side of the subject, but it is full of hands-on-examples that illustrate the theory, and that are easy to follow for students. The exercises are lovely, and make the book eminently attractive for the teaching of the subject to students who will need very little more in the way of background than a familiarity with the complex numbers.<br /><br />  Palle Jorgensen, October 2004.of hands-on-examples that illustrate the theory, and that are easy to follow for students.

There is, by now, some variety of textbooks to choose from, covering quantum computing and quantum information;-- the output of research papers has been explosive since Peter Shor discovered his algorithm. From the start, one book stood out as being especially ready for use in the class room, the one by Nielsen-Chuang, but by now there are others.<br /><br />The present one covers more ground in physics (theory), but it has fewer exercises;-- other books (for example Hirvensalo) stress more the math and the CS side of the subject;-- the other books also have more worked examples, and are perhaps more immediately readily for the classroom. This book should still go over well with well motivated students in both math and in CS.<br /><br />The level is even, and a beginning student can progress in steps, following the text.<br /><br />Background: On the classical side, the subject started with Alan Turing and John von Neumann: Classical computation, as is well known, follows the model of A. Turing,-- strings of bits, i.e., 0s and 1s; a mathematical model, now called the Turing mashine. Why not two-level quantum systems? The thought was long in coming. It finally arrived, and with vengeance. An analogues model for computation based on two-level quantum<br /><br />systems was suggested in the 1980ties by R.P. Feynman and D. Deutsch. But it wasn't until Peter Shor's qubit-factoring algorithm in the mid 1990ties that the subject really took off, and really caught the attention of the math community. The 'unbreakable' codes might be breakable afterall! That there is a polynomial factoring algorithm, as Shor showed, shook up the encryption community as well, for obvious reasons. New elements of thinking in the quantum realm, and not part<br /><br />of the classical frame of mind, include superposition of (quantum) states, the EPR paradox, and (quantum) coherence. Although these concepts are at the foundation of quantum theory, they make a drastic change in the whole theoretical framework as far as computation is concerned: Now when one passes from the familiar classical notion of bit-registers to that of qubit-registers, the rather non-intuitive laws of quantum mechanics take over. Mathematical physicist and computer scientists revisit the old masters: Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Pauli,<br /><br />and Dirac. In passing from logic gates to quantum gates(unitary matrices), the concept of switching-networks from computer science changes drastically. The changes introduce new challenges, and new truely exciting opportunities. It is not<br /><br />easy for authors who break with tradition to make everyone happy;-- this is especially so in a new field,--one which has grabbed headlines, and one which is at the same time interdisiplinary. This is a great book to start with!<br /><br />Reviewed by Palle Jorgensen, August 2004.as computation is concerned: Now when one passes from the familiar classical notion of bit-registers to that of qubit-registers, the rather non-intuitive laws of quantum mechanics take over.

Like with all Remarque's books, the title is full of irony, and undercurrents of double meanings. Naturally, the book is not officially about Marlene, but she is hard to miss. Rather the book is personal,and has a good amount of autobiographical flavor. Yet, it is a captivating and suspenseful novel.<br /><br />Like the two protagonists in the novel, Remarque and Dietrich were themselves at a desparate point in their lives in 1939.<br /><br />Side comment: I am afraid that a lot is lost in the translation of Remarque's books. He only wrote in German, even when he lived in the US.<br /><br />In any case, Remarque is a master of a suspenseful openings, in his novels. This one does not disapoint!

When asked, friends tell me that they think a mathematician or a scientist would typically have lived a long, and comfortable life. Perhaps that is so, but far from all the time: not now, not a hundred, or two hundred years ago. In mathematics, two romantic heros stand out, N. H. Abel, and Evariste Galois. Both lived at the start of the Nineteenth Century, and both died tragically, Galois in a duel.<br />The author Infeld is a romantic, and great writer; and he happens to also be a scientist. In addition to this book, Leopold Infeld wrote other captivating books. He was one of the first scientists who sucessfully intertwined science with popular writing. Infeld himself escaped from the Jewish Ghetto in Cracow, Poland, at the time of WWI. As he matured, he lived as a refugee scientist and writer, and miraculously overcame an incredible web of adversities that were stacked up against him.<br />Other books by Infeld include an autobiography, called &quot;Quest&quot;, and a popular science book, &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot;, co-authored with Albert Einstein. Both books were bestsellers when they first appeared. I stumbled over Infeld's Galois biography purely by accident: Started to read late in the evening, were immediately hooked, and I didn't put the book down until the end, at sunrise. In the book we read about the last night of Galois's short life, the night before his fatal duel the next morning (&quot;There is so little time&quot; he wrote!). The young Galois hurriedly scribbled his original and profound ideas of matheamtics, and he gained imortality through the power of his insight. The life of Evariste Galois is a truly captivating drama, and written by one of the great story tellers.

Even at a time when a subject undergoes a revolution, and new directions keep coming, new methods; even brand new and different applications--- even then are there central ideas that are constant, the fundamentals. Within mathematics, approximation theory is such a field: In the past decade, we have seen a host of such new developments: wavelet approximations, fast computational algorithms with applications to turbulence, chaos and fractals; computational efficiencies from scaling similarities, and data compression; and new adaptive non-linear algorithms. The author Achieser of this Dover classic (first published by Ungar in 1956, and reprinted by Dover in 1992) is a pioneer in the approximation theory, and the book is still a very attractive first.

The author Infeld is a great writer; and he happens to also be a scientist. In addition to this book, Leopold Infeld wrote other captivating books, but this one stands out. He was one of the first scientists who sucessfully intertwined science with popular writing. The story starts with childhood dreams of escape from the Jewish Ghetto in Cracow, Poland, at the time of WWI. As the story progresses, Infeld matures and miraculously overcomes an incredible web of adversities that are stacked up against him. The narrative is personal and honest.<br />Other books by Infeld include a biography &quot;Whom the Gods Love&quot;, and &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot;, co-authored with Albert Einstein. Both books were bestsellers when they first appeared. I stumbled over this book &quot;Quest&quot; purely by accident: Started to read late in the evening, were immediately hooked, and I didn't put the book down until the end, at sunrise. Quest is also one of the books I return to periodically. There are several themes in the book: Anti-Semitism in Europe in the 1930ties, escape from Fascism, the upheavals of War, scientific work, and friendship, with Albert Einstein, McCarthyism, The Cold War. But more than all, it is a captivating drama, and written by one of the great story tellers. I am convinced that Infeld is less well known than he deserves to be.	2003-10-26

The original edition has been out of print for a number of years. This 1993 edition has added commentary and a fascinating bio of Gamow. He was born in Odessa, in what was then Russia, --before the Soviet Union. The story of his escape to the West is straight out of a thriller. Only it is real! Gamow was referred to by a journalist, some time during the Cold War, as &quot;the only scientist in America with a real sense of humor&quot;. He can take the most technical stuff and make it simple. Fun too! The book:--Intellectual treats, whimsy, but deep. Illustrated with lovely drawings by Gamow himself. Much of it can be understood by a child, and other parts might require a little concentration. All of it is great fun. Follow your imagination, and while you explore, you will learn about Einstein's theory of relativity. And in unexpected ways! You will see the wonders of physics thru the eyes of a child. With his unexpected thought experiments, Gamow has captured the imagination of generations of readers, and he has inspired a degree of curiosity that comes naturally to children.<br /> The author George Gamow started in nuclear physics, during the Golden Age of Physics, worked with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, then later in the US, on the Manhattan Project during WWII; and after the War, he was professor in Boulder Colorado. He has a building on campus of The University of Colorado named after him! He is one of the few scientists who wrote popular books. They are precious pearls, and they have been equally popular with my parent's generation as with mine. For awhile they were out of print, but luckely some have now been reprinted in recent years!<br />Other Gamow titles: Biography of Physics, Atomic Energy [dedicated to the hope of lasting peace], Physics of the Strapless Evning Gown,...We are lucky that Dover has reprinted some of them.

The landmark papers by F. Murray and J. von Neumann introduced Rings of Operators (now called von Neumann algebras) as a model for quantum observables, and as a tool in mathematics. Thanks to the conservation laws of physics, one-parameter groups of automorphisms have been used sucessfully as a mathematical model for time evolution in quantum mechanical systems. This begins with work by Eugene Wigner. While the mathematical structure of one-parameter groups is now well understood, thanks to the theorems of Stone and von Neumann, it is only in recent years that systematic results have emerged for the different, but related dissipative or time-irreversible dynamical systems. The dissipative framework includes the current models for quantum information theory, e.g., decoherence due to build-up of errors in quantum channels. This book deals with the mathematics of these dissipative systems. The time parameter is the half-line, and the transformations are now endomorphisms as opposed to automorphisms. The issues include type-classification of the semigroups, and the tools are operator algebraic. A new class of C*-algebras, called spectral algebras, is introduced, and they are of independent interest.<br />For over a decade, W. B. Arveson and others have pioneered research on the structure of irreversible quantum dynamical systems on von Neumann algebras, and the related operator theory. This book serves as an excellent introduction to the theory. Also included are other areas which have had an impact on the theory, such as Brownian motion, dilation theory, quantum probability, and free probability.<br />The book is suitable for graduate students and research mathematicians interested in the dynamics of quantum systems and corresponding topics in the theory of operator algebras.<br />Review by Palle Jorgensen, September 2003.	2003-09-22

This is a six-volume book-set by the authors Mehra and Rehchenberg. Both authors studied with Heisenberg and Pauli, and they knew the pioneers of quantum theory, Bohr, Dirac, Schrodinger, Born and others. Each volume concentrates on the work and the history of one in a distinguished group of six pioneers. The material is a fascinating mix of science, history, personal relations, competition, friendships, and the role of the mentors. Example: As the authors describe &quot;the operator method&quot; in connection with Max Born's work, they trace the ideas back to Oliver Heaviside, and they follow through up to the present time. The present vol. 3 is primarily about Max Born, but Born is different from the other architects of QM in several ways: He wrote lots of joint papers, he was the senior of them, and he served as math teacher to Heisenberg, Jordan and other of the &quot;younger&quot; pioneers. And, importantly, he was a mentor to the boyish (in 1924) Werner Heisenberg: At the time, Heisenberg asked Born if his pre-publication 1925 paper (Zeitsch Physik) was worth publishing. Heisenberg didn't even know what a matrix was before 1925. Well, Born told him, and as it turned out, Heisenberg's paper won him the Nobel Prize. This vol. 3 in the book-set is really wonderful; it is primarily about Max Born. There is a separate volume about Heisenberg. Born was the more mathematical of the architects of Quantum Mechanics, and he  worked with Heisenberg, and with others from the &quot;young&quot; generation. But Born was also greatly influenced by Paul Dirac. Dirac had his own independent version of Heisenberg's paper, and he realized more than perhaps some of the others the significance of non-commutativity. The operator method is thought to have started with Heaviside, but to have been revived by Dirac. And then others followed in Dirac's footsteps. Chapter V includes an account of the collaboration between Norbert Wiener and Max Born. Wiener in the US was visiting G&ouml;ttingen at the time, traveling via Oxford. Mehra and Rehchenberg describe how, motivated by Dirac, Wiener had extended Heaviside's operator calculus, how that was the start of the Wiener-Born collaboration, how the operators slowly became to be accepted from then on, approved by the Demigod, David Hilbert; and then how, via John von Neumann, operators in Hilbert space became the current language of quantum mechanics. Perhaps Wiener's influence on Born, and on the operator formulation of Quantum Mechanics is generally underestimated. Similarly, had it not been for Dirac, Wiener, Born and others, I think it is likely that the original work of Heaviside would have been completely forgotten.<br />Review by Palle Jorgensen, August 2003.n at the time, traveling via Oxford.

It started with Alan Turing and John von Neumann: Classical computation follows the model of A. Turing,-- strings of bits, i.e., 0s and 1s; a mathematical model, now called the Turing mashine. Why not two-level quantum systems? The thought was long in coming: From Bohr and Heisenberg to Feynman! The bright idea finally arrived, and with vengeance. An model for computation based on two-level quantum systems was suggested in the 1980ties by R.P. Feynman and D. Deutsch. Then another wait: It wasn't until Peter Shor's qubit-factoring algorithm in the mid 1990ties that the subject really took off, and really caught the attention of the math community. The 'unbreakable' codes might be breakable afterall! The fact that Shor found<br />a polynomial factoring algorithm naturally shook up the encryption community as well; and for obvious reasons. New elements of thinking in the quantum realm, and not part<br />of the classical frame of mind, include the basics of quantum theory: superposition of (quantum) states, uncertainty, and<br />(quantum) coherence. Although these concepts are at the foundation of quantum theory, they make a drastic change in the whole theoretical framework for computation: Now when one passes from the classical notion of bit-registers to<br />that of qubit-registers, the laws of quantum mechanics take over; and exclude the traditional cloning principle of error correction. Something different must take its place: A new theory! Mathematical physicist and computer scientists must revisit Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Dirac. In passing from logic gates to quantum gates(unitary matrices), the<br />concept of switching-networks from computer science changes drastically. It introduces new challenges, and new truely exciting opportunities. It is not easy for authors who break with tradition to make everyone happy;-- this is especially so in a new field,--one which has grabbed headlines, and one which<br />is at the same time interdisiplinary. -- This intriguing book covers several of the appropriate areas of physics (quantum theory, (some) experiment...), of artificial intelligence, of philosophy, of computer science (the mathematical physics side of the subject), and of math (operators in Hilbert space, and the theory of algorithms). In my opinion, the author did a great job. The level of the book is suitable for grad students in math, in CS, and in physics: It  could perhaps have used some more worked examples and exercises. (Fortunately they can be found in other books on quantum computation, such as the Nielsen-Chuang book.)  This book is timeless,-- and I expect it will also be popular ten years from now.book covers several of the appropriate areas of physics (quantum theory, (some) experiment...), of artificial intelligence, of philosophy, of computer science (the mathematical physics side of the subject), and of math (operators in Hilbert space, and the theory of algorithms).

You might not guess it from the title, but this is the play by Michael Frayn that for several years attracted full house at Broadway and at theaters in London. Background: The atomic bomb was built in Los Alamos during WW II by American scientists, and it signaled in 1945 the start of what we now call the Cold War. But it also ended WW II. Parallel to Los Alamos, German scientists in Leipzig worked on building a nuclear reactor, and the bright young Werner Heisenberg was an undisputed leader of the German fission project. However the science itself originated in Europe. The play has three characters, Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and Margrethe Bohr, and the location is the private home of the Bohrs. The book and the play paint a compelling picture of the three. When I went to the play in London, the audience sat in stitches for the whole two hours. I didn't see anyone dozing off, not even during the technical parts of the play. And they most certainly weren't just scientists. Much has been written about the other early atomic scientists, not directly part of the play, e.g., Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassman, to mention just a few. During WW II, in the Fall of 1941, while Denmark was under Nazi occupation, Werner Heisenberg traveled from Leipzig to Copenhagen to see his mentor Niels Bohr. WH had just been 25 years old when he did the work for which he won the Nobel Prize, and in WH's early career, Bohr had become a father figure to the boyish and insecure Werner Heisenberg. The much younger WH was 40 when he visited the Bohrs. Michael Frayn imagines that the three, the Bohrs and Werner Heisenberg meet in after-life to re-live the fateful 1941 encounter, and to resolve WH's motives for his Copenhagen visit; a visit that clearly ended a long and deep friendship. The Bohrs viewed it as a hostile visit, and that never changed, even though Bohr never spoke about what was said in 1941; not then and not later. WH had chosen to stay in Germany after the War broke out in 1939. Why? Did, or did he not, work on the bomb for Hitler? While we may never know the answer, the play offers five possible answers, and we must choose for ourselves. The story really begins before 1941 with the foundation of quantum mechanics in the 1920ties. WH's first paper in Z Physik (1925) is a scientific and a historical mile stone, and it is thought to be the beginning of quantum theory. It is from there we have the ubiquitous notion of 'uncertainty' (of simultaneous quantum observations of position and momentum.) The papers of the three giants Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Dirac in the 1920ties made precise the theory and the variables: states, observables, probabilities, the uncertainty principle, dual variables, and the equations of motion. This was also when the wave-particle question received a more precise mathematical formulation, and resolution. Perhaps best known are the equation of Schrodinger, giving the dynamics of systems of quantum mechanical particles, and Dirac's equation for the electron. All three of the pioneers won the Nobel Prize at a young age;-- Schrodinger was a little older than the other two (Heisenberg and Dirac were both born in 1902.) Many of the young physicists spent time in Copenhagen in the period between the wars, and Bohr was a mentor to them, and to WH he was perhaps even a father figure. Comment: In 1932, John von Neumann who had just settled in the US showed, surprisingly at the time, that Schrodinger's formulation is equivalent to Heisenbergs matrix mechanics, and von Neumann turned quantization into a field of mathematics. After WWII, Heisenberg resumed his work on the theoretical aspects of quantum fields and other areas of mathematical physics, and he was active as a scientific advisor to post war German government officials.

I refer to the papers of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, and Dirac which made precise the variables: states, observables, probabilities, the uncertainty principle, dual variables, and the equations of motion. This was also when the wave-particle question received a more precise mathematical formulation, and resolution.

In 1932, John von Neumann showed, surprisingly at the time, that Schrodinger's formulation is equivalent to Heisenbergs matrix mechanics, and von Neumann turned quantization into a field of mathematics. Von Neumann was a contemporary, but trained in mathemetics. His 1932 book &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; was reprinted by Princeton University Press in 1996. Occasionally the link to the foundations of physics have been missed: Reed and Simon quote Edward Nelson: &quot;First quantization is a mystery, and second quantization is a functor.&quot; Dirac's lovely little book represents a set of lectures Dirac gave in 1964 at Yeshiva University, at a time when the great master could take advantage of hindsight. The Dover edition didn't appear until 2001. The clarity of Dirac's presentation is truely compelling (no mystery at all!). Very little background is required on the part of the reader. Dirac begins with the Hamilonian method, and then passes to quantization in terms of physics. The mathematics of quantization on curved (and flat) surfaces is clearly presented in the second part of the book. Dirac's ansatz for relativistic theory is Lorentz invariance, and the equations of motion arise naturally as extensions of the 'classical' theory. The Lorentz-invariant action integrals are central, and Dirac covers the Born-Infeld electrodynamics in the last chapter. In total the book is only 87 pages, but Dirac is the master of effective and consise exposition. He also firmly believed that, as a rule, the beauty of the mathematics involved is a good indication that the equation is right for physics. Readers who enjoy popular books by the pioneers in science might like to check out Schrodinger's &quot;What is Life?&quot; reprinted by Cambridge University Press 2002, with a Preface written by Roger Penrose, and a lovely set of biographical sketches, written by Schrodinger, and translated by his granddaughter Verena.

What makes this Stephen Hawkin book different is that it collects together in one place the original papers of the great masters, starting with Copernicus, and ending with Einstein. A generation ago, Eric Temple Bell suggested that we begin with the classics when learning math and science. Traditionally, it was thought that modern books based on the classics offered more effective ways of introducing or presenting the material, and as a result only a few students (and teachers) took the trouble of looking at the original classics, the central papers of the great masters. The true landmark papers. All the while, they collected dust on the shelves in the back rooms of libraries. Of the giants in science, five stand out, Copernicus, Galilei, Kepler, Newton, and Einstein. A chapter is reserved to each of the five. Each chapter begins with a lively biography which also serves to place the material in the context of the history of science. This is followed with the original papers themselves in translation. With this book, readers can compare Newton's laws from Principia with the fundamental papers of Einstein. It is collected in one place with commentary. Complaint: The print reproduction of Einstein's papers is not good, and some formulas unfortunately have been truncated in the reproduction. Hopefully that will be fixed in a second edition.	2003-07-14

The book generated several scholarly reviews in major math and science journals, but the reviewers couldn't agree on what the book is about, so I will not try to characterize it is a one-paragraph review. Wolfram tries to identify a simple idea that unifies major trends in science. Many reviewers say that the idea is not original,--- that it is far from new, and that Wolfram doesn't achieve his goal. Judge for yourself. Parts of the book read well, and other parts tend to rant, making it hard to see what the gist of the argument is. The camps of readers and reviewers are very divided. I would say, 'Why take sides!' To me, the book and the many reviews are fun to read, and they generated a lot of discussion. More than what can be said about most math books. So that was reason enough for me to buy the book. Very few of my colleagues will admit to having bought it, even if asked.

Even if you aren't in math, I think you are likely to be caught up in the drama of George Polya and the various lives, the times, and the events that he touched. The writing is fast paced and engaging, much like that of Constance Reid's books: &quot;Hilbert&quot;, or &quot;Courant&quot;... Through its appendices [by K.L. Chung, R. P. Boas, M. M. Schiffer...], this lovely book further gives you some insight into the math that underlies the stories. Other characters in the book: G. Szego, L. Fejer, J von Neumann, G. H. Hardy, H. Weyl, E. Landau, ...Through the book, the reader gets to experience the tumultous historical period that spans the long career of G. Polya: His life includes the main centers of science and math in Europe in the Golden period between the two World Wars.  The second part is Polya's life of teaching and research in the US, at Stanford University. I was a guest at Polya's ninetieths birthday. It has been said that mathematicians have been more likely than others to have been uprooted in the upheavals of history, perhaps because they are concerned with theories and ideas that are more universal.	2003-06-01

A reprinted Dover edition of a lovely set of biographies of the physicists of the Golden Period, from the pen of George Gamow. The original 1966 edition has been out of print for a number of years. This 1985 edition is beautifully reproduced, and it includes fascinating pictures, sketches, and poems, done by Gamow himself. He was born in Odessa, in what was then Russia, --before the Soviet Union. The story of his escape to the West is straight out of a thriller. Only it is real! Later in the US, Gamow was referred to by a journalist,--- some time during the Cold War, as &quot;the only scientist in America with a real sense of humor&quot;. With his lovely books, we have now all come to experience how Gamow can take the most technical stuff and make it simple. Fun too! The book:--Intellectual treats, whimsy, but deep. It contains penetrating and personal biographies of Niels Bohr, Paul Ehrenfest, Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg, Albert Einstein, and recollections from the conferences in the 1930ties in Copenhagen, Brussels, and in the Solvay Institute. Illustrated with lovely drawings by Gamow himself. A book with pictures and conversations! Much of it can be understood by a child, and other parts might require a little concentration. All of it is great fun. The author Gamow started in nuclear physics, during the Golden Age of Physics, worked with Niels Bohr, then later in the US, on the Manhattan Project during WWII, and after the war, he was professor in Boulder Colorado. He has a building on campus named after him! The books he wrote are pearls, and they have been equally popular with my parent's generation as with mine. Luckely some have been reprinted! Other Gamow titles: Biography of Physics, Atomic Energy [dedicated to the hope of lasting peace], Physics of the Strapless Evning Gown,...We are lucky that Dover has reprinted some of them. Gamow's list of scientific accomplishments includes a 1948 landmark paper on the origin of chemical elements, the Big Bang model, and later work with F. Crick on DNA and genetic coding.-- Do more Gamow editions, Dover!odel, and later work with F. Crick on DNA and genetic coding.-- Do more Gamow editions, Dover!	2003-06-01

The popular press leaves us with the impression that math is<br />intimidating. This wasn't always the case. In my time, the approach to how we teach math, and write books about it, went through a number of cycles, or trends; some of them now discredited;--or not!? Here is a sample: (1) I grew up with the boot-camp approach with its endless drills, (2) then came &quot;The New-Math approach&quot;, followed by (3) &quot;The back-to-basics&quot; trend. (4)Following Eric Temple Bell, it became popular for a time to mix into the teaching of math a lot of history/ or dramatic stories about the heros in the subject. Finally, more recently:(5) &quot;The Make-it-Seem-Easy-and Fun approach&quot; and the motivational speakers; imitating popular TV shows.---Seriously, what I like about this lovely book is that it treats mathmatics as one unified subject, and that the authors masterfully highlight a number of unexpected connections between what otherwise are thought of as isolated specialties within math: The exciting new problems are at the same time also the old and classic problems in math: The elliptic integrals of Abel and Gauss, Jacobi's theta functions, modular functions, quadratic fields, elliptic curves, and Mordell-Weil. It is all beautifully presented. The book is selfcontained, and it is a pleasure to read. The clear and concise presentation is what makes the subject seem easy, or more importantly interesting and useful. I hope it will be a model for other math books to follow.	2003-06-01

Each of the three areas could be further subdivided, and could easily generate books in their own right. The author sets himself an ambitious goal; presenting mathematics as a unified subject. That is good, as many recent trends in math tend to fragment and subdivide into sub-specialties, making it hard for readers to get started if they are not already specialists. The author K. Jacobs succeeds admirably in teaching the fundamentals, and at the same time introduce newcomers to mathematical thinking. Ideas are traced thru time, the Greeks, the nineteenth century, and up to active and current trends in math such as game theory, optimization, and dynamical systems...Of the sciences, math stands out in the way some central ideas and tools are timeless. Key math ideas from our first mathematical experiences, perhaps early in life, often have more permanence this way. While the fads do change in math, there are some landmarks that remain, and which inspire generations. And they are as useful now as they were at their inception, the fundamentals of numbers, of geometry, of calculus and differential equations, and more.	2003-06-01

Of the many recent books on wavelets, this one by Jaffard, Meyer et al stands out. This is a new edition of earlier ones, starting with a French one, then a first translation, and now this expanded version. There is lots of new material, covering new developments, both with regards to theory and applications. The authors communicate the main points in a clear and attractive way, and it stresses lucid presentation of ideas over formulas. And with an infectious enthusiasm! The presentation is especially refreshing, in that the authors do not hide behind excessive technicalities and mathematical jargon. It is the central idea that shines through. And yet the mathematically sophisticated reader is paid his dues,-- in some cases via the appendices. At that point, the technical mathematical points have been well motivated. The emphasis of the book is the mathematics behind the many algorithms that emerged from the wavelet trends since the 1980ties. And lots of new stuff added (for example JPEG-2000), right up to the present. The book is rich in applications, many of which are not found elsewhere. The inclusion of motivation and historical remarks is welcome, and makes the book enjoyable reading.	2003-04-24

The spectral theorem of David Hilbert, John von Neumann, and Marshall Stone gives a complete answer to the question of which operators admit a diogonal representation, up to unitary equivalence, and makes the question precise as well. The theorem states that these are the normal operators in Hilbert space. This includes the selfadjoint operators which represent observables in quantum physics, and the more interesting ones are unbounded. Remember the Heisenberg commutation relations do not admit bounded solutions. But there is a mathematical distinction between formally selfadjoint operators (also called symmetric operators) and the selfadjoint ones. It is only the latter to which the spectral theorem applies. The distinction between the two is understood from a pair of indicies (n,m), now called deficiency indices. In some applications they represent<br />boundary conditions, and when n = m, and the boundary conditions are assigned, the symmetric operator in question has selfadjoint extensions. And we know from von Neumann what they are. A central question in the book concerns the issue of unequal indices. Then selfadjoint extensions do not exist, at least not unless the Hilbert space is enlarged. A central theme in the book is that in case of unequal indices, there is a larger Hilbert space which does in fact admit selfadjoint extensions. The co-authors, along with Naimark, are the authorities on this. Because of applications to PDE theory and to physics, there has been constant interest in the theme right up to the present. Even the current interest, and lively activity, in quantum measurement theory (in connection with quantum information theory) and entanglement brings back to to the fore this old issue around diagonalizing operators by passing to an &quot;enlarged&quot; (or dilated)Hilbert space, or looking for an orthonormal basis in the extended Hilbert space. So the theme of the book is still current.	2003-04-22

When the first edition of Katznelson's book appeared back in 1968 (when I was a student), it soon became the talked about, and universally used, reference volume for the standard tools of harmonic analysis: Fourier series, Fourier transforms, Fourier analysis/synthesis, the math of time-frequency filtering, causality ideas, H^p-spaces, and the various incarnations of Norbert Wiener's ideas on the Fourier transform in the complex domain, Paley-Wiener, spectral theory, and more. It is easy to pick up the essentials in this lovely book. Now, many years later, I occasionaly ask beginning students what their favorite reference is on things like that, and more often than not, it is Katznelson. Thanks to Dover, it is on the shelf of most university bookstores, and priced under US$ 10.	2003-04-21

This book consists of a selection of papers on wavelet themes. It came out at the same time of the CBMS lecture series of Daubechies, the one that turned into her book, 'Ten Lectures on Wavelets', which was issued in the SIAM series. The present book is a collective effort, and it is a volume in a very distinguished AMS book series. The subject of wavelts is special in the way it draws on a variety of areas within math, but even more unique in its versatility and its sucessful applications. Two general applied areas are signal processing and image compression. The mathematics behind this is timeless, and is highlighted in the book: Individual chapters by Y. Meyer, by Coifmann and Wickerhauser, and Wickerhauser(wavelet packets), D. Donoho(signals, densities and spectra from indirect and noisy data), and others make the book a landmark in the subject. It actually serves as an invitation to these exciting and related subareas of math.	2003-04-06

Don't miss these captivating tales of the life and the times of mathematicians starting from the period of Tsar Peter the Great of Russia, and right up to recent times, at least up to and including the Cold War. Even if you aren't in math, I think you are likely to be caught up in the drama of the various lives, times, and events. The writing is fast paced and engaging, much like that of Constance Reid's books: \\"Hilbert\\", or \\"Courant\\"... Over the tumultous historical periods, it has been said that mathematicians have been more likely than others to have been uprooted in the upheavals of history, perhaps because they are concerned with theories and ideas that are more universal. But their lives are still much affected by the times and the events of history: The French Revolution(Galois, Poisson, Fourier...), the Napolionic Wars(Cauchy, Abel...), the period of Bismarck and Nationalism in Europe(Weierstrass, Cantor, Lie...), the Russian Revolution(Alexander, Kolmogorov...), the two World Wars, and the crisis period between WWI and WWII(Banach, Hadamard, Courant, Hilbert...), and the Cold War(von Neumann, Wiener...). The pictures on the cover give you a sample of the profiles in the book: G. Polya, K. Weierstrass, A. N. Kolmogorov, N. Wiener, S. Kovalevskaya, and S.-D. Poisson.

It is as important as ever, but perhaps less &quot;modern&quot;. The subject of functional analysis, while fundamental and central in the landscape of mathematics, really started with seminal theorems due to Banach, Hilbert, von Neumann, Herglotz, Hausdorff, Friedrichs, Steinhouse,...and many other of, the perhaps less well known, founding fathers, in Central Europe (at the time), in the period between the two World Wars. In the beginning it generated awe in its ability<br />to provide elegant proofs of classical theorems that otherwise were thought to be both technical and difficult. The beautiful idea that makes it all clear as daylight: Wiener's theorem on absolutely convergent(AC) Fourier series of 1/f if you can divide, and if f has the AC Fourier series, is a case in point. The new subject gained from there because of its many sucess stories,- in proving new theorems, in unifying old ones, in offering a framework for quantum theory, for dynamical systems, and for partial differential equations. And offering a language that facilitated interdisiplinary work in science! The Journal of Functional Analysis, starting in the 1960ties, broadened the subject, reaching almost all branches of science, and finding functional analytic flavor in theories surprisingly far from the original roots of the subject. The topics in Rudin's book are inspired by harmonic analysis. The later part offers one of the most elegant compact treatment of the theory of operators in Hilbert space, I can think of. Its approach to unbounded operators is lovely.	2003-04-05

This wasn't always the case. In my time, the approach to how we teach math went thru cycles: (1) The boot-camp<br />approach with its endless drills, (2) The New-Math approach, (3) The back-to-basics trend, and (4) The Make-it-Seem-Easy-and Fun approach and the motivational speakers.---Finally Edwards suggests, following Eric Temple Bell, that we rather begin with the classics when approaching a subject in math. It was thought that later books based on the classics had more effective ways of doing it, and few took the trouble of looking at the original and central papers of the great masters. The landmark papers. All the while, they collected dust on the shelves in the back rooms of libraries. Of the classics, the true landmarks, one stands out: It is Riemann's paper on the prime numbers, what later turned into the prime number theorem. It is also the paper with the Riemann hypothesis, still unproved, now generations later. So it is a delightful idea including Riemann's paper, in translation, in an appendix. It would have been nice had Edwards also reproduced the original German text. Now the RH is one of the Million-Dollar problems in math. It is anyone's guess when it will be cracked, but in the mean time, it continues to inspire generations of mathematicians and students. This Dover edition is came out in 2001. The original first 1974 edition, Academic Press, had gone out of print. This lovely book seems still to be a model that we can measure other books against. Edwards' presentation is both engaging and deep, and the book contains the gems in a subject that continues to be central in math, the subject of analytic number theory.	2003-04-04

The book is at the interface of three areas, math, statistics, and finance. While connections between the first two have a long history, it was the connection to finance that caught my attention. Coming from math myself, I needed first to take a closer look at the book to orient myself. The mathematical subjects, smooth sailing, include stochastic differential equations (SDE) as they relate to PDEs; and the ideas from probability and statistics include Brownian motion, martingales, stochastic processes, and the Feynman-Kac connection. Browsing the chapters I found them to be a lovely presentation of ideas with which I am familiar. For me, it was chapter 10 that turned out to have stuff that I wasn't familiar with. That is the finance part, and it is based on a model for Option Pricing developed in 1973 by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. An arbitrage opportunity [simplified] amounts to the simultaneous purchase and sale of related securities which is guaranteed to produce a *riskless* profit. It was after reading more in this chapter I understood why the book is used in a course at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I am impressed with the level of math in this course. Part of the motivation in the applications to finance is that arbitrage enforces the price of most derivative securities. And I learned from ch 10 that the SDE of the Black-Scholes model governs the processes which represent the two variables S, the price of a stock, and B the price of a bond, both S and B representing stochastic variables depending of time t, i.e., both stochastic processes. In the model, S is a geometric Brownian motion, and B is a deterministic process with exponential growth. The two are determined as solutions to the SDE of Black-Scholes.	2003-03-09

Where it all began.---The book grew out from an epic scientific paper in 1948, but luckly its author Shannon chose a light touch and a gentle delivery in his presentation. The paper became a book, with a 1949 first edition, which is now a classic, and which has been reprinted a number of times since, ending with the present lovely 1998 edition. It is still the place where readers can learn the essentials, including the two equations of information theory, that are now named after Claude Shannon.	2003-03-01

The book by Shannon and Weaver (1949) is the classic; Shannon almost *is* information theory. There is more to it: The present lovely little book appeared first in 1965, but is still very relevant. I think it is a good next book to read. At least the mathematical part of the subject stays more constant over the years, as do the fundamental principles;-- that is what Ash's book is about. I especially liked ch 4 on error correcting codes, and the mathematical appendix which is centered around the Karhunen-Loeve theorem;-- the latter having found recent exciting applications in wavelet theory.	2003-02-28

The quantities on the two side of each of the equations in the book, are from science, or from life. The equations result from scientific experiments or from pure theory. Planck's equation signaled the start of atomic physics, and Einstein's E=m c^2 , the continuation. Dirac's equation reveals the secrets of the electron. All the equations predict physical reality; and yet they are strikingly simple to state, perhaps not to fully understand.-- They *are* beautiful! . Really! They are also fundamental discoveries that affect us all. Schrodinger's equation [along with the equivalt formulation of Heisenberg] puts quantum theory on a solid footing, and started wave mechanics. Shannon's equations initiated the age of information technology. And there are more: relativity, astronomy, dynamics, chemestry... The book consists of chapters written by authorities in the field, Roger Penrose, Steven Weinberg..., but no [or at least very little] knowledge of science is assumed on the part of the reader.

Fractals make headlines from time to time[--are they everywhere?], and and they make beautiful color pictures; but they are also part of a substantial mathematical theory, even one with an exciting mathematical history. This lovely book presents the subject elegantly in a way that it can be taught to students. It starts with the basics, then systematically, step by step, it builds up the central results. Great for the classrom, or for selfstudy! In view of the many applications to geometric analysis, to PDE, and to statistics, it is likely that fractal geometry will soon be a standard math course taught in many (more) math departments. Example: By now it is widely recognized that the selfsimilarity aspects of the wavelet algorithms are key to their sucess. Compared to other books at the same level, for example, by Falconer, 1990, and the equally attractive one from 1985[Falconer: The geometry of fractal sets], Kigami's book stresses the analysis of the Laplace operator. Falconer covers the theory more generally, and his books have a slightly more potential theoretic bent.	2003-02-24

The subject of wavelets is intermingled with a variety of<br />more traditional areas of math, and with exciting applications to physics, to engineering and to science in general. Wavelets didn't start in isolation, and even now in its maturity, surprising and deep connections to other areas continue to enrich the subject. The book contains a number of readable<br />tutorials and survey articles by authorities in astro physics, in turbulence[the largest number of pages are set aside for turbulence], in Navier-Stokes equations, in plasma physics, in solid state and atomic physics, in thermodynamics, in the subject of atmospherical blocking, in atom-laser interaction, mixed in with the math of multi-scale analysis, fractals, in quantum chaos, and more...The individual articles are relatively selfcontained, and the book forms a well edited unity, despite the diversity of contents. The book further serves an important purpose: Without the help of this book, it would be hard for students to extract material from the specialized journal literature. The subjects are well explained, and they are all amenable to the kind of numerical methods where wavelet algorithms excel.	2003-02-17

This book is the original source for reading about the use of numerical methods from signal processing in wavelet constructions, with an eye to applications. Mathematically, it is especially elegant, and its author speaks the language of applied math, and numerical analysis. By now, it has in fact become a central area in numerical analysis. The book is actually an updated translation[by Robert D. Ryan] of the French version [RMA, v 25, by Albert Cohen in the Masson book series], and I can recommend both. I can also recommend the several other wonderful translations, from French to English, of wavelet books by R.D. Ryan, for example his translation of French language wavelet books by Yves Meyer et.al. In the years since Cohen's book, we have seen a handful of books stressing the interface of<br />signal processing and wavelets which are very suitable for classroom use. I have taught from some of them, but always find pearles in Cohen's original book when I take it down from my<br />shelf, or when I need to remind myself of the elegance of the presentation from the original source.	2003-02-16

There are few books that sucessfully cover the interface of diverse fields, and yet this lovely book represents a subject that thrives on the interconnections. It is a great textbook, and it works well for selfstudy. The two subjects wavelets and subband filtering [from signal processing] are quite different, and have distinct and independent lives, they have different aims, and different histories. And yet, it is the happy marriage of the two that enriches the the union to an extraordinary degree. Multiresolutions are the bread and butter of wavelet algorithms, and they thrive on methods from signal processing, the quadrature-mirror filter construction, for example. One reason some books in the subject miss the target is that most authors know one of the subjects well, but not the others. Diverse subjects have quite different languages, and different terminology. The present authors are indeed on target, and they know it all. They come from engineering, but they know all the math;--the connections are made. And they strike a balance: Engineers can find what they want for the practical problems, and the mathematicians will not be disappointed. Programmers can pick up what is needed in their world. The book has been tested in courses, including mine. If you pick it for a course, the authors have material on their web pages that serves as a wonderful supplement. Lovely!	2003-02-13

But the book covers an explosive and exciting variety of developments since roughly 1990, and it is presented in the form of a graduate text. The basic idea begins with linear algebra, and progresses to expansions in function spaces, and multiresolutions. It will be useful to anyone who wants to learn from scratch about the underlying principles, the new results, and the applications. It is well written. A student of mine picked it up accidentally from my desk, and couldn't put it down. After awhile, he had completely forgotten what he came to see me about.

The authors of this well balanced textbook succeed admirably well in teaching the subject to the union of students in math and in cs, and to engineers. The danger with subjects that cut accross fields is that they might appeal to the intersection of audiences involved rather than to the much larger union. The authors seem to be at home with all the types of readers, they realize that the lingo and the aim is different for the different and diverse groups of students. Indeed, the tools of information theory, data compression, and arithmetic coding are widely used in science. While the mathematical parts of the subject is old[Shannon, Kolmogorov..., measurements of information, entropy, channel capacity], the applications are still going strong, with new things coming out at a fast rate right up to the present. So the emphasis in the book on data and image compression is very appropriate. There is even a JPEGtool user's guide in the appendix.	2003-01-31

I take it as a healthy sign when there is a burst of new books in a sub-area of math. In wavelet analysis and its applications, we have seen a number of recent books arrive to university bookstores. Surprisingly there doesn't in fact seem to be much of an overlap of subject or scope, from one book to the next. The subject is infinite in many directions, for example the kind of student it is aimed at, the level, the specialized area within math itself, and the kind of application it is stressing. D. Walnut's lovely book aims at the upper undergraduate level, and so it includes relatively more preliminary material, for example Fourier series, than is typically the case in a graduate text. It goes from Haar systems to multirelutions, and then the discrete wavelet transform, starting on page 215. The applications to image compression are wonderful, and the best I have seen in books at this level. I also found the analysis of the best choice of basis, and wavelet packet, especially attractive. The later chapters include MATLAB codes.-- Highly recommended!	2003-01-28

We are fortunate that Pais has given us this, and several other wonderful biographies;-- the one about Albert Einstein stands out! It is especially fortunate that he has chosen to write for the general public. I can't think of anyone who did, or possibly could have done it better. His writing is captivating, and unique in its recreation of the times, and the social context of the scientific events. Pais further succeeds magnificently in bringing to life the many colorful personalities. This includes the young physicists born in Europe around 1900 who arrived in Copenhagen in the 1920ties to work with Bohr, some later to win the Nobel Prize,-- how he became a father figure to some of them,- Heisenberg, for example. And there are the other players,<br />Albert Einstein early on, and Pais himself later, in the drama of quantum physics of the Twentieth Century.

Pick [1916], and R. Nevanlinna [1919]. They did it independently. Since the disk D (in one complex variable)is a model of a hyperbolic metric space, interpolation can't be done by just drawing straight lines. If two finite sets of points in D are given(same number of points in the two sets), the issue is to find an analytic function mapping D into itself, which at the same time matches up the points in one set with those in the other. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence, and the solution, when it exists, is the classical issue. Since this, the framework has offered a wonderful testing ground for main trends in modern analysis, such as the theory of operators in Hilbert space, and for modern techniques in systems theory of engineering, and of scattering theory. The material is wonderfully presented, and the book serves as a lovely introduction to the subject. It is written by two authorities in the field, and helps grad students get entry into an exciting, modern, and very active research area.	2003-01-05

The book should work equallly well in a one, or in a two semester course.

The central ideas are very attractively presented: It *is* an invitation! The other books in C*-algebra theory will typically be thicker, and they might be more narrowly focused, --more for the specialists, if you like. The first edition of Arveson's book is from the seventies; but still,-- now many years later, everyone knows &quot;An invitation&quot;, and reads it. Authors keep immitating its approach and its style: You see immitators,--authors in other specialties of math writing books entitled &quot;An invitation to ...&quot;. But none of the immitations seem to have quite the charm of the original. You can't very well **plan to** write a charming book in math. But when one arrives, we all know it. The subject of Arveson's book started with quantum theory, Hilbert space, spectral theory, and representations of groups and algebras.

The book covers classical and quantum algorithms;-- of the 250 or so, pages of text, roughly the first 50 pages are \\"classical\\", the rest quantum;-- and indeed the aim of the book  is to teach the wonders of the qubit-algorithms. While other books, such as Nielsen-Chuang, serve as (more or less)comprehensive references, the present book (by Kitaev et al) is focussed on complexity. The mathematical prerequisits are minimal, but a reader with some understanding of basic ideas from CS, and from quantum theory (at the level of ch 1 in Nielsen-Chuang), will get more out of Kitaev et al. The book is a translation of a Russian 1999 original, but it is really well done, and nicely updated;-- for example, a handy appendix was added, covering elementary math terms that are used.<br />The book does a great job in explaining the fundamentals, both at the level of the *intuitive ideas*, as well as the mathematical proofs.

Look!! It is in the book! (Hint: They all come about by clever manipulation of the letters in a finite alphabet, or the chosen 'digits' in our familiar number system.) These manipulations follow rules, and they come from specifying a matrix. Then the more abstract tools from mathematical analysis, and ergodic theory, enter when second generation dynamical systems, (abstractions if you will!)-- are built on \\"spaces\\" of all tilings in a given class,-- or on a specified varity of outcomes in symbolic dynamics. We then arrive at iterated matrix operations, and limits: We must solve associated  eigenvalue problems. Take limits, and if you are careful, you find equilibrium states which represent solutions to otherwise intractable puzzles,-- from math (for example, familiar, or unfamiliar, completions of number systems),-- and from applications to real life problems, familiar,-- or perhaps unexpected, tilings.

Classical computation follows the model of A. Turing,-- strings of bits, i.e., 0s and 1s; a mathematical model, now called the Turing mashine. Analogues based instead on two-level quantum systems were suggested in the 1980ties by R.P. Feynman and D. Deutsch. But it wasn't until Peter Shor's qubit-factoring algorithm in the mid 1990ties that the subject really took off, and really caught the attention of the math community. That there is a polynomial factoring algorithm shook the encryption community as well, for obvious reasons. New elements of thinking in the quantum realm, and not part of the classical framework, include superposition of (quantum) states, and (quantum) coherence. This makes a drastic change in the whole theoretical framework when one passes from the classical notion of bit-registers to that of qubit-registers. In passing from logic gates to quantum gates(unitary matrices), the concept of switching networks changes. It introduces new challenges, and new truely exciting opportunities. It is not easy for authors to make everyone happy;-- this is especially so in a new field,--one which has grabbed headlines, and one which is at the same time interdisiplinary. In this case, the authors succeed as well as anyone, I believe.-- This lovely book covers several of the appropriate areas of physics (quantum theory, (some) experiment...), of computer science (the mathematical side of the subject), and of math (operators in Hilbert space, and the theory of algorithms);-- each member of the particular scientific specialty has very definite ideas of his/her own subject,-- and that of the others. Nonetheless, in this readers opinion, the two authors did a great job;-- they explain math to the physics community,-- and they sucessfully teach quantum theory and theoretical CS to mathematicians. The book is suitable for grad students: has lots of great exercises, but it could perhaps have used some more worked examples. (Fortunately they can be found in other books on quantum computation.) The Nielsen-Chuang book is most certainly a great entry for students into this exciting new subject. There are other books,-- but they, for the most part, take a more narrow view.

The subject of functional analysis, while fundamental and central in the landscape of mathematics, really started with<br />seminal theorems due to Banach, Hilbert, von Neumann, Herglotz, Hausdorff, Friedrichs, Steinhouse,...and many other of, the perhaps less well known, founding fathers, in Central Europe (at the time), in the period between the two World Wars. It gained from there because of its many sucess stories,- in proving new theorems, in unifying old ones, in offering a framework for<br />quantum theory, for dynamical systems, and for partial differential equations. The Journal of Functional Analysis, starting in the 1960ties, broadened the subject, reaching almost all branches of science, and finding functional analytic flavor<br />in theories surprisingly far from the original roots of the subject. Peter Lax has himself,-- alone and with others, shaped some of  greatest successes of the period, right up to the present. That is in the book!! And it offers an upbeat outlook for the future.

However, I feel that there are many valid approaches, and that the subject is infinite in all directions.	2002-07-09

I used this book in my teaching of a beginning grad level math (harmonic) analysis course, but relying on three books in all. Harmonic analysis is a big subject with many points of view (infinite in all directions, if you will!). One of the directions is the link to engineering problems. Specific areas of math often serve as service courses for engineers; and harmonic analysis is one area with a rich set of links to engineering problems. Things are complicated however by the the difference in terminology which is used in the two worlds. You might almost say that they speak different languages;-and they have different aims, by necessity! --Benedetto's book makes a heroic, and, in my view, very sucessful effort in highlighting the engineering significance of the basic principles of harmonic analysis. Few harmonic analysis books even try. Benedetto's book may be a bit hard for beginning students(there is a lot in it!), but the investment my students put into it was well worth the effort.	2002-07-09

At many US universities, math departments offer service courses in math for the engineers, and there is a periodic discussion of the curriculum. One difficulty is that the two sides speak different languages;-- in math, it is linear algebra, calculus...,- and in engineering, signals, high-pass/low-pass filters, downsampling/upsampling, filter bank, polyphase matrix...A wonderful feature of the Strang-Nguyen book is that it speaks both languages. In this way it is refreshing, and it stands out<br />in a class of its own. It has been tested in courses for engineers, and stood the test. From what I hear, it is equally popular in the two cultures, math and engineering.	2002-07-07

This is a great book from which students, instructors, math researchers, signal processing workers,  and communications engineering, can pick<br />up the rigorous tools from Fourier analysis and sub-band filtering theory;-- and see in full mathematical detail how they are used in the study of wavelets in their traditional settings (from the 1980ties)of scaling of multiresolutions, spectral estimates, orthogonality,<br />Cohen's condition, tilings, and a priory regularity...The proofs are complete, crisp and elegant. The book can now be supplemented  with newer ones that emphasize algorithms more. And others with a more applied bent!<br />But Holschneider's book will likely remain a classic.	2002-07-07

The Wells-Resnikoff book on wavelets is in my opinion<br />one of the best:-- both with regard to the math--the proofs and all that!--, and the applications. The ideas in the book are timeless, and, I expect, it will be a great book for decades to come. It is very strong on both scores. And it is beautifully written: It is all there,- the history, the<br />motivation, the philosophical points, the applications, the guided tours with friendly author-explainations of what it is all about. For me, this book was a page-turner. I read it on<br />a long plane flight,- on my way to a wavelet conference in Guangzhou, China. -- And I didn't have jet-lag when I arrived<br />more than a day later. It may be a bit demanding on some students, but it will be well worth their effort!	2002-07-07

The term &quot;wandering vector&quot; is from the theory of operators in Hilbert space;-- it means that the vector in question is transformed into a family of orthogonal vectors under a prescribed set of unitary operators. Since wavelets represent<br />orthogonal functions in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on R, or on R^n for some n, it would only seem natural to merge the two concepts. But it takes originality to carry through the program: The book represents a success story in the application of operator theory to a current problem (in this case, wavelets) in classical analysis. What came out, for the theory of wavelets, was at first quite unexpected: You could have wavelets, it turned out, that are generated by fewer functions on R, or on R^n, than<br />had been predicted by the more conventional approach to wavelet theory. One generator is enough! The new wavelets turned out to be localized in frequency domain, and they gave rise to a variety of new trends in wavelet theory, the wavelet sets being just one of them, multiplicity, and the dimension function are others.	2002-07-07
US	49000954	R1PZ2842VZCNKG	0486695360	959313744	Hardy Classes	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A classic!	There are a few books within a subject of mathematics which<br />stand out from the others, and this is one. The writing is crisp, and yet engaged. It is also the place where we look up the fundamentals in the subject;-- and it is one which seems to be timeless,-- one that doesn't go out of fashion. As the fashions change, we still need to be able to refer to<br />the fundamental and timeless ideas, upon which the changing trends continue to rely. It is great that we have Dover to<br />reprint such classics in math. Even among the classics, this one is special.	2002-07-06

The word &quot;spectrum&quot; comes from quantum theory, as does the<br />subject of operators in Hilbert space. Since the early days, the<br />subject has grown, and branched out in a variety of directions.<br />This fact has perhaps made it difficult for an instructor to<br />chose a book from which to teach the fundamental ideas;--<br />those ideas in a subject that stay constant, even when the<br />fashions change. The topics covered in Arveson's book are relevant now, and are likely to<br />be useful decades from now.  They are beautifully presented.--<br />The material and the format have been tested in courses;-- and this book represents a formula that works!	2002-07-06

The presentation is clear and self contained. The book is great for an upper level analysis course, as well as for self study. Its emphasis is centered around the<br />multiresolution method, and it has both the basics in the subject, and<br />some exciting new results,-- those due<br />to the co-authors, as well as those of the analysts in the extended &quot;Wash U-family&quot; of researchers. It has a wealth of new material that<br />came after the 1992 classic of I. Daubechies (&quot;Ten lectures on wavelets&quot; SIAM ).The presentation in Hernandez-Weiss of, for example,<br />multiplicity theory and the dimension function is great for<br />the student who wishes to pick up the central ideas, or to<br />learn the details, step by step.  The book contains both history and<br />motivation, and it points the reader towards a variety of exciting and timeless applications.	2002-06-30
