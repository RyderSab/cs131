I lived in Yellowknife during the Giant Mine strike, the murder investigation and the trial. I can't describe to you in words how painful it was to live through such a thing. On one hand, the mine management was  greedy and arrogant, treating the workers as if they were stupid cattle  because they were uneducated; on the other, the union was incredibly  spiteful and full of intense and unwarranted hate, especially towards the  female CEO of the company, Peggy Witte. It was a clash between two very  unlikeable forces, and the result -- the murder of nine men whose only  crime was not to agree with the union bosses -- was devastating to both the  city and the nation. And for the murderer to claim he killed nine men,  leaving behind so many widows, orphans and bereaved parents,  because being  out of work made him impotent -- it just made me want to scream in  fury.<br />How, then, could someone write such a dull book about the matter?  &quot;The Third Suspect&quot; has no heart, no soul; it's nothing more than  a dry recitation of facts. Perhaps some people do find it easier to read  such an emotionally empty narrative of the strike, the murders, and the  trial; I don't know. But I for one was deeply disappointed.<br />I don't  recommend this book.	1999-01-16

Asimov&quot; is a much more personal work than Isaac Asimov's previous autobiographies. Although &quot;In Joy Still Felt&quot; and &quot;In Memory Yet Green&quot; provide the reader with an amazing amount  of detail, they don't go much further than to narrate the day-to-day events  of the writer's life. If you want to learn something of the inner man  behind the writer, this is the book for you.<br />We learn more about his  rocky relationship with his mother, the basis for the stereotypically  stupid female characters which show up in most of his early works; his  relationship with his second wife, the basis for the much more realistic  female characters which show up in his later works such as &quot;The Caves  of Steel&quot; (which makes me wonder if this is why young men  subconsciously prefer the earlier works); his troubles with academia, which  he admits were as much his fault as academia's; and of course his famous  ego, which at times gets in the way of the story. Even so, I cried at his  admission that his son was not all he had hoped for, and rejoiced at his  pride in his daughter's accomplishments.  <br />I can see how this book might  not appeal to a young reader looking for a hero to worship. Asimov isn't an  easy character to understand; a combination of insufferable ego and  blinding insecurities, of bad luck and incredibly good fortune, of  horrendous thoughtlessness and heart-warming kindness. He was an imperfect  man and he knew it, and he still loved himself. And good for him.	1999-01-16

If you believe Kelley, you'll believe  anything. Want to buy some land in Florida?<br />The Royals reads as if it  were originally a biography of Prince Philip, amended and expanded to  include dirt about Sarah and Diana in order to boost sales. But the dirt is  ludicrous! To give an example, Kelley implies that Prince Harry is really  James Hewitt's son, pointing out the supposed 'similarity' between them. Of  course, other than the red hair (which is also a Spencer characteristic),  Harry looks nothing like Hewitt, but how many readers are going to check?<br />What makes the innuendo impossible to believe are the unbelievable  number of factual errors. Kelley apparently believes Piltdown Man is some  kind of mystery, not a hoax (as has been known for decades); she doesn't  know the difference between Denmark and Germany, calling Philip's ancestors  &quot;German-Danish&quot;, whatever that means; she doesn't know the  difference between England and Britain, which is inexcusable in an author  writing about the British royal family; she believes that George II, George  III, George IV, William IV, Victoria and Edward VII didn't speak English  (of course they all did); and she doesn't know when Prince Philip's  grandmother died (well, she was only off by a few decades). And there are  dozens and dozens and dozens more! Dates, events, proper names, locations  -- if she can't even get the most easily checked facts right, why should  the reader believe even one syllable of her unsubstantiated gossip?<br />It's  astounding. I would be shocked at all the positive reviews of this book if  I didn't know how many people love trash even if it's garbage.<br />This book  wasn't even worth the energy expended in carrying it home from the library.	1999-01-01

But The  Physiology of Taste is more than a romp; it's a trip into the past. From a  detailed inventory of the senses (including the 'generative sense' --  there's no mistaking the author's nationality!) to a description of a  turkey hunt in New England while in exile, Brillat-Savarin's love of food,  good company and beautiful women is a reminder to us that life can be  good.<br />I highly recommend this book.	1999-01-01

Entire families perished; babies drowned in their mother's arms; young women with their  lives ahead of them froze to death in the icy waters. <br />Walter Lord writes  of these people, describing with eloquence their lives and what led them to  board the doomed liner. And although we've learned more about the disaster  than was known at the time this book was written, Lord's sympathy for the  dead and his judgment of the guilty are far from out of date. <br />And that's  the tragedy of Titanic; not some silly teenage-girl romance gone awry, but  the deaths of so many innocents with their lives ahead of them and the  realization that it was completely and totally preventable.<br />This book is  worth every penny. I highly recommend it -- and its sequel, The Night Lives  On.	1999-01-01

I learned that everything my family did was wrong. <br />We should have had a funeral, we should have had an open  casket, we should be prostrate with grief for weeks on end, etc. It took me  a while, and some discussion, to realize that these ideas are principally  American, and are foreign even to those of us in Canada. The very idea of  an open casket gives me the shudders, yet she says it's important. Go  figure.<br />I thought Lightner was right on in her acceptance of the grief of  adult children, friends, siblings, other relatives, pet owners, etc. I  appreciated her validation of my feelings that even though I was an  independent adult I still felt abandoned, in a way. She also made me feel  better about the way I was grieving, pointing out that the 'rules' of  grieving aren't cut and dried, and that everyone handles grief in his or  her own way. I appreciated that.	1998-11-23

Unfortunately, she brings a great deal of cultural baggage to her beliefs which may not coincide with the reader's beliefs  about death.<br />It is not necessarily better to have a funeral. It is not  necessarily better to have an open casket (when would it be better? Yuck).  It is not necessary to feel guilt, or anger, or shock, or denial. But she  implies that these are all necessary for healing.<br />Many of the rituals she  advocates are only carried out in the United States. I wonder if perhaps  she realizes that many of her readers will feel alienated by her unwitting  America-centrism.	1998-11-23

Aucoin  gives detailed instructions on how to achieve any makeup look from natural  to extremely dramatic. He also lets the reader in on the secrets of the  stars: you too can look like Audrey Hepburn or Marilyn Monroe, if you  follow his instructions.<br />I was especially pleased to see Aucoin's  techniques demonstrated not just on glamorous stars but also on normal  people of all ages and sizes and both sexes. He's got a lot of common  sense, too; he puts only minimal makeup on his teenage models (they still  look like teenagers after he's done -- what a concept!) and he doesn't  think much of child beauty pageants.<br />The book isn't perfect, though.  Aucoin advocates putting eyeliner inside the lash line. Most eye doctors  will tell you that's a bad idea, and so will most of us who lived through  the first time this idea became popular. Pinkeye, anyone? <br />He also  doesn't put much emphasis on choosing the right colours for the reader's  complexion. He advocates complete freedom, which of course is fine for  someone experienced with choosing their makeup colours but doesn't help the  neophyte who needs advice.<br />But those are pretty minor complaints. This  book is a fantastic tool for the person with some experience in applying  cosmetics. I recommend it highly.	1998-08-29

This woman  has no grip on the personality traits of any of the non-human species  created in the other Trek incarnations and brought forward into Voyager. We  suddenly have honourless Klingons, illogical and intolerant Vulcans, etc.  And none of the senior staff had a positive female role model in their  lives before Janeway? Sure, sure. That's how they became so emotionally  mature and competent.<br />Star Trek is wholly fictional, of course. But this  book seems to be a fiction inside a fiction: as if Taylor were living in  the Trek world and writing stories about the characters for the National  Enquirer. Strange days indeed.	1998-08-29

Her _Autobiography of Henry  VIII_ is one of my favourite historical novels. So what happened here?  Seems to me as if George is trying to turn Mary Queen of Scots into the  Renaissance Diana Spencer. <br />Heaven knows it isn't easy to write a  historical novel where your main character is as controversial as Mary  Queen of Scots. But George has turned her into a modern woman, leading with  her heart first, putting personal matters before state ones. This Mary puts  more faith in man -- and men -- than in her God, something the real Mary  would never do. Not only does this Mary think like a modern woman, she  thinks like a modern commoner. Certainly, it makes the character more  sympathetic, but it isn't realistic.<br />Mary Queen of Scots was just as  imperious, just as unconcerned with the poor or the Protestants, just as  pious, and just as stubborn as her cousin Elizabeth Tudor. She wasn't the  overly sympathetic, concerned, pleasant, normal (in a modern sense) woman  this novel portrays her as. It's too unrealistic.<br />The novel is also too  long. During some of the most intense action, around the time of Darnley's  death, the work inexplicably bogs down. It becomes dull at the very time it  should be unputdownable. <br />The section dealing with Mary's incarceration  by Elizabeth is also dull, but in that section the dullness is almost  appropriate given the empty dullness of Mary's life at the time. <br />Give  this book a pass; George's other works are much better.	1998-08-29

Since the  book can't be of infinite length, the author has to leave a lot out.  Roberts has left out most of African, South American and Asian history and  has concentrated his work on Europe and its colonies.<br />Roberts may be  accused of Eurocentrism, and perhaps with some justification; but he's  European, and by definition sees the world as a European in the same way  that an American writer sees the world only from an American viewpoint.  <br />His scholarship is sterling, though, and his judgments sound. I read the  book from cover to cover (and those covers are pretty far apart); it's  well-written, engaging, and accurate. However, if you're looking for a  history that encompasses the globe, this isn't it.	1998-08-29

The carvings sit, unnoticed by most, on a shelf locked behind glass at the  Yellowknife court house.

I walked past these carvings virtually every day before reading Eber's  book, barely noticing their existence.

I  found myself spellbound by the atmosphere Packard describes and by the  events he relates.<br />It's too bad, then, that Packard's research is less  than sterling, and his work filled with modern stereotypes and assumptions  irrelevant to Victorian times. <br />For instance, Packard writes that  Victoria herself was an unpleasant, unamusable person, when in fact the  Queen was a normal woman who liked nothing more than a good joke. (She said  &quot;We are not amused&quot;, but only because her target was telling  dirty jokes in the presence of children.) <br />There are other minor errors  in fact, by themselves unimportant perhaps but it does make me wonder: if  there are so many minor errors, how many major errors are there?<br />I was  also distracted by Packard's many references to Victoria's fitness level  and his wonderment at her reaching an advanced age without being physically  fit. Methinks Mr. Packard has been brainwashed by the health and fitness  detachment of the Politically Correct Police. People who live long do so  for many reasons. Fitness is only one piece of the puzzle, and compared to  genetics it may not even be that big a piece. It's also irrelevant on a  cultural level. Virtually nobody at the time exercised; to point out that  Victoria was out of shape is roughly similar to pointing out that Elizabeth  II couldn't fight the Romans because she doesn't paint her face blue as did  Boadicea.	1998-08-26

This book can help the potential dog  buyer avoid the heartbreak of choosing the wrong dog. <br />Coren groups  breeds by personality and matches them to corresponding human  personalities. If you're more extroverted or controlling or trustworthy or  whatever, you can find the breed to suit you best.<br />Coren's typing is also  useful for the potential owner looking for a mixed breed dog. &quot;Mixed  breed&quot; isn't a breed of its own; every mixed breed dog is descended  from purebreds, and the genetic components of those dogs' temperaments are  passed on to the mix. (Genes don't disappear just because they're in a  mixed breed dog.) With this book the potential owner has a better idea of  what temperament a little mixed breed puppy will have, and can match the  dog to their own personality with greater confidence than otherwise.<br />This  is all very well and fine if the dog you're planning to choose is  well-bred. Unfortunately, most dogs out there aren't. Pet store puppies,  puppy mill dogs, and puppies bred by people who want the kids to see 'the  miracle of life' don't have consistent temperaments. Puppies from these  sources have a far higher chance of having both physical and mental  problems. In fact, most of the modern prejudices against purebreds come  from people who have bought badly tempered dogs from backyard breeders or  puppy mill outlets. Coren doesn't address this vital issue. This is far  more than an unfortunate oversight; it's forgetting a major piece of the  puzzle.	1998-08-26

I applaud Friday's guts to stand up to the prudish Prunellas and false feminists and write/publish this book. Her take on women's fantasies is on the mark. <br />That having been said: if you find the idea of sex with animals as utterly revolting and disgusting as I do, there are entire sections of this book you may wish to avoid. Many of her correspondents discuss not just fantasies about bestiality but actual experiences with it. These women seem to have no conscience, no guilt about committing what is nothing less than a form of rape. Would these women be so accepting of pedophilia? Or rape of the mentally disabled?<br />However, as Friday is writing about women's sexuality and fantasies, I think she has a right if not an obligation to tell the entire story. If women are fantasising about raping defenseless animals, that is part of the story, and she shouldn't leave it out. <br />Again, another top-notch piece of research by Friday, but not one the average person can read wit! h unmitigated pleasure.	1998-08-09

If pure white was popular one season, everyone wore pure white. Then came Color Me Beautiful. Women learned which colours suited their personal colouring and which did not. Consumer pressure forced designers to provide a greater range of colours, and incidentally stripped designers of much of their dictatorial powers.<br />Color Me Beautiful has made women more confident in choosing their clothing and makeup, and is the first step for most women who are interested in making their clothes work for them.<br />Sadly, it's not perfect. The colour groupings work very well for blonde and brunette Caucasian women, light-skinned women of African descent, and women of eastern Asian descent, but don't work very well for light-skinned redheaded Caucasian women, dark-skinned women of African descent, native North Americans, and women whose ancestors are from South Asia, the Pacific or parts of the Middle East. The sections ! on makeup and clothing style are dated (inevitably, of course), and much of the advice (never go out of the house without earrings, for example) is specific to Caucasian United States culture.<br />If, however, you're interested in colour matching, this book is the first and best step.

This is fact. Dirty, disgusting fact. Pacepa was part of it, and admits to acts which would shock all but the most cynical reader, but his guts in publishing this book during Ceausescu's lifetime cannot be underestimated.<br />As Pacepa is no saint, he doesn't make an easy protagonist. Homophobic in the extreme, somewhat repressed, apt to treat people of colour with condescension, he's not the kind of man I'd be comfortable with, but that doesn't diminish the power of his words.

I'm sure there are people who don't like this, but, quite frankly, if you don't have time to read a book, you don't have time to apply makeup.<br />I only have one minor complaint; although Begoun gives product ingredients for most of the cosmetics listed, she doesn't give specific lists of plant oils and other 'natural' substances -- all of which are very common allergens. Ingredient lists aren't available for every cosmetic before buying (and usually aren't available at all here in Canada), and it would be nice to know, for instance, which c! ! osmetics include lavender oil, hazelnut oil, aloe vera, and other common allergens.	1998-07-16
US	53059219	RKIS3OLC6SF34	0553062204	173979751	Cindy Crawford's Basic Face	Books	2	6	8	N	N	Reading this won't help you look like Cindy Crawford	Let's face it: if you don't have Cindy Crawford's genes, you're not going to look like Cindy Crawford no matter what you do. However, if you follow her makeup guidelines, you can wear makeup exactly as she does. Which is too bad, because although her makeup style suits her, it isn't likely to suit you unless you already resemble her.<br />Ms. Crawford seems to believe that her colouring and facial shape are universal. For instance, she claims that anyone can wear black mascara. This is false: light-skinned blondes and redheads should avoid black mascara and instead go for the lightest shade of brown they can find. (Black mascara can look obvious and fake on a very light-skinned woman.) I'm sure other problems would exist for women of Asian or African heritage attempting to follow some of the steps.<br />The book is written in such simple English that I felt as if I were being talked down to. The information is skimpy (you'll find more on one page of any of Paula Begoun's books) and the photos more glamour shots of Crawford than useful aids for the reader.	1998-05-31
