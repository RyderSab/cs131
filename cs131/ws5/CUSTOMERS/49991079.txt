Phedre no Delaunay, her heroine, is a courtesan with a strange mark--a blood-red mote in her eye, \\"Kushiel's dart,\\" a sign that she is one for whom \\"pleasure and pain are intertwined.\\"  Well, \\"Kushiel's Avatar\\" takes Phedre's taste for pain and the intrigues that surround her and sets up a finish to one of the most interesting works the genre has seen in a decade.<br /><br />Phedre has two matters on her mind:  Melisande de la Courcel (formerly Shahrizai), in exile for attempting to overthrow Queen Ysandre of Terre d'Ange; and her friend Hyacinthe, doomed to a lonely existence as Master of the Straits unless Phedre can do the impossible and find the Name of God.  Daunting as it is, Phedre has searched for years.  When Melisande's young son Imriel (the son of the treacherous prince Benedicte de la Courcel) goes missing, Phedre goes off to find him--and her twin missions, for Imriel and Hyacinthe, take her into dark, hidden lands and lethal secrets.<br /><br />If that sounds like the worst of all fantasy cliches, then rest assured:  Carey pulls it off.  Weaving a truly scary group of people in with a retelling of the Solomon and Sheba legend, she takes Phedre from the figurative depths of Hell as \\"Death's Whore\\" to the equally figurative throne of God.  None of this would be as enthralling as it is if Carey wasn't able to make the reader believe wholeheartedly in her characters.  Scenes that, in the hands of lesser writers, would smack of \\"supercharacters\\" and McGuffins, are revelatory in Carey's hands.<br /><br />If for nothing else, Carey should be commended for introducing a new kind of evil creature:  the nightmarish sorcerors of Drujan whose shadows bring death.  But she not only creates images of great beauty and horror, she lavishes care on her characters' relationships, their hates and their loves--and nothing exemplifies this more than the romance between Phedre and her Cassiline consort, Joscelin Verreuil.  Joscelin's oath to Phedre undergoes a test that, frankly, anyone would be expected to fail; likewise Phedre's ordeal at the hands of a man considered to be Death himself is an experience full of transformation and anguish.  Carey treats this with compassion and only a little saccharine.  As for Melisande and Hyacinthe, the only two who have a hold on Phedre that can equal Joscelin's, they too emerge at the end of the adventure fundamentally changed.  Melisande becomes, if not softer, then certainly more human and complex--and, in the end, a tragic figure; Hyacinthe is not quite tragic, but still placed somewhat beyond the simple existence and successes he once dreamed of for himself.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this novel and its predecessors.  \\"Kushiel's Legacy\\" is a fine series, and an excellent example of what a writer can do when he or she decides to take an unorthodox character down the usual Hero's Journey.  I'm looking forward to her Imriel trilogy, and I daresay I'll probably buy any book she writes in the future.r Cassiline consort, Joscelin Verreuil.

Tanith Lee cut her teeth on beautiful, sweeping sword-and-sorcery epics like \\"The Birthgrave.\\"  Yet \\"The Silver Metal Lover\\" shines for all that it's compact and takes place in a contained area.  Lee is just that talented a storyteller to not be bothered by a change of pace, place, or space.<br /><br />Jane is 16, the daughter of a fabulously wealthy, talented, and knowledgeable woman who has little time for her.  She lives in a floating house and has \\"friends\\" who pity, use, and abuse her.  Far more comfortable with the men she sees on screen than the men she meets in real life, Jane is a virgin.  And then she meets Silver, a robot, and falls in love.<br /><br />\\"Silver\\" is an elite model of robot, one who can sing, perform, and function in all human ways.  Supposedly, he cannot feel emotion.  Yet when Jane finally has the nerve to tell him her feelings, the two embark on a relationship that seems like the perfect romance.  Silver encourages Jane to come out of her shell and insecurities, to experience life and drop the role her mother and friends have placed her in--that of \\"plain Jane,\\" too innocent to understand, too childlike to fit in.  And Jane teaches Silver how to feel emotion through her own immersion in it.<br /><br />Of course there's tragedy; the lovers can't have their idyll forever, and Jane ends up alone.  But she makes a discovery about the nature of her lover and about the existence she leads that makes the reader wonder:  just who is the tragic figure here?  Is it Jane?  Or are her mother and friends the tragic ones, leading such ordered lives for production or disorder that they've forgotten how to live?<br /><br />I recommend you buy this book in hardback, if you can find it.  Otherwise, laminate the covers so it won't fall apart quite so fast.  And whatever you do, don't let someone borrow it, because you'll never get it back.cause you'll never get it back.	2005-06-06
US	49991079	R2RTAETBP6EOOP	0385506031	519808491	Pride of Carthage: A Novel of Hannibal	Books	3	8	9	N	N	A fair but not quite convincing account of Hannibal	David Anthony Durham's novel \\"Pride of Carthage\\" is fairly well written.  That's all the enthusiasm I can muster for this novel, which purports to tell the story of Hannibal Barca, the man who sought to conquer Rome.<br /><br />What disenchanted me about this novel is that Hannibal and his family all feel like archetypes rather than real people.  Not once did I have a sense of getting to know Hannibal as a person; I might as well have stuck to reading Livy.  His brothers, particularly Mago and Hasdrubal, are flat, stock characters.  There's no emotional punch to any of their scenes, nothing to shock or even dismay the reader.  The women don't fare much better; we know that Imilce, Sophonisba and Bayala are considered attractive, even beautiful women.  But they don't live on the page.  The only woman who comes close to life is Hannibal's sister Sapanibal, and unfortunately she isn't seen often enough.<br /><br />Yet I could have excused all that if not for the way the novel ends.  Durham has Hannibal's son meet him after Zama as a child of about 10--when, if he was born before Hannibal began his campaign, young Hamilcar would have been closer to 20.  It's more than a little jarring, coming especially at the conclusion, and it ruined any enjoyment I had from the book.<br /><br />If you just want a good, fast read about Hannibal, this is a likelier choice than most of what's out there.  But it's no masterpiece.  Aside from the quality of Durham's writing, the only thing in its favor is that it's free of anachronisms (Colleen McCullough, are you listening?).	2005-06-06

The rise in quality comes not from the fast-paced plot, which is enough to keep you turning pages, but from Ms. Carey's exceptional development of her characters.<br /><br />The book picks up right from where Kushiel's Dart left off.  Phedre decides at once to pursue Melisandre Shahrizai to La Serenissima, the seat of the powerful Stregazza family.  However, there is one problem:  to do it, she must re-enter Naamah's Service, the sacred prositution of Terre D'Ange.  Phedre's decision causes a rift between her and her lover/protector, Joscelin Verreuil.  Joscelin, a former Cassiline celibate, is torn between keeping his vow to protect Phedre and dealing with the realities of exactly what Phedre does with her clients.<br /><br />There is a great more detail about some of these encounters, explicit but elegantly phrased and sometimes humorous.  (A scene where Phedre is bound up by a lover who tries, and fails, to interrogate her played beautifully on the fact that Phedre was as far from intimidated as could be.)  In the end, all these encounters lead to a staged scene which gets Phedre on her way to La Serenissima to find Melisandre.  And once there, Phedre gets caught in an assassination plot that sees her sent to prison, facing death, and undergoing a purification ceremony.<br /><br />The fun of Kushiel's Chosen is that while there's a romance at heart, Joscelin and Phedre stay true to who they are--at least, as the writer has written them.  Phedre doesn't try to shield Joscelin from the consequences of her decision to go back to Naamah's Service; nor does Joscelin attempt to \\"understand\\" or excuse Phedre's behavior.  Their warfare goes on for nearly half the book, with exchanges that made me wince.  Likewise, Melisandre is one of the best villains in fantasy--a dark goddess, seductive, and driven as much by love as she is by ambition.  And then there is the Stregazza family, with brothers Marco and Ricciardo fighting for position in the Dogal elections, and Marco's son Severin struggling to win Phedre's heart.<br /><br />There are more events I could discuss (the Unforgiven, Benedict de la Courcel's marriage), but why give the book away?  This review has already given enough of the novel away, and you'll want to savor this book page by page.  Kushiel's Chosen is a treasure hunt; get started and enjoy the quest.

She created one of the best-loved fantasy heroines in Aeron, and rewrote the Arthurian legend.  Then she wrote the turgid Blackmantle.  I hoped it was an aberration, a necessary cleansing of her memories and grievances that somehow missed the editor's desk, and looked forward to her next book.<br /><br />The Deer's Cry is the story of Brendan the Astrogator, the Kelt who led his people to space, and it should be a rollicking, wild ride.  Instead, Kennealy-Morrison puts the reader to sleep with an overlong volume of endless bickering between Brendan and Padraig, also known as St. Patrick, using their feud to symbolize the conflict between pagans and the Church.  That, I could have handled; the pagan world's reaction to Christianity was not always awe and acceptance, and it would have been a treat to show some real arguments and debates between the two principals--if Brendan had been less self-righteous, or Padraig the least bit sympathetic.  Instead, the characters are all drawn in black and white, the battle is overbalanced in favor of the pagans (who always manage to get in the last word), and everything about the Christians or the early Celtic Church is shown in the darkest light possible.<br /><br />I'm not looking forward to another book in this planned trilogy.  If this is the form Kennealy-Morrison plans to espouse from now on, I dread thinking about what her Gwydion trilogy will look like.  For now, I'll keep my \\"Keltiad\\" and \\"Arthur\\" trilogies as an example of what Kennealy-Morrison can do when she's focused and uses an editor.	2005-03-10

Nor is it a book that goes for cheap sentiment.  Ruffian's story contains all it needs of triumph, joy, and heartbreak.<br /><br />Ruffian came out of a stellar bloodline, with Native Dancer and Bold Ruler for grandsires; her sire Reviewer was considered Bold Ruler's second-fastest son, right behind Secretariat.  Ruffian herself was extraordinary, a freakishly large, near-black filly with an unearthly stride and speed and the drive to run.  Trained by Frank Whiteley, Ruffian was named Filly of the Year in 1974 and swept the Filly Triple Crown in 1975, becoming only the fourth filly in history to do so.  She was a legend in her own time, a horse who met or broke speed records, broke the hearts of competitors, and won the hearts of all who saw her through her beauty, her amazing swiftness, her competitor's spirit, and her composure.<br /><br />And then in 1975, in a match race with Kentucky Derby champion Foolish Pleasure, Ruffian broke the hearts of many when she broke her leg and had to be destroyed.<br /><br />Schwartz blends the details of the match race with the events in Ruffian's life--her startling debut, her uncanny speed at the track, and her rise to becoming the consummate racehorse.  She portrays the devotion both Whiteley and Jacinto Vasquez, Ruffian's regular jockey, felt for her, the prideful affection that stablehands like \\"Squeaky\\" Truesdale and Dan Williams felt for her.  And she foreshadows the outcome of the match race with details, such as Ruffian's tiny feet and delicate bones, that send chills up the reader's spine.<br /><br />The description of Ruffian's breakdown is emotionally harrowing, and the chapter remains taut to the moment when Ruffian is mercifully put down.  While Schwartz does resort to a device to depict Ruffian's end, it works because it depicts her death as the humane act that it was.<br /><br />If Hollywood could option the excellent \\"Seabiscuit\\" for a movie, it could certainly do the same for \\"Ruffian.\\"  Her story was tragic, but her life was a blazing round of glory, and it deserves to be told once more.licate bones, that send chills up the reader's spine. <br /> <br />The description of Ruffian's breakdown is emotionally harrowing, and the chapter remains taut to the moment when Ruffian is mercifully put down.

That's an interesting concept in itself.  But the conceit this book turns upon is its protagonist, Phedre no Delaunay, a young woman born with a scarlet mote in her eye--\\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" a mark designating her as one who experiences pain as pleasure.<br /><br />Before you think this book is soft-core S&M porn, consider the editorial praise Carey has earned.  They don't hand that out for Gor-like novels.<br /><br />\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" opens with a phrase that was either lifted from Mary Renault's \\"The Persian Boy\\" or a deliberate homage to it.  But it works in drawing you into this story that is easy to predict but delightful to read.  Phedre is sold into slavery in childhood, only to be redeemed by her strange imperfection; taught the erotic arts and educated, she is unleashed on several political figures as a player in a game of intrigue that touches on Terre d'Ange's royal line.  Of course, she soon runs up against Melisandre Shahrizai, a major if shadowy player on the political stage.  Melisandre gets Phedre exiled and sold into slavery to the enemy Skaldi, whose leaders plan to take Terre d'Ange for their own.<br /><br />Although the book is written along familiar lines, the writing is paced quickly enough to keep you reading, and the characters are likable.  One of Carey's strengths is that she never loses her narrator's \\"voice\\" in anachronisms, be they idioms, metaphors, or syntactical structures.  Her villain Melisandre just skirts the edge of excess, but exudes a charm and charisma when she's on the page.  Phedre's uncertainty and regretfulness are annoying at times, but at least she never drops into mawkish sentiment.  And Carey's dialogue is quite eloquent, a cut above most romantic fantasy where the characters usually express themselves in Hallmark-ian language.<br /><br />It's always good to see fantasy go in a direction that's not all about elves, dragons, and McGuffins.  For this and for the book's other qualities, I heartily recommend \\"Kushiel's Dart.\\"  It's as familiar, and enchanting, as a fairytale.not all about elves, dragons, and McGuffins.

But it is a wonderful retelling of what happened, and it is full of rich detail and description that bring ancient Rome to life--which makes it an excellent find for historical fiction enthusiasts.<br /><br />Saylor's hero is Gordianus the Finder, a young Roman with a dilapidated house, an insolent Egyptian concubine named Bethesda, and an income gained from 'finding' information.  He is hired by an up-and-coming (some say upstart) advocate named Marcus Tullius Cicero, who has just been given a murder case to defend.  His client is Sextus Roscius, accused of patricide; if found guilty, his punishment would be one of the most horrific Roman justice could mete out.  Gordianus must find out who really killed Roscius's father before the man goes to trial.<br /><br />The investigation leads Gordianus into the Subura, Rome's slum district, and into the rural town of Ameria; it covers sibling rivalry, the hatred between a father and son, and the political corruption of Rome under the dictator Sulla.  For Gordianus's findings lead him to one of Sulla's creatures, an ex-slave named Chrysogonus--and Chrysogonus's involvement in the Roscius murder raises the stakes dangerously high for Gordianus, Cicero, and his client.<br /><br />Saylor does a wonderful job of characterization, and his dialogue is pithy without being anachronistic.  He portrays Rome as a place half-decayed, half-reborn, with the glittering houses of the upper class juxtaposed against the sewage-splattered streets of the lower-class neighborhoods.  And Gordianus's observations are well worth the price of the book--he is a wry, sarcastic narrator, never dull or pedantic.<br /><br />The book does end with a twist that's rather timeworn, but the conclusion makes up for the unsatisfying resolution.  There is a definite sense of current threads wrapped up, with new ones just beginning.

I started reading it on my way home.  Six hours later, I finished the last page.  I would love to find another writer of fantasy and sci-fi who exhiliarates me as much as Storm Constantine.<br /><br />\\"Wraeththu\\" is a compilation of Constantine's trilogy: \\"The Enchantments of Flesh & Spirit,\\" \\"The Bewitchments of Love & Hate,\\" and \\"The Fulfillments of Fate & Desire.\\"  The titles alone give the hint that this is not your typical fantasy.  What they don't hint at is that this is a spin on the post-apocalyptic scenario once favored by sci-fi/fantasy writers--or that Constantine's crew would put a scare into every badass featured in the \\"Mad Max\\" films.  They are androgynous, hermaphrodites who meld male and female characteristics with enhanced psychic and magical powers, and who have no compunction about those powers or violence to get what they want.<br /><br />The Wraeththu rise up while humanity is in its final stage, overpowering their parent race and multiplying on their own.  The story concerns Pell, a poor boy who follows a Wraeththu named Cal, is Incepted (made Wraeththu himself), and becomes perhaps the most important of his kind on Earth.  As humans are slaughtered by vicious Wraeththu tribes, the Wraeththu turn on each other in a struggle for dominance.  While the philosophy of each side can be summed up as ultimate good/ultimate evil, the underlying desire is the same:  to rule and control all others.<br /><br />If the story doesn't grab you, the characters and Constantine's writing will.  Constantine is a marvel, a writer from the '90s who didn't succumb to the universal disdain for fine language and lush description.  Despite the Gothic label, Constantine's work will never be mistaken for gloom and doom.  She lavishes attention on her surroundings, and her characters come to life in the mind as they act out on the page; yet her affection for them and her love of life suffuse this trilogy with optimism and hope.<br /><br />\\"Nothing of him that doth fade/But doth suffer a sea-change/Into something rich and strange.\\"  This could be a fitting prologue to \\"Wraeththu,\\" for in it Constantine takes the shambles of society and shapes it into an incredible enchantment.e suffuse this trilogy with optimism and hope. <br /> <br />\\"Nothing of him that doth fade/But doth suffer a sea-change/Into something rich and strange.\\"  This could be a fitting prologue to \\"Wraeththu,\\" for in it Constantine takes the shambles of society and shapes it into an incredible enchantment. <br /> <br />	2004-09-09

Unfortunately, she's also a hostile, unpleasant one, determined to make her family (mother, sister Jenny, and stepfather) suffer along with her.  Jenny narrates this story, in which Chloris does her best to create a fantasy world in which she and her estranged father are reunited and happy, and where Jenny attempts to live with her sister's misery and the upheaval it causes.<br />Set in California during the 1970s, \\"Chloris and the Creeps\\" is like stepping back into a time machine and revisiting your childhood--the clothes, the slang, the TV programs, and the issues.  Platt doesn't sugarcoat any of it.  Jenny may be too earnest for some readers, but make no mistake: the one with the lesson to learn (and the blinders to remove) is Chloris, who is desperate to hold on to her illusions of happiness with her father.<br />Unlike many of the reviewers, I felt little sympathy for Chloris--and I doubt the reader will also.  While it does illustrate the problems of blended families and the pain of losing a parent, it also paints a true-to-life portrait of a girl who feels that, so long as she's unhappy, everyone around her must be as well.  It's not politically correct by any means, but it is well-done.  If you remember Kin Platt's Chloris series, or you know someone from a broken family, I recommend you buy it.	2004-07-17

I put the book away and decided to try later.<br />Well, over a year has passed and &quot;later&quot; came this week, when I sat down to re-read &quot;The October Horse&quot; and discovered I liked it better than I thought.<br />&quot;The October Horse&quot; refers to a ceremonial horse race in Rome, whereby the winning horse was sacrificed to Mars and his head made the prize for either the Subura or Via Sacra to gain.  The symbol of the October Horse for the Great Man who comes out of nowhere has been used by McCullough to mark Sulla and Caesar.  Never has it been more appropriate in Caesar's case than in this book.<br />Having crossed the Rubicon, beaten Pompey at Pharsalus, and made plans to deal with the remaining &quot;Republicans,&quot; Caesar goes to Egypt and there finds that Pompey has been murdered and the Ptolemaic succession is in danger.  The young royals are at each other's throats and the Queen, 21-year-old Cleopatra, is desperate to save herself and her country.  To do so, she must conceive a child by another God-Monarch.  She and Caesar meet for this purpose, and it is curiously charming--hardly the scene of grand seduction out of movies, but sweet in its depiction of the political reality of the event.<br />Caesar brings stability to Egypt and impregnates Cleopatra, but matters at home in Rome, Africa and the East all require his attention.  Cato has decamped to Utica; the &quot;Republicans&quot;, led by Labienus and Metellus Scipio, are marshalling their forces for battle; and Rome has sunk into chaos thanks in part to Mark Antony, Caesar's nephew, assumed heir, and bully-at-heart with plenty of scores to settle.<br />Of course Caesar puts Antony in his place, restores order to Rome, and defeats the Republicans.  And in doing so, he ignites the fuse of jealousy and resentment among the men he's pardoned or helped in their careers, men who owe all to him.  Out of this comes the conspiracy to take his life, led by poor Brutus and abetted by Antony.  But nothing transpires as they plan, and this is where the story picks up and takes off.<br />McCullough had introduced Caesar's grandnephew Octavius before, in &quot;Caesar's Women,&quot; and here she reveals him as a walking enigma.  Calm, controlled, sweet and even-tempered, but with a core of iron, Octavius is the last person that anyone--including Antony--would expect to inherit Caesar's wealth and mantle of power.  Yet he does, and his transformation from delicate youth to natural political animal is startling as well as convincing.  McCullough succeeds because she doesn't make him naive; Octavian is naturally intelligent, observant, ambitious, and burning to push himself to the edge.  Used to being overlooked, Octavian learns to use his frail image as a shield, lowering it by degrees to the dismay of those who take the boy for granted.<br />Brutus is, and remains, a pitiful character in this story.  A businessman unwillingly thrust into the military and political arena, Brutus is pushed into the assassination plot against Caesar by Porcia, his true love, whom he finally marries.  His brother-in-law Cassius, whose jealousy of Caesar fills his life with bitterness, is a one-track counterpoint to him, a man who only wants glory and a world without anyone who can steal it from him.  And Antony comes off as a lout, a bully, and a fool, one who comes to realize that he is in over his head when it comes to power, but who can't bear to let go of it.<br />The lesser characters are enthralling.  Chief among the portrayals is McCullough's depiction of Cato.  Easy to despise, Cato's final months reveal the contradictions within the man, the struggle between his true self and the persona he erected for his ownprotection and edification.  I found myself mourning Cato, something I didn't think possible.  Porcia, Cato's daughter, gets her one desire--Brutus--and then slowly goes mad from the stress and grief.  Then again, if I had Servilia for a mother-in-law, I'd go insane too.  Servilia is the most malign female character I've encountered in historical fiction, and her reaction when she discovers that her son and Porcia are wed is a hair-raiser.  Likewise, her letter to Brutus detailing Porcia's suicide will have the reader on edge, deciphering along with Brutus the truth of what Servilia has truly done.<br />There are chunks of exposition in this book, still, and it slows down the last third until the Battle of Philippi.  Then it ends in a rush, with an aftermath between Antony and Octavian that leaves no doubt in whose favor the balance has tipped.  This scene is tight and powerful; unfortunately, the conclusion of the book is rather melodramatic.  It works, but some tightening of the prose would have really given the reader a chill.<br />So yes, I liked &quot;The October Horse,&quot; and I hope McCullough tries her hand at writing more historical fiction.  The &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series is a good one, and surely she'd be able to find more worthies in Roman history to write about.protection and edification.

What flaws are they going to find that I didn't?  Am I going to want to drink a bottle of lye when they're finished?&quot;<br />I think the authors are safe.  I will note two things:  there are some errors the proofreaders missed, and there are too many adverbs.  That isn't reviewing; it's nitpicking.  On to the review.<br />&quot;Breeding Discontent&quot; is part of Storm Constantine's Wraeththu Mythos, and it introduces us to Constantine's world after the Gelaming conquest of Megalithica.  For fans of Wraeththu, it's set between &quot;Bewitchments of Love and Hate&quot; and &quot;Fulfillments of Fate and Desire&quot;.<br />The setting is a facility hidden in northern Megalithica, and the main players are Paran (a Gelaming official), Swift (now Governor of Megalithica), and Lisia, a young har in charge of the place in the absence of its caretakers.<br />The place is a breeding facility, and Lisia is one of its star products--a hostling, one who has been taught that his highest purpose is to become pregnant and give birth, over and over, in order to keep the Varr war machine supplied with potential soldiers.  Only the Varrs have lost to the Gelaming, and the Gelaming--Paran in particular--are horrified to discover the facility even exists.  To Paran, Lisia is unnatural, not only because of his life's work, but also because he is &quot;feminized,&quot; which to the hermaphroditic but &quot;balanced&quot; Gelaming is a perversion of Wraeththu.<br />The story pits Lisia, who has been abandoned by the facility's administrators to take care of himself, five peers, and all their collective offspring, and Swift against Paran and the Gelaming.  There are misconceptions on both sides.  The Gelaming see Lisia and his harlings as brainwashed victims at best and freaks of nature at worst.  Lisia's view of the Gelaming is strained through a prism of growing bitterness as certain truths about his life and purpose are revealed to him.  It takes Swift, as the all-too-partial third party, to step in and make certain that Lisia isn't exploited again, as well as to give Lisia the confidence he needs to decide what is best for himself and the little ones he considers his own.<br />The writing is clear and to the point, with the narrative switching from the discovery of the facility to Lisia's journal entries.  The characters are well-drawn, from Lisia's naivete and empathy to Paran's discomfited, bureaucratic stiffness.  The dialogue rings true as well--or as true as it can for this situation, which feels like an allegory for the exploitation of women and children in wartime.<br />It may be &quot;mythos,&quot; but &quot;Breeding Discontent&quot; is a fine piece of work on its own.  I recommend it for anyone who wants a closer look at the Wraeththu world beyond the major players in the trilogy.ness as certain truths about his life and purpose are revealed to him.

The oldest fairy tales were morality tales for adults, passion plays with a trenchant intent--and an emphasis on passion.  The original Sleeping Beauty wakes up not to the kiss of the prince, but labor pains from the twins with which he's impregnated her slumbering body.  And Snow White, as Tanith Lee reminds us, is the tale of the Devouring Mother, the mature woman who views her child as her supplanter and rival to be destroyed.<br />In &quot;White As Snow,&quot; the story takes place in an early-Christian-Europe setting.  Arpazia is the daughter of a minor king, whose domain and life are lost to Draco the conqueror.  Draco is a man whose life revolves around his desires for gold, power, and women.  Arpazia is fourteen and an innocent.  When Draco rapes Arpazia, she curses him--and to her horror the curse rebounds.  &quot;Black as the wood, white as the snow, red as your blood that under it flow--&quot; The curse takes the form of her child, unwelcome, unacknowledged until its birth by Arpazia.<br />Draco appears only a few times more in this story, which revolves around the traumatized Arpazia and the child Coira.  Arpazia armors herself against the world in her beauty and finery as Draco's unwilling queen; Coira sees and loves her from afar until a chance encounter reveals to her just how little she means to Arpazia.  From that moment the two circle each other, aware of each other's existence, but never seeking each other out--until Coira reaches her teens and Arpazia in her madness decides the girl must die.<br />The seven dwarves still play a part in this tale.  Given to a man who intends to kill what he thinks is some meaningless servant girl, Coira is befriended a troupe of dwarves who take the girl under their collective wing, but they are far from Disney's conception of fat, happy little people.  They dislike &quot;big people,&quot; even as they stolidly accept their mistreatment at their hands; Coira is nothing more than a freak to them, someone to be their token &quot;owner&quot; so they can work unmolested.  Yet the relationship that develops between her and Stormy, the leader of the dwarves, is sweet and unexpected--or perhaps not completely, given that this is a Tanith Lee novel.<br />Arpazia does come after her daughter; Coira does die and is revived by a prince; but Lee's version of this story is full of painful twists and insights.  Arpazia is not wholly a villain; she is, in her way, still a child, bewildered and horrified by the violence wreaked upon her and by the world's insistence that she accept it as normal.  And Coira is not entirely a heroine, in that she is a passive force almost to the end, save in her love for Stormy.  Mother and daughter are halves of a whole, yet like matter and anti-matter the two cannot survive together.<br />I wasn't satisfied with the ending of this novel, but I can accept that Coira intends to break the cycle of self-loathing she and her mother inflicted upon themselves.  My only other complaint is that it's far too short.  Lee could have written chapters more about the two, and still had an engrossing story.<br />&quot;White As Snow&quot; is a tale of suffering and forgiveness, but the reader will have to bear a great deal of the characters' suffering before reaching the point of redemption.  The cathartic intent of Lee's tale makes this more than a mere retelling of an old myth and bedtime story., but they are far from Disney's conception of fat, happy little people.

Presented through the narration of Selene, a survivor of the Amazon nation, Damon of Athens and his 11-year-old niece Bones (who has been Selene's charge), the story has some awkward moments and transitions.  It is not so much a love story as it is a farewell to a culture that has haunted Western myth for millennia.<br />Pressfield re-creates the Amazon tradition and culture quite well, but there are moments when Selene's narrations feel like an exposition dump and less like storytelling.  While much of Selene's past is laid down as a foundation for the tale to come, there's not enough of it to establish her as a person.  Selene is a cipher, the token Amazon who must act in certain ways to bring the plot to fruition; she never rises above it after her escape from Bones' father's farm.<br />While Bones must help her father and other men of Athens chase after Selene, her uncle Damon must give an account of what they will face when they finally catch her--and of the history of the last war with the Amazons.  The meeting of Theseus and Antiope is portrayed as a moment fraught with fate, but the one scene in which this love is best demonstrated--a debate on the merits of the free life versus civilization--is electrifying.  It's a shame for the book that the encounters to come are much less satisfying than the battles.<br />The overall tone of the book is elegiac, which does suit the subject.  But Pressfield renders his subject so remote that it's hard to inhabit the characters.  There's no chance to submerge oneself in the story; everyone, from Bones to Selene to the lovers Theseus and Antiope, are too remote.  In the end, so are the events.<br />No one does battles better than Pressfield, and he is a fine storyteller, but &quot;Last of the Amazons&quot; ends up feeling just like another retold myth.  But he does a good job of making the Amazon culture feel as though it might have once existed, without patronizing the idea.  Good for him.up feeling just like another retold myth.

Unfortunately for the original Romeo and Juliet, Wendy and James murdered Wendy's grandmother Elizabeth, and went on a shopping spree with money the woman had put back for bills on a limited income.<br />The story is lurid enough without DeFelice's prose, which approaches the ridiculous as he tries to dramatize a sordid situation.  Both Wendy and James were born to dysfunctional parents, but where James was in and out of trouble (and one correctional facility), Wendy lived with her strict grandmother, who verbally (and possibly physically) abused her.  James was a bully who terrorized younger kids; Wendy was having sex by the time she was 12.  And the reason these two kids murdered an old woman was so that they could continue their affair unrestrained.<br />DeFelice should take care in choosing the subject for his next book.  Wendy and James are far from sympathetic subjects--more like repellent reasons why parenthood should require psychological exams and licensing.  As for the grandmother, I pitied her cruel death, but DeFelice hardly fleshed her character out at all.<br />\\"Kill Grandma For Me\\" will do if, like me, you have an hour to spend at a boring function and nothing else to read (like a bus schedule).  Otherwise, anything else can replace it.  And no, Wendy and James are not Romeo and Juliet--more like pre-destined America's Most Wanted.	2003-07-07

The novel's main focus is on the conflict between Henry II, King of England, and Thomas Becket, the Chancellor who becomes the Archbishop of Canterbury--and the King's enemy.<br />Penman's main characters draw our interest from the start.  Henry is shown as a man always on the move, impatient, expectant of success, and capable of throwing frightening tantrums if he doesn't get it.  Becket is aptly described as a &quot;chameleon,&quot; and his personality undergoes a startling change when Henry makes him the Archbishop of Canterbury.  Once Henry's best friend, a man who enjoyed the pleasures of the table and luxury, Becket becomes, with his appointment, the champion of the Church and a foe to Henry's aims of making the clergy accountable to his authority.<br />Key to the battle are Louis, King of France (who has a vested interest in seeing Henry humbled), and Eleanor, Henry's queen, who warned him against Becket from the beginning.  In fact, Eleanor is the one who changes most in this novel.  She enters the story as mother and wife, able to offer Henry counsel equal to any man around him, yet relegated to the background or the marriage bed.  Penman shows her resentment without resorting to cliches; Eleanor doesn't rage, fume, or chew the scenery, but the reader can feel her frustration at being ignored by Henry at whim.<br />Ranulf also enters the scene, as Henry turns his sights towards Wales and forces his uncle to choose between loyalty to him and loyalty to his kindred in Wales.  The story doesn't grab the reader as strongly as it should.  Penman seems to be aware that many of her readers have encountered her Welsh before, and doesn't spend much time with description or character development.  Hywel, the prince of Wales, is a charming man, but he feels transitional.  His brothers Rhodri and Davydd are one-dimensional, and their mother Cristyn is not much better.  Even Owain of Gwynedd, the last true Welsh King, feels like Llywellyn Fawr without the sense of humor.  Ranulf's scenes are all too thin and don't have much payoff.<br />Also, the style of Penman's writing has changed.  I'm sorry now that I ever wanted her to break up those long paragraphs; now that most of the paragraphs are short, they feel choppy, and I miss the flow of her earlier work.  And while Penman hasn't committed the sin of the &quot;information dump,&quot; loading pages full of exposition, she does a lot of showing rather than telling.  There are many &quot;between the scenes&quot; passages in &quot;Time and Chance&quot; that should have shown some action between characters, instead of being narrated.  However, I'm not complaining.  Penman herself notes that she was sick while writing &quot;Time and Chance,&quot; and if she can write like this while sick, I can't wait to see what she comes up with when she's healthy again.<br />Oh, yes, Penman introduces us to Rosamund Clifford, Henry's mistress, and Rosamund and Eleanor do have a face-to-face meeting.  It is full of tension and crackling emotion.  And Rosamund is the friendliest home-wrecker ever created for fiction.  It is just as easy to believe that Henry fell for this beautiful young girl as it is to believe Eleanor's reaction to seeing her husband's mistress.  Not an emotional note is struck wrong; nothing plays false.<br />Although this trilogy will not be the equal of Penman's Welsh Trilogy, it is a fine piece of work.  I look forward to the third and final novel.His brothers Rhodri and Davydd are one-dimensional, and their mother Cristyn is not much better.

Alexias, an unwanted child, begins his story with the plague that killed his mother and uncle, among others, as well as Pericles the statesman.  The famous names appear as people who move in the same circles Alexias expects to move in as an adult; friends to his father Myron, associates, politicians, and--as this is Athens--wooers of Alexias as he becomes an adolescent.<br />But besides himself, Alexias's story concerns two other men:  a stonemason turned philosopher named Sokrates, who helps Alexias out of his shy awkwardness, and Lysis, the man with whom Alexias falls in love.  According to Athenian tradition, the older of a homosexual pair was supposed to teach the younger how to fight, to hunt, to behave in society, to be a man; Lysis does all this and also imparts to Alexias a desire to exceed his own limitations.<br />If this story was simply about the downfall of Sokrates, it would be tragic, for Sokrates' story is bound up with the fall of Athens and the rise of democracy after the Spartan victory and the tyranny of the Thirty who terrorized the city afterwards.  But it is also about the relationship between Lysis, a man whose integrity survives one disappointment after another, and Alexias, who seems destined to lose every dream he has.  The two of them overcome jealousy, loss on the battlefield, plague and starvation, and poverty; the one thing they cannot overcome is Lysis's determination to see things as they are, and Alexias's need to see things as he wants them to be.<br />The characters are richly drawn; Renault could make her people live through simple descriptions and dialogue, and the reader will feel as if they've lost friends when they finish the book.  Alexias's point of view is set well ahead of the book's place in time; the narrative has a poignance, an air of regret, that makes the moments of happiness seem that much more precious.  But there are wonderful scenes as well.  Any scene with Phaidon, the courtesan who became a disciple of Sokrates, crackles with tension and energy.  Agathon the playwright is shown as charming and flamboyant, and Sokrates is as homey and comfortable as a beloved uncle.  As for villains, who needs the Spartans when we have Kritias, a notorious member of the Thirty, a man who attempts to molest Alexias in his boyhood and then later helps to ruin his family?<br />The title comes from the Athenian dinner custom of tossing the dregs of the wine cup into the serving bowl and reading the patterns of the droplets for an omen.  The Peloponnesian War came through Athens' dreams of empire, and Sparta's rivalry with her sister city-state.  Athens' loss in the war foreshadowed the downfall of its own prestige; never again did the city rise to the power it had held prior to the conflict, nor did it ever produce, in Classical times, men like those who made it great.  \\"The Last of the Wine\\" is a tragic story, but it is also a farewell to greatness, the glory that was Athens..<br />The characters are richly drawn; Renault could make her people live through simple descriptions and dialogue, and the reader will feel as if they've lost friends when they finish the book.

While Renault wrote books that draw the reader into new worlds, few of her narrators have been what I'd consider ordinary people.  While I would love to sit and chat with Alexander or Simonides, I'd probably get tongue-tied and die of embarrassment if I actually got the chance.  Nikeratos the actor is a protagonist you can picture taking home for dinner and a beer.<br />Niko is an actor, reared to the craft from childhood, and the title of the book refers to an antique mask (Greek actors wore masks; none went barefaced on stage) of the god Apollo that he keeps at first for luck.  Niko himself is a man who always seems to come out well of every situation; when the book opens, he is fatherless and working with a struggling troupe when his grace under pressure (Spartans are seen heading for the town he's in while he's acting in a play, and Niko continues acting to keep the crowd quiet) gives his career a boost.  A rival's attempt to kill him some time later ends unsuccessfully, and this leads to his meeting with the man who becomes his hero and his shadow.<br />Dion of Syracuse, nephew to the tyrant Dionysius, is also a disciple of Plato.  He is a Sicilian aristocrat, a man who seeks to lessen the tyrant's iron grip on the people of Sicily.  Niko is awed by his presence and convictions, but clear-eyed when it comes to seeing how many of Dion's ideas--fed to him by Plato--will impact his craft and the society he moves in for the worst.  Without ever saying so, Renault makes a stern criticism of Platonic philosophy, which is one of the beauties of the book.<br />The death of the first Dionysius and the ascendance of his son, the second Dionysius, are told by Niko in a voice by turns cynical and amused.  Niko is a keen observer, and drops devastating sarcastic bombs with lethal accuracy.  (His \\"toast\\" to Dion on discovering Plato's views on the theater is one explosive moment).  But Dionysius II turns out to be worse than his father, and Niko finds himself supporting Dion even as he wonders if his friend and idol knows what he's getting into.  The climax of the story shows Dion at the moment of his greatest glory--and Niko's wish for him is painful in its prescience.<br />\\"Mask's\\" central premise is how the powerful and the performers wear masks to woo an audience.  Niko is fortunate; he knows when to woo and when to take the mask off and go home.  Never taking his craft for granted, he not only likes his audiences, he understands them.  Dion, on the other hand, sees himself as a liberator and teacher.  His audience is the mob, and the mob are to be led like sheep.  A man of dignity, Dion is willing to let the devotion of his people carry him to the highest rank, but once there he cannot take off his mask and stop playing the role he's set for himself.  And so we wonder, who is more corrupt--the tyrant who crushes dissent with an iron fist, or the politician who promises freedom and then scrabbles for the safety promised by the tactics of the old regime?<br />Renault cannot resist tweaking the readers with the end of her book.  Niko is nearing the twilight of his career when, after portraying Achilles, he is met backstage by a young prince from Macedon and his best friend.  Alexander and Hephaistion make their first appearance, and Niko's sorrowful musing on what might have happened had Plato had Alexander instead of Dion to work with ends the book on a bittersweet note..  But Dionysius II turns out to be worse than his father, and Niko finds himself supporting Dion even as he wonders if his friend and idol knows what he's getting into.

Niko is fortunate; he knows when to woo and when to take the mask off and go home.  Never taking his craft for granted, he not only likes his audiences, he understands them.  Dion, on the other hand, sees himself as a liberator and teacher.  His audience is the mob, and the mob are to be led like sheep.  A man of dignity, Dion is willing to let the devotion of his people carry him to the highest rank, but once there he cannot take off his mask and stop playing the role he's set for himself.  And so we wonder, who is more corrupt--the tyrant who crushes dissent with an iron fist, or the politician who promises freedom and then scrabbles for the safety promised by the tactics of the old regime?<br />Renault cannot resist tweaking the readers with the end of her book.  Niko is nearing the twilight of his career when, after portraying Achilles, he is met backstage by a young prince from Macedon and his best friend.  Alexander and Hephaistion make their first appearance, and Niko's sorrowful musing on what might have happened had Plato had Alexander instead of Dion to work with ends the book on a bittersweet note.	2003-02-15

It is a large, sprawling book that covers the end of Caesar's Gallic campaign and the Civil War between himself and Pompeius Magnus.  It is a thinly-characterized book that utterly fails to make Caesar's enemies threatening or in any way real.<br />When the most memorable scene in a book is from a letter written by one of the characters, that book is in trouble.  The death and burial of Julia, Caesar's daughter, is one that brings to mind the spectacle of the funeral for Diana Spencer, albeit the end of Julia's funeral evokes more horror than grief in the reader.<br />Caesar continues on the way to greatness, and McCullough makes references here and there to his having lost something . . . to being shorter-tempered, not as clement.  That's fine, but it would have been nice to read about him being shorter-tempered and less clement instead of being told by every character who crosses Caesar's path.  I will continue beating my head against the wall on this one point:  McCullough's anachronistic language is a distraction, and her portrayal of all Caesar's enemies as saps or braggarts is infuriating.  Vercingetorix was a grand warrior in the Celtic tradition; McCullough makes him a vainglorious adolescent.  Likewise the \\"Good Men\\" (the boni) at Rome are all depicted as idiots, bad-tempered malcontents, or foaming with jealousy at Caesar's exploits.<br />The backstory regarding Rhiannon (why does a Gallic woman have a Welsh name?) is interesting, but it fails to enthrall.  Rhiannon is, after all, only another foreign woman for Caesar to use and leave behind; although her scenes make her sympathetic, Caesar's lack of feeling for her makes us wonder why we should care either.<br />In this novel, the women again do not fare well.  The death of Aurelia, described in an appalling letter by Calpurnia (badly written to reflect on the character's lack of verbal expressiveness?  Or just another of McCullough's odd characterization quirks?), is told so badly that the force of her passing is weakened.  Fulvia's appearances are hackneyed; she shows up either pregnant, grieving, or raving.  Porcia, Cato's daughter, is the most startling of the women shown here, an eager, vibrant person who is so unlike Cato--and yet so like him in many ways--that she won me over, but she appears too rarely in the book.  As for Marcia, Cato's wife, she is flat.  The woman who loves the unlovable man sparks little interest, and is a bore when the book finally ends.<br />The sole reason I gave this book three stars is for its battle scenes and the end of Pompey.  Pompey, the spoiled darling of Fortune, meets a heartbreaking end in this book, and displays the charm and kindliness that made him likable in \\"The Grass Crown.\\"  McCullough, who has shown him as a sweet, egotistical bumpkin masquerading as a world player, treats him with astonishing grace in the conclusion.racterization quirks?), is told so badly that the force of her passing is weakened.

It is light, airy, and filled with enough scandal and rancor to put any Judith Krantz or Terry McMillan novel to shame.<br />That said, it is too heavy on the scandal, too light on the politics, and McCullough weights the scale in favor of the scandal by making her Caesar an impossible man to beat or block.  Caesar was an incredibly brilliant man, a political animal who achieved great military feats--but McCullough makes light of his faults by portraying his enemies as buffoons or fools, or worse.  Cato the Younger was a bad politician, a drunkard, and a bigot; yet he was also one of the late Republic's great Stoics.  Likewise, Cicero, albeit timid and insecure, was a great orator and a master of legal rhetorical technique; McCullough makes him a figure of ridicule all through the book.  No matter what the challenge, Caesar comes through looking like a hero (or at least with the last word).  And the scene with Lucullus is cringe-inducing--even though it was probably the reaction McCullough was hoping for in readers, it left me feeling as if I'd seen a bad bit of overacting.<br />Still . . . the book is titled \\"Caesar's Women,\\" and the women are something to enjoy.  Although McCullough likes to remind her audience of the patriarchal nature of Roman society (as if it could be forgotten!), still one fact remains:  a Roman woman was not someone to be ignored.  Be she widow, crone, Vestal, whore or lawful wife, her society and her culture acknowledged her existence, no matter how bounded it was by custom and morality.  And although the surviving histories focus on the men, Roman women had great influence on their families, particularly their sons and daughters, and that influence contributed to the ideals of the Republic.<br />A grand example is Servilia, the wife of Decius Junius Silanus, mother of the young Brutus--a cruel, hateful, beautiful woman who falls utterly under Caesar's thumb.  Of course the attraction is instant, but to call this a romance would be a misnomer.  Servilia is in love; Caesar is simply in lust, and too perceptive of Servilia's true character to lose his heart to her.  The relationship is so well portrayed, it makes up for the casting of Caesar as the Superman of the Republic.<br />At this stage of her life, Servilia is wed to a man she cordially despises, and is the mother of daughters she ignores and a son she browbeats into submission.  Poor Brutus is so dominated by his mother that the few forms of rebellion he commits usually come back to bite him--avoiding an active lifestyle, for one, including his military training.  Yet Servilia is also a force to be reckoned with, something Caesar keeps in mind as he avoids her attempts to strengthen their sexual intimacy into something more.<br />Caesar's favorite activity of cuckolding his political enemies is continued here.  The victims are many, with the grandest display of outrage belonging to Cato.  And McCullough does weaken his image as a flawless charmer in depicting his marriage to Pompeia Sulla.  A \\"beautiful idiot,\\" Pompeia is described as silly, dull, materialistic, tasteless--in short, almost every shortcoming ever ascribed to a woman except physical ugliness.  Caesar's contempt is almost instant; his treatment of her, completely restricting her comings and goings, is tyrannical--but who enforces it all?  His mother, Aurelia.<br />Perhaps the best female character McCullough has created is Aurelia, Caesar's mother, and she is phenomenal.  Whenever Aurelia enters the scene, she captures attention.  Her actions at the Bona Dea feast, with Clodius Pulcher, will make your hair stand on end.  But McCullough aged her \\"portrait,\\" just as she did Sulla's in \\"Fortune's Favorites\\"--and I doubt anyone could detest it as much as I do.<br />A close runner-up for best female character is Fulvia, Pulcher's wife.  A screaming, uninhibited force of nature, Fulvia doesn't do much in \\"Caesar's Women,\\" but when she's around it's impossible to ignore her.  As for the most charming, that would be Julia, Caesar's daughter.  A wise, sweet child, hardly precious or overweening (anyone remember the author's portrayal of young Cicero?), Julia is a heart-stealer from the first moment she appears.  But for mousiest female, Calpurnia (Caesar's third wife) would take the prize.  And for most unpleasant . . . Servilia would win the laurels.  The poster child for the havoc a loveless childhood can wreak, Servilia darkens the scene whenever she appears--but it's impossible not to snicker and enjoy the mayhem that ensues when she does.<br />I've avoided going into detail about the book to keep from spoiling it for other readers.  I will recommend it--it's a fine portrayal of the end of the Roman Republic, and it does a beautiful job of portraying Roman women in all their power, strength, and personality.uch as I do.<br />A close runner-up for best female character is Fulvia, Pulcher's wife.

In \\"The Bull From The Sea,\\" Theseus confronts the rest of his life and the strange destiny foretold to him on his homecoming from Crete.<br />Theseus's homecoming is marked by tragedy.  His father Aigeus dies on seeing his ship come in with a black sail, thinking Theseus is lost.  An old crone warns him, \\"Loose not the Bull from the Sea!\\" and, thanks to an encounter with a fearsome white bull imported from Crete, Theseus believes he's met the curse and dispelled any danger to himself or his reign.  He attempts to settle down, eventually betrothing himself to young Phaedra, daughter of the dead king Minos of Crete.<br />Unfortunately for Phaedra, Theseus's friend Pirithous (a wonderful scoundrel) leads him off on an adventure to the Black Sea.  There, Theseus encounters Amazons--notably, their young leader Hippolyta, with whom he falls in love.  And his life takes a strange turn, for better and for worse.<br />Theseus continues to be cocky, but as the story goes along his tone changes; he becomes wearier, more cynical, with the passage of time and grief.  Hippolyta is vividly portrayed, a grave young woman full of honor and bravery, who helps Theseus create a life in Athens that keeps his restlessness contained.  When the Amazons come to reclaim their queen, Theseus and Hippolyta make a believable pair; the depiction of the battles are Homeric, thrilling and poetic.  But when Theseus wins the war and loses Hippolyta, he loses a vital part of himself as well--the king is swiftly replaced by the adventurer.<br />All the elements of the myth are accounted for.  Pirithous's wedding feast and the battle of the Centaurs is like a train-wreck; we see it coming and can't look away for all the pain.  So is the end of Oedipus at Kolonos.  This is the most beautiful chapter in the book, and it foreshadows Theseus's end without giving anything away.  Oedipus, the man who tried to outrun a curse, is the adventurer who also found a kingdom and lost everything in the end; Theseus, still young and powerful, is too horrified by what he must do for Oedipus to read anything into his fate for himself. But the episode of Hippolytus and Phaedra is the grimmest of all, a tangle of misunderstandings and lies that drives Theseus to curse his own son.  That he justifies it to himself at the moment makes his epiphany later a bitter experience.<br />The epilogue, if it can be called that, is Theseus's reclamation from that act, and his atonement.  The final paragraphs, melancholy yet wistful, are a fitting end to this story of a man who longed to be a legend and became one, only to be tripped up by his pride in the end.eus's end without giving anything away.

Alexander's character has fascinated historians and novelists from the time of his conquest to the present day.  Currently, a movie is in the works that is said to owe much to Ms. Renault's work.<br />Mary Renault's love of ancient Greek culture was displayed in her previous novels, \\"The Last Of The Wine\\" and the Theseus duology, \\"The King Must Die\\" and \\"The Bull From The Sea.\\"  Her admiration for Alexander is also on display.  Most authors of historical fiction are fond of their subjects, but the reader can tell Renault adored her chosen hero and found in him an ideal that may have been more imagined than real.<br />Still, Renault's work is superb.  She was a master of language and craft, and her novel touches the key points of the Alexander legend without turning them into precious showpieces.  (I particularly enjoyed the depiction of the taming of Boukephalos, with various characters facing different outcomes of the horse's purchase).  She shines when depicting characters, and offers a fascinating interpretation of the relationship between Alexander, his father King Philip II of Macedon, and his mother, Queen Olympias.<br />History tells us Philip and Olympias were at war with each other until Philip was assassinated, which Olympias probably had a hand in.  The war included their son, who is shown as an intelligent, preternaturally observant child who absorbs his mother's hurts and grievances well before he's old enough to understand them.  Alexander is never allowed to be at peace as far as his loyalty to either parent is concerned; torn between a father who resents any resemblance in him to his mother, and a mother who has made him her defender and prize, Alexander's mystical bent is made plausible as the defense of a child who literally had no one else but God (or in his case, the gods) to turn to.  A psychiatrist would have had a field day with the entire family, let alone with Alexander himself.<br />Perhaps Renault wanted to show Alexander as being able to rise above the turmoil his household was in, but she doesn't dwell on his vulnerability.  That is a weakness in this book; Alexander is brilliant and bright, but rarely falls or missteps.  The one time he makes a true mistake, leading to the arrest of a friend, is a scene of white-hot intensity, including the aftermath of the scene.  If Renault had shown more of Alexander's weaknesses--his humanity--this book would have been a scorching testament to the beginnings of this complex man.<br />It is still a very good novel, particularly when Hephaistion enters Alexander's life.  The man who may or may not have been Alexander's lover is portrayed as that by Renault, and her reasons are as good as any to believe the two men were lovers.  Hephaistion is written well here, as the person Alexander trusted more than anyone, and who did all he could to deserve that trust.  His single-minded devotion is a little annoying--surely Renault could have had him win an argument once instead of always giving in?--but Hephaistion still draws much sympathy, in light of all he goes through in order to remain at Alexander's side.<br />Renault wrote good battle scenes, and the Battle of Cheironeia (Chaeronea) is one of her best efforts.  So, too, are the snippets from the Thracian wars and the Argive revolt in which Alexander saved his father's life (although the language is a little high-flown in the last).  She had an eye for telling detail, making the reader visualize an entire scene from one small description.  Two wonderful examples would be the aftermath of Cheironeia and the assassination of Philip.<br />I recommend \\"Fire From Heaven\\" because it's a beautifully written book and its history is portrayed with accuracy and skill.  It's not quite as good as its successors, \\"The Persian Boy\\" and \\"Funeral Games,\\" but it's like comparing fine apples to equally high-quality oranges.  Enjoy it.aring fine apples to equally high-quality oranges.  Enjoy it.	2002-12-14

After putting it off, he finally gave in and was hooked from the first sentence.  Mary Renault casts a spell from the first in \\"The Persian Boy\\", the pivot of her Alexandriad.<br />Bagoas is born into an aristocratic family; the turmoil following the death of King Ochos claims his father, mother and sisters, and he himself is castrated and sold at the age of 10.  The twin horrors are followed in time by another; Bagoas is himself sold by his master to other men as a prostitute.  Procured for King Darius, Bagoas's lot changes only slightly; instead of being sold to many men, he is kept by one man, a King he holds in awe for his station, and not out of personal admiration.<br />Darius has made the mistake of underestimating the young Macedonian King Alexander, who at 20 undertakes the reconquest of Greek cities in Asia Minor.  But Alexander closes in on the Persian Empire, and Darius suffers one defeat after another until his own warlords lose faith in him.  When a coup sees Darius taken prisoner, Bagoas escapes with only his life.  In time he is rescued by one of those warlords, who decides to beg Alexander for clemency.  Who does he bring to sweeten the plea?  Bagoas--as a gift.<br />Alexander is presented by Renault as a man capable of more than mortal feats who is still reassuringly human--more than that, he needs love desperately, from the hero-worship of the soldiers who follow him to the intimate devotion of his lover Hephaistion.  Bagoas has never known love at all, only use.  When Macedonian King and Persian courtesan meet, the inevitable happens--and this is where the enchantment begins.<br />Renault's mastery is impeccable.  With a few well-chosen words, she conjures the images of the great Persian palaces--the ruins at Persepolis, Susa, Ekbatana, and Babylon; she recreates the travels of the Macedonian army so well that any reader who picks up her companion book \\"The Nature of Alexander\\" will look at the pictures and exclaim, \\"I know this!  This is--\\" and name the very scene.  But it is her characters that truly live.  Bagoas is keenly intelligent, charming, courtly, sarcastic, prey to jealousy and possessiveness when it comes to his lover; his growing maturity merely adds to the pain he experiences as the affair and Alexander's conquests progress.  And Alexander is much more accessible here than in \\"Fire From Heaven,\\" which is a wonderful book but presents Alexander as all light and no fire.  Here we get to see Alexander as preening boy, heroic warrior, pragmatic king, and devoted lover.  It is a marvelous love story whether or not it actually happened.<br />But the emotional payoffs of the affair are balanced by hideous tragedies, none more affecting than the death of Hephaistion.  Bagoas' quiet desperation to keep Alexander with the sane and living is agonizing with the knowledge that Alexander did not survive his lover by more than three months.  Renault foreshadows without laying it on too thick, but it's worth noting that the portents of Alexander's death were recorded by historians, and the ancients paid close attention to that sort of thing.  The final quarter of the book is grim, with only a few moments of light, and the most poignant moment is when Bagoas, having kept watch over Alexander even after his death, finally gives way to the Egyptian priests who come to embalm the Macedonian.<br />It isn't all romance and grief.  Bagoas is, after all, only sixteen when the affair starts; he's prey to insecurity about his place in Alexander's heart, and his two antagonists are Hephaistion, Alexander's lifelong love, and Roxane, the legendary beauty who becomes Alexander's wife.  With Hephaistion, Bagoas indulges in the sort of reverie that anyone who's ever had a romantic rival can identify with (stopping short of cutting him into little pieces and feeding him to the dogs).  Roxane, onthe other hand, earns Bagoas' hatred for good reason, and she is presented as everything Hephaistion isn't:  clinging, vindictive, and devouring.  Bagoas wryly notes that Alexander has, like most men, married a woman like his mother, and it's asides like this from him that make the story such an indulgent treat to read.<br />Like other reviewers, I will say that if you despise homosexuality and homosexuals, don't pick up the book.  But if you can put aside prejudices and read for the sheer pleasure of encountering excellence in writing and losing yourself in another place and time, \\"The Persian Boy\\" is still in print.the other hand, earns Bagoas' hatred for good reason, and she is presented as everything Hephaistion isn't:  clinging, vindictive, and devouring.

Books	1	6	20	N	N	Silly &quot;Glory&quot;, no &quot;Lightning&quot;	Taylor Caldwell's &quot;Glory and the Lightning&quot; is the tale of Pericles and Aspasia.  It's the only telling I've found of the two, but there may be others.  Caldwell bored me so silly with this that I haven't bothered finding anything else on them.<br />&quot;Glory&quot; is the perfect example of what not to do in a novel.  Caldwell's Aspasia is a paragon of womanhood; she's wise, understanding, beautiful . . . she might as well be toast.  She encounters first a Persian nobleman, equipped with all the sinister henchmen and servants money can buy (I have never cringed while reading a book, but after encountering the eunuch guard, I could not read any passage he was mentioned in).  After fleeing his household, Aspasia turns up in Athens.  She meets Pericles, a man who is searching for the perfect woman, the woman of his dreams, and of course Aspasia is it.<br />Now the historical Pericles was a paragon, an upstanding man whose only fault was his affair with Aspasia.  Caldwell follows that description to the letter, and unfortunately her Pericles is about as interesting as toast crumbs.  He never fails to meet a challenge; his enemies are presented as so slight and one-dimensional in their hatred of him that his triumph is assured the moment he opens his mouth.  His romance with Aspasia is the stuff dreams are made of . . . if your dreams are fueled by Harlequin.<br />Caldwell wrote some entertaining books, but if you're after historical romance with teeth (and intelligence), look harder.  This is silly stuff; it is high-school devotional folly dressed up in costume, and the historical stuff is trotted out solely for decoration.	2002-07-11

The title has the unfortunate punch of a spy novel.  But for those who've read it . . . again and again, \\"The King Must Die\\" is the best of Mary Renault's novels of ancient Greece, and the best account of the Theseus myth.<br />Extensive research and exquisite talent combine in recreating Bronze Age Greece, down to the women's spangled skirts and the atmosphere in the smaller Greek cities.  Theseus himself springs forward from the first page, a boy of reckless courage and pride whose belief that he is the son of a god is coupled with an intuition of coming earthquakes.  When his parentage is revealed to be human, Theseus sets off to find his father--and Renault takes us deep into ancient spirituality and the forms of king and queenship.<br />From the first we understand that Theseus' people believed not in the divine right of kings, but the divinely-ordained duties of kings; the title is taken from the concept that a king might be called at any time to lay down his life for his people, or else lose his right to rule.  The society Theseus moves in has not yet moved completely away from matriarchies, but is not entirely patriarchal either.  Women hold power and no matter who the woman is, she is a presence, from Aithra (Theseus' mother) to Ariadne (the princess of Krete).<br />Nor are all the men chauvinistic boors, a fatal flaw in more than a few recent historical novels (at least those seeking to show the ancient world from a woman's point of view).  From Theseus' grandfather Pittheus to Minos of Crete, the men of \\"The King Must Die\\" are by turns honorable, lust-driven, wise and attuned to the demands of the societies they live in.  They are all flawed--there are no stainless heroes here, only fully-rounded characters with complex natures and needs.  The only flat villain is Asterion, Minos' heir, but through Renault's power of description he has a strong presence for what time he appears in the book.<br />The style is perfect.  Renault wastes no words, and every scene fits together seamlessly.  Characters, even the flat ones, evoke response from the reader; the narrative voice never veers into anachronisms, nor loses that sense that Theseus is there at your shoulder, telling you his story.

I don't mean that he writes without regard for style or characterization, although that's true too.  Leckie is an inaccurate writer, and while historical fiction is by its definition supposed to take liberties with the truth, it should at least stick to some basics.  Or as the writer Harry Turtledove has said:  Choose the lie you're going to tell, and then make your readers believe it.<br />It's impossible to believe when the style is reminiscent of some Cecil B. DeMille Biblical blockbuster, and the pages are riddled with outright thefts from other authors (yes, in Chapter 7, Leckie lifts whole an entire passage from Mary Renault's \\"Fire From Heaven,\\" which made me laugh so hard at what publishers seem determined to miss in order to sell ANYTHING).  And frankly, Leckie's Hannibal commits the cardinal sin:  he is boring.

His skillful writing helps him to pull this all off, but \\"Angel\\" asks two questions key to the mystery:  Why do we assume that women are nurturers and men are not?  And how damaging is this assumption not only to society but to individual men and women?<br />The villain is Libby Hatch, a woman with a string of catastrophes behind her, who kidnaps the daughter of a Spanish diplomat in the turbulent time preceding what will become the Spanish-American War.  The desperate mother, denied help by her husband, seeks the services of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, the \\"alienist\\" who has aroused the support and antagonism of so many authority figures in New York for his work with troubled children.  Kreizler himself is in political hot water:  an accident at the institute he runs has resulted in an investigation into his workings there, and he himself is prohibited from setting foot in the place for sixty days.<br />That gives him plenty of time to head the search for baby Ana, and I can't reveal more of the story without having to unravel the entire plot.  Suffice to say that all of the original characters from \\"The Alienist\\" return, and this time the story is told from the viewpoint of Stevie Taggert, Kreizler's 13-year-old ward.<br />Carr does bring the dives and slums of New York to life; you can almost taste the noxious concoctions served up at the child-bars and brothels (buttered rum, cocaine shavings and benzene should have killed its consumers well within a year) as well as smell the odors (Hickie's flat, crammed with animals, made me gag just to think of it).  But all of it is delivered in a pseudo-dialect that is just ungrammatical enough to sound like a poorly-educated adolescent.  To be fair, it's a good \\"voice\\" and it enhances Stevie's credibility.  But for myself, I found reading \\"Angel\\" a second and third time harder because I kept noticing the dialect instead of the story.<br />The story will sound more than familiar to fans of true crime, particularly the Diane Downs case.  That doesn't make it any less chilling.  Nor does Carr let the reader forget his central premise of wrongful assumptions and spiritual damage.  At points in the book, it feels as if the author wants to pound it into his readers' heads with a sledgehammer.  But what truly makes this story work is Libby Hatch herself, a woman capable of extremes that will take your breath away.  Carr does her a disservice by the cliched mode of her death--but Libby is a standout villain, someone who is neither entirely evil nor as good as she'd like others to think.<br />If you're at all interested in Diane Downs, whose actions helped to inspire Carr's novel, I recommend Ann Rule's \\"Small Sacrifices\\" to read in tandem with \\"The Angel of Darkness.\\"  You will not regret the experience.credibility.

William Kotzwinkle is a fine satirist, and he takes on the modern-day vivisectionists with a irony dipped in acid.  \\"Dr. Rat\\" doesn't aim solely to educate; it wants to crucify the sadistic, paper-pushing subculture it illuminates.<br />Dr. Rat, the protagonist, is indeed a rat, an inhabitant of the lab where hideous experimentations take place.  (I'm waiting for someone to explain for me what medical need is served by sucking living rats' brains out through a pneumatic tube).  Dr. Rat is charming in his sadistic way.  \\"Having been driven insane,\\" he notes early in the book, \\"I hold the necessary degree in psychology.\\"  It's impossible not to laugh even as you snarl while reading about the animals who are experimented upon in the name of \\"science\\".  There are many scientific studies done upon animals that have been worthwhile.  The ones portrayed in \\"Dr. Rat\\" are done for two reasons:  to satisfy morbid urges and to earn tons of grant money.<br />Interspersed with Dr. Rat's cheerfully malicious, decadently delicious narrative (rhymed deliberately, as it's one of his favorite things to do) are chapters told from the viewpoints of animals in different places.  Chickens describe the nightless environment that forces them to lay eggs eternally before their throats are cut.  Zoo animals suffer the torment of space too close to move in and the constant crush of gawkers.  Even animals out in their own environment start moving towards a meeting place to begin a revolt against mankind's indifference and abuse of the environment.  And that's where Kotzwinkle's weakest point is.  The savage satire becomes a gooey, Hallmarky, \\"Born Free\\"-style ode to the fate of animals and nature.<br />Kotzwinkle wants to tie the experimental community's indifference to the suffering they cause lab animals to the general devastation caused to the environment, and it really doesn't work.  For one thing, Kotzwinkle takes a \\"noble savage\\" viewpoint of the animals--they aren't really animals, they're humans beings with four or more legs, wings, fur, scales, etc., in tune with the Earth and other creatures.  And to really satirize every single cause of environmental destruction, Kotzwinkle would have had to write a series, not one book.  Kotzwinkle should have separated the topics--Dr. Rat and his lab victims go in one book; the Animal Kingdom revolts in another.<br />The mix never quite gels.  The Animal Kingdom sections are overwritten and overwrought.  There are a few scenes that evoke visceral reactions (the fate of the snake always makes me shudder), and there were some that brought a tear to my eye.  But I cry at Kodak commercials, and the reaction of humans to the animal revolution is so unrealistic that it can't be believed.  After I read \\"Dr. Rat\\" a second time, I began skipping the Animal Kingdom sections to get to the wonderful observations of Rat.  The ending of the Rat-narrated story is also unrealistic, but as the tone never wavers from satire (unlike the Animal Kingdom, which is so earnest you could cry . . . from boredom), it's easier to get lost in and believe.<br />In the end, we're left with the forlorn spectre of Dr. Rat, all alone, and the wail of academics who've realized that they're completely done in.  It's hard not to laugh at their obtuseness, even as you're gasping at the wholesale destruction Rat has waged in the lab.

I discovered Mary Renault in my sophomore year.  Guess which author's earned more of my appreciation and respect . . . and if you guess Caldwell, I will have to entreat you to read Renault.  Please.<br />That's not to say that Caldwell wasn't entertaining, and her view of history offers an alternative perspective.  But she could not resist showing us her interpretations of famous people through her dark glasses of right-wing American politics and Christianity.  \\"A Pillar of Iron\\" is no exception; its very title comes from the Book of Jeremiah.<br />Caldwell presents Cicero's birth and childhood as the appearance of a grand prodigy; whether any of it is based on fact (aside from the fact that the Cicerones did move to Rome from Arpinum to give the young Cicero a good education) is something for which I've never found proof.  His young life and career veers into Caldwell's apparent foundation that Marcus Cicero was Rome's first spiritual Christian.  (Marcus Cicero is probably still laughing his head off at that one).  She glosses over Cicero's greatest faults, namely his immense egotism and his timidity; she presents him as the heroic defender of the Republic during the Catilinian conspiracy, but sees nothing wrong with the fact that he denied those conspirators executed at Rome the right to a trial; and she resolutely turns every opponent he has into a villain.  Although her portrayal of Catiline is over-the-top fun--let's face it, people have loved mad, bad, beautiful people since the dawn of time--Caldwell can't make anyone else equally entertaining.  Julius Caesar especially suffers, shown as one-dimensional and annoying, the sort of politician and public presence who in Rome would have been laughed out of Italy, not opposed by some of the mightiest men Rome had produced.<br />One figure that keeps popping up (so to speak) is the \\"Unknown God\\", Caldwell's milking of an altar in Greece dedicated to, well, an unknown god; her decision to make that god Jehovah was hers to make.  I can't say I agree with it, but who knows?  It might have worked if Caldwell hadn't laid it on so thick.  After a while it palls.  The Romans were religious expedients; they prayed to different gods to cover all the bases.  Monotheism wasn't something they agreed with; they may have referred to a single god in later writings, but it's a good bet they had a particular deity from the pantheon in mind.<br />\\"A Pillar of Iron\\" is an interesting way to pass the time, but it's riddled with inaccuracies down to its tiniest conceit.

Colleen McCullough has done a fine job of recreating the Roman world in her &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series, but her flaws show in &quot;Fortune's Favorites.&quot;  More on those later.  For those expecting the rich characterization of &quot;The First Man in Rome&quot; or the emotional punch of &quot;The Grass Crown&quot;:  You're going to be disappointed.<br />McCullough truncates the civil war between consuls Carbo, Cinna and Sulla to the final few months, but what she gives us in return is meager.  Her portrayal of Sulla's last years is the book's biggest disappointment.  Part of Sulla's glamour is his incredible physical presence and charisma; by making him repulsive, she robs him of any attraction save for some rubber-necking curiosity over what new monstrosities he'll commit.  Sulla just doesn't connect here, which is a shame for a character who was vivid and alive in her previous two novels.  The only time he's enjoyable--when he isn't wreaking havoc in people's lives--is when he's playing off young Pompey's breathtaking self-centeredness.<br />(Breathtaking, by the way, is the word.  Wait until you read Pompey's letter to Sulla from Africa.  If you don't get the joke, just read Sulla's answer).<br />&quot;Fortune's Favorites&quot; jolts the reader back and forth between Pompey, young Julius Caesar, Quintus Sertorius, Spartacus, and Marcus Licinius Crassus.  While it is refreshing to see Crassus portrayed as a decent family man at heart (in spite of his greed), the other portrayals are disheartening.  Pompey was easily led, immature, fond of believing what his flatterers said about him, and willful, so McCullough hits the mark (even though her broad portrayal of him makes him seem clownish rather than charming).  And Sertorius retains some sympathy through his attachment to a particular white fawn.  But McCullough's bias for Caesar is undisguised, and some readers might find her portrayal of him to be too much of a &quot;superhero&quot; cast.  And her treatment of Spartacus is, in my opinion, implausible and unnecessary, unless her publisher told her to avoid any comparison with the Kirk Douglas film of the same name.  In that case, why not tell it completely from the Roman point of view?<br />For its flaws, &quot;Fortune's Favorites&quot; isn't all bad.  Some parts of it are entertaining; I refer to any encounter between Sulla and Pompey, and Sulla's dealings with the Senate.  Yet when it comes to her characters, McCullough fails to create solid, believable women;  while Aurelia remains McCullough's premier heroine in this series, no other woman comes close to her.  McCullough's women are just not as well-drawn and, often, not as interesting as her men--which is a shame.<br />McCullough has polished two flaws into glaring annoyances.  The first is her mastery of the information dump--whole pages of exposition litter &quot;Fortune's Favorites,&quot; with no relief in sight except to skip through the book and hope a conversation or a letter breaks out.  The second is her lavish use of anachronistic language throughout the book.  It's jarring and it breaks the flow of the story.<br />One final quibble:  Whoever commissioned the Harlequin-reject cover for the paperback edition should be forced to live in a room papered all over with the covers from Regency Line romances.  If nothing else, the nauseating presentation is a perfect reason to spend more money and buy the hardcover edition.tment of Spartacus is, in my opinion, implausible and unnecessary, unless her publisher told her to avoid any comparison with the Kirk Douglas film of the same name.

McCullough paints Sulla as, paradoxically, the invisible man--his peers support him for his high birth while knowing next to nothing about the man or his motives.  And Sulla keeps his secrets well, in spite of his attempts--and failures--to keep his darker impulses in check.  McCullough does an excellent job of portraying Sulla as a sociopath who manages to camouflage himself so well in civilized society.<br />Gaius Marius starts out strong in the beginning but swiftly goes downhill after suffering his second stroke during the War of the Allies, his mind and his ethics succumbing to his desire to fulfill the prophecy of his own greatness.  Caught in this desire are the fates of his son, his wife, and his nephew, a young boy named Gaius Julius Caesar.<br />The characters are better drawn here than in &quot;First Man&quot;; there is greater depth to people like Marcus Livius Drusus the reformer, Servilius Caepio, and Pompeius Strabo, but at least one, Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, suffers a softening (which is really too bad for fans of the feisty old man).  McCullough does a good job with the children as well--Servilia, Livia Drusa's neglected daughter, is a thoroughly unlikeable, but not completely unsympathetic character, and Young Sulla and his sister Cornelia are wonderful, spirited young people.<br />The end of this book is bloody, gruesome, and gives a sense of how horrific this period was for Rome, patrician and pleb alike.  The changes of fortune are swift and well-told, but McCullough can't resist long pages of barely-broken paragraphs and anachronistic language, even though she throws in a few more Latin phrases and expressions to make her dialogue more authentic.  Still, it's a faster and more exciting book than &quot;First Man,&quot; which is all to the good.nd anachronistic language, even though she throws in a few more Latin phrases and expressions to make her dialogue more authentic.

For those who haven't studied Roman history, this is the original conflict:  Rome, corrupted by the influx of wealth after the Punic Wars, is threatened by the rebellious king Jugurtha of Numidia and the barbaric Germans to the north, and lacks men of birth and ability to meet the challenge until Gaius Marius steps forth.<br />And who is Gaius Marius?  Colleen McCullough repeats the phrase often enough so that everyone gets it:  an Italian hayseed with no Greek.  In short, a farmer's son born in Arpinum, not a Roman, not of the accepted families, with no noteworthy ancestors, who has made his own reputation.  His success against Jugurtha wins him the adoration of the Roman people and enemies among the Senate, most notably Metellus Numidicus and Marcus Aemilius Scaurus.  He also gains a partner in his ventures:  a young, dissolute aristocrat named Lucius Cornelius Sulla, a fair-faced, chameleon-like charmer who has his share of skeletons to hide.<br />McCullough manages to keep several plots going without dropping the thread, which is whether or not they all agree about Gaius Marius and his incredible defense of Rome.  The relationship between Marius and Julia of the Caesars, which gives him the social standing he needs to become consul, is portrayed as the ideal Roman marriage--and so it may be a little dull for readers expecting flash and passion.  But the marriage between Sulla and Julia's sister Julilla is a match made in hell, and it provides some wonderful confrontations.  McCullough introduces us to up-and-comers Marcus Livius Drusus, Quintus Sertorius, and Quintus Servilius Caepio; although Sertorius is briefly shown, we see a great deal of Drusus and Caepio--enough to make their characters clear.  As for the women, McCullough does a fine job of making them as interesting as the men (although some will chafe at the immaturity of Livia Drusa and Julilla)--and with Aurelia, the mother of the future Gaius Julius Caesar, she creates her best heroine so far.<br />McCullough depicts great battles (Arausio unfolds like an inescapable nightmare) and political brawls with skill, although she litters her narrative with anachronisms, and her dialogue occasionally falls flat.  The last sentence of the novel is a clumsy attempt to tell a pertinent truth about a character using a blatantly obvious metaphor.  But McCullough isn't out to win any awards for pretty writing; she set out to tell a complicated, intriguing story about power and its unintended consequences in a time and place relevant to our history and succeeded.<br />For those who are overwhelmed by the sheer number of characters and unknown Latin terms in the book, McCullough thoughtfully provides a glossary and a character list.

I bought \\"When Christ and His Saints Slept\\" because I'd finished her Welsh Trilogy (that should be, Welsh Tragedy) and thought, \\"Oh, joy!  Another big, thick Penman novel!\\"<br />Sometimes I shouldn't think.  If I had, I wouldn't have paid [money] for this book; I'd have borrowed it from the library.<br />I don't regret buying it.  On the contrary--Penman's worst is many other authors' best; why should I be upset?  \\"Slept\\" is still a fine novel.  But it's Penman's weakest effort; the conflict she chose to recreate is tepid compared to her earlier subjects.  The war between Stephen, Count of Blois, and Maude, daughter of the Plantagenet King, for the throne of England is a stirring story.  But Maude and Stephen rarely meet each other.  The story tells of the intrigues and escapes of Stephen, Maude and their supporters; it also gives a glimpse into what a hell a marriage could be in medieval times, in the form of Maude's hateful union with Geoffrey of Anjou.  Every time Geoffrey and Maude appeared in the same scene, I kept wishing Maude would shove a poker through Geoffrey's eye.  But . . .<br />Aside from a subplot involving Ranulf, Maude's younger brother, and his romances with a young noblewoman and his Welsh cousin (the flattest character Penman has ever created), nothing really happens.  Maude's son Henry is somewhat interesting, but not enough to make one believe that this is Henry II, the husband of the legendary Eleanor of Aquitaine.  And after meeting Eleanor in \\"Here Be Dragons\\", Penman's far-superior romance, coming across her younger self in \\"Slept\\" is a keen disappointment.  In her earlier works, Penman created wonderful pairs:  Llewellyn and Joanna, Simon and Nell, Richard and Anne.  Henry and Eleanor, perhaps the most infamous lovers/marrieds of the Middle Ages, are as bland as a Plaidy couple.<br />Still, Penman gets you lost in her recreated world, and if you enjoyed her earlier work, you'll like this as well.

The last in Sharon Kay Penman's \\"Welsh Trilogy\\" (or \\"Welsh Tragedy\\"; take your pick), it concerns Edward II's conquest of Wales and the end of the Montfort family.  And in Penman's perfect, profound prose, it etches the portrait of Edward in acid.  Great he might have been to his peers, but here he is shown as a larger-than-life bully, intolerant, expedient in regards to his own wishes, and cruel.<br />You can tell where Penman's sympathies lie.  Llewellyn, grandson of Llewellyn Fawr, fights to keep the English yoke off Wales, only to find himself tripped up time and again by betrayal--from his brother Daffyd, a charming liar who could probably talk his way out of Hell; from other Welsh lords; from Edward himself, who denies him his bride, Ellen Montfort, until he's certain that he's brought Llewellyn to heel.  Ellen, perhaps the only Montfort who has a truly happy life, does indeed marry Llewellyn, and their marriage is the only weak part of this story--it has the feel of \\"Llewellyn and Joanna Redux.\\"  Only Ellen is not half as enchanting as Joanna.  She does come close to being just as infuriating.<br />Penman's pace is at its fastest in \\"The Reckoning.\\"  Small wonder.  The tragedies and defeats pile up until the climax, and the outcry at the end of the world as the Welsh know it is heartbreaking.  Llewellyn is not the man his grandfather was, but he is heroic in the face of certain defeat.  Determined not to go down without a fight, driven by a love of his people and homeland, Llewellyn is a character to cheer and to mourn for.<br />Daffyd, on the other hand, is a man you'd like to strangle, the sweet-tongued bastard who seems to slip past punishment no matter how much he deserves it.  And yet his marriage to Elizabeth, Edward's ward, is an amusing surprise.  He too shows his worth in the end, finding his own strength in the shadow of death.  This is how \\"Braveheart\\" should have ended.<br />As for Edward . . . after finishing \\"The Reckoning,\\" I went to see \\"Braveheart\\" and cheered when Isabelle whispered to the old man that his line would die with his feckless son.

It takes a character from history, King John's illegitimate daughter Joanna, and recreates her with such skill that the woman comes alive on the pages.  It brings to life twelfth-century England and Wales so well that every page just takes you deeper into the past.<br />Joanna's childhood is miserable until she is brought to her father John, then only a count and bitterly envious of his brother Richard the Lionheart.  John is an excellent father, but also a good politician.  Needing an alliance with unruly Wales, he betroths his young daughter to Llewellyn, Prince of Gwynedd.  Joanna is horrified; all she knows of Wales is that the people are considered barbarians.  Her first meeting with Llewellyn, on their wedding day, would have ruined their married life if not for the fact that her husband is a kind man and sensitive to her unease.<br />In fact, Llewellyn is the most sympathetic male character I've encountered in a historical romance who wasn't also completely unbelievable.  Llewellyn doesn't shower his bride with flowers, or court her into bed--but their marriage is consummated after the funniest display of jealousy you'll find in a novel.  (Poor Joanna, is all I can say).  A leader of men, Llewellyn fights to unite Wales against England, and constantly battles John for his country's independence.  The battle between father and husband tears at Joanna's loyalties, which Penman describes with skill; at no time does she hint that Llewellyn is going to win Joanna over completely, or that John won't have a greater hold on Joanna's heart.<br />The other family battle is between Joanna and Llewellyn's oldest son Gruffydd, who hates his father's wife as deeply as he loves his father--and even that is poisoned by his jealousy of their closeness.  Gruffydd and Joanna are bitter enemies; Joanna's maneuvering of the uncontrollable Gruffydd is damnable save for the fact that she acts for her own son Dafydd's safety.  (Brothers were traditional antagonists in Welsh history).  Of course their hatred almost destroys them both:  Gruffydd ends up in exile after Joanna tricks him into an explosive rage, and his wife Senena springs a trap on Joanna that nearly costs her Llewellyn for good.<br />This story is incredible, not only for Penman's rich telling of it, but also for the event that threatens Joanna's marriage.  I did dislike Penman's handling of Joanna's reasons for committing infidelity . . . but the scene of Joanna and Llewellyn's reconciliation is too powerful to argue with.<br />It's too bad you can't find this book in hardback, but the trade paperback is nicely done.  Perhaps Penman might persuade her publisher to find some new cover artwork--a portrait of Llewellyn Fawr and Joanna on the front would spike sales of this book even higher.

I also discovered Sharon Kay Penman's novels, but didn't read &quot;The Sunne In Splendour&quot; until 1995.<br />&quot;The Sunne In Splendour&quot; tells of the War of the Roses, the dynastic struggle between the Lancaster and York branches of the Plantagenet family for the throne of England.  It is the story of Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester, who became Richard III, was overthrown by Henry Tudor, and subsequently slandered so viciously that it took hundreds of years for scholars to even consider he might have been a better man than history portrayed him to be.  Penman's novel follows Richard from childhood to grave, a life with so few joys and so many sorrows that it seems a mercy that Richard died in his early 30s.<br />No monster--portraits show him to be a rather handsome, if tight-featured man--Richard was also no saint; Penman's tale shows his self-righteousness, his acerbic tongue, his blind loyalty to his brother Edward, the King who was known as &quot;the Sunne in Splendour&quot; not only for his incredible looks and charisma, but for the battle that won him his crown at 19.  Penman uses multiple points of view, necessary in this story, to tell Richard's tale.  Her characters are, for the most part, vivid and interesting, and even her flat characters evoke some response in the reader.  Although Penman's book is lengthy (a real doorstopper of a novel), her prose enchants; the dialogue never rings false, her characters never put a foot wrong (unless they're supposed to), and the pace unrolls like a grand tapestry, full of color, light and shadows.<br />Penman's style is poetic, but she's fond of long paragraphs that nearly topple chapters beneath their weight.  This was the first of her Plantagenet novels, and it shows when compared to &quot;Falls The Shadow&quot; or &quot;The Reckoning.&quot;  It could have used a little more editing, some tightening, a little breaking up of those hefty paragraphs to speed up the pace.  Not that the story slips away the moment you close the book; Penman's skill is such that you may find yourself recalling scenes in vivid detail weeks, even months later.<br />If your knowledge of Richard III comes from Shakespeare, or even the most recent movie with Ian McKellen, do yourself a favor and read an opposing viewpoint.  Whichever version of Richard you prefer, you will come away with an enduring love of this book.htening, a little breaking up of those hefty paragraphs to speed up the pace.

There's enough humor to counter the grief and anger the family carried over the loss of Eleni, but it's Gage's account of his mistrust and resentment of his father that is the focus of this story.  Long before Gage can seek justice for his mother's killing, he has to forgive his father, who turns out to be a better man than his son expects.<br />If this story is gentler in tone and pace than \\"Eleni\\"--albeit just as well-written, and spare in its language--it is because this is a story of healing rather than revenge.  This is Christos's story rather than Nicholas's; the son's grief found a release in the search for those responsible for his mother's death, while the father devoted his life to the care of their children.  Through that devotion, the Gatzoyiannis children came to thrive in their new country, finding purpose and strength.<br />In the end Christos and Eleni are reunited--their graves are side by side, and the epitaph speaks simply of the lifelong love between the two.  A lesson for the family is made a lesson for all of us.	2002-04-22

Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, and I can't wait for the next one.  A word to all publishers, though:  You would sell more hardcover copies if you'd consider lowering the price.  I had to wait a year until I could spare the [money] for a chunk of paper and cardboard.<br />That aside . . . Martin writes the grittiest fantasy I've read that doesn't turn me off the characters completely.  Then again, his characters are human despite their flaws--they strike a chord of recognition, a wish to know them or a prayer that they'll get what they deserve.  The situation is also quite realistic--the devastation of war and the intrigues for power are well done, and Martin's quick, to-the-mark prose doesn't hurt at all.<br />Yes, the book is long; yes, it'll take time to get through it (six hours for me).  It's also another transitionary book.  But with the scope Martin's planning, with as many characters as he has, \\"Storm\\" has to be a transition.  And it's fantastic.  While Catelyn and Robb meet a fate no one could have predicted, Arya becomes as hardened and cruel as the monsters she escaped (I hope this poor child will have someone to ~talk~ to in the end); Jon Snow's time among the wildlings is heartbreaking, but in the end he confronts himself and his place in the world.  Joffrey and Stannis take different directions in the success of their reigns.  And Daenerys . . . ah, Daenerys.  My favorite female character in the series, Dany exhibits a compassion at odds with an ability to use people like no other.  If you aren't cheering after the scene in the Place of Punishment, you haven't been paying much attention.<br />I wanted to give this three stars because it's tragic and I honestly felt ready for Prozac when I was finished.  Then I tried going to sleep after finishing what has to be the creepiest epilogue in modern fantasy.  Do yourself a favor.  Before finishing \\"Storm\\", make sure it's daylight.

Let&#8217;s try &#8220;A Game Of Thrones.&#8221;<br />Having read more of George R.R. Martin&#8217;s work than this series, I must apologize for inferring he has no love of language.  That&#8217;s not true.  The man can write; he&#8217;s written more novels than this one, and he is versatile.  Therefore, I&#8217;m taking &#8220;A Clash of Kings&#8221; on its own merits.  (Word of support:  Martin is no Jordan/Tolkien clone.)<br />&#8220;Clash&#8221; introduces the Usurper Robert Baratheon&#8217;s brother Stannis, a contender for the Iron Throne, his brother Renly, and a priestess named Melisandre, who is perhaps the most frightening of any character Martin&#8217;s created so far.  Martin does a good job of setting up opposing characters whose differences aren&#8217;t obnoxiously obvious; Stannis is grim for solid reasons, whereas Renly exudes the confidence of someone who has been loved all his life.  (And by whom should be obvious to the reader&#8212;but I won&#8217;t give anything away).  The Lannisters are digging in, with Tyrion the Imp taking the reins at King&#8217;s Landing; Robb Stark has seized the North; Daenerys continues her quest for ships and armies with which to retake her kingdom; and Jon Snow finds a threat beyond the Wall that could make the war for the Iron Throne look like child&#8217;s play.<br />The battle scenes are done well&#8212;the Battle of the Blackwater is a fine one&#8212;and the characters are beginning to evolve from the original sketchiness of &#8220;Thrones&#8221;.  Tyrion is so clearly the smartest&#8212;and the best&#8212;member of the Lannisters, it&#8217;s hard not to root for the whole family to be washed out to sea and leave him in charge.  Cersei is revealed as a woman of drive, ambition and energy smothered in her forced role of docile mother and wife&#8212;albeit it&#8217;s hard to sympathize, as this woman condoned the attempted murder of a child who witnessed her in an incestuous embrace&#8212;while Sansa simply becomes more hopeless and pitiful.  A possible reason why the Stark children found the direwolves is made clear near the end of the book.  And if anyone wanted someone else to despise besides Joffrey, Theon Greyjoy steps up with his ambition to earn glory for himself by destroying the Starks.<br />I have complaints, but it&#8217;s nothing that probably won&#8217;t be taken care of in the following sequels.  Arya becomes more repellent and aimless with every chapter.  Bran&#8217;s fate in &#8220;Clash&#8221; is the most exciting thing to happen to him in the series so far.  I wish someone would club Joffrey and drop him down the sewers, and I really wish Catelyn Stark would either go home or get ambushed.

Martin has been feted as Tolkien's successor in TIME Magazine and in newspapers, heralded by his fans as being better than Robert Jordan, and all the accolades inspired a jaundiced attitude in me as I read \\"A Game Of Thrones.\\"  I will say this:  it's nowhere as bad as anything by Jordan or David Eddings, both of whom write on a 7th-grade level with flat characters.  I couldn't finish either of the novels I started that were written by the forenamed authors.  But I finished \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" and look forward to the rest of Martin's series.<br />Why, because the man's press is true?  Well, no, it isn't.  Martin is better than Jordan and Eddings, but that's like comparing the junior high valedictorian to the rest of his class.  His writing is brisk, gets the story moving, flows well; it's also pedestrian, and I doubt there are any phrases that'll stick to mind when I'm finished with his series.  He doesn't seem to have much love or regard for language.<br />So is he Tolkien's heir in spite of this?  No, because, in spite of the fact that Tolkien's language is antique and often overdone, Tolkien was a master at worldbuilding.  Most Tolkien fans would love to find Middle-earth.  I wouldn't pay two cents for a stay in the Seven Kingdoms if I had dragons for bodyguards; it's a cold, unpleasant place.  But Martin brings it to life, which makes him a superior storyteller to Eddings, Jordan and company.<br />Did I like the story?  Yes, in spite of the fact that it's a retelling of the Wars of the Roses.  I rather suspect I know who'll win in the end.  I've gotten attached to certain characters-Jon, Bran, Arya, Tyrion, Daenerys, Sandor Clegane and, oddly, Loras Tyrell-and hate others (Cersei, Catelyn, Sansa, Gregor Clegane, Janos Slynt, almost anybody named Lannister or connected to them, Alliser Thorne).  The language is blunt; so are the situations.  I'm grateful.  Enough fantasy is whitewashed and Disneyized; thank goodness Martin shows a medieval world so real you can smell the mud and garbage as well as the flowers and spices.<br />\\"Song of Ice And Fire\\" is not a masterwork, but it's a good read.  And it looks as if it will have a real conclusion.  I'll stick with it until I find something better or it ends.l you can smell the mud and garbage as well as the flowers and spices.<br />\\"Song of Ice And Fire\\" is not a masterwork, but it's a good read.

Eliot's &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;, an apt borrowing, as Penman's novel presents us with the hollowest of them all--Henry III--and Simon de Montfort as the man who opposes his empty-headedness to his own death.  Not that Eliot had Henry III in mind.  But Simon de Montfort's life was not a vain sacrifice.  Nor was he the stereotypical hero in shining armor.<br />Simon de Montfort was arrogant, domineering, cunning, and pragmatic; he was pious, occasionally self-righteous, and impatient with those who couldn't keep up with him.  That said, Penman breathes magnificent life into him, making him a man who follows his heart wherever it leads--and it leads him headlong into danger.  From seducing King Henry's sister Nell, who married him in spite of having vowed her life to chastity, to calling Henry an idiot who deserved to be incarcerated for the rest of his life, Simon gives in to emotion and impulse.  And yet he is a passionate husband to Nell, a loving father to his children, a loyal friend, and an implacable enemy to Henry III, a man who only became King through the accident of birth.<br />The book is long; the language is well-woven but rich rather than heavy.  If you can bear the ending (&quot;the murder of Evesham, for battle it was none&quot;), you will not be able to part with the book at all.	2001-08-07

I said yes; I love to read, and Bob Thomas was someone I admired.  If he said a book was worthwhile, then I knew it was.  \\"American Daughter Gone To War\\" has been with me ever since.<br />Winnie Smith's writing is straightforward.  Her account of her childhood and adolescence is as clear as her account of her tour in Vietnam, even when the horrors start mounting up; although Smith's narrative sometimes skimps on description, the reader should keep in mind that she's writing her memoirs, not a novel.  She shows a gallows humor throughout, particularly when she tells of dealing with arrogant doctors, officers, and (later) men who lie about having served in the war; she gives glimpses of the day-to-day life at the bases (tarantulas in the latrine are just one ordinary occurrence).  When I finished the book, I felt as if I'd spent the time actually speaking to Smith, sharing in her memories, and was just as emotionally wrung as if I had.<br />If all history is relative, a patchwork of accounts from witnesses in high and low places (as well as on the giving and taking ends of orders), then the American involvement in the Vietnam War is a kaleidoscope.  Of all the literary fragments worth piecing together, \\"American Daughter Gone To War,\\" although small, is one to keep.	2001-05-31

I haven't read a worthy depiction of their story until I bought and read Benita Kane Jaro's &quot;The Key.&quot;<br />Jaro's writing is elegant in its descriptions, beautifully paced; her scenes fire the imagination to recreate ancient Rome, Baiae, the lonely farmhouse where Caelius, Catullus' best friend, is forced to tell the story to Catullus' dying father.  He narrates the tale of how Catullus meets and falls in love with Clodia; how their affair inspires his finest work; how her infidelities and a betrayal from an unexpected source isolate and ultimately lead to a situation that, for the brilliant yet tormented poet, becomes unbearable.<br />The final pages are an odd combination, a slap in the face paired with the quiet touch of forgiveness, as Caelius comes to realize the encompassing nature of love (in all its pain, ugliness and power), and as Catullus comes to see that his love for Clodia is, to her, a trap from which she will do anything to escape.  It is exquisitely written, and &quot;The Key&quot; should be better known than it is so far.	2001-05-18

Even writing this, I'm using two Kleenexes and a free hand.<br />Frank Deford has my utmost respect for having survived Alex's death.  No parent who loses a child ever recovers; &quot;healing&quot; and &quot;closure&quot; are insipid terms that people who've never suffered that loss use to try to cope on behalf of friends or family.  Truth is, more couples separate over the death of a child than stay together.  Many parents withdraw into depression, or suicide, after the death of a child, especially a small one.<br />But instead of just surviving, which God knows he and his family were entitled to do, Frank Deford wrote this beautiful tribute to Alex.  It is marvelous.  Alex lives in this book, and when she dies there is a grace to Deford's prose that evokes the presence that used to be.  A sweet, stubborn, keenly intelligent and high-spirited little girl, Alex is a surprise on every page.  How could anyone have lived with a child that alert to her fate, and so determined to face it on her terms, and not gained strength from her?<br />I can't tell Alex's story better than her father did, so find the book and read it.  If the death of a child saddens you, then remember:  the book is not about her death, but her life and how she lived it.	2001-05-01

Well, &quot;The Praise Singer&quot; is beautifully written.  It is also too short.  On the one hand, I'm grateful she avoided the temptation to have Simonides' fingers in every political pie in pre-democratic Athens; on the other, I wish she'd fleshed the story out more.<br />The book is typical Renault:  exquisitely drawn characters (I will never forget her Anakreon) and lyrical language that moves you along (necessary, because there's not much of a plot).  But her retelling of the story of Harmodios and Aristogeiton (which feels like a random vignette, unfortunately) is flat compared to the downfall of Polykrates of Samos, which is told second-hand but still gave me chills to read.  The book is no epic, and it isn't one of her best historical novels, but if you like Renault's novels on ancient Greece, you will like &quot;The Praise Singer,&quot; faults and all.	2000-12-06

But Mr. Leckie's book is too short and too concerned with \\"analyzing\\" Scipio, vis-a-vis a supposed lean towards homosexuality.  (Not that the ancient Romans would have cared if Scipio slept with men, so long as he took the active role.)  Mr. Leckie spends no time creating a believable character; he builds no credible ties for Scipio to family or friends, and he doesn't even cover Scipio's rise to power in Rome as the great military leader and innovator that he was.  Pick up Livy; you'll see what I mean.<br />Oh, the atrocities.  Nothing you can't top by reading the newspaper.  The only thing that sticks out in my mind is an attempted rape of an old woman.

It is the most affecting, haunting tale I've ever read.  Alexander the Great has died; from the moment of his death, the cohesive force that was the Macedonian army is no more, and his generals, wife, and enemies fight for prominence--as well as a young woman unmentioned in Renault's previous novels.<br />Once again, Renault brings us deep into that time, so deep we can almost see each character before us; her writing is clear, yet layered in its concise, descriptory power.  There are no wasted words, anywhere.  The dialogue is direct and to the point; this tale is a much faster &quot;read&quot; than &quot;Fire From Heaven&quot; or &quot;The Persian Boy&quot;, but the adventures turn grim as the desire to take up Alexander's mantle overcomes nearly everyone he knew, favored, or despised.  Although luxuriously buried in the tomb of his beloved Hephaistion, Alexander is an unquiet spirit all through the book.  As Perdikkas, Philip Arrhidaios, Demetrius the One-Eyed, Ptolemy, Seleukos, and Kassandros vie for control of Macedonia and the remains of Alexander's empire--and of his legend--a granddaughter of Philip, Eurydike, steps forward to make her own claim for the throne.  Too, Roxane and Olympias take their places, one as mother of the dead king, the other as mother to his only living son.  Both women have blood on their hands; both women--in fact, nearly all the contestants--meet their end.  The only one left standing by the end of the story is the only man who leaves what was Alexander's alone:  his half-brother Ptolemy, who takes up the throne at Egypt and pays honor to Alexander there.<br />There is a brief mention of Bagoas, and his mourning is displayed with a gentle elegance, but neither of Alexander's wives are portrayed favorably.  Renault seems to have had a dislike of women in general, particularly ambitious ones.  Stateira, Alexander's Persian wife, is shown as a naive victim of Roxane's vindictive jealousy, and Roxane herself is so unpleasant that her fate evokes little besides a sense of justice done at last.  Eurydike, the young challenger, is almost patronized by the author.  Olympias, who was shown in &quot;Fire From Heaven&quot; as a smothering, damaging mother, is shown behaving in much the same way in &quot;Funeral Games&quot;, but her reaction to Alexander's death--and her own--is moving.<br />Some battle scenes are alluded to; Renault does not linger on gore and violence, probably because she knew that do so would be excessive, as deaths occur in every chapter.  This succession war is so bloody that it should come as no surprise that no one of Alexander's family or inner circle holds on to the Macedonian empire.  The betrayals and murders are numerous.  It is almost as if a curse claims each and every man (and woman) who attempts to follow Alexander to the throne.  Perhaps so?  It's hard not to wonder when the bodies start piling up, with the survivors being those who chose (for whatever reason) to stay out of the fight.<br />Finish the book, and the ghost remains with you for days.

It's hard not to wonder when the bodies start piling up, with the survivors being those who chose (for whatever reason) to stay out of the fight.<br />Finish the book, and the ghost remains with you for days.  Mary Renault was a conjurer without peer.	2000-10-05
