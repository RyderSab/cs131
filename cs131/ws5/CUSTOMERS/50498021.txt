For quite some time now, there have been three SW authors that I couldn't decide between as far as who was best:  Stackpole, Allston and Zahn.  Luceno has joined them.  Why?<br />he plot moves along at a nice pace.  I was kept on the edge of my seat for several chapters.<br />The action sequences are very well written.  Pulse pounding blaster battles and dogfight.  No lightsabres, however.  This book does fine without them though.<br />It's in te department of characters that Luceno really shines.  Han is the obvious star of this book and Luceno does a great job exploring him and his grief.  Luceno does a great job bringing back the Han of old and helping him grow.  Han's new friend is also well done.  I found myself laughing outloud at some of their exchanges, such as when they are flying in battle together.  Luke, Mara, Leia and Anakin are also close to the mark.  In what amounts to a cameo, Borsk is dead on as well.  <br />And speaking of cameos, Luceno knows his EU.  If you liked, Kapp Dendo showing up in Ruin, you will love this book.  Cameo after cameo.  One of my favorites is back, Showalter from the Corellian Trio.  I really enjoyed his plot.  Some of the best scenes involve 3PO.  It's amazing how Luceno gets inside his head. <br />I also learned a lot of new words from the book.  I liked that aspect of it.  Anybody know what gibbous means?  You will after you read this.  And read it you should.	2000-11-30

Not that there is anything wrong with that.   This book was mainly character development.  I liked it a lot. I've always been and ObiWan and a Tarkin fan.  OW sees a lot of growth in this book.<br />As far as plot goes, it was mainly relatively hard SF.  The best scenes were those with Tarkin and Seinar although I was intrigued by the mystery of the Pentotium and the Magister.  Bar really did a great thing here by developing everyone even Ke Daiv.  We see motivations, hidden desires and right into everyones thoughts.<br />The only real negative is that it might be a tad long.  But on the whole, this book delivers.  Kudos to Bear for bringing something new and different to SW.<br />Read it.	2000-11-28
US	50498021	R3UOIBJJ82FGJW	0671510126	412606618	The Good Earth (Enriched Classics)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Stunning	The Good Earth stands as one of the greatest books ever written.  Truly, Buck is excellent.  The Good Earth is first and foremost a book about life:  the good, the bad and all the rather mediocre.<br />The plot, such as it is, moves along at a relentess pace, letting us wander through life as it was in another place and time.  One literally feels the raw emotion radiating from the characters.  Before the book is done, you know them all like old friends.<br />Life is filled with ups and downs and so it is here.  One may be poor one moment and rich the next but beware, it can change again in an instant.  The sheer scope and power of this masterpiece makes one wish it would go on forever.<br />The closing scene is one of the most powerful and brilliant writings in literature anywhere.  The circle of life, the change, the growth.  This is what this book tells of.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It will always be with you.	2000-11-21

Mike Stackpole delivers with a whiz-bang in this spectacular two book set.  What is there to like about this book?  Everything.<br />Stackpole's plots are tight and well woven especially the Daeshara'cor subplot.<br />Action sequences are flawless as usual.  The battles on Garqui and Ithor are wonderfully done.  Mike has long wowed me with his space battles.  Now we know he has a similar affinity for lightsaber and blaster fights.<br />Cameos abound and there is some good character development.  Corran, Shedeo Shai, Ganner, and Elegos A'Kla are handled very nicely.  The conversations between Shai and his visitor are great and I really liked the way that plot ended.  Good to see Wedge and Tycho back.  Wedge didn't get much to do, but maybe some other author will pick him up. Kre'fey, Kyp, and Wurth show considerable promise.  I still love to hate Borsk.<br />In short, the only real negative about this book is that it is book two and not book three.  Yup, Siege was cancelled.  Now I guess I get over it.<br />I am feeling understandably nostalgic upon finishing this book.  I am actually enjoying the NJO.  New friends like Luceno, Denning, Salvatore and others are being introduced.  Old friends, like Stackpole, Allston and Tyers, still drop around.  Someone once said, &quot;Make new friends but keep the old.  One is silver, the others gold.&quot;  Goodbye, Mr. Stackpole, Mike, you were truly gold.	2000-11-16

Upon rereading this book some few years after I read it the first time, I found that the excitement had diminished not a whit.  Dark Force Rising is my personal favorite from this trilogy.  <br />Some great characterization as regards Lando, Han, Luke, Leia, Wedge, Borsk, Thrawn, CBaoth, Karrde, Aves and Mara.  Zahn also introduces some new characters:  Bel Iblis, Sena and such.  Delta Source is still a mystery.<br />Good to see Wedge and the Rogues again, by the way.  I enjoyed Han and Lando's adventures.  The last four chapters are stupendous.  The battle for the Katana fleet is terrific.  The twist at the end is great and I really enjoyed the confrontation between Leia and Fey'lya during the battle.  <br />All in all, Zahn is part of a very select group of the really great SW authors out there.  He ranks with Stackpole, Allston, Perry and Tyers as the very best of the best.  Anderson, Wolverton, Salvatore, Rusch, Smith and a few others get an honorable mention.	2000-11-14

Therefore, I was rather looking forward to the sequel.  It is soo bad.  Want to know why?<br />Usually, SW authors have some basis for the names they come up with.  But when Han says something about a flesh-eating vlrbrth, I think that is about what it said, I just go the picturer of an author hitting the keyboard and taking what he got.  The Dark Side adepts made me think of the Keystone Kops, bumbling about and getting sliced up.  Dare I say anything about Ood the Jedi.  I almost laughed out loud.  Dead Imperial flying ace brains in droids.  Good Gravy.  Although King Brand was the most idiotic character ever created.  I just bowed my head in disbelief when he floated out to meet our heroes.<br />So, why two whole stars.  Because the art was great.  Especially the battles on Ossus and Byss.  New Alderaan was also well done.  The shot of the Galaxy Gun and it's effect on a planet whose name I will not give was stupendous.  I also enjoyed the plot involving Han and Fett.  Although, what is this junk about Fett being a former stormtrooper who murdered his CO.  What about Jaster Mereel.  Oh, well both ideas will probably be shot down by Ep. II anyway.<br />Best Line:  &quot;Let go of my jet pack, ya animal.&quot;  &quot;Ya.&quot;  Fett always seemed pretty grammatical to me.  Guess not.	2000-11-07

Salvatore didn't do his homework for this book and so there are a few minor errors in continuity.  Bolphur the Noghri made me snicker a bit.  There were others but in my opinion they are all pretty minor.<br />Positives: 1.  Han and Chewie are like they are suppposed to be.  Chewie actually has a personality in this book.  For the first time since Tyrant's Test we see a glimpse of what the walking carpet is thinking.  The scene of Han and Chewie running the belt is hysterical.  I laughed out loud, something no Star Wars book except for Allston and Wolverton has made me do.  <br />2.  I am warming slightly to Anakin.  He isn't like he has been in previous books and I count that a good thing.  He seems to be maturing.  Kyp Durron was also likeable.  And you cannot appreciate the miracle it took for me to find this horrible Anderson creation likeable.  He seems to have finally got over his fall to the Dark Side.  Nice to see Nom Anor again.  Can't wait to see more of Wurth Skidder.  In my opinion, Lando wasn't that far off.  I have an uncle that reminds me of Lando.  He is never going to mature.  He is in an endless cycle of maturing and having second childhoods.  That is the way Lando is too.<br />3.  Salvatore is one of the better action writers around.  His battle sequences never failed to deliver.  I was kept on the edge of my seat through Jacen's journey to the planet and the space battle going on.  Miko Reglia's battle with the Vong and Mara's fight with Yomin Carr were both standout fantastic.<br />4.  I liked way Salvatore actually kept all the principles together and in the dark for the first little bit.  <br />So, as far as I can see, Vector Prime is good in humor, character, plot and action.  A good book.  And it is worth reading just for chapter 26.  Stunning and realistic.  Oh and if you haven't read this book, there are major spoilers in the reviews below.  Just thought I'd warn you.	2000-10-24

Van Weyden and Larsen come to grips with eachother and with themselves in this book.  The confrontation scenes between the two are amazingly written and the stark realism of the boat, it's crew and the violence that is almost an everyday occurence combine to make this a book that can not be put down.<br />The introduction of the female slows the book considerably but in my honest opinion, the ending is fine.  Larsen's final fate is surprising and heart rending.  The repeated phrase &quot;Bosh&quot; leads to one of the books best moments.  While I wish London hadn't included the female, the book is well worth the read.  At least before the female comes in, the book is darkly violent and challenging.  The social implications of the debates between Van Weyden and Larsen are extremely sobering.  All in all, this book is one of the best I have ever read.  Brilliant is the best word I can come up with.	2000-09-28

It was okay.  Some parts were so unintentionally funny I laughed out loud.  (I did like the part where they try to handcuff the one armed man.  Ha ha ha.  Page's commandos rock! )<br />I wondered how Anderson planned to pull off another Death Star without it being strictly by the numbers.  I found out that he put the greatest weapon in the galaxy in the hands of the Dilbert, Alice, Wally and the Pointy-haired (pointy-headtailed? ) boss of the Star Wars Galaxy.<br />Luke also was reduced to acting very stupid in this novel.  Let's look at some scenes, shall we?<br />Luke:  So, Leia, I'd like you to turn over to me a mass murderer and a super weapon for him to fly around in.  Even though he left me completely incapacitated last time we fought, I feel I can keep a handle on him.  And anyway if you can't trust the one remaining jedi Master who fell to the Dark Side around a year ago, who can you trust?<br />Leia:  Doh!  Good point.  Sure.<br />skip forward to the Maw battle:<br />Wedge:  Everyone evacuate.<br />Luke:  Come on, Kyp.  Kyp?  Kyp, yoohoo, where are you?  Wedge, hold up.  I lost Kyp.<br />Wedge:  You lost a killer of billions.  (Luke nods)  And there is a super weapon right outside.  (Luke nods)  And you are the new hope for the galaxy.  (Luke nods)<br />Wedge feels a sudden depression come over him. Wedge pulls his blaster and blows his own brains out.<br />Sorry about that.  I wasn't all that impressed but it was entertaining enough to make me pick up Anderson's next book, Darksabre.  Love that spelling.	2000-09-26

Corran Horn, Tal'Dira, and  Iniryi Forge have quite a bit of stuff here.  Forge's one chapter seems to  give more dialogue than Stackpole ever gave her after WEdge's Gamble.   <br />(Man, this keyboard is messed up.  Any mistakes are probably because of  the keyboard.  Keys are sticking all over the place.)<br />2.  The humor is  still great.  Wedge' mutiny and his revenge on Jansen are terrific.   Elassar Targon seems to fit in well withthe Wraiths, except for Runt of  course.<br />3.  Awww, Wedge is back with Iella, I guess.  Sort of.  She's  mentioned in one scene.  Anyway, they are back together.  <br />4.  Han Solo  is dead on with character.  Great job, Allston.  <br />5.  Great Drama marks  this book.  The scene where Face accidently makes a revalation over an open  comm channel is great.  Wraiths in the oven, also good.  Wedge and Baron  Fel played out great too.<br />6.  Deaths.  Allston has backed the body count  down a notch or two but the deaths of characters are appreciated.  Two  relatively minor characters are dispatched in various battles but the way  one of them dies is particularly chilling.<br />7.  About time we had assasins  in the SW universe.  The attacks on the political and military officials  were very nicely done.  <br />8.  Opening.  Allston has the best opening  paragraphs of any SW EU author IMHO.  He started off Iron Fist with a bang  and he matches it here.  Twelve minutes to live.  Wow!!<br />One minor  quibble:<br />It got a little old having Solo jump in and pound at Zsinj and  then having him jump out and Solo slumps his shoulders in despair.   Redundancy and predictability are the name of the game in these slugging  mathces.<br />Gotta go.  I'd stay longer but someone just came in to tell me  that the Rancors are stealing my top hats.  I've got to put a stop to that.   See ya.	2000-09-12

I was somewhat dubious about the whole thing since I didn't want  anyone to ruin Solo's past.<br />The Jenos Idanian and F8-GN i let pass,  although Idanian was pretty tricky and I didn't notice the inside joke  right away.<br />Explains why Han is distrustful of religion and doesn't haul  slaves.  I really think that Bria should have just stayed here and not  shown up in the other books.<br />I will comment on the fight between Han and  Garris Shrike.  This has got to be on of the most graphic violent  encounters in the Star Wars universe.  (Excepting Dark Tide I and II.)  I  thought it played off pretty well.  Also, Hal Horn is mentioned.  Corran  would have been about ten when this happened. Just thought I'd mention it.	2000-08-08

Kid D'X'oln, Dravis, Roa,  Mako, Durga, Jabba, Chewbacca's worst nightmare, Ana Blue, Zeen, Baron Fel,  a certan Skywalker, Vuffi Ra, and more.<br />This book wins because of two  things:  Lando and Boba Fett.  I think Crispin got the best look into the  helmet of Fett of anyone, with the possible exception of Moran.  Crispin  ties her story in with Smith's twisted and hilarious Lando trilogy.  (by  twisted I mean plotwise.)<br />AS for the final battle, WOWOWOWWOWOWOWOWOW!!!!   Stunning.  I loved it.  All the cameos and such meet in a great battle  that is extremely well written.  <br />Lest I forget, I loved the Imperials  and their planning and sneaking around.  Also, I've always kind of wondered  why Han apparently never had any friends at the Imperial Academy.  Finally,  we see one.  Very nice book.  The best of the trilogy.  I loved the  &quot;bring the Hutts to their . . . &quot; line.  I just wish she hadn't  repeated it.  It was only funny once.	2000-08-08

It was.  I snickered and grinned a few times to a chapter.  Venting the spleen, the spoof of Skywalker's lightsaber trick from ROTJ, Face's brilliant ideas all  stand out now as well as the bar tending droid.  <br />But humor was not all  this book had to offer.  The dogfights were well done.  I liked the way  Allston improved on Stackpole by switching viewpoints several times in the  same chapter.    The groud sequences were well done, in suspense.  The  overloading holoprojector, improv and rebel slang on Imperial channels were  all standout.<br />Allston somehow makes us know and care about all the  characters unlike Stackpole.  We know every character and his or her or  it's motivation and inner thoughts.  In this Al;lston has troubled himself  to not have expendables.  The death scenes are well done and Wedge's letter  is the part of this book that has stayed with me the longest.  Allston, a  worthy author.  He has joined an elite rank in my mind.  He ranks with  Stackpole and Zahn as the only truly great Star Wars authors out there.	2000-07-31

Stackpole came on like gangbusters with his first three, the best of which was the third followed by the second.  All new characters free the author  to do daring things but. . . <br />Every important character who died in this  series was resurrected.  Good character, that is.  Andoorni Hui and Peshk  Vri'syk are exceptions but then we never knew them to begin with.  Same for  Shiel.<br />Lujayne dies and we get her sister.  Jace dies and in the worst  travesty of the whole series shows up in the last book for one chapter.   Corran dies, no wait.  Mirax dies, no wait.  Gavin dies, no wait.<br />The  best sequences in the whole series are the deaths of Loor and Derricote.   at least they stay dead.

Rogue Squadron is the worst of the series but only because it is the first  book.  Characters must be introduced and we have to get to know them.   Wedge Antilles has always been one of my favorites.  This book let me get  to know him better and introduced to others who are know on my top ten  list:  Tycho, Gavin, Corran and my personal favorite from this book, Bror  Jace.  The people are so real and the comradeship is amazing.  Stackpole is  the best.	2000-07-12

While many other books managed to be about as good, none were better.  Characters drive this book not battles.  <br />Sequences that really shine are WEdge's trip where he  is almost forced into a fight.  (More ethical behavior dead ahead.)   Gavin's encounter with the Bothan.  The search for Bacta.  The entire trial  sequence, which shed light on Wedge and Tycho as fast friends. In a day  where two men who show affection are called gays, it is nice to know that  some authors can still write about simple friendships.  Corran's escape  sequence and the deaths of two main characters are outstanding.<br />Stackpole  holds himself back in the action department this time out which causes more  tension to build until it lets go with a bang.  <br />Stackpole still hasn't  topped this one.

More is done with Gavin in this book which is nice.  <br />Not many space  battles.  Most of the fighting takes place on the ground.  This makes for a  nice change of pace from the first book.  The plot to free the criminals  from Kessel sounded rather forced but then I guess it was intended that  way.  WEdge didn't like it either.  Iella is introduced.  I somehow knew  whenI first read this book that she and Wedge were made for  eachother.<br />The ending is a shock and leads into the third book.  So until  Wedge breaks down and does something unethical,make mine Stackpole.	2000-07-12

On  rereading it a couple of years later I still greatly enjoyed it.  I was  pleased to hear that Kathy Tyers will be writing a hardcover for the NJO.   I hope she reaches this level again.  <br />I personally enjoyed the political  moving and backstabbing.  I liked the slow easy peaceful pace that Tyers  took for most of the first half.  AFter the first battle,I mean.  <br />I  never got into Dev like I think we were supposed to.  He came off as  pathetic simpleminded and all that.<br />Leia's vision is stunning as is the  moments when Luke touches the enteched presences in battle.  Wedge didn't  have much to do, but oh well, the novel didn't suffer from his nonpresence.   <br />Everyone is dead on character and the romance was pretty funny at  times.  Luke is pretty much the main character but I liked the prison break  with Solo.<br />All in all Tyers knew what she was doing.  About the time I  got bored with negotiations she kicked it into high gear:  poisened Luke,  threw Leia in prison, transported Luke to the ship and all.<br />She displayed  a flawless sense of timing that serves this book well.  While I am no a big  prose fan, her writing was well done and flowed.  I await Balance Point ( I  think that is the name) with baited breath.	2000-07-12

It can be divided into three parts, Prologue, Jedi Training, and Investigation.  I will review these seperately.<br />First, Prologue.  Positives:  Wedge Antilles.  In Rogue Squadron Corran and Wedge  were enemies from word one:  Wedge determined to change Corran, Corran  determined to stay the same.  Wedge won and Corran is a better man for it.   Stackpole shows how the relationship has grown.<br />Two:  Han Solo.  Since  Corran expressed distaste for Solo, I've been waiting for a face to face  meeting.  Stackpole delivers with a bang.  Stackpole, in just two scenes,  displays a mastery of Solo's character that many authors can't get in a  whole book or whole series.  (Hambly and McIntire spring to  mind.)<br />Prologue:  five stars.  Great start.<br />Jedi training sequence.   Negatives:  It gos on a little long considering we know what is going to  happen.  could have been trimmed. <br />Positives:  Wedge Antilles.  Kev  Anderson deserves a round of applause for trying to give Wedge a meaningful  relationship but Qwi never really worked.  It is so cool to read Corran  outlining the reasons I always knew Qwi was wrong.<br />&quot;Jedi  Racer.&quot;  I laughed and laughed when I read the scene where Luke and  Corran whip on each oither.  I loved the majestic lightsaber duel turns  into a slapstick back alley brawl with two of the three stooges.<br />Jedi  training:  three stars.  Okay.<br />Investigation:   Negatives:  The stance of  the Anzat's student.  Every time I tried to duplicate the fighting style  with the lightsaber pommel near my chin I either cut my legs off or clopped  myself in the head.   The growing lightsaber.  Gantoris and now Corran.   Jedi fads.  I can see all the male Jedi strutting around boasting about who  has the longest and biggest. . . lightsaber.  Sheesh.<br />Positives:   Corran's beating of the jerk while he is undercover.  Nuff said.<br />Corran's  fight in the alley with, six or so Jedi.  Nuff said.<br />The flashback to the  Jedi battle during the clone wars.  Was that Obi wan there to the side?   Mmmmmaybe.<br />The best scene in the whole book:  Corran's battle with Rogue  Sqaudron.  WOW!   Nuff said.<br />Investigation:  four stars.  Very  good<br />5+3+4=12.  12/3=4.<br />I Jedi:  four stars. Goodbye.	2000-05-17
US	50498021	RAAEKC8V7USW2	0312205511	724985102	Ice Station	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Turn it off!	This book had few flaws that I will now address.  Number one:  little research.  The SAS are the world's best fighting and killing force, hands down, no question.  No way could the SAS get mopped all over the floor like  they did.  And killer whales usually do not, despite their name, kill  people.  Sorry Matthew, I guess someone neglected to tell you that the  movie Orca is not based on a true story.<br />Two:  unbelievable.  When one  man can defeat a submarine singlehandly, kill a man in hand to hand combat  with his hands cuffed, and wreck a hovercraft by throwing his helmet at it,  well.  <br />Besides these flaws I still give this book four stars.  Why?   Becuase it is so much fun.  The aerial combat, the aformentioned submarine  combat, the hovercraft chase, the battle in the dicing bell, the sequence  in the ice cavern, the passages dealing with Pete Cameron and his wife  whose name I have forgotten, and the sequence with Book and the detatchable  hood really shine.<br />Suspend your disbelief long enough to read it.  I know  you'll like it.	2000-05-11

I enjoyed it while I was reading it.  All I ask for from a Star Wars book.<br />Good things:  Kuat's character was so fleshed out.  Fenald was neat too.  I liked the family meeting and the  treachery and the vibroblades popping out.  Kudar Mu'bat, while having a  really stupid name, was a little expanded on in this book as well.   Balancesheet shows promise.<br />Bad things:  Thrihnn Voss'on't, while having  a really stupid name, was kind of neat but I have to wonder about Xizor's  big plan.  Can't you hear it now.<br />Emporer:  What is your brilliant  plan?<br />Xizor:  We'll place a bounty on someone and let everyone fight over  him.  Ha Ha Ha!  I am just too good.<br />Emporer:  That is the stupidest plan  I have ever heard.<br />Xizor:  I wasn't finished.  The bounty on this guy  will be really big.<br />At this point Darth Vader begins to choke  Xizor.<br />One last thing, what is the sentient weapon that feeds on human  spirits mentioned on the back.  It got my curiosity up and then I finfished  the book and realized I still knew nothing.	2000-04-13

I have another review down there somewhere.  I recently reread this book and realized that there were some mistakes in my review.  <br />first the characters:  Bossk-dead on target.  He did not die in Prize  Pelt.  He dug out I think.<br />Dengar-too wimpy.  His character was okay but  he wasn't the physical speciman we know from Payback.<br />4-LOM-his  appearance in Hard Merchandise makes him out to be just a little flat.  He  seems to simply tolerate Zuckess rather than be friends with him.  At least  Jeter tells us why.  (The events of Sahdows of the Empire.)<br />Zuckess-too  stupid, whiny and not intuitive enough.  Nothing els to be said.<br />Boba  Fett-close to the target but Crispen, Moran and Montogomery did a better  job.<br />IG-88-Yes he did exist and the character was dead on too.  IG-88 was  created around I think a year and a half to two years after ANH.  The THEN  part of this book takes place around two and a half years after ANH.  Check  Ted Edwards Timeline in the excellent Unarthorized Star Wars Compendium.	2000-04-12
US	50498021	R30213N3BXYZ86	0345428544	573865480	Dark Tide I: Onslaught (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 2)	Books	4	1	5	N	N	A couple of questions and requests	I have a few questions about the New Jedi Order.  First, dealing with Leia's talking about trying to get Wedge, Hobbie or Jansen in contact with Han:  is this going to happen?  I haven't actually read the whole book yet  so if I act dumb on some parts I am.  I heard Jim Lucemo or someone like  that was going to write a couple  of books about Han.  I am hoping that  Wedge, Tycho, Hobbie and/or Jansen will be involved with this  book.<br />Second question:  Now that the NJO is started, is it strictly taboo  to write books taking place within the original time line.  I was thinking  about Stackpole's Isard's Revenge.  I really liked how creative it was to  tell a sort of behind the scenes story to the Thrawn trilogy.  I was hoping  maybe there could be more stories like this.  Tell us where Rogue and  Wraith Squadrons are during the Black Fleet trilogy, Children of the Jedi,  Crystal Star, the entire Young Jedi Knight series.  Think of how many great  stories could be written.  I hope this is still possible.<br />Three:  Could  Aaron Allston or Stackpole as a second choice write some NJO stories  dealing with Wraith Squadron and Wedge, Tycho, Hobbie and Jansen?  This  would be great too.  I don't believe they could stay retired with the  whatever those aliens are called on the rampage.  <br />As you've guessed I am  a big fan of Wedge, Tycho, Hobbie and Jansen.  All my requests boil down to  this.  Give me more of them.  Wrapped into other books, starring in their  own books, in the old timeline and the NJO I want more of them.   Quickly,  why do we refer to Jansen by his last name?  We have Wedge, Tycho, Corran,  Gavin, Luke, Han, Leia and Jansen.  Why not Wes?  Just curious.	2000-03-21
US	50498021	R5DM6A1A61UJF	0425152235	718230201	Angel of Death	Books	4	1	2	N	N	I liked it	I happened to think this was a passable novel.  Jack has always been better with historical fiction.  Maybe I'm just biased, seeing as how I love the period of WWI and WWII.  Read Night of the Fox and others to get  the best from this author.<br />Dillon has never been my favorite character.   The story picked up a bit toward the end.  The KGB agent didn't have much  to do.  Rupert Lang was pretty neat.  I like3d the way his plot wrapped up.   I think Jack should have written more of a chase scene or something when  Ferguson confronted Lang about the gun.  The guy just ran away.  Blast!    Well, better call Dillon.  <br />Tom Curry was taken out too quick.  The  attempted killing of Keogh was okay.  The scenes with Dillon down in the  pit were tiresome.	2000-03-15
US	50498021	R3GNVNTPUSDJ7J	0451198719	493840198	The Monster of St. Marylebone	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Disclaimer Please	This book should have a disclaimer on it.  It is nothing like the usual Sherlock Holmes story by Conan Doyle.  While it was a very good and exciting read, it was quite a departure.<br />Homosexuals, intimated  pedophiles, graphic beheadings, street brawls, fistfights, impaling, and  Mycroft Holmes in  a very strange light all combine to make this extremely  different than what you might expect.  The IRB figured prominately in the  story and made it very interesting.  I happen to like period pieces where  you can tell what period you are in.<br />Very good but not for the faint of  heart.  <br />P.S.  Holmes in coma for the first, what, third? of the book.   Strange.	2000-03-01
US	50498021	RYDZLS88CPF44	0061057363	328368251	Ruins (The X-Files)	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Read Ground Zero  (at least the last few chapters)	This book was nowhere near as good as everybody seems to think.  Three things destroyed this book.<br />First:  Scully.  She was just kinda there.  Nothing like the show.<br />Second:  Rubicon.  The guy talked way too much.   &quot;My daughter is missing.  Let me tell you something about the Mayan  culture.  There was a very interesting archealogist once. . . .&quot;  Come  on.  (I made that quote up.  That was the way he talked though.)<br />Third:   plot.  Jakes and his commando team put some much needed action into this  story.  He didn't appear until very late in the book.  The chopped off  finger.  What exactly did this have to do with anything.  The villians were  cardboard cutouts.  Why all the buildup to a dissappointing ending?<br />The  X-files succeeds as a television show because they are forced to expidite  matters because of the hour long format.  The plot itself can be only  around 45 minutes long.  The movie and the books all fall apart bacause of  the length afforded.  <br />Granted Ruins and Ground Zero are the only two  I've read.  Ground Zero, while the premise seems boring, really takes off  in the last few chapters during the countdown to the test.  Read the first  line again.	2000-03-01
US	50498021	R97EE1PTCKY30	0553572733	474750115	Before the Storm (Star Wars: The Black Fleet Crisis)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	It's me again	I have already reviewed this book but I have to speak up again.  This book is great.  Mostly.  The plots start off with a bang in this book.  <br />The second book of this series is where the failing is.  It slows to such a  snail's pace you are ready for everyone to just die.  Also, if the author  hadn't split all three plots into seperate sections then the Lando story  would have been better, Luke's story would maby have been a tiny bit  interesting and Leia's story would have been excellent.<br />In the third book  the author tries to speed up but just falls flat on his face.  The Lando  plot created a lot of mystery in the first two books but the solution just  kind of makes you say, &quot;WHAT IN THE WORLD?&quot;  Luke's story, such  as it was, actually finally ties in with Leia's story.  A pity that the  stories couldn't have a better ending.<br />ALl in all, the series did not  live up to the first book.	2000-02-23

Next step, get over it.<br />4-LOM wasn't in the book.  Maybe that is why Bossk and Zuckuss were working  together.  <br />Granted Dengar didn't act like the superman we thought we  knew, but oh well, he is in love (regardless of what we think about this,  it did happen.  Like he says in Tales of the Bounty Hunters now he has  something to lose.)<br />Barve was a little over used.  Maybe a lot.  Okay,  I'll be happy if I never hear the word again.  Now I'm going to get over  it.<br />I agree that Xixor should not have appeared in this book.  He is  perhaps the only villian that I really hated.  I was so stinking when that  barve was blown to atoms at the end of Shadows of the Emprire by Steve  Perry, nicknamed the b-word.<br />(Barve)	1999-12-14
