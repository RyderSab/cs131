Without a doubt one of the most intriguing space operas I have read in a long time. Written in &quot;command journals&quot; and the like, Colonel Marc Hendrix heads up a stellarship, the E.S.S. CLARKE, with a wide mix of humans and one alien, a Vulradian named H'Thof who is the executive officer, on board.<br />The time is the 28th Century and humanity had barely survived a fifth and final war that devastated Old Earth which caused the space-faring (via dark-matter engines) Vulradians to take the surviving humans and transplant them onto a lush world, which would become known as New Earth, in the Cygnus star system. It would be here that the humans and Vulradians would lay the ground work for both the Stellar Corps as well as the Confederation of Sentient Worlds that, over the years, would swell to hundreds of member-races and planets, not to mention the many dozens of colony worlds set up by humans.<br />This book has so much to keep you interested, not the least of which is the very realistic manner in which the main characters are treated: There is, of course, the dark-matter engines which gives stellarships &quot;hyper-dimension speeds&quot; as well as maser pistols that use accelerated meson radiation to either explode or disintegrate their targets (and maser cannons on the CLARKE as well). And the jump chambers which create &quot;artificial wormholes&quot; through which ground teams can walk to instantaneously be teleported to the surface of a planet about which the CLARKE was orbiting. And so on.<br />The first assignment of this stellarship and crew is one that not only brings out the brutality of humanoids on another world, but brings a mystery to light that, once the ground team headed up by Colonel Hendrix and Lieutenant-Colonel H'Thof escapes capture and torture, takes on a very unexpected twist that is very believable.
