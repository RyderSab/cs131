Written as a so called Christian Sci-fi novel, this story has nothing to do with the Lord Jesus Christ. In fact the only thing resembling Christianity in this book is the names of their space ships, 'Rising Savior', New Hope', and a few Bible verses heading up a few chapters.     It seems the author confused Christianity with L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, or that he at least combined the two religions into one, for convenience sake.     The Christians in this novel are portrayed by a flying saucer cult, sending space ships into orbit around the Earth. The cult, led by two men who have lost family members, and their faith in God to catastrophies, meander around with their new techno toys, till they find that they can make A LOT OF $$$$$ from their new antigravity technology. Their quest soon spires into the pursuit for profits, and their methods for protecting themselves becomes a case of the lesser of two evils.     Opposing them is Manuel Crowe, representing the Devil, and using all his wicked schemes to destroy the cult's quest for space exploration, and their very existence.     The good guys are not so good, or altruistic, and the bad guy, a lot better fleshed out, is all bad, in this very forgetable sci-fi novel, with the air of a screenplay for a VERY LOW BUDGET sci-fi flick.     At three hundred pages, this story might have held my attention long enough to finish it, but is soon becomes dull, tedious, and predictable, a quarter of the way through.    Don't waste your time, or money on this monolithe of a book. If you want a truly great end times novel, pick up instead;    Joel C. Rosenberg's 'The Ezekiel Option', a far better researched, and exciting novel.	2005-08-08

Written as the 3rd book in the series, The Ezekiel Option covers end times events, and tells how Russial works in to ancient Biblical Prophecies, mentioned of course in the Book of Ezekiel. <br /> A coup occurs in Russia, and a new evil dictactor bent on the destruction of Isreal takes his seat as the new Tzar. <br />  Most of the action and suspense occur in the last 100 or so pages of this book, as Jon Bennet sneaks into Russia, to try to to rescue his love, Erin, while Isreal is faced with certain doom, from Russia, and Islamic, and European countries allied to destroy her. Isreal's only defense; The Sampson Option-a nuclear storm to destroy her invaders. <br />  This book has more of an evangelical outreach than it's two predessors, but I'm sure fans of Mr. Rosenberg will NOT be disappointed with the way things turn out!	2005-08-05

The author(again not Cussler) clues you in on what's going to happen next, in just about every paragraph. This is not only unnecessary, it cuts down on the suspense for the readers. This is the trait of an amatuer author, and not one who has written some of the best adventure novels for the past thirty plus years.  <br />  It is obvious from reading this book that Craig Dirgo did most of the writing, and Cussler only put his name on the book, to get it past the editor's desk, and onto bookstore shelves. Clive Cussler should be more careful about the books he puts his name on, or he will start losing readers, myself being one of them! <br />  Though somewhat better than the first story in the series 'Golden Buddha' (which I tore up, and threw away!) this is nowhere near the quality of story writing he puts into his Dirk Pitt, and Kurt Austin novels. My advice; Stick with early Dirk Pitt novels, anything up to, and including 'Floodtide'.	2005-05-23

Though the plot seemed plausible, I couldn't get beyond how terribly it was written. I'm amazed that trash like this even gets published, the pros, and descriptions of action scenes were horendous, and the characterizations were cartoonlike.  <br />  The author, as well as main character have a 'Center of the universe' ego, but what bothered me most was that the author made it a point to use the Lord's name in vain, as often as possible, something few authors do, because it is unnecessary, and uncalled for.  <br />  Read instead, anything written by Clive Cussler, a much better, and more reverent author. Cussler, leader of National Underwater Marine Agency(NUMA), lives his adventures, and embellishes on them to make them more exciting for the reader.   Cussler also takes care to not insult his readers beliefs, or sensitivities, something Bell considers immaterial when writing his trashcan fillers.	2004-12-09

Dirk Sr. makes only a cameo appearance in this novel, early on, and in the rescue of his two children, Dirk Jr. and his lovely daughter, Summer. It is rather obvious that Dirk Cussler is doing much, if not most of the writing of this book, under the supervision of his father, Clive. Dirk writing on Dirk? The only disadvantage of that is that the reader might get the feeling that the younger Cussler is writing a fictionalized autobiography. Oh, well.  <br />  As to the storyline...WW2 Japanes Subs carrying bioweapons of mass destruction, and North Korean agents that want to use these weapons against the U.S., leaving the Japs to take the blame, while they conveniently kick American troops out of S. Korea, and re-unite under one flag. Let me just say that it is the best Dirk Pitt novel written since Floodtide, with more than enough action, daring do, and a bit more international intrigue,  conspiracy, and bio-terror than are common in most of his books.  <br />  Overall, A lot of fun to read. A great Christmas gift for readers, young, and old, alike.	2004-11-27

The only problem; a young ambitious lawyer hired to discover the intended Tsar's claim to the throne finds evidence that two of the Romanov children actually survived the attempted assassination on them, and their entire family, Tsar Nicholas 2, and Tsarina Alexandra. This leads the young Attorney on a wild goose chase to find the heirs of the dinesty, while on the run from those who hired him to find the link, in the first place. Please, give me a break! Why hire someone to investigate the existence of someone you don't believe to exist to begin with? And then try to knock him off when he finds a mere hint that a closer heir to the throne than the person you are backing?  <br /> The plot, as well as the characters are stereotypical, and weak in this convoluted, contrived story.  <br />  There is absolutely no proof that any of the Romanovs survived that fateful night in July of 1918, that brought on the Russian Revolution, and ushered in 72 years of Communism in Russia.  <br /> Anyone comming forward claiming to be an heir to the Tsar, and therefore the throne, would have been killed by the government, or locked up in Siberia where they'd never be heard from again.	2004-10-17

Too bad, because he used to be one of the best action thriller writers in the business. <br /> His formula writing uses very little imagination, and after a reading just a few pages, you get the feeling that you've read the story before, with very few differences in action scenes, and story line. The only thing he changes is the names of the villains, and title, from book to book. <br />  I guess he just got tired of using his God given imagination, like so many great authors before him, who rewrite the same story, over, and over again, expecting the readers to buy his books.  <br /> Though Cussler has become formulaic, at least he varies the plot line, and action scenes enough to make the story interesting for the reader. And at 77, at least he has an excuse for formula writing, where Jon Land is no more than his late 40s. <br /> Maybe he's not too old to redeem himself, if he gets away from writing serials, and gets back to the way he used to write when he was a young aspiring author, and wanted to thrill his reading audience with new, and interesting stories with each book.  <br /> At least let's hope so!	2004-08-04

At fifty some odd years of age, Jason Bourne is just getting a bit old to be chasing around the world, looking to terrorists on the loose.

The ensuing power struggle, and civil war for leadership of the terrorist organization, not unlike a Mafia power struggle, leaves you stunned, and gasping for breath.( In my opinion, I would have let them kill each other off, then we be done with them, once and for all!)<BR> A Peace Plan between Isreal, and Palastine to drill for oil, making citizens of both parties wealthy? Sorry, it wouldn't happen. Terrorist are too hate driven to allow any peace plan to work. Arafat has been offered land more than once, and he refused it, because his, and most of militant Islam's whole purpose isn't to get their own land, but the deaths, and destruction of Isrealis, Christians, and everyone else they consider &quot;Infidels&quot;.<BR>  The book gives you insight into the Isreali Palastinian(Philistine) problems, and is a lot of fun to read! Better in many ways than the first book &quot;The Last Jihad&quot;.	2004-05-01

I found howeverm the action sequences a bit repetitive. An Internationally sanctioned hit squad that is transported to terrorist situations where hostages lives are in the balance. This International S.W.A.T. Team, made up of the best of U.S., U.K. German, and a few other countries, goes in, and kills the perpetrators of these crimes. Not a bad idea, so far as I'm concerned. <BR> Only two things making this international hit squad a total fantasy; with the &quot;Liberal&quot; politicians feeling sorry for the criminals these days, it would take days, if not weeks for them to agree to kill off their criminally bent friends, unless, of course, one of their own family members was being held hostage. <BR> The second is; most major cities around the world already have militarily trained Swat teams to deal with this sort of problem. <BR> Still, all in all, I'd have to say one of his more interesting, and exciting books to read. <BR> My favorite Clancy Novel to this day, is still &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; which he wrote with Larry Bond, whom I consider a far better writer of war, and anti-terrorist novels than Clancy is.	2003-11-28

More like copper penny	A long time fan of Cussler's, I waited for this book to come out for three months, and when I started reading it, it seemed pretty good-a heroic rescue from a Cuban prison...then the book simply died. <BR> The long list of characters was hard to keep up with, even with a list of characters in the front of the book.<BR> The story took too long to get going, to the point of sheer boredom. Though he broke from his norma formula for this one, I'm sorry to say it was rather disappointing, though I wasn't too thrilled with his second series, the Numa files when it was first introduced in &quot;Serpent&quot; either. Hopefully his next Oragon Files story will contain the fast paced action we have come to expect of Cussler. Not his best book, but hey, they can't all be A+s can they? I am still looking forward to his next Dirk Pitt novel due out in December-&quot;Trojan Odyssey&quot;, and I found &quot;White Death&quot;, and &quot;Fire Ice&quot;, to be quite enjoyable-his best 2 in the Kurt Austin series. <BR> Chin up, Clive, we still have faith in you!	2003-10-16

Males were referred to as she, and females, as he, in several spots throughout the book, to the point where it got confusing as to who the author was refering to. The publisher should have picked these mistakes up, and NOT published the uncorrected proof, to save time, and money. <BR> Overall, though, it was an enjoyable book to read, by a talented author.<BR>Read also; &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, and &quot;Retribution&quot;, two very good books, also by Pineiro.	2003-09-24

Far better than Tom Clancy, if you want a book that moves along, he takes the appropriate amount of pages to tell a story, unlike Clancy who takes a thousand pages, to write a three hundred page story. <BR>  Unfortunately he no longer writes under this name, but now writes strictly under the name of David Hagberg, rehashing the same 'Formulaic' story over, and over again, with his semi-retired spy/assassin Kirk McGarvey as his main protagonist.	2003-02-23

Clive Cussler should have saved his rave review for another book. Totally uninteresting story of an ex-spy/assasin-Briggs Tanner, who witnesses the execution of a man he barely knows, and decides he must get involved in finding out who killed the poor man. Very few action sequences, and those there were, barely made it worth drudging through to the end.  <BR>  Come on, isn't that what the police are for? <BR>Suggestion...skip it, and read something else, anything else!	2002-07-31

The book was slow, and plodding, and I had to struggle to get through it. Thank God, it wasn't bogged down with detail and was relatively easy to get through. He used other author's names, such as Clancy, as characters in his book, hopefully to strike the readers' interest. It didn't work, at least, not on this reader. The story was about the old hardliners in Russia, trying to take back their country from the weak, liberals that sold it down the drain. The arch villain was a supposed descendant of Tzar Nicholas, who attempted to take back what he thought was his rightful place as the new Tzar of Russia, and unite all the former replubics behind him. As I said earlier; Good plot, could have been better done.	2002-07-31

Black Wolf tells about a rogue fringe of North American Indians  starting a terrorist campain against the present government, ripping their ancestors off, 140 years ago, and stealing their land, and heritage. <BR>The hero, Link Anderson gets messages in his dreams from his long dead ancestor, about someone plotting destruction against his counntry? Come on, now...the character didn't buy it, and neither will you. First he gets the messages, then when he starts to lose them, he undergoes an old Indian torture ritual to get back something he didn't want to begin with? Only to find out that the culprits were long lost brothers, descended from that same shaman? Oh, the author tries to save the book, and show us he's not anti-native American, by having some of the Indians help him find the culprits, and he falls in love with one in the end, finally accepting his native American heritage. If there ever was a book that was \\"POLITICALLY INCORRECT\\" it was sure this one. Enough Anti-Native American sentiment.<BR> My advice...skip this one, if you value your time, and read  anything else, instead!	2002-07-31

First of all, I couldn't tell you how it ended, cause I never got that far. Except for the execution in the beginning of the book, and the ensuing chase, this book had litterally nothing to keep the reader interested enough to bother with finishing the story. <BR> The author spent way to much time dealing with the main, and secondary character's background lives to the point where it become down right boring! <BR> I read it to the halfway point, where I could no longer stand it, tore it up, and threw it in the trash can, like I do with all the books that thoroughly disgust, or bore me! <BR> Note: there was a movie based on this book, with Christopher Lambert playing the lead role. Suggestion: see the movie, like Bond, it was far better than the book.	2002-07-16

Classic Cussler, with plenty of Swashbuckling adventure, rescuing damsels in distress, and all, but what can I say? I'm a Dirk Pitt fan. In Dirk Pitt, Cussler created a character us older readers could identify with; suave, debonaire, lady's man we wish we all were. Unfortunately Kurt Austin, Cussler's new main character lacks two of the traits that made Pitt so enjoyable to read about-his sense of humor, and pazazz. I'm not asking Cussler to create a clone of his Dirk Pitt character, but I wish he'd put a little more time into creating a likable personality for his new hero. Still, all in all, Cussler being my favorite author on the market-(he lives the adventures he writes about, minus the James Bond exploits, of course!) I will definitely read future Cussler novels.	2002-07-07

PLAIN, AND SIMPLE	I got only part of the way through this book, and had to put it down...it was so boring! He develops his main character, and his plot, with a bit too much scientific interest, to the point where the story goes nowhere. You get the feeling he only wrote this book to fulfill a contract, or to show off is geological knowledge, and to keep himself busy, that he only threw in the characters, and the story to show off his smarts...not to write an exciting story for the reader's. He obviously tries to copy Cussler's writing style, and story telling abilities, but falls far shy of the mark, as Cussler runs Numa, and has experienced many diving adventures of his own, and writes Pitt, and Austin in as James Bondian clones of himself. <BR> DuBrull is a talented author, but doesn't show it in this book. Read instead his \\"Vulcan's Forge\\" and \\"Medusa Stone\\", which are much better books.	2002-06-21

Plenty of action, a little romance, and a lot of adventure! This one would have to rate along side Inca Gold, and Floodtide as my favorite Cussler novels. As per his successful formula, Dirk Pitt again gets himself into trouble by helping to save a damsel in distress, and he gets more than his money's worth, and so do we. I particularly enjoyed the aerial battle scene above New York City. He obviously wrote the novel pre-9/11. <BR> My only negative comment, is that you get the feeling he retired his major character(Dirk Pitt/Personna of Cussler himself) with this novel. Too bad, cause a lot of older guys, like myself really warmed up to Dirk, and Al, and loved reading of them getting themselves into, and out of perils. I look forward to reading his next novel Fire Ice, but will miss Dirk, and Al.	2002-05-25

Like his earlier Arc Light, the story was full of action, and suspense. One of, if not the best writer's of military action on the scene today. <BR> An anarchist rises to power in Russia, and wants to deflect international interest in himself, by spreading a campaign of terror in the U.S. and other countries. <BR> Action scene follows action scene, both military, and espionage, and you are left with the feeling you have read a really great thriller novel! Too bad he doesn't write anymore.	2002-05-25

The boy(Petey) does, and is kidnapped when riding away on his bike, only to show up many years later, to kill his older brother, and kidnap his family. <BR> Brad survives Peter's attempt on his life, but finds his family has been taken by his psychotic younger brother(or is he in fact his younger brother?). <BR> The whole story centers around the guilt ridden Brad searching for his family, by searching through Peter's past, to find out what had happened to him, to turn him into sick, demented person he turned out to be. <BR> Though only 310 pages, the story was way too long, and drawn out, without only three action scenes throughout the whole novel to keep your interest. <BR> This novel rates as one of the worst, by him, or anyone else I have read. The only reason I finished it, was because I liked Morrell's past novels, and expected it to get better at the end, which it did, but not by much. <BR> Read instead, his \\"Extreme Denial, \\"Covenant of the Flame\\", \\"Desperate Measures\\", \\"Fraternity of the Stone\\",\\"Brotherhood of the Rose\\", and \\"League of Night and Fog\\", and forget about this one.	2002-05-25

HIS INTEREST IN WRITING NOVELS IS ONLY A MEDIA TO PREACH HIS RELIGION OF EVOLUTION. (WHICH I DON'T ADHERE TO!) THIS BOOK HAS A BIT TOO MUCH ROMANCE INTEREST FOR MY TASTE, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ACTION SCENES THIS BOOK REALLY NEEDS TO BE TRULY INTERESTING(FOR MY TASTES.) OTHER READERS HAVE COMPARED HIS BOOKS TO AN INDIANA JONES MOVIE - NOT QUITE! TRY INSTEAD MATHEW REILY'S &quot;TEMPLE&quot; IF YOU REALLY WANT AN ARCHEOLOGICAL STORY THAT &quot;ROCKS&quot;.	2002-03-19

AN EXPEDITION OF SCIENTISTS, AND MILITARY PERSONEL IS SENT INTO THE AMAZON TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAN, AND THE GROUP HE DISAPPEARED WITH 4 YEARS AGO. THE EXPEDITION IS CONSTANTLY ASSAILED BY MAN EATING LOCUSTS? PIRHANA WITH LEGS? AND THOUSAND POUND JAGUARS? (SOUNDS LIKE JERASIC PARK IF YOU ASK ME!) THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE NOVEL IS BASED ON A TREE THAT CONTROLS EVOLUTION, AND HAS REMARKABLE HEALING POWERS WHEN NEAR IT, BUT CAUSES WIDESPREAD PLAGUE TO ANYONE TRYING TO ESCAPE THE POWER OF THE TREE, AND THOSE HE/SHE COMES IN CONTACT WITH? THE AUTHOR ALSO PREACHES ON THE LIE OF EVOLUTION THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. MY BEST ADVICE; READ MATHEW REILLY'S \\"ICE STATION\\", \\"TEMPLE\\", OR \\"AREA 7\\" INSTEAD. THOUGH THE BOOKS(INCLUDING THIS ONE) LACKS BELIEVABILITY, AT LEAST REILLY'S BOOKS HAVE ENOUGH ACTION TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED. HE DOESN'T PREACH ON EVOLUTION, EITHER!	2002-03-19

A LOT OF FUN TO READ, THOUGH, THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT FOUR STARS. THE PLOT CENTERS AROUND A GROUP OF ROGUE U.S. MILITARY MEN TRYING TO KILL U.S. PRESIDENT IN A SECRET MILITARY INSTALATION IN NEVADA. THE PRESIDENT HAS A MICROCHIP IN HIS HEART THAT WILL SET OFF ATOMIC BOMBS IN 14 U.S. AIRPORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY, IF HIS HEART STOPS. SCHOFIELD, ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF HIS TROOPS FROM HIS BOOK ICE STATION, TEAM UP WITH THE FEW REMAINING SECRET SERVICE AGENTS, TO KEEP THE PRESIDENT ALIVE. <BR>ACTION SCENE FOLLOWS ACTION SCENE IN THIS ROLLER COASTER RIDE OF A NOVEL. THOUSANDS OF BULLETS FLY, AND NO ONE GETS HIT? OH,WELL, IF YOU WANT BORING REALITY, READ A TOM CLANCY NOVEL, IF YOU WANT ACTION, READ THIS BOOK.

The story centers around the main character investigating the killing of his brother by a bear, in a small rural town. The author builds some tension, but after reading it for fifty some odd pages, and nothing else happens, you lose interest, fast. I just couldn't get into it, but will try his other books(This Present Darkness, and Piercing the Darkness) hopefully they are better. <BR>  Suggestion for Christians who like a book that moves; try Cain, by James Byron Huggins, same basic plot, but it moves a lot faster! Peretti should try reading this book to see how to write a Christian thriller. <BR>  Another Good Christian (End Times) thriller is Blood Moon by Hal Lindsay.	2002-01-08

The action comes at tremendous clips, and the story rarely slows down to a speed under that of the Concord. My one negative comment I have to give is that you have to take a vacation, not only from home, but from reality as well. Some of the scenes leave you saying to yourself...come on now, exciting, but rediculous. I enjoy an action thriller as well as any other reader, but I would like to not have to leave my brain on vacation while I'm reading the book. I gave the story four stars because of it's terrific pace. Rarely have I read a book that was actually so much fun. I just wish the author would stay a little more credible, so that the reader wouldn't have to suspend reality to enjoy the book.	2001-07-04
