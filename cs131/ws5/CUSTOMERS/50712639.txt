I was a hot, cute, young, single woman and attracted my share of men.  I am now happily married to a guy who chased me. Not one guy that *I* pursued ever worked out.  EVER. I was trained to go after things in work situations.  I could never figure it out.  I hate to accept the fact that men don't like to be called, asked out, etc.  But it just doesn't work.  If it works for you, then you have something I don't have! <br /> <br />Sadly enough even though I'm married I have had to apply this to several girlfriends.

Fairly decent for her, but sometimes there are situations in her books that are simply 50 years out of date. Example is the lady in a former book whose husband REFUSED to let her attend law school. Hello? 2004 calling? I remember a story about a character giving birth who was forced to give birth with her legs strapped down. This written in like 1985 and they stopped doing that in like 1965. Well, the throwback in this book is the two selfish girls who were &quot;cruel&quot; to the stepmother. Hello? 2004 calling? Like 60% of their contemporaries don't have mixed families? Like mom DIED two years ago? Like y'all are adults? The twist that irritates so much that it throws you out of the web of belief needed to enjoy a romance novel.	2004-08-01

It is not easy to adopt a child when you are a middle aged single parent--there are thousands of younger married couples competing with you.  It was wayyy too easy and fast.  Secondly, it didn't seem that Paris had a huge desire to be a mother again--it seemed more that she wanted companionship.  Thirdly, it may be old fashioned but I think kids need fathers.   The dating stuff was pretty funny and a welcome change from most of her books which deal only with perfect romances.   I would not be surprised to see Ms. Steel turn up totin' an infant after reading this book.	2003-06-15

However, this book is, well, I'd have to say the most important book that I've ever written.    I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize for stoopidness.  I fell in love with CPhobe #1 when I was 20.   The relationship started to go downhill at 7 months.  Looking for relief, I met CPhobe #2.  Man!  This one wrote me the most beautiful letters, etc.   I did not love #2, but he won me over and when #1 dumped me 2 months later (while sobbing, gack) I cast my lot with #2.  This relationship unraveled in 4 years.  That was 20 years ago. #1 is still single at 53 and #2 is 18 years into a marriage where he hasn't been faithful or particularly loving, but he's set.  So there you have it, the extreme and the non extreme phobe--both will drive you slap crazy.   Then I met #3 and moved to NYC from Alabama to be with him.  2 years--Bitter End.  Back to Alabama.  Met #4, 4 years--Bitter End.  At 32 I was bitter and cynical.  Read this book.  Slapped my head and said Eureka!  Met a nice guy, married him, all is wonderful 10 years later.  If I had read this book when I was 20 I would have had the life I deserved with a nice person...	2002-12-17

This book is invaluable, priceless advice for pretty, ambitious young women who would like to try to have both career and family.
