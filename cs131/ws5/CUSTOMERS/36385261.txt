The first novel was so unique, while this one was terribly boring. The entire book centered around the battle of environmentalists. If those type of causes are dear to your heart you might enjoy this book, personally I'd spend my money on his first book instead.	2005-09-23

I really felt the character's happiness and heartaches. He has a style of writing that is poetic, yet crystal clear. If you order this book- and you should, you will also want to order \\"Clay's Quilt\\", as this is sort of a prequel to that.	2005-08-26

It took me a few chapters to get used to Pousson's style of writing, but then I was hooked. Very sad, very real. If you are looking for a happy, uplifting story to get away from reality, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a moving drama that will inspire emotions in you, including anger and sadness, this is an excellent book. Can't wait to read more from this author!	2005-01-11

There was something very powerful about this novel that I can't quite put my finger on. It brings a longing for simple pleasures and the closeness of family. Fans of Fannie Flagg should enjoy this novel.	2004-12-30

It semed to be building up to an interesting tale, but then it just ended. The characters were quite interesting, but the story fell flat. Apparently I was one of the few who didn't like it though, so if you enjoy southern, gentle fiction you may want to check it out from the library.	2004-12-22

I read it because of the good rating it has, but I can't figure out how all these people enjoyed it.

It is like nothing I've ever read before, he weaves a great story. I love how the story is half narrated by a character &quot;outside&quot; the main plot. This second perspective makes it like two stories in one. The only complaint I have is that I had hoped the ending would be a little stronger, but I can't complain that much because it is written realistically. This author has tremendous talent!	2004-03-22

The story is so confusing it literally gave me a headache, the characters are really strange, and the constant swearing is irritating. I read a couple books a week, and this is the first book I have ever disliked so much. I wish I could think of atleast one nice thing to say about it... it's original, I'll give it that.	2003-12-04

Sparks did a great job with the characters- they are easy to relate to and fun to become friends with. He wrapped it all up nice in the end, but I wasn't left feeling &quot;wowed&quot;. It was easy to guess what was going to happen next. A good story overall however.	2003-12-04

You will come away a better person. The part that really got me was when Morrie said how too many people today walk around in a daze- so busy worrying about the past and the future, they don't live in the moment. This book changed my life as much as any self-help book ever has. It only takes a couple hours to read, and it's a couple hours I will never regret or forget.	2003-11-21

Macomber does a wonderful job of defining her characters and really brining their personalities to life. Debbie Macomber is quickly climbing to the ranks of Danielle Steel and Nora Roberts.	2003-11-06
