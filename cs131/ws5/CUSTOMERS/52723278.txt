I grew quite fond of Varrus in the Skystone. Varrus'journal picks up where we left off in the first book.<br /> Rome is pulling out of Briton just as Caius predicted. The colony is growing along with Caius and Varrus'private,illegal army and fort. Caius' son, Picus, is advancing in rank in the Roman army.The Seneca family is still looking for Varrus to punish him for his crimes against them. The Celts and the Romans are coming together for the birth of the first true Britons. <br />Excalibur is born.<br />If you enjoyed all the battles,weapons,politics and religion in the first of the Camulod Chronicles, you won't be disappointed here. The story remains &quot;real&quot; while blending the myth of the Authurian legend within these pages.	2001-07-07

The book is written from the eyes of a Roman soldier, Varrus, at the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire. Varrus meets Caius saving Caius' life while on duty in Africa. Varrus discovers Caius is to be his commander in Briton. A strong bond of friendship grows between the soldiers and Caius shares his dream with Varrus of starting his own colony in Briton. The end is coming, and once the Romans pull out of Briton, it's each man for himself to defend against the Saxons, Hiberians, and Scotii. <br />Jack Whyte has filled this book with plenty of military tactics, battles, politics and religion at the end of the 4th century to keep this book &quot;real&quot;. He also introduces us to the birth of new weapons and defenses.     This was the book I've been looking for ages to read. Fabulous!	2001-06-30

He'll dig deep into your mind, find the very thing that frightens you the most and use it to terrify, right before he makes a meal out of you.  Richard's not certain exactly how he came to be, how old he is, or even if there's anyone else like him in the world, but he prides himself on keeping his city clean of the homeless, prostitutes, and other riff-raff. Who really notices these people are missing anyway?<br /> Simon does.<br />  Simon's just interupted Richard feeding on his homeless  friend Phil. Simon can't believe what he's seeing and Richard wants Simon to forget what he saw. Maybe a little scare might keep Simple Simon quiet... and maybe not. <br />   Just when I thought I had had enough of vampires, Jack Ellis gave a new turn of the screw. Very entertaining.	2001-04-13

This has to be the only amusing (as in laughable) books about a serial killer I ever read!<br />   Zach Tully has decide to retire from the LAPD after his wife and son's death. He's been offered a job as sheriff in Eternity, a small town in the mountains of California that relies on tourists for their bread and butter.The town boasts of their own little stonehenge on Icehouse mountain. A circle of rocks that has a mind altering wave of energy emitting from within. There also been reports of UFO activity and Bigfoot sightings.There are lunatics from Shady Pines sanitarium and a serial killer running loose too.<br />    If Tully had done his homework on Eternity he would have gone elsewhere.<br />          In my own warped sense of humor, here's were the tragic comedy starts. The serial killer has no preference it seems in who he kills or how it's done. Before Tully gets a break from the scene of one crime, there's a report of another murder. Tully, who is reputed as a serial killer specialist having caught 2 back in LA, just can't figure this mystery out fast enough.  I thought by the time I finished this book, everyone in the town would be dead. I suppose that would have narrowed the suspects down. The serial killer can't believe Tully can't figure it out either. Especially with all the clues he keeps leaving him.  Very entertaining. Not for the squeamish.	2001-04-12

It's no wonder why her father beat her. I really hated this character. I forced myself to finish this book. <br />  Princess Bera has 12 brothers, 9 who have wound up in Drust's dungeon. Her remaining brothers have decided to use Bera as a prize. Whoever can free her brothers from their prison  will marry Bera.Bera, being the overaged tomboy she is, decides to try and free them herself.Disguising herself as a weaver Bera gains employment Drust's castle.<br />  Curran,the Dark Warrior,is also employed at Drust's castle.

Curran longs for the prestige marrying Bera will bring him. <br />   Trouble between Bera and Curran start immediately. Curran thinks she a boy hiding under her cape. Possible competition for the princess. Bera slowly realizes what Curran is after. Marriage to him is out of the question, so Bera must release her brother's alone.<br />  There is something that wasn't quite right with this book. The month is December. Much of the food supply at Bera's castle has been stolen by Viking raiders. Children are starving to death. A few weeks later there's suddenly enough food for a feast. Also, Durst is portrayed as an addlepate at the beginning of the book. He's unable to make a decision without his wife's help. His character gets a new personality futher in the book. <br />  This book is not on my recommedation list.	2001-03-11

The way Mr. Piccirilli jumps back and forth in time, through the character's flashbacks, and the nightmare scenes, can make your head spin.
