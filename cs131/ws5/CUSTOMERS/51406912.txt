Having heard so much about this saga-type novel I sought it eagerly and finally broke down and bought it via amazon uk (after a long, fruitless hunt stateside). Rather expensive for the copy I managed to secure (not the one featured on this page). And it had lots of typos and editing problems. But the book was worth it in the end. The tale of Orm Tostesson and \\"friends\\", it follows the adventures of this typical late tenth century viking through nearly all the high-points of vikingdom in the period. From raids and servitude on the coasts of Moorish Spain, to visits with Irish monks and dinner with the Danish King, Harald Bluetooth, and his assorted guests, including no less a worthy than Styrbiorn Olafsson, the Jomsviking and claimant to the Swedish throne about whom E. R. Eddison wrote so brilliantly in his own viking novel, STYRBIORN THE STRONG, this book takes us through all the paces. Orm ends up with a very noble wife living in a backwater part of Scandinavia (the borderlands between Sweden and medieval Denmark) but even there he gets no peace since his enemies and adventures pursue him. And in his maturity another and final adventure comes his way when he is summoned to the eastern reaches of far Gaardarike (the country that was to become Russia) to claim an \\"inheritance\\" of great value. Along the way, Orm makes some good friends, some bad enemies, participates in some (but by no means all) of the great events of viking history in that period, and finally mellows to become a better man who embraces the new way of thinking while yet feeling at home in the old.<br /><br />I did think the book a bit too episodic though this is no indictment of it since the sagas themselves are nearly always such and the \\"voice\\" smacks very much of the sagaman's art. However, a close reading makes this very clearly a modern novel for the humor is quite bracing and alone marks this tale out as one of ours and not one from an earlier time. I especially appreciated Orm's hypochondria, despite his courage in the face of battle, a very human and humorous touch! And the fighting is all very realistic, no great superhuman feats of derring do (except occasionally as we find in the real sagas). Some of the literary technniques used, besides the marvelous sense of tongue-in-cheek humor, are also quite contemporary. I did think the tale a bit slow in places, especially at the beginning, and rather more predictable than not.<br /><br />And, more, it is not, in my opinion the best of the viking or saga novels despite what others have said here. For tautness and action, none have yet done it better, in my opinion, than H. Rider Haggard with ERIC BRIGHTEYES. For the pure poetry of style, Eddison's STYRBIORN THE STRONG still has my vote. And for the resounding greatness of the tale and the power to move, no modern author has ever penned a better saga novel than Hope Muntz did with THE GOLDEN WARRIOR. But Bengtsson did a very nice job and deserves five stars for it. I take my hat off to him and to those here whose reviews obliged me to obtain and read this fine viking tale.<br /><br />By the way, there are a whole slew of good books out there for those into vikings and historical adventure, including a brand new one by Jeff Janoda called SAGA: A NOVEL OF MEDIEVAL ICELAND which details the events surrounding one of the most intriguing episodes in Eyrbyggja Saga (one of the most renowned of the original Norse sagas). It tells the story of a great feud between two chieftains over a little piece of forested land in an Iceland in which wood was as precious as gold. Other good ones include Cecelia Holland's very modern and psychological TWO RAVENS, a glimpse into the hot-house environment of an Icelandic farm, and Jane Smiley's THE GREENLANDERS which tells of the final days of the the Norse settlement in Greenland as the cold and Eskimos close in around the settlers. And if you still have any patience and want more, perhaps you'd want to try my own small effort, THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA, which I wrote to be the saga I'd always wished had been written and preserved about the Norse excursions to North America.<br /><br />All, I believe, are available in some form or another on-line.

US	51406912	RWJSBVGKIHO85	B0007DSH8W	685952527	The Golden Warrior: The Story of Harold and William	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Best of Breed	I reviewed this book once some time back but amazon apparently cleared it off so the original text is now lost. Still, Hope Muntz' tale of Harold and William and their epic tug-of-war for the throne of England which ended in the bloody Battle of Hastings in 1066 is worth writing about again. I'm a lover of historical fiction and have never found any book in that vein better than this one. Written in a terse saga-style which evokes the original time and place of the events recounted, THE GOLDEN WARRIOR offers a time-warp experience which puts us directly in the medieval world on the eve of the final fall of the last of the English kings. Some have found the style of the text a bit off-putting and distant in its early stage but I have never found anyone who, once having read beyond the cool, objective saga-like beginning, has failed to admire the book at the end.<br /><br />If there are failings, and there are, they revolve around Muntz' portrayal of Harold, Earl of Wessex and later King of the English, as a man who is almost too good, too perfect to be believed. And yet he is vividly brought to life here, along with an entire cast of brilliantly rendered folk including his beloved common-law wife, Edith Swan Neck, and his relentless rival and, finally, foe, William of Normandy. In fact it is William who seems more fully shaped, though Harold, in the end, is the one we cry for. And cry we do, or at least I did, finding tears on my cheeks when I came to the final battle . . . and this more than once. There are not many books, I think, which can do this but here is one which does it over and over again.<br /><br />For those who love historical fiction, especially set in medieval England, and for those who admire the old sagas or tales of vikings and such, this book is to be sought and treasured. But it is less an adventure than a tale of real people in serious times. The fall of Harold has never been better told than in this veritable English Iliad and I cannot urge it strongly enough. But if you've already read it or if you have no luck in finding it, you might try another which, while not quite as good (I regret to admit) may also be of interest to readers of this one. It's THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA by Stuart W. Mirsky, also available on-line and currently in print.

After the other kingdoms, including Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia had fallen, there was only Alfred's Wessex and Alfred, a somewhat prissy churchman, seemed the least likely of English kings to hold them off. But he proved a surprise to his contemporaries and, of course, to the Danes.<br /><br />This tale tracks an English lord, an ealdorman, who is snatched from home and hearth at the tender age of ten in the course of a Danish raid on his father's coastal holdings and subsequently reared as a Dane. Coming of age in the warlike culture of the vikings, young Uthred Uthredsson must balance competing loyalties to his adopted Danish father and his English heritage. This first volume in a projected series carries Uthred to King Alfred and his first big decision, and then back again into the jaws of destiny.<br /><br />There is not much of a story here . . . just lots of fighting and running (or sailing) about. But it's all well told and keeps the reader with Uhtred all the way. The book suffers from a certain thinness in characterization though. None of the players are particularly memorable, not even Uhtred, our protagonist. And Bernard Cornwell spends an awful lot of time giving us details of time and place, showing off his extensive research. But he makes it all work.<br /><br />I liked this one much better than I liked the first in his Warlord series, The Winter King (I never read the other two in that series because the first just failed to move me). That earlier one was about the Romano-Celt, Arthur, in his legendary fight to hold back the Saxon tide and defend the Celtic land of Britain. But, of course, as we all know Arthur lost despite his brief moment of glory when he defeated the Saxons in a series of big battles. This one, on the other hand, is about the descendants of those temporarily defeated Saxons, now firmly established in the land they conquered after Arthur, as they struggle to defend themselves against new invaders from their old homeland, their cousins the Danes.<br /><br />Of course, the Danes were among the earliest vikings so this one is basically a viking tale and there's a great deal more historical information to work with in telling it, including the record left behind by the English clerics of the period, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which reports the earliest invasions of Saxon leaders like Hengest and Horsa and takes us right up to later viking times.<br /><br />But if you really like viking tales, as I do, there are lots of others out there, some better than this one. Among my favorites are [[ASIN:B000ESQ3KO The Golden Warrior: The Story of Harold and William]]  by Hope Muntz, about the struggles of Harold, the last English king, against William of Normandy for the English throne, and the recently published [[ASIN:0897335686 Saga: A Novel of Medieval Iceland]] by Jeff Janoda. This one brilliantly retells a fascinating tale found in the Eyrbyggja Saga, one of the most famous of the sagas of old Iceland. Both are powerful novels in the old Norse saga tradition and either one has Cornwell's new entry beat. But The Last Kingdom is a decent read, too, and better than some of Cornwell's other efforts.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]hose temporarily defeated Saxons, now firmly established in the land they conquered after Arthur, as they struggle to defend themselves against new invaders from their old homeland, their cousins the Danes.

It finally came and I plunged right in. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Jeff Janoda has written a fine piece of fiction, moving and powerful and true to the feel and spirit of the old sagas. As a writer of this sort of fiction myself (well, I've written one novel along these lines, anyway), I came to this one with some preconceptions, some personal prejudices. Indeed, I would not have approached the material as Janoda did, preferring to hew a closer line to the original saga voice. But Janoda won me over. While writing with a markedly modern sensibility and retaining the modern novelistic conventions, many of which stray far afield from the old saga techniques, Janoda brilliantly evoked the older saga form from which this novel arises.<br /><br />Here is the story of two Icelandic chieftains as Arnkel Thorolfsson struggles to increase his influence and standing at the expense of another chieftain, Snorri Thorgrimsson, known as Snorri the Priest in the literature, that sly Icelander who appears in so many of the great sagas ([[ASIN:0140447695 Njal's Saga (Penguin Classics)]], [[ASIN:0140442189 Laxdaela Saga (Penguin Classics)]]). This particular tale is from [[ASIN:0140445307 Eyrbyggja Saga (Penguin Classics)]] and is only one of several interwoven plots found there. But Janoda has teased it out and put flesh on the bare saga bones, creating a rich and compelling modern novel of real human beings contending with one another in a harsh and unforgiving land. In the process he has recreated that world in all the rich detail and grim coloration that is only limned in the traditional sagas.<br /><br />The beauty of what he's done is seen from the start as we enter the mind and heart of Ulfar Freedman, former slave of a local farmer who ekes out his livelihood on a holding that lies precariously adjacent to Arnkel Thorolfsson's steading and that of Arnkel's father, the brutal and vindictive Thorolf Lamefoot. Arnkel has his chieftainship as the result of a deal in which his father, Thorolf, sold Ulfar his property in order to buy Arnkel his position (chieftainships could be bought and sold in old Iceland). But Arnkel, who is not only proud and fierce but a good deal cleverer than his father, sees that his chieftainship came at a very great cost, the break-up and diminution of Thorolf's land holdings, thus impairing Arnkel's future inheritance. Arnkel is not prepared to pay that price and wants his full inheritance back. In fact, Thorolf, Arnkel's father, actually gained his formerly vast landholdings by killing Arnkel's grandfather in a duel after brutalizing and abandoning Arnkel's mother, the old man's proud and arrogant daughter, Gudrid. Gudrid, for her part, desperately wants her father's lands back in their entirety, too, wishing only ill on Thorolf, her former husband and tormentor, and has raised Arnkel with these things in mind.<br /><br />And thus the hapless and somewhat timid Ulfar finds himself an unwitting pawn in a struggle that pits Arnkel against his father, and both of them against Ulfar's own former master, Thorbrand and his six sons. Though neighbors of Arnkel godhi, the Thorbrandssons are aligned with the famous Snorri of Helgafell, in hopes of counterbalancing Arnkel's growing strength in the district. Old Thorbrand, Ulfar's former master, also has designs on Ulfar's farm since, under Icelandic law, it reverts to him as the former master, if Ulfar dies without an heir. But Ulfar has found himself a wife and has thus inadvertently set in motion the wheels that will grind him into dust between these harsh men.<br /><br />The story unfolds with much greater focus and depth than is found in the original sagas and this is part of its genius. Janoda has found what may very well be the true story of human struggle, in its endless complexity, that lay beneath what is merely a brief sub-plot in the original Eyrbyggja Saga. There the story is tersely told. It's not always clear who has done what to whom, or why. But Janoda has fleshed out the events with real people including Auln, Ulfar's betrayed wife and Halla, the arrogant daughter of Arnkel who has inherited the domineering persona of her grandmother Gudrid but who can't help desiring Thorbrand's youngest son, Illugi.<br /><br />The complex game plays out as these people strive for primacy over one another, destroying lives and hope for those around them in the process. The sagas are wonderful in the richness of the stories they have to tell and it's Janoda's great strength that he has found the rich vein of human greed, folly and striving that is buried deep within the best of them. Here he has dug out the ore and refined it to purest narrative gold. If you like sagas and the novels that derive from them, this is one of the best.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]rbyggja Saga.

I planned to write a pithy review of this book and move on, but when I saw some of the negative comments here I decided to offer a bit more than that. One reader here takes the author, Gary Greenberg, to task for indulging in historical speculation. But THAT is the point, isn't it? Of course we have no outside material to rely on to refute or alter the biblical tale that has come down to us. But Greenberg's point is obviously to look at the text itself, in light of its extensive inconsistencies, redundancies and apparent errors, to try to sort it all out. What he succeeds in doing is not telling us the way it really was but rather how it might have been, constructing an alternative scenario which attempts to straighten out the peculiarities in the original text. And these are legion.<br /><br />We're told, for instance, that Saul was made king at two different times in two different ways, once during a lottery conducted at a tribal gathering and once after he heroically defeats Nahash of Ammon on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Saul falls down and prophesies twice, too, once early on in his career and once later, and each instance, it is suggested, is why the proverb \\"Is Saul too among the prophets?\\" came into common usage.<br /><br />Samuel breaks with Saul twice, too, in very similar circumstances: the first time during Saul's conflict with the Philistines, when he takes certain priestly prerogatives for himself (i.e., sacrificing to the Lord before Samuel, who is late, can arrive to officiate); the second time when Saul fails to follow Samuel's instruction to slay ALL the Amalekites including their women, children and beasts . . . in fact Saul spares the king and cattle to sacrifice later and Samuel announces that Saul will lose his kingdom because of this failure to fully effect the genocide he was ordered to commit.<br /><br />But the oddities don't stop there. Saul meets David for the first time twice, too, and on the second occasion he and Abner, his general, have no idea who the young shepherd boy, David, is . . . even though we were previously told David was a heroic man of war inducted into Saul's entourage for his musical talents and to serve as the king's personal armor bearer. But suddenly he's a boy again and Saul and Abner have no idea who he is?<br /><br />Of course we read that David slew Goliath in the original text but that same text also reports, much later in David's career, that Elkhanan, one of King David's champions, was the slayer of Goliath. In Chronicles, the slain Philistine warrior killed by Elkhanan is reported as Goliath's brother instead, though his description matches the terminology in the earlier descriptions in \\"Samuel I and II\\" of Goliath (same spear \\"like a weaver's beam\\", etc.).<br /><br />When Saul hunts the fugitive David, we get two remarkably similar incidents in which David sneaks up on Saul and has the opportunity to kill him but magnanimously refrains from doing so. In the course of his flight from Saul, David also manages to run a protection racket which culminates in the death of a well off local farmer with David marrying the widow, who just happens to have the same name as David's sister (the only times this name is ever found in the Bible) who, other textual allusions suggest, may have been a daughter of Nahash of Ammon. If David's sister is related to Nahash, then what about David, himself?David, of course, conveniently inherits all the farmer's property along with his wife.<br /><br />When Saul dies on the battlefield in his last stand against the Philistines, we're given two distinctly different reports of his demise, one described as a suicide, the other a mercy killing by a wandering Amalekite  . . . who shouldn't be around anyway since the text in \\"I Samuel\\" reports that Saul killed all the Amalekites at the behest of Samuel, except for their king and beasts . . . and Samuel subsequently slew the king . . . so where did this Amalekite, and others who appear in thestory afterwards, come from?<br /><br />David's own story is just as jumbled. In the wake of Saul's death and David's consolidation of the kingdom, David seeks out and protects Jonathan's son, Saul's grandson, who is reported to be the last surviving scion of Saul's family. But later on in \\"II Samuel\\" we're told that a famine struck the land and that David, trying to undo it by appeasing the Lord, determines that the famine is the Lord's punishment because of harm done to the Gibeonites by Saul. No explanation is ever offered as to why the Lord waited so long to punish the land for Saul's alleged offense (which had not previously been reported or described). But the solution David hits on is to deliver the remaining sons and grandsons of Saul up to the Gibeonites so they can kill them. Where did they come from if Jonathan's son was Saul's last surviving male relative?<br /><br />Of course, David shows his true colors more than once when his enemies conveniently die at the hands of others (usually his general and cousin, Joab) despite David's repeated regrets and proclamations of innocence. Most interestingly, when the killers are outsiders, like the wandering Amalekite who claimed to have dispatched Saul at his own request or the Gibeonites who assassinate David's rival for kingship, Saul's son Ishbaal, David usually has them executed on the spot . . . before they can tell their tale to anyone else.<br /><br />So the story of David as the bible tells it is full of holes. What Gary Greenberg has endeavored to do is sort through it all and reconstruct the tale in a way that makes sense and reduces or eliminates the extensive discrepancies. Like any good criminal attorney, which he apparently is, Greenberg reorders the tale, knocks out the parts that seem illogical or without support and tells us what he thinks most likely occurred. The reader, like a jury, must look at the reconstructed tale and weigh it against the official tale because there is no other evidence, one way or the other, to decide between them.<br /><br />While I was not entirely convinced, I came away with a sense that Greenberg's reconstruction makes far more sense than the discrepancy-ridden narrative in the original text. For years I've wrestled with all the confusions and duplications in this story and tried to sort them out. I just got bogged down in the morass that is \\"Samuel I and II.\\" But Greenberg broke through that logjam with his carefully thought out alternative scenario. If Greenberg's suggestion that the descriptions of the Philistine giants or of Goliath's sword are metaphors doesn't quite ring true, much of the rest does. David's odd good fortune at the fortuitous deaths of so many of his adversaries and his peculiar alliance with the Philistines as they march toward their final confrontation with Saul's forces on Gilboa speak more about the character of the man behind the events than the apologists and spin doctors of biblical narrative ever could.<br /><br />I agree that Greenberg left some unfortunate errors in the book including an all too frequent confusion of \\"Saul\\" with \\"Samuel\\" and even \\"David\\" (in at least one instance). Other typos also caught me up short. But on balance this is a very credible, if speculative, reconstruction of a tale that has too long mesmerized credulous readers. Greenberg's David is not a particularly nice guy and is very much a Type A despot, the kind of tinpot dictator that still besets so much of the world today.<br /><br />SWM<br />[[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]ry is just as jumbled.

In fact, though I tried two or three times with some of the earlier books in the series (my wife and kids adore them so we have them all), I was never able to get into them. Their world and situations just seemed uninteresting to me, though they are obviously utterly fascinating to millions around the world (including my immediate family). So I picked this one up when my family members were done with it, hoping to see what the fuss is all about.<br /><br />This time the book held my attention (whether because I was finally more prepared to attend to it or because it just seemed more mature or more interesting to me, or what not, I don't know). Suffice it to say that while I never found myself thinking about the story or characters afterwards, or rushing to get back to reading the book after I'd put it down, it clearly kept pulling me along whenever I picked it up.<br /><br />Some of the elements were a bit tiresome (e.g., the quidditch games and their \\"importance\\" to students and faculty) and some elements rather peculiar (like the notion that, even though a vast life and death struggle between good and evil for the future of the so-called wizarding world was underway, the students still had to go off to classes, do their homework, take their exams, play quidditch, etc.). But perhaps that's all part of the book's attraction, this odd juxtaposition of the ordinary with the fantastic and dangerous. On balance, the story elements were handled quite nicely and most of the book was a remarkably easy and pleasant read, a little tiresome in the middle, unless you're keen on quiddtich and teen crushes and infatuations, but fast moving and well-paced at the end.<br /><br />And, though the tale's just a bit too long and episodic for my tastes, the blending of mystery with adventure that Ms. Rowling pulls off keeps things popping.

Martin Cruz Smith does a wonderful job of conjuring up this lost pre-war world of depravity, dissolution and Japanese honor, and of creating a sense of what it might have been like to be completely enmeshed in that culture, so alien to us and yet so familiar to his protagonist, Niles.<br /><br />The book actually opens with the young Harry, son of Southern Baptist missionaries and now a Tokyo school boy, fleeing from his schoolmates in an eerie game of 47 Ronin which puts Harry on the receiving end of his friends' relentless blows. As in the best novels, the seeds of the rest of the tale are all found here, for the opening scene will eerily reach its denoument, years later, as Harry struggles for his life amidst a militant Japanese society bent on establishing itself in the modern world. In the meantime, Harry is tied to a lover, a bohemian Japanese woman he barely understands, as he philanders with the British ambassador's wife and struggles to stay afloat amidst the intrigue of competing Japanese factions. The adherents of the Japanese navy and army are in seeming conflict, despite the superficial loyalty to the emperor they share, while the Tokyo police are shadowing him closely.<br /><br />At the same time, a skilled Japanese swordsman, Colonel Ishigami, has returned from the Chinese campaign intent on taking vengeance on Harry for a loss of face he caused him some years before in China where Harry had been doing a little blackmarketeering. There's a secret plan to develop synthetic oil and a question of who may have been stealing oil shipments to the island nation that Harry must decipher for some of the parties and all the while he's got to nail down a way to get out of the country, without giving his exit plans away to a government that wants to keep him there and a lover who threatens to kill him if he goes.<br /><br />This is a deep and complex tale and one that is compelling from beginning to end. For a first class adventure, in the old film noir Humprhey Bogart mold, you won't find better. I don't usually offer glowing praise about the books I read like this, but when they hold me to them and keep calling me back till late in the evening, what else can I do? As an author of a very different sort of adventure, The King of Vinland's Saga, about vikings in North America in the eleventh century, I know how hard it can be to keep a story moving with this kind of power. Martin Cruz Smith is an author with much to teach and well worth reading.<br /><br />SWMtion of who may have been stealing oil shipments to the island nation that Harry must decipher for some of the parties and all the while he's got to nail down a way to get out of the country, without giving his exit plans away to a government that wants to keep him there and a lover who threatens to kill him if he goes.

The earlier two books were great tales but suffered from a certain disappointing similarity and a jumpiness of narrative which took us back and forth among the different characters and various sub-plots. This time, though, things are a bit different. There are no battles in the bush or safaris except for a brief moment early on when white hunter and protagonist, Anton Rider, is wrapping one up, just before lighting out for Cairo to woo back his estranged wife Gwen, who has relocated there after attending medical school and becoming a physician.<br /><br />On arrival in Cairo, Rider finds Gwen playing mistress to a slippery French archeologist and unwilling to reconcile with him because of his adventurous ways. Meanwhile his grown son, Wellington, and nearly grown son, Denby, are keen to sign up to fight the Jerries and Eyeties in the newly developing war, causing still another rift between Gwen and Anton.<br /><br />Their proper British friend, the somewhat incompetent Lord Adam Penfold, rounds out this little group which is again bound together by their common friendship with, and devotion to, the Goan dwarf Olivo Fonseca Alavedo, the very kinky and always scheming capitalist miser with the heart of gold who keeps them all in the chips despite their unworldly ways. Olivio has his family of five beautiful daughters by his off-stage African wife (for some reason, throughout all the trials and tribulations of this group, she never makes an appearance) and his one dwarf son (the spitting image of his dad . . . though why he is the only one to inherit dwarfism while his daughters are all perfect specimens is never addressed or explained). Their old friendly enemy, Ernst von Decken is there, too. He's high tailing it to Rommel in North Africa to salve the pain of having been on the losing German side in East Africa during World War I. This time, relying on a peg leg to replace a foot he lost in the prior book, A Cafe on the Nile, he is quickly inducted into Rommel's inner circle and ready to beat the \\"Englanders\\" at last.<br /><br />Anton, of course, is keen to do his duty for a Britain he left as a lad of 18 and has not seen since, even as Wellington, born and raised in Africa, enlists to do his. Gwen, rather annoyed by it all, flees Cairo for Alexandria to do her duty there caring for the wounded in the overcrowded hospitals, while Olivio has uncovered a secret on one of his landholdings that brings him into conflict with a certain French archeologist, as well as the Egyptian authorities. While Anton and Wellington are off blasting Eyties and Jerries, Olivio must outwit the man who is out to steal what he has found and who will stop at nothing, including assassination, to get his way.<br /><br />As before, we are treated to a generous helping of sexual coupling, though it's less off the beaten path this time than in the prior books, as Wellington falls for Olivio's surviving eldest daughter, Saffron, and Anton cavorts with Ernst's American wife who has paused to dally a bit in Egypt on her way home to the states in the wake of Ernst's desertion of her for the glories of a dreamed of German victory. Anton leads his long range desert reconnaisance unit deep into Libya, enemy territory controlled by the Italians and Rommel, while Wellington takes his stand at a little known oasis on the road to Tobruk which Rommel must take if he's to move on and seize Alexandria, Egypt and all the rest of the oil rich Middle East.<br /><br />As before, there's lots of action and good fun for those who want to lose themselves in a 1940's style adventure set in the exotic locale of North Africa. Bull does a marvelous job of conjuring up the world though I think, this time, he was a little too specific in the technical details as he lists the various vehicles on the two sides interminably andhas Penfold continue to read newspaper headlines giving us the broader events of the day. Bull notes in his afterword that he did quite a bit of research in the old newspapers and, through Penfold, he seems keen to show us how much he took away.<br /><br />The downside in this tale, though, remains the characters. While sharply drawn and generally interesting, they have no real depth and never seem to show any growth. Anton is still the heroic hunter cum adventurer, aphrodisiac to the ladies but a fish out of water with his own wife, Gwen. Lord Penfold is still the dull, impractical and sincere British aristocrat and Olivio is still the consumate schemer. Ernst remains the somewhat honorable schemer and lout he has always been, despite the losses he has taken including the missing foot.<br /><br />The Goan dwarf, Olivio, still takes his hits but, as always, knows how to hit back in a remarkably brutal way, though his brutality is surprisingly muted this time out compared to what we got in the first two books. Despite the deep losses he sustains in his battle of wits with his new enemy, he seems surprisingly unmoved by it all, thriving, rather, on the vengeance he is able to conceive and implement despite the loss of some of those who are closest to him. He's been blown up and nearly burned to death many times before, of course, and given the health problems Bull tells us beset him, it's hard to imagine that he's still alive, still scheming and still taking revenge after it all. But this story is not meant to be realistic. It's a fantastic world of adventure masquerading as reality and in that it does its job. If you want to lose yourself in a fast paced tale of adventure in a far off time and place, among strange and quaintly alien peoples, then this book is right up your alley. I generally like my historical adventures set a bit further back in time, myself, but as an author of one of these ([[ASIN:0738801518 The King of Vinland's Saga]]), I respect a good job when I see it. And Bartle Bull has written an adventure worth losing oneself in. I lost myself for a couple of days, reading it right through to the end without a break.

He comes across as self-absorbed, ego-driven and immature; author of not only a body of respected literary works but of his own downfall and misfortunes.<br /><br />I'm not familiar enough with Fitzgerald's life to comment on the credibility of this presentation but it rings true enough, even though it does little to enhance the man's reputation. That he could write and was one of the better ones in the America of the twentieth century is beyond dispute. But his works often smack of that same immaturity and self-centeredness that drove him to fritter away his health, his talents and the money he earned from these. His stories are often marred by crass commercialization as he strove, through them, to maintain a lifestyle that was unrealistic and beyond his capacity to maintain.<br /><br />Zelda, his wife and fellow traveler in the life of dissipation they had jointly adopted, went mad and Fitzgerald himself fell into alcoholism as his literary skills faltered. In the end he was insulting and bumbling his way through Hollywood, struggling to make a comeback as a screenwriter, a milieu for which he seems to have been quite unsuited, and falling more and more deeply into alcoholism. Even after having made something of a financial (if not an artistic) comeback in pre-World War II Hollywood he seemed unable to live within the means this afforded him and continued to fritter away his resources, failing to cut critical expenses (expensive private schools, parties and limousines) and put money aside for the less prosperous periods that might follow.<br /><br />Meyers' writing, as he describes all this, is a bit dry and I found his frequent repetitions of the same events and quotes throughout the book somewhat tiresome. But on balance he does a decent job of documenting and describing the literary fall from grace of a writer who never seemed to have it in him to grow up in a world that demanded he do just that. One doesn't get much of a sense of the grandeur and accomplishment of Fitzgerald's work here but at least we see the man, however unpalatable that is, in the end.<br /><br />SWMhe do just that.

A friend of mine handed me this one while I was convalescing and I loved it at the start. The coming of age tale of an art student during his first year of college, it had me laughing myself silly at times and greedily lapping up the aphorisms and insights into mid-twentieth century life that it offered. All the self-absorbed leftish cant of our current academic elite may be found aborning here, in the person of the enigmatic Gary Cooperesque arts instructor Winter Sorbeck and in the antagonistically brilliant arts student, who despises the ordinary, little Miss Himmillsy Dodd. But about two thirds of the way through the book bogs down, particularly when our hero gets the goods on his arrogant professor, and the story starts to trail off to an inconclusive and remarkably unsatisfying end. Sorbeck, who seemed so powerful a character at the outset comes across as a bit of a self-destructive fool, though it seems we are not intended to take him for that by the author, and Miss Dodd solves the class's final problem in a way that only the narrator seems able to grasp. Most peculiar of all is her complete indifference, and even anger, toward our hero for having saved her from the tender ministrations of the madcap frat boys whom she has thoughtlessly baited while in their lair. Instead of gratitude for having been whisked away from the hulk who had her at his mercies, she appears genuinely annoyed with her rescuer instead. Are we to presume she actually sought the experience of being raped or meant to sacrifice herself on the altar of these \\"Greeks\\" in some odd form of performance art? The enraged demolition of Baby Laveen which follows her rescue seems to take all the sense out of the tale and the end leaves one merely scratching one's head. After having recommended this one to others as I read it, I was forced to recant at the end. Who really cares about these self-absorbed, self-satisfied college kid rebels who are so convinced they're better than everyone else anyway? As to the graphics (since the author is a graphics designer by trade), I have to add that I found some of the cover art in my edition more distracting than meaningful and the technique of rolling text over from page to page altogether unhelpful. If you want someone to read something then print it so reading is easy.

US	51406912	R3PAFOVMEZMILN	0385506031	519808491	Pride of Carthage: A Novel of Hannibal	Books	4	4	7	N	N	A Vivid Recreation of the Ancient Mediterranean World	The best part of this book is how vividly it brings the world of ancient Rome and Carthage to life. Although it's a bit slow in the early parts (though it does kick off brilliantly with a prologue that grabs you as a reluctant Carthaginian becomes a hero almost by accident during the siege of an Iberian town and gets his first glimpse of Hannibal Barca himself), the tale only gains real steam when Hannibal finally picks his fight with Rome and heads off over the Alps to trounce his enemies in their own backyard.<br /><br />But Hannibal, brilliant military commander that he is, lacks the support of a powerful state behind him to equal Rome. While he defeats the Romans at every turn on the Italian peninsula and easily out thinks their military leaders, he is unable to wear the Romans down. For every army of theirs he destroys, they manage to raise and train new ones and replace their generals to boot. In the end it looks like Hannibal's great error was playing a waiting game. His own city, Carthage, riven by factions and infigthing and governed by pusillanimous merchant princes, repeatedly refuses to send him reinforcements and his army, however brilliantly led, gradually withers on the Italian peninsula. Still, he keeps winning his battles but his delay in taking the fight to the gates of Rome itself proves fatal as the Romans finally find a military leader in their midst who is capable of rising to Hannibal's own level of generalship.<br /><br />In the meantime, Hannibal's own generals, including his brothers, are systematically decimated since his brothers, particularly, are not up to his military level on their own. Eventually, the new Roman commander, Publius Scipio, takes the war to Carthage, first by capturing their Iberian capital, New Carthage and then by invading Africa itself. Threatened by Scipio, the Carthaginian Council, who failed to support Hannibal at the height of his successes, commands him to return to Africa to defend their city. Never defeated in Italy and faced with no prospect of taking down Rome as his own forces attrit, Hannibal must abandon his war, managing a smooth and effective withdrawal but with a much reduced force.<br /><br />Arriving in Africa he is sent off to face Scipio without adequate support from Carthage once more. But Scipio has been working assiduously to undermine the home alliances of the Carthaginians (something Hannibal never managed to do in any signficant way to the Romans) and has built himself an effective fighting force to back up his demands. Facing his brilliant youthful opponent, Hannibal seems burnt out and tired, utterly devastated by the loss of his family members and closest generals that the war has cost him. He has lost his edge and Scipio, with a roughly equal sized force, proves a daunting opponent.<br /><br />Durham brings this all to brilliant life, even if he does overdo the characters at times (too many to follow without sapping some of the narrative's energy) and the sub-plots (my preference is for more streamlined tales rather than those that jump about so radically). Hannibal's brothers did not come fully to life for me either. Moreover, one does get a glimpse of the real and largely unpleasant nature of these Carthagnians (crucifixion and torturing their unsuccesful generals to death are staples of their policy while worship of gods demanding human sacrifice characterize their religious beliefs). It's kind of hard, in the end, to root for them. Still, Durham manages to make them sympathetic without hiding their serious cultural flaws (not much worse than the Romans, of course, but they are a decidedly more self-indulgent and less sturdy people, fighting their wars with paid mercenaries rather than citizen soldiers, for instance).<br /><br />So this one had its weaknesses and sometimes I put the book aside for a time without a strong inclination to pick it up again. But when I did, I wasn't sorry. The rich world of the ancients is rendered here for us in a way not seen since Flaubert's Salammbo (which tells the story of the mercenary rebellion against Carthage after the first Punic War that was put down by Hannibal's own father a generation earlier).<br /><br />This one is worth it for anyone who enjoys immersion in another time and place.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]ich tells the story of the mercenary rebellion against Carthage after the first Punic War that was put down by Hannibal's own father a generation earlier).

The first third or so of this book was a slog. Nelson writes nicely, particularly when capturing the experience of dying in the midst of a battle, as he does brilliantly, in the book's prologue. I was also taken with his introduction of the book's protagonist, Thomas Marlowe, Virginia planter and former pirate, in the opening sequence of the first chapter. But from there the tale degenerated for me as we follow Marlowe and his lady love and assorted hangers on as they try to cobble together a voyage to sell their tobacco in advance of all others into the English market. The building of a crew and the relationship between Marlowe and Elizabeth, his wife, is rather predictable with Elizabeth being shown as an atypically feisty but loving woman, as capable as her man in business as in the use of salty language, but devoted to him. Very much a nod, I think, to our modern sensibility which demands that our female characters be strong and aggressive in their own right. But not at all likely to have been consistent with the period. Nor, as another here has noted, is it likely that Marlowe would have taken her along with him on a ship bound for the high seas and, in all probability, a stint of dangerous pirating. Yes, there were some female pirates, anomalies to be sure, but Marlowe, if he were worth his salt, would have been unlikely to drag his beloved wife along on such a trip, even if she demanded it of him.<br /><br />Marlowe, who has freed and re-hired his plantation slaves (others here have commented on the peculiarity of THAT for this time period, so I won't say more) collects a crew, half of them freed slaves from his plantation and half local seamen, and takes off with his and his neighbors' tobacco, and his lovely wife Elizabeth, to England. There things finally get a bit hairy and he is almost hanged by an old enemy. Escaping down the Thames in the dark of night, Marlowe and his crew soon find their way to a pirate haven on a small island off the coast of Madagascar and at last the tale begins to gather steam.<br /><br />Though Marlowe seems a little too introspective and sensitive a soul for the kind of man he is said to be, and very much an indecisive fellow, reacting to events as much as leading them, and a bit of a dunderhead for walking into a pirate's lair with his wife at his side, still he comes across as sufficiently sympathetic to be worth worrying about. I read the last half of the book with gusto as the characters, Marlowe included, started to become a might more interesting, especially the little pirate, Lord Yancy. Though something of a caricature, as with the rest of these pirate fellows, he was at least an interesting one.<br /><br />True, the tale continued to have a certain unfortunate predictability about it and the characters were largely stock or mere shadows, never coming fully to life or engaging enough to care about. But the action picks up and is nicely drawn. Though I grew a little tired of the extensive descriptions of shipboard activities and the reliance on the technical jargon of ships, I have to admit that Nelson turns a nice phrase and keeps the pacing well in hand.<br /><br />Because of the taut and engrossing second half, I upped the stars in the amazon rating system for this review by one. The book proved a good read in the end and one worth the time of anyone who likes a good adventure tale. But you'll have to hang in there until the tale gets its sea legs.<br /><br />SWMgascar and at last the tale begins to gather steam. <br /> <br />Though Marlowe seems a little too introspective and sensitive a soul for the kind of man he is said to be, and very much an indecisive fellow, reacting to events as much as leading them, and a bit of a dunderhead for walking into a pirate's lair with his wife at his side, still he comes across as sufficiently sympathetic to be worth worrying about.

I finished it the following morning. That, in itself, says something.<br /><br />The book, a fast paced, many layered tale of an African-American with a day job as head janitor at a local school and an avocation for helping his friends in the ghetto world of mid-1960's Watts in L.A., highlights Walter Mosley's detective character, Ezekiel (Easy) Rawlins, and brilliantly conjures up his world. Called in to help an old friend who's gone from bartender to real estate developer and whose girlfriend's stepson has gone missing, Easy soon stumbles on a complex web of murder and deceit as he begins digging into the Urban Revolutionary Party and the First Men (think Black Panthers here), a group of young black radicals intent on challenging the system they believe holds them down. No naif himself, Easy knows the system all too well, particularly when being rousted by racist cops or manipulated by a special squad, out to shortcircuit the perceived threat of the young revolutionaries. And then there's the set up, inevitable in a book like this. Never far from Easy's troubled mind is his pathologically violent best friend, Mouse, whose penchant for shooting his enemies with deadly accuracy has gotten Easy out of innumerable jams but who has recently been killed himself. Easy is wracked by guilt for his friend's death while worrying about being a father to the two children he's adopted and keeping the beautiful stewardess who has set up housekeeping with him.<br /><br />Easy is juggling all these issues as he digs ever more deeply and somewhat reluctantly into the disappearance of his buddy's girl's son, an oversized, powerful and sometimes violent kid who has been ensnared by the glamor of the revolution and his need to do something important. The size of the kid, alone, makes Easy uneasy as to how he can stop him, once he makes contact, and leads to a remarkably logical if somewhat amoral solution. Meanwhile, Easy has to figure out who murdered whom and help the young idealists he encounters to avoid the snares of a cynical system that means to take them down.<br /><br />The book is tight, the writing vital and fresh. I was sucked right in, enthralled by the easy style, the rich characters and the sleekly plotted tale. Think I'll pick up a few more from Mosley.<br /><br />SWMlogical if somewhat amoral solution.

The book is much more mundane and lacks the mythic resonance achieved by the Kevin Costner directed film. As others here have noted, the screenplay dramatically departs from the characterization of the Charlie Waite character as found in the book while the book's denouement lacks the massive, bloody and life-changing gun battle which gives the film its sense of power and gravitas. On balance, I found the book okay but not particularly compelling or memorable. Of course I have a few bones to pick with the film's screenplay as well, which went on much too long, drawing out the dramatic ending until one barely cared anymore. Costner would have been better off ending strongly, right after the showdown and the destruction it unleashed. Lauran Paine, author of this novel, would have been better off if he could have achieved the sense of mythic resonance the film somehow managed to tease out of this somewhat ordinary tale of conflict between a rich and ruthless cattleman and a couple of unaffiliated cowboys just passing through.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801518 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	2005-01-24
US	51406912	RSK6UGEHMR9Z6	0060534249	223377898	To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World	Books	4	36	43	N	N	Fascinating Tale of Seagoing Technology and Human Enterprise	This is a thoroughgoing and insightful survey of the growth (and the importance of that growth) of British seapower, from its earliest stirrings in the reign of Henry VIII, through its birth on the high seas as an annoying competitor to the Spanish and Portugese for the African slave trade (with not a little piracy thrown in) during Elizabeth I's reign right up to the present. It covers tremendous ground while offering a sometimes microscopic look into the technologies and lifestyles of Britain's seafarers over the centuries.<br /><br />What jumps right out at you from the beginning is how deeply the Royal Navy which, in the nineteenth century, could justly claim to \\"rule the waves,\\" is itself rooted in lawlessness, brutality and the greed of the pirate. Yet Herman keeps it all in perspective and shows us how a better way of thinking, a philosophy of fairness enforced, grew out of this, alongside the gradual increase in British seapower.<br /><br />After a number of false starts and lucky breaks, including successfully (but just barely) avoiding an invasion by a clumsy Spanish admiral and his inattentive monarch, the Elizabethan English were granted a reprieve during which to grow their seafaring prowess. They did this by partly living off the powerful but sluggish annual seagoing tribute caravan called \\"La Flota\\" which kept the Spaniards afloat in gold and silver. But the Spanish King Philip, a micromanager of the worst sort, also seemed to lack a head for finances. He mortgaged his nation ever more deeply into debt as English piracy grew and, eventually, began to take the gold and silver from his galleons before he and his successors could. The result: Spain's fleet stagnated and declined and her ever more ossified civil system fell into decay. Not so the up and coming English.<br /><br />As Spain declined, other seafaring nations waded in to take her place, including the former Spanish dependency, Holland which briefly gave England a run for its money. But the Dutch lacked the resources to keep pace with the English who began to transition from piracy to more staid pursuits. As trade and commerce replaced brigandage, England struggled to protect its ever growing position in a series of wars. When the Dutch faded, France was ready to step in. And France was a more substantial threat to England, the sort that would force the English to finally develop a real navy.<br /><br />But the autocratic French system did not transfer well to the sea, while the initiative and out-of-the-box thinking of piracy and smuggling had bred into England's sea captains a certain savoir faire out on the waves. Along with growing seafaring technology (better gunnery, better ship designs and better logistics for building and supporting their fleets), this enabled the English seamen to consistently best their French challengers despite a number of tricky moments and some real setbacks. The English also managed to eventually develop a savvy officer corps and a system for organizing and moving their ships about on the high seas. Herman introduces us to the line ahead attack mode that the English pioneered and the many other innovations they added including systematic navigational charting, ship to ship signaling, better food and food supply systems, uniforms, etc. While other countries eventually picked up these innovations the English, unlike the Spanish they had long since replaced, kept right on innovating, staying a step ahead of their enemies including the brilliant and ruthless Napoleon who nearly conquered all of Europe and, at one point, seemed primed to move into India, had it not been for his English antagonists and their relentless blockade of Europe's ports as he rushed into Russia with winter descending, imprudently extending his land based supply lines for thousands of miles.<br /><br />Chief among Napoleon's antagonists was the famed English admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson. But just as Herman gives us an unvarnished picture of a brutally dictatorial Bonaparte, so he lets us see Nelson, the greatest British seafaring hero, for what he really was: a skilled, insightful, courageous and innovative commander of ships, who was also reckless and vain and who probably would have ended his life with a much less exalted reputation had he not died in the heat of the battle of Trafalgar (having once again taken more risks than were prudent). Indeed, Herman's Nelson comes across as something of a spoiled adolescent, insatiable for glory and attention and heedless of the risks to others or himself.<br /><br />But Trafalgar was a victory even if, according to Herman, it accomplished nothing since Napoleon had already decided to turn east, and the English, who adored their self-aggrandizing champion who had lost an arm in an early battle and an eye in another, virtually deified him. His recklessness, along with a bit of luck, had stood him in good stead many times in sea battles before this as he had out-brazened enemy commanders while retaining control over his own ships. (One of the ways he did this was through a newly devised ship to ship signaling system.)<br /><br />But Herman also dispassionately lets us see the futility of all the high seas destruction that ship to ship warfare entailed, even as it forged the British navy and helped build an empire. Indeed, it is Herman's contention that Britain' navy made her though what also comes clearly into focus is the fact that external events and the special combination of features that conjoined in the English nation also made the navy. In the end, we get a navy that thrived on its sense of honor and a belief in the value of law, two characteristics which also came to infuse the larger British society as well.<br /><br />Herman doesn't stint on the unpleasant stuff but he shows both sides, the exploratory travels that took Darwin to Galapagos and others to the Arctic, as well as the wars and the slaughter out on the open waves. And it was the British navy, Herman reminds us, that shut down the African slave trade despite its own birth in the pursuit of that abominable business. He also lets us see how the United States grew up in the shadow of the Royal Navy (some day to replace it with even greater global power) as the British became the world's policemen and guardians of its sea lanes.<br /><br />A very worthwhile book, indeed, though I had a few concerns. Chief among these is the humongous number of proofing errors that abound here. Granted it's a substantial read but the editors ought to have done a better job. At some points I found myself noticing omitted words or wrong words or misspelled words on almost every other page. After about half way through I just stopped trying to keep track. But there was one that really stuck, a reference to American Secretary of State James Quincy Adams under the presidency of James Monroe during the establishment of the Monroe Doctrine. As Herman notes, this doctrine was more British than American since the U.S. did not have the fleet to enforce it. Only the British did and had they chosen not to, the American president would have been unable to do it himself. Still there's this reference to the Secretary of State. I recall a John Quincy Adams, not a James. He was the son of President John Adams and went on, himself, to serve as an American president.

Along the way he offers us a view of how he progressed from mere tape reading and betting on price fluctuations on a very short term basis to genuine player, able to \\"run big lines\\" in the market, corner various stocks and other goods and successfully manipulate markets for himself and those who sought this of him, to sell positions that were too big to be absorbed without depressing prices to a level that made such sales untenable. The picture of the markets Livermore sketches here is fascinating as is the glimpse he gives us into how he became good at what he did.<br /><br />He learned, he tells us, that mere tape reading alone, while a useful tool, was not sufficient to make real money in the markets. For that you had to be able to adequately gauge \\"general conditions\\" and correctly bet which way the economy and markets would be moving over a long period of time, i.e., to determine if conditions were bullish or bearish. Then, says Livermore, the key is to move into your positions but only incrementally, testing the waters as you go and never overcommitting. You have to be patient, he says, and only move when you are sure and, once in, if things are going your way, you have to hold your ground and not try to grab quick profits and trade in and out heavily. Value has no part in this since prices move with the enthusiasms or fears of the crowd. So a stock, he asserts, is never too high to buy or too low to sell . . . if the stock price is moving your way. But you have to be prepared to act, he adds, against your normal human inclinations, i.e., to take losses quickly when the market for your positions moves contrary to your expectations. It's better to take the loss and conserve capital, he says, than hang on in vain hope.<br /><br />He played both the long and short sides of the market and was enamoured of the game itself. He tells us it wasn't the money that kept him in it, or at least not the money per se, but rather the sense of accomplishment he derived from being right. The money was the confirmation of that accomplishment. Still Livermore managed to go broke a couple of times in this book (and, as others have pointed out here, he finally died broke after cleaning up as a result of his being bearish in the year leading up to the 1929 crash).<br /><br />While there are lots of intriguing anecdotes here, including the tale of his efforts to come back after a big-time blunder in cotton (which he ascribes to his being mesmerized by a charismatic cotton speculator who bedazzled him into ignoring his own best judgment), there is very little about the people he knew and shaped him, or who he influenced in his turn. We're told about this or that broker, this or that trader and assorted business tycoons. And he mentions his marriage and wife briefly and in passing. But his interests are clearly in the market and in his own thoughts while playing it. I understand from other sources that he was a very private man who did not connect well with other people and that he suffered from bouts of depression. This probably explains the almost total dearth of humanity in the book, except for his own experiences in the market. (It reads, in fact, like a series of \\"as told to\\" interviews, strung together for publication in book form.)<br /><br />Perhaps Livermore's way is really how one gets good at something like stock speculation, to be a totally focused and blindered individual, completely devoted to honing an almost inhuman skill at outguessing the mass of other human beings through the markets. Still, the few personal anecdotes he offers do reverberate and illuminate.<br /><br />It's intriguing tosee how he had to dissemble in order to operate in the crooked \\"bucket shops\\" (where no stocks were ever really bought or sold as customers bet on the next price quotation), or when, coming back from Boston to New York, he stumbled into a small brokerage house and, looking younger than his years, he and a friend were taken for well-off college students instead of the market professionals that Livermore, at least, was fast becoming. In this case, Livermore (or Livingston) takes the poor shop owner (it may have been one of those bucket shops) for a ride until the man regretfully acknowledges they have nearly cleaned him out and asks them to give him a break and just move on. Another time, after the cotton fiasco, Livermore recalls how he was brought back to New York from Chicago (where he'd gone to rebuild his stake) by a big, respectable brokerage house who wrote him a check for $25,000 (real money in those days) and just told him to trade out of their house. Surprised at their largesse, he takes the opportunity they are offering to make a swifter comeback than would otherwise have been possible, but soon finds that they are crimping his trading. Because of his sense of obligation to them, he allows them to do it, forcing him into mistakes that lead to his incurring even greater debt than before. In the end he realizes that he has been brought in for \\"cover\\" since his reputation for \\"running a big line\\" and short selling provides them camouflage as they liquidate the assets of their major customer on the open market, thereby enabling them to avoid driving down the prices of the shares.<br /><br />Livermore comes across as an honorable fellow who, even after declaring bankruptcy to 'free his mind' from creditors so he can trade successfully again, goes out of his way to pay back a million dollars in debt. Of course, the point of declaring bankruptcy is to wipe out those debts. But Livermore tells us that he paid everyone back anyway and that he only went the bankruptcy route to remove the sword of Damocles that seemed to be hanging over his head and hindering his market judgement.<br /><br />In the end I wanted more from the book than it had to give. But as a window into the mind of an enigmatic and remarkably successful \\"stock market operator\\" of the early twentieth century, it was unbeatable. The man gives us his own learning experiences, his insights and his invaluable perspective. True, markets aren't quite like this anymore, driven as they are these days by program trading and international money flows. A line of sixty thousand shares is hardly enough to move most major stock prices on the big board these days, at least not for very long. But the fundamental principles of the markets are hardly likely to have changed. Livermore would certainly have had to play a different game today.

Rothstein came of age within this milieu, a man of vision and immense skill with numbers, as well as a remarkably huge moral blindspot. But in this last he was not alone as he existed in an environment of amoral excess, a time when politics in the city was characterized by widespread Tammany Hall corruption and dominance and when the police chiefs of the period were also numbered among the crime lords, running or sharing in the proceeds of gambling halls and houses of prostitution.<br /><br />Round about 1914, with the murder of one of Rothstein's gambler cronies by a high police official who was notoriously brutal and crooked, the situation changed and reform politics took hold. This drove gambling and prostitution into the shadows though, inevitably, they didn't just disappear. Seeing the handwriting on the wall, the shrewd gambling maven, Rothstein, altered his operations, moving some of his gambling business out to Long Island and bankrolling floating games (which demanded less police collaboration in order to remain in operation) in Manhattan itself.<br /><br />With the advent of World War I, followed by Prohibition, Arnold Rothstein saw new prospects and began backing bootleggers, giving the start to famous gangland kingpins like Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky. Rothstein, however, managed to always keep himself behind the scenes, the go-to guy for police and politician fixing, and for financing new crime ventures. All the while he lived the high life of a gambler (albeit with abstemious eating habits), prone to natty dressing with a penchant for playing the horses. (He even built his own stable of thoroughbreds at one point.) As rum-running began to be phased out, with the impending repeal of Prohibition, Arnold secretly bankrolled the illicit drug industry, again orchestrating the growth of new forms of organized crime.<br /><br />A contemporary of men like Al Capone, Dutch Schultz, Legs Diamond and Owney Madden, Rothstein was a one-man show, rather than a gang leader. But he was the brain and bankroll behind the growth of many of these gangs, a virtual gangland cash cow and master manipulator of others. He's best known, today, for having engineered the fixing of the 1919 World Series, though no one was ever able to definitively link him to the operation at the time. This book does a yeoman's job of laying out the complexities of that story but fails, in the end, to really make the \\"fix\\" crystal clear. In 1928, with his luck on the wane, Rothstein was shot to death by an unknown assailant when he went to a hotel room to discuss a large gambling debt he had incurred.<br /><br />No one ever got nailed for that killing, either, but this book makes an interesting case for what might have happened and why. In the end Rothstein died more or less friendless and estranged from his Catholic ex-wife and his east European Jewish family, having been reluctantly written off by his pious father, known in his community as \\"Abraham the Just.\\" Rothstein seems to have been a man who took the path he did at least in part out of a sense of revolt against his father's piety and religious convictions (and a delight in proving again and again that he was much cleverer than his contemporaries). At the same time, he was always seeking to live up to his father's reputation as a problem solver for others. But Rothstein solved the problems of gangsters, gamblers and crooked politicians, a very different community than the one in which his father, Abraham, had moved.<br /><br />In the end, this book provides a lot of useful information and a powerful picture of early twentieth century New York City. But we don't come away knowing as much about Rothstein as we might like. An enigma to his contemporaries, he seems to have remained that, even to posterity, and this book does not do enough to alter that fact, even now.<br /><br />SWMmight like.

Imagining the court of King Solomon, a somewhat small-minded, self-seeking, albeit reasonably clever, Near Eastern potentate, Stefan Heym here conjures for us a picture of a reluctant scholar sucked into the maelstrom of politics and revisionism by which governing bureaucracies have historically secured their rule. Called to Jerusalem by King Solomon to help glorify the memory of his father, David, and establish the regime's bona fides, Ethan of Ezra, an actual Biblical personage credited with writing one of the psalms, must seek out the varying threads of King David's life from those who have survived him and meld these with the official records and documents of Solomon's court, all with an eye toward creating a legendary king who will give legitimacy to the rule of the petty tyrant, Solomon. Ethan does this at continued risk to his own life and to what is his, driven by an insatiable desire to ferret out and preserve some semblance of truth. All the while, he must find ways to compromise and get away from the court intrigues in one piece. The King David he discovers is not a particularly lovely specimen of humanity and it is Ethan's challenge to preserve a glimpse of this true David, through the smoke and mirrors of the official history he must write. Satiric and ironic by turns, the tale has one real flaw: its characters, though sharply realized, remain aloof from us, people we see but do not greatly care about. However, the book is so well written otherwise, the ancient world of the Bible so brilliantly evoked, that this deficiency does no harm to the book itself. This one is finely wrought as it lays out a convincing tale of how the Bible we have may actually have come to be and of what must really lie beneath the surface of the confused and folklorish tale of David that has come down to us from its ancient authors.<br /><br />SWM  [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]to be and of what must really lie beneath the surface of the confused and folklorish tale of David that has come down to us from its ancient authors.

I was directed to this book by a Wittgenstein aficionado who assured me that Stroll offers a unique and particularly enlightening explication of Wittgenstein's somewhat abstruse thought. Since my familiarity with Wittgenstein was mostly from the sixties, before many of his works saw the light of publication, my informant suggested that I would find a whole new way of seeing Wittgenstein's last work, On Certainty, through Stroll's efforts.<br /><br />Indeed, Stroll's point seems largely to be that, contrary to generally received opinion, Wittgenstein was not a thinker of two distinct periods (characterised by his work in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations) but, rather, three. He claims, in essence, that Wittgenstein's thought was characterized by three great ideas which, he assures us, is three times the amount most great contributors to human thought can lay claim to.<br /><br />I found the book interesting though not entirely clear as to the three distinctly different ideas Stroll asserts will be found, respectively, in the Tractatus, the Investigations and On Certainty. In fact, I did not come away with a clear picture of these at all, though I gather that Stroll is asserting that the Tractatus Wittgenstein is concerned with what can be said and what can't (meaning as significance), while the Investigations Wittgenstein concerns himself with how what we can say controls what we can know (meaning as use vs. the logical atomist view found in the Tractatus which asserted a logical framework for picturing what is), and that the On Certainty Wittgenstein focuses on what can be held to be certain in the various manifestations of the use of that word, \\"certainty.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps it is only my own inadequacy that kept me from grasping the essential difference Stroll sees between the last two Wittgensteins (I actually see On Certainty as very much in the tradition and mindset of the Investigations). But whatever the cause, I did not end up with a clear and convincing picture of the divergences Stroll asserts are there.<br /><br />Nevertheless the book has great value if for no other reason than Stroll's admirable exposition of the Fregean-Russellian logicism that antedated Wittgenstein's own work and formed the ground, in fact, for the young Wittgenstein's philosophical education. I have never found a better presentation of this logically rooted approach of ideal language development which initially influenced the early Wittgenstein and played such a major part in his first and only published (in his lifetime, that is) book of philosophy, the Tractatus.<br /><br />As Stroll notes, Russell's philosophy of logical atomism, a metaphysical precursor to logical positivism which rocked early twentieth century philosophy, seems to have arisen from Russell's exposure to Wittgenstein's thinking while Wittgenstein was his student. Beyond that, logical atomism, per Stroll, took its most definitive form in Wittgenstein's Tractatus.<br /><br />The individual who directed me to Stroll's book, by the way, did so in response to my own criticisms of Wittgenstein since I had asserted that Wittgenstein had failed to make a dent in the area of moral philosophy (though throughout his life he had continued to assert that he was attending to this, even though he seems to have had little explicit to say on the subject). My informant suggested that Stroll's insights concerning On Certainty would put these concerns of mine to rest.<br /><br />What I found instead, though, was very little that was helpful concerning what I take to be the core moral questions. On the other hand Stroll did note two strands in On Certainty concerning what we can speak about with assurance that I hadn't differentiated before. According to Stroll, for Wittgenstein there is that kind of certainty that involves statements which sometimes must be unquestioned, because of the role they play (Wittgenstein's so-called \\"hinge statements\\"), while sometimes the same statements may play a role for us in which it is perfectly acceptable to question them. And then, Stroll tells us, Wittgenstein also holds that there is another kind of certainty (and the statements that express this), that is that sense of assuredness we have of things which is just rooted in our reality (either of the institutional variety or the physical/biological sort).<br /><br />How the two types of statements interrelate and overlap in actual language, however, remains to be explicated more fully though Stroll does suggest that Wittgenstein, in On Certainty, touched on, and had in mind, both types when he laid out his case for disregarding the old philosophical conundrums of how we could be sure of what we know.<br /><br />So the book was useful and enjoyable. But it left a great deal still fuzzy in my thinking. This may, however, be no less due to my own inabilities to grasp certain subtleties as to the failure of the explicator (Stroll) or the original thinker (Wittgenstein) to convey what they wanted to convey. Perhaps at some point I'll give it another read, just to see if I missed more than I should have.<br /><br />SWMich it is perfectly acceptable to question them.

Of particular interest is the parallel with the violence and terrorism perpetrated by the anarchists and wobblies (International Workers of the World) back then, whose anger at the existing capitalist system suffuse and drive this tale, and events in our own time, as we face, once more, an upswelling of terrorism directed against our nation and society.<br /><br /> In the first years of the twentieth century, a well-off family in New Rochelle, New York, which takes its income from the manufacture of fireworks and flags, thriving on the patriotism of the nation, is suddenly thrust into a series of events which will bring its members face to face with some of the less savory characterstics and characters of American society. Famous personages from that era (Houdini, Stanford White, Elizabeth Nesbit, Emma Goldman, J. P. Morgan, Henry Ford) intermingle with the fictional characters and come together in a remarkable confluence as a proud, self-made black musician named Coalhouse Walker comes courting, only to find himself a victim of mindless racism one evening on his way back to New York City. Too proud to walk away or accept less than full restitution for his loss, he at last precipitates a series of events that bring the historical and fictional players together in a shocking moment of violence and careless killing. The characters move on despite the carnage, as America flows forward into the turmoil that will become the twentieth century, but Walker makes his point.<br /><br /> Despite its intriguing sense of period, the tale has some weaknesses. None of the characterizations are particularly strong or moving and the story reads as though Doctorow, having immersed himself in the documents of the period, as part of his research, just decided to write out a description of the real events as he found them, interspersing these with his imagined characters and their doings. Dialogue is buried in the narrative, an interesting technique that does work in this case though it causes the book to read more like an historical narrative than a genuinely dramatized tale of the people at its center. This unfortunately tends to make the characters seem a bit distant and vague. Nevertheless, the tale works and leaves you with a sense of having been there as we laughingly discover how the socialist artist from Eastern Europe, Tateh, finally leaves all his ideals behind to make his fortune in the unique American fantasyland of a newly burgeoning Hollywood. The implied narrative voice of a young boy who views all this from his unique vantage point as a son of a strangely conjoined family is subtly played and almost lost in the final denouement. You have to attend closely to catch it.<br /><br /> Alas, we don't feel much for any of the players except a profound sense of ironic separation as America barrels its way more deeply into the new century, World War I looming darkly on the horizon. And that terrorism which manifested itself at our last entry into a &quot;new century,&quot; and which has been so nicely caught in this novel, seems to have eerily returned once more as we move again into the next hundred year span, prompting me to wonder if Doctorow sensed or imagined any of this back in 1975 when this one was published.<br /><br /> SWMhese with his imagined characters and their doings.

US	51406912	R3NHIMP9AG6MLW	0140447695	341328376	Njal's Saga (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	72	74	N	N	A Northern Iliad	Although most of us have heard of the Greek epics and, in particular, the Iliad and Odyssey (the two most renowned epics in the western world today), we have a great deal less familiarity with the literary tradition of the old Norse folk who inhabited the lands about the Baltic and North Atlantic in early medieval times. We've heard about the vikings, of course, coastal pirates and fighters who sprang from these folk, and about their wide-ranging adventures across dangerous and often unexplored seas. Yet we are not nearly so familiar with the Norse literary tradition which is, in some ways, as compelling and profound as the literature of the ancient Greeks which we so revere today.<br /><br />The Norse saga tradition reflects stories handed down orally for generations which were finally committed to written form in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Among these works, Njal's Saga may well be the best. Like all sagas it is a prose epic (as opposed to the poetic form of the Odyssey and its kind), but with a unique rhythm and perspective which only the Norse folk had to offer. It's a somewhat bleak tale of several generations of Icelandic families whose men and women lived and feuded on the remote island of Iceland, itself only settled by expatriate Norwegian farmers and land holders from about 860 AD onward.<br /><br />Here, in Njal's Saga, is a tale of hard men in a harsh land who push and pull at one another until the only recourse, in their grim pioneering culture, remains the blood-feud. And once unleashed, the blood-flow is literally unstoppable as noble heroes cut one another down until one of the most respected of all the Icelanders, the eponymous protagonist of this tale, is himself burned alive, along with most of his kinsmen, in one of the retaliatory raids which arise from the ongoing feuds. This despite the realization by the burners that what they are about to do will have grim and far reaching consequences. Yet they cannot pull back, for honor's sake, and must suffer the consequences they know they are unleashing by their actions when, at last, a vast well-spring of revenge and justice arises to overwhelm them in the aftermath of their grim deed.<br /><br />In the end it is the wronged viking Kari who single-mindedly pursues and hunts each of the individual burners down, to the far corners of the earth, affording them no peace as he seeks re-payment for the loss of his wife and young son until even he is spent. This, like most sagas, is a tale of many strands and several generations and so it partakes of the literary conventions of its type -- conventions which make it a little harder on the modern reader than some would like. There are extensive character genealogies (of little interest to most of us today) and very limited descriptive text (something else some of us may miss).<br /><br />There is also a decided lack of subjective points of view or of interior monologue. Indeed we never get inside any of the characters' heads and, as in Hemingway at his sharpest, must 'see' the characters for what they are based on what they do and say alone. The entire conceit of the sagas is that they are oral tales, reflecting only what people saw and remembered of the events recounted, and so they are written thus. But at their best, they are a keen, if slightly aged and clouded, lense through which we may observe the doings of real people who are driven, much as we are today, by the same needs for fame and fortune which infect the human soul in every generation. Insofar as these tales, and Njal's Saga in particular, are windows into these matters they are universal in their unraveling of human motivations. And they are great adventure besides.<br /><br />Njal's Saga, especially, has it all including feuds and viking adventure and, in the end, a redeeming sense of human frailty as the need for reconciliation and forgiveness replaces the unyielding cry for justice under the eyes of heaven.<br /><br />If you like the saga form, there are several good tales in this vein, that aim to reproduce the saga in a way that also works as a modern novel. I particularly like ERIC BRIGHTEYES by H. Rider Haggard; STYRBIORN THE STRONG by E. R. Eddison; THE GOLDEN WARRIOR by Hope Muntz (probably the best of the lot); and THE GREENLANDERS by Jane Smiley (a very fine offering as well). I've also done one of my own: THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA; but I will refrain from commenting on it since it is for the reader, not the writer, to judge.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801518 The King of Vinland's Saga]]m, there are several good tales in this vein, that aim to reproduce the saga in a way that also works as a modern novel.

US	51406912	RMOF4C2R5NMMY	0940322064	166402917	The Mystery of Consciousness	Books	4	11	13	N	Y	What is Mind?	A good exposition, via a compilation of past book reviews by John Searle, published over the years in the New York Review of Books, of his views on consciousness and mind, he reiterates here, and in some ways strengthens, his famous Chinese Room argument in examining and denying the claims of the authors of the books under review in this volume.<br /><br />I think that argument, by the way, while superficially right and useful (as a corrective to those with an overly mechanistic view of mind), ultimately misses the point because Searle presents it as a denial of what he calls \\"Strong Artificial Intelligence,\\" the position that holds one can build minds, with the sort of consciousness we have, on computers using programs to accomplish this. Relying on the Chinese Room argument, Searle denies \\"Strong AI\\" by noting that programs are purely formal, or syntactical as he puts it, and that syntax cannot give meaning which requires a knowing, thinking, aware subject.<br /><br />The problem with his argument is that the Chinese Room thought experiment -- while demonstrating that we do expect to see a knower at work in acts of \\"intelligence\\" (and that computers as presented in his thought experiment do not and cannot know anything) -- still does not demonstrate that computers that have been configured and programmed in certain ways cannot produce, at a \\"higher\\" level, just what he wants to deny them, consciousness. That is, syntax may indeed yield semantics in the same way that Searle tells us, elsewhere, that atomic structure can yield hardness or liquidness. But Searle seems never to notice this fundamental flaw in his case.<br /><br />Searle remains fixated on his idea that consciousness is somehow not explainable via syntactical operations, as seen in computers, and this position keeps cropping up in criticisms of the various writers under review in this book. He's particularly hard on Daniel Dennett ([[ASIN:0316180661 Consciousness Explained]]), whom he takes to task for suggesting we are all zombie-like and so, says Searle, seems to be denying the qualitative nature of consciousness which the Chinese Room argument demonstrates. Of course, one can read Dennett's claim as being somewhat polemical since it is hard to take Dennett as saying there is no consciousness in the sense that neither he nor the rest of us have it. Dennett's point seems, rather, to be that consciousness is explainable in terms of non-conscious building blocks and that the sense of being a conscious \\"entity\\" that we get is only that, a sense of this. (However, and this is important, having senses of things, being aware, is not similarly precluded by the absence of entity status. It's just that the entity will be seen as a physical system, not a mental one, since, even though the physical system has awareness of other physical phenomena, which awareness is part of a mental life, there need not be a separate mental entity present, too.)<br /><br />Dennett, in fact, wants to tell us there is no mental entity per se, only various brain functionalities which combine in certain ways to build the subjectness that we experience as consciousness (including consciousness of self). But Searle, taking Dennett literally, accuses him of actually arguing that we are all zombies, i.e., unconcious except that we happen to think we're conscious! Such a reading is, of course, a contradiction in terms as Searle suggests. But this does not seem to be a fair interpretation of Dennett's claims.<br /><br />Searle's Chinese Room argument is right insofar as it shows that the idea of \\"intelligence\\" (what we mean by intelligence in creatures like ourselves) requires a subjective knower. But it is wrong insofar as Searle wants to say that it thereby demonstrates why a claim like the one Dennett makes, that consciousness can be built up on a non-organic machine platform (e.g., computers and their programs), is, itself, wrong. In fact, Dennett's claim looks better and better against the weaknesses of the Chinese Room argument when this argument is applied as an attack against \\"Strong AI\\" as Searle uses it. (That is Searle's Chinese Room Argument suffers from certain technical flaws including a suppressed premise as well as equivocation in some of its middle terms and a failure to elucidate certain key concepts on which the argument depends.)<br /><br />Searle also takes on David Chalmers ([[ASIN:0195117891 The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory (Philosophy of Mind Series)]]) and attacks him for suggesting that consciousness is something that is, in principle, logically divorced from the physicality of the world. As it happens, Chalmers has offered a very useful analysis of the uses we make of mental terms in many cases, showing how we often have two things in mind: a reference to the operational aspects and a reference to the phenomenality that often accompanies the operational aspects, i.e., our experience of having experiences, our subjectness. That we often mean both or one or the other in different contexts seems, in fact, to be quite true. And Chalmers also seems to be right in noting that we often have trouble distinguishing what exactly we are referring to in many actual cases and that the referral function tends to slip and slide over this somewhat icy sheet. Searle rightly suggests that while this may be true of our usages, it doesn't mean that mind and body are two parallel realms as Chalmers seems to be proposing. For Searle this is a matter of how we talk about the phenomena of our experience, i.e., that minds are the functions of brains just as digestion is the function of stomachs, pumping blood the function of hearts, etc. But Searle thinks Chalmers falls into property dualism while he is simultaneously suggesting that consciousness is irreducible. Searle's position is that it is, indeed, irreducible in terms of levels of speech, but scientifically, he wants to say that we can certainly reduce it to a biological function of brains which, as yet, is beyond our understanding but not, perhaps, forever. Searle further suggests that Chalmers holds a position which could, in principle, suppose that consciousness exists throughout the universe at every level, inanimate as well as animate (i.e., a variant of so-called panpsychism). Though Chalmers' rebuttal to this reading is included in the book, Searle does not accept the rebuttal as written and insists the conclusion remains implied in Chalmers' arguments.<br /><br />Searle addresses other writers here as well, including Edelman's work on massively redundant brain processing ([[ASIN:0465007643 Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On The Matter Of The Mind]]) which he finds quite promising, etc. Because of the limitation of this amazon review format, unfortunately, I can't go much further. But suffice it to say, this is a good book and a useful introduction to the ideas of these thinkers. Searle is a good expositor and has some useful points to make, though I think, in the end, he has got some things quite wrong, particularly his claim that his Chinese Room argument puts paid to the notion of \\"Strong AI\\" which, he tells us, holds that minds can be built out of computers and their programs as well as out of brains (the \\"causal\\" source of our own mental lives).

US	51406912	R5J6EC4DMCP4	0674576314	404657468	Searle: Minds Brains & Science (Cloth) (The 1984 Reith lectures)	Books	5	13	14	N	Y	Concise, Clear and Important	Dealing with some of the problems in philosophy that persist, even in our \\"post-modern\\" times, this book by John Searle of the U.C. at Berkely provides a quick, easily read survey of some of the issues about minds, bodies and artificial intelligence that are of special relevance today. Searle is especially keen to restore a commonsense view of things and so his philosophy seems particularly down-to-earth with regard to some of the knottier problems.<br /><br />His notion that consciousness (the stuff of minds) is to brains as digestion is to the stomach (a function of it) and that there are various orders of explanation that can be invoked for the same phenomenon go a long way toward enabling those who are stuck in the mind-body conundrum to get beyond it. In some ways he offers an updating of Wittgenstein who, similarly, offered a way of getting beyond such \\"problems\\" though Wittgenstein reduced it all to a matter of how we talk while Searle wants to say that this only answers the question in part. Unlike Wittgenstein, who dismissed the idea of theoretical explanations superceding ordinary language, Searle wants to reaffirm the importance of such explanations, and to offer a way to develop them. In many ways his proposals make quite a bit of sense.<br /><br />However, I remain struck by his argument against the possibility of what he terms the claims of \\"strong artificial intelligence\\" proponents. He describes this view (page 28) as \\"saying that the mind is to the brain as the program is to the computer hardware\\" and elaborates by noting that \\"on this view, any physical system . . . that had the right program with the right inputs and outputs would have a mind in exactly the same sense that you and I have minds.\\" Thus, \\"strong AI,\\" as he repeatedly terms it, is the view that minds are in no way unique to creatures like us (with organic brains like ours) but are merely the function of the right sort of programs on the right kind of hardware operating in the right sort of way. That is, inorganic machines, like digital computers, can be made to have minds like ours (with the same kinds of features ours have).<br /><br />Searle is very much opposed to this view and in this book brings to bear his most famous argument against it: the Chinese Room thought experiment. In a nutshell it holds that a computer, insofar as it is no different from someone inside a sealed room following purely formal rules in responding to written questions submitted in Chinese (a language he doesn't know) who appears to be responding AS THOUGH HE KNEW CHINESE, so too, can that computer appear to have intelligence, to understand its inputs, without really doing so.<br /><br />His core argument against \\"strong AI\\" is that this is ALL a computer can do, but that simulation in this way is not what we mean by intelligence at all. In fact, he rightly notes, when we think of intelligence, we think of understanding, what he variously calls intentionality and/or meaning (semantic content). But the computer modelled on his Chinese Room evidences no understanding but only a rote process of mechanically producing certain squiggles, according to some pre-established rules that look like they reflect an understanding.<br /><br />The crux of this is a syllogistic argument he also reproduces in this book:<br /><br />1) Brains cause minds.<br />2) Syntax is not sufficient for semantics.<br />3) Computer programs are entirely defined by their formal, or syntactical, structure.<br />4) Minds have mental contents; specifically they have semantic contents.<br /><br />On the basis of the above he offers a number of conclusions but his first is telling: \\"No computer program by itself is sufficient to give a computer a mind. Programs in short are not minds, and they are not sufficient by themselves for having minds.\\"<br /><br />While thinking highly of Searle's work, I believe his Chinese Room argument is deeply flawed. I can't offer a full account here for reasons of space, butthe point is that, while he has correctly noted that the kind of intelligence we have (and that we might be interested in recreating on a computer) is a conscious intelligence, his argument that computers can never offer a medium for recreating this hinges on a mistake. He says in point #2 that \\"Syntax is not sufficient for semantics.\\" He amplifies this by noting that this is \\"a conceptual truth,\\" i.e., it is true by definition. \\"It just articulates our distinction between what is purely formal and what has content,\\" he adds. But the fact that the two notions are conceptually different does not entail a claim that one type of thing cannot give rise to another.<br /><br />Searle wants to say that computers can never provide an adequate platform for the phenomena of consciousness on this basis but his argument doesn't demonstrate this. In fact, despite all his efforts with the Chinese Room thought experiment, one can still envision a complex of computer-driven programs that replicate all the various functionalities we find in our own minds which, if combined in the layered and integrated way they are in humans, can presumably yield the kind of consciousness we have. Of course, this is not to say this CAN be done technically, only that Searle's argument that it can't be founders on the meaning of the term \\"sufficient\\" that he uses in the second step of his argument. He wants us to accept that though step #2 arises from a purely conceptual claim, it can be construed to have an empirical implication. In this I think he errs.<br /><br />All of this said, however, I want to add that this is a very fine book. It is concise, clear, and profound in its thinking. Searle is certainly right in his recognition about what \\"intelligence\\" is, as far as he takes it, which may be about as far as a philosopher can. The rest is up to the scientific workers in the field, those who are experimenting with and designing new ways to operationalize minds in machines.<br /><br />SWMce we have (and that we might be interested in recreating on a computer) is a conscious intelligence, his argument that computers can never offer a medium for recreating this hinges on a mistake.

But this one didn't keep that promise. Well, of course, a batter doesn't get a hit every time he's up and I suppose that is the case even with a skilled writer like Mr. Perez-Reverte.<br />This tale starts with Manuel Coy, merchant seaman and pilot  fallen on hard times, having been banned from the sea for two years, standing and clutching a bloody wound as the narrator introduces him and his story. But the narrator, himself, remains invisible to us until the last quarter of the book . . . and doesn't count for very much, when he finally does appear. In fact he barely plays any role in the tale at all, so it's not entirely clear why Perez-Reverte thought he needed such a distracting device.<br />Worse, the story the narrator is ostensibly telling us contains so many private incidents, which he could not possibly have been privy to, that his role as a recounter of these events strikes one as terminally odd. Either he's a liar or a spinner of fantasies, though when we finally meet him, there is no reason to think he is either. If he had not faded thankfully from view once more at the end, his presence surely would have ruined the entire wrap-up. But, in fact, at the end, our barely visible narrator is nowhere to be seen, gratefully forgotten by the author . . . just as he had been for the bulk of the tale.<br />Still, despite the fact that this story is often very slow going with a great deal of digression and seemingly irrelevant information thrown our way, an overly long slog to find the object of the search, and a singularly dull protagonist (Coy is forever attacking the other side in bloody dust-ups when they get together for various &quot;peaceful&quot; confabs . . . in fact he does it so often you have to wonder how dumb these clever, professional treasure hunters can possibly be, given their persistent failure to anticipate Coy's predictable attacks) . . . despite all of this, I have to say that the story still kept my attention, though I did tend to pick it up and put it down quite a bit more than I usually do when reading a good book.<br />The fact that Coy lusts after Tanger seems to be the only thing driving him and this, combined with his brutal conferencing methods, makes one wonder why she even keeps him around. Even he wonders about this himself, almost incessantly actually, though it doesn't seem to deter him or make him any more aware of his situation. In fact, Tanger's almost complete indifference to him, even after they seem to have hit it off, has to make you wonder just how dumb Coy can be. True, he's portrayed as a simple sailor, uneducated in all but the ways of the sea, but he seems abnormally dull, even for that. Even El Piloto, his old mate, seems to be sharper than he is.<br />The final denouement picks up the story's pace again, though the outcome is not particularly satisfying. It brings us back to Coy clutching at his bloody wound, having shown us how he got to that point . . . but it leaves us with no real sense that anything has really happened besides the landlocked sailor's brief excursion into the mysteries of other human beings which continue, at the end, to confound him. What Coy takes away from it all seems to be little more than the wound in his side, the blood running down his legs, and continued confusion.<br />And yet, despite the sometimes overly detailed facts about sea life, and the novel's faltering about midway though, it recovers at the end as we learn the secret in the story of the &quot;knights and knaves.&quot; I won't tell you what that's about . . . but the book will if you want to try one of Perez-Reverte's less successful efforts. It is readable if you've the patience for it.<br />SWMhis, I have to say that the story still kept my attention, though I did tend to pick it up and put it down quite a bit more than I usually do when reading a good book.<br />The fact that Coy lusts after Tanger seems to be the only thing driving him and this, combined with his brutal conferencing methods, makes one wonder why she even keeps him around.

I don't usually read &quot;bestsellers&quot; but my wife brought this home from the library and as an author myself, though not nearly so successful a one as Dan Brown (author of this book), I was moved to take a look. I started reading it and was swept right up. It was fast paced, polished and intriguing. In fact, I put down another book I was reading to finish this one, so it certainly worked for me at that level.<br />But it didn't work at a deeper level. In the end The Da Vinci Code seemed highly artificial in construction, with characters that were barely more than ciphers inserted in the plot to play their parts but capable of little more. They had no inner life to speak of and nothing about them to make me believe in their lives or experiences.<br />The plot itself hinges on an idea of conspiracies and secret societies that span millenia and involve a hidden history of Christianity. But the notions presented in relation to this are all relatively common place to anyone already familiar with the history of religion and do not suggest any real conspiracy of ancient secrets. I won't say too much here about them, for fear of giving away the story's thrust, which, after all, is its one real virtue. But suffice it to say that the endless puzzles within puzzles, the seemingly arcane expositions when individuals who should have a better handle on facts seemingly don't, the mystery of people who are not what they seem, the idea of hidden beliefs about a &quot;sacred feminine&quot; (whatever that is) that have been long suppressed by institutional religion, and the endless bait and switch tactics of the exposition begin to grate. It got to the point where I knew that, as soon as one thing was revealed to us, it would only prove another way-station in an intellectual treasure hunt that was seemingly premised on all sorts of forced allusions and esoteric interpretations that could not be guessed in advance (a rather unfair trick, it seems to me).<br />About two thirds of the way through, I did guess the identity of the hidden bad guy and after that it was just a matter of waiting to see how the author brought this to the surface. When he finally did, it proved an anti-climax that left me somewhat cold. And the book's final end, itself, which follows the revelation of the hero's antagonist, struck me as particularly forced and a let-down. There wasn't much of a secret there, when all the sound and fury had blown itself out.<br />Still, I have to acknowledge that the book kept me reading and was interesting. Is that enough to warrant bestseller status? Well, perhaps it is, when conjoined with a lot of pseudo-speculation about religion and belief. At the least the book entertained and that, I suppose, is why it sells. Mr. Brown has my admiration for that.<br />SWMthe way through, I did guess the identity of the hidden bad guy and after that it was just a matter of waiting to see how the author brought this to the surface.

Based largely on Thucydides' \\"History of the Pelopennesian War,\\" Pressfield here recounts the life and times of this charismatic and compelling kinsman of Pericles through the recollections of the man who was hired by Sparta to assassinate him. In this \\"as told to\\" narrative, the killer, awaiting trial, tells his story to a man named Jason who he has asked to speak in his defense. Awaiting his day in the courts of Athens, in the same prison where Socrates sits condemned to death, the assassin, Polemides, recalls his own career and the many times it crossed paths with the brilliant Alcibiades.<br /><br />In the course of Polemides' tale we get an in-depth look at the ravages and viscissitudes of war as Athens pursued its struggle against the obdurate Spartans who controlled the Pelopennesian Greek heartland and had never been defeated on the battlefield. Like Alcibiades, the Athenians are bold, clever and energetic as they develop and fight for an overseas empire that makes them richer, and stronger militarily, than their stay-at-home Spartan cousins. Into this mix, after famine and plague have laid Athens low while under siege by the Spartans and their allies, steps Alcibiades. He convinces his mercurial countrymen to fund and support a war against the Greek colony of Syracuse in Sicily to the west, thereby outflanking the Spartans. But just as his campaign is getting off to a brilliant start, Alicbiades' enemies at home cause him to be recalled to face charges of sacrilege. Fearing the worst, he bolts to the Spartans.<br /><br />Without Alicibiades, the Syracusan adventure collapses and the Athenian force is completely routed and destroyed. But Alcibiades soon runs afoul of the Spartans' hospitality, over an indiscretion with their king's wife, and must flee again, this time to Persia. Called home at last by his desperate countrymen, Alcibiades once more takes charge of their war against Sparta, turning the tables on the Pelopennesian city-state in a remarkable series of brilliant military campaigns. But, just as before, Alcibiades' enemies, fearing his growing success and dominance, conspire to undo him. Bringing lawsuits and initiating investigations against him, they prompt the Athenian citizenry to finally turn against Alcibiades by denying him continued funding for the war. After 11 months of continuous victories, Alcibiades sees the handwriting on the wall, realizing that he cannot outlast the Spartans (who are supported by a seemingly endless stream of Persian gold). And so he chucks it all again and quits the field for exile.<br /><br />Replacing him with a committee of generals (to prevent any one of them from becoming too preeminent as Alcibiades did), the Athenians continue their victories (albeit without Alcibiades' consistency and panache) until a freak, storm after one battle, claims the lives of thousands of their countrymen on the high seas. Recalled to face charges of negligence, the generals of the expedition who cannot flee in time are tried, condemned to death and cruelly executed. Bereft of its best leadership and left with only second- and third-stringers who are afraid to make a move for fear of being similarly condemned by the fickle Athenian populace, Athens at last goes down to defeat before the stolid and stubborn Spartans who are led by the scheming and relentless Lysander, a general who may be Alcibiades' only equal on the battlefield . . . and off.<br /><br />Alcibiades in exile dreams of a third comeback but the Spartans are set on preventing that. And so Polemides recalls his final charge, to find and slay the man he served with . . . and under . . . a man he had grown to both love and hate by turns. Alcibiades is building a third army of Thracian tribesmen in the northand it is there that Polemides initially goes to find him.<br /><br />This tale suffers from its complex narrative structure no less than from the complex series of events on which it is hung. Still, despite a slow start, it catches fire and succeeds because of the seriousness and respect with which Pressfield handles it. Reflecting the somewhat formal and distant prose style of the original Greek material on which it's based, it conjures up a period for us that is worth recalling, not least for what it has to say about our own democratic excesses in this early part of the twenty-first century, some 2500 years after the Athenians cut their own throats though envy and political backbiting.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Pressfield thinks this is his best work to date.

A finely written description of how most stories can be fitted into a mythic boilerplate, consistent with the Jungian archetypes made famous by Joseph Campbell in his analysis of mythological motifs and their resonances. As Vogler shows, the frameworks of most stories tend to be somewhat similar and the functional aspects of characters tend to recur from story to story and culture to culture. This is a very useful fact for writers to recognize and an important tool to master in the process of writing. Generally it happens on a gut level and Vogler recognizes and does not diminish this aspect of writing. But he also calls our attention to the forms that stories take and which we must know, at some level, when we write them. Still, though I have been attentive to this myself, I think that too much can be made of it at times. Vogler himself clearly shows how the mythic forms can be stretched to such an extent that, after a while, they seem to be as different as they are similar. When you take them this far, is it really the case that we're all doing the same thing within a universal framework, a la Campbell? Or is it all just a series of sometimes useful generalizations and little more?	2004-02-22

Induced to develop his skills as a tool for his mentor, the kindly if stern Shigeru, young Takeo learns to control his special abilities and to love the samurai Otori clan which has adopted him.<br /><br />But the world is quaking all around him as his deadly enemy, the warlord Iida, closes a trap designed to complete his conquest of the three lands. Only Shigeru and his allies stand in Iida's way, but Iida forces Shigeru to step into a deadly trap. Joined by Takeo, Shigeru advances with eyes open into the jaws of Iida's waiting lion, all the while planning the enemy warlord's undoing. But there are other claims on Takeo, claims which may yank him away from Shigeru at the moment he's most needed.<br /><br />The story was a bit predicable but compelling nonetheless, even when you can guess where the next turn will be. At the same time, the ambience of old Japan felt remarkably right. As Takeo struggles with the need to avenge the slaughter of his own clan (the mysterious group known as the Hidden) by Iida's minions, and the demands on his loyalty from his newly adopted clan (the Otori) vs. his blood ties to the mysterious Tribe (a group of families with special, almost magical skills), he must make a decision to risk all and save Shigeru and the young woman he has come to love or accept the Tribe's apparently unreasonable demands on him.<br /><br />Although the final outcome is never in much doubt, how we get there is. And it's fascinating to watch it all unfold. In the end, this is an action tale set in an exotic world  . . . nothing more.

US	51406912	R3FYW2HAHHA4EF	0399147624	912786438	Gunman's Rhapsody	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Familiar Tale Retold with Manly Panache	I like western movies but have never been big on the novels. Can't say why. Who knows why we like some things but not others? Nevertheless, I've recently become interested in reading western fiction, probably because of the work of Larry McMurtry. (I was bowled over by his Lonesome Dove and liked some of the others in that series, which followed it.) And so I picked up Parker's Gunman's Rhapsody as soon as I saw it.<br /><br />It was not only a western, it was about one of the quintessential western legends: the now mythic feud between the Earp brothers and the Clantons and McClaury's in 1880's Tombstone, Arizona. And so this was more than just a \\"shoot 'em up\\" to me, it was real history, based on actual historical records and the recollections of many of those who were there. (Josie Marcus, Wyatt's paramour, actually wrote . . . or dicated . . . her own record of these events toward the end of her life.)<br /><br />Parker's writing in this novel is tight and sharp. The characters are limned in subtle but clean strokes, through taut description and even tauter dialogue. The Wyatt Earp of this novel is not the goody-two-shoes lawman he's sometimes portrayed as. Indeed, he's not above gunning a man down in cold blood though, as he tells his high-strung buddy, Doc Holliday, after one such event, the difference between Holliday and him is that Doc'll shoot a man over a spilled drink whereas Wyatt, even when stepping outside the law, demands good cause. So, if he's a killer, at least he doesn't kill lightly is what he seems to be saying. And that's enough for the Wyatt of this tale, a man of supreme self assurance, unmoved by the need for approval, appreciation or the good opinion of others that seems to drive lesser men.<br /><br />Parker's tale pretty much captures the story as it has come down to us. If you've seen the movie Tombstone, you already know most of it, although here the \\"evil axis\\" of the cowboys (Curly Bill, Johnny Ringo, Ike Clanton, etc.) is not blown up into some kind of metaphysical thing, as the movie has it. And the basic series of events that unfold reflect less a mythic confrontation between good and evil than they do Wyatt's decision to pursue Josie Marcus and the subsequent anger and humiliation this causes Johnny Behan, Josie's discarded lover. In this novel, Behan is the real force behind the events, a weasel of a man who stirs up trouble from the shadows, while the cowboys seem to have been clumsily caught in the middle. Other differences with the film, Tombstone, include the handling of Doc Holliday who is rather thinly drawn here and does not rise to the dimensions Val Kilmer gave him in the movie. The end's a bit different too, more off-handed than the overblown dramatic scenes of Tombstone, the movie, and, because of this, somewhat less affecting.<br /><br />In fact I wished there had been more dimension to the rather familiar cast of characters, even if they were not the Tombstone personalities so vividly brought to life on the big screen. But on balance I liked this tale and thought it offered a very-down-to-earth look at the events leading up to, and following, the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral.<br /><br />On the other hand, I didn't much like the interpsersed news items which were mainly distracting, not informative . . . and I missed the mythic interplay between Wyatt and Doc, whether THAT ever really was the case or not. (Surely, given the different life trajectories of these two men, and their very different temperaments, there must have been something that cemented their friendship. But we don't get a real sense of that here.) Bat Masterson's appearance, too, seemed gratuitous and rather too fleeting.<br /><br />But, in sum, this was a nicely told tale. I admired Parker's clean prose and his ability to say so much with dialogue. A good western, though not up to a great one like Lonesome Dove.<br /><br />SWMphysical thing, as the movie has it.

The story of one man's immersion in a world of political and personal corruption, this novel follows the efforts of political operative Roscoe Conway to break free from the milieu in which he's spent his adult life: Albany politics. Mixing political shenanigans with Depression-era bootlegging and gangsterism, the story opens shortly after the end of World War II with our eponymous hero seeking a way out. But his buddies, Patsy McCall (the town's Democratic Party boss) and Elisha Fitzgibbon, a local blueblood and businessman, who, together with the shrewd Roscoe, make up the Democratic Party triumvirate that wields power in Albany, demand his continued attention. Patsy asks Roscoe to hang around a while longer and then Elisha goes and  dies under suspect circumstances, sucking Roscoe back into the vortex of political maneuvering and personal feuds that define his world. As the Republican governor tries to get the goods on the Democratic party leaders and young Alex Fitzgibbon, son of Elisha, returns from the war (he'd volunteered to serve as a private in the infantry) to resume his old seat as Albany's mayor, things really heat up. State troopers are snooping around and trying to bust the brothels and gambling establishments secretly operated by the Democratic chieftains even as Roscoe must try to avoid the whiff of scandal occasioned by Elisha's untimely demise. For Roscoe this is doubly hard since Elisha's widow is also Roscoe's first and, apparently, only true love. So while trying to figure out the secret behind Elisha's abrupt &quot;departure&quot; from the world of Albany's living, Roscoe initiates a tentative courtship of the beautiful Veronica, Alex's mother, at the same time. Meanwhile Patsy and his brother Bindy have a falling out over some chickens (they are competitive devotees of cock fighting), which threatens to blow the Albany machine's operations wide open, leaving them prey to the holier-than-thou Republican governor (not mentioned by name but clearly Thomas E. Dewey).<br />We follow Roscoe as he moves about the town meeting various players, trying to tamp down the problems that keep cropping up and to figure an angle that will enable the Democrats to hold onto power in the upcoming election, no matter what. For Roscoe voting fraud, public bluster and misrepresentation are all tools of the trade. And yet Roscoe is an endearing sort, somewhat overweight and clearly overly romantic, he pines for Veronica while he struggles to hold the rapidly unravelling strands of their lives together, even when Roscoe's former wife, Veronica's sister Pamela, returns to try to extort money from her lovely sibling. Could she be the reason Elisha, Veronica's husband and Roscoe's boyhood friend, took the final powder?<br />The novel shows us these events through the somewhat hazy, and possibly less than completely reliable, eyes of the clever but world weary Roscoe as he seeks to retrieve his life in one final chance to do more with it than scheme and manipulate votes in the backrooms of Albany. Enjoyable and sharply written, this book faltered about halfway through but picked up again and carried me through to the end.

But this one nearly attains that goal. Here is a novel of two brothers, separated as babes, the elder a perfect Spartan paragon, the younger deformed at birth and abandoned by his parents to die of exposure in the wild. Rescued by a shepherd of the Helots, that people who were enslaved by the Spartan citizenry, the crippled child is raised and strengthened by his adopted people and taught to become their long dreamed of champion. But the Spartan blood of Talos the Cripple calls to him and draws him inexorably back to his Spartan roots even while the Spartans alternately torment and tolerate him, recognizing him as one of their own. Drawn into the great Battle of Thermopylae, the crucial plot-point of GATES OF FIRE, Manfredi's SPARTAN follows Talos in his struggles against the brutal inhumanities of Sparta and his own return to their ranks . . . and the conspiracies that characterized the ancient Hellenic world of the Greek city-states. The depth and poetry of Talos' personal experiences and the war in his soul carry this tale, though, perhaps, some of the other characterizatations grow pale by comparison. His Helot and Spartan mothers seem ghostly shades, even in life, while his beloved Antinea has but a bit part. The other Spartans are not much stronger and the plot feels a trifle contrived as we follow Talos from slavery to heroism and then to the point where he must choose a path between the two. The tale was compelling and kept me going throughout, but the ending felt just a bit too melodramatic, with one too many loose ends. But, in the end, this was a tale that aimed to spin a modern myth out of ancient Greek cloth, complete with prophecies and mysterious dreams and a sense of fate, and the gods, at work. Not quite a tragedy in the old Greek sense, it's nevertheless finely done for all its faults. If not quite perfect, it's yet a fine rendering of an ancient and, by modern standards, despicable people, though we come to see their humanity even through the harsh and brutal measures that define them.

Driven by the invading Huns from middle Asia, the Germans, who have lived for generations in uneasy relation with their Roman neighbors, decide to push into the Roman province of Gaul to claim new lands and wealth for themselves, as well as to escape the Hunnic pressure. Against them stands an aging Roman general, Maximus, plucked from obscurity on the Wall in Roman Britain, and his lifelong friend, who together must marshal the shrinking resources of a shrinking Roman hegemony as Gaul's citizenry pretends all is well. The first half of the book gives us Maximus on the Wall, living a marginal life as a soldier in a forgotten outpost, marrying and losing his wife along with a close friend, Julian, who becomes involved in an insurrection and is condemned to a life of slavery. Then the Roman general Stilicho (of Germanic descent, himself) arrives and unexpectedly taps Maximus as a soldier he can depend on, to build him a legion. The aging career soldier rises to the occasion and serves with distinction in Stilicho's forces until, at last, he is sent to man a northern frontier post, opposite Germania, with instructions to hold the line against the encroaching Germans at all costs. Faced with the corruption and lack of spirit of the Gaulish townsmen, he must build his force with bits and scraps while employing a host of strategms and trickery to convince the Germanic leaders to avoid confrontation. In the end he fails as the German kings learn his real strength and the book's second half is devoted to his last-ditch efforts to hold them back. This part of the tale is as brooding and compelling as the first half was dry, making the whole thing worth the read. Each agonizing advance of the Germanic host is chronicled as Maximus employs careful planning and deception to save Gaul and his legion as the tribesmen make their inexorable advance. A good tale, albeit a slow-starter and somewhat thin on characterization. But the mood and images of a collapsing Roman world shine brilliantly through, making this one a book worth reading. -- SWMead.

A troubled, if brilliant, man he first became fascinated by the technical philosophical work of Bertrand Russell in his youth while studying to be an engineer in England. After an initially awkward first interview with Russell, the dean of logical analysis became convinced that \\"his German\\" (he was in fact Austrian, as Russell subsequently determined) had the stuff of genius and might well be the answer to his needs. Russell had become convinced that he'd made all the progress he would ever make on the technical side of philosophy and had so exhausted himself that he needed to find and nurture a younger acolyte with the energy to carry on and take \\"the next big step.\\"<br /><br />Russell soon concluded Wittgenstein was his man and became the young Austrian's mentor. Wittgenstein plunged into the work with his usual focus, though he could not bring himself to publish until he had it right, much to Russell's dismay. World War I found Wittgenstein back in his family home in Vienna (where his kin, members of an extremely wealthy industrialist family of German-Jewish descent, though Catholic in upbringing and commitment, were prominent). Volunteering for service in the Austrian army, Wittgenstein found life as a soldier, among average people, intolerable and volunteered for the front to test his mettle. There, he placed himself in harm's way, impressing his superiors and ended up a prisoner of the Italians.<br /><br />During this time he committed his thoughts to a small book which he shared by mail with Russell: the Tractatus-Logico Philosophicus, destined to become a classic though he had a great deal of trouble getting it published initially. After the war and publication of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein left philosophy for a career as a grammar school teacher in a rural part of post-World War I Austria. He seems to have been a good teacher, if overly demanding and given to corporal punishment of his charges, something he came to regret in later life. After one particularly eggregious incident, he fled Austria's school system and returned to Cambridge to do philosophy again.<br /><br />During his period as a grade school teacher, his Tractatus made the rounds of professional philosophers in Cambridge and in Austria (where it fascinated the nascent movement of logical positivists, who sought to establish a philosophical method entirely consistent with science and free of the taint of old philosophy's metaphysics). Though Wittgenstein became something of a guiding light for these \\"Vienna Circle\\" positivists, his concerns were never quite consonant with theirs.<br /><br />Back in Cambridge, he took up his teaching duties again, as assistant instructor and, later, professor of philosophy, but could never bring himself to publish another work, though he worked on many manuscripts and much of what he thought and wrote was circulated in notebook, and other more or less unpublished, forms. During this time he began to question what he had done in the Tractatus, a book he had once thought answered all the questions that could be answered. As he wrestled with his old ideas he gradually came to discard them, much to the chagrin of Russell who could not fathom the odd turn Wittgenstein's thought had taken which seemed to deny everything Russell found important and worth troubling over. The two men grew apart. While admiring Wittgenstein's ability to think deeply and with originality, Russell came to conclude that Wittgenstein's philosophy had gone wrong. More telling, though, is that Russell's own way of doing philosophy, so-called logicism, gradually fell out of favour as young philosophers came under the Wittgensteinian spell.<br /><br />A charismatic if irascible man, the expatriate don continued, after his return to Cambridge, to work through his revolutionary ideas about the nature of logic and knowing itself, and what it really meant to do philosophy. Discarding the old logicist notions he'd held in the Tractatus, he revised his way of understanding the world. If, in the Tractatus, he'd supposed that language somehow mirrored the world and that this could be seen but not explicitly discussed, he now came to hold that language did not so much reflect what was in the world as construct it. His new view suggested that language was more like a tool box than a camera or mirror and that we built our world by applying its tools in their proper places.<br /><br />The way to understand things was to look deeply into the uses of language itself which, in their ordinary form, were more basic and substantial than the logical forms which had been the stuff of Russellian analysis. For the later Wittgenstein, the key was to stop thinking about abstractions and to return, instead, to the concrete. Philosophical problems were largely puzzles or confusions which needed not to be solved, as with scientific problems, but, rather, dissolved. Philosophy became, on his view, a personal search for understanding and not a process of building systems to compete with scientific theorizing. His focus and interests ranged from the foundations of mathematics (he denied the logicist basis Russell had aimed to construct) to the arts and ethical matters (how must a man live?) though he doesn't seem to have contributed anything explicit in this last area.<br /><br />Philosophy became, in his view, the search for insight, for new ways of seeing, and the abandonment of system-building and hollow logical discourse which he thought too divorced from what we really thought and said, as manifested in our daily language and activities. Out of this later Wittgensteinian view arose the linguistic analysis school of philosophy and the ordinary language school, two approaches that saw the way to do philosophy as the unpacking of misused verbiage which occurs when we are led astray by superficial appearances in language. The key was to look at language as it is actually used and realize that what is meant is often quite different from what we take a word, phrase, or claim to mean.<br /><br />A man of religious fervour and orientation, Wittgenstein never seemed able to accept the Catholic doctrines of his youth though he was drawn inexorably towards them. His apparently homosexual orientation complicated matters and prompted a sense of self-loathing that seems to have haunted him to his final days. In this fine biography, the man's course is carefully traced from childhood to his deathbed, writing philosophy to the last, despite his famous advice to his students to avoid the field and his belief that the best way to do philosophy was to achieve the state of understanding which enabled you to simply stop worrying about so-called philosophical problems and just walk away.<br /><br />SWMnt to do philosophy.

Although author Liss seems to have the history right (his facts &quot;feel&quot; true) and his writing is competent and entirely workmanlike, there is a heavy-handedness about it all. The characters are rather ordinary and seem to lack life while the narrative is overly talky (emulating real eighteenth century prose?) and tells more than shows what is going on. I think Liss walked a fine line between evoking the &quot;voice&quot; of older times and saying too much and sometimes he seems to slip over the edge. I found the main character, Benjamin Weaver, a sephardic Jew in England whose family hails from Iberia via Holland, somewhat tiresome and rather too dull to make much of a detective and his Watson-like sidekick, Elias Gordon, a dissolute Scottish surgeon and rake with Shakespearean aspirations, overly flat. The mystery plods on for the first half of the tale, overwhelmed by a slow and cumbersome exposition, so that the main impetus to read on must come from an interest in the South Sea stock bubble itself and how it heralded a changed world of finance that is still with us today. Indeed, the background to this tale, the development of capital financing through stock markets and paper manipulations, is fascinating stuff in its own right. About half way through the book though, something happens and the mystery begins to compel. While the Jewish background often seems a bit forced (Weaver's uncle seems too perfect, the gratuitous peddler too eastern European for the period) and the array of characters (both Jewish and British) too caricatured, the pace of the tale finally does pick up as the inevitable unravelling of the situation takes on a life of its own. As Ben Weaver stumbles his way through events, and he rarely seems perspicuous enough to stand up to the behind-the-scenes players who may be manipulating him, he finally begins to break through the veil of confusion and obfuscation when he lurches into fighting mode. Still, the resolution, while satisfying when it comes in that it is somewhat of a surprise (at least I found it such), does not have the kind of emotional resonance that really appeals, the result of the flattish characters with whom we have been engaged. As a mystery this novel proves out and as an historical piece it is factually rich and fleshed out. But as a novel it was a bit too heavy-handed for my tastes. Still, it was readable and worth the time for anyone interested in this period or in the historical mystery genre.

Nicely written, to be sure, but this book never caught fire for me, perhaps because of its decidedly unsympathetic protagonist, the Roman emperor of Byzantium, Justinian II (Rhinometus -- for the \\"nose-cut\\"). Mutilated by having his nose slit or cut in some unspecified fashion by his enemies when he was overthrown after a stint as emperor of the Bysantines, this self-absorbed, albeit reasonably intelligent, tyrant managed an almost unheard of second shot at the Imperial throne -- only to cast that away as well by inspiring his subjects to a second revolt because of his excesses and unremitting cruelty. Certainly a tough character to render sympathetically. And that, I think, is what ultimately did in an otherwise well written novel. Although the prose is sharp and the voice mostly \\"true,\\" the book still doesn't really get off the ground. Turtletaub did not attempt to create a novel solely from the perspective of the period, as Robert Graves did with his Count Belisarius, but rather to evoke a \\"modern\\" voice which might have been, had the writing and speaking conventions of the times matched our own vernacular. But even this nicely managed artifice (and he does pull it off) cannot save a tale which revolves entirely around so unpleasant and thick-headed a fellow as this Justinian seems to have been. How can one want to read more about a fellow who savagely butchers those soldiers who remained by his side, during an unssuccessful battle, because most of their fellows went over to the enemy and thereby lost the day for him? Not something likely to inspire loyalty in one's followers nor sympathy in the audience reading about this exploit! Or the fellow who, returning to his throne, butchers the lackeys and hangers-on who accepted and served the men who overthrew him as they now accept and serve him! A man who spurns his own daughter because her mother died giving birth to her! A man who inflicts the most hideous tortures on those who overthrew him and who revels, with his wife, in this exercise of revenge and then goes off to bed with her for a pleasant night of love-making. Granted these are not unknown types in the world, but they are not the stuff of engaging tales or sympathy either. Justinian's affection for his barbarian bride and his grudging deference to his mother, or his hard times as a mutilated exile in the northern Byzantine trading town of Cherson, are hardly enough to make him a sufficiently engaging or sympathetic character to sustain this rather weary tale. Certainly it reflects an interesting historical time and place as well as a well-done effort to novelize such intriguing events. But it just doesn't cut it, no pun or fun with Justinian's lost nose intended. And I, for one, would have liked to see more of these Khazars, who are among the most enigmatic mysteries of this period in history. Certainly they played a mighty big role in Justinian's activities. And, apparently, went on to play an even bigger one in subsequent events. (See D. M.

Not a &quot;work of philosophy&quot; but, rather, a compilation of his more personal and/or less philosophical personal jottings from 1914 to the end of his life in 1951, this little book is worth taking up if you are fascinated by Wittgenstein and his thought. However, it will disappoint anyone coming to it for a detailed analysis of many of those issues (religion, art, morality) that his major works do not delve into more extensively. All we are offered here is an uneven scattering of personal remarks and truncated observations over the course of one very significant philosopher's life. Sometimes the remarks are extremely enlightening. More often they are too cryptic or personal or vague to offer much insight into the man and his ideas. Moreover, there are some musings here that are decidedly personal, making me uncomfortable just to be reading them. Peter Winch, who did the compilation, notes he excluded anything of too personal a nature but, given what got through, I can only conclude that the other stuff must have been doozies. Here we see Wittgenstein castigating himself as a sinner, unworthy to be saved, as he struggles to understand and re-subscribe to the Catholicism of his youth. While such information is of great interest to those of us who have been deeply affected by his philosophical work, throwing light on the driving forces which affected his thought, I was left feeling profoundly uncomfortable, reading things I suspect he never would have wanted to see the light of day. In the end, this book offered me more of a view into the man, Wittgenstein, than into his ideas about cultural issues . . . the reason I'd come to the book in the first place. And Wittgenstein seems a smaller man, and his ideas somewhat less substantial to me, for having read this book. Still, I'm not sorry I did. Better to understand a man than be awed by a giant. -- SWM	2003-04-28
US	51406912	R2JR64RN0J1Q7R	0061316865	900157080	On Certainty (English and German Edition)	Books	4	132	137	N	N	A Very Useful Little Book from a Very Substantial Philosopher	A compilation of loosely connected, aphoristic-like statements about the idea of certainty, taking off from G. E. Moore's famous assertion in favour of common sense, Wittgenstein here presents his thoughts, at the end of his life, concerning the question of how sure of anything we can ever be. Dealing with a fundamentally epistemological question, this little book follows the path Wittgenstein had defined for himself in the latter part of his career, concerning itself with language and how we talk about the ideas we have.<br /><br />Some misread him very badly, which is not surprising given his penchant for cryptic brevity and his own tendency to avoid extensive explication of his ideas in favour of the brief observation or statement reflecting moments of insight. Indeed, insight seems to have been at the very core of his later philosophy . . . it's all about seeing things in a new way.<br /><br />On the matter of certainty, his claims here, sometimes rambling and seemingly unconnected, seem to boil down to a couple of points, consistent with his general way of seeing things:<br /><br />1) Being certain of anything, he seems to say, is a matter of what we mean in the context in which we are expressing certainty. That is, he suggests that \\"certainty\\" the word has different meanings, depending on the application, and that we can become too readily confused if we try to apply one meaning (or use) in a place where another is required. As a corollary of this, he clearly holds that there is no basic idea of \\"certainty\\" to which all can be reduced, but only a range of related uses of the word in our language. This is in keeping with his larger view of the world as \\"contained\\" in our knowledge of it, and our knowledge \\"contained\\" in the words we use which are, themselves, a function of our language, which last is a part of our behavioural continuum, representing a rule-governed activity in which we are embedded as what he called a \\"form of life\\". (There are significant metaphysical implications for this but he does not touch on these, either in this book or more generally elsewhere, since he felt that to do that was often to stray out of the bounds that language made for us.)<br /><br />2) As an outgrowth of the above, his second insight here tells us that there are some things of which we can be certain in a way that does not require what we would normally expect, i.e., evidence or proof. That is, sometimes a statement is just grounded in the rules of the game itself, i.e., in order to play in the game we must just assert the certainty . . . and believe in it. While such assertions may look the same as assertions of empirical certainty (\\"there is a bird outside my window\\") they are not (e.g., \\"there is an external world,\\" \\"there are other minds inside other human bodies,\\" etc.). To doubt certain things like this would be to break the rules of the game in which we are operating, in which case everything else collapses and we can no longer play.<br /><br />In keeping with his usual approach, Wittgenstein does not present an argument for any of this or even make these claims, quite as explicitly as I have just done, in this book but, rather, confines himself to musings and observations, examples and questions. But it is to these two main points that everything he is presenting in On Certainty leads.<br /><br />A note: some seem to have concluded from Wittgenstein's penchant for aphorisms and indirection that he was saying things quite different than he really was saying. I note someone here who accuses Wittgenstein of solipsism and this is a woeful misreading of him. His philosophical approach, in fact, put paid to the solipsist argument if read aright! Others have thought he was just playing with words or posturing as some kind of faux mystic. I would suggest that such ideas are false but that they arise because he was so unwilling to explicate his thoughts in the usual discursive way and, perhaps because he thought to do that would just lead one in circles.<br /><br />So when reading Wittgenstein, you have to do it as he thought it and join him in the gnawing of the intellectual bones he displays in his observations. It is a matter of our seeing his point and not of his establishing logically defensible claims and arguments which we can debate with him or ourselves.<br /><br />Someone else here likened him to a Zen master and I would suggest that that is very apt, indeed. Although his philosophical interests were mainly epistemological and not \\"spiritual\\" (defined as trying to place the conscious self in relation to the world in which it finds itself a la Zen), his techniques were not much different from those of Zen and his outcomes, insights into what we really mean when we say things, were on a par with the Zen idea of achieving satori (the moment of enlightenment). Different focal points, indeed, but the same strategy and the same basic understanding of the way introspective knowledge is secured for both.<br /><br />Still, this particular work is very incomplete, perhaps because he wrote it while ill and apparently died before he could \\"complete\\" it . . . . leaving us a very limited look at a very significant epistemological problem with a somewhat spotty analysis and \\"solution.\\" The Philosophical Investigations, his last (and also incomplete) work written specifically for publication, has much more to offer on his overall view of things and relative to the basic insights he invokes here in understanding \\"certainty\\".<br /><br />SWM<br /><br />P.S. For anyone interested, I have (hopefully) started a discussion re: On Certainty which (as of now, at any rate) can be found further down on this amazon page.

An intriguing tale out of Greek legend, the kick-off of the Trojan War in which Agammenon, High King of the Achaian host, must overcome inauspicious, contrary winds to launch his fleet of brigands and cutthroats . . . or lose the opportunity for war and loot. Importing a somewhat modern sensiblity into the ancient tale of Iphigeneia at Aulis, Unsworth nevertheless blends the modern and ancient skeins remarkably well. Calchas, the reluctant and overly intellectual seer struggles with himself to defeat the manipulations of an always wily (and somewhat sadistic) Odysseus who would oblige the foolish and egoistic Agamamenon to sacrifice his favourite daughter to the chief god of the Greeks. But Calchas is not up to the challenge and finds himself sinking more and more deeply into the morass of intellectual and moral quicksand that Odysseus has created.<br />The book bogs down when it shifts to Iphigeneia herself, in Mycenae, as we seem to lose the narrative momentum, but it picks up again with the summons from Aulis where the fleet is beached. Although the tale's end is predictable, even as Unsworth works to create suspense right up to the end, and the characters never fully come to life, the story is nicely told and resonates with our modern idea of politics and war and the justifications that often make the two overly comfortable bedfellows.<br />Iphigeneia, herself, is rather wooden and Sysipyla, her slave girl and erstwhile saviour, is not much more vivid. Macris, too, the young soldier who has his eye on Iphigeneia, also fails to ignite as a character. The best, the clearest of the characters is, remarkably, Odysseus himself, despite certain tiresome locutions. He is a complex creature, cruel and smart, though ultimately a man of little fundamental depth. He cleverly plays the awkward king and manipulates Chasimenos, the king's chief advisor, along with Calchas the seer . . . a man who finds his courage too late to change history.<br />The two Ajaxes are the ridiculous buffoons we find in the Iliad itself, just as you'd imagine them in more modern voice. And Achilles, of course, is dynamically narcissistic. The Singer is, well, the Singer, a proxy for Homer and all the Homers that were to come.<br />In the end it is the dynamic of bureaucracy and political expediency, combined with the all too human human penchant for rationalization, that foreclose the options and ensure the denouement that Odysseus has schemed for since the idea of the sacrifice first entered his head. Sysipyla alone sees though him and works to undo the awful sentence. But can she?<br />This book was most satisfying, as much for the modern spin it put on an ancient tale, as for the richness of the Achaian world it evoked, even via a semi-modern voice. But the story itself was rather stilted and the characters not entirely compelling. Still, it is certainly worth reading if you like historical fiction with a contemporary slant on things and especially if you are fascinated by tales of the ancient Greeks.<br />SWMlous buffoons we find in the Iliad itself, just as you'd imagine them in more modern voice.

Devoted to his arcane medieval art of swordsmanship, in an age of pistols and crass commerce, he lives in a museum-like apartment, sustaining himself by teaching fencing to a few less-than-promising students, the sons of the lesser nobility. Himself a commoner, he is the picture of the faded gentleman, a man more suited to the nobility than many of those who are his social superiors and to whom he must defer.<br /><br />Without family or real friends (excluding a few local cafe acquaintances with whom he has little in common save loneliness and a sense of marginalization), the fencing master observes his own slow physical decline and is acutely aware that his best years are behind him . . . his future but one thing: the inevitable loss of bodily strength and skill with the blade (which, alone, sustains him materially and spiritually). At the end of his lonely trail lies a sojourn in a hostel for the aged, attended by the nuns, until he breathes his last.<br /><br />Forseeing his own inevitable decline, he is no less aware that the art he espouses, no longer esteemed in the society in which he lives, will fade, like him, to a shadow of its former self, the more so as men of his ilk pass inexorably from the scene. And so, the old \\"maestro\\" devotes himself, in these fading days, to a book he is composing, a master work on the art he loves, and to developing the one thing that will, in his estimation, leave a real mark and make that work worthwhile, setting it apart from hundreds of other fencing treatises: the description of his hoped for grail, the \\"unstoppable thrust\\". But this, the ultimate fencing technique he longs to discover and document, eludes him, as it has throughout the preceding 30 years of his life.<br /><br />One day, as he struggles with his few students and his manuscript, a mysterious young woman, new to Madrid, summmons him to her apartments and presents an unorthodox request . . . that the maestro take her on as his student. Astonished and confused, as much by the alluring charm of his petitioner as by the inappropriateness of her request in a still conservative Spain, the maestro wavers . . . drawn to a youthful and mysterious beauty that awakens in him old dreams and remembrances. And yet he bridles at this proposed violation of those venerable traditions that are the one consoling constant in his life.<br /><br />But the lady isn't quite what she seems and her purpose in soliciting the special lessons is hidden from him because of the confusion her raven black hair, smooth skin and brightly blue eyes stir in his heart. And so he is charmed enough to entertain the idea . . . a step that will have seismic repercussions on the small and carefully ordered world of his life.<br /><br />This tale, of a noble soul on the edge of that abyss which awaits us all, is moving and perceptive. As the old maestro succumbs to a brief revival of his youthful spirit, he is sucked into a vortex of intrigue and murder and will face what will prove to be the most dangerous duel of his professional life. In this he loses and finds himself again.<br /><br />Although the second half of the book bogged down a bit with the details of a somewhat cryptic correspondence, the power of the book's insight into a man's final and most deadly challenge more than offset this apparent loss of dramatic focus.

US	51406912	R2I7R1T7U6Q6ZH	0520018370	308043866	Wittgenstein's Conception of Philosophy	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Excellent Addition to the Field	I bought this 30 years ago and never got round to reading it . . . until a couple of weeks ago when I began to become interested in Wittgenstein's work again! Fann offers a very perceptive and articulate reading of Wittgenstein here, covering his early philosophy, as seen in the Tractatus, through to the Philosophical Investigations, the man's last work that he actually intended for publication, though he never quite completed it (and so it had to be published posthumously).<br />Many have been stymied and confused by the oddity of this philosopher, a man who produced so influential a work in his early years (the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus) and then, throwing it all over and seemingly starting again, went on to offer an even more influential work (the Investigations). In the early part of the twentieth century, Wittgenstein was the patron saint of the logical positivists, who formed the Vienna Circle, and the inspiration for the later linguistic analysts and ordinary language philosophers who came after and replaced the verificationists from Vienna. Moreover he has spawned many latter day Wittgensteinians who religiously invoke the somewhat abstruse ideas of his later work.<br />Fann manages to show, in clear and simple terms, how his two great works connect and how Wittgenstein's thinking changed and why. In the process he makes the case for a more poetical, almost metaphysical, reading of the man's later philosophy and shows how Wittgenstein's work revolved around an idea of philosophy that, while advocating the shattering of intellectual confusions that manifested as puzzles, was still more than that.<br />Contrary to a superficial reading of some of Wittgenstein's later, almost polemical, claims about how philosophical problems aren't really problems at all, Fann shows that Wittgenstein may not have meant this as simplistically as it often sounds. Indeed, the man himself did philosophy until the day he died and so it is not unreasonable to assume that he thought he was doing more than working through mere puzzles. The idea of the puzzle, like his ideas of \\"language games,\\" \\"forms of life\\" and \\"grammar,\\" was a good deal deeper and more important than the simple words he used often seem to suggest.<br />Indeed, I was sorry I left Fann's book unread for 30 years since his insights into Wittgenstein and his philosophy are among the most edifying I've found. Wittgenstein's place as a metaphysician, albeit a new kind, is sketched out here. If you are interested in Wittgenstein and you want to get a better handle on the man's extremely subtle and profound thought, Fann's book is an excellent place to start.<br />SWMought he was doing more than working through mere puzzles.

In this one, Marlowe seems to have gotten a lot smarter than he was in FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, a novel in which he was so drunk most of the time that you had to wonder how he managed to survive, let alone adequately \\"investigate\\" anything. But in THE HIGH WINDOW, Marlowe is on the ball. He takes a job for a wealthy, twice-widowed matron, to track down her missing daughter-in-law who, the matron believes, absconded with a precious gold coin from her deceased second husband's collection. The widow's son, abandoned husband of the missing woman, is in the dark and wants to know what gives. He chases Marlowe, as does another detective who is apparently on another, related case. Marlowe out-slicks these guys, along with a semi-tough actor-turned-gangster and his menacing bodyguard, managing to figure out what it's all about, with the murders piling up and the cops breathing down his neck. He even uncovers a murder he wasn't supposed to and proves his good-heartedness in the process by straightening out a very unhealthy family situation. Although he continues to down his liquor as he pushes through the mires of this case, it feels more like social drinking this time, rather than the obsessively self-destructive bingeing seen in the earlier novel. In fact, though Marlowe's employer may be dissatisfied with the result of the investigation she has initiated in a moment of pique, we are not, for he solves the crime he was called in for and sets things that have been very much askew to rights in a most un-Marlowe like manner, leaving matters better than he found them, despite three murders and a darkly tangled familial history. -- SWM	2003-01-05

Moose Malloy is bigger then nearly everyone else and not overly bright but he is dead set on finding his Velma, last seen eight years before when Moose got turned into the cops for a bank job he pulled with some others. Marlowe witnesses Moose in action, while on a case, and gets sucked into the search for the big guy and his long lost honey by one cop while being warned off by another. But Marlowe is too bull-headed to do anything but keep pushing and, surprisingly, not particularly bright, since he keeps getting suckered and hit over the head and put at serious risk of his life. Situations he ought to see coming, as an experienced detective, he seems to persistently misread, perhaps because his liking for liquor has blurred his senses or maybe he just isn't a very good investigator. But, whatever the case, he stumbles on, from one life threatening situation to another. He also can't seem to get his arms around the fuzzy set of coincidences that follow hard on the heels of his run-in with Moose as he gets a job offer that anyone in his business with half a brain would walk away from . . . and then mishandles it badly. The seedy atmosphere of L.A. is very nicely handled and the characters sharply limned and convincing, but the perpetually soused Marlowe, with the self-defeating wise-cracks and nasty mouth is a little tiresome. I had a bit of trouble acclimating myself to the racist mindset that Marlowe and his cohorts present in this 40's milieu, too, since I thought it was somewhat gratuitous and even mean-spirited, but maybe that's how some folks thought in those days. More troubling was my profound sense that Marlowe was just not bright enough, or slick enough, to be a half-decent private eye. He seems, in this book, to have a death-wish, a bad trait for someone who hires himself out as bodyguard and investigator. He takes chances a green kid shouldn't take and never seems to see the blackjack coming. Still, he manages to stumble along, thanks to a combination of apparently undeserved good luck and just plain hard-headedness, until the cause of all his troubles unfolds itself before his and our eyes. Surprisingly, given his drink-induced obtuseness, he solves the mysterious set of coincidences that have led to so much murder and betrayal, and gets the girl who wants him though he's too tough to ever openly acknowledge wanting her. This was a very odd detective tale, if ever there was one, and yet, for all its irritations and flaws it kept me reading to a most satisfying conclusion that pretty much wraps the central problem up in an almost too-tight, neatly tied bow. Moose finds what he was looking for and Marlowe figures out how to find Moose and the killer of Marlowe's mysterious client is unmasked. Marlowe, of course, has another drink. -- SWMwe was just not bright enough, or slick enough, to be a half-decent private eye.

This is a hard tale of a hard guy, a nameless private detective, who arrives in the western mining town of Personville (called &quot;Poisonville&quot; by many of its criminal denizens who hail from points east) to meet a client . . . only to learn that the client has been murdered on the very night of their scheduled meeting. The client was the son of the town's wealthiest citizen, an aging tycoon who, to beat back the unionization of the miners he employs, has invited all manner of gangsters and hard cases into town to break the unions.<br />But, in breaking them for him, the gangsters have moved in for good and taken over running things, setting up their own rackets, controlling the police and sucking the old man into their schemes since they have so much &quot;on him.&quot; The detective (known only as the Continental operative throughout) approaches the tycoon about the murder of his son and soon conceives the notion of cleaning the place up, whether the old man wants him to or not. Playing the various sides off against one another, the detective embarks on a cold-hearted, calculated odyssey to win the confidence of one gangster after another, in order to turn each against the other (shades of Yojimbo!).<br />In the process, the detective, himself, gets drawn into the bloody maelstrom he has created through his various betrayals until, sinking into the same moral morass as all the others, he finds himself waist deep in murder with only the shakiest of alibis and a profound sense of his own moral surrender. The body count mounts as one gangster after another is betrayed by our apparently amoral &quot;Continental op&quot;, until the very pegs on which the town has been hung are shaken loose.<br />The real mystery here is less who killed the detective's original client than who killed the detective's own victim . . . and how will he manage to extricate himself from the violent and bloody depths he has plunged the town of Poisonville, and himself, into. Lots of blackmail and mayhem and bloodshed here and a real sense of lost moral bearings. This detective, for all his good intentions seems no better, in many ways, than the criminal element he has set out to undermine.<br />In the end he does pull himself out of the fire and manages to see the job through, but we are left with a clear sense of amorality that makes this nameless detective little better than the crooks he has overthrown.

Throughout the tale I couldn't shake the voices of Bogart and Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet . . . or the images of them elaborately dancing around one another, in search of the mysterious statuette. Although the book had more detail and events than the film (including allusions to homosexuality and some outright lovemaking between Sam Spade and the mysterious woman from Hong Kong), the screenplay did catch quite a bit of this noirish quest so that the book seemed almost a shadow of the movie in the end. Indeed, Bogart and company made this tale decidedly their own.<br />I suppose this is as much a credit to Hammett and his creation as it was to the director, actors and writers of the film it inspired. But too much of this book depended for me on not knowing what was going to happen. But, of course, I did. Some of the dark resonance was lost too, by this fact, while the characters came across as mere caricatures of themselves (which, of course, they weren't since they preceded the film's cast). Nor did Spade's sharp retorts, high-handed attitude with women, cops and crooks, and his generally cold (not cool) disposition seem to me to mask a deeper and more sensitive soul, despite his final &quot;noble&quot; speech to Brigid O'Shaughnessy.<br />It is certainly not entirely the fault of the book that its impact has been dissipated by the existence of a film which so fully captures it, but it does suggest that the book lacks something at its core since so much of it depends on knowing (or not knowing!) what is happening rather than on seeing it all a-fresh in the mind's eye through the medium of the printed word. That the characters lacked any real depth (their development being fully realized in the movement of the plot alone), worked decidely against the magic of the book. And, regrettably, the long-anticipated denouement with the falcon proved, in the final analysis, to be insufficient to redeem the complex plot and its mysterious machinations. And yet, withal, the book was tight and quick and kept me reading  . . . though it lacked the richness of character I detected in The Glass Key which was, I think, Hammett's better piece by far.<br />SWMot and its mysterious machinations.

Oddly laconic with some rather awkward turns of phrase (he did it \\"difficultly\\"?!!), the writing, nevertheless, is nearly airtight and so sharply laid down that it carries and sets the mood beautifully in this strange tale of a political boss and his gambler buddy who are bent on winning their particular games of life. Paul Madvig, the boss, wants to win the upcoming elections and ensure continuation of his candidates in office while Ned Beaumont, the lone-wolf gambler, wants to get back on a winning streak, collect on a bad debt and protect his apparently dense friend Madvig who has stumbled into a situation. Madvig is in love with a senator's daughter and keen to win her hand and so has allowed his usual good judgement to become clouded. In shifting his political support to the senator, he has lost touch with his own less-than-respectable base, allowing a local gangster to muscle in on his territory. Intent on pushing the gangster back, he makes a dumb play and is soon sucked into a problem surrounding the unsolved murder of the senator's son. Who did it and why are the questions that lie at the core of Madvig's problems and only Beaumont is clever enough, and cares enough, to get to the bottom of it. Along the way Beaumont takes a bloody beating, participates in a murder and loses what he cares most for in all the world. Although the tale takes a while to get revved up and some of the transitions are so abrupt as to be jarring, this was not only a great \\"detective\\" story but one with real resonance that goes well beyond the genre in which it has been cast.

Though I'm not much of a detective fiction fan, I was drawn to try this one because I'd heard the names of Raymond Chandler, and Philip Marlowe, his creation, since I was a boy. A short, moody and convoluted tale of a tough-guy detective with a brain and real moxie, this one lives up to its hard boiled reputation.<br />Marlowe shows up at the Sternwood estate to undertake a quickie investigation into an apparent blackmail attempt (and, hopefully, to suppress the matter) at the behest of a dying old man who is clinging to life even as he angles to protect the two miscreant daughters of his twilight years. Both daughters are wild and careless of others, and prone to fall in with bad company . . . and to do even worse things. But Marlowe soon learns that the trail to the putative blackmailer he must follow leads inevitably from murder to murder, while the one person who means the most to old man Sternwood still hovers, missing, in the background. What happened to ex-bootlegger Rusty Regan and why did he take a powder when he had everything going for him including the beautiful elder daughter, and all the money she stood to inherit, of General Sternwood?<br />As Marlowe follows one trail into another, the deaths get messier, the cops get angrier and Marlowe approaches his own brush with mortality at the hands of a deadly gangland enforcer. The dark and decadent ambience of mid-twentieth century L.A. hangs like a sullen rain cloud over this entire tale as Marlowe fumbles about, trying to figure the real mystery behind the series of apparently coincidental killings he is faced with until, in the end, he  confronts the big sleep that awaits us all.<br />This tale seemed rambling and almost accidental in its construction, just like real life, albeit with a tad more style. And it kept me hooked and satisfied, like a good drag on a newly lit cigarette in a noirish Bogart flick, right through to the end. I'm ready for another.<br />SWM	2002-11-21

But, as I hit the half-way point, the book picked up and I finally began to become absorbed in the tale and its characters. While initially just interesting constructs, the team of investigators finally began to live and breathe for me as they started to close in on their murderer and the puzzle began to seem solvable. There was, indeed, something hokey about the characterizations, as another reviewer has noted here. Roosevelt, for instance was a bit too caricatured (but what else is new?) and the local gangster leader and the role he plays rather unbelievable, while the assembled team of investigators were somewhat mechanical in their parts. But the setting, which seemed at first to be just too much lifeless detail to convince, did finally start to work its magic on me (perhaps it was the general accumulation of all that detail which I had found so annoying at the start). Although the reasons for the disinterest of the New York police in the murders at the outset, due to social stigma, etc., did seem a bit shaky, and the ending was a bit contrived, I read through the second half of the book quite eagerly which certainly indicates that Mr. Carr had me precisely where he wanted me! In sum this book managed to build up a head of old fashioned steam, leaving me with a vivid impression of old New York while keeping me guessing till the end. And that's what any good mystery is supposed to be about, isn't it? -- SWM	2002-11-17

The \\"voice\\" is right, never once slipping into anachronistic modernisms and supplying a truly \\"transparent\\" medium, easily accessible to moderns, which yet conveys the immediacy of historical time and place. The tale is not plotted in any formal sense but proceeds in flashback, a hackneyed but effective mechanism here, as we see the story unfold, both on the level of a life remembered by a fallen Spartan warrior and through the eyes of the Persian court in the midst of their final Greek campaign. The battle scenes are redolent with all the misery and gore of real warfare, too, yet reverberate with the mystery of transcendence -- the real stuff of living and, of course, dying. There is both an earthiness and a metaphysical element to this finely told tale of heroism in the face of overwhelming odds in a place and time which changed the flow of history as we know it. The characters, too, are as real to us as the flesh and blood we see burning and wallowing in death upon the fields of Thermopylae. And we care about them, which, in the end, is what a book like this must be about. I did note that, while the final denouement resonates powerfully long after the last drop of blood has been spilled, the characters themselves did seem to fade a bit and some of the derring-do seemed a bit outlandish to be believed, even in the throes of the adrenalin-driven combat Pressfield describes.

But it was soon eclipsed in my mind by Joyce's works. And Hemingway's. Against the works of these latter authors, Fitzgerald's GATSBY seemed to me to be rather ordinary, old fashioned if you will . . . albeit a nicely honed piece of prose.<br />There is, indeed, a certain artifice to the Gatsby story which smacks of the writer's intentions, an intrusive \\"plottiness\\" reflecting coincidences which are not at all the way things really work in life. And yet for all that, the story is strongly told, moving and lyrical, and the characterizations, as I found on re-reading the novel at my wife's urging, far more subtle than I recalled from my high school days. GATSBY is the story of a mystery man who dreams of a wealthy debutante he met years before, when he was an impoverished young soldier, and whose entire life since has been dedicated to winning her. To do this he has earned millions of dollars in the heyday of racketeering and prohibition (how is never quite made clear) and, at the time the novel is set, is engaged in creating an upper class persona for himself, in order to be worthy of the woman he loves.<br />Of course, as Fitzgerald, through his narrator, the Midwestern transplant and aspiring bond salesman, Nick Carraway, shows, it is not Gatsby who needs to be made worthy at all. There is a certain melodrama to the tale which kind of blunted the edge for me but, on balance, the overwrought tragic overtones in the careless hit and run accident that brings all to a head are more than balanced out by the insight vouchsafed to us by Nick when he tells Gatsby, near the end, that the whole lot of them are not worth Gatsby alone. Gatsby wanders off distractedly to meet his undeserved destiny, thereafter, and Nick remains to pick up the pieces, packing up and returning home to the Midwest in disgust, and something akin to despair, at the human condition when, at last, the full import of what has occurred comes home to him.<br />Fitzgerald had set out to craft a gem with this novel and he succeeded. Though it has flaws, the powerful insight and the polished, lyrical prose more than make up for them, setting this book firmly in the constellation of great American novels.<br />SWMrt of what has occurred comes home to him.<br />Fitzgerald had set out to craft a gem with this novel and he succeeded.

The tale of a ramshackle little western town on the edge of nowhere in the Dakota territory, deriving its lifeblood from a nearby mine, WELCOME TO HARD TIMES grabs us from the beginning with its brutal portrayal of the town's destruction at the hands of a monster of a man who is to remain nameless for much of the tale, a natural force more than a fellow human being. The Bad Man from Bodie savagely rapes and callously kills those in his path including the town whores, the barkeep, the carpenter, the undertaker, the hangers-on, leaving only a few scattered survivors in his wake, after burning the town around them to the ground. In the shadow of his departure, with little hope and much desperation, the handful of survivors rebuild, mainly for want of anything else to do. And the town, after a rigorous winter, prospers. But the mood throughout is ominous and the memory of the Man fron Bodie never far below the surface of the broken people he leaves behind. Doctorow writes with subtlety and irony and his telling is as tight as it gets. Yet I found the ending, deliberately muddled, I suppose, to mimic the sense of collapse, rather a letdown after the crisp narrative that comes before. All breaks down, in the end, in a sudden revelation about the sustaining source of the town's hopes and the Bad Man from Bodie returns without notice, just abruptly appearing in the maelstrom of collapse. This time is a little different from the first in the town's response to the Bad Man, or at least in how the self-proclaimed town mayor and narrator responds. But the results are no less redolent of life's despair and futility. Although the characters are more than the Western stereotypes they at first appear to be, they do not rise above their situations but are sucked sadly back into the storm that blows down upon them from the larger world outside. They are a sad lot and so, we sense, are we all, doomed to live out our lives in hope and desperate striving but never able to gain a foothold in the rock to take us above the level of the town of Hard Times and the life it offers us. This is a fable, writ on Western rock, of living and dying. More subtle and many-layered than the movie it inspired, in the end it is a book of hopelesness and of the raggedness of life itself.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]the larger world outside.

I had never read this one, even as a boy, and so I figured I had to make up for it in my mature years. Maybe that was my error! Although for the most part fast-paced and interesting, I did not find this a very moving or challenging tale and had a great deal of trouble remaining engaged with it. Recounting the vicissitudes of one David Balfour, a young man in rural Scotland who, on the death of his parents is sent off to claim his inheritance, we are taken, along with this David, into the presence of a scurrilous uncle who soon arranges for David's kidnapping to get him out of the way. Adventures aboard a rogue ship, encounters with a swashbuckling Scottish rebel, Alan Breck Stewart, and subsequent flight from the minions of King George through the rugged back country of rural Scotland follow and round out this odyssey of a young man's misfortunes, leading to a predictable denouement in which all is made right. I suppose it was a good tale for its time but I have read better by Stevenson including my favorite among all his works: [[ASIN:0375759301 The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale (Modern Library Classics)]], which is a much more moving and unpredictable tale of two brothers and the shadows of darkness which overwhelm them.

It is the tale of a young Irish monk, Aidan, who is tapped, much to his own surprise, to deliver a precious manuscript from his monastic retreat in medieval Ireland to the Emperor of Byzantium as part of a mysterious embassy whose full purpose he is not completely apprised of. Kidnapped en route by marauding vikings, he does a stint in Scandinavian slavery where he befriends, and is befriended by, his viking captors who eventually drag him down with them to Byzantium (his original destination!) in an abortive raid on a city they are not really prepared to deal with. Falling in with the Byzantine bureaucracy, Aidan and his newfound Norse friends are tapped for a further mission to the Middle East where Islam holds sway and there our young monk is sorely tested and must experience degradations of slavery which make his Scandinavian sojourn a veritable Roman holiday. Unfortunately, the allegedly spiritual experience of our young monk never really hit home for me.

And that, really, is what a work of fiction is supposed to provide us with, isn't it? The book, as a novel, regrettably leaves much to be desired. No sense recounting much more of the plot here since the events have been adequately summarized by others. Suffice it to say, however, that this tale, while nicely told in places, particularly in its presentation of those almost loveable rogues, the vikings, is largely unsuccessful in its efforts to construct a believable and compelling tale. The vikings come across as too humanized . . . you gotta love these guys while they're sitting around the campfire barbecuing and drinking beer as they dispute events from the latest battle, plan for the next and struggle with the metaphysical notions of God and eternity! Of course vikings were like that though somehow we never realized it from the literature of the period, right? At the same time, the city of Byzantium, the real heart of this tale, is rather flimsily realized (barely more than a Potemkin village, unfortunately) while the Arabs are too good and evil by turns. Even the monks are too simple to be believed. In the end, the story, for all its attempts at adventure and \\"byzantine\\" intrigue, didn't resonate for me.

One of the best things an historical novel can do is create a long-ago time and place for us . . . and convince us that what it has given us is how things might really have been. This THE EGYPTIAN does in spades.<br /><br />The tale of an ancient Egyptian physician's life and times, this book follows the events and travels of the aptly named Sinuhe, surnamed He Who is Alone, from his mysterious birth through early childhood into young adulthood and, beyond, to the waning days of a long and troubled life. Cast out and dishonored because of youthful folly (a folly, indeed that he never seems to outgrow), Sinuhe flees the ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes and enters the wider world where he becomes a true man of that world, adventurer and sojourner, physician and spy, while, all along, offering us an up-close look at that world as it might really have been. With him, we visit ancient Babylon and Hatti (land of the Hittites), and Crete where the bull dancers plied their trade. And we are carried back and forth through Egypt and Syria as Sinuhe becomes absorbed in the great events of his day as they worked themselves out on their ancient stage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Sinuhe is also a somewhat tiresome, and even foolish, character who is not always fully sympathetic as he consistently makes doltish choices and throws away what he should hold onto for his very life. He is seemingly caught up in every roiling current the world sends his way, unable to set his own course and, inevitably, an evil fate dogs his tracks for this great failing. But he is, in the process, witness to the rise and fall of the visionary pharaoh Akhenaton and to the great wars which rocked his ancient world and which eventually precipitated the fall of the mighty civilizations of the Bronze Age.<br /><br />In the end, the mood is one of sorrow and resignation in the face of existence itself, a mood that is very redolent of the spirit found in the writings of those ancient times. And so Sinuhe, named for another mythical Egyptian traveler whose story has come down to us in the archaeological records, is very much a creature of his world and that, surely, is an accomplishment for any writer of historical fiction.<br /><br />This is a fine piece of historical writing and one of the better renderings of ancient Egypt and its Bronze Age world that I have found. Aside from Sinuhe's foolishness, I was a little troubled by the somewhat meandering narrative approach with lengthy dead spots and constant coincidences where the same characters consistently run into each other. But basically this was a good one and the fine narrative \\"ear\\" for time and place more than offset the book's other failings.

Rather, Buber's seminal work begins with a key insight into our way of being in the world and goes on to weave an intricate web of variations on this theme, creating, if you let it, a sense of his core insight in the reader's own mind. Reading this book is not about reading a philosophical argument or thesis but rather about giving oneself up to the man and his insight: that there are two fundamental ways for us to be in the world, as subjects relating to objects (in order to use them for ourselves) or as subjects relating to subjects (which recognize ourselves in that which meets us at the other end of the &quot;relation&quot;). For Buber this is what it is all about. And, he tells us, we cannot choose one or the other but must (and do) have both though it is easy for us to lose sight of the subjectness of others when we embrace their objectness. And so he bangs away at the need to see the subjectness, not only in other persons but in other aspects of the world as well, and, indeed, in the world itself, holding that to &quot;see&quot; the subjectness that is there, in the world as a whole (through relating in this manner to its parts), is to see God. And this is where it gets somewhat abstruse for he offers no proof of God in the ordinary sense but rather the assertion alone that we must have access to the subjective aspect of being in order to fully live our lives and that this assumes God. He has no proofs to offer but only an ongoing spiraling prose poem that builds the sense of the world as he has seen it, a realm of subject to subject that overarches and informs the more mundane reality of subject to object in which we are generally mired. If you are looking for a philosophical work that builds an argument with proofs and rational discourse, this is not the book for you. But if you are willing to immerse yourself in his sometimes ecstatic prose, then this offers an experience worth having. Not all philosophy is about building logical edifices or exposing one's thinking to rigorous analytical critiques. Sometimes it's just about insight and seeing the world in a new way. And that is what Buber gave us with this book. -- SWMrse yourself in his sometimes ecstatic prose, then this offers an experience worth having.

If you are interested in the way in which America came to be known in the European world, this book is an excellent \\"place\\" to explore. However, as literature (because that's what the sagas were in the end) the two sagas in this book are not much, i.e., there are quite a few better and more substantial sagas around. So it's kind of hard to give a rating here, using the amazon system, and so I've compromised, splitting the difference, so to speak, to rate this a three! But that shouldn't stop anyone who is interested in this stuff from reading it!<br /><br />This book contains the two extant sagas, sparse and perfunctory both, that record the Norse excursions to North America around the year 1000 and over the decade or so following. Although they ostensibly tell the same story with the same players, they actually contain some very distinct and contradictory elements. Both recount the events which led up to and culminated in the discovery of North America by Norsemen out of Greenland but they offer decidely different versions. In Eirik's Saga, Leif Eiriksson stumbles onto North America on a journey home from Norway where he was commissioned by King Olaf Tryggvesson to spread Christianity in Greenland but it's not clear that he ever really lands there. On the other hand, in the Tale of the Greenlanders Bjarni Herjolfsson does the stumbling, fails to make landfall and later, after much criticism for being incurious by the Greenlanders, sells his ship to Leif who does go there and makes the first settlement.<br /><br />In the Tale, this commences a series of expeditions, first by Leif, then one of his brothers, then his brother-in-law, Thorfinn Karlsefni, out of Iceland, and finally Leif's illegitimate sister who commits a bloody crime there.<br /><br />In Eirik's Saga, on the other hand, the main settler is Thorfinn who, with three ships, seems to compress most of the other expeditions into his own. Leif's illegitimate sister in this saga is a heroine in a battle with American Indians, during Thorfinn's abortive colonization effort, rather than the murderess she is in the Tale.<br /><br />But Eirik's Saga also has some very odd entries including mysterious natives rising up out of the ground, attacking Unipeds and strange white-robed people who are described as marching around with some kind of flails. In both sagas there does appear to be a realistic portrayal of American Indians, suggesting the fundamental truth behind the events reported, however, given the discrepancies in the sequence and characterization of many of the events, it is not unfair to question if either saga is fully reliable.<br /><br />Besides, based on the saga evidence alone, the actual landing locations have never been pinpointed (though there is clear archaeological evidence since the sixties that there was at least a Norse waystation built on the northern most tip of Newfoundland in roughly that period). In sum, these are interesting, indeed fascinating, stories if your interest is in history, especially of the Norse in the New World. However, as literature, they are skimpy and unsatisfying. There are much better sagas out there including Njal's Saga, Laxdaela Saga, Orkneyinga Saga, Grettir's Saga and Egil's Saga, among others.

Both men were accustomed to making waves among their peers, both had reputations for innovative thought which broke new ground, and both had legions of followers and disciples. Wittgenstein, the older and more established of the two, was on his home turf (though, as always, ill at ease in the milieu he had claimed for his own) whereas Popper was something of an outsider, as he had been all his life. Popper apparently went to this philosophical tryst with the intention of overturning Wittgenstein's claim to being the eminence gris of the philosophical world and in order to replace Wittgenstein's vision with his own as the main philosophical theme around which others might rally or debate. He had, he felt, previously done just this with the so-called Vienna Circle's logical postivism which, as a philosophy, had developed under the spell of the early Wittgenstein. So Popper was looking for a reprise of his earlier success, but on a grander scale, as he matched himself up against the thinker who had been the logical positivists' idol. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, seems to have been distracted by personal issues at the time. Overall, this is a marvelous book in the background and insights it offers concerning the two combatants, and those who surrounded them. A little light on the philosophical issues, to be sure, it also takes some liberties when it purports to get us into the heads of the protagonists in the events immediately leading up to and following the encounter. Nor does it offer any real revelation as to who really did what to whom. But, as others here have noted, it is fascinating to try to reconstruct the story, based on eyewitness and near witness accounts in light of the philosophical questions these men were concerned with: what can we know and how can we know it? More, it shows us the very human sides of both men. Like all of us, I suppose, they were not always entirely likable. For my part, I found the comparisons of the Wittgensteinian and Popperian viewpoints quite edifying and that, by itself, made the read worthwhile for me.

A little bit simple and not much on plot, it chronicles this cowboy's growth, from rootless 25 year old cowhand to ranch foreman and, ultimately, success in his own right via the uplifting influence of his passion for a New England school marm, come west to change her own life. Somewhat episodic, it reflects events reported to us by an eastern companion of our hero who, for reasons never described, makes numerous visits to the western ranch of Judge Henry, the Virginian's employer, going from mistrusted tenderfoot to confidant of the new foreman. In the mix is an ongoing feud with the no-good cowhand, Trampas, which culminates in a battle with rustlers and a final showdown that happens so swiftly, and internally within the Virginian's own perceptions, that we almost miss it! Rife with cliches that we may assume were somewhat fresher at the beginning of the twentieth century when this book was written, the tale rises above the noble hero and conflicted school marm at its core to give us a look at how the West really was just as it was losing its frontier flavor. I found the first-person narrative which seemed to drift, repeatedly, into unexplained third-person (since the narrator kept reporting on things and events he could not possibly have known) somewhat clumsy and distracting, but, on balance, this was a most enjoyable read, a Western that transcends its genre to give us a real sense and flavor of another time and place, one that lives on in our American mythology. The characters were not strongly drawn and most were mere shadows in the background, but the Virginian, himself, came through quite clearly and we grow to appreciate this lonely paradigm of the American frontier type who became a staple in the Western mythos.

Shane, unknown and brooding, finds a place for himself at a little farmstead where he is befriended by the farmer's young son, trying desperately to shed his past and make a new and simpler life for himself among the good homesteaders who surround him. But the scheming cattle barons in the area, who control the town and seek to drive the homesteaders out make this impossible. The farmer and his wife who have befriended Shane are already being sucked into a confrontation, not of their own making, in which they must give up everything they have and flee their valley, along with their kind, or stand and fight and be destroyed by the cattlemen who want to keep the range free, at whatever the cost. Shane, the mystery man, tries to help the farmers stand up to the cowboy bullies sent by the ranchers but matters get out of hand when the head rancher, frustrated by Shane's presence and backbone, calls in a ruthless gunman from nearby Cheyenne to bring matters to a head. But Shane is more than what he seems as our little boy narrator and the cattle barons and the farmer and his wife soon find out and the tale culminates in a final confrontation which is emotionally powerful as strong men face one another in a battle for justice and right. A great, if rather short, tale, the epitome of the Old West. I loved this book and the movie that came after it.

For those who love adventure in exotic and far off times and places, Rafael Sabatini was a godsend. And this one is certainly up there among his successes! Here is a tale about an English gentleman of Cornwall, Sir Oliver Tressilian, who is betrayed into ignominy and bondage by a dastardly kinsman who covets Sir Oliver's wealth and, incidentally, safety for himself. Sir Oliver ends up finding a new and successful life in another culture but cannot forgive what has been done to him so that, when the time comes, he cannot but throw all he has won away in a search for vengeance against those who have wronged him. How this all works out (and it's not that hard to predict though fun to follow as it unfolds), is the subject of this tight little tale of Barbary pirates on the Mediterranean. The Arab world is convincingly, if romantically, portrayed as far as it goes but I felt a decided lack in the development of the Muslim characters. They seemed overly simplistic and one-dimensional to me. On the other hand, the English characters weren't much more richly drawn except for brother Lionel, perhaps, as he wrestles with his private demons in seeking a way to resolve the quandary he has got himself into. The lovely Rosamund was just a paper doll, I fear, while Sir Oliver was, himself, little more than the typical tall, handsome, English gentleman with the touch of the rogue in him. Sir John seemed a bit more human in his dull and plodding way. But, in the end, this tale wasn't about characters as much as about action and there's enough of that, along with betrayals and suspense, to keep lovers of historical adventures glued to the pages until the final denouement.

A gentlemanly Irish physician is inadvertently (and innocently) swept up in the aftermath of a rebellion against the king and condemned, thereby, to a life of slavery in the English colonies across the sea. There, on a Caribbean Island plantation, the good Dr. Peter Blood, toils under the hot sun and the hotter eyes of his master's lovely daughter Arabella. A chance raid by Spaniards affords Blood his opportunity to escape and from there it is but a short jump into a life of piracy and crime upon the high seas. But Blood is a pirate with a sense of honor and a longing for the lady he left behind on the abandoned plantation. How this all works out and how Blood distinguishes himself against his enemies is the subject of this very enjoyable historical adventure. I read it years ago when I was a boy and remembered it fondly. Recently picking it up again, with the idea of convincing my own son to read it, I was struck by how enjoyable it still was, though it lacked the depth and dimension I have come to prefer in the reading material of my more mature years. Unfortunately, my son elected not to follow in my footsteps, as he advises me he has no interest whatsoever in pirates. A pity since they made for some really great adventures in fiction if not, perhaps, in fact, and I had hopes he'd share some of these with me. But he prefers a good fantasy any day, as he likes to put it. As though the adventures of Blood and his ilk were not fantastic enough!

So I figured I had to finally attempt such a classic of the genre. Well, it was enjoyable but not really first class, I'm sorry to say. Not up there with IVANHOE or THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS (which, itself, is somewhat flawed) or H. Rider Haggard's ERIC BRIGHTEYES, to name a few. Dumas' famous classic is a tale of a young country bumpkin of the lower Gascon nobility come to the big city (Paris) to make his fortune (by joining the king's elite guard, known as the Musketeers). He quickly stumbles into trouble, even before reaching Paris, and never manages to get clear of it again as one thing leads to another. He hooks up early on with three Musketeers of the guard whom he inadvertently offends and then, rather than dueling each to the death as they demand and he agrees to, he ends up, purely by circumstance (and his naive loyalty to the king), on their side. This all leads to further intrigue and mayhem including a somewhat episodic adventure taking D'Artagnan (our hero) to England on the Queen's urgent business, to foil the Cardinal who is the king's highest and most relied-on minister, and the Queen's enemy at the same time. And the king's sporting competitor in matters of state and the military to boot! There is a sub-plot as well with a scheming and avaricious lady who works for the Cardinal and who has her own fish to fry, and lots of kidnappings and sword fights in the mix. But the characters never really come to life. D'Artagnan and his three friends in the Musketeers are cleverly written and bigger than life but hardly full-blooded or anything but one-dimensional. And D'Artagnan, himself, seems oddly simple and yet, inevitably is described as the cleverest of the four companions who are all a good deal older and more experienced than he is. More strange is D'Artagnan's skill with the sword. From the first he is described as being awkward and somewhat untutored, even in weaponry. Yet, from his initial crossing of swords, he inevitably bests all comers, no matter how much more experienced or skilled they are described as being. In fact, he seems to be the equal of, or superior to, his three Musketeer companions, surpassing them in this skill as he surpasses them in intelligence and cleverness. And yet he is an utter dolt in his dealings with women, a veritable mooning adolescent in the face of the the women he falls for. Nor do the women get treated particularly well by the writer, for their part. I suppose it was the convention of the times but they are all either beautiful and helpless (downright simple, actually) or they are beautiful and deadly. But never do they seem particularly real, from the Queen to Milady to D'Artagnan's objet d'amour, to the lovely servant girl who hankers after D'Artagnan, nearly as moon-eyed as he is about his fancied mistresses. All very strange indeed. I suppose the book broke ground in its time and it is somewhat fun to read, especially after the first third which takes rather a long time to set up all the plot dynamics. But I must say I was frustrated no end by the mindless meanderings and utterly frivolous actions of the four companions as they proceed through their adventures. I mean why would trained soldiers gamble away perfectly good, indeed outstanding, English mounts which they had been gifted, knowing how dear these were and how necessary to men like them? My favorite part of the tale, however, was the four friends' picnic under the Huguenot guns so perhaps this was just in character for them.

But this book is not one of those. ISLAND OF GHOSTS is a tightly written tale of Sarmation cavalry (from the historical land of the Scyths in what is today southern Russia) drafted, through defeat in battle, into the Roman occupying forces in Britain. Tautly told, this one traces the entry of these troops, after a lengthy and unpleasant trek across Europe, into the Roman province of Britain where they are confronted by their uneasy Roman hosts and bitter rivalries and conspiracies among the locals. The hero, a somewhat disheartened Sarmation commander named Ariantes, must manuever and scheme to save his men and their honor in a foreign and markedly hostile environment, in the face of a plot to oust the Romans in favor of a Druidic revival. How he navigates the rock-strewn path he finds before him, in the face of his own sense of a living death-in-exile, and learns to accept others for what they are make up the bulk of this well-wrought story. The tale, though a might predictable and peopled by the usual cast of stock characters one would expect to find in such a book, is still immensely entertaining and keeps you turning the pages. The view of the Romans and Britains of the time also rings true while the voice, though contemporary in its phrasings, is subtly enough rendered that you barely notice. It never really seems to slip into anachronistic modernisms despite its fealty to the conventions of modern fiction. Indeed, while on reflection, I thought some of the turns of phrase out of place, I barely noticed these as I was reading and so felt quite comfortable with the narrative as it drove relentlessly onward to a most satisfying conclusion. If I thought that Ariantes seemed a bit too modern, too sensitive, indeed, too enlightened, for a \\"barbarian\\" commander who was accustomed to scalping his enemies, I must happily add that it did not bother me in the reading. And that is testament enough to a well turned tale. In sum, I liked this one and read it in two days without ever feeling a need to come up for air.

Pressfield has here done a very nice job of recreating what might have been the world of the Amazons on the southern steppes of today's Russia, and that clash of cultures which may have occurred when Bronze Age Greek adventurers stumbled across these warrior women, as seems to be echoed in the remnants of old Greek legend. But his story is over the top in the end. He takes too long to spin out the tale and the complex artifice he has adopted for the telling (a narrator recounting what she has seen and heard from other participants in their own \\"voices\\") works against the matter. More, his characters never spring fully to life. I could not easily differentiate Damon from Elias, or even the idealized Theseus (with whom I could never entirely empathise) from Prince Atticus, while Eleuthera and Selene and Antiope and Hypolita (spelling?) all seemed to me little more than archetypes. The writing, indeed, was expansively poetic and in places well-wrought enough to move me but there was too much of this, as well. Over and over again, the narrators, Selene or Damon, through the voice of Bones, repeat the same chant-like litany of names and peoples. It grew to be too much and overly distracting.<br /><br />In sum, I am led to conclude that Pressfield, riding the crest of his recent successes, has here let himself go artistically . . . and who is to nay-say such a successful writer? Unwilling or unable to bring his narrative to a natural conclusion, he lets it spin out too long, with apparent ending after apparent ending, until the reader (or this reader at least) grows tired of the effort. And while the first half was brisk and enjoyable to read, the second, with its war against Athens, was much slower, despite the action on the field, and marred by an overemphasis on the military campaign to the detriment of its participants' characters. Indeed even the exploits of the heroes (Theseus with broken arm and leg and other assorted wounds, including a nearly smashed skull, dashing about in heroic battle) seemed a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />Pressfield did, however, do a very fine job of bringing the legendary Amazon nation itself to life, even if his characters were less than real, but the unfurling of events seemed stilted and overly stylized, while it was hard to engage with the characters so that the freshness of the Greek legend seemed somehow to be lost. (I thought Robert Graves did it better in his now nearly forgotten HERCULES, MY SHIPMATE which recounted the adventures of Jason and his Argonauts, in roughly the same region, as they searched for the Golden Fleece.) It's painful to be so critical here since I am a fan of Pressfield since GATES OF FIRE, but I suppose it is hard to sustain the champion's pace all the time. This is a good one, worth reading if you love legend and adventure in the form of historical fiction, but it's not the best Pressfield I've read.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]in heroic battle) seemed a bit of a stretch.

And yet this one didn't work for me as well as it might have.<br />Actually, it started off rather nicely (lots of books which get published these days seem to) but it didn't really carry through. In the end it was a rather pedestrian tale, with little staying power once I'd  closed the covers . . . though it was readable enough.<br />I think it suffered from the decision to make it a trilogy since you don't really see that in the beginning and when the story finally winds down to its climactic battle (and &quot;winds down&quot; is not a poor way of putting it), it leaves the reader rather cold . .  . as though the book just ground to a halt, mid-stream, with everything still to be determined! The story, itself, while workmanlike, was also quite uninspired. Not much insight here into the times portrayed or the people who filled those times.<br />In fact, the only real character of interest was Merlin, portayed as a quick change artist, although his presence is telegraphed well before he reveals himself to the seeking Arthur. Who Arthur really was and what he did remains something of a mystery . . . but he sure wasn't much, or worth all those legends, if this was him.<br />I hate it when the promise of the first few pages gets broken and scattered between the covers of a book. But that's what happened here. Based on the first volume, I decided to forego the next two installments, for better or worse. But others, plainly, do not share my disappointment so perhaps I am being unduly harsh. The book is readable, though it did not meet my expectations! Give it a try if Arthurian tales are your thing. In light of all the positive reviews here, I may just have been the wrong reader for this one.<br />SWM	2002-07-14

I must be getting old since I've never done this sort of thing before, but I was so frustrated after about 70 pages of this book that I brought it back to the store. Expecting a solid historical novel set in the declining days of Roman Britain, I found that it started off smartly enough . . . lots of action tautly presented (apparently essential in today's market if you want to see your stuff published). But the tale just didn't catch fire. Told from the protagtonist Publius Varrus' point of view, the story sputters along as our hero leads an expedition into the British hinterlands to trade for iron (becoming ever scarcer as the Roman occupation winds down), stops to slaughter some invading Celts and burn their ship, rushes back to sit by the fire with his superior Caius Britannicus (of solid, old Roman stock and an old friend) to decry the aging process, etc., then dallying gratuitously with the lascivious wife of another friend (who finally kills her in a rage, along with everyone else in his household and himself), and listening to his own fine upstanding mate bemoan the moral deterioration in their little Roman colony as a harbinger of terrible things to come! All in the first 70 pages or so -- I couldn't take much more of it and shut the book, rushing it back to the store to reclaim my cash. Haven't given up on historical novels but this one clearly didn't work for me. Perhaps I am just growing less patient as my own aging process sets in. Still many others here liked the book so perhaps I just didn't stay with it long enough to give it a fair chance. The truth is my eyes aren't what they used to be so I don't want to waste them reading things which don't take off in some fashion for me. And this one just didn't. -- SWM	2002-07-14

It resonates in the great Norse sagas, as so many famous Icelanders and Norsemen took part in it, and historically because it was a turning point in the Irish battle against the viking incursion. Ms. Holland here offers a very nice literary rendering of the time and its  events in this, her tale of a renegade clan chief, driven to side with the insurgent king Maelmordha and his viking allies in their doomed bid to unseat Brian the high king.<br /><br />Muirtagh o' Cullinane is a fascinating anti-hero who is too small to fight sword to sword against bigger men and so has perfected his archery as a counterweight in the world of warriors. An accomplished harpist, and thoughtful beyond the measure of most of his contemporaries, Muirtagh is the victim of a generational feud with the clan mac Mahon which has all but wiped out the bulk of his kin. Struggling to suppress the blood feud for fear it will result in the wholesale destruction of his remaining family members, Muirtagh is finally drawn back into it through the killing of his younger brother. Driven into exile and outlawry as a result of this killing and his dramatic response to it, Muirtagh finds uneasy comradery with his country's viking enemies and is present at the final showdown which resolved the longstanding threat of the Dublin vikings.<br /><br />Although the story is somewhat slow in the beginning, it picks up sharply with the killing that forces Muirtagh into exile and becomes truly fascinating when he finds himself in the company of viking killers in Dublin. The overall depiction of Irish clan culture and the final battle at Clontarf are wonderfully done though I must admit I thought the ending rather a letdown. I would have preferred something less anti-climactic in its denouement and which also served to resolve many of the threads Holland had earlier sewn into her tapestry, rather than the almost tossed off finish to this tale that she offers. But, on balance, this one's a good one and will, I suspect, please those who, like me, enjoy the tales of older times, particularly when set around the North Atlantic world of old Europe.<br /><br />SWM[[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]admit I thought the ending rather a letdown.

But Decently Done	Based on the tale of Earl Thorfinn Sigurdsson of Orkney, as found in the Orkneyinga Saga, the man who some scholars take for the historical Macbeth, Lady Dorothy Dunnett has here reimagined the life and times of that famous Scottish king. Three parts Celt and one part Norse, this Orkney earl extended the domain bequeathed him by his viking forebears (the Orkney Islands as well as some northern coastal territory on the Scottish mainland) deep into that land that would one day be Scotland, establishing, for all intents and purposes, the first unified Scottish kingdom.<br /><br />Though his kingdom was not to last, Thorfinn-Macbeth is portrayed as a magnificent visionary who grows from a somewhat reckless, albeit coldly clever and scheming, viking chieftain into a true king, genuinely concerned for the wealth and weal of his newly won kingdom. The tale, itself, is not highly structured but affects to recreate the life of this marauder cum royal prince from his first heedless days in the shadow of Norway's King Olaf the Stout and Denmark's Canute the Great (who briefly carved out an Atlantic empire for himself incorporating England, Denmark and, in the end, Norway), to his final days in the shadow of Harold Godwinsson, William of Normandy and Harald Hardrada, the last genuine viking king of Norway.<br /><br />Following the life and career of the Orkney earl, Thorfinn, Dunnett creates a very different Macbeth from the man Shakespeare gave us. This Macbeth, an ungainly and ugly looking fellow, is head and shoulders above his fellows both physically and intellectually. More, he is, at bottom, a sensitive soul who, though his first introduction to his future wife, after killing her husband in battle, is barely more than rape, grows to love her as she comes to love him. Their joint career takes them headlong into rule of the future Scottish kingdom with some fascinating detours along the way including the tale of Thorfinn's struggles with the magnificent Rognvald Brusasson, his golden haired nephew (Ms. Dunnett offers a most unusual interpretation of the relationship which led to the famous burning of the earl's house) and engagement in the political maneuvering then going on in the south of England in light of Canute's early death without a strong heir to succeed him.<br /><br />Although this novel had long barren stretches (I especially found the interlude on the European mainland, as Thorfinn made his way to Rome, frustratingly tiresome and longwinded), the book, on balance, was intelligently done. If it moved too slowly in places, it largely made up for it with well-wrought scenes of battle on the seas and deep in Scotland itself and with some fascinating dialogue. Regrettably, Ms. Dunnett does have a tendency to resort to a kind of cryptic rendering of both dialogue and description, which overdoes the subtlety I think she was pursuing. And I found too many of her characters rather difficult to distinguish from one another. Occasionally, too, she slips into a surprising error such as a description of the Byzantines in which she refers to the Ottoman crown (which, of course, is a major anachronism since the Ottomans didn't conquer Constantinople until 1453 while her tale takes place in the eleventh century). More, she goes on too long in places since I found her repeating herself rather too often, adding an unneeded burden to this already very large novel.<br /><br />But, if it is not the best of its type (and I am reminded here of Hope Muntz' historical novel, THE GOLDEN WARRIOR, about many of the same characters in roughly the same time period which, perhaps, really is), this one is certainly a good one and worth the attention of intelligent readers attracted to historical fiction, especially when set in this time period and this corner of the world.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]d nephew (Ms. Dunnett offers a most unusual interpretation of the relationship which led to the famous burning of the earl's house) and engagement in the political maneuvering then going on in the south of England in light of Canute's early death without a strong heir to succeed him.

Because it is largely a record of conversations, albeit edited afterwards by the participants, it is necessarily superficial in some areas and, therefore, does not always give the fullest rendition of the ideas of the thinkers who are its subjects. And yet it offers some very nice explications of some rather difficult stuff. In some sense it is probably of more interest to the professional (or those, at least, with some real background in philosophy) since so much of the material is highly technical and handled so quickly that, lacking a preliminary understanding of the concepts being elucidated, one is likely to miss much. Still some of the material is absolutely superb. The section on Heidegger, for instance, helped me to understand that very obscurantist thinker in a way that elucidated what had always been opaque for me before. And the last section, on Wittgenstein, gave me a new feel for his very subtle and profound view of things. In fact, I read the section on Wittgenstein first (even though it's the book's final offering) and then, having finished the rest of the book, returned to it again. And then I found it even richer than on the first go-round. Other areas particularly worth delving into included the sections on Plato and Aristotle, and on Locke and Hume. On the other hand, I thought the exposition of Kant's thought a bit lacking and that on the Pragmatists rather too swiftly dealt with and not nearly as useful as I'd hoped. Berkeley, too, gets short shrift; but the offerings on Spinoza and Leibniz and, later Frege and Russell were very useful. In sum, a good intro for those who are not starting in this business from scratch and, certainly, a fine platform from which to go on to further readings, as one must, after this, given the fact that so much of the material is so cursorily handled. -- SWMs so cursorily handled. -- SWM	2002-06-16

Francisco, the Crusading protagonist, seemed to me too infused with a twentieth century sensibility to ring true (as was his buddy Andres and Andres' sister, the lovely and apparently quite liberated Isabel), while Brother Lucas, the exorcist of record, seemed too silly and venal to have been really effective. However, I did like the subtle presentation of modern psychological theory in a medieval context of devils and demons and possession and the story really did pick up for me in the second half when Francisco and Andres find themselves in the midst of their long-sought Crusade.<br /><br />Never mind that their motivations in getting there feel more like those of some young moderns choosing to enlist in a Vietnam-like conflict or that their reactions to what they finally see in the Holy Land are more reminiscent of our modern distaste for war's excesses than reflective of what people of that time might really have said or felt. In fact, too much of their combined reactions seemed out-of-century to me, particularly when, witnessing an obvious war-crime (the rape and slaughter of women and children and the eating of the bodies of some of the slain), Francisco is moved to liken his compatriots to a \\"tribe of cannibals\\". Of course the Europeans didn't fully become aware of such \\"tribes\\" until centuries later when they encountered these in the South Seas, in the Americas and in Africa, so this image appears quite out of place. Later when the loveable and honorable Crusader, Uncle Ramon, tells his nominal superior that what has occurred \\"was incompatible with our mission\\", one hears echoes of My Lai, making for further historical dissonance.<br /><br />Both Francisco and Andres are, of course, mortified at the excesses of their brethren and soon disillusioned by the miseries of medieval warfare. Still, the later part of the book, in which they find their moral bearings and sensitivities, is extremely well-done and stands out for its clarity of focus and excellent pacing, more than making up for the slowness that went before. As the tale picks up steam in its second half, one really has a feeling of being there and the book becomes hard to lay aside. By the time our heroes are in Baibars' prison I was completely hooked as the underlying cause of Francisco's \\"possession\\" became clear, lending real tension to how the tale, told in flashback, would work itself out in the \\"real time\\" of Brother Lukas' exorcism. (I did, by the way, like the final, swashbuckling sword fight, which was very nicely handled, though I wondered what happened to Brother Vial and felt let down by the fight's ultimate outcome as given in the epilogue.)<br /><br />A word about technique: I have seen quite a few books done with unreliable narrators and with competing perspectives, just like this one, so this is not new in Mr. Eisner's work. Still he handled it better than some I have read although I thought his decision to go this route unnecessarily and almost self-consciously precocious as it did not, in my opinion, add significantly to the telling of his tale. But, on balance, I liked this book (since I read it through in a single day and it takes a lot, these days, to get me to do that). But I thought it could have been richer if his characterizations had had more \\"flesh\\" to them and he'd avoided the discordances of anachronistic perspectives.

The American, adrift in Salzburg Austria as a Vice Consul responsible for approving visa applicants to the United States, encounters an old man who is desperate to emigrate because he can no longer sustain himself in his native village. The foreign service officer dutifully quizzes the man, only to discover a problem in his background. And yet he is not without sympathy for this applicant's plight and so, with only a vague idea of what he is doing and, perhaps, from a sense of boredom with the humdrum pace of things in the Consulate, the American befriends his Austrian supplicant in an effort to find a way around the legal obstacle he has uncovered.<br /><br />As he gets sucked deeper into this man's world, he tries desperately to find what he hopes will be the truth lying behind the words, a truth which will enable the American to grant the prized visa. But, while their odd friendship grows, the story the elderly Austrian has to tell seems to become sorrier and sorrier with each revelation as the Vice Consul begins to see flaws and to suspect he has been lied to on a larger scale. Persisting out of a sort of dogged empathy with the old fellow, the tale he finally wins from the Austrian shakes his confidence in the very job he has sworn to perform while awakening him to his own slow drift into emptiness and old age.<br /><br />Here is a tale of two men of very different generations and cultures who connect, in an odd sort of way, through the search of one for a new life . . . and the other for a life he has not yet lived.

As a lover of the Icelandic sagas, I can say I've had the opportunity to read quite a few.

Gudrun belongs to an illustrious family and soon comes into the orbit of an even more illustrious one, that of Olaf the Peacock. While this tale, like all true sagas, spans several generations, the core of the book revolves around the fair Gudrun and the men she encounters and enters into relationships with. But it's a tragic tale in the end, as well, because Gudrun, proud and unforgiving as any Norseman in the saga world, cannot give way and is thus doomed to lose the one man she may have desired most of all. It falls, finally, to her son, born after the killing of her third husband, to bring a kind of rough Icelandic justice to those who brought down the father he never knew, while Gudrun, in her old age, remains typically taciturn, unable to tell him who it was she cared for most, the man who sired him or the one whose death she sought.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	2002-01-23

As you can see from the caption I've offered above, I was disappointed by this one. I'm fascinated by adventure and exotic locales and this, a fictionalized real-life portrayal of one of Conrad's youthful experiences while sailing about on the high seas, promised a very bracing adventure indeed. It's the author's recollection of the difficult events surrounding the first time he took command of a vessel of his own -- reluctantly as he tells us, being almost forced into it by events and people around him. It proves an ill-fated step, as well, since the vessel he is asked to reclaim is laid up in a Southeast Asian harbor minus its captain, who has mysteriously given up the ghost, and with a crew that is ill from some undisclosed fever. The narrator gets slowly into the tale and then bogs down with the slow moving current as the ship of ailing men gets underway only to become trapped in a becalmed sea, unable to make headway to its port of call in Singapore, even as its crewmen grow increasingly ill and the on-board medication gives out. The narrator, our youthful first-time captain, struggles to keep the ship moving and at the ready for the first break in the uncanny weather they are experiencing while the first mate hallucinates over the ghostly machinations of the recently departed prior captain who, he suspects, is operating from beyond the grave to bring his former ship and crewmen down. Our young, first-time captain berates himself roundly for his supposed blunders including failing to check the medicine supply fully before shipping out and, though it remains unsaid, for possibly acting too precipitously to get underway, before ascertaining that the worst of the fever had passed among the crew. The ship's steward, a bold and knowledgeable seahand suffers from a bad heart which causes him to avoid any kind of hard effort though he manages to rise to the occasion when the need is finally there. Basically, this true life tale had the makings of a rousing adventure but Conrad doesn't ever allow it to become that, either because of his fidelity to the facts or because of his own inimitably verbose and abstract writing style. But, whatever the cause, I was disappointed in the book and put it down at last, barely moved.

What follows from this is that the supposition that the biblical tales of David and Solomon's unified Israelite kingdom may no longer be reliable and more, that the actual post Bronze Age flowering of culture in the area didn't take place until the development of the kingdom of Israel in the northern hills, contrary to the report in the Bible which tells us that the northern kingdom was the residual portion of a mighty empire, a breakaway tribal state established after the death of Solomon. What does this mean for our understanding of biblical history? Simply put, that the Bible would have been a product of a very different set of developments than the history it reports and thus its historical veracity is questionable at best. If Israel in the north was really the first kingdom, then whence came Judah, the state ruled by the so-called Davidic kings? According to the authors, Judah came later, as indicated in the archaeological record of the area, and only reached its height after the destruction of Israel, its more sophisticated and powerful northern neighbor, had been utterly destroyed by the Assyrian juggernaut. Refugees from the more cosmopolitan, and somewhat pagan, Israel fled into the wild and more inaccessible, and less resource-rich, hills of Judah and this infusion of more cultured people of a similar ethnic heritage led to an abrupt flowering of the Judahite land. In this context, with Judah suddenly experiencing a surge in its population and seeking to assert itself in the region, the newly combined population group, reflecting the rich skills of the new immigrants and their natural interest in the land they left behind, devised for itself a common history, including a legendary unified kingdom under the Davidic kings of Judah to justify a policy of expansion into the more or less abandoned lands of ancient Israel. This, in a nutshell, is the thesis of this book and from it the authors explore the implications for the entire biblical narrative. They weave a convincing tale although much depends on current and future finds in the archaeological tels of modern Israel and Palestine. If you hold the Bible to be absolute truth, then this book will not please you. But if you have an open mind and are interested in the possibilities, wherever they lead, and you're fascinated by biblical issues and tales, then this book is for you. -- SWMjustify a policy of expansion into the more or less abandoned lands of ancient Israel.

The tone and \\"voice\\" feel right, speeding along brilliantly, while the tale, of a young fellow's awakening from gawking naivete to a certain street-smart cynicism, rings remarkably true. If there is a reason for reading fiction today, BILLY BATHGATE offers the perfect example: it is a means for carrying us into places and times now long gone which still may resonate in the contemporary soul. While the hero is a trifle too cloying for my tastes and seems rather more inured to the moral chaos he sees around him than his apparent sensibility suggests he should be, this is, finally, a small fault to find with such a deflty turned tale. Progressing from a 15-year old loner on street corners to mascot of the Dutch Schultz gang, as they hurtle down the spiral of their final decline, the self-named Billy Bathgate insinuates himself into the precarious confidences of this remakably unstable crew. Schultz, himself, the erratic gang leader, has already slipped into a dangerous condition of paranoia and isolation and his hangers-on live from moment to moment in fearful unease, unable to check the excesses of their leader or to separate themselves from him. Billy finds their life oddly mesmerizing as he gets sucked into witnessing outbursts of murder and coldly planned gangland executions, until his role brings him into the orbit of a flighty, if beautiful, society doll. Then a burgeoning adolescent crush seems to awaken him to what he has done and, as in a dream, he begins to seek a way out. The ending comes swiftly and will surprise those who have not yet seen the movie (which captures much, but not all, of the written tale). And yet the wrap-up is a little bit of a let-down (rather too pat, actually) and I longed to know more of who and what this Billy turned out to be. Yet, on balance, this was a fine novel and evidence, indeed, for the solid reputation Doctorow has earned.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]his Billy turned out to be.

Because of its decidedly unscholarly flipness and the fact that it is nothing more than a compendium of little known (or little remembered) facts about the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), I've been somewhat stinting in my rating of this book. Still it is a valuable and enlightening presentation of what's really in those ancient works which we are all taught to revere here in the Western world.<br />In fact, the material contained in the biblical writings is often shocking and out of step with our modern mores and sensibilities. Reading some of that stuff today, you can't help being scandalized and, if some of it weren't in THE BIBLE, you'd want to disregard it or toss it away. But the ancient religious literature of the Western world also has its share of valuable and spiritually uplifting insights, though these don't rise to the top in Davis' book. Still, unless you take a fundamentalist view and believe every word in the bible to be sacrosanct and infallibly written and preserved over the past three thousand years (and intelligible, thereafter, in our modern languages), Davis' book is worth retaining and mining for the iconcoclastic viewpoints he offers.<br />But beware: author Davis is necessarily focusing on the controversial and troubling aspects of &quot;the good book&quot; in an effort to shake us out of our Sunday School-induced fantasies and broaden our perspectives. I think he succeeds in doing this. But I wish he'd had some insights of his own to offer rather than merely latching onto the more controversial and troubling aspects of these texts. Or just parroting the mainstream of biblical criticism, as he does (despite the fact that there are a multiplicity of conflicting views and theories in that area of study and no single solid explanation of how the bible came to be written or who first wrote and preserved it, or what kinds of societies really generated it).<br />But I guess that wasn't what this kind of book is about. Anyway, it is a great antidote to claims for an overly literal biblical interpretation or to those who maintain that the bible is somehow more valid than other historical documents mankind has written and preserved over the generations.<br />SWMdote to claims for an overly literal biblical interpretation or to those who maintain that the bible is somehow more valid than other historical documents mankind has written and preserved over the generations.<br />SWM	2001-10-14

I'm rather enamored of adventures and historicals and, among my favorites, are tales of the Dark and Middle Ages. So when I noticed this one, a re-print of a book by Edison Marshall, who wrote many tales in this vein back in the fifties, I rushed to order it. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. It's a decent enough interpretation of the Arthurian legend, offering a realistic reconstruction of how the tale might have originally arose, based on the older Welsh elements. And the prose, especially at the beginning, really wowed me as it seemed rolling and poetic and fresh. But the tale, itself, finally bogged down, being laden with flat and lifeless characters and a predictability which, combined with the dull players, caused me to want to give up on the book half way through. But I didn't surrender to that impulse, primarily because I wanted to do this review (not a great reason to finish a book, I'll grant you). In the end this tale did not soar as I'd hoped it would and the lively, fresh writing with which it began became staler, along with the tale it was telling. Even the Arthur character never fully became clear, remaining a somewhat unsympathetic bumbler to the end, not at all convincing as king or hero. If you like adventure or Arthurian material you might find that this one suits you. But clearly it didn't work for me though I must admit, I'm a harder sell these days than I used to be. Three stars for the workman-like quality of the prose. Othwerwise I'd have rated it lower.<br /><br />SWM<br /><br />[[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	2001-10-09

As a kid I was fascinated by science fiction and loved, as well, the mythic worlds of earlier times. Among my favorites were the northern mythologies of the Norse and related Scandinavian peoples. I also had a soft spot in my heart for old fashioned Celtic mythology. And so, when I stumbled onto Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS in my teens (a long time ago indeed!), I was practically floored, since it melded all these elements together into a new kind of tale: high fantasy with an epic cast to it. In truth Tolkien's great work grew out of a very deep cultural vein and had many serious antecedents that came before and set the stage for it, both in modern and pre-modern times (the Greek epic cycles, the medieval chansons de geste, the Amadis of Gaul texts, to name a few). And yet, for me then, his tale was entirely new. I think I read the RING trilogy first, before THE HOBBIT, but am no longer entirely certain. However, in whatever sequence I first found these books, they were utterly delightful and spoiled most science fiction and fantasy for me afterwards because they were so hard to match in terms of breadth of vision, depth of feeling and vividness of the world painted by their author's vigorous and yet very precious prose. Not entirely innovative but largely derivative of the older mythologies, they yet innovated in the way they combined these (Celtic and Norse and Christian and Manichean) into a single and coherent whole. These books tell an epic tale of a quest to destroy a mighty talisman of power, a quest which combines the world-ending themes of the Norse Ragnarok and end-of-days religious fundamentalism with the uplifting feel of revitalization that grows from a cleansing battle between the forces of good and evil. The world we live in, of course, isn't anything like this but it's a tribute to the vision and power of Tolkien as a writer that our own world seems pale by comparison with the one he invented for us, invented out of the whole cloth of ancient myths and traditions. And yet, though I find myself eagerly anticipating the upcoming film, dramatizing the first book of the trilogy (previous animated attempts failed to do it justice), I must say that, looking back on the tale now, I am struck by certain problems with it. Very much in keeping with its northern vantage point (the main source of the Tolkien mythos), it is marred by its apparent linking of goodness with racial types, i.e, the evil orcs and southern men are variously portrayed as dark-skinned, with sloping heads and slanting eyes and as, therefore, somehow removed from humanity because of this, marked as closer to the corrupting evil of the enemy, Sauron. And, of course, the main characters who are the good guys are largely fairy tale types who, while multi-faceted and subject to great temptation, in the end are not fully humanized. Now Tolkien was writing a high fantasy in a hoary and respected tradition and within those terms he delivered a magnificent and literally flawless masterpiece (complete with invented languages and histories which lend an added aura of authenticity to his work). But his vision was very Eurocentric in the end and I've always wondered how people of non-European background or those who are just sensitive to this sort of thing deal with the awkward stereotyping his vision displayed. It will certainly be interesting to see how the filmmakers handle the more politically incorrect aspects of his great tale. And yet great tale it was and is, despite these minor quibbles, telling a grand story with mighty themes and touching many of the chords which myth and legend generally pluck in our very human hearts.

I read the Anabasis, the narrative by the Greek historian Xenophon, upon which this book is based, many years back and, when I saw this book, I was pleasantly surprised that someone had actually taken a crack at novelizing it.<br /><br />The original text of the Anabasis essentially records the vicissitudes of a troop of Greek mercenaries who got stuck in the middle of the Persian empire, far from their native Hellenic hills, on the wrong side of a civil war between two Persian bluebloods. With their leader and employer taking an untimely powder in the midst of the critical battle, they are left without a patron, ten thousand against a hundred thousand or more, and no way out across a vast inhospitable desert lying between them and their Mediterranean road home, while being shadowed by a treacherous Persian general.<br /><br />How they pull it together in the face of incredible hardships and fight their way home again is the crux of this tale . . . and it's a rousing one. Still, having read Xenophon, I was faced with the fact that there was little suspense for me in this adventure since I already knew how the basic narrative would work itself out. Worse, the interior sub-plots were all too easy to second guess, while the characters were not as sharply drawn as I'd have liked and so not as compelling, for their part, as they might have been.<br /><br />More, there was a rather distant, abstractness to the writing itself that tended to leave me a trifle cold. It did not engage me as much as Pressfield's GATES OF FIRE had, the novel about the Spartan stand against Xerxes' invading Persians, roughly a generation or so before the events which Xenophon recorded. In fact, Pressfield's book's success probably inspired the decision to publish this one, though that, by itself, is not necessarily an adverse comment on this work. This tale is, in fact, nicely written and a well-wrought tribute to the Anabasis, despite my carping above. It is, despite its flaws, a vivid and convincing recreation of the ancient world in the time of the Greek Golden Age and that mighty Persian empire with which the Greeks alternately fought and dickered. Although the philosophizing built into the narrator's voice left me a trifle cold, as it seemed to be more for effect (to mimic the Greek penchant for reflecting deeply), than to really present a coherent and insightful world view . . . or to raise great questions . . .  I found the narrator's \\"voice\\" reasonably convincing despite the modern tone it set.<br /><br />I did find a few irritating errors, however, the most annoying being the reference to the upper Euphrates River near the end when a glance at the map on the inside cover clearly shows the upper Tigris to have been meant (unless that map got it wrong -- I don't know, myself, since I didn't go back to check my atlas).<br /><br />Oh and one rather clever maneuver kind of stuck out for me: a quote attributed to the Gallic Yourcenar, a personage with which I am entirely unfamiliar, though I note the author thanks a colleague of the SAME last name in his afterword! A clever ploy indeed.<br /><br />On balance, I really did like this one since it brought Xenophon's narrative to life in a somewhat modern idiom which still manages to sucessfully evoke the ancient world from which it was sprung. And, if it was not wholly satisfying for lack of suspense and vivid characters, well, at the least, it did its job in breathing life into the ancient text. I looked for more from this book than I got. But, in truth, I got enough.

Still it lives on vividly enough in my memory to allow a review, here, I think.<br />Joyce was a strange one, where writing was concerned, focusing as he did on language as a means to evoke the world rather than merely for telling a &quot;story&quot;. Over the years I have come to conclude that fiction requires narrative requires storytelling . . . and yet Joyce successfully broke that rule and he did it first in this book.<br />PORTRAIT is a book which builds the world of its narrator in the telling, without really following any kind of plot or storyline or giving us a beginning, middle and end. From the opening lines of ludicrous baby talk, where we see the world through the young hero's infantile eyes, to the end where the young lad, after much intellectual wrestling in his school days, steps off into the wider world, this is a book which paints a young man's coming of age, through his very subjective experience of life, with words. Indeed, all good writing &quot;paints&quot; its world to some extent. But Joyce, and several of his contemporaries, set out to re-write the rules of writing by only painting the picture, as though the story (an artificial element in most cases) did not count at all. And they did what they set out to do. Joyce did it most dramatically of all with this book. Like Hemingway, Joyce was a literary impressionist, building the world through bits of language instead of merely describing it or telling us about it.<br />I think we need to get back to basic story in our day, as theirs was, to some extent, a false trail. But it was a trail worth following and of great value to all readers and writers alike. Aspiring writers, and anyone with a real craving to explore the literary world, ought to have a go at this one.

Still, I'll have a go.<br />THE SUN ALSO RISES was Hemingway's breakthrough novel. And what a breakthough it was. Before it, he had modest success with his short stories (a literary form of which he was a master, to be sure). But it was this novel that made his reputation stateside (he was an expatriate in Paris, just like the characters in this novel, at the time he wrote and published it).<br />The book reads like a prolonged short story which is, in fact, its great strength. It is a slice of life, of very particular lives to be sure, painted in that finely crafted impressionist style which Hemingway honed in his days as a literary apprentice in Kansas City, Chicago and on the Left Bank of post World War I Paris. Briefly, the book details the escapades of a group of expatriates living it up in dissolute pleasure in the wake of the recently finished war in a recovering and still giddy Europe. Giddy, at least, within the crowded milieu in which these people mainly move. It has no plot to speak of, except for the movement of its people in and out of bars, parties and bull fights, and their conversations in cafes and taxis and, on occasion,in rural hunting lodges, most of which embody a tight and elaborate dance of almost ritual posturing. The tale follows them as they move cautiously about one another, and through various parts of Europe from their Parisian base, seeking connection and a tenuous spiritual sustenance which may only be had in the hurly-burly of a nightlife world of their own making, a world in which past troubles and insecurities can momentarily be forgotten. At its heart the novel follows, most of all, the growth of one man, its main character, from morose outsider in love with the unattainable to a person who sees his world all too clearly and, recognizing this, severs himself at the end from what he most desires. Nothing happens and yet everything does, precisely reflecting the emotional landscape through which the tale progresses.<br />I will add my voice to some others here, as well, regarding the inimitable Hemingway style, a style he fashioned (not entirely in a vacuum, of course) from the world of experimentalist writers and painters in which he immersed himself in his Paris years. At its best, the sort of writing with which he has crafted this fascinating novel explodes into the reader's consciousness, creating a sense of reality and freshness that previous forms of prose had failed to attain. It is poetry as much as prose for its rhythms and repetitive stress on simple, basic words which combine, at times, to build an image in the mind, a concrete sense of the real world which puts to shame all the abstractions and florid prose of previous literary works.<br />But there's no sense in trying to recapitulate the story here or to describe how it's told. The best thing is for the reader to step into it and experience it. It is still fresh and strong today and worth your time.y voice to some others here, as well, regarding the inimitable Hemingway style, a style he fashioned (not entirely in a vacuum, of course) from the world of experimentalist writers and painters in which he immersed himself in his Paris years.

Hemingway, at his best, was a master of the short story form and a reasonably good, though not outstanding, novelist. At his death he left a number of unfinished manuscripts, material in various stages of development that he was working on and, in some cases, struggling with. Knowing this, I hesitated to pick this book up for a long time, not wanting to read the master's own discards and figuring he knew what was good enough for publication and what was not and that what he left, at his death, was manifestly not.<br />Reading ISLANDS IN THE STREAM some years back, I felt confirmed in this belief for that was a clumsy and self-absorbed effort and I think he must have known that. Later, I had a similar experience when I tried TRUE AT FIRST LIGHT, the most recent posthumous addition to his opus. More recently, however, I was bored for lack of fresh reading material and so picked up THE GARDEN OF EDEN to read on a plane trip.<br />Although this one was unfinished at his death and ends in such a fashion as to drive that sad point home, it is nevertheless outstanding Hemingway. Aside from a few lapses here and there and the usual Hemingway tendency toward an almost juvenile self-absorption, this one positively hums with the power of the old Hemingway prose. As sharp and subtle as his best short fiction and as fresh and dynamic as his best novel, THE SUN ALSO RISES, this book unfolds, in crisply vivid detail, the struggle of a youthful writer to hang onto his sense of self-worth and devotion to his work in the face of his passionate love for a difficult and spoiled woman.<br />Yet it's plain why Hemingway may have agonized over this one and held it back from publication, for the man it reveals is not the public persona he cultivated for most of his life. The protagonist in this tale, an avatar of the author (as in most of his works), is here a passive and unassertive sort who is unable to deal effectively with the woman he has married. Instead he succumbs to one of her whims after another though he feels they will somehow unman him, allowing her to change him outwardly while losing himself in the satisfaction of his writing, the only thing, besides his wife, we are led to believe he really loves. And yet when his wife brings another woman into their lives to create a menage a trois, the hero does not rebel though he finds himself more and more a plaything of the two women. Is he flattered by their attention and sexual interest, though his wife takes delight in being able to control and manipulate him to her will? And is she jealous of the one thing he has outside of her, his writng, and is that the motive that drives her to turn him into a creature she can wholly control?<br />Hemingway's best works were rooted in his own life experiences and, indeed, as he plumbed those, his well went regrettably dry in his later years, something he sensed and agonized over at the end. Yet this tale is fresh and alive in ways that many of his other later works were not. The one really regrettable thing about it was that he never finished it so there are still some rough parts, where his control slips and he says what he should be implying (by his own famous dictum) and the end tails off into an insipid and half-baked moment of insight leaving the reader feeling cheated.<br />Hemingway, had he focused on this one and finished it in his lifetime, would not have let it stand this way. But it's plain why he did not for this was not the man he wanted others to see. Still, this one is finely wrought and true, for the most part, to the old Hemingway &quot;voice&quot; and talent. I'm not sorry I finally broke down and read it.ims after another though he feels they will somehow unman him, allowing her to change him outwardly while losing himself in the satisfaction of his writing, the only thing, besides his wife, we are led to believe he really loves.

Like the hedgehog of legend, Jason Epstein in this book has one big idea: The Internet, he says, changes everything! All the rest of this book is commentary, memoir and historical anecdote recalled from a lifetime of experience in the hermetically sealed world of New York publishing.<br /><br />In fact, Mr. Epstein has written an interesting if only moderately useful book about the changes he has witnessed in the publishing arena, a book which, regrettably, does not offer much beyond an earlier essay he presented on-line about these same issues, although it is fleshed out here by the anecdotal descriptions of his personal experiences in the field. His basic thesis is that the publishing industry, by rights, ought to be a small scale business, but has grown, over time, into an unpromising corporate behemoth which cannot, in the end, sustain itself. However, the advent of the Internet should bring this chapter of the business to a resounding close, he suggests, as authors discover how to reach readers directly and, thereby, marginalize publishers.<br /><br />What, after all, do publishers do, he asks? They make books available to the public by investing in titles through a selection and editing process and then by financing the books' production (editing, layout/design, printing and binding), distribution (warehousing, linking with distributors and re-sellers) and promotion (advertising, networking with the review community and sales outreach to retailers). This is not very much, in the end, says Mr. Epstein, given the powers conferred upon authors through the Web.<br /><br />Thanks to modern e-publishing (on-line electronic publication and print-on-demand), authors can now do much of this themselves through on-line service providers at very minimal cost. The existence of on-line sales outlets such as amazon and bn.com (which have seen their share of book purchases grow from an early 1-2% to a more recently reported 6%) makes all this feasible since buyers cannot easily distinguish between self-published works which are well presented and their more commercially published cousins at the on-line sites. So, says Mr. Epstein, the business he has spent his life in is about to change radically . . . and for the better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his own book does not go much beyond this basic point, aside from the interesting life experiences in the publishing world he has to recount. And so I was somewhat disappointed by it. I came to it hoping to learn more about the publishing business and how to circumvent it, having been a rejected author for the better part of my professional life.<br /><br />(In the interests of full disclosure I should say, at this point, that I am one of those \\"empowered\\" authors Mr. Epstein seems to be alluding to who has found an alternative to the closed world of \\"big\\" publishing through the exigencies of the Internet. Unable to place my first novel with a bona fide commercial publisher, I went the POD -- print-on-demand -- route to generally good reviews. But I have found that this means of publishing falls well-short of expectations as I still lack the means to connect with the big-time review community, which seems to have a prejudice against the self-published, or to promote my book on a scale which the traditional publishing world can offer.)<br /><br />So I was looking for more in Epstein's book, hoping to learn something I did not already know and gain insight into how I might parlay my foray into on-line based self-publishing into something bigger. But Epstein doesn't deliver that. Instead he offers only a few insights and generalities about changes in the offing.<br /><br />And yet, perhaps that's the best one can do, as this is a new and growing field and none of us can really foretell the future, not even a man of Mr. Epstein's substantial experience. At the least, I think his basic insight is correct, that the Internet does indeed alter the present landscape dramatically. Still, as noted, I wasleft a trifle disappointed at the book's end (which came rather quickly, as it's a very short book). Aside from learning a bit about Epstein's own contributions to publishing past, and seeing reiterated in words my own experiences with on-line publishing, and learning that Epstein doesn't hold out much hope for outfits like amazon either (he proposes, instead, that amazon become a broker to publishers and authors, taking a small fee for linking readers with the books they want, through a publishers' consortium, each time a sale is rung up), he doesn't have much that is new to tell us.<br /><br />And, if I may be picky for a moment, I was a little put off by the editing/proofing of the book which I expected more from, given its professional provenance. I counted at least three typos (including two \\"thats\\", a common enough error, and the use of the word \\"identify\\" when \\"identity\\" was meant, among them). Worse Mr. Epstein got his reference to Albert Payson Terhune wrong! Terhune was famous for his books about collie dogs but he did not write any Lassie books, contrary to what Mr. Epstein reports. That was a fellow named Knight. Terhune wrote LAD, A DOG and numerous subsequent works based on the generations of Lad. A one-note theme, to be sure, but he kept me reading in my youth and was probably the first writer to inspire me to try my own luck in the publishing arena. Unfortunately, I did not have the same good luck as he did in finding a publishing outlet, until the advent of the Internet which, as Mr. Epstein suggests, may well, and hopefully will, change everything.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]e rather quickly, as it's a very short book).

I missed this one back in college, where I became enamoured of much more sophisticated writers (Joyce and Hemingway, though some here may question this characterization of Hemingway at least). Indeed, I had liked THE GREAT GATSBY back then but was not overly fond of the Fitzgerald opus of short stories so, on balance, I never felt motivated to read any further into his works. And yet I recently found a copy of this one so, having a little time on my hands, set out to read it. At first it was slow going and very dated in its feel. Hard to relate to the early twentieth century upper class snobbery which seems to suffuse the book and, indeed, Fitzgerald's very sensibility. Hard, too, to relate to a bunch of sophomoric college boys roaming the streets, arm in arm, singing silly little college songs and angling to outshine one another by securing a better reputation among their peers and better connections with the &quot;in groups.&quot; And yet, perhaps it was just a simpler time for, in truth, people are not entirely unlike that today though they are, I think, less transparent about it and more sophisticated in their areas of concern. Nevertheless, once past the first superficial ramblings of this book, I began to get sucked into the mind and world of Amory Blaine (presumably the alter ego of Fitzgerald himself). Although he remained a rather superficial and tiresome personality to the end, he was also an interesting soul and one whose travails, such as they were, could and did draw a reader in. I found Blaine's coming of age tale oddly enlightening, if only because I began to see the world as it was, roughly a hundred years ago, in a sharper, almost first-hand perspective. Blaine grows a bit though he never outgrows his essential self-absorption. But the loss of family and friends and lovers take their toll on his psyche and the Blaine we have at the end of the tale is a wiser and bigger boy than the one at the beginning. I think, in general, our serious writers in the twentieth century forgot about telling stories or creating worlds in favor of word-play and self-revelation and that this has done literature no service. Fitzgerald certainly was among those who took writing in that direction. But he sure could write and the fact that the very thin and sophomoric tale of Blaine's coming of age could hold me at the dawn of the twenty-first century is testimony to that. There are better and stronger books out there and some I much prefer. But the man could write. -- SWMe twentieth century forgot about telling stories or creating worlds in favor of word-play and self-revelation and that this has done literature no service.

One gets a real feel for the time and place in which these people passed their lives and of the cultural attitudes and values which might have driven them. This is the tale of the gradual awakening of the ancient royal house of Egypt to a \\"need\\" to confront the ruling Hyksos who have held power over the land, as the story opens, for the preceding 200 years.<br /><br />Sequenenra Tao, the scion of his ancient family, rules as governor in the provincial backwater territory of Weset in Upper Egypt. Although he is descended of a long line of ancient Egyptian kings, he is nevertheless subjected to numerous petty humiliations by his Hyksos overlord, the Pharaoh Apepa. When these grow to be too much for the proud Tao family, Sequenenra feels compelled to act. And yet there is treachery everywhere, and even within his own household, a treachery which will alter the course of events that the governor of Weset reluctantly sets in motion.<br /><br />This is a fine tale, indeed, and the last 60% of the book is, if not entirely compelling, certainly a very interesting read and will hold the intelligent reader through to the end. The tale promises more in subsequent volumes, too (it's  billed as a trilogy and I will be reading the next volume, given the quality of the first). The characters are also vividly drawn and an integral part of this tale which is more than one of mere battles and adventure. A good read and one I have no qualms in recommending . . . or in reading further myself!<br /><br />SWM[[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	2001-07-15

I first picked up and tried THE WINE DARK SEA, which is much later in the series. But I was a little put off by its very dry style and slow-moving pace. Still, I figured that with all the excitement about these books there must be more to them than I found in WINE. So I tried this one, MASTER AND COMMANDER, which is the first in the series and the beckoning portal for all Aubrey/Maturin fans.<br />Well, I found this one a bit better than WINE but, I must admit, I am still confused about all the fuss for these books. Here is a tale of two men who become friends aboard a small war ship in the shadow of the Napoleonic War. Neither individual is particularly vividly drawn though we do get a sense, albeit at some remove, of their very different personalities. We also see the very strained and formal aspects of interpersonal communications which O'Brian plainly saw as reflective of the tone of that day (though it is less clear to me that people were quite as stuffy and tightly drawn as he makes them out to be).<br />The events recounted are mainly episodic, too, amidst lots of \\"period\\" social gatherings and somewhat stuffy conversations. The characters are indeed interesting . . . to a point. But the tale, in the end, is just not structured tightly enough to suit me -- not a criticism in itself, to be sure, but a lack which, in my opinion, ought to be offset by something else: the strong interplay of personalities, powerfully wrought scenic backdrops, brilliantly soaring prose, a deep cultural tension, etc, etc. A good book can be good for many reasons and all or any of the foregoing can provide such reasons. Unfortunately, this book has none of these to offset its loosely structured narrative.<br />On the other hand, it does have a lot of nautical jargon, if you like that sort of thing, and a feel for the language of the period, though even this is rendered in a somewhat prosaic manner. And there are a few quite respectable battle scenes though these are not very clearly drawn either. In fact, there is very little sense here of the war at all. (Though this, alone, may be truest to the slower pacing of warfare on the high seas of that day.) In the end, this book, I suppose, gets its good name for the sense of authenticity it affords those who are fascinated by nineteenth century mores in war and peace and on the high seas.  ... I want to say at once that I have the utmost respect for the man, as an author who was plainly dedicated to his art. And I also imagine that there must be more to these books than I am seeing since so many readers can't be so utterly wrong. But, frankly, I have concluded that these books are just not for me and that, just possibly, and I say this with great hesitation as I am an author myself, the emperor, in this case, may be in need of a new tailor.<br />SWMiod, though even this is rendered in a somewhat prosaic manner.

Then the dashing Englishman, and royal look-alike, Rudolf Rassyndyll, played the king to save a life and a kingdom.<br />But, in so doing, he also won the love of the king's future wife. Now a Queen, the lovely Flavia cannot forego one final good-bye to her beloved Rudolf but this, through the machinations of the nefarious Rupert of Hentzau, promises to be her downfall. To rescue the name and honor of the woman he loves, Rudolf Rassyndyll sneaks back to Ruritania with the help of the comrades of his earlier adventure.<br />But this tale, though full of intrigue and marvelously paced, suffers from the fact that the narrator this time (unlike what was seen in The Prisoner of Zenda) is not privy to all of the action and so must recount and reconstruct as he goes along. So there is an odd distance from the fun this time out and the dashing hero, Rudolf, is seen only from afar. He is, in fact, something of a shadow player here and only slightly more real to us than the almost ghostly villain, Rupert of Hentzau, after whom this book is named. This Rupert, himself, was the henchman of Black Michael, who drove the plot in &quot;Zenda.&quot; Rupert fled at the end of that tale with Rudolf Rassyndyll and his colleague, Fritz Tarlenheim, in hot pursuit. Now the dashing and scheming Rupert returns to re-claim his property in Ruritania, which he means to do at the expense of the Queen who loves Rassyndyll. And so the plot is set in motion.<br />But Rassyndyll never comes fully to life this time around and the tale ends on a sad and tragic note. Rudolf is the noble hero par excellence, and no less noble are his many companions in the adventure. All are fine folk, torn by their sensitivities and loyalties. As a result there is something rather unreal about it all which detracts from the sense of satisfaction of the telling. But then it is a fairy tale of sorts, isn't it, one that is certainly well-paced and fun to read. Still, I wish Anthony Hope had fleshed his players out a bit more, especially the villains, as Rupert of Hentzau seems almost a non-entity this time out (he was so much more interesting in &quot;Zenda&quot;) and Rudolf a mere shadow of what he was before. Tarlenheim, the narrator this go-round, seems rather more of a bumbler than a doer and Sapt far less capable than before. Flavia, herself, is certainly more foolish. In sum, while this was a fun read, I think they'd all have been better off if Hope had stopped after Rudolf rescued the king from Zenda.er unreal about it all which detracts from the sense of satisfaction of the telling.

No gravitas to this one, but it's a tale of action and high spirits, beginnning with a young English nobleman who bears an uncanny resemblance (as he is soon to find out) to the new king of a small (and fictional) European kingdom, Ruritania, due to an indiscretion of a female ancestor. The indolent, if honorable, Rudolf Rassyndyll, younger brother of the English Lord of Burlesford, takes a vacation in Ruritania on a lark (and for lack of anything better to do) and is soon swept up in political intrigue, obliged to masquerade as the king in order to save that royal gentleman's life, no less than his kingdom. But Rassyndyll finds he is not at all averse to the role, especially when he falls in love with the king's intended, the beautiful Princess Flavia. Then he must contend with his own sense of honor, no less than with his look-alike's mortal enemies, to bring the king safely out of the castle of Zenda alive while yet preserving the king's own heritage, despite his inclinations to the contrary.<br />A good tale, fast moving and written in a manner which in no way impedes the &quot;read&quot;. I read it in a single sitting and enjoyed every page. Regretted it wasn't longer though. (Note that this tale is a sort of bridge between the older form of the 19th century historical romance, as practiced in Victorian England from Sir Walter Scott's time, and the more modern twentieth century political thriller. Lots of swashbuckling and derring-do and plenty of political intrigue as well. But, in the end, it's just an entertainment. You'll find no great depth here.)	2001-04-16

Along the way, the author, Karen Armstrong, offers us a glimpse of the parallel developments in the farther east where Buddhism and then Hinduism were arising out of a distinct, though perhaps not quite so different, pagan tradition. Nor does she scruple to look at the philosophical tradition evolving in the Greek world at around this same time as it progressed from a world view rooted in the concrete and the knowable to a system of inquiry fascinated with and focused on the metaphysical and the unknowable. All these strains, Ms. Armstrong asserts, went into the idea of God as it developed in the traditional western monotheistic religions and she takes her search right up through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and into our own modern times. Ms. Armstrong sees similarities throughout and ably articluates them, offering us a thorough analysis and then a synthesis of the God idea, in the process.<br />For Ms. Armstrong, God is an unknowable and yet a real paradox in that mankind inevitably longs to know &quot;him&quot;. The result is a spiralling of concepts over thousands of years with frequent circling back by various thinkers and the inevitable echoes of earlier ideas. Although she carefully disects the various God concepts she finds, in the end Ms. Armstrong is plainly an advocate for mysticism, with the understanding that God is not an objective being, merely greater than all other beings, but completely &quot;other&quot;, finally a subjective experience of the transcendental &quot;ground of being&quot; which lies beneath and behind all that is. For Ms. Armstrong God is not known through language in the way things of this world are known, but rather through a highly subjective experience akin to the way we experience art, where language and the rituals of religion serve as a kind of symbolism designed to invoke and evoke the experience of the absolute. In this sense, religions fail Ms. Armstrong and only the spiritual experience of the mystic survives and sustains. And yet she does not denounce religion but rather treats it with full respect and intellectual civility, deeming it as worthy of inquiry as any other field of human endeavor.<br />Where she differs from the straight religionists (those who believe in one dogma or another) is in her refusal to embrace any particular orthodoxy and her adamant insistence on offering intellectual sanctuary to them all. She is, however, rather hard on western Christianity, the tradition out of which she herself came, suggesting that it fell victim, early on in its history, to a naive confusion of the idea of God as a transcendent absolute (a numinous Being behind all beings) with God as a Supreme Being, first among all beings, &quot;himself&quot; knowable in human terms but infinitely greater than any mere human. She very convincingly shows the logical flaws inherent in this kind of thinking and takes western Christianity to task for losing the sense of mystery which Eastern Christianity managed to retain. She shows how the western world lost its sense of God's mystery for this mistake and how this opened the West up to a loss of the sense of the religious and a growth of atheism, the belief in the non-existence of God. But in the end she shows, as well, that true mysticism and true spirituality affirms God's non-existence no less than the atheist, for God cannot be subsumed under any concept, cannot be described or grasped, and is, in the end, no more than &quot;Nothing&quot; where this is defined not as the absence of something where something might be, but rather as the absence of anything since the true idea of God does not allow of any interpretation or discussion. In other words, this idea is not subject to any ordinary linguistic categories (a very Buddhist view, by the way) and so is not really anything at all since it cannot be spoken of. In the end what is it but just Nothing?<br />Hers is a mystical view finally, and many who are strongly attached to their faiths may find what she has to say somewhat offensive. Still she makes sense if you give her the chance and what she offers does little damage to the God idea, a concept which does not lend itself to easy explication, to say the least, but rather genuinely enhances it. I did have a bone or two to pick with her in that I thought her overview rather more superficial as she advanced into modern times and, after awhile, I started to feel that her personal view was perilously close to pure subjectivity which, in the end, must undermine the more substantial metaphysical insight she seems to be saying religion offers us. But this is tough stuff to talk about and I think she did an admirable job of it, all things considered.

Of course, we've heard about the vikings, coastal pirates and fighters who sprang from these folk, and about their wide-ranging adventures. Yet we are not nearly so familiar with the Norse literary tradition which chronicled the events of the viking world and which is, in some ways, as compelling and profound as the literature of the ancient Greeks we so revere today.<br /><br />Certainly the Norse saga tradition is as powerful, reflecting stories handed down orally for generations which were finally committed to written form in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Among these works, Njal's Saga may well be the best of the lot. Like all sagas it is a prose epic (as opposed to the poetic form of the Illiad and its kind), but still possessing a uniquely poetic rhythm and perspective which only the Norse folk had to offer. It is a somewhat bleak tale of several generations of Icelandic families whose men and women lived and feuded in the ninth through eleventh centuries on the remote island of Iceland, itself only settled by fleeing Norse farmers and land holders from about 860 AD onward. Here, in Njal's Saga, is a tale of hard men in a harsh land who push and pull at one another until the only recourse, in their grim pioneering culture, is the blood-feud. And, once unleashed, the blood-flow is literally unstoppable as noble and not so noble heroes cut one another down until, at last, one of the most respected of all the Icelanders is himself burned alive, with most of his kinsmen, in one of the retaliatory raids which arise from the ongoing feuds. This despite the realization on the part of the burners that what they are about to do will have grim and far reaching implications. Yet they cannot pull back, for honor's sake, and must suffer the consequences which they have wittingly unleashed as a vast well-spring of revenge and justice arises to overwhelm the burners. In the end it is the wronged viking Kari who single-mindedly pursues and hunts his foes to the far corners of the earth, affording them no peace as he seeks re-payment for loss of kin, until even he is spent.<br /><br />This, like most sagas, is a tale of many strands and several generations and so it partakes of the literary conventions of its type -- conventions which make it a little harder on the modern reader than some would like. There are extensive character genealogies (of little interest to most of us today) and very limited descriptive text (something else some of us may miss). There is also a decided lack of the subjective point of view or of interior monologue, i.e., we never get inside these characters' heads to see things as they see them. Indeed, as in Hemingway at his sharpest, we must 'see' the characters for what they are, based on what they do and say alone. The entire conceit of the sagas is that they are oral tales, reflecting only what people saw and remembered of the events recounted, and so they are written thus.<br /><br />But at their best, they are a keen, if slightly aged and clouded, lense through which we may observe the doings of real people who are driven, much as we are today, by the same need for fame and fortune which infects the human soul in every generation. Insofar as these tales, and Njal's Saga in particular, are windows into these matters they are universal in their unraveling of human motivations. And they are great adventure besides. Njal's Saga, especially, has it all including feuds and viking adventure and, in the end, a redeeming sense of human frailty and reconciliation . . . and justice in the eyes of heaven.<br /><br />If you like the sagas as much as I do, you may want to also try some of the modern novels which are based, in varying degrees, on this literary tradition. A few good ones include: THE GOLDEN WARRIOR by Hope Muntz (the best of the lot, I think); STYRBIORN THE STRONG by E. R. Eddison; ERIC BRIGHTEYES by H. Rider Haggard; THE GREENLANDERS by Jane Smiley; TWO RAVENS by Cecelia Holland, GUNNAR'S DAUGHTER by Sigrid Undset; and here's one I did: THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA (but you have to judge the merits of this one as it's not my place to offer an opinion).

And frankly I like swashbucklers, to boot, so that promised an added kick.<br /><br />Well, it read smoothly enough and yet it was a rather odd offering, all in all, since it proved to be a somewhat lyrical rendering of the life of the infamous pirate Henry Morgan, making him out to be an idealistic dreamer-knight, driven to do cruel and heartless things only because of his hard-to-outgrow boyishness, a condition which, in the end, entraps him in a never-never fantasy land of his own making. Certainly pirates weren't like this, all poets and romantics, not really, and it is very unlikely that Morgan, the rapacious scoundrel we know from history was.<br /><br />And yet, there is something endearing and entrancing in this magical interior fantasy of a boy who sets out to find adventure and grows into the rapscallion Morgan, scourge of the seas, of the Spaniards and, in the end, of his fellow buccaneers. This tale tracks Morgan from his run-away Welsh boyhood to inadvertent slavery in the Carribbean to young manhood in the English colony of Jamaica, and on to his long dreamed of career of piracy and beyond. Growing into a fearless and clever strategist of the seas, Morgan hurts those he passes by on his life's journey, from parents to father figure in old Jamaica, to the women he abandons, all because of his own self-absorption and personal dreams. But the lure of the rich Spanish colony in Panama, known as the Cup of Gold, and of a reputed woman of unexcelled loveliness who resides there, the Red Saint, combine to draw him on to his greatest adventure of all. There in Panama Morgan meets his dream's end, never to be quite the same thereafter. There Morgan will shed his boyish cloak of fantasy and, in doing so, seal his fate as an ordinary mortal like the rest of us, doomed to labor and grow old and die in the shadow of his shattered dreams.<br /><br />There is much that is surrealistic in this little novel although the portrayal of the time and place of the tale rings true enough, albeit as though seen through an oddly refracted psychological lense. The facts seem solid to, as Steinbeck describes many of the events of the time. But in the end, I found the dream-like quality of this tale less edifying than distracting and so, though it was an easy book to read, it did not completely win me.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]is shattered dreams.

Drawn to the Hamburg region of Germany as a young man, in the nineteen thirties, through the glamorous goings-on of a somewhat mysterious elder brother, the young Thurgo discovers a sense of comfort in the dark German countryside that he never found at home. Still he manages to stumble about and disgrace himself and lose what he most wants while there.<br />Back in England he tries to make a go of things before and during the years of conflict with Hitler but, when the war is finally won, he finds himself suddenly yanked away again, this time to a world of intrigue on the Mediterranean, courtesy of a dead relative. Smuggling, war-contraband and a case of mistaken identity suddenly give Thurgo a chance at a new life (and, perhaps, to revive what he had before the war) so off he goes to defeated Germany under an assumed identity where his pre-war facility with the German language enables him to pass himself off as a native. There he falls in with all sorts of reckless and feckless fellows, on the margins of cold-war politics, espionage and Hamburg's growing underworld, where he makes a place for himself, though it is never the one he thinks he has made. In the end he rises, more by accident than design, to be a kingpin in that underworld, though he is ever an outsider and a man who gets the signals wrong.<br />This is a tale of losing and finding and losing again, filtered through the clumsy and groping soul of a British expatriate who, for much of the tale, seems to forget he is English. But English he is and the homeland exerts a relentless tidal pull upon him at the end. This Thurgo is a sensitive soul, if lost and awkward in his dealings with others, as clumsy in his relationships with those around him, as he is physically: an overlarge and somewhat uncooordinated fellow whose imposing size stands him in good stead as lieutenant to a Hamburg gangster with a Nazi past. Thurgo, too, slides in and out of the Nazi shadow, abetted at times by unseen hands from home and in the British secret service in the occupied German territories.<br />From youth to aging underworld kingpin, Righard Thurgo conducts us on his magical mystery tour of a life which is as alien to him at the end as it was at the beginning. He is never clear why he gave up what he had for the German persona he adopted but in the end he cannot hold onto that either, or to any of those whose lives touched his. He is the lost ship which has slipped its moorings, wandering about on the open sea, wind-driven and storm tossed, a man of reflection in a body and world demanding action. And so he is a reluctant actor in that world, an always astute, if perversely unperceptive, observer of the activities around him. This is a big book and one which is filtered through the unreliable eyes of an unreliable spirit but it is rife with insight and recreates a world of new beginnings though these beginnings don't offer solace, in the end, to the soul which sought them.an overlarge and somewhat uncooordinated fellow whose imposing size stands him in good stead as lieutenant to a Hamburg gangster with a Nazi past.

US	51406912	R12ZZRWT7BNH0R	0140189785	70046812	Victory (Penguin Classics)	Books	3	5	7	N	N	A bit turgid but not without depth.	Unlike many here, I found this one to be overwritten and ponderous. The story was predictable and took rather too long to unfold. The characters, too, were less deep than I'd have liked and the tale, of a loner adrift in the Pacific Islands who is the object of rumour and jealousy and yet who blindly finds love, is not particularly fresh. For much of the time I was reading the book, I had in mind those old films from the thirties and forties with Bogart and Peter Lorre, et al. And yet, I suppose that is a compliment in itself since Conrad's work came first and set the tone which these films clearly set out to emulate thereafter. So cliche or no, the book, in its time, was fresher than it manifestly is now. Still, I found the slow and ponderous way Conrad &quot;grows&quot; his tale dated and less efficient than more modern narrative forms. And, in this case, the depth of the tale did not suffice to offset the lumbering explication. Allusions to Milton's Paradise Lost are clever but they are only that, not the tools needed to advance the tale. And the bad guys are clearly, as others have noted here, more symbolic than real. Heyst, the honourable loner, never comes clear to us, in his miserable isolation from others, and Lena, the fleeing maiden in distress, never grows into anything more. Yes, Conrad has a good name as an author, but not, I suspect, for this book.	2000-12-25

Although I detected slippages in tone, here and there, and felt the ending too contrived and overwrought to be pure saga, I was still swept along by this book, finishing it in a single sitting. It is short, yes, but also a very compelling narrative as it details the tribulations of two would-be lovers who are yet too proud and self-willed for their own good or for the society in which they find themselves. As with the typical viking hero, Viga-Ljot is overly confident of his own charms and impatient of results. And Vigdis, the maid he has set his heart on, is no less aloof and overbearing in her own way than that historical figure, Sigrid the Haughty, who so angered King Olaf Tryggvesson that he slapped her in the midst of their courtship and thereby sealed his doom. Viga-Ljot does much worse in this tale and his fate is thus forever bound up with a woman who cannot forget or forgive him. Like Gudrun Osvif's daughter in Laxdaela Saga, Vigdis bides her time and nurses her pain but, in the end, that pain is not assuaged by the actions she takes, for it is ultimately destructive to everyone it touches.<br /><br />A good example of the saga form in modern literature indeed, and yet, despite the finely tuned prose of this novel, capturing the nuances and understatement of the saga voice with masterly strokes, there is an underlying stridency here, an almost emotional overreaching which is not, itself, true to the saga form. In some ways this book is too modern and its author's sensibility, at this juncture in her career, almost too young and unseasoned. Undset seems to be reaching for the tragic denouement of the Greek classics to end her tautly told tale rather than content herself with the flatly understated and finely nuanced wrap-up more appropriate to the saga form. But this Greek-like ending left me much colder than the drily tossed-off afterthought of a true saga might have done. And yet, for all that, Undset has here given us one of the better modern novels done in saga form. My hat is off to her.<br /><br />By the way, for another really fine novel based on the old sagas, one, in fact, that I think outdoes even this one, try SAGA: A NOVEL OF MEDIEVAL ICELAND by contemporary Canadian author Jeff Janoda. Many have tried to evoke the sagas in modern prose but few have done it as well as he has. Janoda has written a contemporary novel that does genuine justice to its original source, Eyrbyggja Saga, while not succumbing to the overwrought sensibility which mars GUNNAR'S DAUGHTER at the end. If you like fiction grounded in the old Norse saga literature, then Janoda's book should be your very next stop.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801518 The King of Vinland's Saga]]der than the drily tossed-off afterthought of a true saga might have done.

From the title piece, \\"Eirik the Red's Saga\\", to his rendering of the Hrolf Kraki saga, these are all nicely wrought translations of some of the smaller gems in the old Norse literary tradition. Among my favorites are \\"The Vapnfjordmen\\" and the \\"Tale of Spike Helgi\\". These brilliantly demonstrate, in spare saga style, the way in which the best of these old Norse works capture and crystallize real people through an archaic and slightly clouded lense. But the images shining through are starkly real and resonate with our modern sensibility in a way which is surprising for such medieval fare. Of course, the title piece and the Hrolf Kraki piece which end the book go to the other extreme: the realm of legend and fantasy. Modern scholars tend to believe that the \\"Greenlanders' Saga\\" is an older and more reliable tale concerning the Norse excursions to Vinland than is the \\"Eirik's Saga\\" (this book's title piece) though \\"Eirik's Saga\\" is richer, by far, in literary motifs and more rife with fantastic elements, while yet being more literary overall than the plainer, sparer \\"Geenlanders' Saga\\" (which Jones did not choose to include here). And few will dispute that Hrolf Kraki's tale, this book's end-piece, is mainly one of myth and legend, albeit an exciting and well-told tale in its own right. In sum, Jones selected the most literary of the smaller sagas for this work, sandwiching in between two more legendary pieces, some more solidly realistic tales. But all with sufficient literary merit to warrant inclusion here. A nicely done collection for the saga aficionado![[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	2000-12-03
US	51406912	R1OS9D8TMY4N07	0140441832	26354692	King Harald's Saga: Harald Hardradi of Norway: From Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	29	30	N	N	An Exciting, if Spare, Tale of a Ruthless King	With all the adventure and action it presents, it's hard to fully grasp that this is no made-up tale (though it may contain some made-up elements), but rather a fairly down-to-earth recounting of the adventures of one of the last (some say THE last) true viking kings. Harald Hardrada (translated variously as \\"hard counsel\\" or \\"the ruthless\\") was certainly a pirate king par excellence.<br /><br />This saga is actually lifted out of the larger HEIMSKRINGLA (the Norse book of kings by Snorri Sturlasson). It records the flight and adventures of Harald Sigurdsson, brother of the deposed and slain King Olaf Haraldsson (known in Norwegian history as Olaf the Saint for his Christianizing ways but to his contemporaries as Olaf the Stout). Harald, a youth of 15 stands by his elder brother at Stiklstad, with a sword tied into his hands so he will not lose it in battle, but Olaf is finally brought down and Harald must flee with other survivors. Off they go across the Baltic to the country of the Slavs in what will some day be Russia and Harald makes his way down the sinuous river route from the viking stronghold of Holmgarth (which the Russians called Novgorod) to Kiev and then on to Constantinople where he wins a place in the Byzantine Emperor's Varangian Guard. (For unknown eytemological reasons, the Byzantines and nascent Russians called the people, whom we know as vikings in the west, Varangians.)<br /><br />In the land of the Byzantines Harald rises to prominence, being a man of great size (said to stand seven feet tall or thereabouts) and military accomplishments. He soon achieves captaincy of the Guard and the trust of the Byzantines, leading expedition after expedition against the Byzantines' enemies in the Mediterannean. He never loses a battle we are told and he spends a great deal of time besting the jealous Byzantine generals and officials. In the end he learns that his brother's son, Magnus, has been returned to his father's throne and Harald, after gaining much wealth for himself, quits Byzantium and passes again through the Russian lands to go home to Norway. There Harald persuades the young Magnus to share the throne with him and they become co-kings.<br /><br /> But Magnus doesn't live long and dies from sickness (?) only a couple of years after Harald's return, leaving Harald the lone king of the restored Norway. Harald thereupon enters into a lengthy feud with the viking king of Denmark, Swein Ulfsson, who also believes he has a claim on Norway through his ancestor Cnut the Great, the son of the Danish King Swein Forkbeard. Cnut had forged a North Sea empire uniting the Danes, the Norse and the Saxon English but his empire did not outlast him. Now both Harald and Swein Ulfsson have fantasies of restoring it with themselves at its head.<br /><br />But while Harald invariably wins every sea battle with the hapless Swein, he is unable to take Denmark because the population remains loyal to Swein. In the end, the call (and wealth) of England proves greater for Harald than Swein's wind-buffeted island kingdom of Denmark and he embarks on his final expedition to seize the English throne in the tradition of Swein Forkbeard and Cnut. This expedition is generally held by scholars to have been the final gasp of the viking world as it was the last full-scale viking expedition launched from the North that history records. But history had already moved on and Harald, supreme viking marauder that he was, is plainly relegated to the margins as Duke William Bastard of Normandy (another descendant of vikings, by the way), has his own dibs in.<br /><br />To see how this all played out, it's worth reading King Harald's Saga or, if you've a mind to go a little farther, a marvelous historical novel based on this three-way tug of war by the Canadian author Hope Muntz. It's called THE GOLDEN WARRIOR and there are few historical novels which have been done better. I'd also recommend the HEIMSKRINGLA itself, if you've an interest in the Northern thing. It contains many great sagas like this one of King Harald.<br /><br />By the way, there are a whole slew of good books out there for those into vikings and historical adventure, including a brand new one by Jeff Janoda called SAGA: A NOVEL OF MEDIEVAL ICELAND which details the events surrounding one of the most intriguing episodes in Eyrbyggja Saga (one of the most renowned of the original Norse sagas). It tells the story of a great feud between two chieftains over a little piece of forested land in an Iceland in which wood was as precious as gold. Other good ones include Cecelia Holland's very modern and psychological TWO RAVENS, a glimpse into the hot-house environment of an Icelandic farm, and Jane Smiley's THE GREENLANDERS which tells of the final days of the the Norse settlement in Greenland as the cold and Eskimos close in around the settlers. And if you still have any patience and want more, perhaps you'd want to try my own small effort, THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA, which I wrote to be the saga I'd always wished had been written and preserved about the Norse excursions to North America.<br /><br />All, I believe, are available in some form or another on-line.

I enjoyed the read and actually went over some parts of this book more than once. Certainly as a writer (and I imagine many of the readers of this book are writers or at least aspire to be), I was keenly interested in what such an accomplished storyteller as Stephen King had to say. But I must note that, in the end, I did not come away with all that much. Some good insights yes, and a feeling for the person that King is and for some of the events and experiences he believes shaped him, both personally and in terms of his craft. In fact, I found the author a likeable soul (surprising, given the stuff he usually writes about) but his pointers were spare and mostly common sense. I thought his most interesting insight was that you either got it or you don't. But that if you got it at a modest level, you can make a bit more of it. On the other hand if you ain't got it, forget it. I think I already knew that.<br />His other big thing was write less and more simply, don't pile on the words. A good rule, most of the time, though I personally believe that less is not always better. For me it's the rhythm and beat as much as the content of the words; these are inextricably bound in the effort to convey &quot;information&quot; which, in the end, is all that writing is.<br />Finally, he seems to suggest one should write from deep inside one's experience, letting it boil up and cook the tale . . . or whatever. Okay. Good thought and nice to know Mr. King, who is plainly an expert in his field, sees matters this way. To me it means he's the real thing, not a hack. But, on balance, it didn't add much to my knowledge of what it takes to write well. But I guess that was the point: you can't tell people what they need to know to write well. You either got it or you don't.<br />Still this was a decently done and enjoyable book for the window it provided, however briefly and idiosyncratically, into one very skilled modern writer's mind. I guess King is just one of those guys who can't turn it off. He loves to write, even about writing and about loving to write. Me too. A decent book and worth reading but it's not going to shake you up.turn it off. He loves to write, even about writing and about loving to write. Me too.

I found this book on a remaindered table; sometimes that's a good place to get interesting, little known books. Unfortunately, in this case, the reason it was on that table was more than abundantly clear to me as soon as I began reading it. It's a dud and I am at a loss to understand the good comments some other amazonians have vouchsafed it here. This is a tale of the dawn of civilization in the ancient Near East, describing a time when mankind first gathered in small city-like settlements in the Fertile Crescent area under the aegis of its gods. The central conceit is that the gods are somehow real, as though the way they are portrayed in the ancient cuneiform literature we have found in the archeaological remains, walking among and speaking to mankind, was the way it really was. In this case, the very old cities portrayed here (apparently pre-existing any of the later cities which are known to present day archeaologists) are each presumed to be the province of a special god and each god seems to be the product of the coalescing of aimless desert spirits or demons around human settlements in order to gain control of them. These cities are seen as the earliest sites of human civilization but also as fully in the thrall of these spirits who thrive on the humans they have captured. But one city's god has begun to grow lazy and, as such, its humans are beginning to grow away from this spirit. The tale is built entirely around this drawing away and what certain of the gods do to fight this. But it is absurdly told. A valiant effort is made by the author to effect the &quot;voice&quot; of the ancients as found in the old poetic texts, using a minimum of vocabulary and extensive repitition. But frankly this grows incredibly tiresome after the first 50 or so pages. And the story itself is utterly silly. The characters are flat and uninteresting. The gods have all these powers yet fail to notice the human's efforts to conceal things from them when they have only to reach inside the human's minds! We are never shown clearly why some of the gods are lazier than others (what is going on with them anyway? is a natural evolution taking place? an accident of fate?) or why, when they are manifestly interested in what their humans are doing, certain  of them fail to probe more deeply to find out the truth the humans are concealing from them. The tale finally just peters to an end. I was expecting a surprise, e.g., why does Engibil manifest himself as smaller than Enimhursag in the final battle and yet his city is so much more powerful and effective on the battle field? Could some new development have been at work in which Engibil was himself somehow in the loop? And why didn't he search where he should have known the item of his interest lay? And what was the special nature of this item anyway? And why would the gods of the mountains have done such a manifestly foolish thing in the first place, I mean what was in it for them? I hate writing negative reviews these days and yet this book could have been so much more. But it wasn't. And there you have it.nside the human's minds! We are never shown clearly why some of the gods are lazier than others (what is going on with them anyway? is a natural evolution taking place? an accident of fate?) or why, when they are manifestly interested in what their humans are doing, certain  of them fail to probe more deeply to find out the truth the humans are concealing from them. The tale finally just peters to an end. I was expecting a surprise, e.g., why does Engibil manifest himself as smaller than Enimhursag in the final battle and yet his city is so much more powerful and effective on the battle field? Could some new development have been at work in which Engibil was himself somehow in the loop? And why didn't he search where he should have known the item of his interest lay? And what was the special nature of this item anyway? And why would the gods of the mountains have done such a manifestly foolish thing in the first place, I mean what was in it for them? I hate writing negative reviews these days and yet this book could have been so much more. But it wasn't. And there you have it.	2000-11-07

Caesar comes brilliantly to life in this chronicle of his later career: his prosecution of the Gallic Wars leading up to his sweeping successes on the field of battle in the wake of civil conflict. All the personalities of the fascinating Romans of the day are sketched sharply here as counterpoint to the ever-brilliant Caesar as these busy, carping politicians and patricians maneuver around and outside Caesar's carefully honed sphere of  influence to unseat and defeat him. And yet they never stand a chance as we know from the outset. The novel is a little cool and abstract in some parts and some of the personalities seem oddly distant. Caesar, too, seems almost too perfect, little better than a finely carved marble bust. And yet we do get to view how the man might have thought and operated from inside his own head, a fascinating view to be sure. The most interesting character in this tale though was, I think, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey) who is tiresomely pompous and all too human  and never a match for Caesar, though he never sees that with sufficient clarity himself, until the end. Indeed, none of them seem a match for the Great Man, making one wonder whether Caesar really was so substantial a fellow or if he was just matched up against a bunch of dolts. Well, perhaps facing a man with such formidable skills inevitably makes dolts of all the rest of us. I had to wonder, though, how Rome managed to do anything significant with such incompetent leadership -- until Caesar came along that is. But in the end it was the very human Pompey who moved me as he rowed off into Egypt and history, a defeated general dreaming only of getting out of the way of the more than natural force his hubris had helped unleash.-- SWM  [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	2000-10-30
US	51406912	R3SP32I1WO3UNL	1853267856	627864010	Njal's Saga (Wordsworth Classics of World Literature)	Books	5	11	12	N	N	A Northern Illiad	Although most of us have heard of the Greek epics and, in particular, the  Illiad and Odyssey (the two most renowned epics in the western world), we  have far less familiarity with the literary tradition of the old Norse folk  who inhabited the lands about the Baltic and North Atlantic in early  medieval times. Of course, we've heard about the vikings, coastal pirates  and fighters who sprang from these folk, and about their wide-sailing  adventures. Yet we are not nearly so familiar with the Norse literary  tradition which is, in some ways, as compelling and profound as the  literature of the ancient Greeks we so revere today. Certainly the Norse  saga tradition is as powerful, reflecting stories handed down orally for  generations which were finally committed to written form in the twelfth and  thirteenth centuries. Among these works, Njal's Saga may well be the best  of the lot. Like all sagas it is a prose epic (as opposed to the poetic  form of the Illiad and its kind), but still possessing a uniquely poetic  rhythm and perspective which only the Norse folk had to offer. It is a  somewhat bleak tale of several generations of Icelandic families whose men  and women lived and feuded in the ninth through eleventh centuries on the  remote island of Iceland, itself only settled by fleeing Norse farmers and  land holders from about 860 AD onward. Here, in Njal's Saga, is a tale of  hard men in a harsh land who push and pull at one another until the only  recourse, in their grim pioneering culture, seems to be the blood-feud. And  once unleashed, the blood-flow is literally unstoppable as noble and not so  noble heroes cut one another down until, at last, one of the most respected  of all the Icelanders is himself burned alive, with most of his kinsmen, in  one of the retaliatory raids which arise from the ongoing feuds. This  despite the realization on the part of the burners that what they are about  to do will have grim and far reaching implications. Yet they cannot pull  back, for honor's sake, and must suffer the consequences which they have  wittingly unleashed as a vast well-spring of revenge and justice arises to  overwhelm the burners. In the end it is the wronged viking Kari who  single-mindedly pursues and hunts his foes to the far corners of the earth,  affording them no peace as he seeks re-payment for loss of kin until even  he is spent.<br /><br />This, like most sagas, is a tale of many strands and several  generations and so it partakes of the literary conventions of its type --  conventions which make it a little harder on the modern reader than some  would like. There are extensive character genealogies (of little interest  to most of us today) and very limited descriptive text (something else some  of us may miss). There is also a decided lack of the subjective point of  view or of interior monologue, i.e., we never get inside these characters'  heads to see things as they do. Indeed, as in Hemingway at his sharpest, we  must 'see' the characters for what they are, based on what they do and say  alone. The entire conceit of the sagas is that they are oral tales,  reflecting only what people saw and remembered of the events recounted, and  so they are written thus.<br /><br />But at their best, they are a keen, if slightly  aged and clouded, lense through which we may observe the doings of real  people who are driven, much as we are today, by the same need for fame and  fortune which infects the human soul in every generation. Insofar as these  tales, and Njal's Saga in particular, are windows into these matters they  are universal in their unraveling of human motivations. And they are great  adventure besides. Njal's Saga, especially, has it all including feuds and  viking adventure and, in the end, a redeeming sense of human frailty and  reconciliation and justice in the eyes of heaven.<br /><br />If you like the sagas  as much as I do, you may want to also try some of the modern novels which  are based, invarying degrees, on this literary tradition. A few good ones  include: THE GOLDEN WARRIOR by Hope Muntz (the best of the lot, I think); STYRBIORN THE STRONG by E. R. Eddison; ERIC BRIGHTEYES by H.

The author of numerous romance-adventures in the 19th century tradition,  Haggard turned his hand, at least once, to the older saga tradition of the  northern peoples. The result may well have been his best work. Skillfully  crafted, this tale proceeds at breakneck pace to unfold the saga-like  adventures of the stout Icelandic yeoman, Eric Thorgrimurs' son (surnamed  'Brighteyes' for his most notable trait), as he struggles to win the hand  of his beloved, Gudruda the Fair, despite the vigorous opposition of her  half-sister, Swanhild the Fatherless (who seeks Eric for her own). Caught  between these two beautiful women and faced with the need to overcome the  opposition of Gudruda's father, Asmund the Priest (not the Christian sort)  and his son, the greedy Bjorn (who would prefer to marry his sister off to  a wealthy chieftain in lieu of a liaison with the farmer's son Eric), our  hero must prove himself worthy of his destined bride while dodging the  snares of those who would unman him. Conspiring with her mysterious mother,  Groa the witchwife, Swanhild arranges to have Ospakar Blacktooth, a  northern chieftain from Swinefells, pay Asmund's household a visit in order  to see and woo Gudruda for himself. This Ospakar and Eric become immediate  foes for Ospakar is as ugly and vile as Eric is handsome and honorable. And  the tale only accelerates from here. From death-defying feats of derring-do  to duels between deadly foemen to treachery and mayhem in blinding  blizzards and on the high seas, this is an adventure which, once having  grabbed you, will not let you go. Written in an archaic prose, mirroring  the old nineteenth century translations of the original Icelandic sagas,  and intended to simulate the voice of the old sagas themselves, the power  of this narrative is compelling and unrelenting. And yet it is less  exhausting than exhilirating as it unfolds the tale of Eric and the two  women who loved him -- no matter what the cost. If the tale has a flaw at  all it is that the characters are not real in any sense of that word but  only larger-than-life actors who strut about upon the stage which Haggard  has drawn for us here. At the same time the sensibility offered is one of  pure and unmitigated adventure. But it's great fun and marvelous escapist  fare. A must for lovers of Norse and viking times.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801518 The King of Vinland's Saga]]t  all it is that the characters are not real in any sense of that word but  only larger-than-life actors who strut about upon the stage which Haggard  has drawn for us here.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but this book, by Sir Walter Scott, was the progenitor of what was to become a venerable tradition in English letters (and in other European literatures as well): the historical  romance. There have been many after IVANHOE, and frequently with a finer  eye to the period in which the tale is set (for IVANHOE contains quite a  number of anachronisms -- even Scott acknowledged it), but few have done it  quite as well as Scott. He uses an archaic English to give voice to his  characters, but one which is readily absorbed because of the speed &amp;  quality of the tale. So, though these people certainly wouldn't really have  spoken as he has them speaking, they yet sound as though they should have.  Peopled by many 'stock' characters and situations, this tale was fresh in  its time &amp; still reads well today -- a testament to Scott's skills as a  teller of tales and a sketcher of marvelously wrought characters. In this  tale of the 'disinherited knight' returning home to find the world he left  turned upside down, young Ivanhoe, after a stint with King Richard in the  Holy Land, must fight the enemies of his king and kinsmen anew. Yet the  hero is oddly sidelined for much of the tale as events swirl around him and  the brilliantly evoked villain, Sir Brian de Bois Gilbert, in the pay of  Prince John, struggles to win treasure and the beautiful Rebeccah, who yet  has eyes only for Ivanhoe, a knight she can never hope to win herself.  There's lots of action and coincidences galore here and Robin Hood makes  more than a cameo appearance, as does the noble Richard. In sum, this one's  great fun, a great tale, and the progenitor of a whole genre. All those  which came after owe their form to it. Worth the price and the read.	2000-07-14

For sheer narrative power and immersion in another world, few have done it better than Clavell in Shogun. The book grabs you from the first page and never seems to let go. It's an easy read, too, since you barely notice  you're reading. (I read it in three days back in the seventies, hardly  stopping for air, and have needed bifocals with reading lenses ever since.)  A tale of a shipwrecked English ship's pilot in 16th century Japan, this  book sweeps the reader through a murky world of political intrigue and  bloody violence as the English protagonist, Blackthorne, encounters an  alien culture and a world quite unlike any he had known before. Yet, for  all its rich evocation of the medieval Japanese nation, the book has some  unfortunate blunders including an allusion to a samurai using judo (not  invented until the 1880's, while this book takes place in the 16th century)  and another shaking off his sandals to kick at an enemy (quite out of  character for such warriors since they were predominantly weaponed soldiers  who would never choose to kick an enemy if they had access to one of their  traditional instruments of war as this one manifestly does . . . and  besides so-called karate kicking wasn't introduced into Japan, from  Okinawa, until the 1920's). The worst error, however, had Lord Toranaga,  Blackthorne's captor and mentor, playing chess, a western game, when it  would have made more sense for him to be playing the indigenous Japanese  game of go instead. But the Japanese warriors did have jiu-jitsu, the  forerunner of modern judo, and kicking could have been a part of what they  did (however unlikely) and Toronaga could have taught himself chess since  he is portrayed as a quick study with a keen and very deep mind. And  besides, these are minor quibbles. Basically, this is a powerful tale of  intrigue and maneuvering as the players move about on the chessboard of  feudal Japan, never certain who among them is really moving the pieces and  who is just being moved -- at least until the end. The sense and feel of  the culture, if not the details, also ring remarkably true and you do feel  as though you've lived the entire experience when at last you close the  book on the final page. The characters themselves are based on real people;  the events on things that really occurred -- though Clavell granted himself  literary license to manipulate and recast what he found in the histories to  make his tale a more dramatic one.

Suffice it to say, when I read it in my undergraduate days it was an eye-opener.<br />In his earlier Tractatus Logico  Philosophicus, Wittgenstein had sought to build a picture of the world by  exploring how language mirrors reality in order to capture it. In  Philosophical Investigations, a book which became the bible for a whole new  way of philosophical thinking (but which he never published in his  lifetime), Wittgenstein scrapped all that for the view that language  ultimately WAS the world because it contained it. A subtle but powerful  difference in the way one sees things. He achieved this not through a  traditional and long-drawn out philosophical argument but rather by a  series of pithy, note-like questions and answers to himself. The argument  does not so much build as unfold, as the reader sees more and more (from a  multiplicity of angles) the nature of language as Wittgenstein came to  conceive it in his later years. What it did for me back then was to wean me  away from a narrow and rigorous positivism, which had previously colored  everything I did and said, allowing me to see the value of many of the  &quot;non-concrete&quot; forms of life in which we find ourselves. It  doesn't answer the ethical or metaphysical questions of traditional  philosophy so much as it builds a &quot;world&quot; in which they seem  intelligible if one approaches them in the non-traditional, Wittgensteinian  way which is so crisply demonstrated here.<br />In this book, no less than in  his later teachings, Wittgenstein radically altered (dare one say  revolutionized?) the way we think about language and knowledge and even  thinking itself. And how we view the philosophical project. If, in the end,  we have not given up the struggle to solve philosophical problems in favor  of &quot;dissolving&quot; them, which he generally recommends here, it is  not because he did not offer us new insight into the matter but rather  because his strategy leads to a more open and broader view of the world in  which we find ourselves. Because of this book I found greater comfort in  the company of the great metaphsyicians and existentialists, for all the  fuzziness of their language (which Wittgenstein implicitly criticizes), and  learned to feel at ease with phenomenologists and even religionists (is  that a fair formulation for those who embrace the concept of deity in any  of its many variants?). And that, it seems to me, is what philosophy must  be about in the end, about the big questions, Ludwig Wittgenstein's  technical queries and explorations notwithstanding. But he gets you there  if you will give him the time and attention necessary to crack the world  open, like the opaque and rather hard-boiled egg it often seems to be.id not offer us new insight into the matter but rather  because his strategy leads to a more open and broader view of the world in  which we find ourselves.

And yet he was a writer with a secret past, a man of  irascible personality who shunned publicity though welcoming fame and the  honors bestowed on him in the end.<br />Mr. King has done justice to this tale  and this man, giving us some interesting insights into O'Brian and the  artistic process of writing itself. He tells the tale of a young man,  growing up in a troubled household, with a penchant for writing and a  markedly artistic temperament, who strikes out on his own, only to reinvent  himself early on, severing all ties to the family of his youth and even to  the wife and children of his early adult years. Hard to forgive, one would  think. And yet King's version is so compassionate and respectful that we do  forgive . . . in spite of the fact that Mr. O'Brian not only deserted his  dying child and first wife but remained cut off from his only son, no less  than his parents and brothers and sisters, for the remainder of his long  life, hurting these people by his cold dismissal of them in the  process.<br />And yet, you have to respect the man himself, a writer who  dedicated himself so much to his own vision, to his art. He was,  apparently, not a cruel man though he did cruel things. He sought only the  privacy and solitude required to do his work, a work which brought him  precious little in the way of material reward until the end but which  impelled him to substantial achievement regardless of tangible benefits  left unrealized.<br />King gives us a very good picture of the maturing man  who was O'Brian (both after he changed his name legally and before) as well  as a close-up view of the man's devotion to, and developing, artistic  skills. First and foremost, this O'Brian (who, enmeshed in his own  &quot;cover story&quot;, claimed to be Irish, but wasn't) was a craftsman.  Secondly he was a perfectionist who labored over his own work until he had  it just right. Finally he was a man with his own special vision who wrote,  in the end, a series of sea stories which would transcend their obvious  genre and finally bring him the recognition he did not achieve with his  more mainstream literary novels.<br />I must confess, however, that I am not  a fan of the sea stories . . . not yet at least. I am, at the moment,  laboring with the first one I picked up, THE WINE DARK SEA, selected, I  think, because it was the first book of his which I learned about some  years back in a New York Times book review (though it is smack in the  middle of the series) and because I found it, ( ) and perhaps because I was taken with the  Homeric allusion of the title. But, thus far, it has not grabbed me,  despite all the hullaballo about the series of which it is a part. It has  an oddly abstract quality which, despite all the detail O'Brian has imbued  his somewhat dense and sophisticated text with, somehow fails to convey the  immediacy of life on board the Surprise among the crewmen who inhabit it.  There is no real sense of the wind in the hair or the salt in the mouth  (though there is plenty of reference to these, among other facts of life at  sea). In the end, it's a tale told largely through the internal musings of  the main characters, the outside world viewed palely through this  &quot;lense&quot;, a tale of manners on an 18th century English vessel,  with lots of conversation and dinners and musical performances to wile away  the hours, but not much plot or action (besides its obvious lack of  immediacy of experience). So far, the characters have remained mysteriously  distant to me and the tale, while mildly interesting and even charming, is  decidedly not compelling. But, based on this biography by Mr. King, I  expect it will get better.<br />If it doesn't work in the end, I shall firstof all blame myself and go off to the first in the series and try to enter  this world which O'Brian has so famously rendered by that route instead.  Afterall, 50 million Frenchmen, give or take a few, and the American and  British reading publics besides (not to mention Mr. King, himself) can't be  entirely wrong.of all blame myself and go off to the first in the series and try to enter  this world which O'Brian has so famously rendered by that route instead.

A magnificent blend of science and  philosophical fiction, it's written in two parallel streams which recount,  alternately, what happened after and during the doomed expedition to the  distant planet of Rakhat, an expedition which grew from the near-miraculous  receipt of radio transmissions from that heretofore unsuspected alien  world. The basic motivation of the seekers is religious, as much as it is  scientific, and it is the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) which undertakes  the noble enterprise to reach out and make contact with the originators of  the fascinating transmissions received on Earth. The core group of  Jesuit-led explorers also contains a number of lay persons, all somehow  linked with one another, and with the Jesuits, through the person of Jesuit  Father Emilio Sandoz, a brilliant linguist and conflicted priest who is  both soul and inspiration to this group. What the explorers find on Rakhat,  however, is not at all what they expected and this shock, as much as  anything, is the cause of their ultimate failure with regard to the  &quot;first contact&quot; they have engineered. They are entirely  unprepared for the culture and intelligences they encounter and which lie  at the source of the transmissions which drew them, for  Rakhat turns out  to be a world which is like Earth and yet utterly alien to the ideals and  beliefs of those who have gone there; what happens to them shakes the faith  of those it does not destroy. And this is the crux of the tale as told by  Ms. Russell. It is compelling and thoughtful although, I must admit, a  trifle predictable. In addition, I thought the characterizations, while  sharply drawn (especially via the clever and thought-provoking dialogue Ms.  Russell places in her players' mouths), were ultimately thin and wearing  since the characters all seemed to speak and think the same way at their  respective cores. There was a tiresome sameness, a homogeneous liberalism,  which informed this novel and its characters and which, in the end, left me  with a feeling of artificiality, as though I was immersed in a college  campus among a number of aging academics somehow sequestered from the wider  world. The people at the heart of this tale are all so good and liberal and  politically correct that it hurts. One would think there are no other human  types in the world (except, of course, for those scheming and distant  capitalists who control the resources of society on this twenty-first  century Earth). Still, Ms. Russell, in her anti-capitalist, liberal  mind-set (I am assuming that the author shares the views of her characters,  based on how she has written the tale) has created a fascinating vision of  a twenty-first century Earth in which business (especially a dominant  Japanese entrepreneurial civilization -- and this especially seems dated,  given recent events) has triumphed over nation states. It is a world in  which international conglomerates mine the asteroid belt at the edge of the  solar system for the financial benefit of the enterprises which dominate  the planet and in which human beings become the ultimate source of  investment as ingenious entrepreneurs cull the battle-ravaged or  impoverished places of Earth to find and train intellectually endowed  children in exchange for twenty years of income from the work these  children are ultimately set to perform. It's a world of enlightened  indentured servitude, driven by the capitalist ethic. And this is the world  where our brilliantly idealistic little group finds solace in the good  works of service to the poor, while sharing dinners and scintillating  conversations with one another about the search and hope for redemption  through faith. The characters are clever and enjoyable company and the  fundamental problem which seems to draw them together is one which strikes  a real chord. And the expedition to Rakhat is intriguingly drawn as is the  world they find waiting for them. But in the end I was surprised at how  surprised they were at what they found. Perhaps it was their unremitting  idealism which blinded them. But it does seem they should have been better  prepared for an encounter with aliens and not been quite as credulous and  simple as they turn out to be, given the intelligence and sophistication  they are given by their author. Still the tale was a good one and worth  reading for the intellectual and spiritual puzzle it presents.oyable company and the  fundamental problem which seems to draw them together is one which strikes  a real chord.

But this  tale is not only about a life spent in training to perfect the art of  killing with a sharpened piece of steel. In the venerable Japanese  tradition, it is also about a man's search to conquer himself, to become a  better person. The Buddhist view cultivated by the Japanese warrior class  allowed for a spiritual dimension to their very bloody enterprise of  warfare and killing. And it is this aspect of his training that consumes  Musashi, to the detriment of the people he encounters and who seek to  attach themselves to him. Unable to settle down in the ordinary way, or to  simply join a particular clan as a retainer to some noble lord, Musashi  embarks on the life of a ronin (masterless samurai) as he wends his way  through the feudal world of medieval Japan in his seemingly endless search  for perfection. In the process he finds a young woman who loves him and  many enemies who seek his destruction, at least in part in repayment for  the damage he does them while on his quest. He also crosses swords with  many other experts in Japan's martial arts, but it is his early encounter  with a Buddhist priest that puts him on the path which will forever after  guide his life. Musashi ultimately finds his grail in a duel to the death  with a man called Kojiro, who will become his greatest opponent, a sword  master famous for his \\"swallow cut\\" -- a stroke so fast and  deadly that it can slice a swooping, looping bird out of the air in  mid-flight.

The antagoinst and, indeed,  the very antithesis of the blunt and often brutal Richard the Lionhearted,  that famed English Crusader, Saladin successfully pushed back the European  incursions on Palestinian shores and faced down Richard and his royal  cronies thereafter, concluding an honorable truce which allowed Richard to  go home to England without his tail hanging too obviously between his legs.  This is all told through the eyes of a medieval Jewish scribe, recruited by  Saladin to write his memoirs. In the process we hear about the sexual  dalliances of the harem and Saladin's court and get to see the Kurdish  Sultan in his medieval Muslim milieu, besieged by the machinations of the  lesser men who surround him. There is an odd abstractness to it all; this  tale's not very vivid and is sometimes nearly colorless in its narrative.  And there is no plot to speak of, merely the back and forth required to  tell us who Saladin was and what happens after our scribe joins him. Time  passes almost vaguely and we are absorbed in a series of anecdotal tales  and tales within tales, a la the Arabian Nights, so that, in the end, one  doesn't have a clear picture of all that may have been happening in this  time and place. And yet this is a worthy antidote for those who have been  surfeited with the heroism and glory of the European Crusades. The actual  record shows these Europeans to have been a brutal and benighted bunch,  largely put to shame by the nobility and wisdom of men like Saladin. And  this book, despite its flaws, does justice to that view. For a more  romanticized (but equally fair) picture of Saladin, told in far more ornate  and colorful prose, you may want to check out Sir Walter Scott's THE  TALISMAN, a tale of Saladin and Richard seen through early nineteenth  century literary lenses. A completely made-up story, but nicely told. Still  Mr. Ali's version is worth reading for its own sake. And to honor the  memory of a great leader who has been given less good press than he  deserved here in the West.[[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]romanticized (but equally fair) picture of Saladin, told in far more ornate  and colorful prose, you may want to check out Sir Walter Scott's THE  TALISMAN, a tale of Saladin and Richard seen through early nineteenth  century literary lenses.

Or at least what makes it serious fiction? A recent article in the New York Times extolled the virtues of the &quot;post-modern&quot; literary milieu in which authors allegedly meld the visceral with the experimental in order to re-combine the purely  intellectual approach of those deemed by Philip Rahv (of PARTISAN REVIEW  fame) to be literary &quot;pale-faces&quot; with the more earthy renderings  of those he called  the &quot;red-skins.&quot;  Story, as such, doesn't  count for much in this analysis. And yet this surely gives short shrift to  that aspect of fiction, leaving the telling of stories to the lower realm  of so-called commercial fiction. An error in my mind since I think that  stories, modernism or post-modernism be damned, are what fiction ought to  be about. But what constitutes a story? McMurtry is an author who has  repeatedly demonstrated his facility for telling tales though he has not  surrendered his place in serious literature for that. And yet this one,  COMMANCHE MOON, is no story in the ordinary sense at all. Nor is it  experimental in any post-modern sense either. And yet it succeeds because  it weaves a world of events for us which give us the feeling of being  there, that we have seen and felt what its characters have seen and felt  once we have turned the final page. Here is a tale of men surviving in a  world of unknowable and almost metaphysical violence, of men who are not  heroes in any formal sense of that word, men who are often clumsy,  thoughtless blunderers who &quot;make it through&quot; by a combination of  will and luck rather than heroic achievements. The last tale in the  LONESOME DOVE saga, this one may be the strangest yet as it takes the two  Texas Rangers, Gus MacCrae and Woodrow Call, through their formative years  and into their maturity. Theirs is an odyssey of survival as they set out  on numerous expeditions which mostly end in failure or partial success, at  best. Although they are apparently successful much of the time (we hear  about their capturing and hanging numerous thieves and brigands) it is not  their successful forays which interest McMurtry. Rather it is those events  which seem to characterize for him the futility of existence itself. Gus  and Call repeatedly bang their heads against the harsh west Texas ground as  they go after the Commanches (who are dwindling, though ever formidable, in  the face of the white onslaught) and the implacably evil Mexican bandit  Ahumado (a man, if we may call him that, whom even the Commanches fear, a  man who seems to have stepped out of our darkest nightmares). The heroism  here is not one of gunplay or gunfighters in bloody face-offs but of  survival, as men contend against an implacably unfriendly world, a world in  which all are beasts in an unremitting place where only the Law of the  Jungle prevails. It is Gus and Call's victory to have survived this world  and to have grown competent enough to endure it and, in the end, to have  outlasted it as the tides of new settlers sweep over the violent and bloody  west Texas plains and wash away the old ways and peoples. There is a  terrible violence here which may be McMurtry's vision of the world as it  is. And the heroism is nothing less than surviving the worst nightmares men  can conjure up for their fellows. Women are brutally raped and slaughtered;  men fare no better. All are subject to the vilest of tortures, some  literally being skinned alive -- all very distasteful in the end. And yet  it's also uplifting in a strange sort of way as our heroes outlast the dark  world they have somehow stumbled into. No, there is no story here in the  ordinary sense for this is a book of episodic and generally incomplete  missions and contests between men who in the end are barely more than  beasts (either because they are predatory or because they are reduced to  resisting the predations of others). And yet it is a book which absorbs us  and gives the senseof being there. In that sense it is certainly a tale.  And a level of fiction which I doubt the so-called post-modernists, with  all their experimental pretensions, are ever likely to achieve.of being there. In that sense it is certainly a tale.

In  truth, though the David we have from the bible is the fair-haired child of  the people of ancient Israel and their Lord, a careful reading of that tale  reveals a very different man: a man who cleverly turns every situation to  his advantage, who consistently says one thing but does another, who plays  both sides of every conflict and who collects women as he does kingdoms.  That we idolize this man today is a testimony to the spin his biblical  handlers put on his tale. And to the fact we will forgive certain folks  almost anything. In fact we seem to do that even today as recent political  events have shown, forgiving some men the greatest excesses while yet  condemning others for far less. I suppose it has to do with who we want to  like and who we don't. Well, India Edghill has given us that other David,  the one who lurks just below the surface for those of us willing to scrape  away the heroic gloss and read the old tale for what it is. Edghill's is  the story of David as seen through the eyes of Michal, the woman he made  queen of his kingdom, much against her will, the daughter of his  predecessor Saul, who David hounded out of his kingdom by cajolery and  trickery and then had the tale turned on its head so posterity would  remember David himself as the aggrieved party. It's not politically correct  in the religious sense but it's the real story lying there, just below the  surface. It's the story of David the soldier who betrayed his king and best  friend, who dickered with and served their enemies, who took Michal against  her will and installed her in his palace as a symbol of his right to rule  from a usurped throne, who killed most of the surviving male members of her  family and took one, a hopeless cripple, to live a prisoner at his court. A  man who kept his word when the appearance of that suited him but who found  ways to get around every obstacle his own words created when he needed to  do that. No, this is not the David we remember from bible class. But it is  the David which the biblical tales preserve. And Inda Edghill has dug him  out. Hers is the tale of David as seen through Michal's eyes, the daughter  of the usurped king, reluctant wife to a dazzling dissembler, watching as  the great hero of his people turns every event to his advantage and claims  divine support for each maneuver. The tale effectively evokes the  &quot;feel&quot; of biblical times and Ms. Edghill has a remarkable sense  of dialogue. Her words ring true and yet rarely sound too modern or  inconsistent with the language of the original material. I did, however,  miss a certain sense of the larger world around them but this was the  result, no doubt, of the female point of view Ms Edghill used since Michal  spends much of the story cooped up in one king's house or another, the lot  of royal women in those days. And I was a trifle disappointed by the rather  one-sided view of David which is offered. For all his clever self-interest,  the beauty of the original biblical story is how human David seems to be,  heroic yet manipulative, honorable yet not above self-interested violations  of honor. Yes, the biblical tale subsumes all the bad stuff beneath the  gloss of piety and good-heartedness and Ms. Edghill offers us a welcome  antidote to this based on the actual events themselves. But I think she  missed an opportunity to give us a more rounded picture of this man. If he  wasn't the fair-haired hero of purest spirit which the biblical writers  preserved for us, I suspect he also wasn't the totally unpleasant and false  charmer Ms. Edghill gives us either. Her tale is a fine one, a woman's eye  view of the Bill Clinton of his day. And yet I think she was not entirely  fair to her David in the end for if he was not all good, as the biblical  writers tried to make him out to be, he was probably not all bad either.  But Ms. Edghill's tale, welcome as it is, loses that dimension of the man  and gives us an image of a womanizing manipulator who gets good press  despite ill-doings. But this is a small quibble in the end, for she has  reimagined the David story in a way which resonates and enlarges the old  tales, creating a novel of real heart out of some very old P.R.

I came to this book after reading and immensely enjoying its sequel, A CAFE ON THE NILE. Since I like rip-roaring adventures in faraway places, and the sequel proved so enjoyable, I grabbed this one up as soon as I  found it in a used bookstore. And it was enjoyable, creating a world for me  which constantly drew me back each time I'd put the book down. Yet there  was something lacking in this tale of new settlers and broken souls cast up  on the shores of British East Africa (the future Kenya). Here were all the  characters who play such a significant role in the subsequent book and we  get to see how they found their way to become what we later encounter  there. The English gypsy boy, Anton Rider, lost and adrift in England will  find his moorings in the African bush -- a hunter and adventurer with a  touch of the farmer in him. The dwarf from Goa, Olivio Fonseca Alavedo, a  man who will gradually change from the cold-hearted schemer who cares for  nothing but himself to the cold-hearted schemer who also, by the way,  happens to care for a few friends. Gwenn Llywellen, wife of a broken World  War I soldier, will endure the wilds of the new country and the sadness of  loss while becoming a stronger person. Lord Penfold, hotel proprietor and  down and out English gentleman, will sink further into ineffectualness but  never, quite, inactivity. And the German ex-soldier, Ernst von Decken, will  demonstrate why he can be relied upon despite his cold and ruthless ways.  All of these are here in a tale of wandering and land-grabbing and lust in  colonial Africa. And yes, there's lots of lust. In fact the sex is rather  prominent in this tale, and frequently quite strange. Besides the usual  sort, we are treated to Olivio's kinkiness and a brutal rape. And Mr. Bull  has a thing for recurring motifs: The twin Somali courtesans here, the  \\"Black Tulips\\", vs. the sexually assertive and promiscuous  American twins in the sequel. Olivio bound and trapped in both books facing  imminent destruction through immolation. The loss of a beloved African  sidekick in both. I could go on. But suffice it to say that the sexuality  has an oddly abstract quality to it (it does not kindle and smolder in the  reader's mind as, I think, it should) while Mr. Bull seems to be fixated on  a number of recurring motifs and situations. Yet, this said, I must add  that while the book did not surprise as I'd hoped, the tale did not keep me  guessing, it once again kept me coming back and wanting more of the wild  world which Bull portrayed. For a big book, I thought the end rather rushed  and almost anti-climactic. And somewhat predictable. But it was an  experience to be reading it. (I put several others aside just to see it  through.) Perhaps if I'd read this one before its sequel I wouldn't have  been so disappointed.

Or at least they don't write and publish enough of them. Here is a tale of high adventure set in the wilds of Africa (from the rough and tumble city of Cairo, Egypt to the highlands  of Ethiopia) on the eve of World War II. Bull writes vividly about a  fascinating cast of characters caught up in events which are both world  shaking and personally significant to each of them. World War I is only  just behind these people and World War II is already looming on the  horizon. Fascist Italy has pretensions to empire in Africa and poison gas  is to be the key to it. All the while, the Goan dwarf, Olivio Fonseca  Alavedo, is poised to grow rich with his schemes to corner the cotton  market while his friends are struggling with the Depression-induced poverty  of the thirties.<br /><br />Into this shaken time come twin sisters from America,  paying for a safari to be conducted by Olivio's old friend, the hunter  Anton Rider out of Kenya, while Anton's lovely wife Gwenn, who has left him  to do something more significant with her life, and for her two sons, lives  nearby, the mistress of a clever Italian air force officer whose attentions  enable her to pursue her medical studies at the University of Cairo. An  elder, down-at-the-heels English gentleman rounds out Olivio's little  circle of close friends while the rough-edged German adventurer, Ernst von  Decker, shows up to draw Rider into his own schemes.<br /><br />Although the players  are mostly of the stock sort, they are engagingly drawn. I loved how Bull  portrays the \\"white hunter\\", Rider, as a  veritable fish out of  water in the mean streets of Cairo, stumbling awkwardly about and giving  his prospective clients second thoughts about him, yet a man who is  masterfully competent in his own milieu in the bush. And the Goan dwarf,  Olivio, is an especially intriguing (and oddly touching) personality in his  machinations to outlast and defeat his scheming enemies in the Cairene  bureaucracy while grappling with personal disabilities which would defeat  lesser souls.<br /><br /> And yet, there was something pro-forma about it all. One  of the inside blurbs called this book \\"a cup of CASABLANCA, a dollop  of Isak Dinesen, a pinch of INDIANA JONES and a touch of TENDER IS THE  NIGHT.\\" I think that's about right and that it makes for a very heady  brew if you like this sort of thing. As it happens, I do. There were,  however, a few problems since the tale did seem somewhat drawn out and not  nearly as compelling in the middle as at the end. And I was made a bit  uncomfortable by the constant shifts between locales and story lines as the  action was continuously deferred in one place to look in on alternating  players elsewhere as the tale progressed.<br /><br />My own preference is for a  story which pretty much carries you right through the main line of action.  But the varying streams were each interesting in their own way and, while  slowing up the read, did not finally halt it. I found myself more and more  anxious to see how the characters would work themselves out of their  various predicaments (though I never doubted for a moment that they would).  Although they were not the deepest of personalities and were plainly  stereotypes, they were nicely drawn for the most part (though I had some  problem with the lack of presence of Olivio's Kikuyu wife, Kina).<br /><br />There  is a bit of graphic sexuality and violence here but nothing that seemed out  of the way for this sort of book and the events it portrayed. However, I  thought Mr. Bull's credibility and authorial authority somewhat compromised  in the end when he consistently referred to crocodiles as amphibians rather  than the reptiles they are. At first I thought it an editorial slip but he  did it more than once which I found jarring (though not debilitating to the  tale which did seem to reflect a real feel for the terrain). I guess Mr.  Bull is just not strong in the sciences . .. or had a momentary lapse.  Yet, with all these caveats I have to pound the table for this book because  most of the time I wanted to keep going back despite all and, in the end, I  couldn't stop until I'd finished it. And when I had, it felt as though I'd  been there.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]ll these caveats I have to pound the table for this book because  most of the time I wanted to keep going back despite all and, in the end, I  couldn't stop until I'd finished it.

In fact I read the book many years earlier still and so I'm a little tentative about returning  here to review this book again. Can I do it justice after such a long  remove? Will I even remember enough to talk about it? Still, since it's one  of the great ones in the much-maligned (often deservedly so) fantasy genre,  I feel I must. Readers here will certainly have heard of J. R. R. Tolkien,  the father, if you will, of modern fantasy. And, presumably, those finding  this page will also know something of E. R. Eddison, the author of this  wonderful book. Suffice it to say that, in this book at least, Eddison  outshines the estimable Professor Tolkien, despite this book's clumsy  opening. Although he lacked Tolkien's comprehensive and detailed mind and  was certainly not the scholar, or perhaps even the craftsman, Tolkien was,  Eddison's WORM has a magnificent poetic sweep that even Tolkien's great  trilogy of magic and adventure and ancient worlds decidedly lacked. Here is  a tale of magical beings and high adventure set, oddly enough, on a  mystical version (vision?) of the planet Mercury to which we are spirited  in the form of an astral projection of one Lessingham, an adventurer and  dreamer, who is taken one night on a journey by a spiritual guide in the  form of a little bird. All very strange and distracting and, ultimately,  unimportant. For Lessingham soon fades into the background of the narrative  as the vision he sees on this strange world swells and surrounds and  overpowers him and the reader both. We are soon caught up in the sweep of a  tale that is a veritable medieval tapestry, never mind the awkward and  almost childish nomenclature which Eddison relies on. This is the story of  a Demon kingdom besieged by its enemies in Witchland and their evil ruler,  King Gorice XII, who conspire to overthrow and consume the heroic Demons  under the rule of heroic brothers and kinsmen. There is treachery and  mighty deeds to redeem the fallen and great battles and an ending which is  as surprising and strange as it is oddly satisfying. If Tolkien's trilogy  is an epic fairy tale writ large, this one is a veritable medieval saga of  heroic proportions. That it is ultimately magical and fantastic places it  squarely in the fantasy tradition which Tolkien gave credibility and new  life to. But Eddison came first (he wrote this tale in the mid-1920's I  believe), though he is still little heard of today. He deserves better as  does this book. (He's also the author of a straight historical novel which  deserves to be read, STRYBIORN THE STRONG, based on the old Icelandic saga  tradition which, to some degree, also influenced THE WORM. More, he did a  translation of one of the original sagas, EGIL'S SAGA, which is one of the  best of that literary tradition and among the best-known of the sagas --  though this translation is also hard to come by. For those here who are  interested in the saga as novel, I've also done one of my own, though I  doubt it is up to Eddison's STYRBIORN, though, of course, I certainly took  my best shot! It's called THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA and can be found right  here on amazon.com by searching its title.) -- SWMs  under the rule of heroic brothers and kinsmen.

US	51406912	R1BCBY2HUTC3YY	0020820445	266835193	With Fire and Sword	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Reassessed, this one's worth five stars!	I'd formerly reviewed this book and assigned it a mere four stars. But, truth be told, it has continued to resonate in my memory and so I think it only fair that I return and offer an upgraded assessment now. This is a  marvelous adventure, set in exotic (for us here in America, anyway)locales  and times, on the southern plains of what is today the Russian state, a  land which was once under the domain of the Polish nobility. Recounting the  progress of four warrior-types as they seek to carry a message into the  south from their Polish overlords, this novel takes us back to times of  strife and empire as the Cossacks awaken and rise up in the face of the  Polish nation which then dominated them. The Cossacks are portrayed with  much sympathy and understanding but, ultimately, this is a Polish tale and  the Polish warrior class (the \\"pans\\" or knights) are the heroes  of this epic. The message to be carried south by our heroes is finally  rendered futile in the face of the stirrings of the Cossacks and the four  adventurers must split up to make their separate ways in the face of the  great rebellion. The progress each man makes and the battles and  subterfuges he must engage in to save himself (and others dependent on him)  make up the subject matter of this tale -- along with the ultimately doomed  romantic stirrings of the Cossack hero Bohun who cannot have the Polish  girl he dreams of, though he is torn between his love for her and loyalty  to his own kind. There are chases and great battles here, along with  blood-stirring sword duels (the little swordsman, Michael, is a charmer and  certainly one of the least likely of heroes). And there is  manipulation of  men and armies on the great steppes of south Russia. All of this comes, at  last, to a thundering end in one vast siege of the Polish forces trapped in  the south by the Cossack rising.

I formerly rated this one at only four stars since it lacks \\"gravitas\\" and is basically a pure, escapist tale. I thought that made it too light for the heady draught of five star-ism. But on reflection I think I was too harsh. The book does have staying power in my memory. So here goes.<br /><br /> Surely a classic, this was Haggard's first foray into the literary field -- to prove he could do it better than some of his contemporaries. Having spent time in South Africa as a minor civil servant, he drew on his experiences of that land to impart a feel for the country in this short, but by no means small, tale of treasure hunting and adventure among unknown and exotic peoples. This is the story of an over the hill \\"white hunter\\" taken into the service of two English gentlemen seeking the brother of one of them, who had disappeared years before on the edge of a great desert in vain (or perhaps not so vain) pursuit of the fabled mines of King Solomon. Along the way they are joined by an enigmatic native guide who is much more than what he seems as they stumble across previously unexplored (at least by Europeans) tracts of Africa and into a lost nation related, apparently, to the Zulus of southern Africa whom the English of that day so feared and respected. Drawn at once into the internal politics of these people and overawing them w/their European technology, they are soon in deadly peril from the cruel king of that country and the evil sorceress who conspires behind his throne.<br /><br />But there's no use telling too much of a tale like this in a review -- the interested reader is urged to read it for him or herself. It's adventure in strange parts, for those with a taste to see how the great ones, like Haggard, did it.<br /><br />SWM<br />[[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	2000-01-30

True there's been an ongoing pulp tradition in genre  fiction reflecting the shoot-em ups of old, cowboys & Indians, and the  like, but the days of the big screen Westerns out of Hollywood, the Western  tv series on the little screen, the days when the Western informed our  American mythos, have seemed to slip inexorably behind us. Until Larry  McMurtry gave us LONESOME DOVE, that is. With this one big historical  novel, McMurtry merged the Westerns of old again with serious literature,  both historical and mainstream. Here is the story of two aging Texas  rangers in the days when the frontiers of Texas are fading fast before the  onslaught of civilization, caught, as in a time warp, in the sleepy border  town of Lonesome Dove. They are bored, aimless men, drinking too much or  working too much or just plain remembering (and trying to forget) too much.  Augustus MacCrae, the drinker cum gambler cum whore-crazy old adventurer  and his lifelong friend, ranger captain Woodrow Call, a man who drives  himself and others too hard by half, jointly run a shoe-string ranching  operation just outside of the little border town and both have gotten  themselves into something of a rut. For Call the ranch and its horses are  pretty much everything. For MacCrae they are barely anything at all. But  the two friends stay together like old lovers for want of anywhere else to  go or anything else to do. Until Call gets it into his head to make their  fortunes by a big cattle drive up to the newly opened coutry of Montana.  There things are still wild, he has heard, and the country still wide  enough and empty enough for the taking. Room enough for two old adventurers  who have had trouble adjusting to the world in Texas which their tough  rangering over the years has brought an unforeseen and, perhaps, unwelcome  peace. For, in fact, these men miss the old days, as folks do when they are  getting on and have seen their best years fall behind them. And so to  reclaim what they have lost, these two, or Call, more precisely, with Gus  MaCrae tagging along, engineer one last cattle drive to the new country in  the north. And thus begins an epic trek, equal to any of the great tales of  the past, in which these two gauntly heroic figures and their motley crew  of hangers-on undertake to reclaim the glorious past and to make a place  for themselves in the uncertain future. This is a tale of heroic  anti-heroes certainly, for Gus is a likeable enough cad who loves  adventuring more than the people his life touches and Call is a man who is  tragically out of touch with himself and those around him. Both have done  terrible harm to the people, and especially the women, whose paths have  crossed theirs over the years. And yet, these men are giant figures, men  who stride purposefully over those obstacles which chance and the ill-will  of others may throw in their way. The \\"road\\" north is fraught  with sudden, senseless violence, with clumsy judgements and human treachery  and yet neither Call nor Gus flinch from what they find, imposing their own  harsh, if fair, sense of justice on a wild and lawless land. This is an  American odyssey, a tale of searching and finding and losing, writ large  against the landscape of the vanishing American west, a fitting epic to  celebrate the strengths and tragic flaws which inform the American  character no less than the spirit which defines our very humanity. It is a  tale intended to shatter mythic stereotypes and yet one which succeeds in  making them fresh and real again. It is a tale of pain and hardship and  lost men and women who yet struggle valiantly to find and save themselves  in a harsh world not of their own making. It is a uniquely American tale  and a western in the grandest tradition. McMurtry deserves the accolades he  has received for this book.ng on and have seen their best years fall behind them.

In this  tale the two, as young men, stumble into the early Texas Rangers, drawn by  the naive love of adventure which rangering promises the two youths. But  they soon find that they and the rangers they lucklessly attach themselves  to are no match for the harsh country they confront. The Commanches and the  Apaches are harder and smarter in the ways of the wilds and the Mexicans  are more numerous and better prepared. The Texans are bunglers, led by  charlatans and self-interested adventurers. Worst of all, none of them,  from the lowliest ranger, to the officers, to the whores who trail along  behind them, know what they are letting themselves in for. It is a hellish  passage which they undertake, rife with the sudden violence and  grotesqueries which characterize McMurtry's vision of the west. There is  the oversized whore, Mattie, who alternately mothers and fornicates with  the young rangers she finds around her; the simpering easterner who has set  himself up as an officer in the rangers; the pirate turned soldier of  fortune who leads his troop of adventurers into country he neither  understands nor is prepared to encounter; the sudden lightning storms and  tornadoes; the misshapen Commanche war-chief who hunts the white men like  buffalo; the deadly Apache who culls the white herd in the night through a  long and arduous desert death march; the overly proud Mexican army officer  whose life, in the end, depends on the goodwill of his remaining captives;  the old mountain man and the scout who travels with him; the brain damaged  quarter master whose luck it is to live while other, more complete men must  die. All of these rush blindly toward that strange fate which awaits them  in the end and which will overwhelm those who will survive, in a moment of  surrealistic beauty and dread which somehow wipes away the harshness and  suffering which have gone before. In the end, MacCrae, the carefree  instinctive man of action, and Call, the careful and thoughtful planner,  are forced to see that they, as they have been, callow and inexperienced  youths, are no match for the country and the people they have found in it.  But, unlike most of their comrades, they miraculously survive their trek.  And are changed and enlarged by it. Country bumpkins and veritable  greenhorns at the outset, they are fast on the way to becoming the tough  rangers we will meet once more, in the books which tell of their subsequent  adventures, by the end of this tale. This one does not quite rise to the  resonant strains of its precursor LONESOME DOVE, but it is a fitting  prequel. We get to see how the country and the experiences of a harsh youth  began to form the two men whose tale this ultimately is. And if there is  not much plot here, there is a vividness in the description and the  dialogue that make you feel like you are there with these men. True, the  tale is so grotesque as to seem almost unreal. But McMurtry's writing is  sharp and evocative and fresh so that, despite a certain predictability in  the events, you want to stay with the characters, to experience this harsh  and nightmarish world along with them.

US	51406912	RWAS5F7OIM4L9	0899670431	259828480	Ivanhoe	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Nineteenth Century Historical Romance Par Excellence	Not to put too fine a point on it, but this nineteenth century novel by Sir Walter Scott, set in the medieval England of the Third Crusade, was the  progenitor of what was to become a venerable tradition in English letters  (and in other European literatures): the historical romance. There have  been many after IVANHOE, and frequently with a finer eye to the period in  which the tale is set (for IVANHOE contains quite a number of anachronisms  -- even Scott acknowledged it), but few have done it quite as well as  Scott. He uses an archaic English to give voice to his characters, but one  which is readily absorbed because of the speed and quality of the tale. So,  though these people certainly wouldn't really have spoken as he has them  speaking here, yet they sound as though they ought to have. Peopled by many  &quot;stock&quot; characters and situations, this tale was fresh in its  time &amp; still reads well today -- a testament to Scott's skills as a  teller of tales. This is the story of the disinherited knight, Sir Wifred  of Ivanhoe, newly returned to England from a stint with his liege lord,  King Richard the Lionhearted, crusading in the Holy Land. Sir Wilfred  arrives incognito because he has been disowned by his father, the wilfull  Saxon lord, Sir Cedric, for his obvious attraction to Sir Cedric's  beautiful ward, the lovely Rowena, last descendant of the royal house of  the Saxons and Sir Cedric's hope for restoring the throne of England to  Saxon hands. Too, Sir Wilfred had made common cause with the Norman Richard  who rules Saxon England in the wake of the Norman Conquest, which has  further enraged the head-strong Sir Cedric against him. But what the young  Saxon knight finds upon his return is more than he had bargained for.  Cedric and all his household are threatened by the nefarious machinations  of the scheming Prince John and his Norman hangers-on who seek to unseat  the absent Richard from his throne and place John upon it. But Cedric is  too hard-headed to see a difference between the two Norman factions (John  and Richard) and goes blithely toward his own downfall as John's minions,  the brilliantly evoked Sir Brian de Bois Gilbert and the greedy and blood  thirsty dullard, Sir Reginald Front de Boeuf, begin to work their plans on  Cedric, his followers and the guests which Sir Wilfred finds upon the eve  of his return to his father's house. Soon only the disguised Sir Wilfred  can intervene to save them all, yet he is wounded in a tourney and must be  hidden and nursed back to health by the lovely Jewess, Rebecca, whose  father, the Hebrew merchant Isaac and one of Sir Cedric's guests on the  night of Sir Wilfred's return (albeit one who is admitted to the feast hall  only grudgingly for the prejudices of the time), is threatened by the  greedy workings of Sir Reginald. And Sir Brian is soon smitten by Rebecca  himself, though she has eyes only for the recuperating Sir Wilfred. There's  lots of action and coincidences galore here, battles and sieges and bloody  duels to the death. And Sir Wilfred loves Rowena while Rebecca loves him  and Sir Brian, no slacker if aligned with the &quot;dark side&quot;, is  smitten, to his own detriment, by the lovely Jewess. Robin Hood makes a  more than cameo appearance here, as does the noble Richard. In sum, this  one's great fun, a great tale, and the progenitor of a whole genre. All  those which came after owe their form to it.

Under the watchful eyes of  the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a  Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at  greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward  the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's  judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the  hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment  inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons,  Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the  herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and  his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a  natural antagonism arises almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the  Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale  quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown  primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the  beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies  of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the  two girls. After a brief respite within the safety of William Henry  however, the tables are once again turned as Magua's perfidy puts the girls  once more at risk. And now the story shifts to a manic pursuit of the  fleeing Magua who means to carry off his human prey in order to finally  have his revenge on the girls' father, on the British and on the Europeans,  generally, whose presence in his native country he blames (not altogether  unjustifiably) for his myriad travails. Written in the fine tradition of  the 19th century romance (which, of course, is what this book is), Cooper  picked up where Sir Walter Scott (the venerable founder of this novelistic  tradition) left off, creating a rich historical tale of adventure, nobility  and marvelously sketched characters set against a brilliantly detailed  natural landscape. If his characters are less keenly drawn than Scott's  they are no less memorable for, in the quiet nobility of the scout Hawkeye  lies the strong, silent hero of the wilderness which has become the  archetypical protagonist in our own American westerns. And the Indians,  Chingachgook and Uncas, are the very prototypes of the noble savage, so  much used, and over-used, today. This is a tale of action first and  foremost without much plot but so well told that you barely notice, as our  heroes flee and pursue their enemies in turn -- until the very quickness of  the prose seems to mirror and embody the speed of the action. Nor is this  book only to be read for its rapid-fire rendition of flight and pursuit,  for it touches the reader on another level as well, as the bold young Uncas  moves out ahead of his comrades to place himself at risk for the others and  the woman he loves. Although we never see Uncas at anything but a distance  and never get to know the man he is supposed to be, he is yet a symbol of  that people of whom he is the last chiefly descendant, the Delaware  Mohicans. Nobly born into the finest of Mohican bloodlines, Uncas faces his  final trial with heroic energy and resolve in order to defeat the nefarious  and twisted Magua. Yet this struggle is also the final footnote in the  story of a people, marking the closing chapter for all those Indians who,  with the Mohicans, have, in Cooper's own words, seen the morning of their  nation and the inevitable nightfall which must follow. If you givethis  book a chance and bear with some of the heavy nineteenth century prose, it  will prove out in the end.

In fact, one might suggest that he invented the modern form of it (though, of course, there were writers of dime novel westerns before him, not to  mention James Fenimore Cooper and his leatherstocking tales). But Grey  certainly did something memorable and lasting with the form, if this book is  any measure. I had never read Grey before, so I picked this one up with  some uncertainty. Thought I could not count myself well-read until I'd  tried one of his books and this seemed to be the one with the most literary  weight. It's certainly named well enough. As it happens, I enjoyed the book  in the end, but have to admit that it is weak in a number of serious ways.<br /><br />Set in Mormon Utah in the late 1800's, it's the tale of a young Mormon  woman who is the sole heir of her father and owner of the substantial ranch  he has left her. Because of the significance of her ranch and because she  is a rather headstrong young woman, the Mormon elders feel it essential to  rein her in and get her married into the fold as quickly as they can. One  particular Mormon Elder, a man named Tull, has his eye on her especially,  with the support of his mysterious Bishop. But Jane, pious as she is,  demurs, recognizing that becoming one more of Tull's wives (in those days  the Mormons were still taking several wives) will only strip her of her  freedom and clout in the little community (which she has inherited along  with her father's extensive ranch).<br /><br />The story opens with Tull and his other  pious brethren about to administer a sound thrashing to a young cowhand  who has been working for the heroine, Jane Withersteen, and who Jane has  been flirting with. Jane is powerless to prevent the beating and worse until the appearance, out of the hazy, distant horizon, of a man called Lassiter. Lassiter proves to be a hard sort and a known gunman with a  special dislike for Mormons. His arrival proves salutary and the end of it is he stays on with Jane at the ranch while the cowhand heads out and the Mormons scatter, tails between their legs.<br /><br />Jane sets out to convince Lassiter that not all Mormons are bad while the Mormon elders conspire to bring Jane down by scaring off all her Mormon and non-Mormon ranch hands. Meanwhile, the erstwhile cowhand (his name escapes me) stumbles onto the secret hide-out of the rustlers who have been robbing the honest folk in  the area. There are lots of chases and hiding outs and some gun play. The cow hand finds his love in an unlikely place in the box canyon in which he  holes up (hard to believe this man and his intended are together an entire week, feel the way they do about each other and yet never touch one another, but it was a simpler time then, wasn't it?), the gunman hangs around Jane who exerts her feminine wiles to get him to give up his guns  before he can hurt anymore Mormons, and the Mormon elders continue their nefarious schemes to break Jane to the halter.<br /><br />Thoughout it all, Lassiter  seems oddly passive and inert for the deadly, single-minded gunman he is made out to be. One of the remarkable things about this book is the rich prose in which the landscape is surrealistically painted which gives it both its title and the feel that this is more than just a silly story about good guys and bad guys. And there's a strong sense of suppressed sexuality underlying the entire tale here as embodied in the highly visual rendering of the countryside, its canyons, its sage and its sky. The descriptiveness of the narrative is, however, somewhat repetitive and overdone as though apparently reflecting the turbulent emotions of the characters themselves, as though their innermost feelings are laid bare upon the landscape of their tale.<br /><br />The ending is a bit melodramatic too and rather predictable, but, in all, I can see why this tale has the good name it's got. It's intriguing and enthralling (it kept mereading through to the end -- a harder thing these days as my eyes are not what they used to be and I have less patience than I once did for the fictional word). But in comparison with many other works which I have read and enjoyed, I had to  conclude that this one is not quite in their league.<br /><br />Using the amazon \\"five star\\" system, I usually reserve five stars for the really good to the great, four for the pretty damned good to the good, and three to the \\"good but\\" category. This one is thus a \\"three\\" on that measure since it was strongly enough written to carry me as a reader and interesting enough in its unexpectedly powerful use of language but, in the end, that very usage went over the top and slid into the  dream-like purple of the sage in which the characters cavort.

Here, in this new tale, are the grotesques we have come to expect of  him, the suddenly violent eruptions, the sense of utter despair. And yet  the tale resonates, with its feeling of hopelessness, with all the aimless  wandering and low-down betrayals and the angry, incomprehensible bloodiness  of the Indians who understand the land better than the whites and yet are  doomed to lose it to the ever swelling numbers of them as they trek west to  encroach on the Indian lands. Neither side understands the other and so are  brought together in nothing less than a bloody war of attrition. The  harshness of the terrain in which they all travel imposes its bloody,  dehumanizing regimen on these people. This tale is, finally, one of  pointless wandering by men who seem to have nothing better to do. And,  indeed, perhaps they haven't. Even more, it is a tale of the savage  interplay between the peoples of this land as Indians brutalize whites and  Texans brutalize Mexicans who, in turn, brutalize the Texans, each yielding  to the baser impulses which the land elicits from them. There is not much  plot here either, just the love of adventure of two young frontier boys on  the way to becoming men which draws them into one foolhardy campaign after  another, leading them to participate in, and witness, some of the meanest  conditions living can offer, and some of the ugliest means of dying. It  doesn't quite make men of them, to be sure, but it hardens them and teaches  a bit about living in the harsh world in which they find themselves -- a  world which, through good luck and some basically sound personal traits,  they manage to survive in long enough to embrace.<br /><br />I am reluctant to  invoke LONESOME DOVE here, the tale which started all this but, in fact,  that is the obvious reason for this book, to show us how the two old Texas  Rangers, Call and MacCrae, got to be the way we found them in the latter  book. And yet it all works here without reference to that first book.

US	51406912	RH8L9VSPA8Y8B	0394402847	448449704	The Thirteenth Tribe	Books	3	166	204	N	N	Interesting thesis, highly popularized though!	Koestler wrote an intriguing, popularized account, in this book, of the theory that many of today's Jews (mostly those of Eastern European descent) are of non-Semitic origin. Essentially the book recounts the tale of the Khazars, a middle Asian Turkic tribe, or tribal group, which settled in the southern steppes of what is today's Russia, during the seventh and eighth centuries, and adopted Judaism (in reaction to the conflicting demands of nearby 'great powers' espousing Christianity and Islam).<br />In the process of telling this tale, Koestler concludes that the conversion of the Khazars, which seems to be historically documented, explains the significant presence of Jews in Eastern Europe at the end of the Middle Ages (since extant records do not show them arriving from the Mediterranean world, or even western Europe, in any great numbers in ancient or later times). This theory is a quite rational one though it poses problems for Orthodox Jewry since the premise of the faith depends so much (though not exclusively) on the historical link to Abraham, a Semite. Complicating the matter is the suspicion that the Khazar conversion may not have been a 'kosher' one. Orthodox Jews have not, accordingly, been quick to embrace the Khazar thesis and others tend to shy away from it for this and other reasons. However, the facts do seem to indicate that modern Jews are a mixture of many different genetic influences (just look at the physical evidence).<br />But if the Khazars did contribute substantially to the Jewish gene pool, they didn't do so exclusively as modern scientific research indicates that there are clear genetic markers which connect modern Jews (Orthodox and otherwise) to a single source which spans both the Eastern European and Sephardic Jewish heritages, suggesting that the Khazar influence was limited at best. But even if this research did not exist, so what? The record also suggests that there were Semitic Jews (from Constantinople and Persia) living among the Khazars before and after the conversion who certainly would have intermingled with a \\"Jewish\\" Khazar population in whose midst they lived. And no one knows what method the conversion may have taken in any case, whether rabbincally sanctioned at the outset or only after the fact, or not at all. Just as people from all pagan backgrounds quite legitimately enrolled in the Christian and Muslim folds from ancient times going forward, so there is no reason to deny the Judaism of Jews whose ancestors may have been non-Semites but who embraced the religion which traces its roots back to Abraham and Moses.<br />Now there are those who seize on the existence of the Khazars to deny modern Jews their claim to Jewishness. This is absurd, even if there is a substantial genetic link with a non-Semitic Turkic people in the Jewish past. Still others see the Khazars as a convenient hook on which to hang negative aspersions they wish to cast on modern Jews, suggesting that Jews are descended from a cruel and barbaric middle Asian horde, not fit to stand with the great civilizations and cultures of history. Jews, in this view, are not the ancient people of the covenant we find in the bible but rather historical imposters. But this is just as absurd as using the Khazar connection to deny modern Jews their link to their heritage. Like the Khazars, other European groups came from middle Asia at different historical times and intermixed with many different groups. If some adopted Christianity while others chose Judaism, there is yet no reason to suggest that the one group was better than the other. In fact the historical record shows that, while the Khazars were nomadic tribesmen in Byzantine times, they were no worse than the more 'civilized' Christian peoples of the Byzantine Empire in terms of their dealings with friends and enemies (and possibly they were better as they were a good deal more tolerant and less intrusive on their subjects' lives). Yes, the Khazar empire blew away without leaving a trace -- unless one seeks and finds that trace in the European mores and culture of the Jews coming out of that region (big fur hats and long coats, for instance, may have been a carry-over from the nomadic Khazar horsemen). However, the record, such as it is, also suggests that the Khazars were unusually enlightened 'conquerors' who treated their subject peoples with great mildness. In fact, this very mildness may have been the source of their downfall since they did not ruthlessly suppress their enemies or enforce any sort of cultural hegemony which might have created a unified state capable of withstanding the Russians who eventually overran them. Or the Pecheneg horsemen who were much more brutal and benighted. Or the Mongols, who came after, about whom little more need be said.<br />As to Koestler's book, it does present a very simplified version of all this, largely derived from the the work of the scholar, D. M. Dunlop of Columbia University who wrote a much better one (THE HISTORY OF THE JEWISH KHAZARS) some years before. Most of Koestler's information seems to have come from Dunlop's book though, in many cases, he over-simplified or simply got his facts wrong. So, if you're interested in the Khazar thesis I'd suggest you check out Dunlop's book first, although Koestler's is an easier read and adds to the case Koestler's own, not unreasonable, speculation about the relationship of the Khazars to modern Jewry (Dunlop doesn't go there). But as an easy introduction to this particular line of thinking, Koestler's book is alright. Just beware the oversimplifications and errors.<br />SWMthout leaving a trace -- unless one seeks and finds that trace in the European mores and culture of the Jews coming out of that region (big fur hats and long coats, for instance, may have been a carry-over from the nomadic Khazar horsemen).

This man is renowned in Mormon country as a  Mormon hater and killer and Jane finds she is strangely drawn to this oddly  heroic figure who saves her and her hired hand from the Mormons. These men  have come to enforce their will on her by driving off her non-Mormon  cowpokes and causing her to marry Elder Tull. But Jane is a convinced  Mormon and cannot believe ill of Tull and his cronies so she makes it her  business to persuade Lassiter to lay aside his guns and hatred of the  Mormons so that he will do them no more harm. In the meantime her hired  hand, Venters, freed by Lassiter's timely appearance, goes off into the  sage, to save himself, and there encounters the mysterious rustlers who  have been plaguing the local ranchers (and now Jane) and learns their  deadly secret.<br />Who Lassiter really is and why he hates the Mormons  gradually comes out as Jane works her wiles on him, but Tull and his boys,  and especially the local bishop, Dyer, only see that Jane is in  disobedience to the Church and their will by allowing Lassiter to stay on.  Accordingly they continue to press her via the community, causing all her  Mormon hands to leave her and all other awful things to occur.<br />RIDERS OF  THE PURPLE SAGE is a somewhat strange book and exceedingly harsh on the  Mormons (who may or may not have been, as portrayed rather convincingly  here, a closed and scheming &quot;cult&quot; in their earliest days) and it  is written in somewhat purplish prose (reminiscent of the sage it  persistently describes). There are long tiresome sections of descriptive  text about the weather and, repeatedly, about the sage and the rest of the  landscape which can be grating but which does have an hypnotic effect after  awhile.<br />The point of view, interestingly enough, is highly subjective as  we constantly see what the main characters are seeing, especially the  action as it is happening to them -- a very effective device as it creates  an illusion of immediacy and the sense that you are right there with the  people in the tale.<br />But there is not a great deal of action until the end  and the characters are rather thinly drawn, especially Jane who seems so  good and intelligent and yet, oddly, cannot see the darkness surrounding  her in her Mormon community. The cowpoke Venters is hard to get a fix on  and Lassiter, himself, seems overly passive and too good for the gunman he  is said to be for much of the tale. Lots of coincidences too, drive this  plot.<br />And yet, for all of this I liked the book. Though dragging here and  there, I wanted to finish it and, indeed, it ended well if a bit  melodramatically.<br />My copy had a foreword in it which notes the  narrative's repressed sexuality throughout and I think this is accurate.  It's hard to believe that two young people falling in love with one another  could find themselves trapped for weeks in a hidden canyon and never reach  out physically for the other. Maybe it was just the literary convention of  the time. But the narrative, the descriptions of the landscape and the sage  are all fraught with sexual energy and metaphor. But it is also this  suppressed tension and almost surreal sense of immediacy, this dreamlike  quality, which gives the tale its special power. Not particularly original  or even moving, it is yet engrossing and compelling.<br />I find I am willing  to finish fewer and fewer books these days as I grow impatient with their  authors. But this one held me to the end.

US	51406912	RZ2YDAAFAD0EE	0440201977	446299537	Assyrian	Books	3	6	12	N	N	Only of Middling Quality	Although this book is nicely written and quite readable (especially for those whose bent is toward historical fiction set in ancient days), it is, I fear, written with a very Hollywood sensibility. One can almost see the  spectacle of armies on the field of battle beneath the walls of Babylon,  the smoke and the fire and all the decadence of the Assyrian court up on  the Big Screen. Perhaps that is no indictment but an end to be sought. But  the tale did not rise above that particular vision I'm afraid and was of a  rather stock sort. It was also replete with all the harshly sadistic sexual  overtones we've come to expect from such Hollywood-type epics (as well as  from the biblical portrayal of these times and cultures). Well, perhaps  that was really how it was, who knows? But I was rather disappointed by the  lifelessness of many of the characters. On the other hand the tale was  nicely told and kept me reading. But the end was clearly a set-up  for a  sequel, one I declined to purchase and read. I'd had enough of the wronged  Assyrian prince, Tiglath, victim of the machinations of the harem, rightful  king but for the passion of one petulant woman-child and the coldly  calculating schemings of his half-brother/best friend's mother. What a  world. If this was how it was, then leave it to Hollywood. Hope Mr. Guild  gets a film out of it. Ought to be a hit.	1999-12-10

There  is a tradition in the Talmud that four great sages sought to go beyond the  realm of man's knowledge. One died. One went insane. One became a heretic.  And only the great Akiba came out of it whole, only to be tortured to death  by the Romans in the aftermath of the third abortive rebellion against the  Empire. Well, Elisha ben Abuyah, the central character of this tale, is the  one who became a heretic. He is recalled in the Talmud as a member of the  Rabbinate who forsook his faith and people for the Greek way, thereby  condemning himself, in life and memory, to excommunication and the label of  heretic. This tale attempts to visualize what might have driven such a man  and where it would have taken him in the end. The actions of the story are  really quite commonplace until one gets to the final Roman war against the  Jews in Palestine. But even these events are seen only from a distance. The  real crux of this tale is the seeking and the life-events which might have  underlay the tale of Elisha and help explain why he did what he did. His is  the tale of the child of a Hellenized father, wrested at his father's death  from the larger, intellectual Greek world and shoe-horned into a realm of  orthodoxy in keeping with the narrow prejudices of his deceased mother's  brother. His Greek learning aborted, Elisha becomes an enthusiastic student  of his people's traditions rising, in time, to membership in the revered  Sanhedrin. But the Greek seeds (or something else) have been planted and in  time take root, pushing out the superimposed shrubbery of orthodxy. And  Elisha begins to doubt and question. Unable to reconcile his restless  questioning to the blind teachings of orthodxy, he seeks wider knowledge,  causing a rift with the community of the orthodox. Driven into exile in  Antioch he begins a life of study and inquiry, trying always to use his  reason to erect an edifice in which he can wholeheartedly believe. But  events catch up with him even as his understanding increases. There is a  very fine rendering here of that process by which we try to understand the  underpinnings of the world in which we exist and one sees clearly the  metaphysical problems and Elisha's burden in grappling with them. He does  seem a bit simple at times and one can't help thinking that this, in some  sense, is the author's own tale, writ into a fable about a first century  Jew in the Roman world. But it's all very compelling and, at times,  riveting, especially as it captures the hellenistic world and its thought.  But it's a book of ideas, in the end, rather than people.

Although I'm a lover of historical fiction, especially the 19th century historical romances (read &quot;historical adventures&quot;), I'd never read this one. So I figured I had to finally attempt such a classic of the  genre. Well, it was enjoyable but not really first class, I'm sorry to say.  Not up there with IVANHOE or THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS (which, itself, is  somewhat flawed) or H. Rider Haggard's ERIC BRIGHTEYES, to name a few.  DUMAS' famous classic is a tale of a young country bumpkin of the lower  Gascon nobility come to the big city (Paris) to make his fortune (by  joining the king's elite guard, known as the Musketeers). He quickly  stumbles into trouble, even before reaching Paris, and never manages to get  clear of it again as one thing leads to another. He hooks up early on with  three Musketeers of the guard whom he inadvertently offends and then,  rather than dueling each to the death as they demand and he agrees to, he  ends up, purely by circumstance (and his naive loyalty to the king), on  their side. This all leads to further intrigue and mayhem including a  somewhat episodic adventure taking D'Artagnan (our hero) to England on the  Queen's urgent business, to foil the Cardinal who is the king's highest and  most relied-on minister, and the Queen's enemy at the same time. And the  king's sporting competitor in matters of state and the military to boot!  There is a sub-plot as well with a scheming and avaricious lady who  works  for the Cardinal and who has her own fish to fry, and lots of kidnappings  and sword fights in the mix. But the characters never really come to life.  D'Artagnan and his three friends in the Musketeers are cleverly written and  bigger than life but hardly full-blooded or anything but one-dimensional.  And D'Artagnan, himself, seems oddly simple and yet, inevitably is  described as the cleverest of the four companions who are all a good deal  older and more experienced than he is. More strange is D'Artagnan's skill  with the sword. From the first he is described as being awkward and  somewhat untutored, even in weaponry. Yet, from his initial crossing of  swords, he inevitably bests all comers, no matter how much more experienced  or skilled they are described as being. In fact, he seems to be the equal  of, or superior to, his three Musketeer companions, surpassing them in this  skill as he surpasses them in intelligence and cleverness. And yet he is an  utter dolt in his dealings with women, a veritable mooning adolescent in  the face of the the women he falls for. Nor do the women get treated  particularly well by the writer, for their part. I suppose it was the  convention of the times but they are all either beautiful and helpless  (downright simple, actually) or they are beautiful and deadly. But never do  they seem particularly real, from the Queen to Milady to D'Artagnan's objet  d'amour, to the lovely servant girl who hankers after D'Artagnan, nearly as  moon-eyed as he is about his fancied mistresses. All very strange indeed. I  suppose the book broke ground in its time and it is somewhat fun to read,  especially after the first third which takes rather a long time to set up  all the plot dynamics. But I must say I was frustrated no end by the  mindless meanderings and utterly frivolous actions of the four companions  as they proceed through their adventures. I mean why would trained soldiers  gamble away perfectly good, indeed outstanding, English mounts which they  had been gifted, knowing how dear these were and how necessary to men like  them? My favorite part of the tale, however, was the four friends' picnic  under the Huguenot guns so perhaps this was just in character for them. But  what characters! -- Stuart W. Mirskyh the sword.

This ambassador of the Caliph faithfully  recorded much of what he saw among the barbarians, including encounters  with the Oghuz Turks and the Norsemen who were then frequent travellers  along the rivers of what would one day become Russia. (In fact some  thinking has it that the Norse, in the guise of \\"Rus\\" --  eytemology unclear -- actually gave their name, along with their ruling  princes, to Russia since the first major Russian state, Kievan Rus, was  ruled by princes of viking heritage, with the help of second and third  generation viking adventurers serving them as mercenaries.) But Crichton's  book is not just a reprint of ibn Fadlan's manuscript (which is available,  in English, in various scholarly tomes). Crichton enlarged upon the tale he  found and appended an apparently fictional second half which takes ibn  Fadlan north, in the company of his new-found Norse comrades, to the viking  lands, there to face a shadowy menace of unknown origins. In this second  half, Crichton blended historical speculation with the Beowulf tale in Old  English (the chief of the viking crew which inducts ibn Fadlan is called  \\"Buliwyf\\") to suggest an ending to ibn Fadlan's adventures which  surely never happened. But it's done quite nicely, hard to tell where the  real tale ends and the author's fictional enterprise begins, and it keeps  you reading right to the final moments. It's not a particularly stirring  tale, rather dry in fact, but it's thought provoking and well-paced and a  wonderfully interesting way to do an historical novel. The movie (THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR) unfortunately struck me as a mite simplistic but it did a very nice job of putting viking flesh on the narrative's bones so I wasn't sorry I went to see it.<br /><br />By the way, there are a whole slew of good books out there for those  into vikings and historical adventure, including a brand new one by Jeff Janoda called SAGA: A NOVEL OF MEDIEVAL ICELAND which details the events surrounding an intriguing episode in Eyrbyggja Saga (one of the most renowned of the original Norse sagas). It tells the story of a great feud between two chieftains over a little piece of forested land in an Iceland in which wood had become as precious as gold. THE GOLDEN WARRIOR by Hope Muntz (about Harold and William and the struggle for the English throne in the mid-eleventh century) is another. Others worthy of your time include ERIC BRIGHTEYES by H.

Having heard so much about this saga-type novel I sought it eagerly & finally broke down & bought it via amazon uk (after a long & fruitless hunt stateside).  Rather expensive for this paperback w/lots of  typos & editing problems, I thought. But the book, I judge, was worth  it in the end. The tale of Orm Tostesson & \\"friends\\", this  book follows the adventures of this typical late tenth century viking  through nearly all the high-points of vikingdom in the period. From raids  & servitude on the coasts of Moorish Spain, to visits with Irish monks  and dinner with the Danish King, Harald Bluetooth, and his assorted guests,  including no less a worthy than Styrbiorn Olafsson, the Jomsviking and  claimant to the Swedish throne about whom E. R. Eddison wrote so  brilliantly in his own viking novel, [[ASIN:B000OP12HQ Styrbiorn the Strong]], this book takes  us through all the paces. Orm ends up with a very noble wife living in a  backwater part of Scandinavia (the borderlands between Sweden and medieval Denmark) but even there he gets no peace since his enemies and adventures pursue him. And in his maturity another and final adventure comes his way when he is summoned to the eastern reaches of  far Gaardarike (the country  that was to become Russia) to claim an  \\"inheritance\\" of great  value. Along the way, Orm makes some good friends, some bad enemies,  participates in some (but by no means all) of the great events of viking history in that period, and finally mellows to become a better man who embraces the new way of thinking while yet feeling at home in the old.<br /><br />I  did think the book a bit too episodic though this is no indictment of it since the sagas themselves are nearly always such and the \\"voice\\"  smacks very much of the sagaman's art. However, a close reading makes this very clearly a modern novel for the humor is quite bracing and alone marks this tale out as one of ours and not one from an earlier time. I especially  appreciated Orm's hypochondria, despite his courage in the face of battle, a very human and humorous touch! And the fighting is all very realistic, no great superhuman  feats of derring do (except occasionally as we find in the real sagas). Some of the literary technniques used, besides the  marvelous sense of tongue-in-cheek humor, are also quite contemporary. I  did think the tale a bit slow in places, especially at the beginning, and rather more predictable than not.<br /><br />And, more, it is not, in my opinion the  best of the viking or saga novels despite what others have said here. For  tautness and action, none have yet done it better, in my  opinion, than H.  Rider Haggard with [[ASIN:1421906198 Eric Brighteyes]]. For the pure poetry of style, Eddison's  STYRBIORN THE STRONG still has my vote. And for the resounding greatness of  the tale and the power to move, no modern author has ever penned a better  saga novel than Hope Muntz did with [[ASIN:B000K3UOZI The Golden Warrior]]. But Bengtsson did a  very nice job and deserves five stars for it. I take my hat off to him and to those here whose reviews obliged me to obtain and read this fine viking  tale.<br /><br />(For those with an interest in the saga as novel, a few other good  ones I'd recommend include Cecelia Holland's very modern and psychological  [[ASIN:0575023708 Two Ravens]], a glimpse into the hot-house environment of  an Icelandic farm,  and Jane Smiley's [[ASIN:1400095468 The Greenlanders]] which tells of the final days of the the Norse settlement in Greenland as the cold and the Eskimos closed in around  the settlers there. And if you still have any patience and want more, perhaps  you'd want to try my own small effort, THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA, which I  wrote to be the saga I'd always wished had been written and preserved about  the Norse excursions to this part of the world.

Still, Hope Muntz' tale of Harold and William and their epic tug-of-war for the throne of England which ended in the bloody Battle of Hastings in 1066 is worth writing about again (though I haven't the patience or energy to attempt to recap the full text of that now lost review).<br /><br />I'm  a lover of historical fiction and have never found any book in that vein  better than this one. Written in a terse saga-style which evokes the  original time and place of the events recounted, THE GOLDEN WARRIOR offers  a time-warp experience which puts us directly in the medieval world on the  eve of the final fall of the last of the English kings. Some have found the  style of the text a bit off-putting and distant in its early stage but I  have never found anyone who, once reading beyond the cool, objective saga  like beginning, has failed to admire the book at the end. If there are  failings, and there are, they revolve around Muntz' portrayal of Harold,  Earl of Wessex and later King of the English, as a man who is almost too  good, too perfect to be believed. And yet he is vividly brought to life  here along with an entire cast of brilliantly rendered folk including his  beloved common-law wife, Edith Swan Neck, and his relentless rival and,  finally, foe, William of Normandy. In fact it is William who seems more  fully shaped, though Harold, in the end, is the one we cry for. And we do,  or at least I did, finding tears on my cheeks when I came to the final  battle . . . and this more than once. There are not many books, I think,  which can do this but here is one which does it over and over again.<br /><br />For  those who love historical fiction, especially set in medieval England, and  for those who admire the old sagas or tales of vikings and such, this book  is to be sought and treasured. But it is less an adventure than a tale of  real people in serious times. The tale of the fall of Harold has never been  better told in my opinion than in this veritable English Iliad and I  cannot urge it strongly enough.<br /><br />But if you've already read it or if you have no luck in finding it, you might try another which, while not quite as  good (I regret to admit) may also be of interest to readers of this one.

The Anglo-Saxons, of  course, are the Germanic folk antecedents of the later English who formed  the bulk (if not the totality) of the modern British nation. And real  English history begins with them, their exploits and kingships in the dark  ages attending the Roman decline in the west. Their Chronicles record their  first entry to the Island of Britain as well as the ebbs and flows of their  victories as they gradually expanded and came to supplant the Romanized  Celts (the Britons) who were their predecesors.<br /><br />In later time, these  Anglo-Saxons, these English came to recount the legends of their Island's  past and among these legends was that of a British king who stood against  invaders for a time to unite the fractious British in a single, glorious  kingdom. Of course, this was the legendary King Arthur and among his foes  (though not alone among them) were the Germanic tribes, their ancestors.  Arthur's tales were retold and recorded among the Celtic people who  remained in western Britain (Wales) as well as among the Celts of Brittany  (along the rugged coast of today's France where many exiled Britons fled  and settled). And from these two locales these tales entered the medieval  lexicon and opus, via the French jongleurs and the Welsh, and later  English, clerics.<br /><br />The tales took many forms and \\"grew\\" a  variety of characters and episodes, coming in time to incorporate a complex  set of legends, sometimes more Welsh folktale, sometimes more naive  history, sometimes anachronistic medieval adventures. But what they all had  in common was the representation of a man (not clearly known to the  historical record) who stood up to the tide of history for a time and  established a royal court which later generations would look back on with  wonder.<br /><br />In the modern world, this cycle has spawned many retellings,  including those which emphasize the magical elements and those which harp  on the historical. But none, to my knowledge, ever focused on how this king  and his following would have looked to the Germanic tribesmen who came, in  time, to inherit his homeland and his mantle. None, that is, until this  book. Diana Paxson's tale, in this volume, is the one of Arthur (Artor,  here) as seen not through Roman or British eyes, but as his erstwhile  enemies might have perceived him. It is the story from the Saxon point of  view. Oesc, the son of Octha the son of Hengest (that historical Saxon  mercenary who rebelled, according to the histories, against Arthur's  predecessor British rulers and who claimed land in Britain for his own), is  the central character here as he grows from frightened boy in the old Saxon  lands, awash with the encroaching sea, into a young man, first as part of a  new Jutish colony on the British coast and then as war-hostage at Arthur's  court.<br /><br />Oesc finds a soul mate of sorts in the noble young Artor and this  tale recounts his growth and coming of age in a time when men's lives were  short for the strife and rough living they must endure. It is more Oesc's  tale than Artor's, as it should be, and it vividly recaptures the sense of  the earliest Saxon inhabitants of the Island of Britain. One can see the  Germanic folk of the Old Chronicles sharply here, both as they struggle on  the fast eroding shores of their old, inhospitable homeland and as they  strive to re-root themselves in the land which was to belong to their  descendants. Here in America we sometimes forget that other people also  colonized their lands in the past (that's how all nations got founded  afterall, and most found others to displace -- a somewhat distasteful  remembrance, given the harsh realities attendant on that).Britain,  England, is no different in that sense from America. And so Oesc grows up  to lead his folk, one of the Saxon tribes, in their ongoing struggle with  the indigenous British.<br /><br />In Arthur's time the Saxons were successful to  the extent that they secured a permanent foothold on the British lands  (though you can't always tell this from the tone and content of the old  British tales) but Arthur, if he indeed lived, or his more historical  compatriots, contained the Saxons through a number of historically  remembered victories. But the Saxon tide in the land was inexorable and the  Germanic folk gradually shoved their way across the island, squeezing the  British into their mountain fastnesses or into the peninsula of Cornwall,  or north into Scotland, or overseas to Ireland or Britanny. They took their  tales with them, these exiled Celts, hence the Arthurian cycle, reclaimed  in later days by the latter day English.<br /><br />But Paxson goes the medieval  English one better, turning the tale into a part of the Anglo-Saxon  expansion as recorded in the Chronicles which remember the early Germanic  heroes and war-leaders who gave way, in time, to the English kings, who  were themselves finally overthrown by their Danish and Norse kinsmen --  and, still later, and with more finality, by the Norman French (who were  themselves of Norse, therefore, Germanic, descent). If I have a quibble or  two with Paxson it's that her tale seems too brief with not much in the way  of plot structure or depth of characterization, especially of the British.  Artor seems as he always does, bigger than life, noble and heroic, but  barely there, while his companions seem to be little more than names. This,  of course, is the tale of Oesc and his kind who are more vividly drawn and  here the Germanic flavor is fully realized. Yet I'd have preferred to see  more of the strains between the two sides, more pushing and pulling if you  will. But the end is deeply moving as we see the hero fulfill a destiny  which only those close to their roots and the seemingly spiritual forces of  their heritage can embrace without deep regret. And yet we regret the loss,  the waste which this forces upon our consciousness although it is plain  that this path is the one we all trod, wasteful or not, in the end. --  Stuart W.

This is the fourth time I've attempted to place a review of this book on-line. Well maybe the fourth is the charm.<br /><br />This tale's a sweeping adventure about English (and other) pirates in the Indian Ocean and South  Atlantic along the southern African coastline during the days of  English-Dutch colonial conflict in the 17th century. The first quarter of  the book, unfortunately, is tiresome as it's rife w/cliches: the noble Sir  Francis Courtney (\\"pirate\\" captain and knight of the order of  something or other), his eager and bright-eyed young son Hal, the African  sidekick and all around noble savage, Aboli, and, of course, all the de  rigeuer bad guys (the lovely and sexually sadistic Katrina, her fat  malevolent husband, the Dutch governor, the treacherous first mate, the  evil pirate captain and comrade, etc.). But, oddly enough, the tale does  catch fire once the characters get mixed up with one another and end up in Cape Town. Although the plot is mechanical and the characters little more than cardboard cut-outs, the writing (including sharp descriptions of the  African flora and fauna, life aboard ship and lots of taut action) does  have a certain zing to it. I did find the evil and thick headed Dutch colonel (in the service of the fat governor) somewhat annoying (though he  was the \\"perfect\\" villain w/his shaved pate and waxed moustachios -- shades of Simon LeGree!) and I thought the torturer, Slow John, another  bit of overkill, if you'll pardon the \\"sort-of-pun.\\"  But Smith  can write action scenes -- when he's not larding the plot with villains and  nefarious encounters, along with one cliche after another (lots of duels to the death, ambushes, daring escapes, fierce sea battles, etc.). His female  love interests are also so perfect and so wooden you'll think them puppets. (I can't remember the names or very much else about the two lovely gals who give up everything for the dashing young Hal except that each is lovelier  than all other fair maids in the world and, of course, loyal and self-sacrificing to the core.) In fact there's too much here generally. One  action scene after another drives this plot. Reminded me of the worst of  television. But, oddly, and I have to admit this here, it kept me reading. Aside from the nicely turned phrases and descriptions of the terrain and the action, or perhaps because of this, the book does hold the reader to it. So what if the characters are barely real? The prose is peppy (after the early parts, I must hasten to add) so, in sum, I think I can see why Smith manages to make a living at this stuff. But it doesn't hold a candle  to the great pirate literature of the past (am thinking of Sabatini's Captain Blood here, or Stevenson's Treasure Island). On the other hand, the gratuitous sex and mayhem perhaps speaks more to our modern sensibilities. I was a little troubled by the double climax which seemed to throw away a  wonderful confrontation between hero and villain at the end . . . after the  book had, to all intents and purposes, already come to a crashing and fiery halt. But I guess Smith just figured he had to get that one last duel into  the mix. And couldn't forego the earlier climax for it. So what the hey, give 'em two! The reader probably won't know the difference anyway! Three  stars for this one, on the basis of a strong and dynamic narrative engine.  Nothing more. -- SWMrld and, of course, loyal and self-sacrificing to the core.) In fact there's too much here generally. One  action scene after another drives this plot.

But the effort is aborted early on by bad luck and only Bjarni  ends up making his way to the England of King William Rufus, successor to  William the Conqueror. There he does a few things to distinguish himself,  but nothing of any lasting note, longing instead for the farmstead and step  mother he has abandoned back in Iceland. How he returns and makes his  presence felt in that farm and his Icelandic district make up the remainder  of this tale. It's worth reading, not for the action but for the sharply  delineated and probing portrait of these people and especially of Bjarni  the almost-viking. Not the very best of the saga novels which have been written since the nineteenth century, but a modern one.

In the dark days of the very earliest middle ages  (around the time of Beowulf), we find Hrolf king of a small Norse kingdom  in what is today part of modern Denmark. Lord of the ancestors of the  modern Danes, this unprepossessing ruler of men gathers about him the  heroes of his day (or so legend apparently had it) and creates a brief  golden age in a violent time. But Hrolf is star-crossed, the product of an  unfortunate liaison between unhappy lovers (he is both son and brother to  his mother) and scion of a family of violent and bloody strivers, a hero  who, in the end, must defend all he has against the predations of his kin.  In the process he has numerous adventures, confronts dark magic and builds  a court of war-like champions. It's an episodic story which largely tracks  the original saga itself (since another version, translated by the scholar  Gwyn Jones, is almost the same although somewhat briefer). But it's a  nicely told, fast-paced tale and, if Anderson translated it himself, he did  a great job of it, turning it into a book in the genre of modern fantasy.

The \\"voice\\" is right, never once slipping into anachronistic modernisms and supplying a truly \\"transparent\\" medium, easily accessible to moderns, which yet conveys the immediacy of historical time and place. The tale is not plotted in any formal sense but proceeds in flashback, a hackneyed but effective mechanism here as we see the story unfold, both on the level of a life remembered and through the eyes of the Persian court in the midst of their final Greek campaign. The battle scenes are redolent with the misery and gore of real warfare, too, yet reverberate with the mystery of transcendency -- the real stuff of living and, of course, of dying. There is both an earthiness and a metaphysical element to this finely told tale of heroism in the face of overwhelming odds in a place and time which changed the flow of history as we know it. The characters are as real to us as the flesh and blood we see burning and wallowing in death upon the fields of Thermopylae. And we care about them, which, in the end, is what a book like this must be about. This one's nearly as good as Hope Muntz' THE GOLDEN WARRIOR, which yet remains, in my experience, the best of all historical novels to date. But this is a mighty close runner up.

The basic take-off point of the tale seems to be the machinations and ambitions of Anna Comnenus, the Byzantine princess who celebrated her father, the Emperor Alexius, in her well-known text, The Alexiad, itself a rather dry though intriguing document of the political twists &amp; turns and military escapades undertaken by the Byzantine Greeks of that time. The promise of it all was great. But not so, the execution. There are elements of intrigue and fantasy and adventure here but they are not well meshed. Some of the characters were promising and I did like the attempt to depict the life of the Byzantines on their wharfs and in their palaces. But the mixing of pagan deities with the real world of religious Byzantium just didn't work for me. Although I like this kind of stuff, I put this one down about half way through -- though I tried mightily to see it through to the end. But I failed. And so, regrettably, did this book. -- SWM	1998-10-25
US	51406912	R3PHKP2ADLH7V2	0451526236	420375395	Rob Roy	Books	3	9	14	N	N	Definitely not Scott's best!	For those seeking the famous tale on which the recent film wasbased, this will sorely disappoint. This is Scott's tale of a young Englishman, son of a prosperous middle class businessman, who is sent to live w/distant cousins in the north of England (just below the Scottish border) because of his failure to live up to his father's mercantile expectations of him. Here he becomes involved with all manner of intrigue and gets pulled into a vortex of events involving rebellion against the English crown, a scheming cousin, a beautiful girl and that famous Scottish outlaw and freedom fighter, Rob Roy. But the outlaw, certainly the most interesting character in the tale, is only a side player, so to speak, and makes a number of appearances, often in disguises (a favorite Scott motif), only to guide and/or rescue our blundering hero. This is most definitely not a tale of high adventure and derring do, and the complex and twisted intrigues of the plot do not sustain the book adequately. For those who like period pieces or the works of the masters (and Scott was certainly one), this book might be okay. But this is one of those rare instances where the movie, based apparently on Scott's preface to his book (in which he sketches out the life and times of the historical Rob Roy), is better. And frankly the movie wasn't half bad; far superior, in fact, to that other film of historical Scotland of the same vintage with Mel Gibson. Oddly enough, the Rob Roy film did worse at the box office. Who can account for some people's taste?<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]	1998-10-01

This is a wonderful adventure set in the Holy Land of Crusader fame, a tale of Richard the Lionheart, of his noble knight Sir Kennethof the Leopard (the prince royal of Scotland in disguise) and of the great Saracen ruler Saladin who fought the historical Richard to a stand-still in Palestine and showed his chivalry and nobility in the process. In fact, Scott's tale makes it clear that it is Saladin, not Richard, who is the nobler and wiser chieftain through a series of intrigues which see Saladin playing physician, matchmaker and spy all the while Richard is being gulled by traitors and self-interested allies around him. In fact, the great hearted Richard is moved to condemn to death his greatest knight and supporter, but for the machinations of Saladin and the loyalty of one good dog. This is a fun tale, full of adventure and exotic locales, every bit as strong as Ivanhoe, but, perhaps, just a shade less rich in colorful characters and mayhem. Read it anyway.

This author has a way with words and very credibly weaves the mythic &amp;  legendary tales of the old Norse folk (as we have these through the medium  of 12th &amp; 13th century Icelandic saga literature) into a meandering and  sometimes interesting speculative essay on the experience of exploration  &amp; discovery, as recorded in the old sagas (both of the Icelanders &amp;  of the Eskimos of Greenland). But whatever else this book is, and Vollman's  rendering of some of the old Norse legendry is quite nice, it is most  definitely NOT a novel. There is no plot here, no development of a tale out  of a person or persons' experiences, no imaginary world somehow made flesh  through the medium of events told or re-told by a storyteller of any sort.  In fact, except for the fact that this is a compendium of fictions and  mental meanderings in prose, there is nothing here to even suggest that  this writing is properly to be called a novel. There IS, on the other hand,  an interesting stream of words here which occasionally seems compelling but  which rarely enwraps us and which, in fact, grows quite tiring at times,  what with all its talk of ice shirts and blue shirts and bear shirts, etc.  The shirt metaphor, in fact, is apparently Mr. Vollman's way of describing  an attitude/point of view which informs some of his characters' world views  (&quot;blue&quot; for death-oriented, as in the symbolism of the old sagas  themselves, &quot;ice&quot; for cold indifference to others,  &quot;bear&quot; for dangerous, overweening madness which poses harm to  those around us).<br />It seems that Vollman is here eager to make a comment  on the ugliness of European colonization of the &quot;New World&quot; and  what it did to the innocent indigenous folk they found here, as  exemplified, in one vignette, by the Eskimo father who rescues his son from  cold-hearted Norse kidnappers in Greenland and then, regrettably, kills the  child for fear of contamination which cannot be undone. If only those  unenlightened Norse had not meddled with the pristine, good-hearted  natives! This book, in the end, is tendentious and tedious and just plain  heavy-handed. And, as Gertrude Stein once said of her native town,  &quot;there's no there there.&quot;<br />I came to this book because of a bad  review I saw of Jane Smiley's Greenlanders (a saga-like novel of the last  days of the Norse colony in Greenland) in which the reviewer took Ms.  Smiley to task for her prose and urged the interested reader to try  Vollman's The Ice Shirt, instead, for a really good rendering of saga  material. Well, allow me to attempt to reverse that rather silly judgement  here. Smiley did it well; on the other hand, I'm not sure what Mr. Vollman  has done. But, at the least, he has not written an historical novel. --  Stuart W. Mirsky swmirsky@usa.netf only those  unenlightened Norse had not meddled with the pristine, good-hearted  natives!

US	51406912	RPZ44PS14SS49	0380793539	234867967	Daughter of Troy	Books	4	25	27	N	N	A woman's experience beneath the walls of Troy...	I picked this one up w/some trepidation as the blurb on the back and a quick scan of the pages within suggested a bodice-ripper built on the foundation stones of that most revered of all things Greek -- The Iliad. I was pleased to see I was wrong. This is a tale of the Trojan War from a woman's perspective, particularly from the point of view of Briseis, the slave girl and victory prize of Achilles, over whom all the sturm und drang of that marvelous tale is raised. And it's a good one.<br /><br />For those who don't know the tale, it essentially recounts what happens to the Greek and Trojan armies in the final year of the bitter Trojan siege, when the Greek over-king, Agamemnon, forced to give up his own victory prize, the girl Chryseis because of a god's anger, seizes the slave girl of his greatest hero and war-leader, Achilles, as a consolation prize. The resultant pique of the proud Achilles leaves the Greeks without a champion and gives the Trojans a chance to reclaim the initiative on the battlefield. Not promising for a tale told entirely from a woman's perspective. And yet, the use of Briseis as witness and recounter of events is inspired. In fact, the author has succeeded admirably. The prose is brilliantly evocative of the times and ancient tale it has to tell, without being stale or hackneyed. Never once are we troubled with the \\"wine-dark sea\\" (an Homeric catch phrase, much overused these days), although the prose still manages to conjure up the land and climate of the country in which this all presumably occurred...as well as the culture of the people among whom the tale is set.<br /><br />The \\"voice\\" is mostly right, too. A woman's voice, begun as an old crone recounting her life to a wandering stranger, shifting quickly to a flashback of the seminal event of the tale beneath the Trojan walls, shifting again to this woman's emergence into young womanhood in her home city of Lyrnessos, a minor town within the Trojan orbit, only to take us back to the events under Troy's walls . . . the story we hear moves quickly and does not, for the most part, prove jarring or inconsistent with the times and events it has to tell of. The story of the Iliad is here portrayed as an almost conventional love story between Briseis and the mighty Achilles, but it works, as well, on the level of the original tale, the tragic encounter with violence and death which bring all men, as well as women, down in the end to the place of destruction and dissolution.<br /><br />There are a few weak moments unfortunately: when Chryseis, in the early part of the tale, observing Briseis in one of those Cretan gowns which exposes a woman's breasts, remarks that \\"you seem to be bursting out of your dress, darling\\" -- I thought I'd strayed into a Beverly Hills dinner party, or something worse. But for the most part, these odd moments do not detract overmuch from the tale.<br /><br />If I had one real complaint it is that the first half of the book is really much better than the second, perhaps because the slave-girl's perspective necessarily excludes Briseis from so much of the action, causing the events of the war to be told, in large part, via second hand accounts. The best parts of the book are certainly when we see Briseis' life through her own first hand experiences and encounter the world of the eastern Mediterranean as retold in the first half of the book, all so freshly brought to life via this author's vivid and poetic prose.<br /><br />Perhaps another reason for the weakening of the book in its second half is the large role Briseis' sexual adventures seem to play in the tale. Rather explicity recounted and certainly interesting, I came to conclude, in the second half, that too much of Briseis' recollections revolved around the copulations she recalls and the men who \\"have entered\\" her. It may have been likely that a slave girl and war prize would have had these sorts of experiences as a central part of her world, rather than the great battlesbeneath the besieged city's walls or the deliberations of the men who were prosecuting the dreadful war, but it seemed, ultimately, to trivialize the tale, making the great events mere reflections of the greater sex Briseis has with her hero Achilles, who killed her husband (a rather unpleasant fellow, by the way), her beloved brothers, and sacked and detroyed her native city. One would have thought that Briseis had reason to dwell on other things besides the size of Achilles' back and arms and other appurtenances, in light of the losses she has suffered. And Achillles sometimes seems to be nothing more than a Fabio look-alike, some woman's idea of the ideal sex object -- able to go on all night, providing both mount and rider, on demand, to his discriminating and lustful female partner, depending on her preferences and mood.<br /><br />At the risk of turning a good review bad, however, let me stress that the story is well-told although it weakens substantially at the end for the reasons I've cited. But this is a tough one to tell, given that Homer and the other ancient Greek bards have all done it so well before. I think the author has here done a better job than some \\"contemporaries\\", certainly vividly and realistically capturing the feel of the ancient cults of the old proto-Greeks (better than Mary Renault, it seems to me, in The King Must Die, and nearly as good as Robert Graves did it in Hercules, My Shipmate) . . . and offered a highly literate and compelling modern narrative window into the great story of The Iliad, besides. If the sex seemed a bit much, well, perhaps that is a necessary concession to draw in today's reader (or at least to convince a publisher that this will occur) -- though I'd have been a bit more conservative in that regard if I'd have had the skill and inspiration to pen such a well-told tale myself.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]e deliberations of the men who were prosecuting the dreadful war, but it seemed, ultimately, to trivialize the tale, making the great events mere reflections of the greater sex Briseis has with her hero Achilles, who killed her husband (a rather unpleasant fellow, by the way), her beloved brothers, and sacked and detroyed her native city.

Robert Graves was a marvelous historical novelist &amp; poet (just read Hercules, My Shipmate, Homer's Daughter, or I, Claudius). But this particular effort falls regrettably flat. It does, however, read like much of the actual material from the period. But Byzantine stuff tended to be rather portentous &amp; stuffy -- bureaucratese par excellence -- and Graves captures the very essence of it here. Unfortunately, it doesn't work all that well for a piece of fiction like this is trying to be. The sense of &quot;realness&quot; in the people just doesn't shine through. There's no solid dramatization of the action and everything is told like a slow and ponderous memoir -- true to the times but less than satisfying from the point of view of historical fiction. Nevertheless, if you like historical stuff &amp; an authentic feel for the time, you might like this one. But I'd recommend some of the others already mentioned instead. Or The Golden Warrior by Hope Muntz -- a really taut, authentic historical piece depicting a very different, and even more dramatic, time. That one's also one of the best historical novels ever written. Just thought I'd mention it. -- Stuart W. Mirsky	1998-04-30

Using internal evidence which suggests female authorship and a relationship of the terrain described to areas in the western Mediterranean, Graves speculates that the true author told her own story, possibly a true one, buried within the Homeric epic which has been handed down to us via the ancient Greeks. To get it included among the Homeric canon this young, energetic and extremely intelligent woman manages to get the tale incorporated into the body of Homeric songs through the auspices of a member of the Homeric guild. But, scholarly speculation aside, this is basically a tale of adventure and intrigue as it recounts the events surrounding the siege of a king's household by rebellious nobles using a suit for his young daughter's hand as an excuse to undermine and destroy her father's rule. The princess, clever and indomitable by turns, first investigates the mystery of her elder brother's disappearance and then organizes a shrewd counterplot, reminiscent of Odysseus' triumphal and bloody return to Ithaca, to reclaim her father's holdings and the honor of his house. A bit slow and ponderous in the beginning, and somewhat too scholarly, it nevertheless comes sharply to life in the second half of the book as the plot to undo the suitors' predations hurtles toward its bloody resolution. A good tale and worth the read, though it's not quite as compelling or erudite as Graves' other work in this vein: Hercules, My Shipmate -- a tale of Jason and his Argonauts on the quest for the Golden Fleece. -- Stuart W.

The text begins interestingly enough, albeit somewhat ponderously, as Poul Anderson, one of the greats of Science Fiction & Fantasy, essays once more to travel the mist-shrouded roads of Faery. Writing at least since the fifties (I enjoyed his stuff going back to  the sixties), Anderson's \\"voice\\" seems to have mellowed and subtly altered with the passing of the years. Never one of the most moving or most profound of tale spinners, he was always, nevertheless, the consummate storyteller. Still this present tale lacks the energy and vitality of his earlier saga-like excursions. While The Broken Sword leaped with life and blood and darkness and Hrolf Kraki's Saga (basically a translation of a legendary Danish-Norse tale, with some additions by the author to make it more contemporary) charged onward from episode to episode until crashing mightily on the rocks of it's own climactic shore, this new tale seems oddly stilted and self-conscious. The language does not pour forth, carrying the reader over the unsure ground of fantasy, as Anderson was wont to do in former days, and the characters he has given us here seem paler than in the past -- and not nearly as interesting as their predecessors were. The protagonist, Hadding the Dane-King, for instance, moves sluggishly from one odd episode to another, always winning his battles and defeating his foes, never seeming to be in any serious danger at all, a circumstance which ultimately seems to tell on him as much as it does on us. And the people around him, as well as his enemies, never seem to be quite worthy of the attention he lavishes on them. Fostered by giants of old Norse legend and lover to his own foster mother (or sister) who adopts human form to be with him, guided by  a mysterious one-eyed \\"wanderer\\", Hadding ought to be more multi-faceted than the invincible, noble hero we are given. Through much of this tale only the relatively easy-read prose (despite the incorporation of archaic words and forms to set the mood) and the intrinsically promising subject-matter (for those of us who like the Norse thing) keeps you reading. Written stolidly and with far more description than one is likely to find in the real Icelandic and Norse stuff, the tale yet retains the sleepy, dream-like presentation of events and images which is so characteristic of this material in its original form -- a form in which giants are never quite giants as we understand them (for they seem larger or smaller depending on their surroundings) and gods walk about like magicians. Nevertheless, Anderson has here created a tale which, surprisingly and for all its apparent faults, does stand up -- and admirably so, in the end. It is a story of sadness and, finally, understanding -- sketched against a backdrop of adventure and fighting and killing. The last part of the book redeems the slowness and awkward-seeming \\"forced\\" prose that went before as the truth of the tale is relentlessly brought home -- how a single life may be more than its appearance alone and how the worlds of fantasy and reality may intersect afterall. It's just a story, Anderson says in his afterword and, indeed, it is that -- but a story which reached me in a largely unexpected way. It takes an historical legend from much earlier times and revives it in a manner which does honor to the source material from which it is drawn while yet placing it in a perspective we moderns can grasp. As The Broken Sword was, no doubt, a young man's breathless and headlong tale (Anderson himself once suggested this in a foreword he'd written somewhat later to that book), so this one is the work of another writer entirely -- one who has lived his life and seen the fullness of it and its inevitable denouement. This one goes deeper than it seemed at the first. And redeems itself, and all of us, for that.<br /><br />Stuart W.

Seeking to reprise his earlier success with The Last of the Mohicans, James Fenimore Cooper went on to write several other tales built around his heroic character Natty Bumppo (called \\"Hawkeye\\" in Mohicans and \\"Pathfinder\\" in the book of THAT name). In this one our hero is known as \\"Deerslayer\\" for his facility on the hunt and is shown as the younger incarnation of that paragon of frontier virtue we got to know in the earlier books. In this one, too, we see how he got his most famous appellation: \\"Hawkeye\\". But, this time out, our hero comes across as woefully tiresome (perhaps it's because we see too much of him in this book, where he's almost a side character in Mohicans). Yet some of Cooper's writing skills seem sharper here (he no longer avers that Natty is the taciturn type, for instance, while having the fellow forever running off at the mouth). But, while there are some good moments & excitement, this tale really doesn't go all that far -- and its rife with cliches already overworked from the earlier books. The worst part is the verbose, simple-minded self-righteousness of our hero, himself, taken to the point of absolute unbelievability. He spurns the love of a beautiful young woman (though he obviously admires her) for the forester's life (as though he couldn't really have both), yet we're expected to believe he's a full-blooded young American male. And he's insufferably \\"moral\\", a veritable goody two-shoes of the woodlands. At the same time, the Indians huff & puff a lot on the shore of the lake where Deerslayer finds himself in this tale (in alliance with a settler, his two daughters, a boorish fellow woodsman, and Deerslayer's own erstwhile but loyal Indian companion Chingachgook -- \\"The Big Sarpent,\\" as Natty translates his name). But the native Americans seem ultimately unable to overwhelm the less numerous settlers who have taken refuge from them in the middle of Lake Glimmerglass (inside a frontier house built of logs and set in the lake bed on stilts). There is much racing around the lake as Deerslayer and the others strive to keep the few canoes in the vicinity from falling into the hands of the tribe of marauding Hurons who have stopped in the nearby woods on their way back up to Canada (fleeing the American colonists and the British at the outbreak of English-French hostilities -- since these Hurons are allied with the French). And there are lots of dramatic encounters, with some deaths, but the Indians seem to take it all with relative equanimity, while trying to find a way to get at the whites who are precariously ensconced out on the lake. (It seems to take them the better part of two days, for instance, to figure out they can build rafts to make up for their lack of canoes -- and why couldn't they just build their own canoes, in any case -- and how is it they don't have any along with them since it's obvious they'll have to cross a number of waterways to successfully make it back to the homeland in Canada?) The settler and the boorish woodsman, for their part, do their stupid best to attack the Indians unnecessarily, getting captured then ransomed in the process, while Deerslayer and Chingachgook contrive to get the loyal Indian's betrothed free from the Hurons (it seems she has been kidnapped by them -- the reason Deerslayer and Chingachgook are in the vicinity in the first place). In the meantime the simple-minded younger daughter of the settler (Cooper seems to like this motif since he used a strong daughter and a simpler sister in Mohicans, as well) wanders in and out of the Indian's encampment without sustaining any hurt on the grounds that the noble red men recognize the \\"special\\" nature of this poor afflicted young woman (Cooper used this motif in Mohicans, too). In the end there's lots of sturm und drang but not much of a tale -- at least not one which rings true or touches the right chords for the modern reader.

Written in a fashion which recalls Clavell's Shogun, this is a tale of an English sailor's adventure in deepest Africa during the early years of European colonization. Lost on the shores of Portuguese Africa, our hero finds himself first impressed into the service of the European masters of this land -- later establishing himself in the local colonial community. But the real highlight of this book occurs when he finds himself trapped in the back country where he becomes a servant to a savage cannibal king whom the Europeans and other native peoples live in fear of.

Not the best of the saga-like fantasies, this one's nevertheless quite unique in its odd melding of fantasy & the scientific justification presented to make the tale seem real. The elves, a cold and clever race, not truly malevolent but quite indifferent to men, are beings apart (along with their enemies the trolls and the goblins & other faerie folk). They are  unable to withstand sunlight or the touch of iron but are yet rich in alternative, albeit medieval, technologies. They use unheard of alloys of silver for their tools and weaponry and \\"frictionless\\" ships to ply the seas.<br /><br />Here is the story of a mortal taken into this world as a babe, replaced in his cradle by a changeling infant, half troll, half elf, but conjured into the image of the child he has replaced, and of how these two grow to manhood in their respective worlds -- the human to serve the needs of the elves, by handling the iron they cannot touch themselves, and the changeling to come to revile and betray the mortal family he was raised to believe were his kin. Both are betrayed by the worlds in which they are raised and lost for that -- the human for the inhuman heritage he has been raised with; the changeling for his longing for a human soul and his hatred of those who have what he cannot.<br /><br />The plot is set in motion by the curse of a witch, herself the victim of the harshly brutal behavior of the stolen babe's father, and pivots on the interplay of the magical beings of faerie and the gods who toy with them. All are players and yet pieces, too, on a great chessboard which none knows the extent of -- and the stakes are the very existence of the magical beings and the gods themselves.<br /><br />Into this world the human, Scafloc, is thrust, a preening and overconfident hero among the elves who finds his fate and his end through a forbidden love and, in so doing, brings into the world the greatest evil, even as he strives to save those who have raised him. Not a happy tale by any stretch, yet headlong and well-told.

Contrary to some, I found this book to be a fine historical piece. Written in saga form (to evoke the people & times it is intended to describe), this novel captures the clean-lined, flat beauty of saga prose. The story itself reflects the last 50 years or so of the Norse colony in Greenland as it slides into oblivion beneath the combined weight of a dramatically colder climate and its consequent abandonment by Europe.<br /><br />Increasingly beleaguered by a climate which has shrunk the growing and grazing seasons and has made it more difficult to attempt the ocean passage to Greenland using the available seagoing technology of the times, the Greenlanders soon found themselves facing another threat as well: the Eskimos who moved down into their territory, attracted by the colder climate. The inevitable culture clashes result, leading to violence which can only end in one way for the Greenlanders who cannot compete in this new environment with the nomadic, hunting culture of these other peoples. The Greenlanders, mainly farmers and marginal hunters, can no longer grow enough food to survive nor can they sustain themselves entirely by hunting because of the rigors of doing so in an increasingly colder world. At the same time, the Black Death in Europe has caused the Europeans to briefly turn inward, exacerbating the dwindling trade connection which the Greenlanders had come to be increasingly dependent on, absent the ability to survive as subsistence farmers on the farthest edge of the \\"European world\\".<br /><br />The story follows the coming of age of a young Greenland girl, Margret, who is one of the last representatives of her modestly prosperous farm family. As she grows to womanhood she sees the steady and inexorable decline of her way of life all about her, while doing her best to hold things together. We see the Greenlanders feuding among themselves, as these Norse folk were wont to do in other venues, their conflicts and momentary triumphs in dealings with the Norwegian traders who visit them less and less often, their voyages to the North American coast (in search of valued timber and the long lost country of \\"Vinland the Good\\"), and, finally, their ill-fated contacts with the newly arriving Eskimos.

When I went back to re-read this book after several years, so I could do this review, I couldn't understand why I didn't remember much about it. After finishing it for the second time, I now see why: despite a skillful command of the language and her material, Mary Renault's efforts here fall well short of the positive critical reception with which this book was received when it was initially published. Working with recently developed theories, based on modern archaelogical discoveries which reveal a labrynthine palatial structure in ancient Crete, along with a tradition of sacred &quot;bull dancing&quot; (which may be the historical precursor of the Spanish tradition of bull fighting and of bull running in Pamplona), Renault here crafts a modern re-telling of the Theseus legend -- the boy hero of Athens condemned as a sacrifice to the Cretan minotaur in Cnossos, who dwelt within a mysterious labarynth from which no one who entered could ever find his or her way out again. In the legendary tale, Theseus wins the love of Ariadne, the princess of Crete, and she tells him how to find his way through to the monster and safely out again (using a string to trace his way through the maze). In the end the hero kills the monster and steals away with the princess, though he subsequently abandons her on one of the islands south of the Greek mainland. Modern archaelogy certainly appears to confirm the existence of many of the elements found in the legend and Renault wove these together into her narrative to make a quick-reading, modern tale (which is still true to its legendary antecedents). But, despite the author's obvious erudition, the tale never leaps to life and the reconstruction of the ancient Minyan, Achaian and Cretan cultures, while intelligently done, never fulfills its promise. It's hard to care very much about these people and you never quite feel the reality of the cultures in which the tale is told. The love scenes are &quot;tastefully&quot; cryptic, in keeping with the mores of the time and milieu in which the book was presented, but there is an overly intellectual quality here, a distance and abstract coolness which never quite seizes the reader to make the book live. So, while the book reads well, for the most part, and is professionally executed, it doesn't achieve the highest levels of literary accomplishment to which a good novel (historical or otherwise) should aspire. Robert Graves did the Greek thing much better in his &quot;Hercules, My Shipmate&quot; (though that book is, perhaps, a bit more esoteric and therefore less accessible to the average reader) and Hope Muntz did it best of all, for historical novels in general, with her &quot;The Golden Warrior&quot; about the epic struggle for power and England, between Harold and William, in 1066. Mary Renault, despite the kindness of reviewers at the time, just doesn't approach them with this book. -- Stuart W.

This is the story of a Japanese commoner who rose from the ranks of peasant to foot soldier to chief general of the realm and, ultimately, to become the successor of his overlord after that man's assassination. In the process the man who was known as \\"Monkey\\" to many of his contemporaries became the Taiko -- completing the work of unification of Japan (basically military conquest of the other warlords & clans) begun by his predecessor, the brilliant and fearsome Oda Nobunaga. It was a time in Japan before the social classes had frozen into the near absolute rigidity of later days, when people could still become samurai, even if they weren't born to it, and Monkey displays his tenacity and genius for organization to good effect in this context, impressing Nobunaga who plucks him from obscurity to make him a lord. Thought the least likely to succeed Nobunaga of all that warlord's generals and allies, the Taiko outwits those who who would have the job (or the country, for that matter) after Nobunaga and, using his strategic skills and ability to manage large and complex organizations and expeditions, defeats one after another of them on the battlefield. He does this less by open conflict than by outmaneuvering, outlasting and outbuilding them. In the end he is the last one standing, the head of a triumvirate of lords guaranteeing a brief period of stability during a time of change and unrest in the land. But the Taiko's moment is to be shortlived, however dramatic his ascent, for he is already rather advanced in years and everything he has built is destined to go to another after his death: his ally and junior, Tokugawa Ieyesu -- the man who founded the Tokugawa Shogunate (subject of James Clavell's fascinating fictional account in \\"Shogun\\").

For lovers of adventure, pioneer tales, westerns and Cooper's own \\"leatherstocking\\" stories, this one's not bad. Not up to the pacing, depth or vision demonstrated by Cooper in \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", this book nevertheless continues the adventures of the wilderness scout Natty Bumppo (\\"Hawkeye\\" in \\"Mohicans\\" and \\"Pathfinder\\" here). Still the prototype of that strong, silent and simple man of virtue (who finds a higher moral calling in the wilderness among his beloved Indians and far from the zones of civilization whom we met in \\"Mohicans\\"), Natty now seems somewhat older (though not much time appears to have elapsed) and longing, at last, for what he has always eschewed: a place and family of his own. Brought to a lakeside fort (Lake Ontario) at the urging of an old friend who is in charge of running the day to day soldiering at the fort and who desires to play matchmaker between his daughter and Pathfinder, Natty soon finds himself in the midst of intrigue and betrayal on the lake. It is still the time of the French and Indian Wars and the action involves naval activity on the lake and in the Thousand Islands. But Natty soon finds he has competition for the hand of his old friend's daughter in the person of a young naval officer who promptly falls under suspicion because of his French origins. In the end, Pathfinder must get to the bottom of the betrayal while making the noble choice with regard to the fair maiden and his rival for her hand. The action involves a swift \\"sea\\" chase over Ontario and a denoument among the Thousand Islands as Pathfinder and his faithful companion, Chingachgook, seek to protect the small military force in their charge from a French attack which is aided by unknown turncoats in their midst. It's a good story but less powerful, and a good deal more wooden, than \\"Mohicans\\". Natty, himself, seems a might too talkative for the strong silent type he is alleged to be (didn't seem as problematic in the earlier \\"Mohicans\\" as it does here), but there are some good moments including an opening scene where the great forested country is vividly depicted, a fine shooting match at the fort (reminiscent of Scott's knightly tourneys), an exciting chase across the face of the lake and a fine wrap-up when Pathfinder struggles to save the outgunned outpost in his charge.

A quick &amp; satisfying portrayal of Arthur the Romanized Celt who halted, for a brief time, the inexorable Saxon advance which ultimately gave us England &amp; Wales. Not overly steeped in the fantastic and the &quot;hard-to-believe&quot;, it reads &quot;true&quot; to the few historical sources and the background material we have of this time today. And it offers just a touch of mystery: Merlin appears as a vision who makes himself known to Arthur at crucial moments in his life (to guide him toward his destiny) while the Faerie folk are presented as the primitive and diminutive stone-age remnants of the first men to inhabit the British Isles (w/all the &quot;magic&quot; of such primitive peoples and the fear of the unknown they may inspire among the ignorant). This tale depicts a very convincing Romano/British world, fighting against the insistent thrust of the newer, land-hungry Germanic peoples. Arthur &amp; his companions are a convincing crew, as well, as they move through the old legends but w/a modern spin. My main quibble is with the dream-like experiences of Arthur among the Faerie folk. I couldn't quite see why he should have felt &quot;out of time&quot; or forgotten his own kind and self while in their midst, nor did their existence seem at all the idyllic sort which Arthur appears to experience among them. Maybe its just my modern prejudices showing through, but I thought the author included this stuff more in the spirit of a pro-forma nod to the legendary magic, to explain it to us moderns, because what, afterall, is an Arthurian tale without its mysterious wizard and enchantresses? Yet it's ultimately unconvincing &amp; rather silly. Living in filthy hovels in the earth among the Faerie, surrounded by one's cattle and sheep may be okay to those who haven't lived differently, but few will choose it when they have other options. Arthur's difficulty in forsaking this life because of its spiritual quality just didn't ring true. (Witness the rapid demise of this form of life wherever primitive nomads encounter more modern lifestyles in our time.) Still, this provides the author one means of imparting what he seems to believe are the necessary, traditional magic and fantasy elements. While my preferences lean toward books which truly smell of their times (and this one is an historical/fantasy novel told by an Arthur with a deceptively modern sensibility), I thought it actually did work, and that it manages to convince and carry the reader into a reasonable facsimile of what Arthurian Britain may have been like. Not all that easy a task, as numerous failed Arthur tales have shown us. -- Stuart W.

When Xerxes, the Persian King of Kings, fearing the onset of decrepitude and old age, turns to his personal alchemist and sorcerer Ostanas, for a magical solution, the game (as Holmes used to say) is afoot. Reprieved from an untimely death (decreed for his unknowing complicity in the rape of a young noble woman), Bessas of Zariaspa (a big hulking, mother-loving, heroic lug, formerly of the King's own troops) is saved at the eleventh hour from an untimely seat on the royal stake and charged with two tasks: bring back to Xerxes the ear of a king; and find and capture a live dragon (said to dwell at the headwaters of the Nile, deep in unknown Africa). His companion on this mission is to be his former Greek tutor, Myron of Miletos, who just happens to also be the man who brought Bessas to the attention of the King, in time to save the big warrior's life.<br /><br />What neither of these adventurers knows, however, is that the King's sorcerer needs a third item as well: the heart of a hero, which presumably will be readily available -- once Bessas returns from his labors with the two items he has been sent to retrieve. Myron, a simple scholar with philosophical pretensions, sees their excursion as an opportunity to explore the world and create some grand theory out of the knowledge he garners, to make a name for himself among the Greek philosophers back home. Bessas, on the other hand, has other concerns since Xerxes has placed his mother in protective custody -- as a guarantor of the hero's ultimate return.<br /><br />These two set out on a fascinating journey which takes them through many of the lands of the old Persian Empire. In the process, they pick up a tubby local boy whose chief claim to fame seems to be his voracious sexual appetite, a Syrian mystic of dubious talents and loyalties, and a Judean of Philistine ancestry with the skills of a metal smith. Fleeing numerous attacks on their persons by the minions of the raped girl's family (who begrudge the King's decision to free Bessas), this motley company finds its way to Egypt. There they become involved in a little grave robbing, before heading farther south to the barbarous country of Kush, where the local ruler adds a further task to their assignments as a fee for letting them pass deeper into the African interior.<br /><br />Having linked up with a bandit Arab clan, headed by an old shaykh and his clever and beautiful daughter, the whole gang proceeds south along the Nile into \\"pestilential plains,\\" the abode of unfamiliar and savage peoples. How the tale ends up is worth the read, as is the fascinating protrayal of this time and its inhabitants. Suffice it to say they have a number of rather close encounters, not least of which with a kingdom of local cannibals, and generally squeak by -- though not without a good deal of bloodshed and mayhem.<br /><br />The tale is not the usual sword and sorcery fare (though its author was known for writing that stuff) since, while there is a great deal of talk about wizards and magic, there is no attempt to portray these as anything more than the grossest of superstitions. The heroes are also men of their time and do not scruple to kill an enemy in cold blood. In fact, this book is almost hardheaded in its realistic approach to human conflict. The dialogue's rather cleverly done, too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the tale was penned back in 1961 (although I read the Donning book, issued in 1982) and so it's not attentive to some of the politically correct niceties of our own era. Blacks are generally presented as savages and unattractive (which may actually have been how characters like our travellers would have seen them -- especially in the context of the encounters described -- but this will certainly offend some readers who are more attuned to contemporary sensitivities). Similarly, the Judean Shimri (really a Philistine and an idolator) is described as having a receding chin, spitting when he talks, stammering and as being generally annoying -- all for no very obvious reason. Perhaps de Camp based the character on someone he knew, but it does seem a trifle gratuitous. I suspect some would find him an offensively stereotypical character, as well.<br /><br />Finally, the female characters have no individual vitality at all. The Arab princess is supposed to be the real leader of her band but at critical times she recedes unaccountably into the background. The other two females who join the expedition in Africa are slaves and get used as such. Probably not unrealistic, but again not attuned to our present, more enlightened age. And their main role (even that of the bold princess) seems to be to fawn over our hero, Bessas.<br /><br />While the female characters have little life in them, the males, who are somewhat more interesting, are not more deeply drawn. Myron and Bessas do come to life, as does the sterotypical Syrian wizard, but none of them seems to have a substantial inner life. But this is a plot driven by events -- not motivation -- and, as such, it does its work. If you can bear with the extremely poor editing (typos on nearly every other page) and the mid-twentieth century sensibility, this is a book well worth the read -- both for its vivid and historically convincing depiction of the ancient world during the height of the Persian Empire (just before Alexander the Great Hellenized things) and for its fast-paced adventure in exotic lands.<br /><br />Stuart W.

If you like Greek myth, adventure and the classics, you're not likely to dislike this one. Graves, a renowned poet and classicist (and rather eccentric iconoclast) here retells the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, bringing these rather rambunctious fellows to life in a manner which is surprising, yet wholly consistent with the original material. Putting his own gloss on the mythic times celebrated afterwards in classical Greece and Rome, Graves posits a culture of ancient origin in the Mediteranean, totemic and cult-like, onto which the pantheon of the sky gods of the invading Greek tribes was subsequently grafted. To Graves, the myths handed down to the classical writers (and which they preserved and elaborated on, and then handed on to us) reflected the clash of these two religious views. The mythic creatures we came to know as centaurs and nymphs, for instance, would, on his telling, have been people not unlike ourselves, but affiliated with one or another of the ancient cults (rooted in belief in the divinity of the ancient \\"triple goddess\\").<br /><br />Like primitive tribesmen in many societies, these folk built their lives around their ritualistic practices and fetishes. The centaurs are called such, for instance, because they live in fraternal clans in semi-primitive conditions revering the centaur totem and mating with this or that college of nymphs, as the need arises and in accordance with the ritualistic requirements of the times. The institution of marriage (considered in this telling an affront to the \\"triple goddess\\") is brought in by the sky peoples from the north -- those who would later become the Greeks known to classical antiquity, after these had supplanted and absorbed the older peoples they found in the territory they conquered.<br /><br />So this tale is set in the time when these two peoples were first encountering one another and is presented as a conflict which grew out of the tension between the differing religious views and backgrounds. In this context, the story tracks Jason as he raises a crew to reclaim a fleece trimmed with gold which was sacred to the new sky god, Zeus, but which had apparently been spirited away by adherents of the triple goddess. Jason, rather unprepossessing as a hero though a remarkably handsome fellow, pulls into his orbit many of the great heroes and most accomplished adventurers of his day, including the mighty Hercules -- a rather likeable, if brutish, lout who gets by on his prodigious strength and amazing good luck.<br /><br />But Hercules doesn't make it through the entire voyage (his attention span is not overly long it seems) and he becomes sidetracked in a search for Hylas, his adopted son (taken after he killed the boy's parents), when Hylas makes his getaway. (Hercules seems to have had a more than fatherly interest in the boy, which doesn't sit well with Hylas when he discovers the beauteous possibilities to be had in a local college of nymphs.) Even without the redoubtable Hercules however, the Argonauts press on (in fact they have conspired to abandon him in order to save themselves from his clumsy and dangerous excesses), and navigate the Black Sea to the land of Colchis where the fleece, object of their quest, is kept.<br /><br />There they engage in all the appropriate deceptions in order to steal the prize from under the unwitting eyes of the Colchians (aided by the Colchian king's daughter, Medea, who is quite smitten with the handsome, if inconstant, Jason). The rest of the tale recounts their escape and the killings they must involve themselves in to make good their theft, and the  ritualized atonements they must undertake thereafter.<br /><br />Graves manages to convey a sense of the magical and mysterious without resort to the clumsy mythological creatures of ancient Greek tale, by relying on the mystic elements of the ancient religions his characters practiced (whether of the old or new variety). No one gets turned into a beast except metaphorically, and perhaps in spirit, and the biggest monster seems to be an overly large Python which the Colchians keep to guard the purloined fleece -- or perhaps the biggest monster is really Hercules himself.<br /><br />Even the Hellenes are presented in a fetchingly realistic manner when we see these blonde, blue-eyed men painting their bodies and doing a sort of war dance on the beach before they embark on the first leg of their journey, or when we watch them posturing and posing like so many primitives in the flush of battle. Women get treated rather well in this context since the older society is matriarchal in nature and dominated by various powerful priestesses and nymphs.<br /><br />The tale is driven as much by the interplay of the many fascinating characters (Orpheus the clever musician and adept of the triple goddess, Atalanta the virgin warrior and her various suitors, on board the Argo and off) as by the adventure of the quest itself. And the end takes the surviving players through to their respective fates, always consistent with the characters they have shown themselves in the course of their adventures to be. It may seem overly long to the contemporary reader in some parts and somewhat episodic, but it takes us back to a time which might really have been and gives us a slant on things which we don't ordinarily get from a straight reading of the classics.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801518 The King of Vinland's Saga]]monster seems to be an overly large Python which the Colchians keep to guard the purloined fleece -- or perhaps the biggest monster is really Hercules himself.

Not a bad take on viking \\"adventure\\" in the ninth century as the hero embarks on a raid against the English coast from a viking stronghold in Ireland. The writing's fairly taut and fresh and the plot cracks along but the modern tone, though justified by the surprise plot twist at the end, seems remarkably out of place. We get a fairly good tour of the English (and Welsh) countryside as our reluctant viking protagonist learns to raid and kill in the best tradition of his forebears, gets lost from his raiding party and hooks up with a lovely, if mysterious, female companion and finally finds his shipmates again, only to get swept overboard, with the girl, and end up in the monastery at Lindisfarne just prior to the historical raid on that site which kicked off the full scale viking age in England -- which was to trouble the natives there for the next hundred years or so. We get an oddly bracing picture of these vikings too, professional warriors that they were, as they ready themselves for each upcoming encounter (not unlike the limbering-up exercises of a modern football team about to meet the \\"other side\\" out on the gridiron in a friendly match) -- you almost have to believe in the realism of it all, despite the warm fuzzy feeling you get once you've really gotten to know these boys. Even Thorfinn Skullsplitter seems like the kind of guy you wouldn't mind splitting a beer with -- assuming that's all he's in the mood for cleaving. But the dragon stuff seems rather forced and out of place. And the end, clever as it is, only adds to the sense that this book and this author didn't quite know where they wanted to go with the story. The protagonist's \\"voice\\" lapses into a rather sophomoric, counter-cultural patois as the tale winds down, which is both jarring and debilitating to the rest of the tale. And, though it's justified by the ending, the ending itself is discordant with what went before. You may guess it from the way the story moves, but I doubt you'll figure out the locale.<br /><br />The surprise ending in this one seems to have pleased many readers but I found it a bit off-putting, myself, turning what had seemed to me to be a good, and nicely paced, historical yarn into something a bit too self-concious and cute.

Affecting the ornate cadences of King James English, which was the common usage of 19th century saga translations, E.R. Eddison here recreates the saga that might have been (had one survived) of Styrbiorn Olafsson, heir to one-half of the Swedish throne in the tenth century. Styrbiorn, surnamed \\"the Strong\\" for his remarkable size and physical accomplishments, is mentioned only briefly in Snorri Sturlasson's Heimskringla (the Norse Book of Kings) and elsewhere, and does not seem to have merited a saga of his own to chronicle his rather brief and tumultuous life. At the least, no such saga has survived. Early on Styrbiorn establishes his viking credentials when he goes into a voluntary three-year exile at the urging of King Eirik, his uncle, who will not consent to share the throne with him until he has demonstrated a certain amount of Norse maturity. Although a youth of prodigious strength, who amuses himself by wrestling with his pet ox in his spare time, and of unusual fairness, Styrbiorn is also somewhat of a dullard by modern standards -- unable to fathom the deeper matters of policy and human interaction. Still he is an honorable fellow and not unintelligent in his own way as he demonstrates in his dealings with the Jomsburg vikings, who accept him as one of their leaders after a dramatic shipboard duel, and later in his encounter with the legendary Danish King Harold Gormsson (surnamed \\"Blue-Tooth\\" for his rather prominent dental problems). Still, Styrbiorn is ultimately undone by his own impetuousness and susceptibililty to the allure of the young and beautiful wife of his uncle, the legendary Sigrid the Haughty. Having returned to Sweden earlier than promised and discovering himself drunk in Sigrid's bed after a dream-like carousal of the night before, Styrbiorn is unable to suppress his shame and despair at having cuckholded Eirik, his uncle and benefactor. Enraged by his apparently brutish rejection of her after their steamy nighttime tryst, Sigrid now plays Potiphar's wife to Styrbiorn's Joseph and cries out that she has been raped and violated by him. Eirik, knowing Styrbiorn's past arrogance only too well, is more than willing to believe the worst of him, and swiftly chases Styrbiorn from the palace and kingdom, leaving his nephew with no other means to reclaim his patrimony but the sword. Styrbiorn does not scruple at this, though it galls him to do it, and, in a final confrontation with his uncle, casts his hopes in a final toss for all or nothing on Fyrisfield. But Styrbiorn is undone and falls in the conflict while those of his followers who survive must flee into the woods to save their lives. Despite the power of the language of this tale, which is both beautifully wrought and heroically evocative, the book ultimately leaves one unsatisfied. The last great battle occurs almost as an afterthought, off-stage, while the final scene is like a deus ex machina in reverse with Odin, the chief god of the Nordic pantheon, seated like some old testament vision on his throne above the earth, prononuncing his verdict -- that he has taken Styrbiorn for his own. We are transported abruptly and without fair warning from the domain of the saga to another place, which is somehow discordant with all that has gone before. It is as though Eddison, who had labored so mightily and with such skill to render this epic tale, had suddenly grown tired of his own words and ended it as best he could, for want of anything more to say. The book, though finely crafted and with  characters who come brilliantly to life in the high-toned speeches placed in their mouths by the author, ultimately totters and stumbles to an awkward and unsatisfying end. Still, for some of the finest prose in English literature (old or modern) or one of the purest evocations of the old Norse sagas and tales, few books have done it better. By Stuart W.
