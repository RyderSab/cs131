The grammar and pronunciation are very well explained,  there are good illustrative examples,  and the phrasebook is extensive and useful.  There is also interesting material about the Igbo history and culture.<br />However,  the included dictionary gives no guidance about the tones used in pronouncing the words it defines. Words are NOT marked for tone in the dictionary.  Since tone is phonemic in Igbo (as in Chinese,  for instance) this is a very serious limitation and it prevents the reader from building up a vocabulary by browsing the dictionary and plugging new words into sentences introduced in the phrasebook and grammar sections.  If there was a lot of other material available for learning Igbo one wouldn't need to use the dictionary this way,  but there really isn't.  <br />Hopefully in a future edition the authors will rectify this sin of omission.	2001-11-14

It really is a shame that this book has been allowed to go out of print because it beats its competition going away. <br />The grammar-based approach to language instruction seems to have gone out of fashion,  but for a clearly- written,  systematic exposition of how demotic Greek works,  this is still the top of the line.  The examples in the lessons and the exercises will work very well for learning the language inductively even if the terminology seems intimidating.<br />This book will be very rewarding to anyone who perseveres with it.	2001-11-13

And tapes to go with it!<br />The Tagalog language has been long-neglected by publishers of language materials.  This fine course helps make up for the deficiency.  The lessons are very well-designed,  the explanations of a grammar very different from our own are not difficult to follow,  and there is a lot of interesting material about Filipino culture.  Also,  the tape I purchased with the book is excellent and an invaluable help in picking up the pronunciation.<br />Much has been made of the lack of accent marking in the text.  I for one don't see why accents are not marked in the vocabulary lists for each lesson- that is the usual practice in texts on other languages with unpredictable accentuation- Russian,  for instance- so that if the reader forgets the stress in the main body of the text,  she can always refer back to the vocabulary. The book does have all entries in the back marked with accents,  however it is a nuisance to have to consult the glossary to learn the stress of each new word,  if you don't have the tape right at hand.  That's a minor fault,  however.<br />And I'm so happy to have a usable Tagalog course at last that I don't even mind.	2001-11-13

This one ain't it.  It's introduction to the alphabet isn't even as good as Mace's in the nightmarish &quot;Teach Yourself Persian&quot;.  The book isn't sold with tapes,  and,  from an old record (Conversaphone,  anybody remember those?) its description of Persian pronunciation isn't right on the money either.  <br />The author's style of exposition is dense to the point of legalese.  Having worked my way through the book,  it still isn't clear to me when to use third-person singular verbs,  and when to use  third-person plural verbs,  when talking about a plural subject.  Does it depend which side of the bed you got out of this morning?  If it does,  say so!  There are some of us out here who aren't looking to read inscriptions on 2000-year old urns.  Some of us want to be able to talk to cabdrivers (especially when we go to their home country).<br />Finally,  and this is inexcusable:  No key to the exercises? If the publisher is not trying to sell this book to people trying to teach themselves the language,  why is it being sold in bookstores?  I purchased my copy in a bookstore in downtown San Francisco. What is an autodidact supposed to do?  Besides dialing out for pizza?	2001-10-23

It is certainly the most affordable course and  the easiest to obtain. From the very first lesson,  you get real sentences with real content instead of just formulas-  Hello,  Good morning,  how are you?- which is where so many language courses start.  So from the opening bell you can get a sense of how the language works and how sentences are put together.  The grammatical explanations are good,  although some of them could be more detailed.<br />Another feather in the author's cap is that the material on the tapes really does follow the book.  The speakers are quite easy to follow and one can get into the flow of the language very quickly.  I suppose you could buy the book without the tapes,  but would you feel very confident saying a words like &quot;t'ngai&quot; or &quot;g'baal&quot; for instance?  In a lot of language courses (including some in the &quot;Colloquial's&quot; series)  the material on the tapes does not coordinate well with the printed text.  This one does.<br />The major minus in this book is its system of transcription.  Given the choice between trying to represent Cambodian phonemes accurately (especially the vowels) and approximating what is now a very unphonetic system of writing,  the author has come up with system that does a poor job of both.  I  really believe that he should have used Huffman's system which is much more precise in representing phonemes that differ only very slightly to a Westerner's ear.  It would certainly help someone who also wants to consult Huffman's text. The author makes no bones about the fact that he wants to wean the learner away from transcription,  and he succeeds,  but mostly because his system is too inaccurate to be any help.   He does introduce the writing system gradually and there are illustrations in the book showing how the letters are handwritten- which is another feature not every language book has when there is a writing systemdifferent from our own.  <br />So- I'll give it four stars.  I'd give five stars to a future edition if the author found a better solution to his transcription problems.	2001-07-23

Otherwise it is so sloppily written and disorganized as to be unusable.  Not only do words appear in the exercises that are not in the glossary in back,  there are English to Greek exercises where the necessary Greek words have not been provided. More than once an English-to-Greek translation requires a grammatical construction (i.e., different case endings or different tense/mood) that has  not been introduced. The tapes devote about four times as much airtime as necessary to the Greek alphabet (which is not at all difficult to learn) before they, too, wander off into the ozone. Many important questions of usage and grammar are dismissed as being &quot;beyond the scope of this book.&quot;  Almost anything beyond the Greek alphabet seems to be beyond the scope of this book.<br />I know this is harsh, but this book could be a real confidence-destroyer for some who hasn't had much experience with  languages.	2001-04-02

It offers an ample vocabulary,  lots of good exercises, (with a key in the back) and its explanations of Hindi grammar are extremely lucid and well-presented.  The section on pronunciation is quite thorough,  although (as at least one other reviewer has previously remarked) the section on vowels gives British English rather than American English approximations.  The only way out of that difficulty of course, is to get the tapes,  which anyone learning a new language by themself should do anyway.<br />The one thing that I thought was lacking when I started using this book was a section that showed how Devanagari is actually written by hand.  Two other books on Indian languages in the same series do show handwritten characters (Bengali,  by Radice,  and Gujarati,  by Dwyer).  However within the last year,  one of the authors of this book (Snell) has published a little book devoted to the Devanagari script that does show how to form the letters.  It would make a worthwhile companion volume.	2001-03-28

Its vocabulary is the most useful for a beginning (and intermediate student), its explanations of both pronunciation and grammar are extremely well organized and easy to follow,  and there are many excellent exercises and drills.  Although this book quite clearly was originally intended to be used in a classroom setting,  it is not difficult to adapt the exercises for self-study- since there is usually Cantonese on one side,  and English on the other,  just cover up one side- then,  later on,  review by doing it the other way around.<br />Two negatives:  First,  the book should be sold with tapes.  There are other courses on the market which have audio support,  so if you also have one of these,  you can learn Cantonese pronunciation from them while using this course.  &quot;Colloquial Cantonese&quot; (from Routledge) is a particularly good fit because it uses basically the same system of transcription found in &quot;Cantonese Basic Course&quot;. Otherwise,  the help of a native speaker will be needed,  and from my own experience,  many native speakers will be baffled by the transcription (which was originally developed at Yale). Second,  the original State Department Course from which this was taken had thirty lessons,  but this edition includes only the first fifteen.  I would certainly give this book more stars if it contained the full course of thirty lessons.	2001-02-28

You open the book to the beginning section,  and in the first lessons there are whole sections with Hmong only- no English.  Remember,  the title of this book is &quot;Hmong for Beginners.&quot;  There are some pictures, with Hmong words underneath, but you can't look up the Hmong in the back because the only glossary the book has is English to Hmong.  So you guess at what the picture is (in English) and look it up in back.  If you're right,  good job- you learned a new Hmong word.  You have,  that is,  if the English word is listed in the English-Hmong glossary.  There is a grammatical section in the back,  with some not-too-bad explanations of Hmong grammar,  including some interesting comparisons to other languages,  interspersed with some more show-and-tell picture games,  but the  grammatical section is not correlated with any of the lessons in the front half of the book.  Do I need to say any more?  Well,  the tape is lousy too- the quality is so poor that in many cases one can't distinguish the different tones (and since Hmong has eight tones,  being able to distinguish between different tones is of fundamental importance).<br />What is a truly a shame about this is that Hmong is a language of extraordinary interest and is a window on a fascinating and little known culture.  Hopefully,  in the future someone with sufficient knowledge of (and appreciation for) the language will offer a more professional (and usable)presentation.	2001-02-10

I certainly recommend it as a good place to start for anyone interested in keeping this beautiful language alive (and it is also is a good point of departure for anyone interested in Polynesian languages in general.)  Each lesson begins with a section of sentences that introduce new grammatical patterns as well as new vocabulary,  and at the end of each lesson each pattern and each usage is explained very thoroughly.  The lessons progress from each one to the next very smoothly.  Many of the exercises and drills are clearly intended to be done in a classroom setting,  but it isn't too difficult to adapt them to home use.	2001-02-06

The authors have done a wonderful job of conveying what devotees of Cantonese (like this reviewer) love most about the language- its vigor and its humor.  The tapes are very good to work from,  also- the dialogues of the first two lessons are given in what might be called &quot;classroom speed&quot; and then as in the real world so that it's a gentle way for a beginner to get a &quot;feel&quot; for how Cantonese sounds without losing any self-confidence.  There are lots of good exercises with each lesson,  also,  and the review lessons really do review.<br />I cannot help but complain about one thing,  however.  The authors have invented a system of transcription that (for me at least) was difficult to learn,  confusing,  and totally different from any other Romanization of Cantonese that I've ever seen.  I don't have any great feelings of loyalty to the Huang-Kok romanization (I'll spend the rest of my life trying to undo the damage by Huang's &quot;Speak Cantonese&quot;, Books 2 and 3) but it is in wide use, it's not difficult to pick up,  and most of the other books and courses about Cantonese use it (including the good ones).  Going back and forth between different systems of transcription is one of the banes of the life of a student of Asian languages,  but up until now it is not a problem that most learners of Cantonese have had to deal with.  Even though this is a very complete, self-contained beginning course,  it's always helpful to cross-reference and compare other material.  What were you thinking of, guys?	2001-02-06

There is one good thing that can be said about it:  It does offer a decent method of learning to read Persian words.  The half of the book deals with the alphabet,  introducing a few letters with each lesson,  and with it some words and short easy sentences,  so that you can complete half the book and feel you're getting somewhere.<br />Unfortunately,  the author doesn't stop there.  The remaining lessons are poorly organized,  full of misprints,  and there are a number of reading sections where words are used that are not defined either within the lessons or in the glossary in the back. There was one lesson where I simply had to give up- there were too many words that were nowhere to be found anywhere else. The quality of printing is poor. The book is no help in developing conversational skills.  It does not come close to how speakers actually use the language in real life.  (I still can't say things like: &quot;Where do I get the bus?&quot;  &quot;How are the wife and kids?&quot;  There is no tape to go with it,  and when I've actually heard the language,  I must say that the author's descriptions of  how the sounds are made are not much like the way it sounds.<br />Finally,  this is an old book,  and it's hard for me to imagine that with everything else in Iran that has changed since it was published,  that some of those changes aren't reflected in the language.<br />In recent years there have been many new books in the Teach Yourself Series to replace older,  out-of-date ones.  Even the title of this one is out of date:  The correct name of the language is Farsi.	2001-01-16

It (and its predecessor) are the best sources I've seen as far as really explaining how Cantonese works.  There has been some other good material published in recent years for Cantonese learners (I give high marks to  &quot;Colloquial Cantonese&quot; by Tong and James and &quot;Teach Yourself Cantonese&quot; by Baker and Ho) but this is the best treatment of Cantonese syntax I've come across- having worked through it I now feel confident that I can speak good,  authentic Cantonese. It is written from a linguistic point of view but it is so well-organized and the material is so neatly presented that even someone without much linguistic background would find it a help. There are some comparisons made with Mandarin usage which are interesting and helpful to someone who learned Mandarin first (as I did) but previous knowledge of Mandarin is not assumed or required. A further plus:  Lots of contemporary vocabulary.

This isn't an easy language so it is very slow going (or it was for me,  anyway).  The tapes provide indispensable practice in listening as well as making sounds that don't exist even in other Semitic languages.  A couple of suggestions for making the book a five star book:  First,  include a section that shows how to hand-write the Amharic syllables.  I still feel very awkward writing Amharic although I've been at it for quite a while.  Also,  I would like it if in the glossary in back there was a Roman transliteration as well as Amharic.  I don't want to be dependent on romanization (and it certainly isn't necessary) but in many cases there are geminate (doubled) consonants in the middle of words,  which isn't shown in the native writing system.  A transcription would be a help in insuring correct pronunciation.	2000-10-29

I like this book very much.  Hausa is definitely an underappreciated and underrepresented language.  A great deal of Hausa scholarship is evident in the book and a real feeling for the people and the culture.  The section on pronunciation is particularly valuable.  Grammar and syntax are dealt with very clearly and very thoroughly.  My one criticism of this book is that it needs audio support (read: tapes and/or CD).  Although the explanation of the sounds of the tonal and intonational contours of Hausa is good,  there really is no substitute for hearing it.  The UCLA Hausa page will help a lot with learning to make the individual sounds (if you have sound files,  of course) but there's no substitute for hearing spoken dialogues. I hope that there will be a new edition of this book which includes audiotapes.	2000-10-03

Much of the material is well-presented,  but too many words are used in the exercises (and in the dialogues of each lesson) that do not turn up in the glossary in the back.  I find the book really heavy going even with a dictionary.  Some of the grammatical explanations are good,  but there are many idiomatic usages in the lessons and no real guidance of how to use them.  Even after working through the book and tapes I don't feel at all confident in even simple conversation.  Coverage of phonics is very skimply and the differences between different phonemes are not explained. The recorded dialogues on the tapes are spoken very fast and are extremely difficult to follow.  I feel that the author could have used much more input from would-be users-  a book that purports to be a &quot;teach yourself book&quot; should be much more self-contained. It should not be necessary so often for the user of it to have to consult outside references.	2000-10-03

It has probably the clearest explanation of Tamil pronunciation  that I have seen.  It is particularly good in explaining the characteristic  liquids and nasals,  the differences between which seem very small to a  Western ear.  I actually managed to teach myself a pronunciation which was  recognizable to a Tamil speaker when I found one to try it out on.  The  explanation of homorganic consonant assimilations  (a tricky and complex  subject) was also given very clearly.  It would be reaching pretty far to  call Tamil a phonetic language but using this book I was able to become  intelligent about the likely pronunciations of individual words.<br />Tamil  grammar is also very clearly presented,  and the lessons build on each  other in a very logical order.  The author of the book took a great deal of  trouble in composing exercises which actually reflected the content and  goals of each lesson (something many more contemporary authors of other  books on languages I've used have  not done).  There is supposed to be  another book available which gives an answer key to the exercises which I  would recommend buying.  I muddled along without one (not knowing it was  available when I used this book) but I will plan to get it for myself and  review it as soon as I've used it.<br />The downside of this book (and not the  author's fault by any means!) is that it dates from the nineteenth century.   The author was a missionary in South India and clearly was a man with a  great respect for the Tamil and Telugu languages and the culture of South  India.  His feeling for the language comes through very clearly in his  writing.  That being said,  however,  it is not the book to get if you're  looking to converse with your Tamil cabdriver.  If there is such a book,   I'd love to hear about it.	2000-09-02

A student will certainly learn enough from this book (WITH  the accompanying tape) to get around Shanghai and cope with every day  situations (which is all I really hoped for).  The  system of transcription  the book uses for the phonics is very nonstandard and difficult to use and  so is its way of representing the tones.  Also,  the grammatical coverage  is pretty sketchy and presupposes (perhaps not unreasonably) that the  student will also have some prior experience of learning Mandarin.  The  lessons are given as short dialogues,  and following each lesson is a large  supplementary vocabulary that you can plug into the sentence patterns that  are shown in the dialogue.  I would have liked it better if the author had  included some exercises and an answer key (and I would have rated the book  higher).  This is a little bit too do-it-yourself for the only book on the  subject.  Still,  it is a highly usable text  within that limitation.  Two  musts for the learner:  First,  the time spent mastering the system of  transcription will not be wasted (indeed,  you really need to over-learn  it).  Second,  don't even think about buying the book without the tapes.   That holds true for any language,  but nowhere more so than in learning any  form of Chinese.	2000-09-02

Too many language books published nowadays  are full of fluff about the culture of the country,  and other extraneous  material that you could get elsewhere,  and that frequently comes at the  expense of space that could be used to elucidate difficult or obscure parts  of the language (in the case of a couple of books I have,  it comes at the  expense of glossing some of the words in the text material).  This is a  very good,  businesslike job that sticks to the basics,  gives the learner  a lot of useful, everyday vocabulary,  and it is arranged in a format that  is extremely easy to use.  There are many good exercises,  WITH answers.   This book was originally used in State Department courses and it is one of  the most practical and approachable texts I have for any language.<br />Two  things missing,  though,  would make it better (and that is why I am only  giving it three stars).  First,  tapes:  Many sounds of Lao do not exist in  English,  and some are only approximately similar.  Lao is,  of course,  a  tonal language and so the need for good audio support should be obvious.   Since Lao is similar to Thai (and I do have audio materials for Thai) I've  been plugging Thai pronunciation into the Lao sounds.  It's the best I've  been able to do,  but it's an unsound practice.  <br />Also,  the Lao writing  is not covered.  I have yet to meet a Laotian in my area (and there are  some) who can recognize the romanization of Lao that this book uses,  so it  is hard to get help with pronunciation when I'm particularly unsure of it.   Some of them would be able to help me if the all the sentences in the  lessons were written in the alphabet that they knew.  Also,  why not just  teach the writing as part of the course? I have excellent books on  Cambodian and Thai that teach those alphabets (as an integrated part of the  course) and yet they are not huge or difficult books.	2000-09-01

I fell in love with the language when I  first heard it.  One thing couldn't be emphasized strongly enough:  Get the  tapes.  The click sounds of Zulu are probably what are best known to  outsiders,  but in the way of difficult sounds there is much,  much more.   I do think that the authors could perhaps have done a little more than they  did to explain how the non-click sounds are articulated;  their comment  that &quot;hl&quot; is like the &quot;ll&quot; in Welsh would probably be a  big help if I lived in Wales,  but I don't.  Still,  with a lot of practice  with the tapes,  I can make most of these sounds pretty well.  My advice  would be to listen to the tapes quite a few times before trying to imitate  the sounds- that and don't give up easily.<br />The grammatical material is  extremely well presented.  The structure of Zulu is of course completely  different from any European language,  but even in the first lesson  (devoted to greetings) one gets a good idea of what noun concords are and  how they work.  Zulu is perhaps a little unusual in that respect because  greetings in most languages don't lend themselves nearly that well to  analysis.  Getting a deep look at the structure of the language just in  phrases like &quot;How are you?&quot; and &quot;How is it with you?&quot;  was really fun and exciting.<br />I hope that there will be sufficient  interest generated from this book that the authors would consider writing a  sequel.  I would await it eagerly!	2000-09-01
