Per p. 17: \\"Although the social environment has changed since the Buddha's time, basic human nature has not\\" & p. 305: \\"The Buddha's advice is not rigid dogma, but has various meanings & methods of implementation according to the person & the circumstances.\\"  Ven. Wu Yin provides numerous examples relating directly to the precepts, reminiscent of Knowledge Management's dictum that knowledge = information in context.  Indeed, she categorizes & summarizes the precepts, converting the data into information that can be readily assimilated.  Further, she identifies precepts whose wording may be confusing--p. 292: \\"In this precept & the precept prohibiting Bhikshunis from eating garlic, the linguistic formulation of the precept does not express its meaning directly\\" & those that have been adapted to social contexts (pp. 172-9: living alone; swimming, sleeveless shirts, robe colors, etc.).  The historical context pp. 190, 284, & 291 demonstrates that precepts respond to the law of the land.  While only one difference between Theravada & Mahayana is given (p. 294: \\"learner in prajika\\" is Mahayana Only), the book is not meant to be all inclusive.  She does demonstrate how advanced the Buddha's thinking was (e.g. pp. 308-10: disputes/conflict resolution-even including arbitration).  While there are precepts that differ for men & women (e.g. p. 144: Bhikshus can be ordained 7 times, but Bhikshunis only once), the Buddha advanced gender equality overall, saying p. 312 of the 1st Bhikshuni upon her death: \\"This Bhikshuni has fulfilled the meaning of being a great human being.\\"  As Ven. Wu Yin ably points out, \\"Being a great human being is not related to gender; it depends on caring about the well-being of all our fellow sentient beings.\\"inking was (e.g. pp. 308-10: disputes/conflict resolution-even including arbitration).

US	30672120	RMQ77OI3I0PHT	0937938661	304176637	Buddha Mind: An Anthology of Longchen Rabjam's Writings on Dzogpa Chenpo	Books	5	14	15	N	Y	Deep Text, nice selection	This is the same book as \\"The Practice of Dzogchen\\" previously released in both paperback (no longer available) and hardback.  There are lots of introductory Dzogchen books (as there are for Mahamudra, Kabbalah, etc.) and a number of mid-level ones too. This is NOT one of them. There are also pure scholarly works with a small, fervent readership. This isn't one of those either, though scholars may certainly find it very valuable. The commentator/translator excerpts from many of Longchenpa's (Longchen Rabjam's, 1308-63) various texts which are impossible to access in English otherwise. Longchenpa is one of, if not THE, greatest Dzogchen masters of all time. Nevertheless, this is not an easy text to read. Furthermore, it is inconsistent in depth & style (since it's really a set of excerpts). However, this is a definitive Dzogchen text--quite advanced, not for the beginner, challenging, & enlightening. It grows with you and re-reading texts in an unfamiliar area can increase understanding and familiarity (the way Jung studied Alchemy). This is a GREAT book, not to be underrated, but not every book is for every one. IMHO it would be better to read Longchenpa's \\"Kindly Bent to Ease Us\\" trilogy before attempting this one. It's a much easier read.  Also, I'd recommend reading some Tulku Urgyen, Namkhai Norbu, & Drubwang Tsoknyi Rinpoche books before takling this one. <br />	2005-08-06

Thus, he differentiates between soul work & spiritual work, stating that the West is pioneering new possibilities through the personal (individuation) & the interpersonal (e.g. intimate relationships).  He has fine observations On Thoughts: p. 31: \\"Our thoughts act as a kind of glue that holds our identity structure together\\" & p. 190: we get \\"hijacked by our thoughts\\" On Love: p. 251: \\"Unconditional love does not imply that a relationship must take a particular form.

His differencing of \\"submit\\" & \\"surrender\\" isn't in Websters, he fails to note that complementary psychological & spiritual work resembles a yin-yang balancing, & his \\"meditation\\" means Shamatha, not Vipashyana.

The entire series is chronological.  In this book, Harry is approaching his 17th birthday-the time of wizard adulthood.  The characters reflect their ages, and thus their maturing processes, during the series.  Up to now, Harry has been a child growing into adolescence.  Thus, he's been protected in many ways though he's also had extreme trials.  But now he's poised to enter adulthood in which he is no longer under another's wings.  This book prepares him for that development.  It also shows him how his arch enemy developed into \\"maturity\\" in a dark manner-unlike his own.  Such information may prove invaluable in his future, predicted conflict with Voldemort.  As usual, Ms. Rowling laces her novel with humor (I often laughed out loud), mystery (who is the Prince?  Who's side is Snape really on?).  While her series depicts the archetypal conflict between good and evil, she is far more subtle as well-producing a many-layered tapestry of prose.  Even the Dark Lord and Draco Malfoy are shown to have shades of gray - and so does Harry.  Things are not as simple as they seem.  One wonders if a certain wizard had something special up his sleeve before his \\"untimely\\" departure-which doesn't at all seem untimely to me.  This was necessary for Harry's development as a protagonist.  Is this the Harcrux of the matter?<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how Rowling resolves the dichotomies in book 7 which may or may not be the end of the Harry Potter saga.  I suspect from her obvious talents that it will be synergistic rather than merely climax.  To my mind the most complex and interesting character is Snape.  Finally, we got a bit of his history as well as Tom Riddle's.  Snape is enigma incarnate.  We also got a better look at Ginny who fills a void in both Harry's life and in the cast-providing teenage girls with a very different paradigm than Hermione.  As with the characters, this book is a revelation of the past maturing into the present...as with adolescence, there is a marked qualitative difference in development from that of the past-which is absolutely necessary to achieve adulthood.  Ms. Rowling has moved from a great storyteller into a writer of literature-though of a particular niche.  But, whether you treasure this development or not, as with the prior HP books, it's a great read.

His thesis is that p. 8: \\"documented case after case of experienced meditators whose core conflicts & deficits have not only been inadequately addressed through their practice, but for whom meditation itself served to reinforce defensive patterns\\" which have led to a number of scandals for Zen leaders due to \\"Zen transference\\" & that Zen & psychotherapy can be mutually supportive/beneficial.  He is very oriented towards gradualism: Soto vs. Rinzai Zen, pro-bottom up vs. top-down approach, & thinks peak experiences are chimeras-despite Richard Bucke's famous book, \\"Cosmic Consciousness\\" which describes how such experiences have markedly changed numerous people's lives.  His view seems Extroverted (object relations, intersubjectivity, etc.) & Sensate (bottom-up/gradualist).  He does provide nice concise descriptions of Self Psychology etc. but makes no attempt to integrate them into extant models (e.g. Jung).  His  Intersubjectivity appears to be an interpretation of Knowledge Management social network analysis using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  The book has interesting explications of Zen koans & astute observations on important, often misunderstood, Buddhist doctrines: p. 95: quoting Aitkin Roshi--\\"The self is still present-but it is not self-preoccupied,\\" p. 141: \\"Suzuki Roshi once said that detachment doesn't mean giving up the things of the world, but accepting that they go away,\\" & p. 142: \\"Detachment means non-self-centered responsiveness to a situation...all detachment precludes is increasing the suffering of others in order to minimize your own.\\"  However, he seems to think p. 58: emptiness is perfection & Buddhahood is emptiness.  He virtually ignores Buddha nature, stating that: p. 162: \\"It is only through the skillful use of forms, discipline, & the relationship that liberating change can occur.  This is as true for psychoanalysis as it is for Zen.\\"  IMHO, this is not true for everyone--e.g. people have differing personality types per the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.  Thus, \\"doing by being\\" is comparable to \\"being by doing\\" & possibly more efficient.  The moral is not to run slowly, it's to pay attention--the hare lost to the tortoise because he wasn't mindful.

It centered on presentations on brain research, applicable to psychology, by Western scientists including ones utilizing Buddhist meditators.  Participants included the 14th Dalai Lama (DL), Theravada, & other Buddhists who explained relevant Buddhist psychology so that the group could compare/contrast Eastern & Western psychologies & explore bi-directional cross-pollination possibilities.  For example, a Thai monk described mindfulness practice.  The book also includes bios of presenters & some commentary by the author who attended the meeting.  Some differences highlighted in the book include the frequently-quoted instance of the DL not understanding the Western concept of self-loathing & similar expressions of self-disapproval, the Buddhist assumption that people are basically good (as opposed to original sin), that there is no Tibetan word for emotion, & that Western psychology is mostly aimed at eliminating negative psychological conditions whereas Buddhism is mostly aimed at creating positive psychological conditions.  However, some innovative Western research on a more positive vein was described such as Mark Greenberg's Paths program to educate children with social/emotional learning, which is now used in over 100 school districts in the US.  The DL asked him to institute it in the Tibetan Dharamsala community as well-which he agreed to do.  Tibetans described methods to generate positive emotions such as the 4 Immeasurables (loving kindness, empathetic joy, compassion, & equanimity), Tonglen (sending & receiving), visualization, etc.  Physiological contributions of scientists included use of the EEG, Functional MRI, PET scan, etc. in studies on locations of brain functioning, intra-brain interactions, etc. on such activities as meditation, smiling, positive/negative emotions, etc.  Some counter-intuitive findings included: \\"there is little correlation between one's life circumstances & one's moods.\\"  Perhaps the upshot of the conference was the DL's saying that: \\"Mental health is the best defense against destructive emotions\\" & his emphasis on developing a \\"healthy emotional immune system.\\"  The conference resulted in a number of research proposals (one of which the DL offered to support financially), follow-on studies, articles, educational efforts, & web sites-included in the book.  Perhaps the most hopeful indication from the Western research was their surprising finding of the neuroplasticity of the brain-that experiences & practices can change brain physiology.  While there is considerable valuable information herein, & it is well presented, the material is somewhat dry for the average reader & the appreciative audience possibly limited & of narrow focus.  Nevertheless, the open minded collaboration & interchange between Western scientists & Buddhist practitioners is extremely hopeful & is already bearing significant fruit.uded: \\"there is little correlation between one's life circumstances & one's moods.\\"  Perhaps the upshot of the conference was the DL's saying that: \\"Mental health is the best defense against destructive emotions\\" & his emphasis on developing a \\"healthy emotional immune system.\\"  The conference resulted in a number of research proposals (one of which the DL offered to support financially), follow-on studies, articles, educational efforts, & web sites-included in the book.

As the author states: pp. 191-2: \\"Cixous' work, like much of feminism, is directed at healing various kinds of internal divisions, especially those that separate women from their bodies, feelings, and female selves.\\"  But, the author argues convincingly for cultural/psychological differences between Tibetans & Westerners, even in childhood: p. 37: \\"In modern cultures, unlike traditional ones, the chasm between childhood & adulthood roles is enormous. The road to adulthood & personhood is marked by a range of choices unknown in traditional societies, & the individual's responsibility for those choices is great,\\" p. 40: \\"Although karmic theory emphasizes that actions and their effects accrue to particular persons, traditional Tibetans do not understand themselves as \\"individuals\\" in the contemporary Western social, economic, or psychological sense,\\"& p. 192: \\"for all their personal independence, traditional Buddhist practitioners are culturally, socially, and linguistically embedded in ways Westerners are not.\\"<br /><br /> In addition to such quotable statements, she addresses sociological/cultural issues: p. 195: \\"Buddhist traditions are famous for their ability both to change the cultures they visit and to be altered by them.  Yet when Buddhist thought and practices moved to Southeast Asia, or to China & then Korea & Japan, or to Tibet, they were part of a larger process of cultural exchange that extended over centuries.  Never until today has such a wealth and variety of Buddhist resources-texts, practices, & living teachers-been made available in so short a period of time to populations who are at the same time so ignorant of the cultures from which these traditions have come.\\"  Many of her observations are fresh & very discerning, & she uses story effectively; p. 196: \\"modern constructions of personhood are unique; they did not occur in the cultures that gave rise to Buddhism. The Japanese girl unable to name her favorite color-not trained in playing the individual's game of personal choices-reminds us of these differences.\\"  She has fine comparisons of Geluk Lamrim gradualism vs. Dzogchen immediacy/view, notes significant differences between Tibetan & Western practitioners (especially regarding Gurus)--p. 197: \\"personal and emotional expressions are vital to Westerners in ways they are not for traditional Buddhists...Buddhist theory & practice in the West must take account of the need for individuality, personal stories, & clear connectedness & support the expression of these\\" & describes Great Bliss Queen practice-though she seems unaware of Nathan Katz' work comparing dakinis & Jung's anima (e.g. in Meckel & Moore's \\"Self & Liberation: the Jung-Buddhist Dialogue\\").  Perhaps her finest contribution is toward balance & future collaboration: p. 193: \\"Among the most stimulating challenges for Western Buddhists is to find a way to integrate personal narratives  historical specificity into the nonconceptual universals considered the goals of much of Buddhist practice.

Of course, each person might choose differently, but the translators did a very creditable job.  They included the Heart Sutra, description of the Dyanai Buddhas, & various selections which document many important principles described or assumed in contemporary books such as: egolessness-- Satasahasrika XLV f. 119: \\"It is because of I-making & mine-making that beings run & wander in birth & death,\\" form--Mahaprajnaparamita, trans. Hsuan-tsang fasc. 532, ch 29 (I): \\"Form is nothing but holes & cracks,\\"  magical illusion-- Sikshasamuccaya 233-4 (Ratnakuta & Ratnacuda): \\"Thought is like a magical illusion...thought cannot review thought.  As the blade of a sword cannot cut itself, as a finger-tip cannot touch itself, so a thought cannot see itself,\\" duality--Satasahasrika LII, f. 279-83: \\"all dharmas are baseless...where there is duality, there is a basis,\\" & luminosity-- Satasahasrika III, 495-502: \\"original nature is a state of transparent luminosity.\\"  They also include more unusual material such as some Yogacara works, a different view of the time-existence of the Buddha--Saddharmapundarika XV, 268-72: Although the Tathagata has not entered Nirvana, he makes a show of entering Nirvana, for the sake of those who have to be educated...aeons must elapse before my life-span is complete,\\" & the remarkable Saraha, Dohakosha (Saraha's Treasury of Songs) which dismisses many still-prevalent Buddhist activities-- 13-5 \\"Will one gain release, abiding in meditation?  What's the use of lamps?  What's the use of offerings?  What's to be done by reliance on mantras?  Abandon such false attachments & renounce such illusion! ...Without meditating, without renouncing the world, One may stay at home in the company of one's wife.  Can that be called perfect knowledge, Saraha says, If one is not released while enjoying the pleasures of sense?\\"  In addition, David Snellgrove provides an excellent analysis of the Vimilakirti Sutra: \\"The fault in this plot is that it makes us expect too much from Vimalakirti's argumentative power...the actual quality of his discourse is not good enough.  We are left wondering why all the Saints stood in such awe of him.  The author of this sutra tries to make up for this defect by a series of flighty miraculous episodes, which serve only to enhance the general effect of triviality.\\"  Overall, the editors provide a fine, balanced overview of Buddhist literature & its development over the centuries.ilakirti Sutra: \\"The fault in this plot is that it makes us expect too much from Vimalakirti's argumentative power...the actual quality of his discourse is not good enough.

There isn't much new or profound but it might be good as a starter--on the other hand his very fine book \\"A Path with Heart\\" is much better.

Norbu says p. 89: \\"It is as though the Pope suddenly vomited insolently & uncontrollably in a cathedral, so I hastily had to clean it, as the Polish people asked me to do.\\"  The chapter is excerpted; readers cannot evaluate it sequentially or in toto but must rely on Norbu's discretion.  Norbu's book is organized topically, without a Table of Contents.  Its Chapters are:<br /><br />1. p. 3  Experience & Enlightenment<br /><br />2. p. 7  Evil, God, & Reality<br /><br />3. p. 20 Breaking Ties to Reality<br /><br />4. p. 38 Indifference, Detachment & Love<br /><br />5. p. 47 Atheism<br /><br />6. p. 51 Creation<br /><br />7. p. 58 Union<br /><br />8. p. 68 Mysticism<br /><br />9. p. 81 Religions<br /><br />The Pope says that Buddhism is negative, an escape from an evil world, but Norbu points out the Pope only addresses \\"Hinayana\\", ignoring Mahayana Bodhisattvas, the 4 Immeasurables, Vajrayana...so it's inaccurate, but despite Norbu's arguments, Hinayana does emphasize suffering & the Arhat ideal of escape or detachment from the world.  But even equating Buddhism with Hinayana, the Pope calling it atheistic is untrue--look it up in Websters.  Further, Norbu says p. 47: \\"If the Pope truly wants to love the world, he has to practice according to Mahayana & Vajrayana vehicles\\"-which seems a bit over the top--though his p. 72 comments on non-sectarianism are on the mark.  Also, as a scientist, I agree with Norbu's analysis of science & religion-Christians claiming credit for science is specious-Church persecutions of scientists (e.g. Galileo) & mystics (e.g. Roger Bacon, Cathars & Templars) are legion.  But, it is refreshing for a Pope to speak positively about mysticism.  Still, Norbu's Einstein quote (without a reference) is powerful: pp. 75-6 \\"The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion.  It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas & theology.  Covering both the natural & the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural & spiritual, as a meaningful unity.  Buddhism answers this description...If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs, it would be Buddhism.\\"  But science is based on empiricism not opinion (even from geniuses).  One cannot say if Norbu's correct p. 81 that the Pope \\"is trying to present a negative picture of Buddhism, as though he is afraid it has too much appeal & may draw his own followers away\\" as he's attributing motive to another-but it seems rational.  He's certainly right that p. 82 \\"It is unfair for the Pope to think he & his priests can go all over the world to convert people to their religion but some small number of Buddhists cannot.\\"  But one can question the motives of proselytizing by any religion.e based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural & spiritual, as a meaningful unity.

For example: p. 17: from \\"Subsequent Tantra of the Bathing Elephants\\"-\\"The mind essence of sentient beings is the luminous nature of self-awareness, the unfabricated awakened state, a continuity that is spontaneously present.  Once you embark on the path of ripening and liberating this luminous nature, you clearly perceive the fruition within your own being.\\"  The 1st ½ of the book addresses the nature of Tantric empowerment; I didn't find it applicable as it mostly reproaches people of his era (Middle Ages) though some may still apply: p. 61: \\"There are many meditators, but few who know how to meditate.\\"  But the 2nd ½ includes very rare & valuable teachings such as the limitations of Gampopa's \\"Jewel Ornament of Liberation\\"-now I know why I didn't really like this famed text!  He explains the differences in Madhyamaka & MM in depth, stating that: p. 71: \\"This creation of emptiness out of mere belief is the Middle Way of meditation.  It possesses the dualistic concepts of a meditator & an object of meditation.  One doesn't realize the view through that.  Because it counteracts the fixation of a concrete reality it can exhaust an immense amount of obscurations, but it cannot bring enlightenment.\\"  He also explains that rigid meditation requirements are not necessarily applicable to MM practitioners: p. 91: quoting Lord Kodragpa, \\"I, a yogi of Mahamudra, have no posture, gaze, or fixed attention.  I simply practice in whatever thought arises.\\"  The Glossary provides some data on the masters cited in the text.  Of course, the book must be read considering the Middle Age, Tibetan multi-school context.  Unlike most authors, Rangdr&ouml;l minces no words & deftly points out important differences in views & practices.  He is a heavy proponent of practice lineages vs. academic/rationalist approaches.

Overall, it's a very fine introduction to basic Buddhism & a terrific companion to Ven. Chodron's Q&A \\"Buddhism for Beginners\\" & \\"Working with Anger.\\"  While the author is a Gelugpa Tibetan Buddhist Bhikshuni (ordained nun), the book is more generic.  The pp. 25-80 psychology portion is convincing: e.g. p. 40: \\"The sources of the pain & confusion are our own biased projections & the selfish expectations we've placed on others,\\" but goes a bit far, stating p. 77: \\"all problems arise from the self-cherishing attitude.\\"  Later sections present std. Buddhist doctrines, dogmas, mythology, & terminology-very different from the psychology section.  For example, as I read Websters, \\"kindness\\" implies intention; while one can be grateful to another for some benefit, an unintended benefit is not a \\"kindness.\\"  Similarly, p. 161 the discourse on emptiness ignores the mixed definition of \\"cracker\\"--Websters says it must be baked, it is not simply the sum of its parts + synergy is possible.  She has some questionable (though not unusual) assumptions-saying p. 196 there were no Buddhist wars (but the Gelugpas came to power over the Karmapa via Mongol military strength etc.).  The discussion on soul/self is also party line e.g. p. 163: \\"the Judeo-Christian idea of an eternal, unchanging soul\\" & p. 166: \\"the self still exists, but in a gentler & softer way.  It's merely a convention, not a real entity.\\"  IMO it depends on one's definitions of words used.  This basic book doesn't address specific Vajrayana or Mahamudra perspectives, but Ven. Chodron says very valuable things when speaking for herself: p. 206: \\"Others may not be our relatives, but they are someone's parents & children.  They are the same in being parents & children, only the possessive pronoun describing them is different: `their' instead of `our.'  Once we recognize the arbitrariness of these labels `mine' & `others,' our love & compassion can spread to everyone impartially.  In this way, feelings of alienation & barriers between people fall away.\\"  I find this observation very useful in developing lovingkindness, compassion, Bodhichitta & Tonglen & p. 209: per Lama Yeshe, \\"We do whatever we can, with whatever wisdom we have...to the best of our ability.  This in itself will be of enormous benefit to others; we don't need to wait until we become Buddhas before we can begin to act.\\"They are the same in being parents & children, only the possessive pronoun describing them is different: `their' instead of `our.'

It has 3 parts: Jung's Commentaries on Tibetan Buddhist texts, his meeting with a Zen expert, & 9 articles by contemporary authors on Jung-Buddhist issues.  It is bi-directional, addressing both Jung's contributions to Buddhism & vice versa.  Some of the authors have published valuable books too-Radmila Moacanin, Nathan Katz, & Harold Coward.  Jung said: p. 49: \\"Matter is an hypothesis.  When you say `matter' you are really creating a symbol for something unknown, which may just as well be `spirit' or anything else; it may even be \\"God,\\" p. 76: \\"close parallelism between the findings of Eastern & Western psychology,\\" & p. 83: \\"The Bardo Th&ouml;dol is in the highest degree psychological in its outlook.\\"  The book addresses mostly Zen & Vajrayana Buddhism & Jung, though there is a bit on Freud too.  Nathan Katz says: p. 324: in \\"Dakini & Anima...\\"-\\"a paradigm for comparative religion-psychological study which neither reduces one perspective to another, nor sees the discourses of Buddhist & Jungian psychology as rigidly & artificially compartmentalized.\\"  This relates to virtually the entire book.  As James Thomas states: p. 221: \\"The language of both Jung & Buddhism is a study in elaborate avoidance of metaphysics.  The language of both strives to be purely empirical.\\"<br /><br />The book also addresses Jung-Buddhist differences: p. 183: Mokusen Miyuki in \\"Self-Realization in the 10 Oxherding Pictures,\\" \\"The Eastern concept of `mind' is radically different from that in the West.\\"  Quoting Jung, \\"In the West, `mind' is more or less equated with consciousness, whereas in the East the word `mind' is closer to what the West refers to as the unconscious...Our study, employing Jung's concepts & methodology, has afforded us a psychological understanding of Zen satori (enlightenment) in terms of self-realization, or the urge of the Self to realize itself.\\"  And since the U.S. is considered ESTJ (Extroverted/Sensate/Thinker/Judgmental) & Tibet seems opposite in psychological type & Westerners go down into the unconscious (& Kabbalists go down to the Chariot) while Easterners rise up to their Buddha nature, Jung suggested Westerners read the Bardo Th&ouml;dol backwards.  Also, p. 163: Thomas Kasulis, says \\"The Zen Buddhist view of the person goes beyond the more restricted psychoanalytic categories of Freud & Jung.\\"  Interestingly, the Pu-ming oxherding pictures remind me of the Tibetan Path of Shamatha in Kalu Rinpoche's \\"Luminous Mind\\" or Dzogchen Ponlop's stages of resting in \\"Wild Awakening.\\"  But the largest difference is in the view of the final stage of enlightenment vs. individuation-Self-centered vs. ego-centered people-whether the Self can be \\"conscious\\" without the ego.  IMHO this is a matter of conceptual definitions-& it reminds me of Casteneda's 2nd Attention with which Jung was unfamiliar.osite in psychological type & Westerners go down into the unconscious (& Kabbalists go down to the Chariot) while Easterners rise up to their Buddha nature, Jung suggested Westerners read the Bardo Thdol backwards.

It is introductory...My sense in presenting the teachings of Buddhism & Yoga was that the reader would be new to them, to their radical emphasis on self-transformation.\\"  It also has some comparisons with certain Western psychologies & concludes with a section on anger.  Rather than a scholarly work, it is conversational & replete with stories, anecdotes, poems, etc.  It is very basic & easy reading.  The 1st section concerns Southern (often called Hinayana-which is derogatory) Buddhism (though the book includes some Zen stories).  The 2nd section is on Hindu Yoga (e. g. Patanjali) & seems more detailed, including original drawings of mental processes.  It's heavily Hatha Yoga, & ignores Raja Yoga entirely.  The 3rd section is on cognitive & behavioral psychology-unlike many current works relating Eastern psychology to psychoanalysis, analytical psychology, etc.-even the bibliography ignores such works.  The 4th section is on using these 3 to control anger.  For a Buddhist view on anger, see Thubten Chodron's fine \\"Working with Anger.\\"  The most interesting items to me were: p. 77: Escher's poem \\"Transcending,\\" yoga described as similar to mindfulness (& to me Zen), p. 132 table 24.1 & preceding pages mapping yoga angas to Buddha's 8-fold path, p. 151 \\"problem-solving therapy\\" though Deborah Tannen might categorize it as a masculine approach, & p. 177 the five stages of anger (most interestingly stage 4: \\"there is no anger\\" is lower than stage 5: \\"anger is the servant.\\"  I don't think these 2 are serial, but I agree with the order.  Perhaps the most profound yet congruent observation was: p. 193: \\"The man who is angry at you or who yells at you, doesn't see you but sees his own conception of you.\\"  I think Mahayana Buddhists would even go farther & point out that we are all aggregates (which our author does indeed directly imply in his many examples) of innumerable influences.  Still, there is the sticky issue of free will to consider.  This is a fun book with some valuable insights, but as the author states, it is introductory.

But actually Buddhism is about diving into your real issues and fearlessly befriending the difficult and blocked areas and deep-seated habitual patterns that keep us stuck in ignorance and confusion...Buddhism can definitely work with people's real issues, it can be an enormously powerful tool & maybe work in balance with psychotherapy.  But if it comes to making Buddhism into psychotherapy, then we risk losing a sense of vast mind and timelessness...of making the mind available to insights that just completely cut the root of confusion.  & psychotherapy doesn't do that.\\"	2005-06-02

It includes interesting case/client data/histories & has an interesting structure-especially the chapters arranged by six worlds--though the mapping seems a bit contrived.  As stated by the Dalai Lama: p. x: \\"There is increasing evidence the Buddhist assertions & modern findings have the potential to be valuable to one another.\\"  The author is a Buddhist psychotherapist (based on Freud, Winnicott, et al), but he reveals the limitations of this approach: p. 160: quoting Winnicott: \\"absence of psychoneurotic illness may be health, but it is not life.\\"  p. 180: \\"the frustrating inability of psychotherapy to move beyond recognition and reconciliation to the far shore of relief.\\"  p. 183: \\"Freud strove to make his patients less unaware, whereas the Buddha taught his students how to become more aware.\\"  Maslow, Herzberg, Jung, etc. do not share this difficulty (see .Moacanin's \\"The Essence of Jung's Psychology & Tibetan Buddhism\\").  This greatly limits the book--Freudian psychoanalysis has far smaller scope than Buddhism.  However, there are areas in which each might support the other-especially with Western practitioners.  p. 30-1: \\"the existence of inner feelings of emptiness & unworthiness in the Western psyche has seemed all but unbelievable to teachers raised in the East...so the Western student afflicted with such feelings must make emptiness itself the object of his or her meditation.  Only then can self-loathing be transformed into wisdom.\\"  This parallels Suzuki Roshi's metaphor p. 127: \\"Mind Weeds-pulling out the weeds we give nourishment to the plant.  We pull the weeds and bury them near the plant to give it nourishment.\\"  For example, the well-known Tibetan Buddhist technique to develop compassion-to view everyone as your mother--doesn't work well for many Westerners (with Mother complex problems), but the Tibetans CAN adapt their Buddhist techniques to the West: p. 176: Sogyal Rinpoche: [it's]\\"not for Westerners, I always tell them like your grandmother or grandfather... [in Tibet] a positive sense of self is assumed.\\"  Thus, Epstein concludes: p. 135: \\"Meditation, on its own, is not particularly effective at solving people's emotional problems.\\"  Herzberg's two-factor theory explains this.  He argues that there is a qualitative difference between a negative state & a neutral state [psychoanalysis] on one hand & the difference between a neutral state & a positive state [Buddhism] on the other hand.  This book is worth reading but there are others with wider scope such as Seth Robert Segall's \\"Encountering Buddhism: Western Psychology & Buddhist Teachings.\\": p. 176: Sogyal Rinpoche: [it's]\\"not for Westerners, I always tell them like your grandmother or grandfather...

While the authors discuss similarities & differences between these 2, the main thrust is complementary nature so that they can be mutually supportive.<br /><br />A.  BUDDHIST MEDITATION CAN HELP BOTH THERAPIST & CLIENT:<br /><br />p. 175: Segall, \\"Psychotherapy Practice as Buddhist Practice\\": \\"Buddhist practice may be an important vehicle for developing emotional skills that are vital for the practice of psychotherapy, but are harder to teach...In the last half-century there has been a growing appreciation for the relevance of many of Buddhism's core concepts and practices to the practice of psychotherapy.\\"<br /><br />B.  BUDDHIST APPROACHES CAN HELP FILL IN GAPS INHERENT IN PSYCHOTHERAPY:<br /><br />p. 49: Jeffery Rubin, \\"Close Encounters of a New Kind\\" \\"The trace of the tragic psychology of illness in psychoanalysis emerges implicitly in its neglect of such topics as creativity, spirituality, and optimal mental and physical health.  The psychoanalytic view of health is, according to Buddhism, a suboptimal state of being; an arrested state of development.  Buddhism can challenge the limitations of a psychoanalytic view of self that is excessively self-centered and restrictive.\\"<br /><br />C.  CORRESPONDINGLY, PSYCHOANALYSIS CAN HELP WESTERNERS PRACTICING BUDDHISM:<br /><br />p. 48: Rubin, \\"Psychoanalysis can help Buddhists detect where they neglect unconsciousness and are being self-deceptive-where, for example, self-abasement in a Buddhist meditator can masquerade as spiritual asceticism.\\"<br /><br />D.  BALANCED VIEW: BUDDHIST MIDDLE WAY/ARISTOTLE'S GOLDEN MEAN vs. EXTREMISM:<br /><br />p. 35: Rubin-\\"Eurocentrism refers to the intellectually imperialistic tendency in much Western scholarship to assume that European and North American standards and values are the center of the moral and intellectual universe.\\"  & p. 39: \\"Orientocentrism...the mirror opposite danger to Eurocentrism: the idealizing and privileging of Asian thought-treating it as sacred-and the neglect if not dismissal of the value of Western psychological perspectives.\\"<br /><br />E.  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EASTERN & WESTERN MENTALITIES MUST BE CONSIDERED:<br /><br />p. 58 note 4: Rubin: \\"The Dalai Lama was shocked to hear that Americans suffered from \\"self-directed contempt\\" (p. 196). He told a group of American scientists and mental health professionals that this experience was absent from Tibetan culture\\"<br /><br />p. 152: Robert Rosenbaum, Reflections on Mirroring\\"--\\"As the bumper sticker on my daughter's car says, \\"Always remember you're unique, just like everybody else.\\" Buddhism does not deny the existence of a personal, relativistic ego, but it does deny it any permanent, static qualities.\\"<br /><br />F.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME PROFOUND OBSERVATIONS & VALUABLE METAPHORS:<br /><br />p. 83: Segall, \\"On Being a Non-Buddhist Buddhist\\"--\\"I think we are very much like a whirlpool (Beck, 1993) in the ocean. We can identify and point to the whirlpool as a \\"separate\\" entity that we can observe.  It is a pattern of energy and matter that emerges for a time, persists for a time, and then dissolves, much like ourselves. But the water of the whirlpool is not separate from the sea. The water in the whirlpool at one point in time is not the same water that is in the whirlpool at another point in time.\\"<br /><br />p. 155-6: Rosenbaum: \\"We are all constantly breaking into 100's of 1000's of pieces.  Studying the pieces of the mirror is the mirror.  When we study ourselves, we become the mirror facing the mirror.  When we study ourselves in the presence of another person, two mirrors face themselves & face each other: we meet in mirroring.  Each fragment of our experience is a clear mirror, is our entire life.  Each piece is a whole; that whole is no different, in its wholeness, from this whole.  This is complete realization... Enlightenment is simply an unburdening of all the accretions of thought, of preconceptions, of sense distortions, of preferential feelings that obscure reality; enlightenment is simply the manifestation of that which is.\\"<br /><br />G.  SUMMARY--This is a very fine book.  It would be interesting to see how they would react to Mahamudra or Dzogchen.  Also, while I like their whirlpool and mirror analogies, they might also consider bar magnets or holograms in which the parts include the whole & the whole includes the parts.of preconceptions, of sense distortions, of preferential feelings that obscure reality; enlightenment is simply the manifestation of that which is.\\" <br />G.

It is evident how much Buddhism means to her.  She's been included in a number of anthologies (e.g. by Bhikshuni Lekshe Tsomo).  The title is from the Maha Paranibbana Sutta: \\"abide as an island...loving the Dhamma as an island & refuge.\\"  Per Theravada, she uses Pali spellings vs. Sanskrit equivalents.

She is the daughter of a tulku (reincarnated lama) and is supposed to be one herself.  I read 2/3 of the book and then (amazingly) lost it.  So, I'm giving some benefit of the doubt.  I wouldn't be rating it, but the prior reviews for both hard & softback versions seem overly generous to me--I believe in balance.  The material here is VERY elementary though the author's style is quite easy to follow.  It has IMHO a somewhat lukewarm foreward by the Dalai Lama too.  The material is basic to Buddhism but not, at least to me, very enlightening.  There are many female Buddhist authors (Pema Chodron, Thubten Chodron, Ayya Khema, etc.) who publish books with more knowledge, practicality, and even wisdom.  Still, this book might serve as a low-key introduction to Buddhism.  But, I'd probably recommend Thubten Chodron's \\"Buddhism for Beginners.\\"  Of course, it's possible the last 1/3 of this book is exceptional.  But, I doubt it.  The book does have an extensive description of the 6 worlds; it's hard to say if the author takes them literally or not.  I do not.  I believe it was Shantideva who asked--who could have built the iron halls of hell (or something like that).  In any case, if you are looking more for a \\"feel\\" of Buddhism in light reading, this book might just be for you.  If so, enjoy.  Different strokes for different folks.	2005-05-24
US	30672120	R23HCGL4H9SVF1	088706051X	58678590	Jung and Eastern Thought (Suny Series, Transpersonal & Humanistic Psychology)	Books	5	16	17	N	N	Excellent comparison of Jung mostly with Hindu thought	This is a well-written book balancing Jungian & Eastern thought in an unbiased manner-both similarities & differences.  It covers yoga (Patanjali's)/Taoism; alchemy/Gnosticism, the collective unconscious=Self/ Brahman, synchronicity; mandalas/quaternity/circumambulation, karma/reincarnation, prana/libido/prajna, & Upanishads/kundalini.  It has general topics & a very detailed comparison of Jung/Patanjali's yoga with considerable discussion of the Upanishads.  Thus, it focuses mainly on Hinduism.  There are a great many parallels, if not identities, between numerous concepts & views: p. 5: quoting Jung: \\"Taoist philosophy as well as yoga have very many parallels with the psychic processes we can observe in Western man.\\"  Perhaps the main similarities lie in the extensive comparisons of Jung's libido vs. yoga's prana, self-knowledge & prajna, mandalas & circumambulation as symbols of wholeness/Self, the relationship between the self & the All, & yoga vs. psychotherapy.  It is erudite, convincing, yet readable.<br /><br />Main differences between Jung & Eastern thought include Jung's view of the 2 directions-[Western extroverted sensing thinking judging (ESTJ) vs. Eastern introverted intuitive feeling perceiving (INFP)]:<br /><br />p. 8: \\"The truth of the East is not in the Eastern way itself, but in the demonstrated need for a balance between intellect and intuition, between thinking and feeling...To be overbalanced in any one aspect of consciousness is a sign of immaturity and \\"barbarism\\", to use Jung's word for it. Consequently, it is not the case that the modem West should give up its highly developed scientific intellect-only that the intuitive and feeling aspects of psychic function must achieve an equally high development in Western consciousness so that a creative balance can be achieved, and a widening of consciousness result. While Jung openly admired the Eastern yoga principle of inclusiveness and balance between the opposing aspects of psychic function, it is clear that he felt that the East had overstressed the intuitive, just as the modem West had over-developed the scientific.\\"<br /><br />p. 14: \\"In Jung's view any unbalance in the split of psychic energy, while it may produce the short-term gains of rigorous specialization (e. g., modern Western technology), will, in the long run, prove detrimental.\\"<br /><br />This is the basis for Jung's several arguments against Westerners directly adopting Eastern methods:<br /><br />p. 18: \\"Here Jung again sounds his warning that the solution for the Westerner cannot be found by taking up the direct practice of Eastern yoga. Says Jung, the neurosis or split within consciousness would then simply be intensified But what can be learned from the East is a general approach to be adopted so that the split, the imbalance between the opposites may be brought into harmony.\\"<br /><br />p. 22: \\"because the Westerner typically does not know his own unconscious, it is quite likely that when he finds the East strange and hard to understand he will project onto it everything he fears and despises in himself...he felt the direct practice of yoga by a Westerner would only serve to strengthen his will and consciousness and so further intensify the split with the unconscious...The outcome would be just as disastrous for the Western neurotic who suffers from the opposite problem of a lack of development of the conscious and a predominance of the unconscious.\\"<br /><br />p. 23: \\"Jung pointed out that if we try to snatch spiritual techniques directly from the East `'we have merely indulged our Western acquisitiveness, confirming yet again that 'everything good is outside.'\\"<br /><br />Specific differences include those between Jungian empirical psychology & Eastern philosophy:<br /><br />p. 61: \\"lack of distinction between philosophy and psychology that seems to typify much Eastern thought.\\"<br /><br />p. 62: \\"the older psychologies of the East and the medieval West are founded on metaphysical concepts which often have little relation to empirical facts.\\"<br /><br />p. 104: \\"Throughout his life Jung admitted his strong attraction to Indian karma and reincarnation theory, but its lack of empirical verification was the obstacle to its full acceptance.\\"<br /><br />p. 188: \\"The error of Eastern thought in this regard is that it is not firmly grounded in the empirical method and instead has allowed itself to become lost in unsupportable metaphysical speculation.\\"<br /><br />p. 189: \\"Jung never thought of his own psychology as a closed theory. To his last years he remained open to new ideas that could come from either East or West.  But throughout his life it was his activity as a psychotherapist that kept Jung skeptical of Eastern metaphysics and rooted in the tradition of Western medical science.\\"<br /><br />Nonetheless, Jung strongly supported studying Eastern thought & adapting it to Western usage:<br /><br />p. 9: \\"The West must not simply attempt to copy the Eastern spiritual yoga, or the East blindly adopt Western science. Each should study the other and gain inspiration from its example, but each must pursue its own development within its own historical consciousness.'\\"<br /><br />p. 23: \\"we must get at Eastern values from within and not from without, seeking them in ourselves, in the unconscious.\\"<br /><br />While this may seem antithetical to Eastern approaches, the Buddha advised individuals to carefully weigh his words themselves and see how applicable they were to them.  Also Vajrayana masters continue to advise caution in accepting a guru/lama and even in considering what the guru tells the to do-in light of their individual discriminating wisdom.<br /><br />Most interesting is the high impact issue of full Samadhi (absorption or Buddhahood) which Jung denied since it involves the dissolution of the ego and, thus, of individual consciousness:<br /><br />p. 142: \\"Can there be mystical experience without an individual ego?\\" Or put another way, ''Is unlimited consciousness of the fullness of reality psychologically possible?\\"<br /><br />p. 161: Jung: \\"They do not realize that a 'universal consciousness' is a contradiction in terms, since exclusion, selection, anti discrimination are the root and essence of everything; that lays claim to the name 'consciousness\\"<br /><br />p. 177: \\"To Jung, consciousness is very narrowly defined as that quality of being related to the ego. `Consciousness needs a center, an ego to which something is conscious.

US	30672120	R2RH7TH74AK6CU	0861713400	298363043	The Essence of Jung's Psychology and Tibetan Buddhism: Western and Eastern Paths to the Heart	Books	4	20	22	N	Y	Good start; makes valid points; opens the door	When originally published in 1986, it was groundbreaking; it's still worth reading, though there are similar books now (Daniel Meckel & Robert Moore's \\"Self Liberation: The Jung-Buddhist Dialogue\\" & others on Western Psychology & Buddhism [See my draft listmania]).  Here the author effectively demonstrates many similarities/parallels between Jung's works & Vajrayana, but not Mahamudra/Dzogchen (MM/Dz).  She provides an introduction to each system-with interesting observations-<br /><br />p. 6: quoting Nancy Wilson Ross, Buddhism: A Way of Life and Thought (NY: Vintage, 1981) p. 44, \\"It has been said that [Hinayana] emphasizes the humanity of the Buddha; Mahayana emphasizes the Buddha nature of humanity.\\"<br /><br />p. 17: \\"According to one author [S. B. Dasgupta, An Introduction to Tantric Buddhism, University of Calcutta, 1974, p. 54] there was no one particular person who introduced tantra into Buddhism at any particular time, but rather that it has been gradually incorporated in the course of centuries.  The same author maintains that there are no fundamental differences between Hindu and Buddhist tantras [p. 145].\\"  Others disagree, stating \\"it was crystallized into a definitive form by the 3rd century\\" CE & that there are fundamental differences especially in the definition of yab-yum.<br /><br />p. 21: \\"On the path toward freedom any passion and desire must be utilized and transformed into wisdom.  This is a very basic principle of any Tantric practice.  In this respect it is similar to homeopathy, working on the principle that like cures like.  The very same element that causes a disease may if applied in a proper dose act as an antidote and a cure.\\"<br /><br />She then compares the methodologies, archetypal symbols, similarities/differences including--Tara, Vajrayogini vs. Jung's Anima, Book of the Dead, bliss vs. suffering, attachment, cultural differences, dangers, Buddhahood vs. individuation, compassion, & synchronicity.  For example, she claims that Tibetans coming west was not coincidence but a synchronistic event.  I agree with the vast majority of her assertions.  However, since p. 102: \\"Jung claims he does not make philosophical or metaphysical statements and that his work is based on empirical evidence only,\\" it seems likely that Jung's limitations of individuation vs. Buddhahood were due to his lack of empirical observation of a Buddha.  So, this distinction may be illusory.  Further, despite his Thinker orientation, Jung's lack of compassion may be overstated considering his guidance to therapists regarding empathy during individual dyadic relationships with clients vs. the application of theory.  Also, many (e.g. Bhikshuni Lekshe Tsomo) have commented upon the effects on Buddhism in new countries-now starting to manifest in the West.  Some psychological differences were shown in Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron's \\"Blossoms of the Dharma\\"- p. 144: \\"Feelings of low self-esteem and inadequacy are prevalent in Westerners...Tibetans do not have words in their language for low self-esteem or guilt, so Westerners' problems with these feelings are not readily comprehensible to them.  His Holiness had difficulty understanding how someone could not like himself.  He looked around this room of educated, successful people and asked, `Who feels low self-esteem?'  Everyone looked at each other and replied, `We all do.'  His Holiness was shocked.\\"  Also, Bhikshuni Wendy Finster (a clinical psychologist from Australia) p. 158 \\"Only enlightened persons are totally mentally healthy.\\"  She speaks to sangha dangers, responsibilities, & cultural differences and says: p. 166: [not meeting one's expectations] \\"causes us to judge ourselves harshly and feel guilty, and as a result our self-esteem plummets.  This surprises our Asian teachers; they do not realize the level of self-criticism and self-hatred that can arise in individuals raised in our culture.\\"  This view does not conflict with Jung's warning about going native with Easternreligions.  Nevertheless, Moacanin argues convincingly for adoption from the East: pp. 104-5: \\"Eastern symbols are fresh to the Western mind and therefore possess a greater capacity to inspire and stimulate the imagination, while unfortunately for many in the West our symbols have become ossified and thus have lost their intrinsic meaning.\\"  Since she states p. 47: \\"Concepts are instruments of protection from experience\\" which reflects deep similarities in the 2 systems (& MM/Dz), it remains to be seen how the 2 will interact in the future.  Still, archetypal symbols are universal.  Thus, the 4-sided deity mandalas of Vajrayana and their Mt. Meru surrounded by 4 continents do not significantly differ from John Weir Perry's \\"Lord of the 4 Quarters.\\"evertheless, Moacanin argues convincingly for adoption from the East: pp. 104-5: \\"Eastern symbols are fresh to the Western mind and therefore possess a greater capacity to inspire and stimulate the imagination, while unfortunately for many in the West our symbols have become ossified and thus have lost their intrinsic meaning.\\"  Since she states p. 47: \\"Concepts are instruments of protection from experience\\" which reflects deep similarities in the 2 systems (& MM/Dz), it remains to be seen how the 2 will interact in the future.

Namgyal's other famed text, \\"Moonbeams of Mahamudra\\" is available in English: \\"MM: The Quintessence of Mind & Meditation.\\"  The 9th Karmapa's 3rd text is also available: \\"Mahamudra: Eliminating the Darkness of Ignorance.\\"  Along with the 3rd Karmapa's MM Prayer (see Tai Situ's book on this), these are the best MM primary texts available in English translation/commentary.  Jamg&ouml;n Kongtr&uuml;l (p. 164). said POD & CNS were the most practical & easiest to apply.  Thrangu's commentaries tend to be rather loose & not stanza-by-stanza.  He attempts to reveal the work's essence & elaborate on difficult points.  In this book, he gives the best exposition I've read on the relation between Mind-Only and Madhyamaka/MM views-- p. 72: \\"The Mind-Only School as well as Vajrayana, teaches that all external perceptions are mind.\\"  He also provides information on p. 142: \\"The 2nd type is the `skipping-the-grades type\\" (in addition to the instantaneous & gradual types of students) & p. 158: innate vs. imputed emotions.  He elucidates Namgyal's expositions on mingling meditation & post-meditation [I'd call it meta-meditation], the 4 MM yogas compared with the 10 bhumis & 5 paths.  While the mapping seems a bit contrived to me, these are, after all, simply models.  Models are a type of analogy & no analogy is perfect.  I do wish translators would avoid negative terms-i.e. \\"impermanent\\" rather than \\"transient\\" which I find more meaningful.  He also makes some controversial, pithy statements which succinctly summarize the text: p. 70: \\"We have wavelike thoughts.\\" [like an EEG]<br /><br />p. 73: \\"Actually the mind and the mental image are of one identity, and cannot be separated.\\"<br /><br />p. 78: \\"The word `emptiness' is used expediently to dispel the tendency to cling to a concrete nature in phenomena.\\"<br /><br />pp. 79-80: `We train in innate mind essence as Dharmakaya and innate perception as the light of Dharmakaya...One also trains in seeing that innate thoughts are the expression of Dharmakaya.\\"<br /><br />p. 100: \\"Everything is meditation training when you have naturally aware presence of mind, and nothing is meditation when you are distracted.\\"<br /><br />In summary, it's a fine book-especially if you haven't yet read the original in translation.  If you have, it's still a nice refresher-and repetition can be valuable.

The authors are from numerous countries, mostly European.  Major sections include: history & monastic discipline, living as a Buddhist nun, nun's teachings, and a poignant appendix: p. 187: Bhikshuni Tenzin Palmo (England) \\"The Situation of Western Monastics,\\" which made the Dalai Lama weep and an interview with the him in which he stated, pp. 192-3: \\"I think the rights of women practitioners in the Tibetan Buddhist community have been neglected.\\"<br /><br />There are many references to cultural differences between East and West and the need to adapt:<br /><br />p. ix: Dalai Lama: \\"Wherever Buddhism has taken root in a new land, there has always been a certain variation in the style in which it is observed.<br /><br />p. xxxiv: editor Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron (USA): \\"Western monastics must determine how to keep some of the precepts according to the society and situation in which they find themselves.  When Buddhism spread from India to Tibet, China, and other countries, the way of keeping the precepts was also adjusted to fit the mentality of the society as well as the geography, climate, economics, and so on of the country.  This process is only beginning in the West now.\\"<br /><br />pp. 7-8: Bhikshuni Lekshe Tsomo (Hawaii), \\"Buddhist Monasticism & its Western Adaptation\\"--\\"Differences in social conditions now and at the time of the Buddha require thoughtful adaptation of the precepts in the present day.\\"<br /><br />p. 19-21: Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh (Thailand) \\"The History of the Bhikkhuni Sangha\\"--\\"The Buddha always made exceptions after the general rule was established...Questioning the authority of certain passages in the Buddhist scriptures is a delicate issue, and we have to be very careful.  How can we prove that everything was passed down exactly as the Buddha spoke it?  On the other hand, isn't there a danger in saying that certain passages are later interpolations?  I become suspicious only when a passage does not correspond with the spirit of the main core of the Buddha's teachings.\\"<br /><br />p. 31: Kabilsingh: \\"Certain ancient Indian social values were taken into Buddhism, because the Buddhist community was not separate from the general Indian society at the time.\\"<br /><br />p. 117: Chi-Kwang Sunim (Australia), \\"A Strong Tradition Adapting to Change: The Nuns in Korea\\"--\\"\\"Westernization and technology are not the problem; what we do with them is.\\"<br /><br />pp. 141-2: Thubten Chodron \\"Finding Your Way\\"--\\"What is the essence of the Buddha's teachings that we must practice, bring back to our Western countries, and teach others?  What is cultural form that we need not bring to the West? ...I had to confront the fact that copying a cultural form and others' external behavior was not necessarily practicing the Dharma...Because most of us Western monastics are operating cross-culturally, we would benefit from adapting the positive aspects and values of all culture we contact, while leaving behind whatever prejudice and preconceptions we may encounter.\\"<br /><br />pp. 167-8: Bhikshuni Wendy Finster (Australia) \\"We should be careful to distinguish between the Buddhadharma & the cultural context within which it has developed & be sure that we grasp the essence of the Dharma without getting caught up in the paraphernalia appropriate to its Asian cultural context.  We must make an effort through our own individual practice to separate the grain from the chaff.\\"<br /><br />Of particular note: Bhikshuni Ngawang Chodron's (England) cogent arguments for full (Bhikshuni) ordination for nuns: p. 91:  Under King Langdarma most Tibetan \\"monks were killed or forcefully disrobed, but 3 who survived fled to Kham, Eastern Tibet.  There they met 2 Chinese monks who completed the required quorum of five monks to give ordination.  If Tibetan monks could enlist the aid of Chinese monks, I feel that nuns in the Tibetan tradition should be able to enlist the help of Chinese monks & nuns who now give the Bhikshuni ordination...A central land is defined in the scriptures as a place which has the 4 classes of Buddhist disciples: bhikshus, bhikshunis, & lay practitioners of both sexes.  If a place has no bhikshunis, it is not a central land...Why should a 70 year old nun still be a novice?\\"<br /><br />Further, there were some very interesting psychological observations and comments:<br /><br />p. 144: Thubten Chodron: \\"Feelings of low self-esteem and inadequacy are prevalent in Westerners...Tibetans do not have words in their language for low self-esteem or guilt, so Westerners' problems with these feelings are not readily comprehensible to them.

US	30672120	RS1D8H9RDYZR0	1559391693	583961671	The Third Karmapa's Mahamudra Prayer	Books	5	11	12	N	Y	Small book, big impact	This work includes a brief introduction, a stanza-by-stanza commentary on the 3rd Karmapa's (1284-1339) short root text, a short Q&A section, & 2 appendices: teachings in Berlin 1986 on \\"eternalism & nihilism\\" & the 5 Buddha families.  The author acknowledges sources including-16th Karmapa, Thrangu Rinpoche, Salje Rinpoche, & Kalu Rinpoche's texts.  The book is written in a very easy-to-read style in which the author very simply explains erudite, complex principles & issues directly-related to the valuable root text.  Unusually, the commentary is as good as the root text!  Some of the author's assertions are controversial, but he succinctly and convincingly gets his points across.  By design, it is not a comprehensive text (e.g. Namgyal's \\"Mahamudra: Quintessence of Mind and Meditation\\"), but provides tremendous insight into some of the more difficult Mahamudra (MM) views/concepts with modern/pithy examples (i. e. the blind men and the elephant).  Some main topics: p. 40: types of lamas (lineage, root, of blessing, in general), pp. 70-1: Madhyamaka & Chittamara vs. MM, p. 105: ego & MM, p. 109: feminism, & Appendix 2: the 5 kleshas vs. 5 wisdoms.  Overall he provides a practical, balanced, down to earth, & insightful viewpoint.  I've recorded almost 2 pages of quotes for my collection.  Notably:<br /><br />He has an integrative approach to psychology with many parallels to Jung.<br /><br />p. 82: \\"We have to accept the quality of our effort and also our shortcomings, and then to work on this basis.  This is another example of what I meant by saying that we first need a structured ego.\\"<br /><br />p. 103: \\"U. F. E. = Unidentified Flying Ego\\"<br /><br />p. 106: \\"To first see our own ego very clearly, to recognize and accept it, is a very good foundation.  In this way Dharma practice can really dissolve into a person.\\"<br /><br />p. 119: \\"As long as we call ourselves `I,\\" we are under the total control of karma.\\"<br /><br />p. 139: \\"We need to develop a state of mind that will not succumb to confusion when facing something that goes beyond our conventional way of thinking.\\"<br /><br />p. 140: \\"We understand in accordance with who we are and with our individual makeup.\\"<br /><br />An understanding approach to the relationship between Buddhism, human society, & change:<br /><br />p. 31: \\"Nowadays people are able to understand greater and deeper things far more easily then a 100, 200, or 300 years ago.\\"<br /><br />p. 46: \\"The Buddha managed to attain enlightenment without the present form of Buddhism; therefore every sentient being in the 10 directions and the 3 times will manage to do the same.\\"<br /><br />p. 101: \\"The outer appearance-the robes, the rituals, and so forth-will transform slowly.  Slow transformation is allowed.  The Buddha himself said that the essence has to remain pure, whereas the way in which it is presented can gradually and naturally transform.  But they cannot be changed intentionally.\\"<br /><br />p. 144: \\"Buddhism is a new term that came into use in the West about 300 years ago.\\"<br /><br />Most of the book is about mind.  Tai Situ cogently relates mind to the interdependence of sentient beings & phenomena-stressing the union of subject & object in relation to the absolute nature or essence of mind or MM (bringing to mind Kabbalah & holograms).  Many of his observations are quite profound:<br /><br />p. 69-74: \\"Our mind does not exist as something solid; it does not have any dualistic reality...The essence of mind is limitless...Truly seeing the non-dualistic nature of mind, which is union, which has no solid reality & yet is the essence of everything, we follow the Middle Way...Mind is inconceivable; it is beyond thoughts & concepts; thoughts result from not having realized the nature of mind, & for this reason the description will never be accurate as long as thoughts are used to discover or describe the nature of mind...Mind is not a composite...the mind is ultimate truth...the nature of mind, which is the final ultimate truth.\\"<br /><br />p. 83: \\"We see our mind and its connection with everything else.  This is what Mahamudra teachings describe as \\"clear light\\" or as `luminosity'.  It is the characteristic of the mind, the way the mind exists.  This means that everything we perceive as an object out there, and everything we hold to be the perceiving subject, is interdependent.\\"  [p. 75: union of emptiness & interdependence (non-duality)]<br /><br />p. 134: \\"'One-pointedness' is reached when one is able to see the absolute truth within everything, including oneself.\\"<br /><br />p. 135: It [Mahamudra] involves the continuous presence of a sense of mindfulness, awareness, and connection with our basic nature, which is neither solid nor blank.  This basic nature is within everything.  It has the sense of voidness, and at the same time clarity.  It has ultimate intelligence beyond eternalism and nihilism.  It cannot be restricted to any extreme.\\"<br /><br />p. 144: \\"Because of non-existence everything exists.  Without vastness or space nothing could exist.\\"<br /><br />Some of his more interesting, if controversial statements include:<br /><br />p. 50-1: \\"The blessing of the Buddha, or any kind of blessing, is just a facilitation...Every blessing that we request constitutes a facilitation, a favorable condition for our prayers to come true.\\"<br /><br />p. 87: \\"Every sentient being suffers unnecessarily-suffering is not the nature of sentient beings, it is not in accord with their potential.\\"<br /><br />p. 89: \\"When the union of compassion and emptiness is reached, everything is of equal importance.\\"<br /><br />p. 102: \\"There is nothing wrong with B&ouml;n, it is almost identical to Buddhism.\\"<br /><br />p. 139: \\"Within the Vajrayana everything that needs to be explained and understood is relative.\\"<br /><br />My favorite quotes from the root text of the 3rd Karmapa are:<br /><br />p. 70: \\"Under the domination of ignorance, self-awareness is mistaken for a self.\\"<br /><br />p. 72: \\"[Mind] is unity, the path of the middle.\\"<br /><br />p. 73: \\"The true state is beyond intellect, it is uncreated.\\"e our mind and its connection with everything else.

As usual the DL takes a non-sectarian stand--p. 191: \\"Thus, each Tibetan tradition presents a spiritual path that combines into the practice for one individual the essence of the three vehicles of Hinayana, Mahayana, and tantrayana.  Thus, no matter who we are, we uphold the three-fold teachings of the complete path of Hinayana, Mahayana, and tantrayana\\" & extends his (p. 260) non-sectarianism beyond Buddhism.  He describes the relationships between Gelug MM, Kagyu MM (p. 223)-e.g. Gelug MM is only gradual vs. Kagyu MM & p. 240 Dzogchen (Dz) which also include the instantaneous-& even (p. 227) B&ouml;n Dz, but, p. 129: does seem to imply that Gelug MM is superior to Dz.  He also includes crisp/helpful descriptions of numerous Buddhist/Vajrayana concepts including: pp. 59-61: mind defined per MM [space-time], p. 67: mindfulness, alertness (\\"being the flashlight\\"), attentiveness & focus, pp. 192-4: 4 levels of mandala offering, pp. 200-2: common & individual karma, p. 205: common preliminaries to MM, pp. 210-4: practical advice on commitments, the guru, empowerments, etc., p. 212: fine points of guru yoga, p. 215: yidam/deity yoga-addressing gender (i.e. Avalokiteshwara/Tara for all practitioners), p. 270: the Pacifier Tradition of Padampa Sanggye, p. 309: the 3 \\"we's\\", & p. 348: Lojong mind training.<br /><br />He also makes enlightening/provocative statements: pp. 109-110: \\"We take refuge, or safe direction in life, in order to distinguish our practice from non-Buddhist paths,\\" p. 207: \\"If we take the meaning and usage of technical terms that we have learned from the context of one text and try to apply them to another text-even, sometimes, to another book by the same author-we many see many contradictions and become very confused.  Thus, it is important to understand the use of terminology within the context of each specific text we study,\\"\\" & points out that p. 266 \\"Hoshang\\" means monk in Tibetan such that the famous debate with the Chinese monk \\"Hoshang\\" is not a disparagement of Chinese Chan or Japanese Zen.  He delves into Western psychology in describing \\"me\\" vs. ego (pp. 74-7) & says p. 75: \\"An inflated ego, then is the closest Western equivalent for what we call in Buddhism `apprehending me' as existing solidly...false me.  A healthy ego is analogous to the conventional `me' discussed in Buddhism.  The `me' that is the object of focus of an inflated ego is analogous to the Buddhist false `me.'  He also provides a rarely described parallel with Sakya MM pp. 171-2: \\"Sakya transmits the meditational method of the view of clarity and voidness not apprehended apart.  Also known as the causal everlasting stream of the alaya, the all-encompassing foundation, and the inseparability of samsara and nirvana,\\" pp. 234-9: other voidness, & maha-madhyamaka.  He provides cogent arguments for a middle way approach to scoping arguments: p. 307: \\"If we do not recognize the true and inherent identity at which we are aiming our refutation, then no matter how many logical reasons we cite, we cannot apply them accurately to hit the mark\\" and p. 308: \\"If...what we recognize as the object to be refuted is under-pervasive-in other words, too limited in scope-we consequently refute too little.\\"<br /><br />However, this work has a number of paradoxes from a Western scientific perspective.  Regarding mind, p. 65: \\"Buddhism does not posit a universal or collective mind,\\" but, p. 78: There is a surface and a deeper level about everything, including mind, and both actually exist.  But neither exists on its own,\\" & p. 251: \\"When yogis have realization of the straightforward non-conceptual experience of primordial mind, they see that all phenomena, in a cognitive sense, are emanations of that primordial mind.\\"  Furthermore, he speculates that p. 253: clear light mind = Holy Ghost = Buddha nature!  The problem here may be the translation or differences in Eastern/Western psychologies/perspectives.  My problem with this book, is the portion of the prasangika-madhyamaka (PM) philosophy such that naming causes existence--p. 128: \\"The existence of all phenomena is established by virtue simply of imputation or names,\\" p. 129: \\"The existence of all phenomena is established by virtue simply of names or mental labeling, p. 150: \\"The PM school, however, uses dependent arising to mean that the existence of all phenomena-of samsara or nirvana, non-static or static-arises or is established dependently by virtue simply of mental labeling,\\" p. 316: \\"All phenomena lack any existence other than one established simply in relation to names,\\" p. 336: \\"the object being labeled dependently exists by virtue simply of names and mental labeling...On the basis of existence and identity by virtue simply of labeling with names...\\" etc.  It's too repetitive to be a translation problem.  It seems to imply that the platypus, dinosaurs, distant stars...didn't exist until named.  Such naming in the West infers primitive magic or fantasy fiction (e.g. Ursula LeGuin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy\\").  More specifically, he belabors the non-existence of an inherent self.  Admittedly, the self is an aggregate of numerous influences & thus, is not inherent/eternal/unchanging as some Westerners may assume-though Jung defined the ego as a complex-an amalgam/aggregate-not an eternalist view & not endemic in the West.  Nevertheless, the map is not the territory and the name is not the thing itself.  The author ignores set theory, statistics, & pattern recognition.  There must be a defined pattern that represents an individual since one can recognize someone after an absence of 25 years & a computer programs can recognize faces, individuals by how they type, etc.  It seems to me that labeling/naming is dependent upon the basis for naming (gestalt) not the other way around.  The failed Vajrayana search for a solid mind/self (Vipashyana) proves nothing-one cannot see his/her face directly, only in reflection-but a pattern is statistically real.  Indeed, IMHO, form is pattern & pattern is form.  Since pattern is by nature an aggregate, it is (in Tibetan terms) empty.

These include the unusual Elizabeth Harris' \\"Buddhism and the Media,\\" Esther Bianchi's \\"Tiexiangsi: A Gelugpa Nunnery in Contemporary China,\\" Masters & Tsomo's essay on Mary Foster in Hawaii, Thich Minh Duc's wonderful biography of Vietnamese Bhikkuni [fully ordained nun] Dom Luu, Tenzin Palmo's pithy and succinct description of Tonglen practice, and Bhikkuni Kusuma's brilliant essay \\"Inaccuracies in Buddhist Women's History\\" among others.<br /><br />A major insight concerns Buddhist differences between East & West:<br /><br />p. 327: Tsomo: \\"Western Buddhists tend to value lay practice, while Asian Buddhists value ordination.  Due to their cultural backgrounds, practitioners East and West often understand Buddhism in very different ways.\\"<br /><br />pp. 298-9: Mushin Ikeda-Nash: \\"In forging an American Buddhism, we bring our national characteristics of energy and idealism, or core values of equity and democracy, to Buddhist teachings and practices that have come to us from ancient Asian cultures...The fact that the word `sangha' is now commonly used in the West to indicate any community of Buddhist practitioners, monastic or lay, reflects an increased validation of lay practice.  In its original meaning, the term `sangha' referred to the community of ordained Buddhist monks and nuns.\\"<br /><br />p. 231: Tashi Zangmo: \\"Among Asian women the social norm is to believe everything a teacher might say.  Penetrating questions are avoided.\\"<br /><br />p. 115: Thich Minh Duc quoting Dom Luu: \\"We must present the teachings in accordance with social conditions and the tastes of the population in that time.\\"<br /><br />This is a fine book well worth your time if you have any interest in the subject matter.	2005-04-28

The author (Karma Sungrab Nged&ouml;n Tenpay Gyaltsen) is very familiar with English and Western life, providing a book of labels, models, & analogies.  Despite the title's reference to an instantaneous approach (found in both MM & Dz), the author takes a gradualist approach which is rather traditional, theoretical, light duty, descriptive, informational, mythical, & cursory.  He is not very prescriptive or action-oriented.  While the subject matter is of the most profound in Tibetan Buddhism, its essence is not emphasized here.  The presentation on MM is more of a surface view or survey.  The description of Dz has virtually no depth, spiritual knowledge (Prajna) or wisdom (Jnana).  The author speaks ABOUT the subject but not TO the subject.  For example, Trekch&ouml; and T&ouml;gal (the primary Dz practices) are hardly mentioned.  As with other Vajrayana books, the Western cultural biases are addressed but not the author's.  Thus, the Dzogchen Ponlop states: p. xv-xvi.: \\"Buddhism is presented as a science of mind in contrast to a religion, and as a body of wisdom that is fundamentally free of any cultural forms and that is accessible to all,\\" but on p. 156: \\"Our standards are just concepts; they are cultural.\\"  It must be remembered that, p. 190: \\"Buddha encourages us to be inquiring and skeptical about our spiritual path.\\"<br /><br />However, despite the author's preconceptions/assumptions, he provides at least two fine, worthwhile items.  The first is a nice exposition on p. 99: of \\"the 9 stages of resting the mind\\" - both a figure and commentary (I purchased a woodblock print of it in Lhasa).  In his book \\"Luminous Mind,\\" Kalu Rinpoche calls it \\"The Path of Shamatha.\\"  Secondly, the author provides a very fine description of luminosity: pp. 116-119: \\"Appearances are the gleam or glow of the mind...Recognize the nature of appearances as the gleam or glow of the mind...There is a constant creative energy to the mind, which is the basis for the arising of the mind's radiant appearances.\\"  Still, there isn't really much to this book.  The MM section could be used as a reference, but Chetsang Rinpoche's \\"The Practice of Mahamudra\\" is far better, not to mention Thrangu Rinpoche's many works which provide analysis & depth; plus there's Traleg Kyabgon's wonderful \\"Mind at East.\\"  As for Dzogchen, read Namkhai Norbu, Tulku Urgyen, or Drubwang Tsoknyi Rinpoche's \\"Carefree Dignity.\\"  For a more integrated approach, read Chokyi Nyima's \\"Union of MM & Dz\\" or Karma Chagme's incredible \\"Naked Awareness\\" & \\"A Spacious Path to Freedom.\\"ize the nature of appearances as the gleam or glow of the mind...There is a constant creative energy to the mind, which is the basis for the arising of the mind's radiant appearances.\\"  Still, there isn't really much to this book.

However, as David Gellner points out, p. 156, \\"Social work by monks or nuns, worthy though it is, is a modernist adaptation of traditional Buddhist practice.\\"  Indeed, the book seems an application of feminism to Buddhism, disregarding Buddhist spirituality.  In fact, some of the interviewed nuns disagreed with Western women authors on the why of gender differences, their meaning to them, & their actual importance.  IMHO, the strong Western feminist bias detracts from the book's impact.  Per Caren Ohlson p. 248: \\"The conflict between Asian and Western cultural values is just one example of the challenges...Western focus on individual goals and the cultivation of a `unique' identity grate against the Asian idea of identity in connection to family and community, not to a sense of individual uniqueness.\\"  Strangely, her article is replete with bias & high valence language-seemingly she knows better than Asian nuns what's best for them.  \\"Misogyny\\" is overused-in truth, nuns model it--its main meaning is \\"anti-marriage;\\" though \\"institutional androcentrism\\" & \\"anti-feminist\\" are justified, IMO.  Several writers convincingly (both historically & per present trends) object to the 8 special rules making nuns subservient to monks.  But their discounting Sri Lanka monks' objections to breaking lineage & labeling them misogynists is unjustified--people vary in need for structure etc. & attributing motivations to other people (& in a different culture) is risky at best.  Also, most of their arguments are sociological-- p. 239: Caren Ohlson: \\"the socially constructed dichotomy of `woman' as the temptress and `man' as tempted.\\"  Jungians might consider this as psychological projection.  Tsomo states: p. 67: \\"If Buddhist monastic institutions are to continue in the modern world, they must be based on gender equity...Neither the Buddha, his followers, nor the Buddhist monastic codes can be extracted from their social context...Now that gender equity has become part of a new global ethic, it is opportune to explore how Buddhism's egalitarian principles can be practically applied to social and religious institutions.\\"  But this assumes that SE Asia chooses to enter the \\"modern\\" (Western) world-one in which Buddhism has yet to make a major impact--despite p. 231 note 8: Elise Anne DeVido saying: \\"The requirements of the modern world demand modification to , or liberal interpretation of, the Vinaya.\\"  True, in her Introduction, Tsomo argues cogently concerning the legitimacy of Vinaya monastic rules & their relation to the 8.  She is supported strongly in the last essay: pp. 237-8: Caren Ohlson: \\"Sponberg claims that the above story is by no means a historical account to the establishment of the nun's order.  On the contrary, he asserts that the story was fabricated by monks...after the death of the Buddha...The 8 special rules that were created to govern nuns' behavior represented a mirror image of the husband/wife relationship in the lay community.\\"  Still, it's the prevailing Buddhist myth and scattered social action is unlikely to change it quickly especially without strong, active involvement & leadership by local Buddhist men & women.  Tsomo & others' books do document progress in this & related areas.stic institutions are to continue in the modern world, they must be based on gender equity...Neither the Buddha, his followers, nor the Buddhist monastic codes can be extracted from their social context...Now that gender equity has become part of a new global ethic, it is opportune to explore how Buddhism's egalitarian principles can be practically applied to social and religious institutions.\\"  But this assumes that SE Asia chooses to enter the \\"modern\\" (Western) world-one in which Buddhism has yet to make a major impact--despite p. 231 note 8: Elise Anne DeVido saying: \\"The requirements of the modern world demand modification to , or liberal interpretation of, the Vinaya.\\"  True, in her Introduction, Tsomo argues cogently concerning the legitimacy of Vinaya monastic rules & their relation to the 8.

E.), extensive endnotes, a map, and an index.  Much of the material is common and consistent throughout the biographies.  Nuns frequently become abbots, eat only vegetables, memorize texts easily, recite texts rapidly, perform austerities, chant, build monasteries, and meditate, but don't keep donations and usually don't wear silk (worms are killed in the processing).  Mostly they are of high integrity, but a very few are involved in court intrigue.  Tsai states that there is an (p. 126 note 104) \\"editor's bias in favor of the famous and influential.\\"  As in other collections of biographies covering centuries, the older ones include miraculous stories and events (hagiography) while the later ones are more biographical.  The chapters are arranged chronologically here.  High esteem was given to these nuns by royalty-- p. 1: \\"Although many of the Buddhist texts, both Disciples Vehicle and Mahayana, or Great Vehicle, contain virulent misogynistic sections, there were in fact no doctrinal reasons that denied enlightenment and, later, Buddhahood to women.\\"  It is interesting to see an old Chinese view since many recent books address present conditions in SE Asia, Sri Lanka, and Tibet (e.g. Tsomo & Findly).  Such books often cite the Buddha's cousin & attendant Ananda as a feminist hero.  Tsai states: p. 134 note 92: \\"Because Ananda is often contrasted unfavorably with another of the Buddha's disciples, one must suspect sectarian rivalries among followers of the Buddha.\\"  Religious works are generally compiled long after the avatar has died, allowing the followers to insert their own biases or desires.  Most interestingly p. 140 note 41: \\"The indigenous tradition underlies much of this Buddhist material.\\"  These include the intimate relationship (at the time) between Taoism and Buddhism, self-immolation (e.g. 3 nuns did it together) as a religious act, and the nature of meditation-similar to Taoism and other ancient texts wherein the meditator appears dead or unfeeling.  The latter culminated (according to Tibetan books) in a debate between Indian and Chinese Buddhists (with the Indian winning, based on meditation method).  Unfortunately, this book does not address doctrinal, philosophical, or methodological aspects of Buddhism except at a surface level (e.g. vegetarianism).  But even this shows cultural differences-since Tibetan Buddhists eat meat and the Buddha permitted it under most circumstances even to monastics.d the nature of meditation-similar to Taoism and other ancient texts wherein the meditator appears dead or unfeeling.

It consists of essays by individual American women Buddhists as well as some discussions amongst them, including some basic Buddhist principles and personal insights: p. 57: Tsering Everest: \\"As we mature in our practice, we gradually stop attempting to separate mediation and real life.  Eventually, we find that there is no difference between the two\\" and p. 59: Eko Susan Noble [Shingon priest]: \\"In a spirit of openness and inclusiveness, we can dispel all the ordinary value judgments that constantly propel the wheel of samsara.  We become empowered by our diversity.\\"  But it also addresses sensitive feminist points: p. 53: Jacqueline Mandell: \\"If the word for `woman' means `lesser birth' and this word has been used for thousands of years, it has an effect on people.  We need to dispel the myth that being a woman is a lower birth, not only on a societal level, but also on levels we have unconsciously internalized\\" and p. 129: Eko Susan Noble [Shingon priest]: \\"It is an open secret that it was actually women who first brought Buddhism to Japan.\\"  But, IMHO, the best part is the discussion amongst the contributors in \\"Chapter 12. The Monastic Experience,\\" especially the comments of concerning changes in Buddhism: p. 129: Eko Susan Noble [Shingon priest]: \\"The Buddha made a statement that some of the minor precepts could be changed and certainly in Japan there have been some very radical changes...Tendai Master Saicho...felt that adherence to the full 250 precepts codified in India was inappropriate for the Japanese people\\" and p. 137: Bhikshuni Nora Kunli Shih: \\"Here in the West, the Buddhist traditions that are transmitted to us are more or less spliced together with Eastern culture...In my experience, the Asian acceptance of hierarchy is quite different from what many Western women are prepared to handle.  I sometimes seriously question seriously whether this is really what the Buddha's teachings are all about...For me to prove that I am as capable as a man serves no purpose, for a man is not something that I want to be...Many useful Western ideas are not accepted simply because they are not a part of tradition and don't fit the structure...Thus it is important to consider what is of intrinsic value in the Buddha's teachings and how the teachings address the problems of today, here and now.\\"  This chapter alone is worth the read, raising its contribution to the future of Buddhism..For me to prove that I am as capable as a man serves no purpose, for a man is not something that I want to be...Many useful Western ideas are not accepted simply because they are not a part of tradition and don't fit the structure...Thus it is important to consider what is of intrinsic value in the Buddha's teachings and how the teachings address the problems of today, here and now.\\"  This chapter alone is worth the read, raising its contribution to the future of Buddhism.	2005-03-30

It is based on papers from \\"Women Changing Contemporary Buddhism\\" Conference.  Some are scholarly, some biographical (noted with symbol in the Table of Contents).  Many of the latter were interviews by Martine Batchelor (author of \\"Walking on Lotus Flowers\\").  It includes pieces on many countries both Eastern and Western, providing an eye-opening breadth of view.  It includes considerable material on ordination and the relationships among different categories of nuns, monks, and lay practitioners.  Some of the contributors are well known in the West (e.g. Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron, Martine Batchelor, and Jan Willis).  The topics also have large scope: teachers/teachings, political & social change, the arts, and health.  Some of the articles were outstanding, though each reader will have differing favorites.  I particularly liked Amy Schmidt's piece on Dipa Ma, Melissa Kerin's on Tibetan nuns now creating sand mandalas and thangkas and visiting the West, Kate Wheeler's sensitive piece on motherhood, and the last piece about famed Tibetan female doctor Kandro Yangkar.  But my favorite of all was Hi-ah Park's fascinating piece on how she became a Buddhist Shaman.  There's a wealth of material here-something for everyone interested in Buddhist women.  I think it makes much headway towards (p. 5): The hypothesis of this book: \\"that, in the contemporary setting, women are playing a significant and even decisive role in the way forms, practices, and institutions of Buddhism are changing to meet the needs and demands of life in late 20th and early 21st century culture.\\"  Supporting the editor's contention that we (p. 6): \\"need new and more efficacious forms of Buddhist practices in the contemporary setting,\\" contributors have made some profound and potentially far-reaching conclusions concerning adaptation of Buddhism to the West:<br /><br />p. 98: Rotraut Wurst: \\"Many Western women don't normally retain many Asian elements in their Buddhist practice.\\"<br /><br />p. 330: Melissa Kerin quoting Alan Spoonberg: \\"Buddhist attitudes towards women were shaped, in part at least, in reference to the social circumstances of the day.\\"<br /><br />p. 339: Judy Dworkin quoting the Dalai Lama in \\"Freedom in Exile\\": \\"It is not sufficient for religious people to be involved with prayer.

James is a fine writer of stories that happen to be about murder.  Her characters are very interesting--and there are always, of course, many with means, motive, and opportunity--or it wouldn't have any mystery.  This particular tale starts our slowly but (after about 100 pages) shifts into high gear and is thereafter difficult to put down.  There are some interesting nuances for the Dalgleish series concerning staff promotions as well as Dalgleish's romance with Emma (from the prior book \\"Death in Holy Orders\\").  I like the continuity, but would prefer more depth to the relationships.  The extensive detail given in the first part of the book does not include much on these relationships amongst the police staff.  The Table of Contents is actually interesting here because it lists a chapter for each of 3 victims.  So you know before reading word one of the book that there are 3 victimes--BUT, it turns out the most suspenseful part of the book concerns a red herring of who the victim is.  Don't worry, I wouldn't dream of saying anything else on this.  The author throws in some sudden new characters/events out of the blue, includes some difficult to believe events (car smashes bicycle but no one is hurt & etc.), and unlike Agatha Christie (my favorite, I admit), doesn't provide (at least I couldn't see it) all the clues necessary to solve the case.  Maybe I missed something?  There didn't seem an explanation of how Dalgleish figured out whodoneit.  I don't have any problem if it's subtle or I just can't figure it out, but the answer should be evident at the end.  Frankly, the suspense regarding Dalgleish's romance (with a dearth of detail) is greater, IMHO, than the murders.  Still, it's a fun read and better than most contemporary mysteries--which also fail in providing the necessary and sufficient.	2005-03-26

All the women are associated with Zen, Theravada, or Tibetan Buddhist organizations in the U.S.; almost all residents thereof at some time.  Thus, it presents a number of obvious dichotomies: feminism vs. authoritarian, patriarchal Buddhism; East vs. West; social activism vs. inner spirituality; & monasticism vs. lay Buddhism.  It includes photos of many of the women interviewed.  It is written in a flowing, descriptive travelogue style-almost like a novel.  I particularly liked the chapters on nuns & other female leaders within the Buddhist hierarchy.  The author attempted to balance the many divergent opinions by presenting interviews with differing points of view.  However, the major thrust of the book is more feminist than Buddhist.  There is virtually nothing on how Buddhist practices are adapting to the West.  Rather, the focus is on form/structure/leadership of Buddhist organizations in America.  This might be an important feminist work but not an important Buddhist work.  It virtually ignores practitioners not intimately associated with a particular monastery or study center (e.g. the Mahasiddi tradition of Kagyu Mahamudra or Dzogchen or solitary retreats like Tenzin Palmo's in \\"Reflections on a Mountain Lake\\").  So, it seems to be rather group oriented.  It does contain a gutsy yet sensitive treatment of the sexual & alcoholic exploits of monks & male Buddhist leaders in the U.S. and also has a couple of good quotes: p. 143: Roshi Jiyu Kennett: \\"In the Bible it says that many are called and few chosen.  Buddhism has it that all are called and few answer\\" and p. 222: Denah Joseph: \\"I have since heard fanaticism defined as `repressed doubt' [quoting Kathleen Speeth]\\"-{brackets hers}.  The last chapter is Boucher's projection to 2015: pp. 387-8: \\"Gradually we developed a practice fully grounded in the Dharma and conducive to the enlightenment of women.\\"  As a former EEO Counselor & Prevention of Sexual Harassment Trainer, I'm all for this!  But, IMHO, she spoils this by envisioning a time (p. 389) when only women are permitted to teach.  I find this as sad, disheartening, & offensive as many of the interviewed women felt about unequal treatment of nuns, leaders, etc. by Buddhist misogynists.  I'd guess that the book/poster \\"Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten\\" included: \\"two wrongs don't make a right.\\"nducive to the enlightenment of women.\\"  As a former EEO Counselor & Prevention of Sexual Harassment Trainer, I'm all for this!

The author somehow manages to convey something of the essence of each of the 18 Buddhist women interviewed.  They vary greatly: from the childlike I Tsao Fashih of the title essay to Western therapist Maura Sills.  It is not IMHO a women's or feminist book.  The chapters are divided into 4 sections: The Meditative Path, Training the Mind, The Creative Life, and Healing the World.  The interviewees are from different countries & Buddhist traditions (Theravada, Zen, Tibetan).  Some (Tenzin Palmo & Thubten Chodron) are well known Western Buddhist nuns & authors.  The chapters include art, music, therapy, physical healing, & their relation to Buddhist practice.  Several addressed Buddhism moving West: p. 45: Ayya Khema: \\"Buddhism in the West must stop expressing itself in the foreign languages of Asia and speak modern Western languages.  The Buddha [in] `The Exposition of Non-Conflict' explains that the dharma has to be learned in one's mother tongue...Diluted Buddhism pandering to society's desires becomes psychodharma which contains only partial truth\\" and p. 185: Maura Sills: \\"The older historical experiences of Buddhism should not be diluted, but they must be retranslated into ways that all people can get into.  Buddhism has become enshrouded in dogma, structures and forms.\\"  They also point out the relation between Buddhism and universal truth: p. 46: Ayya Khema: \\"Contradictions are human.  In reality there is only one truth and mystics of all ages have always found the same truth.  There is universal consciousness that can be experienced in meditation-the infinity of consciousness,\\" p. 51: Aoyama Sensei: \\"All life is seen simply as an expression of underlying universal unity.  However, our own little egos do not realize our existence emerges from a universal light source,\\" & p. 115: Haeju Sunim: \\"In the Mahayana there are the six perfections.  It is good to cultivate all of them.  However, if you practice only one very well, it is the same as practicing them all.  Through something you do very well, you are able to bring the whole sublime universe into existence.\\"  The Talmud states this principle as well.  Some, however, serve to explain Buddhist practices in terms Westerners can understand: p. 77: Myongsong Sunim: \\"If we bow to the Buddha while thinking the Buddha lives outside ourselves, this is idol worship.  If we think our mind right here is the Buddha, we are bowing to our true nature with respect, we are trying to curb thinking which would lead to self-importance.  This is the meaning of bowing\\" and p. 99: Thubten Chodron: \\"If we can change our attitude, we can change our experience.\\"  Some of their observations/realizations are more Buddhist specific or zen-like: p. 40: Ayya Khema: \\"If we grasp something, we have not realized it\\" and p. 82: Myongsong Sunim: \\"If I look in a mirror I see my face reflected in it; the reflection is neither better nor worse than my face.\\"  All in all, this book is both delightful, informative (especially of cross-cultural Buddhism), & insightful.

This is the meaning of bowing\\" and p. 99: Thubten Chodron: \\"If we can change our attitude, we can change our experience.\\"  Some of their observations/realizations are more Buddhist specific or zen-like: p. 40: Ayya Khema: \\"If we grasp something, we have not realized it\\" and p. 82: Myongsong Sunim: \\"If I look in a mirror I see my face reflected in it; the reflection is neither better nor worse than my face.\\"  All in all, this book is both delightful, informative (especially of cross-cultural Buddhism), & insightful.  Strongly recommended.	2005-03-21

She does a creditable job with each, taking her usual realistic, psychological, well-taken, insightful perspective.  For example,<br />p. 57: \\"Although we seem to be praying to Tara, we are invoking our internal wisdom and compassion.\\"<br />p. 76: \\"We wouldn't have external hindrances if we didn't have internal ones.\\"<br />pp. 94-5: \\"Although many of these verses show Tara ostensibly banishing external harms, my guess is that on a deeper level, these are analogies for internal and external obscurations.\\"<br />p. 100: Chanting \\"once with sincerity and concentration\\" is better than \\"21 times with a distracted mind.\\"<br />p. 166: \\"Guilt does not free us from self-centeredness.\\"<br />p. 167: \\"Bodhichitta is the ultimate anti-depressant.\\"<br />p. 178: \\"Meditating on the meaning of these verses isn't simply praying to Arya Tara as an external being.  We're trying to tap into our own Tara-nature, our Tara-potential.\\"<br />p. 180: \\"it is the mental transformation, not the recitations themselves, that leads to rebirth in a pure land.\\"<br /><br />She convincingly explains many Buddhist views: reasons for mantras, multiple interpretations, types of monastic vows, the 5 paths (accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, & no more learning, Tulkus (not necessarily Bodhisattvas), and (perhaps most importantly) the value and nature of Tara practice:<br />p. 21: \\"21 Taras, each of whom manifested to alleviate specific problems.

A hollow bamboo...becomes a flute.\\"  Tilopa was addressing Naropa, his highly developed disciple, and p. 182: \\"When you talk to a very developed disciple, you can bring the highest down.  When you talk to the masses you have to make compromises.\\"  Thus, this is a very advanced book.  Yet Bhagavan Shree Rajneesh speaks simply, down-to-earth, with feeling & experience.  It's my first & only Rajneesh book.  He directly implies that it is far more profound than his prior, yoga-oriented books, for MM is a great teaching.  Thus, MM is the royal/kingly way/\\"Pathless Path\\" inconsistent with polarities, doubt, good/evil, established religion, morality, & warrior-like yoga.  p. 25: \\"A moral man is never natural, cannot be.  When one is aware, anger by and by disappears.\\"  p. 117: \\"The truth, once known, is beyond all scriptures...the scriptures are nothing but fingers pointing to the moon.\\"  p. 143: A great teaching doesn't give you any commandment.  It is not concerned with what you do, it is concerned with what you are.\\"  The author cites p. 66: P. D. Ouspensky's \\"imaginazione,\\" the disease of imagination-expecting metaphor to be factual, stating: p. 150: \\"That is the meaning of Hell: all the religions have used it as a shock treatment.  Hell is nowhere, nor is there any heaven.  Both are tricks, old psychotherapeutic concepts...this is just a trick to prevent bad habits.  And heaven is a trick to help good habits.\\"  p. 205: \\"This is a beautiful game: I know myself through you, you know yourself through me, and we both don't know who we are.\\"  p. 220: The society has to be followed and transcended, the rules have to be learned and unlearned.  Rules come in your life because there are others...the rules come with relationship.\\"  p. 225: \\"A man of real understanding is neither good nor bad, he understands both.  And in that understanding he transcends both.\\"<br /><br />MM is experiential not intellectual: pp. 15-16: \\"Only that which happens to you is true.  Only that which flowers in you is true.  Only that which grows in you is true and alive.  Remember it always: avoid borrowed knowledge.\\"  Thus, the nature of thoughts is revealed: p. 35: \\"You are the host and thoughts are the guests,\\" p. 35: \\"A thing is a thought, a thought is a thing,\\" and p. 87-8: \\"watch your thoughts ...watching must be passive, not active...There is no eagerness, no urgency, no emergency...Be a passive watcher.\\"  Furthermore, he emphasizes spontaneous, natural action vs. past-based, habitual activity: p. 151-2: \\"Response is alive to the situation, reaction is just an ingrained habit...Reaction is ugly, response is beautiful.  Reaction is partial/thinking; response is natural/whole being...If your life becomes a life of response and spontaneity, you will become some day a Buddha.  Habit kills life.  Habit is against life...you are following a dead discipline.\\"  And p. 229: \\"People who are too occupied in activities are afraid of themselves.  Activity is a sort of escape; they can forget themselves in it.  It is alcoholic, itis an intoxicant.  Activity has to be dropped, action is beautiful.  What is action?  Action is a response: when it is needed you act; when it is not needed you relax...Talking can be either activity or action...Until the sentence is uttered even I am not aware what it is going to be.  Not only are you the listener; I am also a listener here.\\"  He also describes masters & meditation as means to the ends of MM: p. 139-140: \\"A master is nothing but a personified phenomenon of the total bliss...a master is not a teacher...a master is a presence...A master is found through feeling.  A teacher is found though thinking.\\"  p. 190-1: \\"A master is to help you unlearn...meditation is a witnessing, not a technique; meditation is an understanding awareness...Techniques are just to bridge the gap.\\"  The author effectively uses many teaching stories such as the Mulla Nasrudin (made famous by Idries Shah), drawing from many religious traditions, and refutes intolerance, citing the temporary insanity defense (p. 62)-since sentient beings are essentially unconscious.  My only criticism is his not referencing Kabbalah parallels (devekut, yichud, ein sof) to many of his statements-rather he says p. 22: \\"You can't translate Buddhist understanding into Jewish terminology\\" referring to Jesus.  Further, he says that one can't eat meat with self-remembering; though p. 210: Tilopa says: \\"Mahamudra is beyond all acceptance and rejection.\\"  So, there's a slight cultural bias-though much less than the vast majority of religious books.

The author makes some profound statements about questions: p. 7: \\"In the beginning one should remain skeptical and rely on questioning and checking the teachings based on one's understanding\\" and p. 9: \\"I believe that spiritual practice is more about holding questions than finding answers.  Seeking one correct answer often comes from a wish to make life-which is basically fluid-into something certain and fixed.\\"  The latter applies directly to Buddhism itself: p. 77-8: \\"As the Buddha's teachings spread from one country to another, they adapted to the culture and mentality of the people in each place without changing the essential meaning...The external forms and ways of doing things are not the Dharma.\\"  Thus, she differentiates between true practitioners and p. 118: \\"joss stick Buddhists.\\"  Needless to say, this book is for people truly interested in or at least honestly curious about Buddhism.

The author, a former Buddhist nun, provides an extensive introduction including an autobiographical account-virtually a 7th biography.  She provides much valuable information about the Buddha families, biography vs. sacred biography or hagiography, and Tibetan traditions and terminology such as delogs (people who die and come back to life), Togdens (Tibetan yogis), etc.  The six sacred biographies included here vary considerably in length (2 are quite long and 4 are rather short) and in nature (some include much more hyperbole and others are more historical).  The author states on p. 54 that \\"Goodness is not necessarily truth.\\"  She also provides a prolog and extremely valuable endnotes for each chapter, suggesting that (p. 215) the reason for embedding teachings into a biography is to make them come to life.<br /><br />She also provides psychological explanations for a number of otherwise fantastic descriptions and activities, frequently based upon the writings of Jung's disciple Esther Harding:<br /><br />p. 147: \\"When we think of a demon, we generally think of an external spirit which attacks us, but Machig realized the true nature of demons is the internal functioning of the ego...all four demons are thought-processes which block a state of clear, unattached awareness.\\"<br /><br />p. 195 note 62: \\"If we understand the serpentine underwater Nagas as a manifestation of Machig's unconscious, as part of her own mind, this assumption being based on the idea that our environment is a manifestation of our karma and our own projection.\\"  Other contemporary books support such a view: Loren Pederson's \\"Dark Hearts,\\" George Weinberg's \\"Invisible Masters,\\" & John Sanford's \\"Invisible Partners.\\"<br /><br />Further, she also clears up the ambiguity about Tibetan Buddhist practitioners consuming meat:<br /><br />p. 194 note 54: \\"the Buddha did not teach strict vegetarianism, but rather that all meat one eats should have passed through at least three hands before a Buddhist should consume it...if a Tantric practitioner eats the meat of an animal with awareness and transcendent insight into the true nature of reality, this creates a connection between the animal and the yogi, and therefore the animal will have a much better chance of reaching a higher rebirth than if it had not been killed and offered to the yogi or yogini.  Also...it symbolizes going beyond the limitations of vows and conventional `goodness,' and transformation of poison and dangerous substances into a means for enlightenment.  Therefore a big piece of meant would be an appropriate offering for a Tantric initiation.\\"  Interestingly, this practice parallels that of Kabbalah where practitioners raise the spiritual level of animals by eating them with proper kavvanah (mystical intention).s should have passed through at least three hands before a Buddhist should consume it...if a Tantric practitioner eats the meat of an animal with awareness and transcendent insight into the true nature of reality, this creates a connection between the animal and the yogi, and therefore the animal will have a much better chance of reaching a higher rebirth than if it had not been killed and offered to the yogi or yogini.

The 1st 3 are a mixture of popular psychology and Buddhism.  Much of the material is familiar to readers of  psychology bestsellers, but Bhikshuni (an honorific for Buddhist nuns) Chodron makes some pithy statements worth repeating:<br /><br />p. 92: \\"If we complain that our parents don't understand and accept us for who we are, we also must ask whether we understand and accept our parents for who they are.\\"<br /><br />p. 134: \\"A person who accepts responsibility for his decision is in a position to effect great change in his life while someone who continuously attributes his failures and confusion to others digs himself into a hole...But when we take responsibility for our decisions...then we give ourselves the power to change.\\"<br /><br />p. 139: \\"It is very good for children to see their parents sit still and be calm.  That gives them the idea that they too can do the same.\\"  These are reminiscent of the works of Alice Miller on children emulating parents as well as other books on reframing and positive transformation.  Vajrayana is, to a large extent, also about positive transformation: p. 145: \\"If we direct our mind positively, we can transfer whatever action we do into the path to enlightenment.\\"<br /><br />In part 4, she describes the spread of Buddhism including concise, yet easily understood, descriptions of various types of Buddhism and how they are practiced in different lands (including monastics): p. 157: \\"Buddhism is remarkably flexible in the external forms it takes.  Thus it has adapted to the culture of each country where it has taken root.\\"  She points out that there are different ways of viewing Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as well as parallels between Buddhism and western religions.  In part 5, she discusses Buddhism today with intimations of its future in the West, stating that: p. 191: \\"Buddhism in the 21st century faces two challenges.  The first is to clarify people's misconceptions about it.\\"  This book appears to be so-aimed; her no nonsense approach and understanding of the dynamics of religious development answer that challenge-in a way that is understandable in the West.  Thus, she states that: p. 4: \\"In fact, our self or `I' exists but not in the way we think it does.\\"  As in the Middle Way of the Madhyamaka, she takes the middle ground and promotes a balanced approach and understanding of others' perspectives vice rejecting them for being different.

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche expands each to about 1 1/2 small pages.  Dilgo Khyentse was a great master who died not very long ago.  He was a leader in the nonsectarian Rime movement which promoted study of all of the 4 schools of Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana).  The present Dalai Lama does likewise.  However, about 1/2 of this book is about motivating people to practice using the approach of the 4 Noble Truths.  Thus, it's extremely basic.  The other 1/2 isn't much more advanced though Rinpoche does utilize some colorful imagery to communicate his position.  It does not go into what practice means and it provides little (if any) new material to the practitioner.  It could serve as a refresher for someone needing reinforcement for his or her practice, but its approach is primarily negative -- i.e. if you don't practice...I'm sure there are folks who will love this book, but I didn't find much depth in it.	2005-03-08

It includes her motivations and obstacles to this decision, her main claim to fame-a 12 year solitary retreat in a cave in the snowy mountains of northern India, and the effects of her Buddhist experiences on her life thereafter.  While she does not elaborate on the cave experiences or realizations themselves (no doubt very personal and difficult to explain to a general audience), Ani Palmo (Ani is an honorific for a Buddhist nun or Bhikshuni) makes a number of forceful and discerning observations and conclusions:<br /><br />--monastic life: p. 72: \\"We also have to learn not to be attached to simplicity and poverty.\\"<br /><br />--literal interpretation of mythology: p. 173: `Frightening people with tales of hell is counter-productive-it just makes them want to give up.\\"<br /><br />--religious development via transplanting: p. 188: Different aspects of the dharma emerge when they resonate with certain qualities in the psyches of the people it is meeting.  It's an absolutely necessary process if Buddhism is going to be applicable to one's own country.\\"<br /><br />--Western seeds of Buddhism: p. 167: \\"'Ground Hog Day' was a very Buddhist movie\\"<br /><br />--monastic teachers:  p. 165: Confusion and problems arose, for the lamas, used to addressing the very specialized congregation of monks, had no precedent of how to deliver the Buddha dharma in terms applicable to householders, professionals, and women of the West.\\"<br /><br />--the emergence of Western Buddhism: p. 188: I think the skillful incorporation of certain psychological principles is going to be very significant.  I also like the idea of social involvement, of genuinely going out there to help others rather tan just sitting on the meditation cushion thinking about it.  It's opening the heart through practical application and it suits the West...Buddhism will not be rooted in the West until some Western people have gone and taken the dharma and eaten it and digested it and then give it back in a form which is right for Westerners.\\"<br /><br />She correctly observes that while Buddhism changes people (and perhaps even cultures), nations and their peoples also change Buddhism.  It's reciprocal.  Thus, her dynamic efforts to liberate Buddhist women reflects prior Western efforts: suffrage, sexual harassment, etc. in America and elsewhere.  It is a natural reflection of cultural interaction as well as the inner response (despite her awesome need for solitude and individual efforts towards Enlightenment) of an amazing woman to an obvious need for evolvement within Tibetan Buddhism itself.  One can only applaud and support her sacrifice for her sisters as well as Buddhism and the Western psyche.rn people have gone and taken the dharma and eaten it and digested it and then give it back in a form which is right for Westerners.\\" <br /> <br />She correctly observes that while Buddhism changes people (and perhaps even cultures), nations and their peoples also change Buddhism.

The Dalai Lama does NOT dispute this but dedicates a significant portion of his book (actually a collection of oral presentations given mostly in California in the late `80's) to \\"the correspondence between Highest Yoga Tantra and Dzogchen\\" (p. 120) per Dodrupchen Jikme Tenpe Nyima (1865-1926).  Highest Yoga Tantra is the highest teaching of his own Gelugpa School.  He points out both similarities and differences, compares it to Mahamudra (the highest teaching of the Kagyu School), the highest teaching of the Sakya School, and the Madhyamaka Prasangika philosophy as well.  However, as he states on p. 176: \\"I am explaining Dzogchen, but in order to explain it, at this point I shall employ the vocabulary of the new schools of tantra.\\"  At least for me, he cleared up considerable ambiguity/confusion regarding the differences between this philosophy (now dominant in Tibet) and the Cittamatra.<br /><br />Thus, this is NOT an introductory text.  In fact, it's quite uneven-but then it wasn't written, it was a series of lectures.  It includes some extremely basic Buddhist material (including his referring to the Southern Buddhism Schools as the \\"Fundamental Vehicle\\" on p. 98).  This, as well as the final lecture, reflects his great compassion for all-emulating Avalokiteshvara & Tara.  Indeed, he discusses some very erudite subjects with great sensitivity: emptiness (the 4 empties), free will, & (especially) context.  He states:<br /><br />p. 143: \\"there are many different presentations of emptiness.\\"<br /><br />p. 144: \\"it is very important to examine what the reference of any particular term may be.\\"<br /><br />p. 160: \\"even though the context may appear to be similar, we cannot assume that a particular term will retain the same meaning whenever it occurs.\\"<br /><br />Most of this book is a comparison of Dzogchen with other systems rather than an exposition of its methods-perhaps its sub-title might be amended.  However, one lecture is a wonderful commentary on Patrul Rinpoche's \\"The Special Teaching of the Wise and Glorious King\\" which demonstrates the Dalai Lama's great erudition, knowledge of Dzogchen, and his rare ability to translate complex concepts into simple language.  He chose this text because it is (p. 91) \\"quite short but of great substance.\\"  He also makes a very enlightening (for me) statement about a particular Dzogchen technique:<br /><br />p. 56: sky gazing: \\"direct your gaze toward the space between you and external phenomena.\\"ook is a comparison of Dzogchen with other systems rather than an exposition of its methods-perhaps its sub-title might be amended.

It includes extensive Q&A; 8 photos, and a great number of quotable quotes.  Ani Palmo (Ani is an honorific for a Buddhist nun) is VERY down-to-earth and realistic and relates a considerable about of advice and commentary from her Lama.  She points out that Tibetan mythological themes should not be taken literally-even Tibetan teachers indicate this.  For example:<br /><br />pp. 61-2: \\"Shantideva says, `Who made the red-hot iron floors?  All this is a projection of the personal mind.'  Even if we don't believe in the physical reality of the hell realms, we can definitely believe that a mind filled with anger, which loves harming others and takes pleasure in cruelty, could easily project a paranoid environment for itself...the content of our inner mind is projected outward and becomes our entire reality.\\"  Furthermore, she invokes valid psychological principles such as: p. 67: \\"Those who deny the shadow are in a very insecure and precarious position...It is hard to develop true compassion when you are continuously blanking out all suffering from your own life.\\"  Also, Sociological principles: p. 81: \\"Today the West is making a significant contribution to the way the Dharma is presented.  Every time the Buddhadharma travels to a new country, that country gives it something of itself.\\"<br /><br />Ani Palmo, in a highly readable and understandable style, provides pithy advice to practitioners: p. 93: \\"We need to dissolve the boundary between the subject and the object.  In other words, we need to become the meditation\\" & p. 102: \\"Worldly desires are like salty water.  The more you drink, the thirstier you get...The problem is the way we cling to things\\" & p. 141: \\"Our problem is that we believe our mind and identify with it.\\"  She also provides logical explanations for many Vajrayana practices: p. 95: \\"intricate visualizations of mandalas...totally occupy the mind so that there is no room for distraction.\\"  She provides considerable, pragmatic material on relationships between Vajrayana and Western religions: p. 96: \\"All true religions seek to gain access to that level of consciousness which is not ego-bound.  In Buddhism it is called the unconditional, the unborn, the deathless.  You can call it anything you like.  You can call it atman.  You can call it anatman.  You can call it God.\\"  She also provides a number of intriguing teaching stories such as p. 103: monkeys captured by refusing to let go of a sweet--: \\"If you want to hold water, you have to hold it with cupped hands.  If you make a tight fist, it runs away\\" and of a king unattached to his palace with a guru attached to his gourd.  She also observes that the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\" can be interpreted as a Buddhist film about reincarnation and karma.<br /><br />And, best of all, Ani Palmo provides quotes which defuse misconceptions concerning Buddhist doctrines: p. 156: \\"The Buddha said, `I too use conceptualization, but I am no longer fooled by it.\\"<br /><br />pp. 159-160: \\"Difficult Points for Westerners\\" chapter: \\"The Buddha replied, `do not take anything on trust merely because it has passed down through tradition, or because your teachers say it, or because your elders have taught you, or because it's written in some famous scripture.  When you have seen it and experienced it for yourself to be right and true, then you can accept it.'\\"  However, the one criticism might be that she fails to apply this regarding: p. 238: Eastern images & p. 241: Tibetan lineages.<br /><br />p. 166: \\"According to the Buddhadharma, the most important component of any action of body, speech, or mind is intention.\\"<br /><br />p. 168: when asked about hell, her \\"Lama just laughed and said, `Oh well, we talk that way in order to frighten people into being good.  Actually, it is very difficult to be reborn in hell.  You have to be especially evil, and particularly, very cruel.'\\"<br /><br />p. 169: \\"My Lama once said, `Not everything you read in the sutras is true.  You don't have to believe everything you read.' ... The Tibetans took from that huge ocean a few drops of this and a few drops of that and put it together into a mixture which was helpful for Tibetans.  Much of it is relevant for the rest of us as well.  The ways they present the Dharma is wonderful.  But there is no doubt that certain aspects, although helpful for them, are not very helpful for us.  We can leave those aside.\\"  Higher teachings often contradict lower teachings and not everything is appropriate for everybody.<br /><br />p. 191: \\"Some Tibetans say it's almost impossible to realize the nature of the mind without a teacher.  I don't think that's true.  Some people do realize the nature of mind spontaneously without a teacher.  But a good teacher helps.\\"<br /><br />She also provides valuable observations and techniques on Vajrayana practices: pp. 179-180: in utilizing tonglen - \\"black pearl-like seed of self-cherishing at our heart center...sometimes instead of a black pearl...we can visualize a crystal Vajra which represents our innate Dharmakaya mind.  The dark light absorbs into this and is instantly transformed into radiance, since no darkness exists within the pristine nature of the mind.\\"  p. 235: \\"My Lama always said to me, `Don't undertake big commitments.  Keep your practice very small and simple, but do it.' ... I have always been very clear with lamas when it comes to initiations.  Sorry, I am not keeping this commitment.

Jung, Volume 11)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Not an easy read, but worth the trouble/expense	This lengthy tome, while not an easy read and including rather detailed analyses of certain Christian processes as well as the less than scientific (but certainly different) Answer to Job, provides a number of wise observations on the psychology of religion, applicable to both Eastern and Western religious traditions.  Some of his main areas of cross-religious focus are:<br /><br />Belief vs. Thought:<br /><br />p. 110 \\"People who believe and don't think always forget that they continually expose themselves to their own worst enemy: doubt.  Wherever belief reigns, doubt lurks in the background.  But thinking people welcome doubt: it serves them as a valuable stepping-stone to better knowledge.  People who can believe should be a little more tolerant with those of their fellows who are only capable of thinking.  Belief has already conquered the summit which thinking tries to win by toilsome climbing.  The believer ought not to project his habitual enemy, doubt, upon the thinker, thereby suspecting him of destructive designs...let the believer rejoice that others, too, seek to climb the mountain on whose peak he sits.\\"<br /><br />p. 449 \\"Irritability, bad moods, and outbursts of affect are the classic symptoms of chronic virtuousness.\\"<br /><br />The Statistical Distribution of Human Development In Terms of Years and Historical Periods:<br /><br />p. 308 \\"There are people who, psychologically, might be living in the year 5000 B. C., i.e., who can still successfully solve their conflicts as people did seven thousand years ago.  There are countless troglodytes and barbarians living in Europe and in all civilized countries, as well as a large number of medieval Christians.  On the other hand, there are relatively few who have reached the level of consciousness which is possible in our time.  We must also reckon with the fact that a few of our generation belong to the third or fourth millennium A. D. and are consequently anachronistic.\\"<br /><br />p. 333-5: \\"It takes about twenty years for the ordinary run of people to begin thinking the thoughts of the educated person of today...it takes about twenty years for the general outlook and problems of the educated to percolate down to the uneducated masses.\\"<br /><br />The nature of human development through neuroses and withdrawal of projections (when a person projects his or her inner perspectives, problems, etc. onto the external world or onto other people, thus denying the internal origin of the projection-and associating it with denial of responsibility for it).  Jung's Individuation process involves integrating the split off pieces of one's personality-including projections.  The process implies accepting oneself rather than condemning one's faults.<br /><br />p. 43 \\"fairly complete human beings are exceptions.  It is true that an overwhelming majority of educated people are fragmentary personalities and have a lot of substitutes instead of the genuine goods.\\"<br /><br />p. 85 \\"the development of consciousness requires the withdrawal of all the projections we can lay our hands on.\\"<br /><br />p. 256 \\"So long as they are unconscious our unconscious contents are always projected, and the projection fixes upon everything `ours,' inanimate objects as well as animals and people...they are more than what they are in themselves and function as such.\\"<br /><br />p. 339 \\"We cannot change anything unless we accept it.  Condemnation does not liberate; it oppresses...if the doctor wishes to help a human being he must be able to accept him as he is.  And he can do this in reality only when he has already seen and accepted himself as he is.\\"<br /><br />Psychological problems can result from resisting this process; resulting neuroses and suffering help to spur on the process despite egoistic attempts to derail it:<br /><br />p. 75 \\"neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.\\"<br /><br />p. 350 \\"A neurosis is never more complicated than the person who has it.\\"<br /><br />p. 335 \\"withthe decline of religious life, the neuroses grow noticeably more frequent.\\"<br /><br />Thus, the religions (spiritual) life can be identified with Individuation as opposed to neurosis.  Further:<br /><br />p. 283 \\"A concrete event by itself can never create meaning, but is largely dependent for this on the manner in which it is understood.\\"<br /><br />p. 339 \\"simple things are always the most difficult.  In actual life it requires the greatest art to be simple.\\"<br /><br />Such an approach (to simplicity and creation of meaning) implies further similarity between psychology and religion (West and East).grow noticeably more frequent.\\" <br /> <br />Thus, the religions (spiritual) life can be identified with Individuation as opposed to neurosis.

This one includes comments on several Buddhist texts (as have some of his others).  However, this one is a bit more practical than the others--it includes some guidance on the 4 Immeasurables practices (loving kindness, compassion, equanimity, and joy--especially in others' happiness), Bodhichitta (Buddha Mind or universal compassion), and Shamatha or Shine (Calm or Tranquil Abiding).  The last is the basic form of Tibetan Buddhist (Vajrayana) meditation.  It is an essential starting point towards enlightenment--included in virtually all schools of Buddhism from Theravada (SE Asia) to Dzogchen and Mahamudra.  All these teachings are presented in His Holiness' gentle, compassionate style, reflecting his own nature.  I had the great fortune to meet him for a brief moment in Washington, DC and, IMHO, he is the most present and sincere and real person I've met.  The value of his work (s) IMHO is more a reflection of what he is than who he is or what he says or writes.	2005-02-25

Ani is a title for Buddhist Nuns or Bhikshunis.  She is spiritual director of Gampo Abbey (named for the medieval master Gampopa).  However, only 4 chapters were excluded.  Its size is conducive to carrying it around with you for inspiration or to share with others (I tend to give away books after reading them).  Its major points include: not preferring samsara (the usual, relative world) to nirvana (the ultimate world), integrating taught and experienced Dharma (teachings), (p. 122): playfulness-learning to play like a raven in the wind, Tonglen (sending and receiving practice), Bodhichitta (compassion), and the wheel of life.  It includes some less than obvious observations such as:<br /><br />p. 28: \\"the desire to change fundamentally a form of aggression toward oneself...If you throw out your neurosis, you also throw out your wisdom.\\"<br /><br />p. 60: Life is such a miracle, and a lot of the time we feel only resentment about how it's all working out for us.\\"<br /><br />It also includes some of her wonderful teaching stories:<br /><br />pp. 65-7: samurai who asked a master to explain heaven and hell<br /><br />pp. 75-7: God with ½ red and ½ blue hat walking down the middle of a street.<br /><br />So, you can read \\"Wisdom of No Escape\\" for completeness, but consider owning a copy of \\"Awakening Loving Kindness\\" too.	2005-02-23

It addresses Jigme Lingpa's \\"Longchen Nyingtig\\" cycle of Termas (Treasure Texts) including discovered texts, texts resulting from \\"pure visions\\" of 14th century Dzogchen master Longchenpa while Jigme Lingpa (18th century) was in retreat, and supporting texts authored by Jigme Lingpa.  All but one of these texts has been included in both English and Tibetan.  Van Schaik's introductory material focuses upon certain main themes: simultaneous vs. gradual approaches to Dzogchen (the Treasure Texts focus mostly on the former and the Supporting Texts mainly on the latter), the relationship of Jigme Lingpa to his contemporaries and with Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism) vs. Dzogchen vs. Mahamudra.  His emphasis on gradualist approaches is explained as a practical approach and he attempts to reconcile the two.  I don't think Lingpa totally succeeds in this, however.  By taking a gradualist approach, he incorporates much basic Vajrayana material (including extensive preliminary practices) which are, at least on the surface, antithetical to the Dzogchen view (being dualistic, for example).  He also uses the Mahamudra 12 stage descriptive process and provides parallels with other systems (e.g. the Prajnaparamita or Perfection of Wisdom sutras).  The dichotomy between simultaneous and gradual parallels that between immanence (Buddha nature) & distinction (transcendence)-a situation not unlike that of the theistic Western religions.  While Jigme Lingpa relies considerably upon his discarnate master Longchenpa (many quotes are provided), his emphasis upon Vajrayana practices goes way beyond, IMHO, that of Longchenpa (Longchen Rabjam)-as discussed by van Schaik.<br /><br />Van Schaik has done us a great service in providing translations of these texts.  The Termas include discussions of the mind vs. mind itself, wisdom/gnosis vs. emptiness (not the same), and use of symbols (p. 137: \\"the host of male and female bodhisattvas who are the pure senses, sense objects, and times\\").  The pure visions somewhat parallel the Termas (p. 168: \\"The original general ground is a state like the sky; the ground's manifestation, gnosis, is like clouds dispersing in the sky\\").  The supporting texts include a number of wonderful quotes for my collection such as:<br /><br />pp. 209-10: \\"having distinguished between reflexive awareness (which is all-penetrating primordial wisdom) and mind (which is nescient conceptualization and delusive forms), you should maintain freedom from limits in the state of the vast spacious expanse of gnosis, without following after it.  Through this, the imprints of the conceptual mind are purified, and errors and straying are cut off.\\"<br /><br />p. 236: \\"The agent of the recognition of thoughts and emotions should be put to one side without giving him any importance like the unconcerned disinterest of an old man watching a child at play.\\"<br /><br />p. 237: \\"Appearances, emptiness, and union are just words, names, and terms.\\"<br /><br />p. 238: \\"Even this Vajra song is like the play of optical illusions.\\"<br /><br />In summary, this is a book for the serious Dzogchen student to keep as reference.symbols (p. 137: \\"the host of male and female bodhisattvas who are the pure senses, sense objects, and times\\").

US	30672120	R1JK58JBS1K597	1564558118	115711722	Pure Meditation	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Fine Introduction to Buddhist meditation	This 2-cassette set reflects the author's usual warmth, humor, kindliness, and down-to-earth approach to improving one's life through Buddhist means.  The author is a western Buddhist nun teaching at a monastery in Nova Scotia, Canada.  This set focuses on Buddhist meditation consisting of tranquil abiding (Shamatha or shine) with some insight meditation (vipashyana).  Thus, it differs from her many other books (e.g. \\"Places that Scare You\\"), tapes (e.g. \\"Awakening Compassion\\"), and video (\\"Good Medicine\\") which primarily address the Lojong mind training.  She does include a smattering of it here as well as some discussion of Bodhichitta - an approach to the mind of a Buddha.  She stresses having loyalty to your life's experiences-even using the terms \\"Being Here\\" (the title of Peter Sellers' last movie which is actually quite appropriate here) and \\"Be Here Now\\" (the title of Baba Ram Dass' best seller of yesteryear).  This includes having the courage to experience discomfort, to change one's worldview, and face one's emotions squarely.  In the latter she provides a technique to utilize them to your advantage by dumping the words and keeping the energy.  Ani Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's (she is a Buddhist nun, thus the title Ani) wonderful turns of phrase include: \\"The places of meeting your edge are the places of tantrum,\\" \\"emptiness is openness.\\"  She also provides stories such as the man who went into a coma, was transported elsewhere, and thought he was dead when he woke up-and lived the rest of is life that way.  My only criticism of this set is that it's too short so that it can only cover the highlights of meditation.  I'd recommend the works of her friend Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche or of Bokar Rinpoche for more detail.	2005-02-04

Karma, law of cause & effect, like Newton's Law, is described with quotes (p. 43): Tsongkhapa said: \\"Miserliness is the way to become poor, not rich.  Generosity is the means to become rich, not poor\\" & Sakya Pandita said, \\"The result of generosity is always richness, the result of miserliness is always poverty.\\"  Thus, what happens to us is the result of our own past actions in this life or prior ones:<br /><br />  \\"In short then, whenever unfortunate sufferings<br /><br />We haven't desired crash upon us like thunder,<br /><br />  This is the same as the smith who had taken<br /><br />His life with a sword he had fashioned himself.<br /><br />  Our suffering is the wheel of sharp weapons returning<br /><br />Full circle upon us from wrongs we have done.<br /><br />  Hereafter let's always have care and awareness<br /><br />Never to act in non-virtuous ways.\\"  (p. 12, stanza 46)<br /><br />Bodhichitta is compassion for others (at the relative level) vs. self-absorption.  Shantideva says (p. 57, stanza 46): \\"All calamities in the world arise from cherishing self, while all fortune arises from cherishing others.\\"  Thus, Bodhichitta, selflessness, and karma are related.  As Dhargyey states \\"The enemy is self-grasping and his attendant is the self-cherishing thought (p. 62, stanza 53).<br /><br />\\"We have selfish desires and horrible anger  Which fester inside us, we would never admit;<br /><br />Yet without provocation we criticize others  And self-righteously charge them with faults we possess.<br /><br />Trample him, trample him, dance on the head  Of this treacherous concept of selfish concern.<br /><br />Tear out the heart of this self-centered butcher  Who slaughters our chance to gain final release.<br /><br />  (p. 18, stanza 68)<br /><br />Dhargyey provides a teaching stories: (p. 61, stanza 51): \\"Once there was an old cat who was no longer able to catch mice, so he told them that, as he had vowed against killing, they could circumambulate him every day.  In this way he was able to catch the last of them.\\"  The text also describes Tonglen = mental giving and receiving-attuning with others' suffering and send them our happiness:<br /><br />\\"As all that is wrong can be traced to one source-Our concern for ourselves whom we cherish the most-  We must meditate now on the kindness of others.<br /><br />Accepting the suffering that they never wished for, We must dedicate fully our virtues to all.<br /><br />  (p. 25, stanza 96)<br /><br />The text is beautiful whether you agree with karma, reincarnation or not.  The author points out (pp. 28 & 82, stanza 110) that things are not necessarily as they appear and states (p. 87), \\"We too should study the thoughts and tenets of others in order to understand our own school of thought.\\"(p. 18, stanza 68) <br />Dhargyey provides a teaching stories: (p. 61, stanza 51): \\"Once there was an old cat who was no longer able to catch mice, so he told them that, as he had vowed against killing, they could circumambulate him every day.

These are preceded by a brief historical introduction which, interestingly, conflicts with Samten Karmay's historical information in \\"Secret Visions of the Fifth Dalai Lama.\\"  The 7th's poems are based on Atisha's Lojong (mind) training received from Dharmakirti in Indonesia.  This is also the basis from much of Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's books and tapes.  But these poems are moralistic in character (mostly proscriptive) whereas hers which are experiential and practical (mostly prescriptive).  The stanzas here are in the form of questions and answers: (p. 85): \\"Who is the mule braying his inferiority to others?  He who praises himself to others, saying, `I have this and that good quality.'\\"  They are sometimes humorous and generally down-to-earth: (p. 88): \\"What is like a smelly fart that although invisible, is obvious?  One's own faults that are precisely as obvious as the effort made to hide them.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Mullin provides considerable commentary which adds a great number of basic Buddhist & Vajrayana precepts, principles, etc. as good background, but not necessarily taking them literally: (p. 27) \\"metaphorically the 6 realms of the sensory world represent cyclic processes resulting from the 6 distorted mind-states...\\"  He notes the 7th's link to the Kadampa school (p. 85), the practice of yelling praises and insults to yourself in a cave (presumably with an echo) on page 90, the Lojong perspective-(p. 137): \\"Ordinary people react to personal criticism by becoming defensive or even angry.  In the Lojong tradition one always cultivates the opposite of the ordinary,\\" and some interesting assertions such as-(p. 63): \\"The biggest obstacle to enlightenment in the kaliyuga is the temptation to follow the norms of society, for society is mostly on the wrong track.\\"  However, I think he overstates the case when he states that (p. 22) \\"The 7th Dalai Lama's little text focuses upon the meeting place of these 2 levels of reality-conventional & ultimate-and upon how the flows that manifest on the conventional level of reality can be directed so as to create outer an inner environments within which the ultimate level of reality is easily perceived.\\"<br /><br />Rather, the text seems more like a Jewish Musar (morals) text such as Luzzatto's \\"The Path of the Just\\" and is very, IMHO, basic.  For instance, (p. 151): \\"What is the harm not to be inflicted upon others?  The very harm one would not like to have inflicted upon oneself\\" is identical to Hillel's comment in the Talmud and very similar to Christianity's Golden Rule.  In Buddhism, however, one of the abilities of a Buddha is to know what people need.  Thus, it seems to me that Buddhism could rephrase this better as: do unto others only what they need done unto them.  After all, what you want & what another wants/needs are not always the same.  Still, with the commentary it could be a good starter book for someone interested in learning about Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism).  For a more advanced student, and especially for a prospective practitioner, I'd recommend works by Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n, Surya Das, or Chogyam Trungpa over this one.  I think my lack of enthusiasm for this book is exacerbated by its not IMHO living up to its title.  Nevertheless, it did have a quote or two for my collection.

Interestingly, there are contradictions with the history in Glenn Mullin's \\"Gems of Wisdom from the 7th Dalai Lama!  If you like this type of history, you might also like Karmay's \\"The Great Perfection.\\"  In the present work, he provides a translation of the 5th's numerous Tantric visions as described in the secret work not included in the 5ths official bibliography (only given to a few close followers).  This text is accompanied by dozens of colorful (sometimes beautiful) plates with black backgrounds (per the originals) from a rare manuscript in a French museum.  Each plate has a line drawing with numbered identifications of the items on the plate.  There is, of course, much duplication though there are some differences among the paraphrenalia used in the various Tantric rites.  There's even one on Dzogchen.  Some of the items are a bit grisly, however, such as dead bodies, skulls filled with blood, dead animals/birds, etc.  The items remind one of a contemporary horror movie, but the ceremonies are not actually described though so they are open to one's imagination.  They provide some insight into the tremendous dichotomy between ancient ritual and the high philosophy (e.g. Dzogchen) of Tibet.	2005-02-01
US	30672120	R3Q5NQM1J5D87Z	1559391766	786945942	Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: The Five Elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen	Books	5	60	61	N	Y	Opens new horizons of understanding	This is a very unusual book in that it combines ancient B&ouml;n elemental practices which (on the surface) appear to be mythological if not superstitious with extremely advanced Dzogchen spiritual practices.  However, the author takes care to note the psychological interpretation of much of the ancient symbols and techniques.  For instance, on page 1, he says: \\"As in most cultures, the Tibetan tradition uses the natural elements as fundamental metaphors to describe forces both internal and external.  For example, physical properties are assigned to the elements: earth is solidity; water is cohesion; fire is temperature; air is motion; and space is the spatial dimension that accommodates the other four active elements...The metaphoric use of the elements is also common in Western languages: a person can be earthy or spacey, fluid or fiery.  Anger is hot, sadness is watery.  Attitudes can be airy or grounded.\\"  Furthermore, he points out (p. 6): \\"It's easy to lose the sense of the sacred in the modern world.\\"  Thus, (p. 92) he emphasizes \\"Understanding how to apply all experience to the path of meditation.\\"  He does this by including a great many exercises of very varying method (physical postures, breathing, visualization, etc.) including (p. 55) supermarket offerings, (p. 60): \\"Retrieving the elemental energies,\\" (p. 92): \\"Holding and Releasing,\\" and (pp. 93-109): external, internal, and secret (mental) Tsa Lung Movements to activate the chakras (demonstrated with line drawings).<br /><br />He includes dedicated chapters outlining the relationships between the elements & Tantra and between the elements & Dzogchen.  These include a short commentary on the (p. 113-120): \\"The Six Lamps\\" text, reference to his master Lopon Tenzin Namdak Rinpoche's (p. 123): \\"Heart Drops of Dharmakaya\\" & its rushen practice, (pp. 125-6) Trekch&ouml;d & T&ouml;gal, and (p. 130) dark retreat.  He describes our normal perception (p. 119): \\"We hear an unknown sound and ask what it is.  We get an answer, and the next time the sound arises we hear it less and think it more.\\"  But, he succinctly describes the experience of Rigpa (pp. 118-9): \\"When we abide in Rigpa, what we experience as external is less substantial.  Our identities are less substantial.  Our problems are less substantial.  We experience Rigpa everywhere; there is no difference between inside and outside the body.  There is no difference between meditation and non-meditation...If all phenomena, including the subjective sense of self, are recognized as an empty display of space and light, one is free.  Then whatever arises is simply an ornament of pure being.\\"  And, he provides an incredibly concise description of Dzogchen (pp. 125-6): \\"Dzogchen practice can be summed up like this: Recognize non-dual innate awareness, dissolve all identity in it, and abide without distraction.\\"and the next time the sound arises we hear it less and think it more.\\"  But, he succinctly describes the experience of Rigpa (pp. 118-9): \\"When we abide in Rigpa, what we experience as external is less substantial.  Our identities are less substantial.  Our problems are less substantial.  We experience Rigpa everywhere; there is no difference between inside and outside the body.

This set focuses on the 4 Immeasurables or limitless qualities: Maitri (loving-kindness), compassion, joy, and equanimity.  She points out where her master, Trungpa Rinpoche digressed from the literal meanings of these four in practice as well as certain modifications suggested by the great 14th century master, Longchenpa (Longchen Rabjam).  For example, the latter suggested meditating upon equanimity to stabilize prior to sending out loving kindness etc.  Embedded in the technique is to send these 4 out consecutively, but within each \\"sending\\" to first apply it to someone you care about, then a neutral, then someone you mildly dislike (building up to stronger feelings), and finally to everyone.  For example, compassion is the wish that everyone be free of suffering and the cause of suffering.  Trungpa Rinpoche's modifications include: joy being the appreciation of peoples' basic goodness.  Ani Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's (she is a Buddhist nun, thus the title Ani) wonderful turns of phrase include: \\"We look for strength in what weakens us,\\" \\"We've gotten really good at making matters worse,\\" and seeking happiness without a hangover.  My only problem with this set is that it's too short!  Also, since it doesn't include the practice of Tonglen and some of her other main teachings, I'd recommend the 6-tape \\"Awakening Compassion\\" or \\"Noble Heart\\" set over this one.  It includes virtually all of this one plus much more-but then it's longer and costs more.  If you haven't had the great uplifting joy of experiencing Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's tapes, this would be a fine one to start with.  She's also written a number of fine books (e.g. \\"Places that Scare You\\") and has a terrific video entitled, \\"Good Medicine.\\"	2005-01-30

It is based on 2 short \\"songs\\" by Naropa (\\"The View Concisely Put\\" and \\"A Summary of Mahamudra\\") but also includes: Thrangu Rinpoche's commentary, a legendary history of Naropa's training by Tilopa, and Q&As.  His approach is quite traditional, but his style is conversational and pragmatic.  He includes (p. 89-90): refutations/limitations of other approaches, a comparison of (pp. 119 & 128): Mahamudra vs. regular Shamatha, (p. 140-6), (p. 152): 5 wisdoms, the 6 paramitas, (pp. 166-7): \\"bringing joy & sadness onto the path,\\" etc.  He also includes several teaching stories such as: (p. 126): the master wrestler looking for his jewel (while he was wearing it) story and the (pp. 187-8): Milarepa teaching Paltabum story-with lots of analogies.  Reading it, it seemed to me that Mahamudra meant turning the eye on the \\"I\\".  The author gave a number of quotable statements:<br /><br />p. 71: \\"The fully manifested state of anger is what is called the hell reams, where one perceives everything as a battleground, a realm of murder and violence.\\"<br /><br />p. 79: \\"Tilopa said, `to request teaching after teaching is like drinking water from the ocean-the more you drink, the more thirsty you get.  You'll never end this craving.'\\"<br /><br />p. 89: \\"Without cutting the root of disturbing emotions, true liberation is a `Mission: Impossible.'\\"<br /><br />p. 103: \\"By shifting our attitude away from selfishness and aspiring to help others, disturbing emotions can be reduced.\\"<br /><br />p. 133: \\"the very essence of that which thinks is the Dharmakaya\\"<br /><br />p. 143: \\"The Buddha said, `Analyze my teachings as carefully as you would test gold before buying it...Don't accept my words without questioning.  You must discriminate and examine them for yourself.\\"<br /><br />p. 193: \\"To touch base with the practice itself, sometimes it is more helpful to have everything condensed into short, concise words.

Its author counts 16th Karmapa & Kalu Rinpoche as his source lamas (root gurus).  The book covers the traditional preliminaries and meditative practices very succinctly but also in a very readable and understandable form-using numerous contemporary analogies such as cars on a highway resembling thoughts (p. 72), airplanes, houses, and even a stuffed tiger (pp. 104-5).  He states that (p. 19) \\"The ego and its entourage are our true enemy...In this domain the true atomic bomb is meditation...The mind can only take a vacation through meditation.\\"  Further, (p. 38) \\"memory is like an imprint on our mind, able to actualize itself the day after.  The same principle controls karma.\\"  The author not only describes meditation exercises (e.g. p. 115) but provides solid meditation advice useful to Westerners: (p. 79 regarding meditation obstacles): \\"It seems that in Tibet and in the East in general, the tendency toward sleepiness dominates, while in the West agitation is the main problem,\\" (p. 82): \\"If one has a general tendency to be agitated, it is better to close the eyes.  If, on the other hand, one has a tendency to be sleepy, it is better to keep the eyes widely open,\\" & (p. 83): Generally, it is the fact that we have created in our past lives a karma that leads to sleepiness...However sleepiness can also come from a poor state of health, or from a great physical fatigue.\\"<br /><br />Bokar Rinpoche also includes a very interesting practice to integrate teachings into one's life: (pp. 61-2): \\"Fire symbolizes the fire of wisdom.  The movement of the wind reminds us of the transitory and changing nature of phenomena.  When thus perceived, appearances evoke a correspondence with the elements of our inner path, and they therefore function as a spiritual teacher...each time you see the sea or think about the sea, may it be for you the symbol of love and compassion.\\"  The book includes actual footnotes (not endnotes), photos of meditation postures, an index, and a glossary: (e.g. p. 146): \\"SUBTLE WINDS: Prana (Skt.).

The actual text is slightly over 16 pages in length and mostly addresses the 4 Yogas of Mahamudra.  He quotes Zasep Tulku rinpoche (p.2), \\"Mahamudra is nothing special.  It's just watching the mind.  It's not really some Tibetan thing or Indian thing.  It's not cultural, not religious.  Just watching the mind.\\"  My favorite quotes from the text itself are: (p. 17) \\"The Mahamudra is 'that which is without characteristics'\\" and (p. 20) \\"The obstacles of fixation on thought are clarified by knowing  the inseparability of mental events and the Dharmakaya.\\"  The text also quotes (pp. 19-20) Naropa's \\"The Transformation,\\" \\"Know all actions as the display of Knowing.  Without imagining, without deliberating, without analyzing, without meditating, without inspecting, just keep the mind in its natural state.\\"  The book is short but VERY succinct & pithy.

Not only does it provide some comparison and historical information concerning B&ouml;n Dzogchen vs. Buddhist (Nyingma) Dzogchen (similar to that of the erudite scholar Samten Karmay in his \\"The Great Perfection, a Philosophical and Meditative Teaching of Tibetan Buddhism\\"), but it provides direct translation of two entire B&ouml;n Dzogchen texts, ;\\"The Twelve Little Tantras\\" (which is very reminiscent of Nyingma Dzogchen) and \\"The View which is like the Lion's Roar\\" (which seems to have some differences, though mostly commonalities, with Buddhist Dzogchen).  It also contains considerable excerpts from \\"The Lamp that Clarifies the View.\\"  These are lovely works though rather concise and advanced-not for a beginner.  The book is actually much shorter than it appears because the 3 texts are given in both Tibetan and English and the two full texts are presented with one verse per page (with opposite pages in the different languages).  Thus most pages take up only about half a full page.  Still, it is not light reading, but worth contemplating at length.<br /><br />A few quotations will provide some feel for the nature of the text/translation:<br /><br />p. 45: from \\"The Lamp that Clarifies the View\\" a short Terma; \\"The Great Perfection abides (in) everything ... (it) has no duality of acceptance (and) rejection, good (or) bad...It exists spontaneously without birth and death ... (it is) without duality.<br /><br />p. 105: from \\"The Twelve Little Tantras\\" The Pure-and-Perfect Mind is without cause, (it) is not an effect produced by causes; (it) exists without effort, like the sky...

US	30672120	R1FDKVY1UBW4ID	096303717X	950824773	Opening the Door to Certainty	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Very concise summary of 9th Karmapa's "Ocean of Certainty"	Bokar Rinpoche has summarized the 9th Karmapa's largest Mahamudra book (of his trilogy). The two smaller books have been published with commentaries: \\"Pointing out the Dharmakaya\\" by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche and \\"Mahamudra: Eliminating the Darkness of Ignorance\\" translated by Alex Berzin with commentary by Beru Rinpoche. Bokar Rinpoche's book includes both English translation and Tibetan--so the number of English pages to read is quite small. There is no commentary. Thus, it is quite useful as a reference text (it's stated purpose) for those who have already studied the original text. Fortunately, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche has already published two books of commentary on this text: \\"The 9th Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive Meaning\\" and \\"An Ocean of Ultimate Meaning.\\" As far as I can determine, the original text is one of the most important Mahamudra texts in existence--rivalled only by \\"Moonbeams of Mahamudra\\" by Takpo Tashi Namgyal (published in English as \\"Mahamudra: The Quintessence of Mind and Meditation\\" by Lobsang P. Lhalungpa) which I have yet to read.	2005-01-24

She is a Western Tibetan Buddhist nun who studied with Trungpa Rinpoche.  She's published several lovely books (e.g. \\"Places that Scare You\\" and \\"Start Where You Are\\") as well as videos (e.g. \\"Good Medicine\\") and tape sets (e.g. \\"Noble Heart\\").  This particular item addresses her two main topics of the Lojong mind training and the practice of Tonglen (sending & receiving).  The many techniques, meditations, explanations, etc. are VERY useful in daily life even if you don't do regular, daily, spiritual practices.  Some Lojong items are: \\"Make friends with yourself,\\" finding the soft spot within (sometimes hard to do!), resistence to capacitence, \\"how to do your best when you feel your worst,\\" and \\"when you ask a question wholeheartedly, you begin to get the answer everywhere.\\"  Tonglen means taking in (mentally) other person's suffering and sending them your own happiness instead.  Not easy at first, but she provides ways to ease into it and, best of all, a terrific \\"on-the-spot\\" method which is FAR easier to employ.  This is simply a super set of tapes by a fantastic teacher.	2005-01-24

It also includes references to different Tibetan perspectives--the 8 practice lineages (i.e. \\"independent schools of Buddhism that flourished in Tibet: Nyingma, Kadampa, Marpa Kagy&uuml;, Shangpa, Kagy&uuml;, Sakya, Jordruk, Shije, and Ch&ouml;d\\" per p. 100) and types (pp. 47-9 Sarma and Nyingma).  It quotes from many other texts (e.g. pp. 49-50 Tantra & Union of Sun & Moon Tantra).  The author is succinct but quite understandable, despite the advanced nature of his text, and provides very pithy advice: pp. 56-7 \\"it is essential to trust that whatever appears, such as sounds, colors, and lights, the peaceful and wrathful deities, the bindus, light rays, light paths, and pure realms-all are nothing other than one's natural manifestation.\\"  His down-to-earth manner facilitates comprehension: p. 62 \\"Although sinful people may perceive the workmen of the Lord of Death, these are in fact nothing more than their own karmic experiences.  In reality, no matter what appears or how it appears, the crucial point is recognizing it to be nothing but personal experiences.\\"  He provides some surprising information: p. 70: the bardo of becoming (which sounds like a karma-based purgatory) where \\"one's innate god and demon separate one's acts of virtue and evil by dividing up white and black pebbles.\\"  His \\"Concluding Verses\\" on pp. 79-81 are somewhat similar to Geshe Dhargyey's \\"The Wheel of Sharp Weapons\\": \\"The death experience is only your own conceptual thinking.  Without constructing thoughts, abandon them in the space of self-cognizance.  This is the essential practice of the bardo of dying.  The fixation on appearance or disappearance, as being good or bad, is your mind.  This mind is the self-expression of Dharmakaya perceiving whatever there is.  Not to think, make concepts, accept, or reject what is perceived.  That is the essential practice of the bardo of dharmata.\\"  The Glossary is quite helpful: p. 97: \\"COEMERGENT IGNORANCE (lhan cig skyes pa'I ma rig pa)  `Co-emergent' means arising together with or coexistent with one's mind, like sandalwood and its fragrance.  `Ignorance' here means lack of knowledge of the nature of mind,\\" p. 111: LORD OF DEATH (gshin rje) A personification of impermanence and the unfailing law of cause and effect,\\" and p. 116: PERSONAL EXPERIENCE (rang snang) The example for this is the dream experience.

US	30672120	R19TCW5GRDA611	0882680501	538905253	Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness (English and Tibetan Edition)	Books	4	19	29	N	N	Fantastic Text with flawed commentary	This book is a commentary on the titled Terma text.  The text is terrific (worth 5 stars), reminiscent of Norbu's \\"The Supreme Source\\" or Longchenpa's \\"Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phenomena.\\"  While addressing Dzogchen's Trekch&ouml; view, it includes very interesting & refreshing statements.  It uses \\"empty\\" differently than other books & Mr. Reynolds commentary--not signifying dependent-arising (or interdependent) but actual emptiness (page 13, stanza 8): \\"Since it is empty and not created anywhere whatsoever, it is the Dharmakaya\\" and (page 14, stanza 10) \\"It is certain that the nature of the mind is empty and without any foundation whatsoever.  Your own mind is insubstantial like the empty sky...It is certain that self-originated primal awareness has been clear (and luminous) from the very beginning.\\"<br /><br />Per most Tibetan to English translations, it seems literal vs. figurative (i.e. concerned with an \\"accurate\\" translation rather than with reader understanding).  Mr. Reynolds states (page 115) \\"what is important at this primary level is to discover what the masters of the Dzogchen tradition actually say about their own tradition.\\"  I disagree.  The most important thing is for the reader to UNDERSTAND Dzogchen and be enabled to practice it.  For example, \\"nature of the mind\\" and \\"mind\\" are intermixed in a confusing manner.  The author's explanation of his choice (pages 47-8, stanza 6) is unconvincing vs. his alternative, \\"Mind Itself,\\" Padmasambhava's term \\"intrinsic awareness,\\" or the commonly used \\"ground of being.\\"  Per other texts, \\"meditate\\" is translated as meditate upon (transitive), so Mr. Reynolds uses \\"contemplate\\" in stanza 8.  That's fine, but in English \\"meditate\\" is a dual verb, it can be either transitive or intransitive (check your dictionary).  Indeed, Padmasambhava states (page 13, stanza 8) \\"you are meditating without finding anything there to meditate on\\" (inferring intransitive meditation).<br /><br />In his commentary, appendix, and notes, Mr. Reynolds provides concise and precise explications of standard Dzogchen, Vajrayana, and Buddhist doctrines-though scattered in location and more like Apologetic vs. explanation-largely to justify extensive criticism of Evans-Wentz' (E-W) prior translation, in \\"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation\\" with Jung's Introduction.  Some criticisms are well-founded.  Mr. Reynolds greatly details Evans-Wentz' life, Vedanta, & Theosophy.  He seems to take a Sensate view (Myers-Briggs Type \\"S\\": preference for details, low level of abstraction, past vs. future).  Strangely, several of Mr. Reynolds' criticisms appear to conflict with the Terma!  The text is VERY interesting in that (page 12, stanza 6) Padmasambhava provides many synonyms for intrinsic awareness such as--the Self, the Mind, Alaya, etc.  Yet, Mr. Reynolds criticizes E-W for using virtually the same terms.<br /><br />But, Mr. Reynolds rightly criticizes some E-W excesses (e.g. implying that Rigpa as \\"the dew drop slips into the Shining Sea\\", poetic but not entirely accurate) and claims E-W inserts Hindu, Vedanta, and Theosophist views into Dzogchen (ignoring the possible influences of Western mysticism).  But most Westerner readers must translate Eastern terms into understandable language-not just English, and analogy facilitates communication.  Any differences (e.g. between Cosmic Consciousness and Rigpa, page 103) would need explication, but differences among Brahman (Upanishads), ground of being (Dzogchen), and Ein Sof (Kabbalah) seem elusive.  IMHO, Mr. Reynolds overrates such differences due to his low level of abstraction viewpoint.  He writes as an historian, not a scientist.  He seems unable to comprehend that there are differing perspectives-like the colors coming from a prism or facets of a diamond (Vajra).  A true master can step out of his/her culture to see the pristine truth sans bias.  I'd recommend reading \\"Mind at Ease\\" a Mahamudra text by the English-speaking Tibetan Traleg Kyabgon.<br /><br />Mr. Reynolds points out several real errors in Jung's Introduction (e.g. the asserted lack of Buddhist critical psychology & philosophy--page 148, note 53), but his grasp of Jungian psychology is deficient: he misinterprets Jung's mapping of Buddhist deities/Samboghakaya onto the unconscious when Jung clearly refers to their peaceful/wrathful duality (e.g. Manjushri/Yamantaka) vs. Mr. Reynolds realm-gods.  Mr. Reynolds misunderstands active imagination and the difference between psychotherapy & individuation.  Contemporary Tibetan masters (e.g. Thrangu Rinpoche, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche) admit such deities can be/are mental.  Mr. Reynolds seems oblivious to the mythological, allegorical, symbolical, and sometimes anachronistic aspects of Tibetan Buddhism which are normal components of religions--Mt. Meru is not the center of 4 continents (page 106), whether the Buddha knew it or not (who knows?).  Also, Mr. Reynolds strongly objects to Jung's \\"a slavish initiation of Buddhist practices by Westerners is bound to be fruitless, if not dangerous\\" which seems self-evident to me.  What's oddest about this book is what's missing:<br /><br />-- the differences between Christian Bhakti Yoga (of devotion) vs. Dzogchen Jnana Yoga (of wisdom)<br /><br />--the connection between the \\"other shore\\" (pages 145-6, note 47) with the standard Buddhist simile of the Yanas as boats across the sea of Samsara, not to mention Jung's night-sea journey.<br /><br />--the differences between Gelugpa (to which Mr. Reynolds seems to refer) and Kagyu Mahamudra.<br /><br />--that the Buddha's era has been reevaluated into the 5th century BCE instead of the 6th or 7th<br /><br />--the similarities of some of E-W's statements to Vipashyana meditation<br /><br />--that E-W/Jung's use of \\"Alaya\\" could refer to Absolute Alaya (as in the Terma)-page 113.<br /><br />--that symbols are psychological in both East and West-page 146.<br /><br />--the openness of Vajrayana (e.g. the Lojong mind training a la Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's many books/tapes)<br /><br />--the Maitri and compassion at the heart of Mahayana Buddhism-including Dzogchen<br /><br />--the awesome mind-expanding view of Dzogchen vs. (page 113)-seeing the forest vs. the bark of a tree<br /><br />--the simple beauty of Mr. Reynolds prior (wonderful) book, \\"The Golden Letters\\"eg Kyabgon.<br /><br />Mr. Reynolds points out several real errors in Jung's Introduction (e.g. the asserted lack of Buddhist critical psychology & philosophy--page 148, note 53), but his grasp of Jungian psychology is deficient: he misinterprets Jung's mapping of Buddhist deities/Samboghakaya onto the unconscious when Jung clearly refers to their peaceful/wrathful duality (e.g. Manjushri/Yamantaka) vs. Mr. Reynolds realm-gods.

It includes drawings or color plates for the bulk of them as well as an introductory stanza on each.  The stories have much in common-generally showing how people in various walks of life can reach enlightenment.  There is some duplication, especially with most of them being taken into Dakini Land with a host of disciples and practicing a sadhana for 12 years (usually) enables them to reach enlightenment.  Woven into most of the stories are pearls of Mahamudra wisdom especially on how to turn obstacles into the Path.  Also, Mr. Dowman has a 20-page introduction that is a very lovely and concise summary of Mahamudra (the highest teaching of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism though he alludes to the Sakyas using it also).  He says (page 28) that \\"Mahamudra-siddhi is only accessible when such thought patterns have become dominated by a vision that no longer experiences reality as this or that, or a synthesis of this and that, or an absence of this or that.  Reality, in fact, is the excluded middle.\\"  Further, \\"The Tibetan tradition is characterized by an overwhelming unwillingness to question Indian doctrines and established values, and departures from the Tantra of the siddhas have been few and far between.\\"  [siddhis are psychic abilities]  He also states that there's no reason why there shouldn't be a Tantric blooming in the West.<br /><br />Pearls of Wisdom include (page 49): \\"Lilapa's story shows us that when the karmic leanings and aspirations of the disciple blend harmoniously with the teachings of the guru, there is no need to renounce the pleasures of this life in order to attain liberation.\\"<br /><br />Mahamudra stanzas include:  page 81: \\"To release water in the ear, Inject water into the ear.  To see truth, Contemplate all phenomena as a lie.\\"<br /><br />page 83: I mold the leather of preconception and conceptual thought around the last of emptiness and compassion.  Taking the awl of intuitive insight, I stitch with the thread of existence that knows no beginning and no end.

The practices include the shortest of the three main practices.  The other two are Sutra practices, but this one is a combination of Sutra and Tantra, so it is shorter.  Also included (pages 100-101) are two even shorter (extremely short in truth) practices for when one cannot perform the full practice.  In addition (pages 61-2), the author includes a specific, on-the-spot practice of Karma Chakme (author of the fabulous \\"Union of Mahamudra and Dzogchen\\" - see my list of that name) which reminds me of Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n's on-the-spot Tonglen practice.

You can visualize yourself as the Medicine Buddha if you wish, but the main focus is to actually visualize a small form of the Medicine Buddha, no larger than four finger-widths in height, in the actual part of your body that is afflicted.  So if it is an illness or pain in the head, visualize a small Medicine Buddha in the head; if it is in the hand, visualize a small Medicine Buddha in the hand...Visualize the Medicine Buddha in that place, and think that from this small but vivid form of the Medicine Buddha rays of light are emitted.  These rays of light are not simplylight, which is dry, but liquid light having a quality of ambrosia.  This luminous ambrosia or liquid light actually cleanses and removes the sickness and pain-whatever it is.  You can do this not only for yourself, by visualizing the Medicine Buddha in the appropriate part of your own body, but you can do it for others as well by visualizing the Medicine Buddha in the appropriate part of their body or bodies.  The radiation of rays of light of ambrosia and so on is the same.  This can be applied not only to physical sickness but to mental problems as well.  If you want to get rid of a particular type of anxiety or stress or depression or fear or any other kind of unpleasant mental experience, you can visualize the Medicine Buddha seated above the top of your head and think in the same way as before that luminous ambrosia or liquid light emerges from his body, filling your body and cleansing you of any problem, whatever it is.

Dzogchen is similar to the Mahamudra teachings of the Kagyu school, and the newest school (Gelugpa) of the Dalai Lama practices a version of Mahamudra as well.  You can see my lists of Dzogchen, Mahamudra, and Union of Mahamudra & Dzogchen for other books and tapes on these subjects.  Surya Das is an American Lama and best known for his Awakening the...books (especially Awakening the Buddha Within).  On one hand, he dispenses with much of the Tibetan-specific mythology and symbology which Westerners can find disturbing or confusing.  On the other hand, he tends to use humor a lot, coining such phrases as HahaYana (vs. Vajrayana).  But these phrases often contain wisdom too: \\"We're all seekers; we need to become finders\\" and \\"Lighten up as we enlighten up.\\"  The latter may seem strange to those familiar with other Tibetan Buddhist (Vajrayana) teachings, but is not unusual for Dzogchen.  Dzogchen gets to the heart of the mind without the elaborate visualizations of the generation and completion stages of the lower teachings.  In this tape, Lama Das covers many basic teachings (e.g. the six paramitas--ways to approach life) as well as more advanced Dzogchen-specific teachings/methods (e.g. sky gazing).  He does relate Dzogchen to regular Tantric Yogas (the lower 8 according to Nyingma).  He also attempts to relate the teachings to life in America, coining phrases as \\"household engineer,\\" America the Buddhafull,\\" and \\"knowing and glowing.\\"  I find his metaphor equating vipashyana (insight meditation) to vaccination quite intriguing.  In addition to actual teachings, he includes a number of guided meditations (which do take up a significant portion of the tape which is thus, blank--no talking) as well as the chanting of 3 mantras (Guru Rinpoche, Avalokiteshwara or Chenrezig, and Tara).  Regarding the latter, he references the \\"21 Praises of Tara\\" which is commented upon by Khenchen Palden Sherab in \\"The Smile of Sun and Moon\\" which I highly recommend.  All in all, this is a fine tape for someone interested in Dzogchen, especially if one doesn't have a Dzogchen Guru.  It provides an additional dimension (hearing).  I'd also recommend reading some of his books and some basic Dzogchen texts (e.g. Namkhai Norbu, Tulku Urgyen, or Drubwang Tsoknyi) before or immediately after listening to these tapes.he latter, he references the \\"21 Praises of Tara\\" which is commented upon by Khenchen Palden Sherab in \\"The Smile of Sun and Moon\\" which I highly recommend.

Vajrakilaya is a wrathful \\"Buddha\\" who dispels obstacles to Dharma practice.  His rites are used primarily in Nyingma and Sakya traditions (2 of the 4 contemporary Tibetan Buddhist schools).  Following the Introduction by Sogyal Rinpoche and photos of famous Rinpoches (e.g. Dudjom Rinpoche), it begins with a legendary history of Vajrakilaya which could be interpreted at a number of levels: symbolically, psychologically, traditionally, etc.  Chapter 3 delineates the actual practice.  This includes an interesting explanation (pages 45-8) of the Ground, Path, & Fruition of the practice--very reminiscent of Dzogchen and Mahamudra.  Further, the Path includes 4 aspects such as: wisdom awareness of Phurba (i.e. Vajrakilaya), enlightened mind Phurba (wisdom of completion stage), immeasurable compassion Phurba, and substantial Phurba (the actual ritual).  This explanation resembles a complete Vajrayana path including compassion, Bodhichitta, etc.!  Indeed, \\"The fruition Vajrakilaya is the primordial wisdom awareness of the mind of all the buddhas\\" (page 48).  The actual ritual (visualization/meditation) practice is then described in detail, similar in nature to \\"Machik's Complete Explanation...\\" by Sarah Harding (1559391820).  However, Khenpo Namdrol includes some astute explanations--especially in his analysis of Vajrakilaya's mantra--a word by word analysis in two versions (pages 68-9).  Finally, on page 71, he provides an explanation of why such rituals are ended in the traditional way--to prevent the extremes of nihilism and extremism.  All in all, this is a helpful book, much deeper than it might appear on the surface.	2005-01-12
US	30672120	R267T196LVIZAE	1880975076	569205665	The Smile of Sun and Moon	Books	5	27	27	N	Y	Just Lovely	While in Tibet, I noticed Thangkas (brocaded paintings used as wall hangings in Buddhist temples) with 21 Taras on them.  They differed from the ones with one large central figure (often of White or Green Tara).  Tara is the female Bodhisattva or Buddha of compassion and is VERY highly regarded in Tibet.  She is seen as radiating compassion without judgment--like the sun radiates its light on everyone.  The 21 Taras have many colors.  There is only 1 green Tara!  There are 5 White Taras, 7 red, 2 black, and various shades of gold.  The book includes a full color print (one per page) of each of the 21 in one section--probably the reason for the cost of the book.  Each Tara is in an identical pose, but the aura around them differs and (more particularly) the pistils of the Utpala (lotus) flower differ completely (i.e. each is unique to its Tara).<br /><br />The author of this book is, I believe, the co-author of the valuable \\"Lion's Gaze.\\" He begins with a translation of the entire \\"Praise to the 21 Taras.\\" Each of its 4 line stanzas addresses a different Tara.  After a fairly extensive Introduction, the body of the book is devoted to a chapter on each Tara including: a line drawing of the Tara with her name and characteristic phrase, her 4-line stanza from the \\"Praise,\\" then the 4 levels of meaning with phrases from the stanza in bold.  They are: literal, general (generation stage), hidden (completion stage with attributes), and ultimate (completion stage without attributes).  The literal is a commentary on the stanza; the general is a description of the figure of the Tara (line drawing or color plate) with explanations of the figure; the hidden is an explanation in terms of channels, bindus, etc.; and the ultimate is a Dzogchen (Great Perfection) or Mahamudra (Great Seal) analysis.  Each Tara's individual mantra is then provided.  The translations are simultaneous in Tibetan and English.<br /><br />So, if any of these 4 levels speaks to you, this book is a treasure--especially with its wonderful color plates.  It's the only book I know of in English that addresses this illuminating aspect of Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism).  Also, the only one that provides four simultaneous analyses from four levels or perspectives within the traditions, making it a sort of Tibetan Rosetta Stone for Westerners.  This is reminiscent of Kabbalists view of Pardes (the Garden) an acronym for four levels of interpretation of the Torah.

It must be pointed out that IMS is not a disease; it's a set of symptoms.  There's a big difference.  It's a bit like homelessness in that regard.  Many diseases and problems present the same symptoms (watch \\"House\\" or \\"ER\\" or \\"Medical Investigation\\" sometime on TV).  Thus, A Solution may either not exist (if there are many different causes (simultaneous or not) or may be hard to find.  In this case, as with homelessness, the causes are many.  The solutions, therefore, will vary depending upon the causes - not the symptoms.  Significantly, Mr. Diamond includes chapters addressing many factors (causes) that create the IMS.  He also presents \\"treatments\\" for those individual factors (e.g. the valuable Thought Record on page 217). This is excellent.  He also provides considerable references in each chapter.<br /><br />However, I think that he's overlooked a few things.  Firstly, while he has Alice Miller as a reference, he doesn't include her theory of non-genetic inheritance in which learned behaviors are passed down over generations through children emulating parents when they become parents themselves (see \\"The Drama of the Gifted Child\\").  This, I believe, is a very significant factor in the IMS.  Secondly, he does not include any Jungian typology in explaining human differences.  For example, his intriguing analysis of the Beatles vs. the Rolling Stones seems to me a difference between E (extroverted behavior) vs. I (introverted).  Indeed, the entire Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) may be a factor in IMS-especially considering the differences between spouses.  Which leads into the questions: \\"what about those who do NOT develop IMS?\\" & \\"Why not?\\"  It's hard to believe you could really understand IMS without understanding its opposite or control.<br /><br />Furthermore, some of the factors seem a bit far-fetched.  After taking a course on experimental design (a psychology course at George Washington University in DC), I am quite skeptical about scientific articles and research.  We reviewed a great many technical, peer-reviewed journals-and found that a large proportion were invalid.  Not necessarily wrong-invalid means that the conclusions were not fully justified by the study.<br /><br />Finally, since Mr. Diamond includes spirituality (which I admire him for doing), he might consider the development of egolessness a la Tibetan Buddhism.  It seems to me that (not withstanding the chemical factors) that ego has a lot to do with IMS.  I would suspect that IMS results from a combination of factors depending upon the susceptibility of the people involved and the interrelationship of their psychological propensities.  I do think that Mr. Diamond's advice regarding male initiation and male groups has a great deal of potential to depotentiate IMS.of the factors seem a bit far-fetched.

He has studied extensively in the West.  He says in his introduction that he is attempting to keep the book simple and accessible.  He succeeds, IMHO.  As he says on page 225, \\"in approaching the spiritual path, we need some understanding of what the journey involves.\\"  This deep book is incredibly easy to read and understand, despite its stated lack of personal experiences.  Unlike many others, the author includes the reasons behind the practices, the whys and wherefores as well as the how.  He also includes many, many exercises/meditations with very fine descriptions of the practices.  He also defines terms amazingly well-shining light on them with great clarity.  His Glossary is wonderfully written.  I especially liked his definition of \\"Interested Humility\\" (page 242) vs. \\"devotion.\\"  Within the text, he beautifully defines and describes such important experiences as Bliss, Clarity, and Mental Spaciousness (page 199) as well as delineating important distinctions such as meditative experiences and realizations (page 198).  The only point I still have a problem with (despite his quoting the Dalai Lama on page 125) is the difference between soul and Buddha nature.  It seems to me that they are addressing the Hindu atman which is not necessarily the idea in the West.  For example, Jung's archetype of the Anima or Animus differs from the atman.  It would be interesting to hear a Mahamudra analysis of such Jungian ideas.<br /><br />Additionally, the author introduces some new terminology which is helpful to the student's understanding.  For example, \\"conceptual overlays\\" (page 195) and mystical Mahayana (Mahamudra, Dzogchen, and some Zen sects on page 137); also he explains the relationships among memory, mindfulness, and being in the now (page 146).  Throughout the book is practical.  It even includes suggestions for using a zafu (small round cushion for the buttocks) on top of a zabuton (larger square cushion to help the ankles) on page 144.  Furthermore, he provides a fine description of the use of the Four Immeasurables (pages 92-117) as an prelude to the main Mahamudra meditation and refers to the applicability of them and Lojong (mind training: see Pema Chodron's \\"Start Where You Are\\" for particulars on this and \\"Noble Heart\\" for another view of the Four Immeasurables) for the Mahamudra practitioner (page 218).  I don't think I've heard that anywhere before either in Lojong books/tapes or Mahamudra & Dzogchen ones.  Nevertheless, as the author explains on page 202, insight does not come from purely from learning.<br /><br />The author's explanation of the value of differing perspectives is well worth quoting at length:<br /><br />\\"In Buddhism, it is openly conceded that having different terminologies and different concepts gives us a different understanding of something.  Multiple perspectives are valued because particular perspectives will necessarily yield corresponding understandings.  Sometimes people become annoyed by these multiple perspectives and begin to question which one is real and which ones are false.  The Buddhist position is that they are all true within their given context. They are also necessary because in Mahayana Buddhism the teachings have to accommodate the needs of a diverse range of people, all potential beneficiaries of the Dharma. Any single perspective that is dogmatically thrust upon a multitude of diverse individuals will fail to inspire many and is unlikely to benefit more than a few.  [however] Different perspectives have to form a coherent whole with an underlying thematic link between the variations, otherwise they would cease to be perspectives on the same thing\\" (page 136).<br /><br />Finally, the appendix (pages 229-35), \\"Precious Sun\\" Padma Karpo's Spiritual Advice is poetic, insightful, profound, and enlightening.on top of a zabuton (larger square cushion to help the ankles) on page 144.

US	30672120	R2KIQVTDKIWQXR	0374524955	4016252	Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity: Essays	Books	3	16	25	N	N	Beautiful words, but not too consistent IMHO	This book is a collection of essays, articles, interviews, etc. collected posthumously by Heschel's daughter.  I think she did a nice job of arranging the chapters.  Heschel is very emotive, expressionistic, politically liberal, religious (seems more Orthodox in practice than Conservative though he taught at the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary), and poetic.  His writings include many beautiful turns of phrase and quotable quotes (e.g. page 263: \\"Our grasp of the depth of suffering is comparable to the scope of the perception of a butterfly flying over the Grand Canyon\\").  Of the 3 of his books I've read (the other 2 are \\"The Sabbath\\" & \\"God in Search of Man\\"), I liked this one best.  It is, however, huge and not (at least for me) easy reading despite its limited philosophy content.  Unfortunately, my reaction to him isn't very positive, perhaps because he seems to preach so much and speaks in too authoritative a manner.  For example, he says again and again, Jews believe or do this or that and Americans do this or that.  People are simply not that consistent or similar.  Perhaps he's just following his expression on page 4: \\"A noble person does not compare himself with anybody else.\\"  But, people are almost invariably Normally Distributed.  And, Heschel is hardly at the mean/average.  I take a moderate stance, and his extremism annoys me.  If you take his perspective, I'd think you'd love this book.  But, Heschel doesn't speak for me.  True, he does wish to balance Halachah (religious law a la the Shulchan Arukh) with Agada (wisdom stories etc. - everything not the law).  Further, his background in Eastern European Hasidism ( his family traces back to the Great Maggid of Mezerich) explains much of his point of view.  He is quite critical in these essays.  I agree with his statement: (page 4) that \\"Man is creative only when he is neither apologetic nor propagandistic.\\"  But this should apply to Heschel too.  He seems propagandistic to me.  Furthermore, he continues on page 4, \\"Yet the strength of truth lies not in refuting others but in understanding itself, in being consistent with itself.\\"  I think he needs to follow his own valuable advice-& per page 20: \\"A human being must be valued by how many times he was able to see the world from a new perspective\\" and page 126: \\"We must not continue to cherish a theory just because we embraced it forty years ago.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, Heschel has a sense of humor and irony: (page 7): \\"If a man is not more than human, then he is less than human,\\" (page 20): \\"Most people think only once in their lives, usually when they are at college,\\" and (page 164): \\"All concepts are but glittering motes in a sunbeam.\\"  He also displays considerable insight into religion: (page 126): \\"Faith is not something we acquire once and for all.  Faith is an insight that must be acquired at every single moment,\\" (page 243): \\"Religion is a means, not an end.  It becomes idolatrous when regarded as an end in itself...to equate religion and God is idolatry,\\" (page 245): \\"The Torah as given to Moses, an ancient rabbi maintains, is but an unripened fruit of the heavenly tree of wisdom.\\"<br /><br />And yet, he doesn't seem to me to have been able to balance his feelings with his intellect.  He states on page 317 that \\"Man's task is to reconcile liberty with service, reason with faith\\" and \\"Man has to understand in order to believe, to know in order to accept.\\"  But his works don't seem to reflect this very much IMHO.  Finally, he decries the following (page 408): \\"One of the most popular definitions of God common in America today was developed by a great Protestant theologian: God is the Ground of Being.  So everybody is ready to accept it.\\"  Heschel finds this appalling.  Interestingly, The \\"Ground of Being\\" is a Dzogchen/Mahamudra (highest forms of Nyingma and Kagyu forms of Tibetan Buddhism) term.  I identify it with the Kabbalistic Ein Sof (which Heschel speaks of occasionally since the Hasids study/practice Kabbalah).  Maybe I'm dense, but I don't see much (if any) difference between what I believe to be the highest or ultimate conceptions of the All in Judaism (Kabbalah), Buddhism (Vajrayana), and Hinduism (the Brahman of the Upanishads).  Seems like an ultimate vision is an ultimate vision.  But, Heschel doesn't see it that way.  Too bad.sids study/practice Kabbalah).

He seems to me to be very emotional regarding his opinions and beliefs.  He came from an Eastern European Hasidic family whose ancestor was the Great Maggid of Mezerich.  He was a leader in the Civil Rights movement as well as the Vietnam anti-war movement.  He was on the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary, JTS, (of the Jewish Conservative movement).  This is rather humorous, I think, since he was obviously quite the idealistic Liberal.  He had a reputation as a mystic, causing him conflict with other JTS professors.  He was a very forceful personality.  IMHO he was very much a literary expressionist--putting his feelings into writing.  He was also quite poetic--his books include many clever and beautiful turns of phrase.  However, much of what he writes comes off as if they are sermons, as if he KNOWS.  I respect his views, but don't often agree with them.  This book doesn't read like philosophy to me (you can read \\"Between Kant and Kabbalah\\" by Mittleman on the Jewish philosopher Breuer, for example).  As a scientist, I object to anyone dismissing the contributions of science in virtually any arena.  Certainly psychology is a player in anything involving humans.  As a mystic, I certainly agree that the Divine is ineffable.  But people translate their contact with the Divine into human terms--mostly reflecting their individual propensities, biases, views, etc.  That secondary process is psychological/scientific.  Indeed, such communications have been compared to radio and television with a transmitter and receivers.  Furthermore, research into ESP (Dr. Rhine etc.) shows considerable applicability in understanding the processes involved in communicating with higher powers (e.g. God).  In addition, Heschel insists that the Bible be understood in terms of Biblical people.  Certainly, such an approach can provide an historical or hagiographical context for the causes that produced beliefs and documents (e.g. The Torah).  But, it is essentially irrelevant to today's individuals attempting to apply such beliefs and documents into their lives.  It is obvious that praying, studying Torah, putting on Tefillin, etc. excites and completes Heschel, but that doesn't mean they do for everyone--and certainly not identically.  He makes the common human mistake of assuming everyone is like him (or should be).  I humbly disagree.  Nevertheless, he did provide a differing point of view to be considered as well as a couple of good quotes for my collection.:<br /><br />p. 317: When superimposed as a yoke, as a dogma, as a fear, religion tends to violate rather than to nurture the spirit of man.  Religion must be an altar upon which the fire of the soul may be kindled by holiness.<br /><br />p. 361: Every act done in agreement with the will of God is a mitzvah.<br /><br />Mostly, however, I have to say (though I'm sure it will upset some people) that I found this particular book very boring.

US	30672120	RWDEZH7152N9L	0791402398	867893481	Between Kant and Kabbalah: An Introduction to Isaac Breuer's Philosophy of Judaism (SUNY Series in Judaica: Hermeneutics, Mysticism, and Religion)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Hard to rate--Jewish Orthodoxy vs. Science, reason, etc.	This is a difficult book for the layman to read.  It's written in an academic style and its' contents are philosophy and Orthodox Judaism including difficult concepts and arguments.  I think the author did a very creditable job analyzing Breuer (as far as I can tell).  He analyzes the influences and effects of Kant, Schopenhauer, Kabbalah, and others on Breuer and his works as well as to compare/contrast Breuer's works themselves as a development over time of his point of view and philosophy.  In the last chapter, the author provides his own view of Breuer--both the plusses and minuses.  I must agree with Oskar Wolfsberg's criticism (cited on page 84) that \\"Breuer evaded a genuine confrontation between science and Torah, that Breuer's system is thoroughly deductive, descending from dogmatic presuppositions and avoiding a scientific, presumably inductive method; tha Breuer's conclusuions sound too much like his premises, and that Breuer proceeds 'with the arrogance of the dogmatician' who knows everhtin in advance without a shred of evidence.\\"  But, I would extend this criticism to the entire book (sans the last chapter).  I cannot say whether Mittleman's analysis of Kant is correct, but as a scientist, I certainly take issue with Breuer's view of science.  I would go farther, since Breuer's philosophy addresses the \\"I,\\" to say that he ignores psychology.  Kind of astounding, really, especially when Jung and Freud were practically contemporaries of his.  I agree with Mittleman that Breuer's usage of Kabbalah was only at the edges--he used it only for his own means--bending it to his will as he did Kant.  Not that there's anything wrong with such syncretism in developing one's own philosophy.  However, I strongly object to Breuer's turning the word \\"freedom\\" on its head.  Essentially he transposes \\"freedom\\" for \\"slavery\\" (to the past) and \\"slavery\\" to \\"freedom\\" in the present (e.g. modern Democratic and Republican forms of government).  Mittleman points out Breuer's rejection of personal freedom, but doesn't go far enough IMHO.  I also object to the author's continued use of German (and other languages) vs. translating them into English (except for Breuer's neologisms).

This is somewhat analogous to Breuer who was caught between two worlds--modernity and the Orthodoxy with which he was brought up.

His seems to me to be an act of desperation, an attempt against the impossible to reconcile the irreconcilable.  His genius was that he accomplished what he did and serves as a remarkable example of a genius unwilling to step off the diving board into an unforeseen future--despite the fact that he was a major force in Orthodoxy attempting to establish their involvement in contemporary politics (e.g. the creation of Israel).

Essentially it is a book of quotations taken from Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's other works.  Since I've read \\"Rainbow Painting\\" (my favorite one) and \\"As It Is\\" volumes I & II, though not \\"Repeating the Words of the Buddha,\\" it seemed a bit redundant to me at first.  But when viewed as a reference work, its value becomes apparent.  It would be difficult for a reader to understand many of the entries in this book without a considerable background in Dzogchen (or at least Vajrayana) prior to reading it.  On the other hand, one way to learn an esoteric subject is to immerse oneself in it-reading everything one can get one's hands on - and allowing what was read to coalesce in one's (unconscious as well as conscious) mind.  Certainly, Urgyen Rinpoche was a great contemporary Dzogchen master.  So there is much to like about his teachings, and this book is a great condensation of those.  It could serve as an introduction to his larger works-inspiring readers to investigate the teachings more deeply.  There are many things to learn: objects are merely appearances (p. 69), \\"Obstructing forces are one's own thoughts arising externally; they are also called harmful spirits.  They are the forces that pull one back from attaining the state of enlightenment and they originate from one's own thoughts, from ignorance\\" (p. 105), The only way to acquire all the great qualities of enlightenment is to repeat many times the short moment of recognizing mind essence...by practicing many times, we get used to it (p. 126), you need to be able to dissolve dualistic mind in nondual awareness (p. 141), the training in recognizing mind essence is this: short moments repeated many times (p. 172), In Dzogchen, the ultimate view is to relax into nondual awareness (p. 180).  Perhaps best of all are his specific quotes on Trekch&ouml; and T&ouml;gal on pages 140-1 and page 174 and on the View on page 180-2.  Indeed, the more extensive entries (alphabetically listed titles) allow one to view what the author said on a particular subject at different times in different books.  This throws considerable light on such subjects-when one can see them from several angles at once.one to view what the author said on a particular subject at different times in different books.

I liked volume I (and \\"Rainbow Painting\\") better.  But, it's certainly worth your time reading it.  The title of this book reflects its main tenet (p. 97 \\"nothing needs to be accepted or rejected; it is already perfect \\"as it is.\\" i.e. the title of book).  It's also taken from a quotation (pp. 140-1) from Padmasambhava's \\"Lamrim Yeshe Nyingpa\\" -<br /><br /> \\"Empty cognizance of one taste, suffused with knowing,<br /><br /> Is your unmistaken nature, the uncontrived original state.<br /><br /> When not altering what is, allow it to be as it is,<br /><br /> And the awakened state is right now spontaneously present.<br /><br />`As it is here means actuality.  `Actuality' means seeing directly how it is, not as an idea or a concept.  This matches the philosophical (and Rosicrucian) use of Actuality for \\"what is\\" vs. Reality for our perceptions of \\"what is.\\"<br /><br /> Interestingly, the title of the publishing company similarly reflects the writings of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: (e. g. on p. 94) Rangjung Yeshe = \\"self-existing wakefulness.\\" This is reminiscent of Tulku Urgyen's son Drubwang Tsoknyi's book \\"Present Fresh Wakefulness.\\"<br /><br /> This view is similarly described in Kagyu Mahamudra, Madhyamaka (The Middle Way philosophy), and Nyingma Dzogchen.  The author describes these similarities in several places in the book (e. g. pp. 97, 122 &. 233).  He also includes quotations from the three traditions throughout the book (e. g. pp. 117-8, 207, etc.) and even some stories on Ch&ouml; (d) on pp. 222-3.<br /><br /> However, the first half dozen chapters are considerably redundant with volume I as well as with each other.  Repetition may be beneficial in order for the reader/practitioner to absorb the view at a deeper than intellectual level.  Chapter 7 (pp. 127-143, \\"The Highway of the Victorious Ones\\") is very different from the rest of the book-it's my favorite chapter!  In it, the author includes a concise yet enlightening description of Trekch&ouml; and T&ouml;gal (the 2 main Dzogchen practices) on pages 136-7.  He has a poetic way of pithy description of the essence of the teachings (somewhat like a koan), such as on pp. 141-2:<br /><br /> \\"See the view of no viewing.<br /><br /> Train in the meditation with nothing meditated upon.<br /><br /> Carry out the conduct of nondoing.<br /><br /> Achieve the fruition in which there is no thing attained.\\"<br /><br />On the down side, it is difficult to tell if he is using mythological beliefs just for illustration or not.  For example, on p. 117 he uses the example of insects born only from heat and moisture and describes the physical activities of obstructing gods on p. 221.  On the other hand, he clears up the question of life after death logically: (p. 225): \\"mind is not some `thing' that can die.  The reason why there can be a succession of lives is because of this mind.  If mind could die, there would be no rebirth\\" and (p. 228): \\"In actuality, death is only the death of the body; mind does not die.\\"<br /><br /> He also provided some interesting quotes for my collection:<br /><br />p. 118 \\"It is not all right to let simplicity be fettered by complexity.\\"<br /><br />p. 149 \\"a thought is simply the extroverted expression of knowing, of awareness.\\"<br /><br />p. 234 Tibetan Proverb: \\"The wise may still find truth in the words of a rascal\\" which is quite similar to the Western Proverb: The wise can learn even from a fool, but a fool cannot learn even from the wise.

One of the most prolific writers on the subject is Namkhai Norbu (I've read 9 of his books).  His books are very readable and include important descriptions, insights, etc.  They serve as, perhaps, the best introductory books (except for the wonderful \\"Supreme Source\\" which is more advanced).

It explains 3 levels of practice with the most famous, the offering of one's body to the demons, as the lowest level and Mahamudra approach as the highest.  It provides the context for understanding (i.e. knowledge vs. mere information).  It also describes the many varied sources used in this study.  Lineages are described in both words and diagrams.  It includes not only historical/biographical data but also the hagiographical/miraculous/mythical tradition.  The latter is expertly explained via pithy, concise endnotes.  Most importantly are the explanations of the relationships among Ch&ouml;d, Mahamudra, and the Perfection of Wisdom (Prajnaparamita Sutras of various lengths--see Conze's translations--including the Heart Sutra).  Perhaps the most key concept is the definition of demon (there's an interesting analysis of 4 types provided by Machig).  Some great illustrative quotes:<br /><br />p. 67-9: quoting Machig: `The origin of all demons is in the mind itself.  When awareness holds on and embraces any outer object, it is in the hold of a demon.  Likewise, mind is stained when a [mental image] is wrongly taken to be a real object.  In this way, all outer and inner objects grasped by mind as if they were real which thereby generate desire, aversion, or arrogance, should be viewed as demons because they prevent the realization of the clear light emptiness nature of mind, Mahamudra...Since mistaken grasping to reality comes from material objects, I have explained this as tangible demons...The intangible demons...are the positive or negative thoughts that arise in the mind...the intangible demons ...are the emotions such as suffering and so forth...they all derive from arrogance, the faulty grasping onto a self.  They are the demons of mistaken attachment to reality.'<br /><br />pp. 73-4: quoting Machig: `whatever miraculous displays of gods and demons appear, recognize them as the miraculous display of your own mind.'<br /><br />p. 76: quoting Machig: `Attachment to any phenomenon whatsoever, from coarse form to omniscience, should be understood as the play of a demon.'<br /><br />pp. 76-7: The main function of Ch&ouml;d: to serve as a link between the highest metaphysical vision and the popular religion.<br /><br />I'd also recomment Tsultrim Allione's cassette entitled: \\"Feeding the Demons: Relaxing Dualism.\\"  You can also read Lama Zopa's pamplet on Ch&ouml;d for a description of the practice.

The longest one, the Ocean of Definitive Meaning (or Ultimate Meaning) was published with commentary by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche twice (\\"The Ninth Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive Meaning\\" and \\"An Ocean of Ultimate Meaning\\").  Likewise, Thrangu Rinpoche published his commentary of \\"Pointing Out the Dharmakaya.\\"  The present work is one of the shortest (maybe the shortest) of the 3 texts by the 9th Karmapa (1556-1603).  It is, thus, quite concise--reminiscent of \\"The Practice of Mahamudra\\" by Chetsang Rinpoche in that regard.  Beru Rinpoche's commentary (paragraph by paragraph) is also quite concise, but virtually always contributes greatly to the reader's understanding of the text and of Mahamudra.  The translation by Alexander Berzin seems first rate to me.  I'd give the main book 4.5 stars.  However, in addition to this text, the book also includes the 1st century BCE text \\"Fifty Stanzas of Guru-Devotion\\" by Aryasura (or Asvaghosa) with commentary by Geshe Ngawang Dhargyey who is presumably the co-author of the very fine modern classic, \\"Advice from a Spiritual Friend.\\"  It was writtn during the reign of Kanishka of the Kushan dynasty--known for his ancient coinage.  It includes much detail about how to choose and treat one's Guru.  However, its context must be considered.  For example, it is considered unseemly to point your feet (still the case in Asia) and to step on your Guru's shadow.  Some of the items could be considered either Tibetan-specific beliefs or culture or even superstition, but considering the age of the text, these should be overlooked by the Western reader.  There is some practical advice still useful today.	2004-12-29

His books tend to be rather short though and are very readable.  He is one of the contemporary masters of Dzogchen, the highest teaching in the Nyingma (old translation) tradition of Tibet.  This is one of the 4 main contemporary schools of Tibetan Buddhism.  He also has a magazine called \\"The Mirror\\" that you can subscribe to and gives seminars/teachings around the country (see the Snow Lion Bulletin for announcements).  This particular book takes the teachings through a typical day (thus, the title).  Dzogchen includes the view that all that we see, hear, etc. is empty of independent being (like the reflection of the moon in a lake).  While this is also part of the Prajnaparamita works on Mahayana Buddhism as well (see Conde's translations), Dzogchen takes it farther into the View of the Ground of Being or Dharmakaya and its practice of Trekcho as well as the maintenance, during post-meditation, of spontaneous presence.  It is quite profound.  Enjoy this book, but read his others as well since this book is not completely comprehensive.	2004-12-29

This is reminiscent of the Hasidic tale about the Zaddik who got to accompany the prophet Elijah as long as he didn't ask why Elijah did what he did.  Elijah did things that were inexplicable to the Zaddik until he finally broke down and asked Elijah why he killed the cow of the poor but gracious couple, fixed the miser's wall, etc.  Each time the explanation was logical, but included knowledge unkown to the Zaddik (e.g. the crumbling wall held a treasure that the miser would have discovered had Elijah not fixed the wall).  This work is perhaps the best of the 3 books (the other two are: \\"The Initiate in the New World\\" and \\"The Initiate in the Dark Cycle\\").  But, they are all very good and quite enlightening in both a psychological and spiritual sense.  They are not religious in orientation.  There are also some great quotes in this book that I have placed into my collection:<br /><br />All sins...are nothing but a searching for happiness in the wrong direction, and all sinners are but children who will eventually grow up.  Tolerance is the recognition of this fact.  pp. 77-8<br /><br />Real love forgives its object always--even before there would seem something to forgive--and all true friends love each other better, the one for having some fault to pardon, and the other for being pardoned respecting that fault.  p.107<br /><br />A thing is tedious or pleasant according to what one brings to it oneself.  p.211<br /><br />Ignorance can never convince knowledge.  Annie Besant, quoted on p.213<br /><br />Nothing in itself contains Beauty or Happiness, but only serves to draw out a particle of that infinite Beauty and Happiness latent in the mind, or better said in the soul.  pp. 268-9<br /><br />He who thinks least of his own character benefits it the most.  p.311  NOTE: the pages may be off due to differing editions.t infinite Beauty and Happiness latent in the mind, or better said in the soul.  pp. 268-9  <br /> <br />He who thinks least of his own character benefits it the most.  p.311   NOTE: the pages may be off due to differing editions.	2004-12-28

Kushner has a great deal of sensitivity and creativity in his representations.  He has also written \\"Honey from a Rock\\" which I have yet to read.  There are several fine quotes in the book that I've added to my collection:<br /><br />p. 18 Disgust and dread are the sorts of feelings we frequently marshal to conceal deeper layers of our psyche.  \\"If an element appearing in a myth or in a dream belongs to a much earlier phase of development and is not part of the conscious frame of reference at the time of the final formation of the myth, this element often carries with it the quality of dread and awfulness.\\"  Quoting Erich Fromm<br /><br />p. 108 Humanity, one might say, is the organ of consciousness in the universe.  We are the result of consciousness's desire to become aware of itself.  As Jung observed, \\"If the Creator were conscious of himself, he wouldn't have needed us.\\"  Being speaks of and listens to itself through humanity... Of course, there is no consciousness in the universe without humanity.  Humanity is the organ of consciousness in the universe and for this reason we hold our Creator hostage; without our eyes the Holy One of Being would be blind.  Insensate.	2004-12-28

Knowledge differs from Information in that it includes context.  Do you rate a book in accordance with the context (e.g. time period in history) in which it was written?  Or do you look at it from your own, present perspective?  I'd do both.  This book was, no doubt, an audacious breakthrough when it was published.  It involved considerable work and thought.  It is still THE definitive work on the subject--which says a lot.  A few decades ago, I migh have given it 5 stars.  But times change and people (hopefully) grow and mature.  This book has quite a bit of breadth (though it tends to emphasize men vs. women, and West vs. East) but many of the thumbnail descriptions aren't too deep.  This is part of the author's problem since descriptions of CC experiences tend to be short and far less than scientific.  The whole book consists of these vignettes of various person's CC experiences (as decided by Bucke).  Since it's not statistical, it is difficult to seriously accept Bucke's hypothesis that CC experiences are markedly increasing over time--though intuitively it is quite satisfying to do so.  His parallel argument for the development of color in human seeing is fascinating.  It needs a more scientific analysis though.  But, he has opened an interesting field of study.  Unfortunately, he also includes his own prejudices (rating Whitman as incredibly great, including few women in the book, and displaying ocnsiderable racial/color prejudice).  The latter may, however, merely reflect the nature of his non-scientific study since records of African CC experiences were indubitably unavailable to him (and probably unavailable to us today).  But that does NOT mean they didn't happen.  Relying only on published material in the world of mystical experience is treading on thin ice.  Further, descriptions of CC experiences are difficult since the experiences themselves are numinous and hard to define/describe.  Nonetheless, Bucke has done us a great service in opening this topic to serious study (somewhat parallel to Gershom Scholem and Kabbalah).  He's done more than others, per one of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\"Once a week the road-sweeper came by with his brush.  He was a friendly old fellow; and Miss Gidding at the Hollies, got into the habit all that summer of taking him a glass of lemonade and a slice of cake.  He thanked her shyly, and that was all.  But one evening there came a knock at the back door of the Hollies.  The road-sweeper was there, a cauliflower in one hand and a bunch of sweet peas in the other.  He seemed embarrassed as he said, \\"I've brought you these, ma'am, for your kindness.\\" \\"Oh, you shouldn't,\\" exclaimed Miss Gidding, 'It was nothing.'

Many other Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhist) books refer to or even provide some explanation of the Vajrayana psychic system (which seems to me to parallel the Hindu Raja Yoga approach).  But, in his usual thorough manner, the author provides a very organized and detailed description herein.  I attended one of his weekend gatherings and was impressed with him, though I've heard he's had some falling out with other Vajrayana lamas.  His New Kadampa school is, I believe, a follow-up to the now defunct Kadampa school of Tibet which, I believe, the present Gelugpas (headed by the Dalai Lama) evolved from.  It seems to me that the Gelugpa \\"Mahamudra\\" is VERY different from the Kagyu Mahamudra.  The latter is quite similar in many respects to the Nyingmapa Dzogchen.  The four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism are: Nyingmapa (the oldest based on 9th century translations), the Kagyu and Sakya (evolved about the same time), and the Gelugpa (the newest, I believe).  Though the relatively recent Rime ecumenical movement attempted (pretty successfully) to provide cross-over teachings across the four schools.  In any case, this book, while certainly not easy reading, provides a great source of information on esoteric, hard-to-find Vajrayana principles.	2004-12-23

More importantly, he explains the purpose of several Tibetan Buddhist (Vajrayana) techniques which are otherwise alien to a Western mind.  The many deities map onto Jungian Archetypes for example.  Furthermore, he meticulously describes the technique of Dzogchen Trekcho and relates it to both the development and completion stage practices of Vajrayana.  He also speaks to Yidam practice and one vs. a multiplicity of Yidams or deities.  Thus, he eliminates many of the obstacles to Western understanding of Tibetan beliefs and practices.  This book is well worth reading for students and practitioners of Dzogchen, Mahamudra (referenced a number of times herein), and Vajrayana.  I look forward to reading [[ASIN:9627341398 As It Is, Vol. 2]].	2004-12-23

As a student of Dzogchen, I see tons of parallels with the author's Zen approach.  Even better, as a scientist, I greatly enjoyed his use of modern scientific views as parallels to Buddhist thought and theory.  Of course, both Mindfulness and Insight Meditation are used in virtually all types of Buddhism including Theravada (Southeast Asian or Southern Buddhism) and Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism--a type of Northern or \\"Mahayana\\").  There are many currently available Tibetan books on these two which have far more details and more pithy descriptions IMHO.  Even Dzogchen and Mahamudra books describe them and promote their continued usage.  Still, this is a good book with some different information (less duplication than some of TNH's other works).  It has quite a good deal of useful information in its few pages.  I gave a copy as a gift to a friend.  This one is worth the read.	2004-12-23

Yes, TNH seems very sincere and authentic, but he's also very hard over left wing (I prefer a more balanced approach to life), simplistic, Eastern (see the works of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, for example, to see how an Eastern master can adapt ancient Buddhist teachings to the West), and monastic.  Some of his techniques could be useful under certain circumstances, but certainly not as general principles.  His approach seems very Feeler (using Myers-Briggs or Jungian terminology) oriented (I'm in the middle between Thinker and Feeler so I don't particularly enjoy either extreme).  Frankly, I was dealing with Anger as a personal issue especially regarding the 3 poisons of Buddhism (anger, attachment, and ignorance).  This was one of 3 books and 1 video I experienced (including his \\"Creating True Peace\\").  I found the other 2 items far better: \\"Working with Anger\\" by Thubten Chodron and \\"Good Medicine\\" (the video) by Pema Chodron.  They have very simple, yet quite effective (and time tested) Buddhist techniques one can use.  They helped me tremendously.  I cannot, however, say the same for the 2 TNH books I read.  So, you can read this book and get something out of it, but it's not definitive, and there are far better sources and techniques IMHO.	2004-12-23

LeGuin does that in her works.  While this one, a collection of 4 interrelated novellas, is not her best work (see The Left Hand of Darkness or The Dispossessed), it is very fine work nonetheless.  I like it much better than her short story collections (e.g. Orsinian Tales).  This book is about the relationships between politics and people.  It also speaks of the differences and similarities between the internal and the external such that changing external circumstances may not have much lasting effect if the internal circumstances (within the people) don't change.  There is an interrelationship here too.  There are several pithy quotes for my collection in it as well:<br /><br />Love of God and country is like fire, a wonderful friend, a terrible enemy; only children play with fire.  p.57<br /><br />To live simply is most complicated.  p. 90<br /><br />The right use of knowledge is fulfillment.  p.117<br /><br />Loquacity is half of diplomacy ...

It has a great many suspects, as usual the characterization if very fine, I like Dalgleish a lot as a protagonist.  The motive was not all that strong, perhaps, and there were a couple of flaws, but it's well worth the read--far better than most mysteries on the market.  P.D. James is no doubt a fine mystery writer.  If you like this one, try my favorite (but no Dalgleish) \\"Innocent Blood\\" or read \\"Cover Her Face\\" or \\"Death of an Expert Witness.\\"  The biggest problem with P. D.

I like his early works at least as much as his newer ones.  Two cases in point are his terrific \\"One Night Stands\\" and this book.  This book has an interesting structure--written as a series of letters.  Be prepared for the eroticism--not for the very squeamish.  But, the humor is uproarious.  This is far and away his funniest book--I believe I've read ALL of his works except \\"Enough Rope.\\"  It's simply a scream, a laugh riot.

This is a pretty heavy duty mystery with fantastic characterization and the equivalent of an airshow's twists and turns.  Some may very well be put off by the ending, but if they all end the same, where's the mystery?  But, like some of Block's Scudder novels, this mystery edges into the regime of real literature through the author's characterizations -- looking into the depths of humans.  Enjoy.	2004-12-16

Maybe Block will write an Ehrengraf novel some day.  I wish.  Most of his novel series' heros are included here: Scudder, Rhodenbarr, Chip Harrison, and even the intriguing Keller.  A more recent collection entitled, \\"Enough Rope\\" is also available though I believe many of the stories in this book are in that one as well.  My favorite quotes from this book are:<br /><br />\\"Supposition is blunder's handmaiden\\" from \\"The Ehrengraph Riposte,\\" p. 229.<br /><br />\\"Youth is one of those things time cures\\" from \\"The Night and the Music\\" p. 742.<br /><br />\\"He couldn't say exactly why, but he didn't really feel good about the idea of having a relationship with the sort of woman you couldn't give a bear to\\" from \\"Some Days You Get the Bear\\" p. 535.<br /><br />I loved the clever Ehrengraph stories and the touching \\"Some Days You Get the Bear\\" the most.

The author has also written the fine sequel \\"Awakening the Buddhist Heart\\" as well as \\"Awakening to the Sacred\\" (which I didn't like as much as the others.  He's also written a book of Buddhist stories or myths entitled, \\"The Snow Lion's Turquoise Lament\\" which I didn't find all that impressive.  But the book at hand is, IMHO, his best.  No wonder it's a best seller Buddhist book.  Since the author is a Westerner, he can describe Tibetan Buddhism (and Buddhism in general) in a simple, direct manner without using lots of Tibetan/asian mythology, assumptions, etc.  It's relatively easy to pick out such things in other people's religions but not so easy to do your own.  Kind of like withdrawing your projections (per both Jung and Mahamudra).  Surya Das writes in an easy-to-read, engaging style that's almost sure to please the reader.  And, most impressive, he doesn't claim to have all the answers.  Thus, my favorite quote from this book:<br /><br />p. 12 \\"The French writer Andre Gide once wrote, `believe those who are seeking truth.  Doubt those who find it.'\\"<br /><br />This was in addition to the Hasidic story of the Baal Shem Tov about his evaluation of a potential son-in-law.  He liked that the son-in-law admitted not knowing the answers to the questions.  An open mind can learn.  A closed mind cannot.<br /><br />So, keep an open mind about this book.  It's great.  You can follow it up by reading more Surya Das or by reading some of Pema Chodron's works.  She also includes practical activities and meditations to help one along the path of life, whether Buddhist or not.	2004-12-16

I did like his prior \\"Awakening the Buddha Within\\" a bit better (I gave it 5 stars).  For me, 4 stars is pretty darn good!  This sequel is well worth reading.  I think that if you are a Myers-Briggs F-type (Feeler) you will especially enjoy it, but perhaps the T-types (Thinkers) might just get more balance from it.  Surya Das has a very easy-going style but gets across lots of good instruction and some practical activities as well.  He uses lots of personal anecdotes which make the book more accessible than many others that are available.  If I were to recommend books to someone first exploring Buddhism or Vajrayana, his would be at the top of the list (followed by Pema Chodron's books).  Of course, it's lots easier to attune with a Western Buddhist master who shares more cultural assumptions and conceptions with you.  Many Vajrayana books are laced with Tibetan mythology, psychology, medicine, etc. that are, frankly, alien to the Westerner.  Surya Das' books have far less of this.  My favorite quote from this book is: \\"No appointments, no disappointments...Unedit yourself...Become a spiritual astronaut.\\" (page 173).  Pretty modern view, no?	2004-12-16

It is very practical and includes many questions and answers.  My favorite part is pages 86-88 where Chokyi Nyima describes Trekcho and Mental Nondoing quite succinctly (and mentions Togal).  He also has a summary chapter near the end of the book (\\"The Heart of the Practice\\").  He also wrote \\"The Union of Mahamudra and Dzogchen\\" that I enjoyed even more than this work.

The original is one of 3 written by the Wangchuk Dorje (9th Karmapa).  The other two are \\"Pointing out the Dharmakaya\\" (also available in commentary by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche) and \\"Eliminating the Darkness of Ignorance\\" (a translation by Alex Berzin with commentary by Beru Khyentze Rinpoche is also available).  Interestingly, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche previously published a commentary on the very same original text under the title: \\"The Ninth Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive Meaning.\\"  It is also a high quality textbook on Mahamudra, but I no longer own it (gave it away to someone) so I can't do a point-by-point comparison.  This version is said to follow the original's ordering and to be a complete commentary.  It is fairly detailed but is written in an easy to read flowing style.  I would guess the translation to be more aimed at the essence rather than to be literal.  Of course, with the original written in the 16th century it is based upon standard, medieval Tibetan cosmology, medicine, metaphysics, mythology, etc.  It also covers the basic territory of several other Mahamudra books presently available in English.  I don't see much new here though it is well organized and well written.  As Thrangu Rinpoche writes, there are 3 types of practitioners--the one who gets it immediately, the one who kind of jumps around, and the gradual, methodic one.  This book is directly stated to address the last type though it is very useful to the middle type as well.  I find it useful to read many different texts on the same deep subject--I get variety while the knowledge seeps in.  Also, sometimes different hints on how to practice better.  As a scientist (despite the medieval assumptions which are only of historical interest to me), I find the experiential focus of Mahamudra to be highly beneficial and appropriate.  They appreciate the theory, but the real thrust is in the practice and what you get from the experience.  I'll second that.he practice and what you get from the experience.  I'll second that.	2004-12-14

The book is nicely written with questions answered separately, but consecutively by the two authors.  It includes a short Glossary and a number of exercises (some even have drawings).  But, somehow it just doesn't do it for me.  I'd rather read Longchenpa or Tulku Urgyen or his two sons (Chokyi Nyima and Drubwang Tsoknyi).

This book, however, is far less accessible, but its topic may preclude a more personal approach.  It covers a lot of territory though it is quite technical in many places.  It provides an extensive and detailed description of the five Dyani (meditation) Buddhas and their families-the best I've seen.

The author is probably best known for his \\"Foundations of Tibetan Buddhism\\" which is probably a modern classic and for \\"The Way of the White Clouds\\" a more personal description of Buddhism.  The present book also reflects his personal approach which makes it, perhaps, more easily comprehended and accessible than some of the more recent texts translated from past or present Tibetan Buddhist masters.

But whereas the painter consciously transfers his impressions from one dimension to another and has no intention of imitating or reproducing an objective reality, but rather wishes to express his reaction to that reality, the thinker generally falls into the trap of supposing he has grasped reality with his own thinking, because he mistakes the \\"foreshortening\\" perspective of his one-sided logic for universal law.

Gampopa was the primary disciple of Milarepa (famed for his songs & many legends of accomplishments--e.g. reaching enlightenment after having murdered people via black magic).  But, this isn't primarily a Mahamudra (MM) book.  It's more basic.  It's valuable having \\"classics\\" translated, but it's oriented towards Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism) mythology, ritual practices, etc.  IMHO it could have a more balanced approach--though of course it is a Medieval text.  I prefer more practice-oriented works--especially the \\"evanescent\\" (per Namgyal)=\\"skipping the grades\\" (per Rangdrol) type.  This book is more gradual e.g. Lam Rim teachings.  Tsele Natsok Randr&ouml;l in his \\"Empowerment & the Path of Liberation\\" says: p. 67: \\"'The Wish Fulfilling Jewel Ornament of Liberation' establishes an understanding which unifies the 2 streams of Kadampa & MM...it emphasizes the Sutra system, & was written to show the stages of the Mahayana path.  The explanation of emptiness...adheres mainly to the Middle Way view...This book does conform with the general vehicles.  The actual view of MM, however, is clarified in Lord Gampopa's `Revealing the Hidden Points of Oral Instruction,' and other of his works.\\"  So this book doesn't provide a sufficient explanation of MM but does contain a few good quotes: page 144: \\"A Bodhisattva must always think:  Today I will accumulate Merits and spiritual awareness and bring merits to all beings.\\"  p. 231, note #40: \\"Reality has nothing to do with the concepts we create about it and then believe to encompass it.\\"  p. 273: \\"Mind works for the benefit of others without premeditation.\\"	2004-12-10

The author is probably best known for his \\"Foundations of Tibetan Buddhism\\" which is probably a modern classic.  This book is, perhaps, more personal in nature, however.  But, as I've heard Lama Govinda (Anangavajra Khamsum Wangchuk) quoted (but I don't know the source), \\"A religion whose ideal is only a matter of the past or the distant future has no living value for the present day.\\"  He has considerable insight into the human condition and its relation to religion and spirituality as demonstrated in some quotes from this book:<br /><br />\\"Seriousness and a sense of humor do not exclude each other; on the contrary, they constitute and indicate the fullness and completeness of human experience and the capacity to see the relativity of all things and all `truths' and especially of our own position.  The Buddha's sense of humor--which is so evident in many of his discourses--is closely bound up with his sense of compassion: both are born from an understanding of greater connections from an insight into the interrelatedness of all things and all beings and the chain reactions of cause and effect.  His smile is the expression of one who can see the wondrous play of ignorance and knowledge against the universal background and its deeper meaning.  Only thus is it possible not to be overpowered by the misery of the world or by our own sense of righteousness that judges and condemns what is not in accordance with our own understanding and divides the world into good and bad.  A man with a sense of humour cannot but be compassionate in his heart, because his sense of proportion allows him to see things in their proper perspective.  pp. 176-7.<br /><br />\\"Events and facts become meaningful only if seen against the back¬ground of inner experience.\\" 1970 p. xiv<br /><br />\\"Personality consists in the power to influence others, and this power is due to consistency, harmony, and one-pointedness of character.

Thus, many legends exist in virtually all religious traditions that are mythological.  It is unrealistic to assume that your own religion has no such mythology and all others are merely mythology.  In truth they are all a mixture of both types of reality.  Neither should be denigrated, neither should be raised high above the other.  Reynolds magnificently translates and comments upon this key Dzogchen text.  But, he also makes numerous pithy, wise comments of a very general nature about religion/mythology in general.  I think these make this work quite unique and particularly valuable in the study of comparative religion.  I also find that comparing religious views tends to clarify my understanding.  Amazingly enough, the doctrines of Kabbalah and those of Dzogchen and Mahamudra are VERY frequently supportive of each other - if not identical in essence (though differing in terminology, of course).  Thus, I have added a number of quotes from this book into my collection:<br /><br />p. 199: \\"It is only human nature to overlay the history or the biography of a charismatic figure-whether religious, military, or political-with myth, so that this figure comes to approximate a preexisting archetype.  Thus, in later times, what we find in tradition, both written and oral, is not biography in the modern sense but hagiography...But this fact does not in itself disprove the real historical existence of these masters.\\"<br /><br />p. 202: \\"Modern scholars, conditioned by our literate civilization and our text-illuminated educational system, tend to overlook the importance of oral tradition...It would seem obvious that the appearance of a text at a particular time in history does not prove that the ideas the text contains first came into existence when these were written down in that text.  Quite the contrary.\\"<br /><br />p. 203: \\"It is merely the bias of most modern scholars to think that something does not exist unless it is written down in some text.\\"<br /><br />p. 212: \\"Tradition itself is always pointing at a higher source and ultimate origin which lies beyond mere history.\\"<br /><br />p. 294: \\"It is necessary to be aware of the western intellectual tradition and cultural assumptions underlying our everyday use of language because otherwise we can be led into many misunderstandings.\\"ext contains first came into existence when these were written down in that text.

It's short and to the point, emphasizing the analogy of a mirror (not unusual in Dzogchen texts)--but wonderfully orchestrated here.  But, the primary thrust of the text is on Awareness.  For example on page 70, \\"A person who has awareness is very different from the principle behind rules.  A person who has awareness has inner knowledge and acts in accordance with that, whereas rules are necessary when awareness is lacking.  However, sometimes rules themselves can become a means of developing awareness.\\"  And by way of illustration and illumination as to what this means in reality: (page 71) \\"it is written that if a practitioner gets drunk he will suffer in hell; but getting drunk means drinking without awareness.\\"  Awareness is a key concept in Dzogchen -- this book reflects that by shining the light of wisdom on it.	2004-12-09

I had read 1 Thich Nhat Hanh (& heard a public speech), no Thubten Chodron, but several Pema Chodron works before this.  I found both Chodron's works quite helpful, but not \\"Creating True Peace.\\"  Later, I read TNH's book on \\"Anger\\" which seems a bit better--I must have a very different Myers-Briggs than TNH.  While only a Buddha knows what people need, I don't think we should wait to put Bodhichitta into practice (e.g. Tonglen)--learn by doing and dissolve the barrier between subject & object.  I disagree with p. 25: \\"If you do not know how to handle the anger and violence in yourself, it is impossible to help someone else.\\"<br />p. 59: \\"We should not try to help others in an effort to escape our own sorrow, despair or inner conflict.  If you are not peaceful and solid enough inside yourself, your contributions will not be useful.\\"  IMHO de-focusing one's problems by focusing one others' problems can help both; one can work on oneself & help others.<br /><br />IMO, he communicates a SE Asian perspective--not readily transplantable to the West (per Jung's comments).  Also, this book is full of complaints, judgments, & criticisms of the West & devalues science & progress.  This seems one-sided to me.  I agree that Peace is achieved through the transformation of individuals: the 100th Monkey Principle says that when a critical mass of beings embrace something, it spreads rapidly through the whole, as does Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Tipping Point.\\"  TNH says on p. 16: \\"When we hold back our feelings and ignore our pain, we are committing violence against ourselves...do not make war on our feelings or reject them, but just recognize, embrace, and transform them.  When anger or fear is present in us, we bring awareness to it.  We smile to it and call it by its true name.\\"  There's truth here, but not the whole truth.  Buddhist psychologist Anita Barron also viewed TNH's take on anger as simplistic in Marianne Dresser's \\"Buddhist Women on the Edge,\\" & Robert Moore's Warrior archetype, in \\"The Warrior Within,\\" includes purposeful pain & suffering--such as Tenzin Palmo's experiences in retreat (see \\"Cave in the Snow\\" & \\"Reflections on a Mountain Lake\\").

I've been working on my anger for some time and reading this book gives me confidence and methods to complete this important project.  She provides numerous techniques, advice, and comments to approach this problem in a helpful, gentle, and multifaceted way.  Firstly, we must recognize the existence of the anger and allow it to settle:<br /><br />p. 22: \\"Psychologists speak of a refractory period that accompanies an emotion.  During this time, we are closed to any advice or reasonable interpretation that contradicts our view...When the emotion subsides and we are able to look at the event more clearly, we readily see...that anger's interpretation was inaccurate...when we are angry we are, in fact, viewing it through a filter of our self-centeredness.\\"<br /><br />The author makes the important connection between our anger and our self-centeredness-our attachment to our ego.  Furthermore, she observes that we view others as similar to ourselves:<br /><br />p. 71: \\"When our mind is well accustomed to find faults with others, we incorrectly assume they will do the same with us.  Here we have two useless habits to counteract: the first is judging others, and the second is assuming others are judging us.\\"<br /><br />On page 83, she points out that even if we are \\"right\\" it doesn't make us happy, but that acceptance of the reality of life helps us to make the most of our lives-not surrendering to it:<br /><br />p. 88: \\"Acceptance simply means fully accepting that what is happening now is indeed happening, even if we do not like what it is.  We stop fighting the reality of the present moment and let go of our anger.  Nevertheless, we still aspire and work towards improving the situation in the future.  In fact, acceptance of the present enables us to think more clearly about effective means for influencing what occurs in the future.\\" And, \\"If we face an unpleasant situation and can change it, why get angry? ...On the other hand, if we cannot alter the situation, why get angry?\\"<br /><br />She explores different kinds or scenarios of anger situations with numerous examples and makes some less than obvious observations:<br /><br />p. 89: \\"Interestingly, in most conflict situations, both parties feel that the other is more powerful...Because we are interdependent, everyone in a situation affects the others.  However, we are seldom aware that the person we consider powerful is also dependent on others and may at times feel helpless as well.\\"<br /><br />She also provides some less than obvious solutions or antidotes to our anger:<br /><br />p. 96: \\"We can take any pain we experience and give it to the selfish attitude.\\"<br /><br />Ven. Chodron also states what I have been waiting to hear for a long time from the many Vajrayana texts I have read that\\"<br /><br />p. 126: \\"In wishing all beings to be happy and free from suffering, we must include ourselves.  Doing so is appropriately loving ourselves and having compassion for ourselves.  No sentient being is more or less deserving than any other in this respect.\\"  And,<br /><br />p. 128: Someone once said, `If we treated others the way we treat ourselves, we wouldn't have any friends.'<br /><br />She also addresses how to help other people immersed in their anger:<br /><br />p. 147: [if you ask someone undergoing anger] \\"What could someone say that would help you at this moment?\\" [it helps them \\"to consider new alternatives].  \\"What could someone have said to you back then that would have helped you?\\" [it helps them \\"to look at the situation more creatively\\"].<br /><br />And finally, the strange truth about our anger (per Jung's view that what we project outside of us is often opposite to what is outside), touching off our true compassion & Bodhichitta:<br /><br />p. 149: \\"How many of us get angry when we are really trying to say `please love me'?  And how many of us miss others' pleas for kindness because we react to their outer hostility?\\"ion, why get angry?\\" <br /> <br />She explores different kinds or scenarios of anger situations with numerous examples and makes some less than obvious observations: <br />p. 89: \\"Interestingly, in most conflict situations, both parties feel that the other is more powerful...Because we are interdependent, everyone in a situation affects the others.

Her language is straightforward, her book very readable.  Within its few, tiny pages, it says quite a lot.  The author makes a very interesting observation that there is a strong correspondence between ones inner state and one's outer circumstances.  Which is the cause and which is the effect?  Maybe, per her book, each is both.  This leads her to conclude that we can change both simultaneously.  On page 61, she writes: \\"Synchronicity holds the promise that if we will change within, the patterns in our outer life will change also.  If the people and events of our lives are here because we have drawn them here, then what happens in our lives apparently by chance or fortune is not really accidental.\\"<br /><br />This parallels Jung's view that the therapist and patient become a dyad and progress together.  Dr. Bolen quotes Jung on page 51, \\"'The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: If there is any reaction, both are transformed.'  In some instances, each personality at that exact moment in time may be unusually susceptible to the particular \\"chemical\\" action of the other.\\"  This reciprocity is exemplified in romance.  From pages 55-6: \\"When, in everyday life, a person \\"falls head over heels in love,\\" the loved one has provided the \\"hook\\" that attracts the archetypal projection ...What is seen is an archetypal image that is a projection; put another way `Beauty is in the archetype of the beholder'...That person is then reacted to emotionally as if he or she were one and the same as the image.\\"  Indeed, such relationships are internally/externally reciprocal as well.  Per page 59, \\"the projection may have a Pygmalion-like effect...in some way influencing her to take on the predetermined role...Synchronicity suggests that the outer world really does reflect the inner world, not just that it seems to.\\"<br /><br />In support of her thesis, Dr. Bolen describes the holistic view vs. the limited view using the famous \\"Dermis Probe\\" (Idries Shah's term and book title) of the blind men and the elephant (page 102) surmising that no extant religious view has all the answers.  She asserts on page 76 that psychotherapy helps us to transcend our self-imposed limitations: \\"Often people have been programmed by overly critical or rejecting parents to accept a limited or negative view of themselves or to be suspicious or mistrustful of others...In order to grow, the mental limits are the handicaps that must be transcended.\\"<br /><br />Despite the existence of \\"Negative\\" synchronicity\\" (coincidental events that block, hinder, and frustrate what one is attempting),...when a person is following a path with heart, his or her dreams are usually nourishing...Synchronistically, opportunities seem to open fortuitously\\" (page 94).  This seems to parallel Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow.  She uses Jung's story of the Chinese rainmaker of Kiaochau, on page 98, and Plato's cave story (page 102) to demonstrate the application of this concept.  Though, as she states on page 102, \\"We can never fully grasp what is boundless, infinite, and eternal,\\" she provides an upbeat view of synchronicity and presents it in a manner that supports the use of free will to affect not only our inner selves (Eastern approach) but also our outer selves (Western approach) in an integrative manner-consistent with Jung's views of Individuation.outer world really does reflect the inner world, not just that it seems to.\\" <br /> <br />In support of her thesis, Dr. Bolen describes the holistic view vs. the limited view using the famous \\"Dermis Probe\\" (Idries Shah's term and book title) of the blind men and the elephant (page 102) surmising that no extant religious view has all the answers.

It sheds much light on the topic and helped me to become sensitized to the (once the book was read) obvious signs of codependency in people.  By doing this, it enabled me to avoid situations where I could become codependent in a relationship.  I think that, as in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, there are levels of psychological situations and/or problems.  Thus, there may be people inherently inclined towards codependency, but there may also be people who are thrust into it due to the demands of others.  The latter may find this book incredibly helpful in avoiding such relationships and in helping their dependent person seek real help vs. codependency from another person.  There are also a number of great quotes by the author in this book.  A few are:<br /><br />p. 70: \\"It's hard to feel compassion for someone while that person is using or victimizing us.\\"<br /><br />p. 71: \\"If everything looks black, we've probably got our eyes shut.\\"<br /><br />p. 164: \\"Who we're in a relationship with says as much about us as it does about them.\\"<br /><br />Earnie Tucker (quoted by Melody Beattie)<br /><br />Codependency is not something to make light of, it's as much (if not more) the codependent's problem as the dependent's.  As Caroline Casey humorously noted in \\"Making the Gods Work for You\\" (Harmony Books NY 1998), on page 72:<br /><br />\\"What do codependents see when they die?

This book addresses many aspects of these forces, however, it is more Jungian than Freudian (with explanations of the anima/animus archetypes that greatly effect our relationships with the opposite sex).  Dr. Pederson tries to be impartial because as he states on pages 225-6: \\"Most behavioral research, however, is biased by the fact that the experimenters are interested, covertly or overtly, in establishing a particular point of view.\\"<br /><br />He also addresses the process of projection in which we project our inner feelings, orientations, problems, desires, etc. onto other individuals who are then said to carry these projections.  He states that these are stored in the body on page 220 (note 27): \\"A man's physical body and its various organs often carry the unconscious projections of emotional issues he needs to integrate into his awareness.  These symptoms can lead him to a deeper level of communication with himself if he takes the symptoms as signs of a need to sacrifice the rigidities and narrowness of his conscious attitudes.\\"<br /><br />Most interesting are his observations about the development of projection over time such as on page 87: \\"Early belief systems were undoubtedly so intertwined with projection that there was little, if any, separation between myth and reality.  In this sense, consciousness of the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods was a mythic consciousness.\\"<br /><br />He also addresses love, parenting, etc. such as his observation on page 185 that: \\"We could say that the mother is more instrumental in the development of a man's capacity to receive love, and the father is more instrumental in his capacity to give love.\\"<br /><br />For additional reading on unconscious forces, see: George Weinberg \\"Invisible Masters: Compulsions and the Fear that Drives Them\\" Plume NY 1993 and John A.

Most of us have hidden, unconscious compulsions that control our lives in strange ways.  Mostly, when asked, we make up logical explanations (excuses) for what we do.  This book is about compulsions which are based on unconscious motivations.  It helps to raise into the light some of our \\"underwater\\" drivers.  It includes numbers of examples as well as explanations.  My favorite quote from the book is on pages 88-89:  \\"Every compulsive need is reinforced not just by the compulsion itself but by other behaviors that undermine the person.  Identifying and stopping these subtle actions that induce pessimism and hopelessness is absolutely necessary in order to break the grip of compulsions.  It is possible for a person to identify the acts that are maintaining his or her own dread or self-loathing...critical acts re-infecting the person with his dread...eliminate them in order to annihilate any urge for the compulsion.\\"  Also, you might look at: Loren E.

These unconscious forces have profound effects upon our lives, especially upon our relationships with persons of the opposite sex.  This short book, while written some time ago, is still applicable today.  It covers a lot of ground in a short space so it can be a bit difficult or even dense in places, especially if the reader is not intimate with Jungian psychology.  Nevertheless, the concepts (or model, if you will) are valuable and useful in everyday life-not just with romantic relationships, but also with interpersonal communications and understanding.<br /><br />In order to get the most out of this book, it is necessary to keep an open mind.  This can be challenging; as stated on page 9: \\"Even the most elemental knowledge of oneself is something that most people resist with the greatest determination.  Usually it is only when we are in a state of great pain or confusion, and only self-knowledge offers a way out, that we are willing to risk our cherished ideas of what we are like in a confrontation with the truth, and even then many people prefer to live a meaningless life rather than to go through the often disagreeable process of coming to know themselves.\\"<br /><br />Thus, recognition of animus/anima interplay can result in \\"being in love\\" which we resist analyzing and bringing into the everyday world.  From pages 18-19: \\"Relationship founded exclusively on the being-in-love state can never last...being in love is a matter for the gods, not for human beings...it can endure only in a fantasy world where the relationship is not tested in the everyday stress of real life...To the extent that a relationship is founded on projection, the element of human love is lacking.  To be in love with someone we do not know as a person, but are attracted to because they reflect back to us the image of the god or goddess in our soul, is in a sense, to be in love with oneself not with the other person...Real love begins only when one person comes to know another for who he or she really is as a human being, and begins to like and care for that human being.\\"<br /><br />Projection is not, however, a totally negative process because per page 20: \\"Each time projection occurs there is another opportunity for us to know our inner Invisible Partners, and that is a way of knowing our own souls.\\"  Thus, for example, on pages 53-4: \\"In learning to relate to a woman, a man also has to come to terms with the little boy in himself...We have no free choice unless we are psychologically conscious persons,\\" and on page 55: \\"Of the choices every man and woman makes of his or her partner in life; in some way the partner represents something we need to understand about ourselves.\\"<br /><br />But it's not a bowl of roses either because per page. 83: \\"Projections can never be withdrawn completely, for they are out of our conscious control; nor can we ever become so conscious of the inner images of the anima and animus that projections do not occur.  Withdrawing projections does not mean that they no longer occur, but that we understand them as images within ourselves when they do.\\"  But, (page 124) \\"We get well in direct proportion to the energy we put into our psychological development.\\"<br /><br />For additional reading on unconscious forces, see: George Weinberg \\"Invisible Masters: Compulsions and the Fear that Drives Them\\" Plume NY 1993 and Loren E.

It includes an essay on symbolism-a key element in Jungian psychology and a main reason for his break with Freud.  Symbols are necessary to Individuation (the goal of Jungian analysis) per page 99: \\"Symbols are natural attempts to reconcile and unite opposites within the psyche.\\"  And, as Marie-Louise von Franz puts it on page 205: \\"Only by accepting earthly contact and suffering can the human soul be transformed into a mirror in which the divine powers can perceive themselves.\\"<br /><br />This book is easier to read than the symbolism books in Jung's Collected Works.  On the other hand, it really isn't a good survey of Jungian psychology because it doesn't directly address many of his most important topics, but then it wasn't designed to do so.  But, following Jung's essay are essays of many of his immediate disciples who provide pithy commentaries on various Jungian topics-and provide me with more quotes for my collection!<br /><br />Jung does point out a significant practical difference between his psychological process and those of others-he takes the client/patient's intuitions etc. into consideration and that part of his process is to teach psychology to the patient:<br /><br />p. 61 \\"The patients resistance to the analyst's interpretation is not necessarily wrong; it is rather a sure sign that something does not `click.'  Either the patient has not yet reached the point where he understands, or the interpretation does not fit.\\"<br /><br />This book may not be appreciated by left brain Thinker types or adherents to other, rationally-oriented types of psychology.  As Jolande Jacobi says (page 290): \\"People who rely totally on their rational thinking and dismiss or repress every manifestation of their psychic life often have an almost inexplicable inclination to superstition.  They listen to oracles and prophecies and can be easily hoodwinked or influenced by magicians and conjurors.\\"<br /><br />While working as a scientist/engineer for about 39 years, I have interacted with many \\"rational\\" people similarly employed who will cling to (what seems to me) irrational myths of religion, politics, etc. while rejecting any evidence of the existence of the unconscious, the value of dreams, etc.  Me thinks they doth protest too much.sily hoodwinked or influenced by magicians and conjurors.\\" <br /> <br />While working as a scientist/engineer for about 39 years, I have interacted with many \\"rational\\" people similarly employed who will cling to (what seems to me) irrational myths of religion, politics, etc. while rejecting any evidence of the existence of the unconscious, the value of dreams, etc.  Me thinks they doth protest too much.	2004-12-03

In this lovely book, Barbara Hannah elucidates and illuminates this human process of becoming all that we can be (even the U.S. Army recognizes this process!!!).  It is not without heartache.  Per page 128: \\"All steps on the road towards the process of individuation are necessarily characterized by suffering, and this suffering is particularly important for women.\\"<br /><br />The process involves the establishment of balance (reminiscent of the Greats of the past who developed The Golden Mean, The Middle Way, and The Middle Path).  As she states on pages 183-4: \\"It is just as destructive to be possessed by good as by evil, either destroys the balance of the opposites...The ancient Greeks...said, `Exaggerate nothing, all good lies in right measure.'\\"<br /><br />But there are dangers on the way:<br /><br />p. 200: \\"for those who have experienced it, the inner world is an inexorable reality, more basically real and more uncompromising than the outer, which is all that most people see.\\"<br /><br />p. 231: \\"no human being can identify with an archetype unpunished.\\"<br /><br />p. 293: \\"panic...is always the only real danger in working with the unconscious.\\"<br /><br />p. 300:  \\"Somewhere we always resent the loss of freedom that love involves.\\"<br /><br />p. 221: \\"If consciousness is to increase, if wholeness is to become more accessible, tradition must suffer some shattering setbacks.\\"<br /><br />This is a wonderful book that points out the goal, the direction to get there, and the obstacles along the way.

This dissociation is bridged by the assimilation of the unconscious contents.<br /><br /> One of the most important things to Jung is the analyst/therapist's psychological state of development since the analysis itself is a reflection of the patient-analyst dyadic relationship.<br /><br />p. 71 the personalities of doctor and patient are often infinitely more important for the outcome of the treatment than what the doctor says and thinks (although what he says and thinks may be a disturbing or healing factor not to be underestimated).  For two personalities to meet is like mixing two different chemical substances: if there is any combination at all, both are transformed.  In any effective psychological treatment the doctor is bound to influence the patient; but this influence can only take place if the patient has a reciprocal influence on the doctor.  You can exert no influence if you are not susceptible to influence.<br /><br /> But, people are primarily unconscious which dominates the analysis/therapy.<br /><br />p. 78 The final appeal to reason would be very fine if man were by nature a rational animal, but he is not; on the contrary, he is quite as much irrational.  Hence reason is often not sufficient to modify the instinct and make it conform to the rational order.<br /><br /> And the primary catalyst is the transference between patient and therapist.<br /><br />p. 134 Transference is the alpha and omega of psychoanalysis.<br /><br /> The therapy is a partnership and the patient must be treated as a partner.<br /><br />p. 147 Consider every dream interpretation invalid until such time as a formula is found which wins the assent of the patient.<br /><br /> And the therapist must be honest within the container of the therapy.<br /><br />p. 145-6 It is therapeutically very important for the doctor to admit his lack of understanding in time, for there is nothing more unbearable to the patient than to be always understood...In the end it makes very little difference whether the doctor understands or not, but it makes all the difference whether the patient understands.<br /><br /> Additionally, one's life experience and age can affect the analysis.<br /><br />p. 39 It seems to me that the basic facts of the psyche undergo a very marked alteration in the course of life, so much so that we could almost speak of a psychology of life's morning and a psychology of its afternoon.<br /><br /> Analysis is an individual effort to individuate beyond the mass of humanity.  Jung states in many volumes the mass unconsciousness of groups of people.<br /><br />p. 6 Since it is notorious that a hundred intelligent heads massed together make one big fathead, virtues and endowments are essentially the hallmarks of the individual and not of the universal man.  The masses always incline to herd psychology, here they are easily stampeded; and to mob psychology, hence their witless brutality and hysterical emotionalism.  The universal man has the characteristics of a savage.<br /><br /> Alternatively, the individuated, wise individual has tremendous influence - a view similar to the Buddhists who claim that a master has wide ranging influence in the entire world.<br /><br />p. 110 We may yet comfort ourselves with the saying of the Chinese Master: `when the enlightened man is alone and thinks rightly, it can be heard a thousand miles away.'f the therapy. <br />p. 145-6 It is therapeutically very important for the doctor to admit his lack of understanding in time, for there is nothing more unbearable to the patient than to be always understood...In the end it makes very little difference whether the doctor understands or not, but it makes all the difference whether the patient understands. <br /> <br /> Additionally, one's life experience and age can affect the analysis. <br />p. 39 It seems to me that the basic facts of the psyche undergo a very marked alteration in the course of life, so much so that we could almost speak of a psychology of life's morning and a psychology of its afternoon. <br /> <br /> Analysis is an individual effort to individuate beyond the mass of humanity.

US	30672120	R3SUYB4JLKTRPW	0691097747	284076906	The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche (Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 8)	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Jung defines his model of the psyche and how it works	With the possible exception of \\"The Symbolic Life,\\" this is my favorite of the books in \\"The Collected Works\\" of C. G. Jung.  Maybe it's synchronistic that one is CW18 and the other is CW8?  In any case, this volume includes Jung's thoughts on many of his breakthrough ideas and concepts and describes his model of the psyche.  His model adds a 3rd dimension (the collective unconscious) to Freud's (conscious and subconscious).  Though, of course, Jung calls the subconscious the personal unconscious.  This 3 dimensional view translates the subconscious into the home of the psychological complexes.  Jung applied the mathematical concept of complexes (a complex number has a real or rational part plus an irrational [I'd call it non-rational] part which is a multiple of \\"i\\" = the square root of minus one).  Jung didn't like what he called neologisms = newly created words; especially when an analogous word was already available.  He also considered himself an empirical scientist and did not believe his theories were the last word in psychology.<br /><br />p. 297 The purpose of research is not to imagine that one possesses the theory which alone is right, but doubting all theories, to approach gradually nearer to the truth.<br /><br /> In this volume, Jung explores the relationships among these three layers of the psyche as related to the real world and our knowledge of it.<br /><br />p. 171 All knowledge is the result of imposing some kind of order upon the reactions of the psychic system as they flow into our consciousness-an order that reflects the behavior of a metapsychic reality or that which is in itself real.<br /><br /> People project their inner psyche upon the external world-very similar to the Tibetan Buddhist Dzogchen and Mahamudra philosophies in which the real world is empty of an inherent nature (it arises only dependent upon causes) and the reality we perceive is an integrated projection of sentient beings, itself being dependently arising.  Of course, Jung did study Eastern philosophies and religions.<br /><br />p. 207 A poorly developed consciousness, for instance which because of massed projections is inordinately impressed by concrete or apparently concrete things and states, will naturally see in the instinctual drives the source of all reality.  It remains blissfully unaware of the spirituality of such a philosophical surmise.<br /><br /> Also, his theory of synchronicity (meaningful coincidences) supports this view of the relationship of psyche to matter.  This is a bit reminiscent of the Einstein's view (now part of modern physics) that matter and energy are of the same nature.<br /><br />p. 215 it is not only possible but fairly probable, even, that psyche and matter are two different aspects of one and the same thing.  The synchronicity phenomena point, it seems to me, in this direction, for they show that the nonpsychic can behave like the psychic, and vice versa, without there being any causal connection between them.<br /><br /> However, the danger of identifying, incorrectly, to the world of matter on one hand is matched by the danger of identifying with the collective unconscious' Archetypes on the other.<br /><br />p. 221 Subjective consciousness must, in order to escape this doom, avoid identification with collective consciousness by recognizing its shadow as well as the existence and the importance of the archetypes.  These later are an effective defense against the brute force of collective consciousness and the mass psyche that goes with it.<br /><br /> Rather balance is to be sought in the Individuation process.<br /><br />p. 223 Psychology actualizes the unconscious urge to consciousness.  It is, in fact, the coming to consciousness of the psychic process.  And--<br /><br />p. 225 Conscious wholeness consists in a successful union of ego and self, so that both preserve their intrinsic qualities.  If, instead of this union, the ego is overpowered by the self, then the self too does not attain the form it ought to have, but remains fixed on a primitive level and can express itself only through archaic symbols...If the ego is dissolved in identification with the self, it gives rise to a sort of nebulous superman with a puffed-up ego and a deflated self.<br /><br />p. 226 Individuation does not shut one out from the world, but gathers the world to oneself.<br /><br /> This implies that we withdraw our projections from the world and make the unconscious conscious.<br /><br />p. 342 Like primitives, we are at first wholly unconscious of our actions, and only discover long afterwards why it was that we acted in a certain way.  In the meantime we content ourselves with all sorts of rationalizations of our behavior, all of them equally inadequate.but remains fixed on a primitive level and can express itself only through archaic symbols...If the ego is dissolved in identification with the self, it gives rise to a sort of nebulous superman with a puffed-up ego and a deflated self.   <br />p. 226 Individuation does not shut one out from the world, but gathers the world to oneself. <br /> <br /> This implies that we withdraw our projections from the world and make the unconscious conscious. <br />p. 342 Like primitives, we are at first wholly unconscious of our actions, and only discover long afterwards why it was that we acted in a certain way.

Jung, Volume 4: Freud & Psychoanalysis	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Differences between Jung & Freud highlight deep psychology	This is one of the better books in Jung's Collected Works though a Freudian would probably not agree.  In Jung's view, unconscious, repressed material is not necessarily factual.<br /><br />p. 95-6 We are thus obliged to assume that many traumata in early infancy are of a purely fantastic nature, mere fantasies in fact, while others do have objective reality.  Experience shows us that fantasies can be just as traumatic in their effect as real traumata.<br /><br />p. 179 The earlier in childhood an impression is said to have arisen, the more suspect is its reality...the earlier a patient places some impressive experience in his childhood, the more likely it is to be a fantastic and regressive one.<br /><br /> Of course, the obvious reason for Jung's split with Freud was over the nature of libido (psychic energy) and whether neuroses were always due to infantile sexual problems.<br /><br />p. 250-1 I cannot see the real aetiology of neurosis in the various manifestations of infantile sexual development and the fantasies to which they give rise.  The fact that these fantasies are exaggerated in neurosis and occupy the foreground is a consequence of the stored-up energy or libido.  The psychological trouble in neurosis, and the neurosis itself, can be formulated as an act of adaptation that has failed...a neurosis is, in a sense, an attempt at self-cure...Though we no longer imagine we are unearthing the ultimate root of the illness, we have to pull up the sexual fantasies because the energy which the patient needs for his health, that is, for adaptation, is attached to them.  By means of psychoanalysis the connection between his conscious mind and the libido in the unconscious is re-established.  Thus the unconscious libido is brought under the control of the will.  Only in this way can the split-off energy become available again for the accomplishment of the necessary tasks of life...a highly moral task of immense educational value.<br /><br /> Furthermore, our response to what happens is our responsibility.<br /><br />p. 177 We must never forget that the world is, in the first place, a subjective phenomenon.  The impressions we receive from these accidental happenings are also our own doing.  It is not true that the impressions are forced on us unconditionally; our own predisposition conditions the impression.<br /><br />p. 192 Nothing makes people more lonely, and more cutoff from the fellowship of others, than the possession of an anxiously hidden and jealously guarded personal secret.<br /><br /> But there are other significant differences.  For example, Jung states that Analysts must themselves undergo analysis, Freudians were not required to do this.<br /><br />p. 198-9 Nowhere more clearly than at this stage of the analysis will everything depend on how far the analyst has been analyzed himself.  If he himself has an infantile type of desire of which he is still unconscious, he will never be able to open his patient's eyes to this danger.  It is an open secret that all through the analysis intelligent patients are looking beyond it into the soul of the analyst, in order to find there the confirmation of the healing formulae-or its opposite.  It is quite impossible, even by the subtlest analysis, to prevent the patient from taking over instinctively the way in which his analyst deals with the problems of life.  Nothing can stop this, for personality teaches more than thick tomes full of wisdom.  All the disguises in which he wraps himself in order to conceal his own personality avail him nothing; sooner or later he will come across a patient who calls his bluff.<br /><br /> In addition, Jung emphasized the use of archetypal symbols to understand unconscious processes and contents.<br /><br />p. 215 the emotional effect of symbols does not depend on conscious understanding.  It is more a matter of intuitive knowledge, the source from which all religious symbols derive their efficacy.  Hence no conscious understanding is needed; they influence the psyche of the believer through intuition.<br /><br /> And, finally, Jung considered himself an empirical scientists attempting to assist clients with improving their life experience and personal growth (cf. CW1-2)-a positive view of life.<br /><br />p. 278 A man must be able to enjoy life, otherwise the effort of living is not worth while.<br /><br />p. 288 Nature, as we know, is not satisfied with theories.gh intuition. <br /> And, finally, Jung considered himself an empirical scientists attempting to assist clients with improving their life experience and personal growth (cf.

He provides analysis and descriptions of the views of many influential thinkers in this area including: Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Mordecai Kaplan, Richard Rubenstein, et al.  The author also includes certain non-Jewish influences such as Paul Tillich. The book is well organized with a heavy emphasis on mythology.  It includes extensive chapter references and recommendations for further reading and study.  It is a winner of the National Jewish Book Award from the Jewish Book Council.  It is a great way to start an enquiry into Jewish theology.  It even includes a few references to Jewish mysticism and Lurian Kabbalah.  The dearth of such references or considerations is not as puzzling as it may seem.  Though Gillman is a big fan of Heschel (who also taught at the Jewish Theological Seminary = JTS) who is considered to be mystical, the influence of Kabbalah at JTS is quite small nevertheless.  Also, Kabbalah has very limited influence upon Rabbinical Conservative Judaism.  This is unfortunate because many of the theological dilemmas presented in this book could be explained through Kabbalah.  Admittedly, Kabbalah is not very organized and one would need to pick and choose amongst its methods, concepts, doctrines, etc.  Additionally, while frequently referring to mythology (and overdoing this by stating that scientific models are myths), he doesn't mention Joseph Campbell.  Furthermore, while Judaism (as virtually all living religions) has been syncretic (borrowed ideas etc. from other religions and philosophies--e.g. Maimonides and Aristotle), Gillman does not invoke any useful concepts (e.g. Karma and Reincarnation) to help with his many theological problems.  Strangest of all, though he references the great Philosophy of Science classic (Kuhn's \\"Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\"), he virtually ignores scientific explanations and approaches applicable to his stated theological problems and challenges.  To ignore this wealth of possibility leaves one with a sense that Gillman has raised more questions than he's answered.  Indeed, he directly implies this in his wonderful Afterward in which he presents a methodology and recommendations for developing one's own personal theology.

It doesn't matter: the material speaks for itself.  I chose 46 quotes from it for my collection.  There actually is a unifying topic, the symbolic life-which Jung makes the object of human development-the life an individuated person leads.  Thus, this book covers lots of ground regarding the way we view the world and the main life roles and arenas we build our lives around:<br /><br />THE NATURE OF THE SYMBOLIC LIFE-[the individuated person]<br /><br />pp. 282-3 the very fact that you live the symbolic life has an extraordinary civilizing influence.  Those people are far more civilized and creative on account of the symbolic life.  People who are only rational have very little influence; it is all talk, and with talk you get nowhere.<br /><br />p. 605 The majority of normal people (quite apart from the 10 per cent or so who are inferior) are ridiculously unconscious and naïve and are open to any passing suggestion...The more people live together in heaps, the stupider and more suggestible the individual becomes.<br /><br />THE RELATION OF SCIENCE TO INTUITION AND SYMBOLS-[science & scientists]<br /><br />p. 251 In all the higher grades of science, imagination and intuition play an increasingly important role over and above intellect and its capacity for application.  Even physics, the most rigorous of all the applied sciences, depends to an astonishing degree on intuition which works by way of the unconscious processes and not by logical deductions, although it is possible to demonstrate afterwards what logical procedure might have led to the same result...Intuition is almost indispensable in the interpretation of symbols.<br /><br />p. 252 Nothing is more vulnerable and ephemeral than scientific theories, which are mere tools and not everlasting truths.<br /><br />THE VALUE OF RITUAL-[religion]<br /><br />p. 271 we should not change anything in a ritual.  A ritual must be done according to tradition, and if you change one little point in it, you make a mistake.  You must allow your reason to play with it.<br /><br />HOW TO PRACTICE PSYCHOTHERAPY-[psychology]<br /><br />p. 276 I talk the language of my patients.  When I talk with lunatics, I talk the lunatic language, otherwise they don't understand me.  And when I talk with neurotics, I talk neurotic with them.<br /><br />PARENTING-[parents and children]<br /><br />p. 485 The behavior of the parents, whether they have open or hidden conflicts, etc., has an incalculable effect on the unconscious of the child.  The causes of infantile neuroses are to be sought less in the children than in the parents or teachers.  The teacher should be more conscious of his shadow than the average person, otherwise the work of one hand can easily be undone by the other.  It is for this reason that medical psychotherapists are required to undergo a training analysis, in order to gain insight into their own unconscious psyche.<br /><br />POLITICS-[government and legislation]<br /><br />p. 564 99 per cent of politics are mere symptoms and anything but a cure for social evils.  About 50 per cent of politics is definitely obnoxious inasmuch as it poisons the utterly incompetent mind of the masses...we are exasperatingly careless when it comes to the even more dangerous collective diseases of the mind.<br /><br />p. 625 no rules can cope with the paradoxes of life.<br /><br />p. 630 reality consists mainly of exceptions to the rule.52 Nothing is more vulnerable and ephemeral than scientific theories, which are mere tools and not everlasting truths. <br /> <br />THE VALUE OF RITUAL-[religion] <br />p. 271 we should not change anything in a ritual.

I think it's a nice introduction and it includes some key concepts, but it's not as good as some of the author's other works--especially the advanced book entitled \\"The Supreme Source\\" which is most excellent.  I also prefer \\"The Mirror\\" and \\"The Cycle of Day and Night.\\"  Norbu is, I think, recognized as one of today's Dzogchen Masters.  However, this short book simply cannot and does not do the subject justice.  I would also recommend the view of Tulku Urgyen and his sons Drubwang Tsokni and Chokyi Nyima who have published a number of fine Dzogchen works.	2004-11-28

It's a definitive text.  Interestingly, the Dalai Lama provides commentaries on two somewhat shorter texts (one by Asanga and one by Nagarjuna) on the same subject in his \\"Illuminating the Path to Enlightenment.\\" This is a free book published by Ranjung Yeshe Publications.  I have attended a weekend with Kelsang Gyatso including empowerments.  It was certainly beneficial.  This was the first of his books that I've read.  It's one of the best of the 5 I've now read.  It does, however, include list after list of entries in a very tightly organized outline-like format.  I find such lists rather mythical because I believe the number in the list more important (and symbolic) than the list itself.  Frequently such lists vary between authors and the entries don't seem to hang together too well.  Nevertheless, this is a a fine commentary to one of (if not THE) classic text on the Bodhisattva Path.	2004-11-28

He's also called: Klong-chen-rab-'byams, Drime Wozer, and Kunkyab Ngoggi Wangpo.  He is very possibly the greatest Dzogchen master of all time--excluding the ones who may be mythological.  It includes the much repeated metaphor of the moon reflected in the mountain lake (though I forget which of the 3 books it was in).  This trilogy is a great classic.  Also read the recent translations of some of Longchenpa's \\"Seven Treasuries\\" though most have not yet been translated.  For a book of excerpts from Longchenpa's many works, read \\"The Practice of Dzogchen\\" translated by Tulku Thondup.  Well worth the effort.  However, the present trilogy is far easier reading than the other works mentioned here.  They are a good start for the student who has already read a couple of introductory texts on Dzogchen (and perhaps Kagyu Mahamudra).	2004-11-28

He uses carefully chosen tales to demonstrate psychological theses in a helpful manner for modern people.  This particular book addresses the latter half of life.  It's simply a delight to read, highly informative and valuable psychologically and otherwise.  It specifically addresses the problems of the aging populace which differ substantially from those of younger people.  Its hypothesis models (in my view) a cyclical trend where one comes back to where one started - but with a qualitative difference.  This resembles a helix wherein one appears (in two dimensions) that one is going around in circles, but in truth one has progressed in the third dimension.  This is like the different ways to look at a push-pen's spring.  You can look down the barrel, and it looks like a circle, but it isn't - because it's three dimensional.  I've also read \\"Beyond the Hero\\" which addresses an earlier period in life, and \\"Once Upon a Midlife\\" which address the middle period of life.  They form a wonderful trilogy.  In this book, there are 16 short elder tales.  Following each tale, Dr. Chinen presents a psychological analysis of the symbolism and deeper meanings buried in the tale.  He also describes in a developmental way (from tale to tale - they are in a definite order in the book), the several psychological tasks challenging an elder.  He differentiates between an elder and the elderly.  The latter are merely old.  The former are on the elder's quest towards fulfillment and wholeness.  This parallels Carl Jung's individuation process.  As in his other works, Dr. Chinen provides extensive footnotes for those wishing to pursue more academic studies of the subject - or just wishing to read more fairytales.  There is a definite parallel between the symbols in these tales and those in dreams.  As always, Dr. Chinen's presentation is beautifully done and the book wonderfully structured.	2004-11-27

I gave it extra credit for breadth.  It has some lovely quotes in addition to Dr. Peter's arguments.  While I think he's noticed some things others have not, I think his argument is still linear.  For example, a supervisor requires a different skill set.  Thus the best worker does not necessarily make a decent supervisor and vice versa.  He even alludes to this in the book:<br /><br />History shows that most men who become great leaders had been incompetent followers.  p. 106<br /><br />However, this book is a fun read and has lots of fine quotes.  Some are quite well known:<br /><br />There is always an easy solution to every human problem-neat, plausible, and wrong. H. L. Mencken, p. 13; and<br /><br />My way of joking is to tell the truth. It's the funniest joke in the world.  George Bernard Shaw, p. 8<br /><br />Some are humorous as well as wise:<br /><br />Sattinger's Law: It works better if you plug it in.  p. 115; and<br /><br />The real purpose of books is to trap the mind into doing its own thinking.  C. Morley, p. 13<br /><br />Some address management and progress:<br /><br />It is more important to do the right thing than to do things right.  Peter Drucker, p. 155; and<br /><br />What we call progress is the exchange of one nuisance for another nuisance. (Havelock Ellis, p. 11<br /><br />And<br /><br />I will go anywhere provided it is forward.  D.

It did the trick.  It's not as comprehensive as Bartlett's or the Oxford Dictionary.  It isn't the story collection of Braude either.  Each of these works has its own uses, though they all employ quotations of one sort or another.  Perhaps, my favorite in this book that I noticed was:<br /><br />The human animal needs a freedom seldom mentioned, freedom from intrusions.

Yet he dismisses without notice this thought because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own reflected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with a good-humored inflexibility greater than most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.  Ralph Waldo Emerson, p. 254<br /><br />But they are food for thought nevertheless.  This short book contain several pithy quotes worth pondering, such as:<br /><br />Information is only a means of insight, and in itself of little or no value; that it is his way of thinking that makes a man a philosopher.  With by far the largest number of learned men, knowledge is a...philosopher means, not an end.  Arthur Schopenhauer, p. 236<br /><br />His view of history is also reflected in his other book, \\"History has much to Tell,\\" but I like his two companion books on metaphysics the best: \\"The Conscious Interlude\\" and \\"The Sanctuary of Self.\\"	2004-11-26

It is well organized and indexed, but a large number of quotes are very large indeed.  It is perhaps dominated by the Bible, Shakespeare, and a few other well-know authors/books.  If you know something is from Shakespeare and you need to know where (which play, act, etc.), this book is for you.  If you just collect quotes, as I do, it isn't all that helpful--Bartlett's is better for that purpose.  Also, see Lieberman's 3500 quotes book and, especially, Braude's book of speakers' stories (exceptionally good).  So, the Oxford book is a 3 or a 5 depending on how you want to use it.  So, I gave it a 4.  What can you do?  As Virgil (as quoted in the book) says: \\"Trust one who has gone through it.\\"  Great reference text, but not a book to read through, IMHO.	2004-11-25

Here are just a few examples:<br /><br />When Thomas Jefferson presented his credentials as U.S. minister to France, the French premier remarked, \\"I see that you have come to replace Benjamin Franklin.\\" \\"I have come to succeed him,\\" corrected Jefferson. \\"No one can replace him.\\" p. 336<br /><br />There is a monument in Gettysburg to honor the memory of a color-bearer who became isolated from his regiment after a charge. The regiment retired, but the color-bearer and several men held their ground. The Major sent a messenger through to the boy, \\"Bring the colors back to the regiment.\\" The boy replied, \\"Bring the regiment back to the colors.\\" George W. Olinger, p. 84<br /><br />After President Coolidge issued his famous \\"I do not choose to run\\" statement, he was besieged by reporters seeking a more detailed statement. One more persistent than his fellows followed Mr. Coolidge to the door of his library. \\"Exactly why don't you want to be President again, Mr. Coolidge?\\" he asked. Coolidge turned and looked him squarely in the eye, \\"Because,\\" he answered, \\"there's no chance for advancement,\\" p. 17<br /><br />Also, some humor mixed with wisdom:<br /><br />Once a week the road-sweeper came by with his brush. He was a friendly old fellow; and Miss Gidding at the Hollies, got into the habit all that summer of taking him a glass of lemonade and a slice of cake. He thanked her shyly, and that was all. But one evening there came a knock at the back door of the Hollies. The road-sweeper was there, a cauliflower in one hand and a bunch of sweet peas in the other. He seemed embarrassed as he said, \\"I've brought you these, ma'am, for your kindness.\\" \\"Oh, you shouldn't,\\" exclaimed Miss Gidding, \\"It was nothing.\\" And then, the road-sweeper said an odd thing. \\"Well, no,\\" he agreed, \\"maybe it wasn't much, really ma'am. But it was more than anybody else did.\\" (From 500 Tales to Tell Again, H. L. Gee, Ed., London Epworth Press), p. 161<br /><br />A professor who has taught for many years was counseling a young teacher. \\"You will discover,\\" he said, \\"that in nearly every class there is a youngster eager to argue. Your first impulse will be to silence him. I advise you to think carefully before doing so. He probably is the only one listening.\\"  p. 382.)<br /><br />And ones that really make you think:<br /><br />In a talk to the graduating class at Smith College, Adlai Stevenson once told his listeners that the \\"self-adjusted\\" people who fit painlessly into the social pattern may not be the most valuable citizens. \\"While I am not in favor of maladjustment,\\" he added, \\"I view this cultivation of neutrality, this breeding of mental neuters, this hostility to eccentricity with grave misgiving. One looks back with dismay at the possibility of Shakespeare perfectly adjusted to bourgeois life in Stratford, Wesley contentedly administering a county parish, George Washington going to London to receive a barony from George III, or Abraham Lincoln prospering in Springfield with nary a concern for the preservation of the crumbling union. What is needed,\\" continued Mr. Stevenson, \\"is not just well-adjusted, well-balanced personalities, not just better groupies and conformers but more idiosyncratic, unpredictable characters; people who take open eyes and open minds out with them into the society which they will share and help to transform.\\"  p. 281<br /><br />An old man was living with his son at an abandoned fort on the top of a hill, and one day he lost a horse. The neighbors cameto express their sympathy for this misfortune, and the old man asked, \\"How do you know this is bad luck?\\" A few days afterwards, his horse returned with a number of wild horses, and his neighbors came again to congratulate him on this stroke of fortune, and the old man replied, \\"How do you know this is good luck?\\" With so many horses around, his son began to take to riding, and one day he broke his leg. Again the neighbors came around to express their sympathy, and the old man replied, \\"How do you know this is bad luck?\\" The next year there was a war, and because the old man's son was crippled, he did not have to go to the front.

US	30672120	R1G0MA9FKIG88A	0791411907	404777025	Studies in the Zohar (Suny Series in Judaica)	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Nice Start--worth 3.5 stars	The author utilizes several views to analyze the Zohar.  This book is probably as good as Scholem's short work on the Zohar.  The English translation of the Zohar (or Sepher ha Zohar or Book of Splendor) is 2000 pages long in 5 volumes (by Simon, Sperling, et al).  It is only a partial translation as much of it was untranslatable due to symbolism, plays on words, etc.  Thus, most modern \\"commentaries\\" on the Zohar are less than adequate--most are quite short and simply don't even come close to doing it justice--even when limiting themselves to a few topics of interest.  This book is no exception.  Furthermore, many modern works are academic exercises without benefit of actual Kabbalistic experiences--meditations, visualizations, etc.  Still, the author seems to be respectful of the root text and perhaps I expect too much from modern works.  He shows his sensitivity in my favorite quote in his book on page 56: \\"The inner world of man's imagination took precedence over the external world.  The latter owed its very existence to the external projection of thought by means of words.\\"	2004-11-23

Yet, Gikatilla was a great Kabbalistic master.  On the other hand, Moses de Leon's works have suffered the same fate (you can now read Eliot Wolfson's translation of de Leon's \\"The Book of the Pomegranete\\").  While Gershom Scholem attributes authorship of the Zohar to de Leon, Moshe Idel attributes it to a group of Kabbalists working together (possibly using a discovered fragment) including both de Leon and Gikatilla.  I think Idel's theory is more tenable than Scholem's.  In any case, this book by Gikatilla presents the various Sefirot with some information on how they interact with people, but with little practical instruction for the practitioner.  It's more a theoretical work.  Still, it is of great historical significance.  But, it's not the Zohar, Sepher Yetzirah, or Sepher ha Bahir either.	2004-11-23

This was later published in book form--this is that book.  It is NOT a good first-timer, entry-level book on Kabbalah.  It IS a wonderful reference work on the subject--probably the best in existence.  It's entries are voluminous, even exhaustive.  He includes short biographies of major Kabbalists as well as chapters on the main concepts of Kabbalah, origins, etc. etc. etc.  Kabbalah, by its very nature, is not a unified study or set of beliefs, but the thinking of many, varied mystics over centuries.  Many of the ideas evolved, and like virtually all of Judaism, includes disagreements, antithetical arguments, and historical developments (see the Talmud or even, to a smaller extent, the Zohar).  As Scholem stated elsewhere in reference to the Kabbalists, \\"Like all mystics, they were at once conservatives and radicals\\" in \\"The Messianic Idea in Judaism\\" Schocken Books NY 1971 page 48.  Furthermore, as he stated in \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\" (Schocken Books NY 1972) on page 229, \\"The study of mysticism is similar to the attempt to imagine the content of a shell whose core has never been seen by the scholar\\" quoted by Moshe Idel in \\"Kabbalah: New Perspectives\\" (Yale University Press New Haven, CT 1988) on page 37.  Thus, while this book is a work of art (or at least of scholarship), is not a practitioner's manual.  However, practicing Kabbalists would do well to absorb the important concepts, background, and context provided so well in this and other Scholem works.  As  Knowledge Management teaches us, you don't have knowledge without context, and knowledge is actionable, information is not.	2004-11-23

The rest was to a large degree untranslatable due to its symbology, plays on words, etc.  Yet, the authors (and it took a team to do it) did a great service to Kabbalah in particular and mysticism in general but completing this herculean effort.  The Zohar presents itself as a Midrash or commentary on the Bible.  This is an ancient literary form.  It attributes its authorship to Shimon bar Yohai, an ancient Kabbalistic master who is also the main character in the book.  To a large degree, the book is about the wanderings of this itinerant master with his disciples--especially their discussions and encounters.  Gershom Scholem attributes the work to Moses de Leon in medieval Spain.  de Leon claimed that he discovered the text but didn't write it.  Moshe Idel argues that de Leon (judging from his other works, for example) could not have written it alone, was evidently part of a Kabbalistic circle of masters including Joseph Gikatilla, and that it was written by the group (perhaps based on a discovered scrap or fragment).  Who knows?  The work stands on its own as the reputedly greatest Kabbalistic work of all time.  However, anyone at all familiar with Kabbalah knows how steeped in symbolism it was.  Indeed, much of it was passed on by word of mouth.  Thus, publication of the Zohar was a watershed event.  The only other great work that might rival it, Moses Cordovero's \\"Garden of Pomegranetes,\\" has not been translated into English, unfortunately.  The Simon, Sperling, et al translation is by far the most comprehensive (as far as I know) and does include some descriptions and analysis, but it is most definitely NOT a commentary on the Zohar.  Most of them are one volume long and not all that helpful (see Scholem's or Yehuda Liebes's commentaries).  So, whatever you do, do NOT make this your first read Kabbalah book.  Rather, read some of the numerous introductory books (e.g. \\"Introduction to Cabala\\" by Halevi) or any of many others.  Then try some intermediate texts and commentaries such as those of Aryeh Kaplan (he did commentaries on the Bahir, Sepher Yetzirah, and Nachman's Tales) and, above all read lots of Gershom Scholem's works, especially \\"Kabbalah\\" and \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism.\\"  Then, and only then, try this book.  Its a challenge, but well worth the time for those who are ready for it.  I found it to be complicated and very variable as to style.  There are straight-forward (though symbolic to a degree) teaching stories as well as rather mysterious passages of unknown intention.

There were, however, earlier movements called Hasidic in Western Europe (i.e. Germany) sometimes referred to as Ashkenazi Hasidism.  The movement in question, however, was started by the Baal Shem Tov (acronym = Besht) or Master of the Good Name.  There are many magical tales about the Besht and his disciples (see books by Martin Buber, Aryeh Kaplan, and Elie Wiesel).  Moshe Idel is a fine writer.  His most famous work (taking issue with Scholem in a number of issues) is \\"Kabbalah: New Perspectives.\\"  Idel has no problem creating his own ideas and innovations.  He has also written an impressive trilogy of works about the great ecstatic Kabbalistic master, Abraham Abulafia (\\"Language, Torah, and Hermaneutics in Abraham Abulafia,\\" \\"The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia,\\" and \\"Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah\\").  They are worth reading--especially the last one.  Thus, Idel has delved deeply into ecstatic mysticism.  This work might serve as an introduction into his works on Abulafia, but only to a degree.  Those are much deeper, more difficult texts.  This one could be read by the beginner or someone interested in Hasidism.  My favorite quote in this book is: [referring to the Maggid of Koznitz who presented himself \\"as a servant that is standing before God ready to be sent\\"]\\"...consistent with the view of R. Levi Yizhoq, mainly that by annihilation one expands his capacity to receive the influx even more than before he annihilates himself\\" on page 317 (N106).  This is reminiscent of both Eliade's \\"Shamanism\\" and Machik's \\"Chod\\" practices in Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana).  As Jung reported in \\"Man and his Symbols,\\" on page 102, when a Rabbi is asked, why no one sees God anymore, he replies - `no one can stoop so low.'

As usual, he brings both his scholarship and his experiential Kabbalah into his work.  There are other translations, but the symbolic nature of these teaching stories necessitates either a good and extensive commentary by the translator/author or a huge background in the subject by the reader.  As usual, Kaplan provides considerable, quality commentary--that is NOT exhaustive.  But, he opens to door to further research, meditation, etc. by the reader.  Readers might be interested in how modern psychology analyzes and comments upon fairytales--which closely parallel this book.  I would recommend the works of Allan B. Chinen (e.g. \\"In the Ever After,\\" \\"Once Upon a Midlife,\\" and \\"Beyond the Hero\\").  My favorite quote from Kaplan's work (page 247) is: \\"'Since it is the animal in man that causes him to sin, an animal must be sacrificed as an atonement.  The slaughtering and sacrifice of the animal represents the destruction of the animal spirit in the individual...A person vicariously identifies with the animal being sacrificed' (Ramban).  Then by 'following the animals,' he can enter the spiritual realm.\\"  An intriguing perspective, indeed.  The Ramban is also know as Nachmanides, a mystical contemporary of Maimonides.	2004-11-23

This was not an easy task.  It has been hotly debated whether Scholem actually cared about Kabbalah and the Kabbalists or whether he merely treated is as an objective area of scholarly interest.  Either way, he made it his life's work and was eminently successful in his endeavors.  Scholem knew the great psychologist/psychiatrist Carl Jung (though strangely Jung has very little reference to Kabbalah in his voluminous works).  But, Scholem, at least to some degree, seems to have absorbed some of Jungian psychology.  My favorite quotation from this volume is: \\"For the Kabbalists, symbols are not arbitrary or subjective, but have an essential inner connection with what they symbolize.  Symbols are therefore the residue of divine names in human language.  The great faith the Kabbalists had in language was a result of their belief in symbols as the bridge between human and divine language.  In the modern, technological world...the disappearance of public symbols has become, according to Scholem, a 'great crisis of language'\\" on page 125.  I think this is right on the money.  I think it useful (as a Knowledge Manager) to get some context or background before trying to transform mere information into actionable knowledge.  A book like this can help.	2004-11-22

It is far better than the more well known works of Elie Wiesel or even Martin Buber's exhaustive text.  I believe Buber is a mystic, but Kaplan was a practicing Kabbalist.  He brings his meditative orientation (see his 3 books on Jewish Meditation) and mystical analysis talents (see his commentaries on Sepher Bahir and Sepher Yetzirah) to bear in his writings and perspective.  My favorite quote from this book is: \\"Secluded personal prayer (Hitbodedut) is the best and highest level of worship...Such prayer should be in the language that you normally speak\\" from Rabbi Nachman of Breslov's Likutey Moharan Tanina 25 quoted on page 108 of Kaplan's book.	2004-11-22

Today many writers/scholars/professors follow in his footsteps (e.g. Wolfson and Idel).  He, no doubt, did us a great service.  It should be noted, however, that he was an historian--neither scientist nor Kabbalist.  He appears to have faithfully presented Kabbalistic doctrines, teachnings, etc. from the Middle Ages onward.  Nonetheless, the reader should be sensitive to a certain lack of scientific viewpoint on the one hand and mystical/experiential knowledge and orientation on the other--in all of his works.  That said, this is a wonderful book, one of his best (after \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\").  If you like this book, I'd recommend you also read, \\"Jewish Gnosticism-Merkabah Mysticism-and Talmudic Tradition.\\"  The work here illuminates many of the main Kabbalistic concepts regarding the Godhead, including the Shekinah (God's Presence or the Immanance of God, which is female), the Sephiroth (emanations of God), the Zaddik (righteous person), etc.  His voluminous entry in a Jewish Encyclopedia on Kabbalah has also been published as a stand-alone volume simply called, \\"Kabbalah.\\"  This work is highly recommended as it covers lots of ground including major Kabbalists.  Any serious student of Kabbalah will find the present work a necessary addition to his/her repertoire.  My favorite quote from this book is on page 139 where he quotes the Great Maggid of Mezerich: \\"The Tsaddikim make God, if one may phrase it thus, their unconscious.\\" Rabbi Dov Baer of Mezhirech (the Great Maggid) Or Torah (Korets 1804) f. 115b & Jerusalem 1956	2004-11-22

It is a scholarly work and, thus, not easy reading.  But, the author makes many interesting points and has some translations (perhaps, the best part for the more advanced student).  Thus, it's more a book about Kabbalah than a book of Kabbalah.  Nevertheless, a mystic needs to keep his/her feet on the ground as well as his/her head in the clouds.  I find a mixture of theory and practice books is optimal for maintaining balanced growth and progress.  A flavor of the book can be had by reading some quotations I've added to me collection: p. 326 \\"Mystical experience, like experience in general, is contextual.  If that is the case, it follows that mystical visions will always be shaped, informed, and determined by one's institutional affiliations.  The claim that vision is conditioned by pre-experiential criteria renders the very notion of an immediate visionary experience of God or things divine problematic, if not possible.\\"<br /><br />p. 328 \\"Indeed, within the midrashic imagination, broadly defined, there is no hard-and-fast line in the traditional vernacular of the rabbis separating text for exegesis, written from oral Torah.  The blurring of boundaries is evident at both ends: the base text or revelation is thought to comprise within itself layers of interpretation, and the works of interpretation on the biblical canon are considered revelatory in nature.  To cite Bruns* again, the rabbis `imagined themselves as part of the whole, participating in Torah rather than operating on it as an analytic distance..' Interpretation, therefore, can be viewed as an effort to reconstitute the original experience of revelation.\\"  * Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern Gerald Bruns Yale Univ.

If you like this book, I'd recommend you also read, \\"Jewish Gnosticism-Merkabah Mysticism-and Talmudic Tradition,\\" \\"On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead,\\" and his voluminous entry in a Jewish Encyclopedia on Kabbalah published as a stand-alone volume entitled, \\"Kabbalah.\\"  Both this last work and \\"Major Trends\\" illuminate most of the main Kabbalistic concepts (e.g. the Shekinah, the female Presence or Immanence of God).  Any serious student of Kabbalah will find the present work a necessary addition to his/her repertoire.  It's probably the best known contemporary work on the subject.  The historical data has great breadth and considerable depth.  However, it does suffer from Scholem's lack of mystical or scientific background.  For example, near the very front of the book, he asserts that no on would consider the prophets to be mystics.  This is untrue.  Since I consider it so (and he's broken the non-all ness principle), he is simply wrong.  Since a mystic has direct knowledge or contact with God, and prophets have such, they are most definitely mystics.  In set theory they would be a subset of mystics (a circle within a circle on a Venn Diagram).  This does not, of course, imply that all mystics are prophets.  My favorite quotation from this book is on page 229:<br /><br />\\"It says something for its [the conception of the Shekhinah as the feminine element in God] vitality that, despite the opposition of such powerful forces [the philosophers and the strict Talmudists as well], this idea became part and parcel of the creed of wide circles among the Jewish communities of Europe and the East.\\"  Thus, Scholem points out the innovative content of Kabbalah vs. normative, Rabbinical Judaism with its emphasis on the transcendence of a male God.  This book is a close as you get to required reading in Kabbalah for both the scholar and the practitioner.  After all, a mystic needs the balance of having his/her feet on the ground (of good scholarship=good theory) as well as his/her head in the clouds (of meditation and mystical attunement).>\\"It says something for its [the conception of the Shekhinah as the feminine element in God] vitality that, despite the opposition of such powerful forces [the philosophers and the strict Talmudists as well], this idea became part and parcel of the creed of wide circles among the Jewish communities of Europe and the East.\\"  Thus, Scholem points out the innovative content of Kabbalah vs. normative, Rabbinical Judaism with its emphasis on the transcendence of a male God.

It well-illustrates that Judaism had and still has a mystical core.  He included a wondrous quote I've added to my collection, on page 217, \\"Inner silence means having the ability to perceive the feathers weight of the subtlest thoughts that can arise in the mind.\\"  I'd recommend a more basic book first (perhaps Halevi's \\"Introduction to Cabala\\" (sic), then this one, then onto Halevi's \\"Kabbalah and Exodus,\\" Kaplan's three meditation books (\\"Meditation and the Bible,\\" \\"Meditation and Kabbalah,\\" and lastly, \\"Jewish Meditation\\" for more experiential work and Gershom Scholem's many works (especially, \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\").  After these one might tackle Kaplan's commentaries on the Book Bahir and Sefer Yetzirah.  Finally, (after absorbing all of the above) you might tackle the Simon & Sperling translation (2000 pages in 5 volumes) of the Zohar.  Have fun.	2004-11-22
US	30672120	R1ZMRJWC2V4M1Z	9627341320	640234987	Carefree Dignity: Discourses on Training in the Nature of Mind	Books	5	42	43	N	Y	Down to Earth, yet dazzling	This is a wonderful Dzogchen book written by one of the sons of Tulku Urgyen, the great, recently deceased Dzogchen Master.  It is a companion volume to the author's \\"Fearless Simplicity.\\"  But, it's a very different book than that one.  This book includes lectures and questions from students (with answers).  Thus, it is virtually all about Dzogchen (primarily Trekcho and some Togal) without the inclusion of many preliminary practices and Tibetan-specific mythologies.  The author is obviously well acclimated to Western culture-it includes lots of analogies and metaphors using common Western experiences.  The chapters may seem a bit redundant to an expert practitioner, but the author has an uncanny way of using descriptive analogies to hone in on the meaning of difficult concepts and ideas.  As he himself states on page 119, \\"Superficial examples cannot completely illustrate the real meaning, they can only hint at it.\\"  But his hints are very effective.  I've studied Dzogchen for some time and have still been concerned about the use of certain English terms in the translations that don't seem to match the meaning of the speaker.  Tsoknyi Rinpoche provides simple, meaningful explanations of many of these that have cleared up much of the confusion in my mind.  Some examples are:<br /><br />1. Concept-now appears to refer specifically to duality, not all concepts in general: on page 85: \\"Train in the state of naked awareness, free of concepts.  `Concept' here means perceiver and perceived, subject and object.  That's how it really is.\\"<br /><br />2. Clarity-now appears to be referring to the perception of Rigpa rather than the nature of Dharmakaya: on page 86: \\"The moment you recognize Rigpa, there's a sense of being wide open.  Awake.  Free of subject and object, free of thoughts, free of the future, with no dwelling on the present either.  It's like pouring water in a crystal bowl - totally clear.  With the cognizance comes some clarity, some brightness.  Not the brightness from the electric bulb or daylight but an internal sense of being lucid.\\"<br /><br />3. Diligence-is more like a little push rather than forcing oneself: on page 87: \\"If you don't feel that glad about being diligent all the time, then push yourself, say, twenty percent.  That much is okay.  If it's a hundred percent pushing, you're forcing yourself, and it's like mental torture.\\"<br /><br />4. Habitual attachment-and its relation to who we think we are: on page 87: \\"...habit becomes your personality - and then one day it is you!  Change that.\\"<br /><br />5. The Unity of Emptiness and Compassion-I could never understand why they should be unified, I thought the definitions of the two words was incorrect, but it turns out my understanding of the word \\"unity\\" was the problem: on page 151: \\"the indivisibility of emptiness and compassion means they should be a unity.\\"<br /><br />6. Compassion-relative vs. ultimate: on page 157: \\"Compassion free from concepts is an expression of self-existing wakefulness...There is a way also to be conceptually compassionate, which is different...\\"<br /><br />7. Western vs. Eastern practice-relative difficulties: on page 166: \\"It may sound a little strange to say this, but when one practices in a place where there is no external support for Dharma practice - a place where people don't necessarily respect and praise the fact that you are a spiritual practitioner - maybe it is more possible to be really a genuine practitioner in such a place.  In fact, maybe it is much easier.\\"<br /><br />8. Vajrayana Deities-are they real or only mental projections?  Their relation to the oneness of subject and object:  on page 177: \\"one shouldn't think that deities are totally non-existent and nothing other than one's projection.  It is not like that either.  The deity definitely exists, although not necessarily in a way that is separate from one's own perception...The blessing of Manjushri may involve giving yourself the answer.\\"<br /><br />I actually bought two copies of this book from Amazon-because I've already given one away.on-because I've already given one away.	2004-11-21

The other two: Burglar/Rhodenbarr and Tanner are much lighter, fun, less serious reading.  This particular Scudder continues his personal growth from middle-aged, embittered, alcoholic into maturity.  This becomes apparent to readers who have read many of the others in this series before reading this one.  Some of action is downplayed in reference to character development, which might put off some readers.  A good mystery writer spins a fine tale, but a great mystery writer evolves into a great writer who chooses to write mysteries--evolving the genre into literature.  It seems to me that this is Block's objective, conscious or unconscious as the case may be.  Certainly his poignant descriptions of Scudder's bout with alcoholism is a work or art.  Many sides (some light some dark) are variously depicted in this incredible series.  Scudder is all too human.  Block also includes many memorable lines (which I add to my quote collection) such as: \\"'If it turns out there's life on Saturn;' Elaine said, `and we go there, we'll find out they've got three sets of eyes, and five sexes, and something against the Jews'\\" on page 31; \\"There is, I have been taught, all the difference in the world between the desire and the act.  The one is written on water, the other carved in stone.\\"  on page 131; and \\"The room was thick with two conversations, the one we were having and the one we were choosing not to have.\\" on page 283.

Ingham: Stories the Feet Can Tell Thru Reflexology/Stories the Feet Have Told Thru Reflexology	Books	3	19	30	N	N	Excellent diagrams/photos	This was the 1st book I'd read on Reflexology.  It is included in Naturopathy courses.  It's part textbook part mythology.  The diagrams and photographs are extremely helpful if you wish to try out Reflexology.  There is much information concerning techniques to be used for specific ailments.  But this volume is actually two books stapled together.  They are not integrated at all.  In addition, it's not easy to follow.  It also includes quite a few assertions that seem a bit far-fetched (to say the least).  The author is obviously not a scientist or even a student of science.  I definitely think that so-called scientists has overlooked many potential means of alleviating suffering.  A true scientist is open minded and doesn't pre-judge.  Nevertheless, science is indispensible to understanding alternative methods of medicine and related disciplines.  This is NOT a rigorous book.  It's virtue lies in its prior and future application.  Thus, it has some scientific basis because it primarily relies upon empiricism.  The theory, however, seems a bit off-the-wall and requires verification.  Still, just because we don't know why, doesn't mean something won't work.  Give it a try yourself!  It also contributed a quote for my collection: \\"Not all the water in the seven seas can sink a ship unless it gets inside.\\" by Dr. Fosdick.  Good luck!	2004-11-19

This particular Scudder continues his psychological explorations of middle-aged, formerly embittered, alcoholic, unofficial detective Matt Scudder.  This one has quite a bit of action, as opposed to the last work, \\"Even the Wicked.\\"  A good mystery writer spins a fine tale, but a great mystery writer evolves into a great writer who chooses to write mysteries--evolving the genre into literature.  It seems to me that this is Block's objective, conscious or unconscious as the case may be.  Certainly his descriptions of Scudder's bout with relative morality is fine work.  Many sides of his \\"hero\\" (some light, some dark) are variously depicted in this incredible series.  Scudder is all too human.  Block also coins memorable turns of phrase (some funny), that I add to my quote collection, such as: \\"I could probably be a vegetarian like Elaine, but only if bacon was declared a vegetable\\" on page 215.  I didn't read the series in order, I think it would be better to do so, since they build on each other, and the characters' growth trend and relationships develop through the series which is chronological.	2004-11-19

The other two: Burglar/Rhodenbarr and Tanner are much lighter, fun, less serious reading.  This particular Scudder was his first.  This is readily apparent to readers who have read many of the others in this series before reading this one.  Some of the items might seem irrelevant, but are not in light of the books that follow.  Scudder is an interesting character, an alcoholic ex-cop who is empathetically portrayed as a tragic hero type.  He's all too human.  Block also includes many memorable lines (which I add to my quote collection) such as: \\"Something I learned long ago.  It is not necessary to know what a person is afraid of.

While there is fun in this book (I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars) and a great quote for my collection: \\"I swear, if jumping weren't allowed she'd never get to a conclusion\\" on page 180), this is not, IMHO, his best Burglar/Rhodenbarr book.  Try \\"The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams\\" or the new \\"The Burglar on the Prowl,\\" for instance.

It has lots of valuable photos and diagrams and verbal descriptions.  As to the accuracy of Iridology as a discipline, time will, hopefully, tell.  It does seem a stretch, but odder things have happened.  I'm reserving judgment.  It's organization is interesting, but it is rather easy to read.  It also has a fine quote for my collection: on page 333, a poem entitled-- \\"Things Not Done Before:<br /><br />The things that haven't been done before, Those are the things to try<br /><br />Columbus dreamed of an unknown shore, at the rim of the far-flung sky.<br /><br />And his heart was bold and his faith was strong, as he ventured in dangers new.<br /><br />And he paid no heed to the jeering throngs, or the fears of the doubting crew.<br /><br />The things that haven't been done before are the tasks worthwhile today.<br /><br />Are you one of the flock that follows or are you one of the timid souls that quail<br /><br />At the jeers of the doubting crew, or dare ya, whether you win or fail,<br /><br />Strike out for the goal that's new?<br /><br />This could be the theme for potential practitioners of Iridology.	2004-11-19

It's nicely done too.  He also provided a very fine and useful quote for my collection: \\"People are attached to their own way of looking at things.

As a collector of quotes, my favorites from this book are:<br /><br />p. 58: What a laugh, though.  To think that one human being could ever really know another.  You could get used to each other, get so habituated that you could speak their words right along with them, but you never know why other people said what they said or did what they did, because they never even knew themselves.

Oscar Levant<br /><br />Men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all the alternatives.  Abba Ebon<br /><br />It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.  Alfred Adler<br /><br />In the final analysis it is not what you do for your children but what you have taught them to do for themselves that will make them successful human beings.  Ann Landers<br /><br />No man can consider himself truly married until he understands every word his wife is not saying.  Lord Mancroft<br /><br />You can't push a wave onto the shore faster than the ocean brings it in  Susan Strasberg<br /><br />All our final decisions are made in a state of mind that is not going to last.

I think it might have been more exciting to have it written from Reba's point of view.  Still, the auther tried something new to a degree here.  As Kinsey says at the very end of the book (page 352), \\"In the passing drama of life, I'm usually the heroine, but occasionally I'm simply a minor character in someone else's play.\\"  Kinsey appears rather weak in this book--not in the psychological way she has before (e.g. dealing with her family) but in her relationships with Reba and even Cheney, her new boyfriend.  I do think it's about time she had some kind of reasonable relationship with a man.  Perhaps some maturity and personal growth is happening.  As Kinsey says on page 29, \\"I couldn't tell if the ticking I heard was my biological clock or the delayed timing device of a bomb.\\"  It does make me interested to see what the \\"S\\" entry in the series will be like.  Overall, it's a nice, readable series.  The books do not need to be read in order, this could be your first one, but (as stated above) it's not the usual one.	2004-11-15

This is one of the best.  The fact that the author has also published more advanced texts (e.g. \\"The Work of the Kabbalist\\" and \\"School of Kabbalah\\") attests to his intimate knowledge of the subject.  But, those texts (as well as translations of older ones such as Gikatilla's \\"Gates of Light\\") are quite obtuse without a solid background in the basics.  Havlevi (a pseudonym for Warren Kenton) has written several entry level books of high quality.  This is one of the best, and probably the one to read first.  My favorite quotation from this book (I collect quotes) is: \\"The rabbis have said that the reason for Existence is that it acts as a vast mirror of contemplation by which God may behold God...the Holy One beholds the Holy One through our experience.\\"  1991 edition, p.202	2004-11-14

The authors also provide a short \\"test\\" to see if you qualify as a CC.  This is not really a new idea.  Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs has as the apex of his pyramid, \\"Self-Actualization.\\"  This corresponds to Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory where seeking the positive is considered qualitatively different from seeking to avoid the negative.  In addition, the Normal distribution indicates that there will be declining numbers of persons in groups deviating from the Mean (average) in a non-linear way (i.e. in accordance with the standard deviation of the distribution).  However, the authors do provide lots of backup material and some interesting observations on the nature of the CCs.  Some of them seem a bit far out to me--too left wing rather than balanced.  I think a reader's reaction to this book will primarily lie in his or her psychological and political positions on the human spectrum.  Thus, there are liable to be highly divergent ratings of this book from various people.  It is, by the way, a rather heavy tome (literally).  My favorite quote from it is: \\"The media have announced a hundred of the last ten medical breakthroughs\\" on page 223.	2004-11-14

This is NOT one of them.  Of the dozen of his books I've read, I'd rate this my favorite.  Probably because it's one of the most advanced.  The other advanced (and more practical in the generic sense) is \\"School of Kabbalah\\").  Halevi is a practicing Kabbalist, as opposed to Kabbalistic historians such as Gershom Scholem.  Each has his/her place.  I'd recommend a sound grounding in Kabbalah before tackling this book.  Read some Scholem and some of Halevi's other works first.  This is a fine book which includes exercises and visualizations appropriate to the aspiring Kabbalist.  It is somewhat reminiscent of \\"The Shining Paths\\" by Ashcroft-Nowicki but, perhaps a bit more down to earth.  Advanced mystics know that one has to keep one's feet on the ground while one's head is in the clouds.  Halevi has his sights set.  As he stated in \\"Introduction to the Cabala\\" (or the \\"Tree of Life\\"), Samuel Weiser, York Beach, ME 1972/1991 p.202, \\"The rabbis have said that the reason for Existence is that it acts as a vast mirror of contemplation by which God may behold God...the Holy One beholds the Holy One through our experience.\\"  Tread the Path, but tread it carefully.	2004-11-13

I think it's the lowest of the 3 in quality.  The 2nd was \\"The Unexpected Guest,\\" and the 3rd was \\"Spider's Web.\\"  All 3 read more like plays than novels--so if you are expecting the normal Christie novel, you may very well be disappointed.  However, if you have read the novels, this is a nice addition to your list of Christie's and a rare opportunity to envision her plays.  True, the plays could just as easily have been bound and published.  But, Osborne has apparently done little, if anything, to detract from the plays themselves.  So, IMHO, he has done a service both to Christie and to the mystery reading public by publishing these works.  As for the content, this particular work is rather straight-forward, lacking some of Christie's usual twists and turns, cleverness, etc.  It is the only one of the 3 plays that includes one of her 3 usual \\"detectives\\" (Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, and Tommy & Tuppence).  This play is a Poirot adventure, but it's not anywhere near one of the best.  It is, however, a Christie.  If you've read all the others, it's one more to read.  So, do your best to enjoy what may be your final opportunity.	2004-11-12

Psychologically and scientifically speaking, it is probably more likely that the informational content originated in the psyche (unconscious mind--either personal or collective or both) of the author(s).  Also, Edgar Cayce, when asked about channeling, said that there's no reason to think your uncle knows more after he's gone than when he was on Earth.  Nevertheless, the material, whatever the true source, should stand on its own.  There is some interesting material in this book, however, I believe Stewart Edward White's works (from the beginning of the 20th century) are superior.  And, of course, there is also \\"Our Unseen Guest\\" by Darby and Joan.  More recent books in the same vein include the popular \\"Conversations with God\\" series by Neale Walsch.  The best of such works create a consistent (though unverifiable) metaphysical world--though their interpretation of (usually deceased) spirits is actually unnecessary.  Interestingly, however, the Seth books are antithetical to the metaphysical world of the other works mentioned (though the others seem consistent with each other).  Based upon these books and others addressing metaphysical themes, I have problems with the metaphysical assertions of \\"Seth.\\"  If you read this book, you might consider holding your opinion (either pro or con) of its source aside and assessing the value of the material as it is--disregarding the stated source.	2004-11-12

That, in itself, is not unusual, but it differs from her other books dramatically as well.  Even ignoring the basic structural differences, it seems to me that usually her murderers are relatively straightforward in their psychologies.  In this one, however, she touches on evil of a more absolute nature.  I have searched and failed to find the poem that I memorized--which I'm pretty sure was in this book.  It goes:<br /><br />  Every night and every morn, some to misery are born.<br /><br />  Every morn and every night, some are born to sweet delight.<br /><br />  Some are born to sweet delight, some are born to endless night.<br /><br />I think it gives the essence of what the book is trying to say--far beyond being a mystery novel.  If you want to see Christie in more serious, perhaps enigmatic, statement, read the book.  Don't expect the usual Christie.	2004-11-12

This is a fun little book chock full of wise sayings gleaned from episodes of the original Star Trek.  The original was not a space opera, it was a futurized series of life's lessons, very carefully crafted.  Each episode had a heavy-duty message embedded within--and not very hard to spot either.  This book does not necessarily include these thematic messages, but it does excerpt a number of pithy, humorous quotes from the characters.  It is highly reminiscent of a poster my dentist has in his office of Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.  I expect there is also a book with that name, but I haven't read it.  These words of wisdom also remind me of Dr. Akin's famous \\"Laws of Spacecraft Design\\" which you can access on the internet.  With his permission, I used several in my book \\"The Knowledge Management and Information Technology Encyclopedia\\" (published by the Government and not for sale).  My favorite submits from Marinaccio's delightful book are:<br /><br />Gossip is often confused with conversation.  In fact it often takes the place of conversation.

Interestingly, Hinduism has constructed a wonderful model that differentiates among and between these seemingly divergent paths up the spiritual mountain (or paths to God for Theists).  These include: Karma Yoga (addressing action) and Bhakti Yoga (of devotion) included in one volume; Raja Yoga (of mind, but addressing more psychic development); and Jnana Yoga (of wisdom).  The latter is more difficult, IMHO, to find out about.  Religions generally specialize in one of these four with additional elements (sometimes only in subsets such as clerics or monks) from some of the other ones.  Jnana or Gnani appears to be among the rarest.  Thus, having read this book is a great coup in understanding the higher philosophies and theological approaches to Omneity or spiritual development.  In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, it would be applicable to Dzogchen and Mahamudra as opposed to the more normal or pervasive Vajrayana practices.  IMHO, Jnana (and its equivalents in other religions) is the most profound of teachings.  Vivekananda was obviously a Master and has presented a wonderful exposition on this esoteric subject.  We are privileged to have the opportunity to read and study it.	2004-11-11

Of course, storytelling has been a (if not the) major means for transmitting wisdom and knowledge throughout the generations since the dawn of time.  What Denning has done in this book, however, is both to popularize storytelling as a management technique suitable for contemporary change agents, but also to provide some analysis as to what constitutes a \\"springboard\\" story--one that is effective in effecting change.  His appendices provide some matrixed data to support his analyses and guide the reader in implementation.  Some of the factors making \\"springboard\\" stories effective are intuitive.  A true story is more effective; a story involving one's own organization is more effective... This book is not a cookbook for devising/using these stories, rather it is more descriptive and represents more of an initial foray into the value and use of storytelling.  It could use a sequel and, perhaps, a statistical analysis.  Furthermore, it can be less than an exciting read.  Indeed, one wonders if there is too much detail or too much autobiography in parts.  Nonetheless, it is a fundamental classic of present-day Knowledge Management and provides an ingress into the fascinating world of applying human psychology in organization management.	2004-11-10

It's like a General Systems Theory (GST) approach to metaphysics or an attempt to evolve physics into metaphysics--though that may not have been the authors' intention.  General Systems Theory is an attempt to codify basic laws of nature across a multiplicity of disciplines.  Certain equations, for instance, are virtually identical (except for embedded constants) in widely divergent fields.  This volume provides a number of general principles which it claims to be relevant across highly divergent circumstances.  The principles concern both human behavior (at least as a referent or resultant) and the basic laws of nature.  They remind me a bit of Activation Theory in psychology (also called Arousal Theory).  This involves the application of the Normal Distribution (a general principle of statistics, humans, and life) to human activity and its effectiveness.  Maybe that's a stretch in reviewing this book, maybe not.  In any case, I usually give away books after I've read them.  I keep precious few for reference or loan.

These leaders covered a broad spectrum of Jewish beliefs and denominations.  This is evident in their questions as much as in their various affiliations.  The visit merely touched upon the many similarities between certain Tibetan Buddhist (Vajrayana) and Jewish beliefs.  It was oriented more towards beliefs than practices except in the area of particular interest to the Dalai Lama: how Judaism and the Jewish community survived centuries of exile.  This is an obvious question considering the recent exile of the Dalai Lama from Tibet due to the Chinese takeover of his country.  As a scribe and not a knowledgable participant, Kamenetz cannot and generally does not analyze similarities and differences--he's not well qualified to do so as he readily admits.  While in summary, it may appear that Judaism and Vajrayana are vastly different (and in some ways they are), if one separates the Jewish representatives' views and compares each one to the Dalai Lama's, a different picture emerges.  The more traditional or orthodox or literalist views are essentially antithetical to the Vajrayana, but the mystical ones have much in common with it.  Since the discussion was shared amongst the Jewish representatives, the more mystical representative (and one wonders how mystical he actually is) only had a limited time for discussion/presentation.  Thus, the similarities were only touched upon.  I would suggest that this is a fine introduction to these similarities, but since it only scratches the surface, further study is required.  The high philosophical, esoteric, and metaphysical views of the two are frequently quite close.  For example, as opposed to what some of the Jewish leaders may say about reincarnation, the Jewish mystical tradition (i.e. Kabbalah) affirms reincarnation (it's call Gilgul).  So, in fact, a literal read of this book can be quite misleading.  Don't be fooled.  The diversity of views within Judaism is far larger, I believe, than that within Vajrayana--and Vajrayana had the Rime movement which drew the views closer together in recent decades.  It is unlikely that such will occur in Judaism due to the differences in literalist and representational views of Jewish revelation.  It is strongly advised that the reader pursue studies in both Kabbalah and Vajrayana (preferably Dzogchen and/or Mahamudra) to realize the depth and breadth of the similarities.Don't be fooled.

However, it is not for everyone.  I'd say its a mid-level Tibetan Buddhist text.  For the most part, it is a commentary on the famous Tibetan Book of the Dead (that Evans-Wentz translated into English).  The original text is dramatically Tibetan (more than Buddhist) and (for those not intimate with Tibetan Buddhism = Vajrayana) very obtuse.  It assumes agreement on lots of things including the most basic one: reincarnation.  Actually, it might be better described as transmigration because the Tibetans (as opposed to Western mystics) believe people can be reborn as animals or other (mythical) beings such as gods, demi-gods, etc.  The orginial book takes a dying person (it's read aloud to the dying and dead person by his or her master or someone else) through the Tibetan-believed stages of death.  This is not unlike the Egyptian Book of the Dead except that there the stages are more external and spacial whereas here they are internal and concern how the dying person will fare after death (reincarnation, birth into a Buddhaland, hell, god realm, etc.).  Obviously, one's belief (if one truly does believe) in death will affect one's life.  Sogyal Rinpoche (Rinpoche is a title not a name and it means \\"precious one\\") does the world a service by providing considerable notes and commentary upon the difficult-for-Westerners text.  Indeed, he provides enough generic material on living and dying to broaden the appeal of his text to many others beyond those interested in Vajrayana or ancient texts.  It should also be noted that Sogyal Rinpoche has taken as his mission to work closely with dying people.  So, he seems to practice what he preaches.  Pretty impressive!	2004-11-10

I think this book could be a very useful tool as long as the reader doesn't get lost in the fact that it is the author's view and not necessarily accurate for everyone.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the ancient Hekalot literature describing a mystical journey through the palaces of heaven, the Talmudic description of the four who travelled to the Garden from which only Rabbi Akiva came away unscathed, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and the Egyptian Book of Gates.  It can be viewed either as a light story (or myth) OR as a set of highly advanced mystical practices in the Kabbalistic tradition.  Your choice.

These are attributed to Gautama Siddhartha, the historical Buddha.  Numerous versions of various lengths of these sutras exist.  The first of Conze's translations that I read was a collection of the shorter versions of the sutra.  The present volume is a single, middle length version.  It is often referenced or quoted or included in Bibliographies of Tibetan Buddhist works--which utilize or build upon its wisdom (especially the \\"emptiness\\" or dependent-arising nature of perceived reality).  While I value the shorter version book, I consider this one vastly superior.  It seems to be the version most referenced too.  Dr. Conze also published a much longer version (25,000 lines) entitled, \\"The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom\\" which I own but have yet to read.  These texts are not simple, easy reading, but they are profound, high philosophy and/or metaphysics concerning the nature of reality and the universe and humanity's place therein or relation thereto.  They tend to link the so-called Mahayana (Great Vehicle) of Northern Buddhism to Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhism).  They are also a wonderful (and, perhaps essential) precursor for ventures into Kagyu Mahamudra and/or Nyingma Dzogchen teachings as well as the Tantric Buddhism or all 4 schools (these 2 plus Sakya and Gelugpa).  I plan to keep them in my library.	2004-11-06

Notably, he wrote 3 books on Jewish Meditation and commentaries on both the Sefer Yetzirah and the Book Bahir.  His Sefer Yetzirah provides considerable commentary and explanation of the text, though much of it is still a mystery--so don't expect a complete exposition of a definitive sort.  None exists at least in English as far as I can determine.  But, this one is about as good as you get today.  The so-called Book of Creation (actually in Kabbalah/Hebrew it's really the book of Formation since Yetzirah is the World of Formation and Beriah is the World of Creation) is replete with esoteric symbology.  Symbols (as opposed to signs) do not have a definitive meaning.  They aren't supposed to.  They have many \\"meanings.\\"  Thus, this text, though obviously very heavy duty metaphysically, is very difficult to understand today.  It is also one of the 3 main texts in Kabbalah.

It's nicely concise though it does reiterate a lot of basic material.  It does add some very fine specific comments for more advanced practitioners as well.  It is Choknyi Nyima Ripoche's commentary on Karma Chagme's 17th century text of the same title.  It does not, I believe, address the entire original text, however.  This book is a good follow-up or precursor (as you choose) to Gyatrul Rinpoche's commentary on the same Karma Chagme text, published in 2 volumes as \\"Naked Awareness\\" and \\"A Spacious Path to Freedom.\\"  An additional related text, \\"Natural Liberation\\" is attributed to the earlier master Padmasambhava.  These 3 are translated by B. Alan Wallace and, I believe that, the introductions make the connection between the two original texts. However, even the 3 together are not a complete exposition of the Union.  It is unknown if even all 4 texts together completely cover Karma Chagme's original text and its teachings.  The present text by Choyni Nyima (and translated by Erik Pema) is far shorter than the others.  All 4 of these books are high quality, more advanced than most present texts, and well worth reading.  They are among the clearest and pithiest of currently available English translations of Mahamudra and Dzogchen texts and help one to not only understand their relationships, but more importantly to understand the underlying truths within them.  They also provide considerable practical guidance for the practitioner.  Mahamudra is contended to be the highest teaching within the Kagyu tradition (among the 4 Tibetan Buddhist traditions).  Dzogchen is similarly regarded for the Nyingma tradition.  Thus, such original works can be said to address the very highest Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhist) teachings.  While their terminologies differ considerably, the main concepts (especially the view and fruit) of the two teachings are extremely similar.  Authors frequently flip between the two to communicate explanations to the reader.  The Rime movement (supported by such great masters as Dilgo Kyentse Rinpoche and Dudjom Rinpoche) emphasized cross-tradition studies between and among the 4 main Tibetan Buddhist schools, and many contemporary masters also include Bon Dzogchen as well.  This medieval work can be viewed as a precursor to this ecumenical viewpoint.  It is obvious (even in translation) that Karma Chagme was a great, enlightened master.

Notably, he wrote 3 books on Jewish Meditation and commentaries on both the Sefer Yetzirah and the Book Bahir. His \\"Bahir\\" provides considerable commentary and explanation of the text, though much of it is still a mystery--so don't expect a complete exposition of a definitive sort. None exists at least in English as far as I can determine. But, this one is a terrific start. The origins of the 3 greatest Kabbalah books (Yetzirah, Bahir, and Zohar) are shrouded in mystery.  They are attributed to ancient Masters (pseudoepigraphic) which is actually not unusual in medieval times.  Gershom Scholem popularized Kabbalah through his academic studies (though he may not have meant to do this at all) though he was not a Kabbalist.  He was an historian-great historical data but absurd personal opinions.  Not so for Aryeh Kaplan who is obviously a practitioner not just an academic.  Nevertheless, \\"Bahir\\" is replete with esoteric symbolism.  Symbols (as opposed to signs) do not have a definitive meaning. They aren't supposed to. They have many \\"meanings.\\"  Thus, this text, though obviously very heavy duty metaphysically, is very difficult to understand today.  It's relationships to the other 2 main texts in Kabbalah is highly relevant and interesting.  So, along with the Sefer Yetzirah, this is a book for the serious student of Kabbalah to ponder and meditate upon for a long, long...time.	2004-11-04

Since it seems this is a new type of \\"Nameless Detective\\" following \\"Shackles\\" and I have only read books Pronzini co-authored or co-edited with Marcia Muller, I can only compare it to books by other authors and to my personal view of mysteries and literature.  It was a good story; the protagonist has a lot of inner dialog (perhaps due to the prior book's situation?); and the clues seem to lead from each to the next.  The relationship with the mob seems a bit contrived as does the ending.  Too easy.  Also, other than innuendo there isn't much actual data on the mob nemesis' crimes.  He doesn't really seem to have done anything in particular except to force Nameless to meet with him once.  I do think the relationships with Kerry (his girlfriend) and Eberhardt (his partner) seem interesting though not much space/time is really devoted to them.  Also, the other characters (the 4 conspirators over the money, for example) seem a bit stereotyped.  John Wovoka was an intriguing character, but had a small part in the drama.

Like another reviewer before me, I'd rather read the book before I know the plot--especially in a mystery novel.  But, I'll try to provide some value-added in a different regard.  Lawrence Block has basically 3 series.  Two are tongue-in-cheek (the Bernie Rhodenbarr the caring burglar and the Tanner \\"spy\\" series) and one is serious (Matt Scudder).  I enjoy them all, but expect different things from them.  In the Burglar series you usually get a lot of fun with Bernie getting into and out of trouble throughout, with humorous lines, delightful (if sometimes strange) characters, etc.  In this one, the author points out the continuing evidence of lots of coincidences throughout the caper.  He intentionally sacrifices credibility of events for humor and sheer fun.  The Tanner books are similar in that regard.  This particular offering is particularly coincidental and particularly fun--one of the most fun in the entire series, IMHO.  Don't expect a Scudder-type book.  They are wonderful (maybe more so) in their own right, but very different from the Bernie books.  So, if you want a real whodoneit with all seriousness --where you try to figure out the guilty party etc. from the clues--read the Scudder books or Agatha Christie.  If you want a really fun and humorous rollicking read, this is a great choice.  Enjoy!!!  p.s. It probably deserves at least another 1/2 star, but then I like Scudder better.  Don't ask me why.	2004-10-19

The author clearly and concisely delineates the differences between approaches (yanas) but also with Mahamudra and Dzogchen.  He also explains the Dzogchen view of the relationship between development and completion stages--which in the 100 or so Vajrayana books I've read, I've never heard before.  And, it actually makes sense to me!  Amazing.  He also gives a bit of information about the relationship between Trekcho and Togal, though most of this work is more Trekcho oriented.  Overall, the book is written in an easily read style, and the author uses many, many analogies to improve communications and help the reader visualize what is being transmitted.  Analogies, while not actually proving anything can certainly illustrate points being made so as to elicit an understanding response from the reader.  Several chapters of this book are included in \\"The Dzogchen Primer,\\" but they are the more elementary ones and, IMHO, not the really fine ones.  After reading some more introductory Dzogchen and/or Mahamudra books (there are lots of them out there by Norbu or Thrangu Rinpoche or others), this would be a fine book to read.	2004-10-08

Mahamudra is generally spoken of as the highest teaching of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism--one of the four main schools.  It is similar, and supposedly comparable to the Nyingma school's Dzogchen teachings.  Fortunately, the translators (Khenchen Konchog Gyaltshen and Katherine Rogers) have included some explanatory notes which help to round out the text.  The text itself follows the standard Mahamudra traditions (dogmas) including the Tibetan customs, symbols, mythologies, assumptions, cosmology, etc.  Some of these are in conflict with the findings of modern science.  Others are simply culturally specific and different from comparable assumptions/mythologies/customs of other religious groups.  These sometimes (e.g. 100's of thousands of prostrations to imaginal beings) are objectionable to most Westerners.  Indeed, it seems to me that the view of Mahamudra (rather pristine and very high level of abstraction and elegance) directly contradicts many of these practices.  Thus, the book (as well as virtually all the others on the subject) appears to be a compound of ancient, conflicting viewpoints and practices.  It is difficult, at least for me, to reconcile these divergences.  If the reader is well-versed in Mahamudra, this book could be a good addition to his/her reference shelf as it succinctly lists/describes the standard information usually presented in such books.  It would, however, be quite difficult to understand Mahamudra if this were one's first assay into the arena.  For example, it's employment of the Madyamika philosophy's arguments in support of the Mahamudra view are very short and mostly references to other works.  But, then, as a western scientist, I don't think such arguments are very convincing anyway.  What is convincing is the Mahamudra view which is well worth considering and attempting to implement into one's life both during and after meditation sessions.  And, this is the area of great overlap with Dzogchen (The Great Perfection or Great Completion or Ati Yoga).convincing anyway.

Shah is famous for his many collections of them.  I've read 10 of his books.  They are invariably entertaining.  The Sufi masters are referred to as idiots--they can appear as such to the uninitiated.  Reminds one of the story of Elijah and the Hasidic master who asked to accompany him.  The proviso was that the Hasid couldn't question Elijah on what he did--or he couldn't continue.  They visited an old, poor couple who nonetheless shared what little they had with the visitors.  So, Elijah prayed for their only asset (a cow) to die.  Then they visited a rich man who treated them poorly, so Elijah fixed a wall in the man's house which was about to fall down.  After a number of these episodes, the Hasid broke down and asked how Elijah could act as he did.  Of course, Elijah had good reasons (e.g. the wall contained a treasure that the rich man would have found had the wall collapsed and the cow took the place of one of the couple who was about to die).  Similarly, the Tibetan Buddhists have had masters of Crazy Wisdom.  Some of the stories in this particular Shah collection (and the others too) are understandable; some are more like Zen koans.

The first was: \\"The Tree of Death\\" and the second was \\"The Legend of the Slain Soldiers.\\"  However, this final outing was co-authored with Bill Pronzini (who is now Muller's husband).  Pronzini employs his lesser-known (to his famous Nameless Detective that Sharon McCone calls Wolf) Quincannon who lived about a century ago.  I think this trilogy gets better book by book, so I actually liked this one the best.  It's interesting to see both Muller and Pronzini write about protagonists other than their famous ones (Sharon McCone and Nameless, respectively).  Muller also authored the Joanna Stark trilogy about an art security expert.  The Elena Oliverez series is heavily into the world of Hispanic art but is highly dosed with the personalities of its highly divergent characters--highlighting human foibles.  It is not a continuing saga like the Stark trilogy, but is connected in time and in the characters involved.  Interestingly, Muller gives Elena a cameo appearance in her latest Sharon McCone adventure: \\"The Dangerous Hour.\\"  I find both Elena and Quincannon appealing.  I consider this one of her best works--I liked this book very much, and it's worth reading the entire trilogy.  I am not as familiar with Pronzini's works, however, the two have collaborated on several novels so far \\"Duo\\" and \\"Double\\" as well as editing numerous themed short story collections together (e.g. \\"Child's Play,\\" \\"Kill or Cure,\\" \\"The Wickedist Show on Earth,\\" and the western story collection, \\"She Won the West\\").  In other of the novels written together, sections describing each character's actions flip flop between the two authors.  However, in prior efforts, they employed McCone and Nameless; here each uses a different protagonist.  Also, in this book there is a major time lapse between the eras of the two characters making this an unusual and especially intriguing work.

This ancient text is the ultimate text on the latter.  The US Army has mostly used attrition warfare.  That means you throw more soldiers and weapons at the enemy than the enemy can handle.  General Grant and WW II are cases in point.  On the other hand the US Marine Corps is well-known for it use of relational-maneuver warfare such as Inchon in the Korean War.  In relational-maneuver warfare, one can have lesser forces and still heavily damage the enemy or even win.  As Clauswitz called it--one attacks the enemy's center of gravity or attacks the enemy with more/better forces at isolated points (e.g. the Finns vs. the Germans in WWII).  One of the beauties of this approach is that there are far less casualties.  In Desert Storm, the Iraqi communications were taken out early--an attack on a center of gravity for command and control.  The principles in Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\" are transferable to any conflict situation as a general case because they are so high level in nature.  They can be applied to football, business negotiations, etc.  Unlike some, Sun Tzu recognized that winning a war is not a matter of killing all the enemy; it's a matter of imposing a nation's political will upon another.  From a certain perspective, he appears to be a realist, militarist, and humanist (he tries to minimize casualties) combined.	2004-10-03

However, he is far more famous for his compendium of Jewish Law (Halakhah) entitled the Shulkhan Arukh).  Indeed, it became (and still is) the ultimate book of traditional Jewish law--more than Maimonides' books!  It seems amazing that the author of such an outstanding and orthodox work could not only be a Kabbalistic mystic, but also write a book about his Maggid.  Sometimes (as in the Maggid of Mezerich), a Maggid is a preacher (usually itinerant).  But, in this case, the Maggid is a spiritual on non-material being who instructs a person (you can interpret it as a spirit guide or angel or whatever).  In this instance, even more interesting than that, Karo's Maggid is considered the essence or embodiment of the Mishnah (the Oral Torah or law later included in the Talmud which is, essentially, a commentary on the Mishnah).  I think Jung would probably take a symbolic or archetypal view of this, and one could argue that it was really an aspect of Karo's psyche--but, who knows?  It's not that easy to read this book, and the information in it is not all that wonderful or earthshaking, IMHO.  But, it is, nevertheless, a major contribution to the literature of Kabbalah in English.  It might be interesting to compare it to the works of Stewart Edward White (e.g. \\"The Unobstructed Universe\\").	2004-10-02

Not so with this book.  Rather than the more passive approaches of a number of therapeutic processes and theories, the approach here is to courageously confront the person's ego defenses.  Obviously, this is not for the faint of heart.  The author provides extensive examples of his approach.  Some of these could be used on oneself, but it may be difficult to retain objectivity.  I do think he goes overboard (as do many, many others) with the defense called Denial.  It can be a copout for anything that doesn't agree with the therapist's preconceptions.  And, the therapist CAN be wrong!  And, the therapist has his/her own defenses as well.  Nonetheless, this book is a wonderful contribution to the genre and gives hope (and a practical, speedy approach) to many people who haven't the time, money, etc.  to stay in therapy for decades.

I don't think, as one reviewer stated that there is a wide diversity of reviews at all.  Rather, the set of reviews is basically a polarity.  There are the fundamentalist/literalists/religionistic reviewers who hate this book because it contradicts many of their cherished beliefs vs. the new age types who like it very much in general.  I am surprised though that there were at least two reviewers who never even read the book!  I don't know if the author expects the reader to believe that the automatic writing or whatever came from God or not.  That view is incredibly naive.  I do NOT deny that God speaks to people (study mysticism--God speaks to tons of people: perhaps to all people) but most people don't listen.  That said, just because you get a message doesn't mean you know who the sender is--it's like getting an e-mail (or an Amazon review).  It takes judgment to have any assurance of the source.  Psychic research frequently has this problem.  Was the result (assuming it was successful) stem from telepathy?  from clairvoyance?  etc.  It's not easy to tell.  In science, when choosing from amongst a set of possible alternative explanations of the data, one uses Occam's Razor.  This principle states that after you eliminate the alternatives that do not fit the data, you choose the simplest one left.  Having studied psychology as well as psychic phenomena, I'd suggest that the information came to the author from his own psyche.  There is some wisdom in this book.  It's no way in the world the best book I've ever read (try the Upanishads or the Kybalion or many, many others).  Also, while they may NEED to believe literally in their own scriptures, it's really a stretch to give much credence to people who don't see that the majority of the world doesn't agree with them or who have never objectively explored other religions (especially ones very different from their own.  Hinduism (and I'm not a Hindu) presents a wonderful Model of religion in its yoga system.  This includes Bhakti Yoga (the yoga of love and devotion--reminds one of the precepts of Christianity), Karma Yoga (the yoga of acting in a holy or God-inspired manner--as with some Medieval monks or the Zen carrying water and chopping wood), Raja Yoga (the yoga of psychic exercises--the Tibetan Buddhists' channels/bindu/prana or Practical or Ecstatic Kabbalah), and Jnana Yoga (the yoga of wisdom--Tibetan Dzogchen or Mahamudra or Esoteric Kabbalah).  Hatha Yoga only addresses the body--not enlightenment.  Most religions tend to concentrate on certain yogas.  I would suggest you study other religions (including from a different hemisphere) that focus on a different yoga than your own.  It would be quite enlightening.  But, of course, to acknowledge the legitimacy of other religious views is beyond many folks.

At least he isn't claiming it's from God like Neale Walsch!  My review of Walsch's \\"Conversations with God\\" are appropos here as well.  BUT...the words of this book resonate far better.  Furthermore, White followed it up with one of the great classics of metaphysics, \\"The Unobstructed Universe.\\"  The \\"Betty Book\\" is a fine (almost necessary) introduction to \\"The Unobstructed Universe.\\"  The world view presented in these works (wherever they actually came from) is profound, logical, and fills in many a void in other metaphysical systems.  So, if you are turned off by the stated source, just ignore it and read on.  Frankly, almost all the books I read are replete with the author's personality, predispositions, assumptions, etc.--it's hard to read between the lines and to separate the wheat from the chaff.  In this book, however, that only applies to the source.  The material (and, especially in the following volume) is first rate.  White also wrote 5 or 6 additional spiritual works which are lesser lights but worth reading.  Be aware, however, that he was a professional writer of Westerns.  The other spiritual books of his I've read are: \\"Anchors to Windward,\\" \\"The Job of Living,\\" \\"The Road I Know,\\" \\"The Stars Are Still There,\\" and \\"With Folded Wings.\\"	2004-10-02

But it's mostly an apologetic for Mahayana vs. Theravada Buddhism.  Though it does indicate that a layman can spiritually reach higher than monks.  While compassion is very appealing this book is unconvincing that Mahayanists have higher enlightenment than Theravadists.  True, this book does have the \\"koan\\" in which the protagonist is speechless to demonstrate a lack of duality.  But, it was disappointing as a whole.  Per David Snellgrove: \\"The fault in this plot is that it makes us expect too much from Vimalakirti's argumentative power.  Modern novelists make the same mistake...the actual quality of his discourse is not good enough.  We are left wondering why all the Saints stood in such awe of him.  The author of this sutra tries to make up for this defect by a series of flighty miraculous episodes, which serve only to enhance the general effect of triviality.\\"  p. 272 in Edward Conze, I. B.

He was a writer of western fiction and published many novels.  He also published at least 7 spiritual works based upon input from Betty (according to the books).  The initial book is quite good--\\"The Betty Book\\" and highly recommended reading whether you accept the premise of its origin or not.  The following work is a great classic of metaphysics--\\"The Unobstructed Universe.\\"  The later volumes are based upon its cogent, logical, and convincing world view and are attempts, perhaps, to lead readers in applying resulting conclusions.  Thus, this book has some wisdom, but it's not as pithy as the former two classic works.  Other, similar spiritual works include: \\"The Job of Living,\\" \\"Anchors to Windward,\\" \\"The Road I Know,\\" and \\"With Folded Wings.\\"  I value White's spiritual works far more than the Seth books or Walsch's \\"Conversations with God\\" series.	2004-10-02

I've read John Gray, Deborah Tannen, Carl Jung, etc. on gender and other human differences, but this approach was unexpected.  I believe that some differences between the sexes are actually between Thinkers and Feelers (most men are T's and most women are F's) and that people confuse the preference differences for gender differences (traits).  I still do.  But, this book adds another dimension to the fray--brain biology.  It does fill in many gaps in understanding gender-related differences, especially the apparent anomalies left by the psychological theories of gender differences.  Interestingly, I am now listening to the audio tapes of the 28 Oct. 1993 Jung Institute of Chicago Conference on Gender.  Tape #527 is a talk entitled, \\"Moving Forward Into the Past: The Dissolution of Traditional Gender Constructions\\" by Helen Fisher.  Ms. Fisher is a Cultural Anthropologist, not a Jungian or a psychologist.  The thrust of her lecture was that much of the changes we are seeing in present American society regarding gender are merely a return to prior modes of living (in relation to gender roles) that were upset when the plow was invented and humans moved out of the hunter-gatherer gender-related roles.  I think that one might consider all of these perspectives (psychological, biological, anthropological, etc.) before reaching any definitive conclusions about gender differences.  Further, statistics are extraordinarily important in evaluating differences (i.e. translating information into knowledge).  \\"Brain Sex\\" provides a fascinating, though somewhat shocking additional and valuable piece to this complex puzzle.	2004-10-01

The first is an overview entitled: \\"King, Warrior, Magician, Lover.\\"  They followed up this fine introductory work with a book on each of the 4 archetypes.  This one is, of course, on the King Archetype.  Each of the 4 books has a completely redundant section (worth reading once, anyway), but also has much material on the particular, titled, archetype.  The names of the archetypes are defined a bit differently than society might define them--moving the descriptions into the worlds of psychology and mythology which the two authors are well-versed in.  If you read one, you \\"should\\" (I dislike that word, but what can you do?) read all of them.  Otherwise, you get a skewed view of the archetypes, the authors' works, and the theory they propose.  I like \\"The King Within\\" very much.  It provides not only description of the archetype but some ramifications and ideas as to how to implement or invoke it.  I found the book uplifting and see the glass as half full.  The authors provided the rationale and some means of implementation of the Mens' Movement.

It's not about strategy.  Strategy is very high level (there are three levels of warfare: strategic, operational, and tactical).  This book is about tactics.  Strategy is how to win a potential war from a national level; operational refers to how an area commander (e.g. General Schwartzkoff) fights a theater; tactics is how you take a hill or defend your ship.  I've got tons of experience in program management, have published articles on management, have scientific degrees and an MBA, and I fail to see how this is a management book.  It seems like a HUGE stretch to me.  The rating, unfortunately, seems to depend on what one expects from the book.  I expected something that would be strategically useful (or at least operationally) from a management perspective.  Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\" (one of my favorite books and far better, I think, than von Clauswitz) certainly qualifies.  This book does not.  However, I just read John Suler's \\"Contemporary Psychoanalysis & Eastern Thought\\" in which he explains how the martial arts (referencing this book & others) relates to psychology & spiritual development.  Thus, I must positively revise my view of this book.	2004-10-01

I just started \\"The Wisdom of No Escape\\" which I expect will be up to her high standards.  Her books are short, but my criticism of many other writers on Vajrayana (and other topics as well) has been about how verbose they are--that the meaning could easily be condensed 10-fold or more.  Not so with Pema Chodron's works.  She leaves you wanting more.  How about a few more books, Pema?	2004-10-01

It's one of my favorite books of all time--a keeper: I usually give away books after I've read them.  It's not for everyone though.  It is very high philosophy--the top of the mountain, not partway up (though there is some variation among the various Upanishads--they are not entirely consistent in level of abstraction).  This is great for Myers-Briggs iNtuitives; not so hot for Sensates.  And, of course, one needs to step out of his/her own religious upbringing if not a Hindu.  It may seem very different from other religious views, but in point of fact, the Brahman (not to be confused with the Hindu Brahma, creator god) is pretty much the same as the Tibetan (both Buddhist and Bon) Dharmakaya or Ground of Being (a la Dzogchen and Mahamudra) or the Jewish Kabbalah's Ein Sof.  It's amazing how the highest, esoteric views (Truth's if you will) are consistent across humanity.  This is a book of vision, not dogma.	2004-10-01

Pema Chodron's style typifies such a friend.  Of course, a Buddha is supposed to have the rare ability to perceive what another person needs (vs. wants).  A guru is supposed to try and do that.  In a book, it's impossible to personalize the instruction.  (Though you could get her wonderful 6-cassette set, \\"Awakening Compassion\\" which covers much of the same material = Lojong mind training). Nevertheless, her writing style makes it easy to read her books and her empathy seems to me to shine through her writing so that one can more easily adjust ones perspective to attune to the book and the point she is making.  In this particular book she addresses the Lojong mind training she received from Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, her Guru.  It includes many very helpful and useful precepts.

My favorite is \\"A Bed by the Window.\\"  It's certainly less popular than \\"The Road Less Traveled.\\" However, it may just be his most important work.  He courageously invades \\"forbidden territory\\" by assaying into the realm of evil.  Despite what some of the prior reviewers have asserted, Dr. Victor White upheld (what he indicated was the official Catholic position of the \\"provatio boni\\" that evil is merely the absence of good.  C. G. Jung took issue with that, indicating that there was real evil in the world, not just the absence of good.  Their long-term warm friendship ended over this issue (see C. G. Jung's Letters (ed. Gerhard Adler in 2 volumes).  Peck argues this perspective.  I didn't get the \\"Christian\\" bias that some reviewers complained about.  But then, people write (and speak) from their own value systems, views, etc.--which frequently are more the message than the message itself.  I saw herein the message itself.  On an absolute level of abstraction, one could argue that all comes from the same source (all the Western and many of the Eastern religions would actually agree on this if it were described correctly to them).  At a relative level, however, IMHO evil is what happens that you just hate--and don't feel responsible for.  I think Dr. Peck has done us a great service though it could be argued that he's opened Pandora's Box.  It's kind of like eating the apple: you get kicked out of Paradise, but you actually get a life.  Seems worth it to me.	2004-10-01

It doesn't fully describe what a Zaddik is or does, but it does provide some high-level examples.  Strangely, R. Yaakov Yosef's definition closely matches the Mahayana Buddhist idea of the Bodhisattva who, while having enlightenment in sight personally, returns to the mundane world in order to help others and assist in raising them up from the muck.  The dangers described herein also match.  This is reminiscent of Shimon Halevi's comment about contemporary folks leaving Western religions and going East to look for spirituality when it already exists in the West.  Here's a case in point.  The author, rightly, describes the problem that the early Hasids had regarding the Sabbatean heresy (in which a self-styled messiah converted to Islam under pain of death) and the more (to him) contemporary parallel of Jacob Frank (who brought his followers into Christianity).  Both of them used the precept of the leader lowering himself down to a low level in order to raise the people of that level to greater heights.  They obviously took this to a great extreme (especially from a Jewish, not to mention Orthodox, perspective).  Nonetheless, this is a scholarly work (also read expensive); it has lots of endnotes (mostly in Hebrew--and I like to read the endnotes in books).  It also has a 3-page Conclusion at the end of the text.  If you can find this book in the library (or borrow it), you can just read the Conclusion.  It's a concise, cogent summary of the book.  Well worth the read.  Better than Cliff Notes!	2004-10-01

They concisely describe these archetypes and provide some arguments for their theory and some applications of their findings.  Moore is a Jungian psychologist and Gillette is a mythologist.  It's an interesting and fertile collaboration of specialties.  But, they simply cannot do justice to the 4 archetypes in one, tiny, volume.  Thus, they wrote and published a volume on each of the 4 archetypes (5 books in all).  Therefore, I'd consider this an introductory volume or prequel (a bit like the Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings trilogy).  It's good in its own right, but better viewed as part of a much larger work.  This larger work rates at least 5 stars.  By the way, Dr. Moore has also produced numerous audio tapes for the C. G.

Doesn't seem so.  This is a classic work (maybe the prior version was?).  It delineates a theory (and fully supports it with examples etc.) that traits are passed on from generation to generation via learning (as opposed to biology/genetics).  For example, a child learns what it MEANS to be a father or mother from watching how her or his father and mother act.  Thus, history repeats itself over generations--unless one recognizes the problem (1/2 the solution) and does something about it.  It's a short book (thank goodness because it just doesn't take that much space to put down such a thesis).

For an example of a book with a potent ritual that also provides considerable explanation of the process/meaning, see Palden Sherab Rinpoche's \\"The Practice of Vajrakilaya.\\"  My main point of reading these books is to DO it, not just read about it.  So I value succinctness and thoughtful explication.  Tsultrim Allione, a Western Buddhist nun, has created a cassette tape entitled, \\"Feeding the Demons: Relaxing Dualism\\" which succinctly describes Chod.  I strongly recommend it.  Lama Zopa published a short pamphlet, \\"Chod: Cutting Off the Truly Existing I\\" as well. I've now read Jerome Edou's book (Machig Labdron and the Foundations of Chod) which is wonderful--I highly recommend it.  I have also discovered recently that Chod can be combined with or integrated with Tonglen (Giving & Receiving) creating a very powerful technique indeed.	2004-09-30

Scholem's approach to Kabbalah and M. Idel's approach while recognizing the differing scholarly climate in which each operated. But, I think there is one more important difference. By restricting \\"Kabbalah\\" to the Middle Ages (though he certainly knew of the prior Jewish mystical literature, e.g. Sefer Yetzirah, Heikalot & Shiur Koma, Biblical Chariot, etc.) he failed to recognize an historical, mystical thread in Judaism. He also failed to adequately recognize (discernable, for example, in many other religions) a history of oral tradition (despite the existence of the Mishnah!) in Jewish mysticism. Idel helps to rectify this tremendous oversight. Even if Idel isn't correct that a group of mystics, including de Leon, wrote the Zohar -- perhaps based on an ancient fragment, his thesis deserves to be seriously considered. As a hard scientist, I am unimpressed with Scholem's (and his followers') arguments that de Leon composed the entire work himself. But, then, I've only read it in English (Sperling et al). IMHO, Idel's book is of significant historical importance.	2004-09-30

This book is very scholarly and takes an historical perspective.  It also includes some translations of short ancient texts supporting the Dzogchen claims of antiquity and association with Tibetan Buddhism.  But it DOES have some very interesting observations.  For instance, you might accept the much repeated views of the Buddhist Kings of Tibet regarding religion as well as the claim that Buddhism is a peaceful and tolerant religion.  Not the case points out this author.  He backs up his assertions with lots of reference material too.  Apparently, for example, one of the much touted Buddhist kings fanatically persecuted the Bonpos.  I think this book is worth ploughing through to rectify some of the highly colored views one can easily reach after reading lots of Tibetan authors.  You can also read Donatella Rossi's wonderful \\"The Philosophical View of the Great Perfection in the Tibetan Bon Religion (1559391294) which is presented somewhat similarly and references this work by Karmay.	2004-09-30

This book is a case in point.  Rabbi Boteach is an Orthodox Rabbi so his views are quite traditional.  He does, however, modify them somewhat with an understanding of some of the realities of life in America.  But, by making marriage (his goal of love) a given NEED, it skews his view of dating, psychology, etc.  At first it seemed to have a feminine flavor, but I believe that it's really more of a Feeling (vs. Thinking from a Jungian perspective) view of the world.  Also a bit more Extroverted than Introverted.  Some of his pronouncements seem quite naive to me (e.g. his \\"Declaration of Dependence\\" in Chapter 8).  Nevertheless, he does provide some solid, usable advice which counters some recent practices and identifies addictive dating and its ramifications.  Also, he interjects a bit of humor and some illustrative stories as examples.  I only gave it 3 stars, but I can easily see that other people in other circumstances could give it more.  I think that those who despise this book might look within to see why that is.  You can certainly disagree with R. Boteach's perspective and values, but to overly, emotionally react to the book seems irrational to me.	2004-09-30

As a former Program Manager with degrees in hard science and an MBA, and over 35 years of work experience, I can attest that the working world frequently (in not \\"almost always\\") confuses or confounds these two.  Furthermore, I believe that different psychological types of folks (a la the Jungian Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) are generally attuned to one, the other, or neither.  It is rare to find an individual who can encompass both approaches.  Yet, knowing about their differences is the first step towards successfully integrating them.  As they say, recognizing the problem is half the solution.  I usually give away books after I read them.  Not this one.  This is a keeper!	2004-09-30

Also, found it quite helpful -- since I know a Narcissist personally.  But, I didn't realize that he had a clinical condition prior to reading this book.  It fit him like a glove!!!  I don't find Dr. Lowen's Freudian orientation objectionable--that's his perspective.  Yes, it would have been nice if he had delineated alternate (non-Freudian) theories too, but it isn't required.  After all, he probably doesn't agree with them.  Unlike some of the reviewers, I don't think Freudian theory has been utterly displaced in psychology.  I think there's room for lots of approaches and that if psychologists and therapists took a more eclectic view, they'd be far more successful in treating their clients/patients.  By the way, while I did study Freud (and others) in colleges, I'm basically a Jungian layman--not a Freudian.	2004-09-30

Thrangu Rinpoche writes in a comprehensive & highly readable style.  He does utilize typical Vajrayana mythology without reservation here--though in his wonderful \\"Medicine Buddha Teachings\\" he provides explanation and reality-based descriptions.  Also, I don't think the Madhyamaka argument is scientifically conclusive.  However, I have recently read \\"Mind at Ease\\" by Traleg Kyabgon which did put my mind at ease on most of these points.  And, after all, Thrangu Rinpoche is commenting on a much older text.  He's also published 3 books on the 9th Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive (or Ultimate) Meaning as well.  Much of the material in this volume is covered in these other texts on Mahamudra (e.g. Shamatha, Vipashyana, Bodhichitta).  However, chapters 15 (\\"The Practice of Utterly Releasing\\") and 16 (\\"Bringing Obstacles to the Path\\") of this book add new (to me) refreshing and very helpful material--further elucidating similarities to Dzogchen.  Thus, despite having read many other Mahamudra texts, this book had a definite, useful value to me.  Nevertheless, having now read the full translation (mentioned above), a monumental work, this commentary seems a bit sparse especially regarding the enlightening descriptions and advice to meditators in the last few chapters of the root text.	2004-09-29

Not only that, but the title is Safed \\"Spirituality.\\"  The two topics picked are barely (if at all) spiritual.  Admittedly, Kabbalistic mystics have written much of the Musar (Jewish ethical/moral literature)--Cordovero wrote \\"The Palm Tree of Deborah;\\" Luzzatto wrote \\"The Path of the Just,\\" \\"The Way of God,\\" and \\"The Knowing Heart;\\" etc.  But that doesn't make them \\"spiritual\\" works.  Perhaps, my definition differs from his?  Still, I would think that Idel's \\"Kabbalah: New Perspectives\\" or Gikatilla's \\"Gates of Light\\" or Aryeh Kaplan's \\"Jewish Meditation,\\" \\"Meditation and the Bible,\\" and \\"Meditation and Kabbalah\\" would qualify as spiritual texts or at least as addressing spiritual topics.  The present text does not do so.  I do think that translating and publishing de Vidas classic Musar work is a valuable contribution to the scholarly literature, but I don't think this book will help to make Safed a household word.  And, if it did, it would have the wrong flavor anyway.  16th Century Safed was perhaps the most fertile time/place for Jewish mystical and spiritual development ever (with the possible exception of the Baal Shem Tov's Hasidism).  Unfortunately, this does not come across in this book.  Hopefully, the author will follow up this text with a sequel that addresses the more spiritual aspects and innovations that began in Safed. As it is, the subtitle is far more accurate than the title which seems a bit misleading to me.	2004-09-29

There are tons of divergent reviews (below) of this book.  People tend to rate a book in terms of their expectations and their expectations reflect their individual value systems and psychology.  This makes is difficult to analyze the analyses!  As for me, I got this book free by attending a Knowledge Management Institute conference.  Mr. Gladwell was a terrific speaker!!!  As a major proponent of Knowledge Management (which includes Social Network Analysis), I was delighted with both the talk and the book (which I later read).  It is NOT a highly and carefully documented scientific study of a theory (as some of the reviewers lamented).  It's also NOT a glossy magazine article of dubious technical merit.  Rather, it's a thought-provoking attempt to communicate some theories and examples of the tipping point theory.  Of course, the main idea is that the world is NOT linear.  Which, by the way, it isn't.  But, though recognizing (for example) that most groups of things in life are normally distributed (bell-shaped curve, which is non-linear), people continue to live and breath linearity.  Precious little in life is linear.  See Einstein's theory of relativity if you disagree with this.  Thus, this book is an entertaining and provocative attempt to teach non-linearity to the public--a courageous idea, IMHO.  While some can't see the forest for the bark, that's why Jung and Myers/Briggs developed Psychological Types!	2004-09-29

They are informative and valuable especially regarding what Buddhists refer to as Emptiness.  Indeed, the Tibetan Buddhists in addition to various Vajrayana texts, often cite and recommend the Prajnaparamita literature which is vast.  This literature includes the famous Heart Sutra (which is actually about one page long!).  I gave this particular book 4 stars because I've also read the intermediate length version (8000 lines) which is far better.  I own (but haven't read yet) the large version (I think its 25,000 lines).  There are even larger ones that Dr. Conze hasn't done too.  Nevertheless, it might be best to read the short ones first to get a taste for the literature and then move on to the 8000 lines version (probably the one most referenced other than, perhaps, the Heart Sutra itself).  Good reading!	2004-09-29

It also brings General Semantics into the mainstream in a useful, logical manner vs. some of the more technical GS literature which seems questionable from a scientific perspective.  True, the author is a strong proponent of psychic phenomena.  But, a true scientist keeps an open mind and the literature is growing and convincing in these areas.  For example, the illustrious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) did a rigorous study on telepathy and published the sender's randomly selected photographs right next to the receiver's hand drawn responses.  The results were VERY convincing.  But, ESP is NOT the main thrust of this book.  Rather, it is an attempt to integrate and extend intuitive reasoning minds through the past and into the near future.  I'm impressed.	2004-09-29

Probably shouldn't be though.  It's difficult to step outside of yourself and look at something objectively.  Generally, a person's response to something has more to do with the state or psychology or situation of the person at the time than with the stimulus eliciting the response.  This is a case in point--especially for those who reviewed this book more than once!  But it's very much to the point of the book itself.  It's saying to step outside yourself.  How can you effectively deal with life (on a long-term basis rather than fighting fires all the time) if you cannot take the high ground and view your situation form outside?  Pema Chodron provides both a perspective and considerable methods to do just that -- under trying circumstances.  I've read 3 of her books and just got the 4th (from Amazon) today.  I expect I'll enjoy it tremendously.	2004-09-28

The root text is beautiful and, if one has had prior Mahamudra teachings, very concise and to the point.  The commentary is generally vague and the supporting quotations less than enlightening--frequently more of an apologetic than a commentary.

Towards the end of the book, the author provides a step-by-step experiential guide to Trekcho practice with pitfalls, recommendations, etc.  The wording is personal, straight-forward, and very clear.  He also has a very interesting description of the sky exercise.  Thus, I do recommend reading (preferably buying and retaining for reference) this book.

It contains precious little Dzogchen--barely mentions Trekcho or Togal (primary Dzogchen processes).  It doesn't even include some of the best approaches to Shamatha or any real exposition of Vipashyana (see Thrangu Rinpoche's other books for this).  It also ignores Tonglen and Chod (excellent Vajrayana techniques, though not themselves Dzogchen either).  Primarily it seems to be an apologetic for culturally specific Tibetan practices such as 100's of thousands of prostrations (I'd rather do Chod).  It fails even as a primer.  It is difficult to find a single book with the breadth and depth of Dzogchen (but, try The Practice of Dzogchen by Tulku Thondup).  I think this book is misleading and of marginal value.	2004-09-20

This is NOT one of them.  There are also pure scholarly works with a small, fervent readership.  This isn't one of those either, though scholars may certainly find it very valuable.  The commentator/translator excerpts from many of Longchenpa's (Longchen Rabjam's) various texts which would be virtually impossible to access in English otherwise.  Longchenpa is one of, if not THE, greatest Dzogchen masters of all time.  Nevertheless, this is not an easy text to read.  Furthermore,  it is inconsistent in depth & style.  However, this is a definitive Dzogchen text--quite advanced, not for the beginner, challenging, and enlightening.  It grows with you and re-reading texts in an unfamiliar area can increase understanding and familiarity (the way Jung studied Alchemy).  This is a GREAT book, not to be underrated, but not every book is for every one.  There is also a new issue of the same text entitled \\"Buddha Mind.\\"  It might be better to read Longchenpa's \\"Kindly Bent to Ease Us\\" trilogy before attempting this one.

This is a more advanced text than most others I've read.  It skips most of the preliminaries, gets to the point, and is well-written.  I found Chapter 13 particularly valuable.  The author presents explanations and perspectives with enough difference from other authors as to add to one's understanding from a wider or broader view.  He also answers some questions I have not seen addressed adequately elsewhere.  Normally, I read a book and give it away--for others to use.  Sometimes, I keep it as a \\"loaner\\" or reference.  I plan to keep this one for a while.  It rates better than 4 stars, but I reserve the 5 rating for books that are incomparably good (and in order to preserve the dynamic range).  Read some other Mahamudra books first (e.g. Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche's books) and some Dzogchen too.  Then read this one.  It's worth owning.
