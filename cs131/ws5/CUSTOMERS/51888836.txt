I am hooked! <br /> <br />Quick recap: <br />Book One introduced Jack Frake living on the fringes of a tyrannical society and family.  He overcomes the petty evil of his family to find himself facing the equally evil and tyrannical government that ends up unjustly trying and hanging his friends and mentors. <br /> <br />In Book Two we meet Hugh Kenrick, born into a life of privilege, he nonetheless develops into a self-made person far exceeding the deeds and honor of his ancestors and peers.   <br /> <br />In Book Three tensions are created and developed.  Hugh Kenrick is now a man.  He is moving to Caxton to buy a tobacco farm and to learn how to be master of his own property.  One of his neighbors is Jack Frake.  It quickly becomes obvious that the two men are cut from the same cloth even though Hugh is an aristocrat and Jack was formerly an indentured servant.  They meet in America as equals.  One of the fascinating and satisfying aspects of Book Three is to watch the relationship between Jack and Hugh develop.  There is no petty jealousies between them even though they vie for the affections of the same woman.  Between England and the colonies the tension increases as the inevitable clash of philosophies nears.  Will the crown hear the cries of its suffering colonies?   <br /> <br />The portrayal of Man the hero continues to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of this series.  Though the primary characters are fictional they are a true representation of the kind of intellectual and moral giants that existed during the gestation and birth of the greatest country in the history of the world.  <br />	2004-12-07

Bristling with the kind of detail and \\"shine on the button\\" facts that bring historical fiction to life but accomplished without any bogging down in irrelevancies.  In truth, the strength of this work is not the flawless and informative settings or Ed's unerring ability to transport the reader to another time and place, but the depth and attractiveness of his characterizations. <br /> <br />This is a superb demonstration of the kind of work destined to revive and continue the spirit that made America great and a continuation of a new renaissance in Romanticism as envisioned by Ayn Rand.  <br /> <br />Thanks Ed Cline for the incredible pleasure and inspiration your novels deliver. <br />	2004-10-28

I have read many, many books on Columbus but none that penetrate to the deeper meaning of what he accomplished than this book by Mr. Bowden.  <br />It is at once a defense against the current crop of history revisionists and multi-culturalists who would like nothing more than to have the public believe that western civilization is no better than the tribal savages that existed in the Americas prior to Columbus' arrival here.<br />Bowden shows due respect to the heroism of Columbus while providing an abundance of fodder to combat the mocking birds of political correctness infesting our universities.<br />A must read!	2003-12-11

Normally I don't even bother to review books I don't like, but I really wanted to enjoy this book and was disappointed.  Having recently read Edward Cline's &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot; books I have become more interested in the early days of American history, so when I read the back cover of this book I got my hopes up for some good reading and some historical information... I ended up with neither one.<br />This is a rather dull, slow-moving mystery starting with a ghastly whipping scene.  The characters never get developed to the point where the reader can actually care about them and there are some characters who play pivital roles who aren't developed at all... they just kind of pop in and out of the story as needed.  I found it a bit confusing.<br />As an additional note the author seems to think naturalism is the same as historical fiction.  It is not.	2003-11-08

In 1967 an accidental missile firing on the flight deck of the USS Forrestal struck John McCain's plane, starting a series of events that ended in the deaths of more than a hundred brave sailors.<br />What really stood out for me in this story is the heroism of ordinary guys risking their lives to save the ship, themselves and their shipmates.<br />WARNING: There are really gory descriptions of some of the casualties so be prepared to be shocked.	2003-08-03

Edward Cline has set down an easy to read, fast-paced glimpse into the everyday Objectivist's world at a ground-level view.  This is not epic fiction where the fate of the world hangs on the choices of the character's decisions, but certainly it is a fine example of how people are the product of their philosophies... or lack thereof.  And it's refreshing in that the ability of the main character to solve the mystery he is confronted with depends entirely upon his commitmant to his own values.<br />I think one of the more enjoyable things about this story is seeing a man of principle confront each step of the mystery with rationality and determination to learn the truth... wherever it may lead.<br />Kudos Mr. Cline!	2003-04-30

I just returned from Paris where I visited the Opera house in which the Phantom of the Opera story is set.  I also re-read the novel as a precursor to my visit.  The main thing I can tell you about this story is that, to me, the Opera house itself is the main attraction of this story.  The story itself is not all that great, although interesting and fairly original in its execution.<br />As I wandered the labyrinthian halls of the Opera I definitely benefitted by having re-read the book, since it gave me all kinds of secret fantasies about the building and secret passageways.  If you get the chance to go to Paris you must see this building!!!  Next time I think I'll bring my copy of the book along and sit in a quiet corner of the Opera house and read!	2002-12-05

If you know have ever read a book by R.B. Parker you will find yourself in a familiar environment in this book.  Parker sets himself a brave task in writing a sequel to Raymond Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep\\" and succeeds in pulling it off superbly.  Parker is one of the rare modern writers who still believe that characters can have principles, and live by them even in extreme circumstances.  Although this is not Parker's best work, I still recommend this book in which, in my opinion, Parker surpasses one of the legends of detective fition, Raymond Chandler.	2002-07-24

But, it's not so much about the war as it is about the inevitability of change.  The author tries to present the so-called tragedies of industrialization injected into an idyllic environment of stagnant (though supposedly blissful) island culture.   Although I did enjoy this book, especially the can-do attitude of the American Army and Navy engineers, the obvious dichotomy between the American sense of life and the anti-technology philosophy that plagues the main character is disappointing.	2002-07-24

It's difficult to find a character in contemporary fiction who succeeds so well at living up to his principles with hardly a blink of his figurative eye.  In \\"Forfeit\\" there is such a character.  Confronted with a choice between selling out his integrity and facing hardship, journalist, James Tyrone invariably chooses the hardship and immediately applies his mental resources to overcome the threat.

The primary reason I continue to seek out and read Dick Francis is that he continually creates heroes that are efficacious and rational. He avoids the common pitfalls of most modern writers, and instead invents characters who pass the ultimate test: \\"Would I like to meet and know this person?\\" If you can answer \\"yes\\" to that question then there is great potential for enjoyment in the fiction centered around that character. If you answer \\"no\\" to that question, why even bother reading further?<br />In Second Wind the master of galloping fiction spins an interesting story with more twists than a hurricane.

The answer to the question is Parker's sense of wit and his positive outlook.  Breezing through this book while trapped on a 9-hour trans-Atlantic flight from Hell, I was reminded of why Spenser has been so successful as a character -- he uses intelligence and principles to solve crimes and to live his life. There is no wallowing in self doubt after Spenser shoots a 2-bit hood who tries to kill him.  Spenser is a true heroic man that anyone would love to have as a friend and hate to have as an enemy.<br />Just another great read from Parker.	2002-06-06

This book is a very quick read, but what it lacks in bulk it makes up for in well-aimed criticisms of Network News.<br />Goldberg points out many examples of how the networks consistantly intrude liberal views into their nightly programs.  His style is easy to read although at times he uses humor in a somewhat distracting way.  A more straightforward presentation would have been a bit more effective.  With that said, Goldberg does make an excellent case and is dead-on when it comes to his assessment that networks refuse to \\"connect the dots\\" when they think it might portray their own liberal views in a bad light.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a behind the scenes look at the network news industry and what drives it.	2002-05-19

It's the first time I've heard anyone take such a principled approach to understanding the true causes of why blacks perform so far below the average in education.  McWhorter identifies the cause as a cultural disconnection with intellectual pursuits within the black community.  He takes it a step further and gives numerous examples and first hand accounts of how it happens from childhood on in the black community.<br />It's rare to find a piece of non-fiction that grips you and then does such a complete job of educating you on an issue.  This book does that.	2002-05-19

In The Fountainhead her theme is the role of an independant mind in shaping one's life as opposed to living as a second-hander who conforms to the mob and acts selflessly.  Through the progression of the hero's career, Rand demonstrates the practicallity of principled action based on self-interest.  It is amazing how simple this idea is yet even more amazing how few people have fully appreciated its power.<br />If you have never read Rand, this is a good book to start with.  take your time and enjoy it, and when you are done get Atlas Shrugged as soon as you can.

Ayn Rand said that \\"We the Living\\" was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Maybe that's why when I was reading WTL I got the impression that I was witnessing real scenes from Ayn's past life under the Soviet system.  The uncompromising and highly principled behavior of the main character, Kira is inspiring and horrible to witness when you realize what she was up against(communist rule).<br />Kira is not the superhero type Rand would create so well in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, but she was as close as you could expect to find in Soviet Russia.  And unlike Rand's later fiction, WTL has a sad ending... an ending which really drives home the point of how collectivism's ultimate result is death -- death of the mind, death of the individual, and eventually death of everything good in society.<br />It kept me up nights reading and many more nights pondering what it all meant.

There are people speaking out in virtually every major newspaper, there are radio shows on the air every day bringing the voice of reason to their listeners, there have been leading Objectivist intellectuals on popular TV shows, there are even several major universities now starting philosophy programs to study Objectivism, and the internet has hundreds if not thousands of websites dedicated to Ayn Rand and her ideas.  The media department at the Ayn Rand Institute.  is being consulted more and more often by news outlets that wouldn't even have given Rand a second thought 10 years ago.<br />No, Atlas does not need to shrug... the burden of bad ideas is growing smaller and smaller every day thanks to the ground-breaking philosophy in Ayn Rands novel \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"	2002-03-06

In yet another gripping story of mystery, murder and British steeplechasing, Dick Francis continues his amazing streak of hit novels.<br />His real appeal is not racing or mystery however, it is his ability to create characters who are admirable, honorable and self-reliant.  If you're looking for troubled, self-loathers who \\"somehow\\" overcome their weakness and become unwilling and unwitting heroes, don't look here.  Francis' heroes revel in their abilities to withstand evil, overcome it, and end up smiling in spite of it all.<br />Kudos once again for Dick Francis and Dead Cert!	2002-02-13

The primary reason I continue to seek out and read Dick Francis is that he continually creates heroes that are efficacious and rational.  He avoids the common pitfalls of most modern writers, and instead invents characters who pass the ultimate test: &quot;Would I like to meet and know this person?&quot;  If you can answer &quot;yes&quot; to that question then there is great potential for enjoyment in the fiction centered around that character.  If you answer &quot;no&quot; to that question, why even bother reading further?<br />Dick Francis' characters almost always recieve an unreserved &quot;YES!&quot;   Read &quot;Enquiry,&quot; it's not the best from Francis but it's still furlongs beyond the rest.	2001-03-24

This is the formal version of Ayn Rand's philosophy, Objectivism. Dr. Peikoff puts it all on the table in a way that is easy to understand.  This is not light reading!!! But, reading it has helped me to more fully understand the novels and philosophy of Ayn Rand.<br />When I went back and read Atlas Shrugged again it was like opening up a whole other dimension in the prose.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-03-30

From brash, swashbuckling bravado to whispered lines of intense emotion that even Roxanne could not resist, here you will find, continued, the soul of Cyrano de Bergerac as made famous by Edmond Rostand in his legendary  play. Mr. Carcioppolo seems to have inked his pen with the very blood of  Cyrano and brought to life a new depth of character that had been, until  now, unimagined. I find myself picking up this book again and again to  refresh my memory of a favorite line or stanza. This book is destined to  become a classic! Enjoy it, and, as Cyrano would say, &quot;Songes a  librement vivre!&quot;	2000-03-30

This book is a fascinating portrait of Ayn Rand.  It shows in engrossing detail the depth of her thinking and brilliance of her philosophy, Objectivism.  <br />As a companion to the Oscar-nominated movie this book is a  great coffee table reminder of one of the greatest accomplishments of the  20th century; Ayn Rand's creation of a fully integrated, non-contradictory  code of morality.	2000-03-30

The beauty and simplicity she brings to the battle between the individual versus the mob had me thinking about - and then re-reading  the book over and over.  &quot;Anthem&quot; is a must read for anyone who  loves life and believes that respect for individual rights is the only way  to acchieve happiness on earth.<br />Bravo!	2000-03-30

Dr. Peikoff does what few historians do; he focuses on the essentials and presents them in a readable fashion. This may seem like common sense but so many historians of WWII provide a chronology or a journalistic perspective without providing insight into the causes of the war. <br />I enjoyed this book tremendously, not just because it gave me a deeper understanding of the Nazi phenomenon and its underlying philosophy, but because it was a pleasure to see History treated as a series of causes and effects instead of a jumble of concretes. <br />Read it.	2000-03-13

This was one of my favorite books as a child and it is still a thrilling read!  If you think you know the story of Tarzan but have never read the  book, do yourself a favor and read it.  There has not been a Tarzan movie  made that does the book justice.  It is really amazing how much action and  adventure is packed into this story.  And, If you really like it, there are  many more E.R. Burroughs' Tarzan books to read.	1999-10-29

It has wit, comedy, adventure, danger and intellectual swordplay.  But most importantly, it has a character(Cyrano) who values his  life and principles above all else.  Read it now!  Also, if you enjoyed  Cyrano as much as I did, check out &quot;The Lost Sonnets of Cyrano de  Bergerac&quot; by James Carcioppolo.  I read it hoping for more of Cyrano's  spirit and love of life; I was not disapointed!	1999-10-28

If you were shocked by the video of the LAPD beating Rodney King in 1991;  if you were dumbfounded by the trial that found the police officers innocent of wrongdoing;  if you cheered when Rodney King was awarded a  multimillion dollar settlement from the city of Los Angeles;  READ THIS  BOOK!  In fact, anyone interested in learning the truth about the  \\"Rodney King beating\\" should read this book.  It is an insightful exposure  of media frenzy at it's worst and clearly illustrates the fact that a  picture (in this case a video) is not an argument.	1999-10-22
