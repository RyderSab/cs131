Raymond Brown and Joseph Fitzmyer, among others, put together the premier modern Catholic biblical commentary in the late 1960s in \\"The Jerome Biblical Commentary.\\"  A little over 20 years later, they offer this updated version.  The preparation, as noted in the Foreward, involved inter-denominational studies and the volume (it is hoped) will play a part in ecumenical efforts.  This is not suprising given the late Fr. Brown's association with Union Theological Seminary and Fr. Fitzmyer's experise in Aramaic and Judaic studies.<br /><br />The commentary itself is accessible to the intelligent, theologically informed layperson.  It is of special value for clergy or academics.  My priest uses it for homiletic background research.  The commentary reflects a modern critical approach to which many traditionalists may disagree.  I find it to be sensible and conform to my understanding of the modern scientific textual approach.  And while concise, this oversized book still comes in at almost 1500 pages.  I use this commentary along with NAB Study Bible footnotes and various Anchor Bible commentaries for my personal study and Catholic work.  I contrast it with my NIV Study Bible notes and a few other commentaries for my interfaith communications.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me are the topical articles written by experts in their fields.  The articles take up the issues of Inspiration (what it is, how it has been understood, its authority and source, its history), Canonicity (an examination of the history of what is considered \\"scripture\\"), Apocrpypha and other Jewish Literature, Texts and Versions (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic targums, etc.), Modern Old Test. Criticism, Modern New Test. Criticism, Hermeneutics and so on.  Included also are articles on the History of Israel, Pauline Theology, Johannine Theology and a fascinating article on Jesus by John Meier (author of \\"A Marginal Jew\\" and other works on the historical Jesus).	2005-10-12

This version, which updates Edersheim's magnificent 19th century edition, contains color photos of some of the best researched models of the Herodian Temple at Jerusalem and is your one-stop-shopping source for information on structure, priesthood function, liturgical song and rites.  Eyewitnesses to the Temple, such as Philo and Josephus are consulted and cited.  Rabbinic material is investigated and used to support the text.<br /><br />The Temple is depicted in painstakingly detailed models and maps based on the best archaeological evidence and eyewitness reports.  Edersheim and his successors then take you through the priesthood functions as well as the rules specific to behavior in/around the Temple, and funding sources such as the various taxes and offerings.  Next the sacrifices are covered.  I found the most striking chapter for me to be \\"At Night in the Temple,\\" where Edersheim takes you on rounds with the priests and temple guard.  Everything is here, the feasts, the Passover, the Day of Atonement.<br /><br />If you're a Jew, this text will help you in your studies of pre-diaspora Jewish Temple worship.  If you're a Christian, it sheds more context on the New Testament by filling in blanks that would have made sense to 1st century Jewish Christians.  One can sense just how devastating the loss of the Temple in 70AD must have been for the religious Jews of Jerusalem.	2005-10-10

Fitzmyer, S.J.<br /><br />I've been reading his stuff for years.  Fitzmyer is scholarly, somewhat dry, and impeccably honest.  His academic credentials are first-rate.  He's one of the major contributors (in partnership with the legendary Scripture scholar Raymond E. Brown) to the New Jerusalem Biblical Commentary, as well as a number of critical commentaries in the Anchor Bible series (including the mighty tome on Paul's epistle to the Romans).<br /><br />In this collections of essays published in 2000, some reworked in a salutary fashion to meet modern standards, Fr. Fitzmyer first sets up his methodology, explaining to the reader how he comes to his conclusions from the weath of data available.  Some of the most interesting essays include \\"The Aramaic 'Son of God' Text from Qumran Cave 4\\" (in which he examines the title \\"Son of God\\" and its various flavors in this Semitic literature), the related article \\"The Background of 'Son of God' as a Title for Jesus\\" (in which Fitzmyer examines the Semitic - as opposed to Greek Septuagintal - context for \\"Son of God\\" in the New Testament in the light of the scrolls), and \\"Qumran Messianism\\" in which the often otherwise oversimplified messianic references are further explored and qualified.  I also enjoyed the \\"Tobit\\" essays inasmuch as they demonstrate the value of what many Christians and Jews consider extra-canonical literature to the keepers of the scrolls.<br /><br />In short, Fitzmyer shoots down both those who say the scrolls have nothing to do with Christianity, and those who say that figures like John the Baptist and Jesus himself show up in coded fashion in those same scrolls.  Fr. Fitzmyer also paints a context in which the Jewishness of what we Christians call the New Testament plays a fundamental role.	2005-10-10

The text is offered with the conviction that \\"understanding the religious beliefs, ethics and ritual practices of unfamiliar religions is imperative to preventing future acts of violence.\\"  I sense my socio-cultural paradigm has shifted since reading this book.  And I hope that my personal baby-steps toward a more careful handling of the involved issues can serve to further future prevention of violence in some way.<br /><br />While it is true that this book was written by a woman who is principally an academic, it's also true the research that went into it involved a great deal of field work and contact with law enforcement, victims and true believers themselves.<br /><br />Groups covered include various millenial religions, domestic terrorism groups (many of which mix component forms of Christian/pagan religious expression with extreme racial theories), international terrorist groups with an emphasis on violent Islamic groups, various Satanist groups, Vampirism, and syncretic belief systems such as Santeria and Voodoo.  Dr. Perlmutter then addresses various intelligence strategies for maximizing the public benefit of an informed investigative approach.  The book is also a wealth of resources for gaining additional information.  This dynamic field of study is difficult to set in print as though it were some sort of unchanging holy text, and the author acknowledges ongoing development.<br /><br />The book is not alarmist, but does raise concerns.  Crimes incidental to the practice of ritual violence covered in the book range from mild trespassing and littering issues through threats and assaults to violent crimes against persons including homicide.  The cases are well-documented and photographs and illustrations are plentiful.  This is not a coffee-table book; the photographs and symbols (germane to the topic, always) can be unpleasant.  While there are those who find any expression of intolerance to be small-minded, social intolerance of crime - especially violent crime - is both sensible and lawful.  One man's xenophobia is another man's kidnapping and cannibalism.<br /><br />While the author's initial area of academic expertise was art symbolism and religious art, she has become an expert in the related field of physical evidence of ritual violence.  For many practitioners of violent religious expression I suppose, their holy places are superior to the best available sacred art.  Her book has grown out of her law enforcement consulting experiences, not the other way around.  And, as a law enforcement professional, I'm glad she published it.al intolerance of crime - especially violent crime - is both sensible and lawful.

But not all scholars and academics can present such a story as lucidly, concisely and with as much genuine love of their subject as Mr. Grant, a retired LDS Educational System employee.<br /><br />Much of the material in Mr. Palmer's books has appeared elsewhere, in other forms.  His bibliographies alone may be worth the price of the book for those students of Mormon origins.  Mr. Palmer has examined that older evidence (such as theories on secular sources of inspiration for the Book of Mormon and other LDS canonical writings), cleaned it up and represented it without the negative and unnecessary polemical material.  Some of his material is new or extracted from theses and dissertations not popularly available before.  He respects his readers and gives them information upon which to base their own judgments.<br /><br />If you're looking for a scholarly, academic and technically critical examination of the origins of Mormonism (like Richard Bushman's less critical but yet excellent \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism\\"), then this is the book for you.  If you're looking for something more mean-spirited with jangling polemics, then it's not.	2005-04-23

One of his theses is that Sonny Liston was always the sharecropper's kid, even as a successful boxer.  That's why, in Tosches' view, Sonny wouldn't have had difficulty doing what he was told from \\"the man.\\"<br /><br />Maybe, maybe not.  In any event Mr. Tosches covers the events of Sonny Liston's life.  This book has no light spots, really.  It's all medium gray to black.  Maybe it's this perceived lack of contrast that irritates some readers.  Maybe that's the way Sonny Liston's life really was.<br /><br />The Liston that Tosches leaves us with isn't particularly likeable, but somehow you end up feeling something for the man.  In the end, I get the impression from Mr. Tosches that he's telling us that Sonny was our creation, that we made him.  To that degree, perhaps we deserved some of the unpleasantness that came from the sad boxer with the massive hands and the pile-driving punch.  And, maybe, to that degree Sonny was a victim.<br /><br />I'd give the book a 3 for substance and a 5 for style.  Guess I'll settle for a 4.  And \\"settling\\" is pretty much what Liston's life was about.	2005-04-23

About the year 200 AD, these traditions - revolving around the interpretation and illustration of the Torah - were collected and written down in the Mishna.  Over time, additional traditions, or Gemara, were also preserved.  The two main groups of Jews, Palestinian and Babylonian, over the next couple hundred years, collected their Mishnaic and Gemaran traditions along with other authoritative rabbinical sayings into, respectively, the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds.  The Babylonian Talmud runs about 30 volumes!<br /><br />R. Travers Herford had a love of and respect for the Talmud.  In his introduction he reminds the reader of this history of the Talmud, the often religiously charged atmosphere in which it was written, and the faith of the Jews who passed it from generation to generation.  He reviews that massive work and capably, with commentary, lists possible references to Christ, his disciples, Christianity and Jewish dealings with Christians.  In his commentary he notes from which \\"layer\\" of the Talmudic tradition the statement is made thereby giving some sort of dating to the statement.<br /><br />Herford has been criticized for seeing too many references as being related to Christ.  Frankly, I see that as a benefit because at least Herford allows you to examine the citation for yourself.  I use Herford with other commentaries on the Talmud.	2005-04-23

One of Mr. Benner's early suppositions is that since (he believes) the Tower of Babel was a literal event, then early Hebrew writing evidences that Adam and Eve, as well as God, spoke Hebrew which was not confounded at Babel.  This is a striking assertion with no supporting academic material.<br /><br />His efforts at linking Hebrew writing with the Hebrew mentality that concentrated on action over abstract thought is a little better thought out, but that's been done before by Hebrew scholars in better books.<br /><br />If you're a fundamentalist Christian, then you'll probably accept what Mr. Benner has to offer.  If you're interested in a more scholarly approach, or come from a branch of Christianity/Judaism that requires a less literal approach to Genesis, then you'll find this tome pretty slim pickin's.	2004-10-14

If there are those who are willing to criticize his work for not revealing every little detail about the life of St. Irenaeus, it's because we actually don't know much about him above what he wrote and the later comments of other writers - most of them incidental to other conversations.  Grant has collected the essential information about the Bishop of Lyons and has, in my opinion, covered the most interesting parts of \\"Against Heresies\\" in his translation.<br /><br />Recommended for those who are students of early Christian history and heresies.  Irenaeus writes cleanly and it's not too difficult to discover the trajectory of the gnostic threat from his arguments.  In fact, Irenaeus, as noted by Pelikan, is the father of the traditional Catholic/Orthodox/Anglican three-fold authority (Scripture, Tradition and apostolic authority).	2004-10-14

That said, sometimes the \\"fresh\\" \\"new\\" look is just another way of packaging a worthless, fleeting novelty.  Once in awhile, though, \\"fresh\\" means a shift in paradigm.<br /><br />Alter's translation is thoughtful, readable, and faithful to the spirit and dignity of the great book of Genesis.  As a man who principally looks at Genesis through literary eyes, one might think his commentary would be reduced to cold faithlessness.  But Alter is deeply linked to the faith of the authors and what they were trying to tell.  He leaves the judgment of the story to the reader.<br /><br />As a believer, I also appreciated Alter's comments on the intelligence of the composition.  To him, it's not just a collection of old legends, but a story with a plan - a tapestry with patterns to be sure woven into a sensible design.<br /><br />In a day where we've chaptered and versified the Bible to death, Alter's holistic treatment probably gets back to the spirit in which the original account was probably presented.	2004-10-14

The Epistles of St. Clement of Rome and St. Ignatius of Antioch (Ancient Christian Writers)	Books	5	26	28	N	Y	They were preserving that which was given them.	Clement, bishop of Rome, was responding to reports about troubles again with those pesky Corinthian Christians.  40 years or so earlier, St. Paul had done the same.  It's easy to see why for the first couple hundred years (even Eusebius, bp. of Ceasarea in Palestine considered it inspired in the early 4th century) this letter circulated with what would become the New Testament writings.  His faith is apostolic as is his belief that he's merely standing in an authoritative line of men who are exhorting Christian behavior and beliefs.  This letter was probably composed about the same time some of the writings of St. John were, and probably before 2 Peter and some of the pseudepigraphical Pauline literature.<br /><br />This volume also shares with the reader the early 2nd century writings of Ignatius, bishop of Antioch and martyr.

(Even as a Roman Catholic, one of my favorite translations in English is the NASB.)  At times, however, the translators in order to keep this from the stiffness found in academic study translations seemed to slip into near colloquialisms.  Somewhere in this translation I read &quot;ignoramus.&quot;  It was a little distracting.  And in I Cor. 9:26 just the other day I was similarly distracted by Paul's &quot;I do not fight as if I were shadowboxing&quot; where a less comical image in the RSV is of Paul futilely &quot;beating the air.&quot;  I would personally prefer a retention of some of the archaic speech where the modern speech upsets the cadence of the Scripture.  But the purpose of this translation seems to have been an attempt to strike a balance between accessibility and literalness.  Generally, I believe the translators met that goal.<br />The notes.  Ahhhhh.  The notes.  Of interest especially for the Roman Catholic, and also for the general Catholic and high Protestant are the wonderful notes.  Many fundamentalists who don't accept the Elohist/Yahwist schools of Old Testament study, and the &quot;Q&quot; Gospel source theory will be upset by the copious, legible notations, text breaks and subject headings, and expository book introductions.  For me, they make the Sacred Scripture come to life by breathing context into the writings.<br />It is this particular translation of the Sacred Scripture with its notes and study aids that finally allowed me to make my first productive reading of Leviticus and Numbers.  Where before I had dutifully plowed just to plow, this time I came away learning and cross-referencing and stopping to ponder the mercies of a God who gave us a fantastic type of His Son in Moses, the great &quot;Legislator&quot; (as Josephus would title him).	2002-06-11

I thought about it off and on all day after finishing it.<br />le Carre's characters, for me, are timeless in spite of the dated contexts of his stories.  In this treatment, we follow the self-proclaimed believer-of-nothing, washed out spy Alec Leamas on his last, greatest, most perilous mission in ostensible service of freedom and the Western way against the Red Plague of eastern communism.  The reality for Alec, though, is much more personal and shallow.  This story is fleshed out with complex sympathetic and contemptible characters (some of them are both).<br />For some people, this story is an exercize in the fruits of nihilism.  For others, it is about a man who works through his own stubbornness and finds a type of faith.  This book avoids the question \\"Does the end justify the means?\\" and simply observes that sometimes whether or not we like it that we justify what we do by whether or not \\"our side\\" benefits.  The terribly frightening thing is that for most people, \\"our side\\" is an accident of birth.  One of the great theses in this book is that often we are, truly, the same as our enemies.  The great socio-institutional weapons we build to destroy each other kill both the thistles and the gentle flowers, and sometimes we become slaves of our own creations.  What is the value of societies vs. the value of persons?  And who gets to decide?  Man has invented deadly games that he, to the exclusion of morality and even reason, pursues with only the goal of winning, despite cost.<br />This is also simply one of the saddest stories ever told, anytime.	2002-06-11

Theism & Objective Morality	I was prepared, as a Roman Catholic, to disagree with Drs. LaHaye and Noebel on many points in their examination of latter-day godlessness.  And although I may still have some criticisms of some of their specific complaints, I came away quite impressed with their arguments supporting their general thesis (with which I agree):  \\"Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength . . . [b]ut blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him.\\"<br />The battle for the mind is quite simple, the authors tell us:  Morality and Truth (absolute super-human values) vs. Amorality and Consensus (variable, situational rules).  Man has put his Creator on trial and, in many instances, banished Him.  And while the authors specifically detail the battle in the U.S., the ultimate war is global.<br />Indeed, all people who believe in the absolute moral authority of God will find in this book a message that is uncharacteristically (dare I say it?) ecumenical coming from evangelical biblical Christianity.  Dr. LaHay says it best as he illustrates the importance in all people of faith in coming together for this conflict: \\"When I was assigned to a B-29 flight crew as a waist gunner, I did not ask the other ten men whether they were Catholics, Jews, or Protestants.  I merely wanted to know if they could fly the plane or shoot the 50-millimeter machine guns.  Later I discovered that the other waist-gunner was a Mormon, the turret gunner a Catholic, and the tail gunner a Southern Baptist.  We probably never could have worked together on a religious project (in fact, we could not talk about theology without disagreement), but on one fundamental issue we were in 100 percent agreement: We were all Americans interested in preserving our country's freedom.\\" [pp. 225,26]<br />I would have liked to see a little more dissertation on the value of spiritual evidences and the valuelessness of empirical evidences in spiritual arguments.  The notes were hard to sort through given their collection at the end of the book instead of chapter, and the lack of easily distinguishable sectioning type.  Still, this is a great work and a distillation of many modern writings and thoughts related to this secular v. ecclesial conflict.

The characters were rich, in the sort of intentionally caricaturish way of Sinclair's Babbitt.  And although our lead character sometimes kicked on his line like a tuna at sea, the reel drew steadily in through his superficial, plastic world to a thought-provoking conclusion.<br />I guess the author thought a few of the dangling things he opened the story with weren't necessary for the flavor of the finish.  In retrospect, I guess he's right.	2002-05-20

This fantastic book enabled me to do some minor examinations and repairs, and gave me a much better appreciation for those truly skilled piano rebuilders out there.<br />If you've ever wondered just what an upright or grand piano action really did, or why all those levers, pinioned joints, felt pads, etc. needed to be there, or what that third pedal is for, this is the book to own.  The piano is the last great analog machine out there, and I hope it remains with us for generations to come.	2002-04-30

During her scholarly study of Joseph Smith's early writings and those of his contemporaries, she was given special access to historical archives of the LDS church - probably due to her relation to LDS general authority David O. McKay.  The resulting history, with its rich and enjoyable literary style, easily qualifies as the first truly full biography of Joseph Smith, Jr.  Mrs. Brodie gives credit where credit is due:  &quot;The Prophet&quot; is credited with an aversion to violence, a genuine love for people (especially tender affection for children), manful behavior during his lengthy Liberty Jail incarceration, the power to win over even many of his enemies once personally introduced, and a powerful, driving imagination and energy.  Proper criticisms are levelled against his lack of financial acumen, his inclination to see apparently fictional &quot;historical evidences&quot; in the things around him, his likely inability to constructively examine himself, and his extra-marital dalliances which more likely served as the cause of &quot;plural marriage&quot; rather than the effect of it.  Her pointed examination of the Book of Abraham appears to have been vindicated in later years.  (I have the 1954 edition.)  And so on.  While not a perfect work (is any writing of man or woman?), its strengths are sufficient to make it a must-have, must-read for anyone interested in Mormon studies.	2002-04-26

Meadows	Juanita Brooks, a life-long southern Utahn, used her considerable native talent, her drive for the truth, and many years of effort to compile this first exhaustive, honest examination of the Mountain Meadows massacre.  It is especially impressive given the fact that Ms. Brooks wasn't by vocation a historian or scholar.  Her narrative is lucid and complete.  Her analysis has proven, in the context of additional investigation, to be principally correct.  Throughout it all, Ms. Brooks remained also a faithful LDS (Mormon) woman, in spite of her disappointments with her contemporary LDS church leadership as it related to her investigation.  This should be a starting point for any serious student of the Mountain Meadows massacre.  Ms. Brooks shows us a world of grays with very human characters whom she places into a carefully resurrected context.	2002-04-21

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Magnum Opus of a Great Soul	I first read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings about the time the author died in 1973.  I've since read the Hobbit another four or five times, and his trilogy twice.  I've read about everything else he's published.<br />John Ronald Ruel Tolkien was a quiet, peaceful man who was orphaned at a young age, raised by his parish priest, suffered shell shock during the Great War and later became a sensitive, loving father and husband, master of languages, friend of C.S. Lewis, and died complete.  He was a man of faith who made up a world unrelated to his religion where the characters there, also, had to struggle against evil.  That's what the Lord of the Rings is about.<br />While the movies look like they'll be good, please don't pass up the opportunity to bathe in Tolkien's printed word.  There are so many sublime, powerful moments to be discovered.  I was seized by racking sobs at the author's narrative of Sam contemplating the stars while Frodo slept in the heart of Mordor.  Please take the time to read these books and find your own great moments.	2002-04-21

Usually, the Roman Catholic church relies on local or regional definitions of the complete Faith.  Every several hundred years, she pulls it together into something universal.  We happen to have lived in a time when the world can enjoy a contemporary text that distills and elucidates Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition within the context of the Magesterium (teaching authority of the church via the bishops).  Every Roman Catholic should have this book.  Everyone else who wonders what Roman Catholicism is about should get a copy.  I finally got through my first reading of this Catechism, and am getting the first dark glimpse of the Big Catholic Picture.  I'm looking forward to going through it again and again.

Still, this is the best study Bible out there.  The translators have held to their literal word-for-word translation philosophy (as opposed to though-for-thought &quot;translation,&quot; or concept-for-concept &quot;interpretation of some of the weaker English Bibles).  The only significant criticism, worth about a 1/2 star is that modern study can still benefit from the technically archaic second person singlar/plural (thou, thee, thy, thine and you, ye, your, yours) when attempting to discern whether or not the addressor was speaking to single persons, or more than one.  I keep my KJV handy for that, in addition to my Spanish Reina-Valera 1960.  : )<br />Ignore those who complain about lack of notes.  This Bible wasn't meant to have them.  Get yourself a good couple of commentaries and have at it, if notes are what you want.	2002-04-16

He, therefore, takes Mr. Smith at his word as it relates to the chronology of many of the important LDS claims.  He is otherwise reasonably critical and respectably analytical with the context of Joseph's arrival in the world up through the movement of the early Mormons to Kirtland, Ohio in 1831.  Mr. Bushman confirms contemporary belief of the final composition of 1 &amp; 2 Nephi after the rest of the Book of Mormon, as well as contrasting the early Mormon view of &quot;restoration&quot; being simply restoring Israel to its rightful place to the later, more fundamental &quot;restoration&quot; that the LDS Church holds today.  I would have loved to read more of his analysis of the development of the early Mormon priesthood hierarchy, from Joseph and Oliver Cowdery as 1st and 2nd Elders of the Church, respectively, to the later Rigdonite, full-blown priesthood.  Still, there's only so much one can cover in a &quot;Beginnings&quot; book.  A great read for students, faithful LDS/Community of Christ/etc. or otherwise, of early Mormon history.	2002-04-16

This is actually the story of a man who slowly lost *enthusiasm* in his search for historical support for the Book of Mormon, but not *faith* until the Book of Abraham problems of the mid-1960s shot his Balloon of Faith full of holes.  While the story is of general interest to students of contemporary LDS faith history, this is really one man's story.  The four stars are for the excellent documentation and the fleshing out of that one man's character.  Still, both faithful and faithless can come away with their beliefs fully intact...	2002-04-16

B.H. Roberts and James Talmage are my two favorite LDS authors.  I'm a former LDS convert to Roman Catholicism.  Still, LDS history is *my* history and I just can't get away from it.<br />In this collection of letters and writings by Brigham Henry Roberts, we get a better story about a good man than criticisms about the Book of Mormon.  Much of Mr. Roberts' observations with regard to American archaeology are sufficiently dated as to be only compelling because, at the time, they were novel and painful for a faithful LDS leader to bring up.  His later personal investigation into the potential intellectual and literary seeds of the Book of Mormon through his examination of View of the Hebrews and other \\"common knowledge\\" circa 1830 were more interesting.<br />Above all, the fearless, faithful B.H. Roberts continually exhorted his ecclesiastical superiors to examine their faith in the context of the issues he scratched at.  He implored them to seek inspiration to get celestial answers for, especially, the \\"youth of the church.\\"  He encourage them to enlist God to supply answers to what he considered to be troubling, yet ultimately answerable problems with the cornerstone of the LDS Church: The Book of Mormon and the claims of Joseph Smith.	2002-04-02

Dr. Anderson takes a fine point to the early life of Joseph Smith.  With impeccable care and documentation, he leads us through the childhood of a man who would exhibit a type of genius rarely seen in charismatic leaders.  Anderson wisely limits himself to the effects of Joseph's experiences in the composition and contents of the Book of Mormon.  By the time the &quot;semi-retired psychiatrist&quot; gets to the end of the book, he barely needs to justify or explain his diagnosis since he's already done so from a variety of angles previously.  My only criticism is that occasionally Dr. Anderson extends his theories and suppositions quite far, but he usually does so with qualifications.<br />Not for the initiate into the arcane world of LDS theology and history.  Try &quot;Mormon America&quot; first.  But for a guy like me who spent 40 years (two as a missionary) in &quot;the Church,&quot; it's a haunting trip into the mind of a very famous, unique American religious leader.	2002-02-26

It was published by the Farnsworth family and no where in its pages mentions the LDS (Mormon)church.  Yet the spin this tome places on primitive American peoples (all one, belief in one God, appearing out of &quot;nowhere&quot; about 600 B.C., belief in resurrection, etc.) in an ostensibly academic way would lead the casual reader (for whom this is intended) to believe that this is mainstream thinking.

Indeed, some losses shine more brightly than a dozen victories.  If the story of Leonidas and his several thousand countrymen in their volunteer suicide mission at the fateful pass of Thermopylae doesn't make your heart ache and your eyes wet, then you're already dead.  Mr. Bradford, as other historians, also recognizes what the Greeks did for our culture by stemming the Eastern Tide as it prepared to wash over Europe.  The author doesn't pretend academic position.  He just tells a great story.  Great because it's true, and great because good men and women everywhere can see that selflessness is timeless in the Greek sacrifice at that high mountain pass.	2002-02-26

Antiquities isn't merely a re-telling of the Old Testament; there's fresh new material in there about the Legislator (Moses), and many other great characters from Israelite history.<br />One gets a sense, through the text, of the conflicted Josephus: A man who was a Pharisee by early training and in his heart, yet a Roman intellectually and through adoption. Late in life, Josephus became a sort of Christian (whether or not through his Ebionitism he was able to accept Christ as divine is uncertain), but he was always devoted - at least academically - to his Jewish ethnicity. He was also a survivor and, in my opinion, probably possessed an expediency that the martyrs would have found distasteful.<br />Through it all, his histories have generally been given great credence by historians who, since they can corroborate some of it, come to rely on most of it. I use Josephus along with Smith's Bible Dictionary as two of my half-dozen principal tools in adding flavor and color to my Bible studies.	2001-09-25

This book also does a great job of explaining how the LDS Church is indelibly American.  I also believe that Richard Ostling has hit the nail on the head as he projects increasing LDS isolationism (intellectually and in general theological terms) following a number of ecumenical and exploratory decades.<br />They show us a church of likeable, industrious people with a unique and colorful history which nonetheless offers a radically distinct theology in a well-presented and slickly sold package.<br />I was LDS my first 40 years and am now Roman Catholic.	2001-09-21

Williamson who observes that in spite of the cumbersome Greek employed by the Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, that Eusebius was well-aware of his own limitations, yet gathered, assembled and compiled a work which has endured beyond much of its source material.  As a student of Pamphilus (who was killed in the last great persecution), Eusebius also possessed a great passion for his work.  This was no namby-pamby intellectual here.  Eusebius himself was imprisoned for his Lord a couple of times.  At the same time, he was a big-time player in the new Catholic Church, sitting in and piping up at the Nicean Council.<br /><br />Whether you get it to read it through (as I did), or get it as a reference (which I also did), this is one work (much like Josephus' Antiquities) you need to have.

I  first read this work when I was 14 or so (with a dictionary by my side),  and have returned to it repeatedly.  Talmage's description of the Christ in  the Garden of Gethsemane and his stirring recounting of Jesus' moment of  aloneness on the cross left indelible impressions upon me.<br />If you're LDS,  it's a must-read.

As interesting as the commentary itself are the 150+ pages of &quot;articles,&quot; or essays  covering subjects from &quot;Hebrew History to the Exile&quot; to  &quot;Bible Chronology.&quot;  The motivating sentiment of the authors was,  as stated in the &quot;General Introduction,&quot; that &quot;[t]he Bible  is the source as well as the result of inspiration...  Every detail  regarding it therefore is interesting.&quot;  In the minds of the  commentarians, then, there's no such thing as &quot;Bible minutiae,&quot; a  de jure oxymoron.<br />The commentary enjoys a balanced feel between the  contextualist (generally Catholic) and literalist (flavors of Protestant)  schools of Bible thought, and is a great source for throwing a little extra  light on some of those obscure passages.

While I may stipulate that Mormonism - Shadow or Reality? isn't a scholarly work, I'm impressed with the sincerity  and general honesty of the writers.  Mr. and Mrs. Tanner's greatest  contribution to history is their unceasing effort to gather and publish  source material which the LDS church has modified over the years beyond  recognition.  The LDS church would say that a living prophet is better than  a dead one, and that any changes have been authorized by God through His  servants.  Perhaps, but if that's not enough for you, the Tanners give you  some of the material you need to come to your own conclusion.<br />The LDS  church itself teaches that &quot;by the power of the Holy Ghost you may  know the truth of all things.&quot;  They should let history stand where it  is, without the tampering.<br />I'm 40 years old and served a 2 year LDS  mission to Chile.	2000-05-14
