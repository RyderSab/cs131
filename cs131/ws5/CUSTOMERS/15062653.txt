He provides some really good information on why people believe.  Polls taken show that men in general try to justify their beliefs in myths through rational means while women tend to focus on the emotional.  Though the analysis was for the most part factual, I could certainly see why women might be offended.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the book to me was the evidence regarding men believers.  Confronted with evidence that shoots them down, men true believers of all myths have resorted to amazing mental gymnastics to believe what they believe.  In this regard I found the book remarkable and useful.  Though it seeks to understand believers, in the end it exposes them as the weak, superstitious, intellectual panty-wastes they are.	2005-09-02

Books	5	5	5	N	N	Alot of good information in a small book	The authors do a very good job of explaining the evidence for ice ages and how the earth is currently in an inter-glacial stage within the overall ice age of the planet.  The book discusses theories regarding the causes of the ice age from the movement of continents towards the poles as well as slight variations in the orbit of the earth around the sun that occur over time at regular intervals.<br /><br />Though none of us reviewing the book will live to see a return to a glaciation phase in the ice age, it is interesting to note that we are well on our way towards the period when glaciation will occur again.  The shortened growing season of such a period could spell disaster for our descendents.<br /><br />I was deeply impressed with how much interesting and relevant information the authors were able to provide in a short little book.  If you have a cross-country flight and you are looking for a really interesting book to read, this is one I highly recommend.	2005-08-28

One of the best things about this book is that the foods listed also come with sidekicks.  Most of the foods are not only nutritious, but delicious as well.  All of a sudden, something like a turkey sandwich with spinach leaves, tomatoes, and made with oat bread is a superfood buffet.  Another delectable delight, vanilla yogurt with fresh blueberries, walnuts, and oats is an ideal, filling and tastey breakfast.<br /><br />The inclusion of pumpkin is a little problematic for me because I have mostly ingested pumpkin in pastries and in pies.  Winter squash will probably do in meeting the pumpkin requirement though I'll take the challenge to find more creative uses for pumpkin.  (Anyone have a good pumpkin soup recipe to share?)  The inclusion of soybeans and beans is a little duplicative though I have to admit that nothing goes with beer as well as edadame.  Except in high sodium Chinese soups, I don't do tofu so I might have to find other ways for using edadame if I'm going to follow the book's soy recommendation.<br /><br />The authors by including tea as a superfood makes my former Mormon self chuckle a bit.  Evil tea listed as a health food?  Joe I guess you messed up on that one.  As for salmon, it's a good news bad news situation.  I love salmon, but try finding affordable wild salmon in Utah.  The farmed, color added stuff just doesn't cut it health-wise or taste wise.  I have made salmon salads from canned Alaskan salmon on a bed of spinach leaves, mixed with tomatoes, broccoli, walnuts, and orange slices.  It was actually quite tastey.  I might have to take a trip to Alaska every summer to meet the Superfoods recommendation, but I'll give it a go.<br /><br />All in all, I found this book a pretty good nutritional guide.  The only thing better would have been if he added a good cold lager as a superfood.	2005-08-12

Covering in sufficient detail the events that led to war, as well as the pre-war obsession with pre-conceived strategies for the actualized theoretical war, this unnecessary war is indeed a tragedy of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Keegan is effective in covering the essentials of the conflict though the British perspective is certainly noted.  Even so, Keegan is an effective communicator of the nature of the conflict and exceeds in covering the most critical details of how the war progressed and how it was ultimately lost by the Axis powers.  Acknowledging the military successes of the axis even as their goals were inevitably unattainable, this book effectively explains in limited pages the nature and scope of the conflict.<br /><br />For those students of history who seek a concise history of World War I, I highly recommend this book.	2005-07-25

This terrifying reality is still sinking in and its implications are profound for the health of our democracy.  Though this book is damning to the press and the extent to which it has now become an apparatus under the control of the right, little is discussed in the book how someone can look for and find objective news reporting.  Yeah, its buyer beware out there and Americans are being fed propaganda instead of news, but what is the answer?  I would have liked to see answers, not just gripes.<br /><br />Though there is much good information in this book, I found the author's writing style a bit labored and disjointed.  Alot of pieces are hanging out there not tied together in context with over-riding themes.  This book would have benefitted by the author carefully crafting an outline and tying the evidence together to make four or five strong points.  Having the goods on the Republican noise machine isn't enough to put together a five star book.<br /><br />Even with the flaws, I recommend this book because of the information in there.  And if the author overstates a case here and there, as one reviewer put it, it is certainly more balanced than Fox (Pravda) News.	2005-07-16

This book starts with the seige of Boston and focuses on Washington's army and the individuals close to Washington.  The book is rich with interesting quotes from the time period and the author did a good job of deciding what to include and what to leave out.<br /><br />Great care is taken to explain the British position and the diverse factions that either supported the war to reign in the colonies or opposed the heavey-handed handling of the affair by King George III.<br /><br />The military history is fascinating in the book as it retells the story of the seizure of the Dorchester heights forcing the British out of Boston.  The fortification of New York and Washington's constantly getting outfoxed by the British and Hessians is always an interesting story.  With the spark of independence waning fast, Washington's raid on Trenton and Princeton though militarily insignificant, had a huge impact on saving the rebel cause.<br /><br />As I celebrated Independence Day, I was reminded of the cost of our freedom in our country.  I was reminded how close an affair it had been and how the war could have easily gone to the British.  I'm also reminded that George Washington wasn't a great general, but a great leader.  More than military strategy, the American Independence was won through the determination and perserverence of some remarkable men.  Thanks to the author for a timely reminder of what they did.	2005-07-08

Books	5	10	18	N	N	Fascinating but controversial book	The thesis statement of this book is that the Jesus myths as told in the New Testament derive not from a historical Jesus of Nazareth, but from the adaptation of other \\"mystery cults\\" that were prevalent in the Meditranean.  The striking similarities between the Egyptian Osiris myths, Greek Dionysian myths as well as the myths of Attis, Adonis and Mithrais with the New Testament mythologies are indeed striking.  A Godman born to a virgin who was the son of God, rebirth through baptism, turning water into wine at a wedding, and many other New Testament myths appear to have predecessors in other religions prevalent at the time of one Jesus of Nazareth was purported to have been lived and died.  The lack of evidence for a historical Jesus adds to the strength of the thesis statement of this book.<br /><br />The book also tries to answer the question of whether \\"Gnostic Christianity\\" was the original Christianity.  Evaluating the political environment at the time of Constantine and the desire of Roman Bishops to exercise control over the diverse sects and philosophies of Roman citizens, a compelling case is made for the creation of literalist Christianity out of geo-political considerations.<br /><br />Some Gibbonesque assertions that literalist Christianity brought to ruin the enlightenment of the ancient Greco/Roman world is fraught with danger and judgments.  However, the correlation between strict interpretation of God's revealed word and the social and economic decline of civilizations is certainly not without merit.<br /><br />An interesting book that makes me want to know more about the current research on the origins of the Christian mythologies.  Not a book that Christian literalists and fundamentalists will likely even crack, even so it poses the question if there was not a literal historical Jesus, should the followers of these myths be allowed any moral high ground on the basis of belief in them and should they be allowed to use the apparatus of the state to impose their ill-founded beliefs on a Democratic society?the state to impose their ill-founded beliefs on a Democratic society?	2005-07-03

This book focuses on the life and times of John of Gaunt, prince of England and the Duke of Lancaster.  One of the most powerful English Dukes who never became King, he is indeed an interesting figure and there is much of the book that is interesting in that regard.  I found the portrayal by the author of Gaunt as a pragmatist quite convincing in the context of the turbulent times that Gaunt dominated English politics.  His flirtations with the heresies of Wycliff and the patronage of the budding English humanism you find in Chaucer contrasts sharpely with a man devoted to English institutions and the well being of the Plantagenet dynasty.  There is much to recommend in this book that I enjoyed reading.<br /><br />However, I found the author's writing style labored and difficult.  Some editorial comments meant to sound witty seemed out of place and detracted rather than added to the enjoyment of the book.  There were also some sentences that needed a good editor to correct some structure problems and even correct some spelling errors.  Unsupported assertions were also rife in the book.  Most disturbing was the fact that there were some significant historical inaccuracies in the book.For example, the author mentions a daughter of Gaunt and Catherine Swynford, Margaret Beaufort, who married Edmond Tudor who was the mother of Henry VII.  A little genealogical research shows that Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII was the daughter of John Beaufort, who was the son of John \\"Fairborn\\" Beaufort who was the son of John of Gaunt.  That makes Margaret Beaufort the great grand-daughter of John of Gaunt, a two generation discrepancy.  He also lists John Duke of Bedford as a grandson correctly since he was the son of Henry IV.  However he then goes on to list Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Bedford's younger brother, as John of Gaunt's great-grandson.  A second pair of eyes and a good editor should have been able to detect these errors and correct them.<br /><br />The writing style and editing problems detract significantly from the overall historical value of this book.  If the author had remained alive, I would have hoped he would in the future revise the book, correct the problems and perhaps add some more information about Gaunt's Beaufort children and grand-children who were so significant in the political history  of England in the 15th Century.<br /><br />Some day, I hope a better writer comes along and takes the subject matter Norman Cantor addressed and presents it in a more substantial and substantiated way.on.

From the high baroque works of J.S. Bach and Scarlatti to the early works of Beethoven, this book discusses the evolution of keyboard music during the pivotal 18th Century.  Excellent chapters on C.P.E. Bach, on Haydn, and the Italian style I found particularly interesting.  Ironic that the leading proponent of the Italian style during the century would be the German Johann Christian Bach whose stylistic influence on Mozart appears to have been profound.<br /><br />One of the better books I've read on objectively looking at the direct influences, or lack thereof, of J.S. Bach on C.P.E. Bach and C.P.E. Bach on Haydn.  The author makes a strong and compelling case for evaluating each composer in their own right because of how much they diverge from each other in so many fundamental ways in how they used the keyboard instruments of their day.<br /><br />For those music lovers who find the wide variety of keyboard music from the 18th Century fascinating, this book does a good job of putting it all in the context of the times and influences of the period as well as acknowledges the creative genius of so many composers who represent the period.	2005-06-20

I read this book in the early 80's, not long after Dr. Eyring passed away.  A deeply intelligent man, he tried hard to reconcile his faith with science in general.  Most interesting were his comments on evolution where he was loath to discount both the intellect and motives of those who believed evolution was scientifically sound.  What a breath of fresh air such statements were in an era where religious dogmatists such as Bruce R. McConkie and Boyd K. Packer were moving the LDS church away from a culture of learning to an insular world of strict interpretation of scripture and blind obedience to authority.<br /><br />Henry Eyring if alive today would be deeply alarmed at what he would see in the religion of his heritage.  The LDS church is in deep turmoil because the church stubbornly holds to implausible myths, when the scientific method exposes those myths for what they are.  After Boyd K. Packer's \\"The Mantle is Far Greater\\" speech, the LDS church has lost all credibility with the scientific community and intellectual thought within the Mormon corridor has been suppressed and villified.  This book by a dying old chemist was hopefully not the last gasp of Mormon intellectual thought.  May this blessed man rest in peace.<br /><br />(...)	2005-05-16

Of course, the scope of Insannity's evil includes nearly half the country who have the gaul to question a President's decision to go to war on the basis of what another country MIGHT do to us. Of course, after your troops are already there and thousands of civilians and hundreds of our soldiers are dead, we find out that Bush misled us by overstating the threat Iraq posed.  By Insannity's thesis, if you oppose Bush, you are now the evil one because you stand for the truth?  What kind of morality are we dealing with here?  It is a twisted world where Insannity wraps himself up in the flags of the United States and Christianity in order to weave a web of deceit, division and demagoguery.  If you want to be delivered from evil, this book will not deliver the intended results.  It will only further validate lying to the American public and is actually a mirror projection of itself.

This book is in that category.  Well, this book and many of it's cohorts argue against Mormonism on the basis that Mormonism \\"isn't Christian.\\"  Well, it depends on your definition of Christian I suppose.  Mormons profess a belief in Jesus Christ though have a different interpretation of who Christ is and what his death and resurrection means within their respective religions.  Are Mormons Christians?  Frankly I couldn't care less.  The hokey revelations of Joseph Smith are certainly different than the paranoid and delusional revelations of John of Patmos.  As for evidence, there certainly isn't any evidence that Native Americans are transplanted Jews as the Book of Mormon teaches.  Even so, there is no real reliable evidence that a guy named Jesus from Nazareth was crucified and died for the sins of those who believe in him.<br /><br />I get real nervous when I continue to hear people say \\"MY RELIGION IS TRUE.\\"  What is \\"TRUE CHRISTIANITY?\\"  By looking at the ignorance and dependence that it spreads, I'd say it isn't all that much better than Mormonism.

Quinn's latest edition of \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View\\" is not a light and easy read.  However, the information contained is well-documented and Quinn makes a compelling case for the origins of the Mormon faith.  Quinn is surprisingly non-judgmental of Joseph Smith and early Mormon leaders in this book and appears to, as best as possible, dispassionately explain early Mormonism within the framework of 19th Century superstitions, occult practices and folk magic.  Quinn addresses a facet of Americana that doesn't get enough research or serious discussion; the role that folk magic and the occult played in 19th Century America.<br /><br />After reading this book, many of the myths and practices of Mormonism make more sense and the unique culture and history of this remarkable church is much better understood.  This groundbreaking work, though ridiculed by so-called FARMS scholars, sets the standard for early Mormon studies and is one of the most valuable books out there for understanding Mormon origins.<br /><br />One concern I have with the most recent version is that Quinn appears to spend too much time answering his critics and responding to apologists for the Mormon Church.  Quinn's research and perspective stands on its own without reference to apologists.  Perhaps a chapter addressing apologists separately would have worked better than addressing them throughout the book.  Apologists (or as Quinn calls them \\"polemicists\\") really aren't worthy of the mention Quinn gives them in this book. They aren't scholars but advocates and mention of them and their spurious arguments should be relegated to the back page as Krakauer did in \\"Under the Banner of Heaven.\\"  Quinn is a courageous and honest scholar.  Soiling his book with the opinions of non-scholars such as Daniel Peterson and that Hamblin dude only weakens the book.  Even so, I gave this book four stars because of the value of the information contained.

Like all conservative radio talking heads, he builds up a liberal straw man, taking statements out of context or building upon outright lies and then attacks this theoretical liberal. Insannity calls \\"liberals\\" the enemy. I proudly wear that label because I believe liberalism is at the heart of what America stands for. Liberalism, as Thomas Jefferson knew it, John Stuart Mill knew it, as James Madison knew it, was about free market competition of ideas. Insannity is about compliance to a narrow world view. Liberals are about supporting the most likely best outcome based upon the available evidence. Liberals look forward to progress and to more liberty. Insannity looks to a mythical past as a recipe for creating a future America that is contrary to American values and ideals.<br /><br />Insannity is a demogogue who appeals to the worst of America. He represents those who wave and wear the flag, but soil the flag's meaning. Those who praise liberty with their mouths, but suppress it with their actions. Insannity has a right to express himself and he seems to make a decent living doing so. But calling those who differ in their vision of America as evil is un-American. I am proud to stand against the demogoguery of Insannity, Limberger, Coulter, Savage, etal. I view myself and others who stand for the truth as the real patriots in this battle for the hearts and minds of Americans. Insannity proudly waves the symbols of our great country. Liberals proudly stand for the principles of our great country. I'll take product over packaging any day.<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com	2005-04-02

However I was wrong.  A lobotomy would only get me half-way to where the historically challenged but histrionically adept Ann Coulter gets in her book \\"Treason.\\"  So Schesinger, Keegan, Fallows, and every other notable historian have it all wrong and are part of some liberal conspiracy.  Coulter reminds me of the lady watching a marching band go down the street exclaiming \\"look at my Georgie, he's the only one in step.\\"<br /><br />Trying with minimal talent to re-write history to fit a model that conforms to her corporate sponsors, Coulter sacrifices all virtue and honesty for a roll in the hay with the angry white male who is so embarrassingly willing to accept her offering letting her lead throughout the process. \\"Ummmh, yes Ann, take me you vixen.\\"<br /><br />First of all, calling anyone who doesn't subscribe to Coulter's narrow and ill-supported historical views as TREASONOUS is offensive to me and people a hell of alot more learned than this Bush lap-dog bimbo.  I cannot tell you how glad I am Coulter is not a liberal.  I've watched Cliff Claven show a better grasp of the facts than Coulter.  I still have faith that Americans are basically decent, intelligent people.  If that hypothesis holds true, Coulter shall eventually find herself about as popular as a fart on a crowded elevator.  If she continues her success, I shall embarrassedly stand corrected.<br /><br />For all you white angry conservowussies, I have one message.  Take off the pink nightie and get a grip. You are being played like an accordian.  Wake up before our democracy has gone by-by and you have become eunichs in a new dynastic corporocult of the righteous. Be afraid.

Here is a parable that should help people understand Mormonism as projected in this book.<br /><br />I give you a mortgage of $1,000/month.  I also employ you and give you a $1,000/month salary.  Recognizing your human frailties, i.e., the need for food and clothing, you can't quite make the full payment.  You come on hands and knees and ask for forgiveness.  I look down on you with pity, and agree to let you go by for another month, however I start charging you penalty and interest on your deficiency.<br /><br />After a while, you start getting really down on yourself, because you are continually in my debt, and you feel guilty because this human frailty of yours makes it so you can't meet your obligations to me.  Once a week, I stand before you and others who owe me money and give you a pep talk about how to overcome your frailty.  You start each week with a renewed commitment to overcome your human frailties, but by Tuesday morning, you've eaten again and bought some socks and shoes because of the frostbite is turning your toes black.<br /><br />Broken and demoralized, you get farther and farther in debt and continue to have people telling you how unworthy you are because you are so far in debt to me.  Every once in a while, I throw you a bone or two and praise you for your efforts.  However, you are now living in a dark and tired world of dependence.<br /><br />If this sort of existence appeals to you, I can give you a number to call for your free Book of Mormon and Mormon missionaries will personally deliver one.  There are good things about Mormons and Mormonism, don't get me wrong.  However, you will live a life of spiritual, physical and intellectual dependence to some myopic old men who practice therapy without a license or even a modicum of revelation.<br /><br />Spencer W. Kimball meant well.  But he believed his own myths and wrote one of the most devestating books in religious history.  This book has caused people to take their own lives out of despair and self-loathing.

However, the descriptions of the people and tactics of this fateful battle are definately worth the time and money.  One of the most important turning points, not only in military history, but in the history of the 20th Century, the Wehrmacht found itself mired in a desperate struggle for a secondary target of only symbolic value.<br /><br />Beevor, unlike propagandists for either side, objectively examines the events and the people and how they demonstrated a combination of courage, cowardice and despair.  Looking at the soldiers as real people, not just pawns in a global battle of attrition, Beevor adds a human element to this monumental struggle that is very appealing.<br /><br />This battle was unintended but important.  The German goal of acquiring the oil fields of the Caucuses required the protection of a long flank along the Don and Volga rivers.  Stalingrad on the Volga was the most important linchpin in that flank and the failure of the Germans to capture and hold this city changed the course of events on the eastern front.<br /><br />The ingenuity and tenacity of the Russian defense in ruins of Stalingrad gave the Red Army the confidence that they could defeat the Wehrmacht.  This alone made the victory in Stalingrad vitally important.  The counterattact along the Don and Volga and the encirclement of the German 6th and most of the 4th Panzer Army changed the fortunes on the eastern front for good.  Beevor's finely crafted book tells a story that is compelling on many levels.  It examines the motives and the tactics of both parties to this struggle in excellent detail.<br /><br />Tremendous thanks should be given to Beevor for putting together this timely book.  As the WWII generation ages and passes away, any information that can be gleamed from the survivors of this terrible conflict is extremely valuable.  The events at Stalingrad had global impacts that influence us today.<br /><br />If the Soviets had not acheived what they did on the eastern front, many of us Americans would have never been born, because our progenitors would have died fighting back the same troops that Soviet troops defeated.  We owe the courage and determination of the brave soldiers of the 62nd and 64th armies, as well as the counterattacking Russian forces that doomed the German Wehrmacht along the Volga.

Mormons believe that Joseph Smith was called to restore the gospel of Jesus Christ as it was founded by Christ and his apostles.  Though the premise Talmadge starts with is false, Talmadge makes a compelling case against early Christianity.  The thesis Talmadge offers is that forces of persecution as well as communication difficulties in the ancient world greatly hampered the spread of the church founded by Christ.  The Catholic church, by Talmadge's argument, bastardized the original church by incorporating pagan ideas from the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures.<br /><br />The fault with the premise is that there was some idealic church founded by one Jesus Christ.  Talmage never makes a strong case for what the \\"true\\" ancient church looked like.  One would think that since Jesus would have founded a church that was a precursor of Mormonism, that you would find such things as polygamy, baptism for the dead, stake presidents, seventies, patriarchs, etc.  Restoring an ill-defined past to a poorly conceived present is problematic at best.<br /><br />Even so, Talmadge does a good job of selecting evidence that supports his thesis and puts a spin on it that helps current latter day saints feel like they have an exclusive hold on the truth.  Or as I used to think, \\"If a man as smart as James Talmage believes in this stuff, it must be true.\\"<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com	2005-03-13

Failure of the government to promote their agenda is treason, an assault on Gawd, and &lt;gulp> Un-American.  Like all conservative commentators, his first tactic is to create a liberal straw man, and then through a policy of \\"Shock and Awe\\" look credulously at the straw man and say, \\"WHO COULD BELIEVE THESE IDIOTS.\\"<br /><br />Like Rush \\"The Opiate\\" Limbaugh, his penchant for accuracy is, shall we say, suspect.  An entire chapter in the \\"I Hate Ann Coulter...Reader\\" is devoted to this guy and his web of deceit. Unlike Limbaugh, there is no pretense of civility, just wussy boy rage from the right. Savage appeals to the worst instincts of Americans, particularly the angry white male, who for some reason keeps fearing the loss of his y chromosome.  The success of people like Savage doesn't speak well for our education system and for the intellectual health of our Republic.<br /><br />For the educated moderates out there, I suggest you read Savage's book because you will be able to see just how dark and pathetic things are out there in red state heaven.  For those who buy into Savage's bullcookies, I'd suggest you change therapists or perhaps look into getting one.<br /><br />(...)	2005-03-09

Bush	Books	5	18	27	N	N	Devastating critique of Bush's ethics	The author better explains Bush's behavior than any other book I have read.  A man whose ethics seem to be based upon a combination of gut instinct and self-interest is an interesting study and Singer's study of George W. Bush is interesting and alarming.  Painting Bush as having the emotional maturity of a teenager probably won't win Singer many friends on Fox(Pravda)News and other propaganda ministries, but it explains Bush's behavior better than any other explanation.  I once heard Jeff Foxworthy define a redneck as \\"someone with a complete lack of sophistication.\\"  That in a nutshell (so to speak) is our President.<br /><br />In the preface to the book, Singer talks about the failure of Bush to admit a single mistake.  That discussion was very enlightening.  Like a teenage boy, whose manhood is internally questioned at every turn, Bush can't admit fallability.  His psyche is too tender to face the possibility that he is wrong.  These are the disturbing signs of a man with significant mental problems.  We just put the junior high bully in as President for a second term.  A nation stunned by the insecurity of 9/11 turned to an insecure, immature fellow to lead us because he sounded sure of himself, just like many teenage boy is like to do.<br /><br />Americans owe Singer a big favor for writing this book.  This book tries to give Bush the benefit of the doubt when I've thrown in the towel and decided the man is a mess.

Putting Watergate into the wider context of an administration and President that is paranoid about secrecy, all the while taping his personal conversations.  This book provides important details about all the major players in this drama from the powerful Haldeman, the petulant Gordon Liddy to the aspiring young attorney John Dean, there is an abundance of interesting drama in this tale, and you have to remind yourself that this actually happened. The new chapter of this book in hopefully a next edition will deal with the role played by \\"Deep Throat\\" Mark Felt of the FBI.<br /><br />One of the more disturbing scenes for me in this book is the vote by the Congressional sub-committee for impeachment.  Looking at the damning evidence that Nixon clearly obstructed justice, there were still numerous Republicans voting no for impeachment, among them a young congressman named Trent Lott.  His sanctimonious blustering in the Clinton impeachment proceedings made my skin crawl knowing his own hypocrisy.<br /><br />Anyone interested in American history should have this book in their collection.	2005-03-05

With all the accuracy of a scud missile, Coulter uses broad generalizations to paint a picture of liberals that is laughable.  \\"Liberals hate America.\\" \\"Liberals hate The flag.\\"  \\"Liberals hate Christ.\\" \\"Liberals make coats out of dalmation puppies.\\" Blah, blah, blah.  What is a liberal you might ask?  Well, pretty much anyone who disagrees with Ann Coulter.  Now figuring out what Coulter actually believes may be a bit of a challenge.  I'm not sure what she really wants because she seems to be opposed to things but isn't in favor of much other than being the current administration's lap dog.  Coulter projects to liberals the things that she deep down sees in herself in this book.  This book is an interesting psychological study about \\"Narcissist Personality Disorder\\" because Coulter is a classic case (see the definition in DSM IV and decide for yourself).

This was an inevitable conflict due to a sovereign King of England also having a Lordship over Gascony, a title held when King Henry II married Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine.  With Edward III having a legitimate claim to the throne of France through his mother Isabella, Seward's book tells the story of the off and on conflicts that occured from 1337-1453.<br /><br />Early in the conflict, with victories at Slurs, Crecy and Poitiers, the French became aware of the fact that they could not defeat the English forces in the field.  However, though the English were capable of conquering territories, they never possessed the strength to hold them indefinately.  Seward does a good job of putting the reader in the shoes of the main characters, from the proud but unlucky Philip VI, to the crazy mental patient known as Charles VI.  He also gives a good biographical sketch of English monarchs and princes during this period, from Edward \\"the Black Prince\\", to John of Gaunt's militarily incompentent bastard granchildren, the Beaufort brothers John and Edmund.<br /><br />Seward gives a historically accurate portrayal of English hero Henry V that is a far cry from the anglo-centric version we all know through Shakespeare.  A man with a tenuous claim to the throne of England invaded France and nearly became the King of France.  The atrocities he committed are repugnant, even by the standards of the day and should include him with other evil despots who have ruled through terror and murder.  After Henry V's death, despite the competence of his brother the Duke of Bedford, England was doomed to a protracted conflict when the young religious fanatic Joan of Arc decided she was called by God to evict the English from France.<br /><br />Seward does a good job of viewing the conflict from the perspective of the French peasant, who suffered mightily under the oppression of English rule and the anarchy that existed in the conquered lands.  He also details how the loss of the alliance with Burgundy, coupled with the ending of the minority of the incompetent Henry VI doomed England and precipitated the Wars of the Roses.<br /><br />This is a fascinating period of time in English history that impacted greatly the history of the world.  One of the most significant conflicts that shaped the modern world, I highly recommend this book as an overview of the period.of English rule and the anarchy that existed in the conquered lands.

The perspectives of the Earl of Oxford and Margaret Beaufort are especially effective.  The book is effective in helping you understand the changing loyalties and underlying basis for the conflicts.<br /><br />For a better reading of the events prior to the battles between Lancaster and York, I suggest reading Seward's other book \\"The Hundred Year's War.\\"  Also read Weir's \\"Wars of the Roses\\" for some details that Seward doesn't cover.  Seward's book is about people and how they were affected by the war.  There are better books out there that give details that this book doesn't dive into.  However, there are some unique perspectives in this book that are worth examining and effectively put you back in the 15th Century where the events were occuring.	2005-03-04

Disagreements on what happened continue to this day and it sometimes seems that the battle between Lancaster and York continues into this century.  Clearly, Weir sides with the Lancastrians in this book and accepts the most unflattering image of Richard III that Tudor apologists hold dear.<br /><br />Certainly, the weight of the evidence suggests that Richard III was responsible for the deaths of Edward IV's sons.  However, Weir's sloppy use of the evidence and grand speculations don't add much to the debate.  However, because Weir is such an effective story teller, many people will probably accept the evidence in this book without realizing their is evidence that could support other hypotheses.<br /><br />Even so, Weir does a good job of engaging the reader into the sorbid tale of dynastic struggle and murder mystery.  If I were a betting man, I'd put money on Richard III being the main person responsible for the sad deaths of the two boys.  However, I suggest readers who are interested to keep an open mind and not take Weir's book as established fact.	2005-03-02

With such absurdity over there in la la land, it's healthy to laugh at it because the only other option is to break down and cry.  Franken does a good job of catching neocons lying like cons and then smugly shrugging their shoulders.  Franken exposes the mainstream press as beaten and incompetent, a far cry from the myth proposed by the \\"righteous\\" that the media is liberally biased.<br /><br />Franken obviously has his favorite whipping boys/girl.  Sean Insannity, Rush Limberger, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, FoxNews and Karl Rover provide so many examples of deceit that it is hard to know where to begin.  Franken does what others have done and caught our illustrious President telling some real whoppers during his ascendency to the top of the manure pile.  Historians 200 years from now will look upon this President as one of the worst and most corrupt Presidents in the history of this Republic.<br /><br />I think my favorite chapter in this book is when Franken bitch-slaps Bernard Goldberg.  I imagine that exchange is one that Goldberg would very much like to forget. Nothing worse than having your lies exposed on national TV.  I also liked the cartoon \\"Supply-side Jesus\\".  A hilarious reminder that conservatives don't worship the Christ of the New Testament, but a Christ turned Pharisee, can you say \\"Hallelujah?\\"<br /><br />One part of the book I found disappointing was Franken's ruse to have his staffer apply at Bob Jones University (BJU).  Nothing in his encounter at BJU really added much to the book and showed, what most of us already know, that Christians are nice, decent people.  The \\"disciplitis\\" they suffer from isn't really all that funny, just sort of sad.<br /><br />Another really funny part of the book details the suit by Foxnews over the title of this book.  Bill O'Reilly is a hoot as he pushes Fox to sue Franken and then denies he had anything to do with it.  The suit was literally, not figuratively, laughed out of court.  How precious is that. So the latest edition gets more examples of lying from these morality defenders out there among the \\"righteous\\".  Now that is choice.

I know with all the fiber in my bean, that the Book of Marmon is bad fiction written by as B.H. Roberts asserted, \\"an immature mind.\\"  Yes, I post boldly and with the spirit of reason to you today, that this book has changed the lives of many people.  For this book has inspired people to believe that because they are \\"white and delightsome\\", that they are a chosen and peculiar people.  This book solemnly affirms that God regularly punishes the wicked and the unbeliever with dark skin.<br /><br />This book also inspired acts of violence in the name of the lord.  Just as Nephi understood, that \\"better one man should perish, than an entire nation dwindle in unbelief\\", many other Mormons have taken the matter into their own hands.  From the second biggest religious terrorist attack in our nation's history at Mountain Meadows, to the killing of perceived apostates by Porter Rockwell, Bill Hickman, Hosea Stout, and Dan Lafferty, this book has stood as the inspirational anthem of blood atonement.<br /><br />Yes, I testify that this book has inspired many people to better themselves.  A common theme in this book is that God blesses the righteous with economic prosperity, but then punishes them with economic hardship when they turn away from the Lord.  It makes me feel so superior to know that the less fortunate should have been more valiant in the pre-existence.  .<br /><br />I will bear witness to you that the Book of Marmon has been found to help many people who suffer with the heartbreak and fatigue of insomnia.  Even the great author Mark Twain realized the medical value of this book when he called it \\"chloroform in print.\\" 2 Nephi by itself has given hope to those suffering from this crippling sleeping disorder.  This is the reason for the two star rating.<br /><br />I also testify, that this book testifies of Jesus Christ.  In this book, those who rejected his glad message were destroyed in earthquakes, floods and other disasters.  You think Jesus was pissed at the moneychangers in the temple?  Check out his wrath in 3 Nephi.  Reminds me of an old primary song \\"Jesus wants me for a Sunbeam\\" but my version would go \\"Jesus killed me in an earthQUAKE, because I wasn't good....\\"  Yes this Jesus fellow sure made an entrance. The message is, \\"believe in me, or I'll show you who's boss.<br /><br />Let me say in closing, that I know without a shadow of a doubt, that Joseph Smith wrote this book. My testimonkey grows stronger every day that Joseph Smith was a philandering con-man who had a thing for underage women.  I know with all my heart that the current profit is running from his church's history in order to sound mainstream.

And now he still selling books from the grave, challenging us to reach our potential.  I remember well how inspiring his war stories were.  How he gave up a professional baseball career (a lie).  How he nearly single-handedly defeated the Japanese(yeah right), and how his best friend died in his arms (only to resurface decades later alive and well).  Those stories inspired young men of so many stripes to dedicate their lives to the Mormon church.  As a Mormon missionary, I baptized two young men who were strongly influenced by the lies of Paul H. Dunn.<br /><br />Of course, we were all deceived by the lies of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, et al.  Paul H. Dunn learned from the experience of those in the hierarchy and made a killing selling books on the basis of fictitious war stories.  Though not a pioneer in selling fiction as truth, he learned from Joseph Smith that a good lie often inspires people better than the boring truth.  What I find interesting, is how many Mormons truly believe that he did a good thing by inspiring so many.  I guess the ends justify the means.	2005-02-13

Ezra Taft Benson was a passionate believer in Mormonism, American imperialism, the teachings of the John Birch Society and in the belief that the founding fathers created the U.S. Constitution out of divine inspiration.<br /><br />This particular book does a good job of summarizing the many teachings of Ezra Taft Benson. The basic teachings of Ezra taft Benson are:<br /><br />1- Mormonism is God's Plan and America was created for the furtherance of that plan<br />2- Communism is Satan's Plan<br />3- Creeping socialism will ultimately lead to communism<br />4- The Book of Mormon is a real record of native americans that shows us the way to live<br />5- As part of God's plan, the U.S. Constitution and strict interpretation of it is the main means by which Satan's plan will be thwarted.<br /><br />Given that the Book of Mormon is a profoundly racist document where God curses the wicked with dark skin but turns their skin white again after they become faithful, using that book as a capstone to your religion is a dangerous matter.  One aspect of the Book of Mormon that has provided paranoia to Mormons and made the red scare tactics of Joe McCarthy resonate with Mormon was the discussion of \\"secret combinations\\" and the \\"gadianton robbers.\\"  Ezra Taft Benson bought into that stuff hook line and sinker and dragged down many zealots with him into the dark paranoid world of conspiracies and evil just under the surface.<br /><br />As for the U.S. Constitution, like many others right wing nut-jobs, it is usually a veiled belief in states rights and in making America a land not for diversity, but conformity to a particular world view.<br /><br />For a better understanding of Ezra Taft Benson and what he stood for and what his impact was on the Mormon religion, please read \\"Mormon Hierarchy, Extensions of Power\\" by D. Michael Quinn.  He devotes an entire chapter to Ezra Taft Benson that is enlightening as well as frightening.<br /><br />Those who follow Ezra Taft Benson to the letter just might find themselves quitting Mormonism to become \\"real\\" mormons ironically living in a communal lifestyle in Colorado City.Taft Benson to the letter just might find themselves quitting Mormonism to become \\"real\\" mormons ironically living in a communal lifestyle in Colorado City.	2005-02-11

This book is really several books compiled together and I agree with one reviewer that the first one is the weakest of the group.<br /><br />That being said, McPhee makes geology so accessible and interesting to the novice, that I whole-heartedly recommend his books.  Geology is a fascinating subject that doesn't get enough accessible writing for those interested in science who don't possess a college degree in a scientific discipline.  McFee hasn't completely plugged the gap, but has slowed the flow.  I hope other authors step forward and give us what we want.  Good reading geologic history of our planet.	2005-02-05

Having been raised a Mormon, having served a mission and having served in many callings, I remember looking forward to the day when the scientific evidence would finally come in to show that Joseph Smith didn't just make up the Book of Mormon.<br /><br />However, all the evidence to date has pointed to native americans descending from people in the far east, not the middle east.  Southerton's book does a masterful job of showing just how compelling the evidence is.  It also explains what the implications are for the LDS Church and it's members.  Southerton leaves the door open for people to believe that the LDS faith is worthwhile and can provide meaning in their lives.  However, so many leaders of the church staked the church's divinity on the truth claims of the Book of Mormon, giving in to the scientific evidence would be like George W. Bush proposing the biggest tax increase in history.<br /><br />For those who might look at the negative reviews, also check out the other reviews written by these reviewers.  In particular, their canned testimonies of the Book of Mormon speaks volumes as to their credibility in evaluating Southerton's book.  Their mythologies are being attacked by the scary evidence Southerton lays out and their reviews don't speak much about Southerton's book, but about the reviewers themselves.<br /><br />I learned a great deal from this book about mitochondrial and y chromosomal DNA.  This book also fills in details about the dispersal of mankind from Africa.  Even if Mormonism is irrelevant to you, this book contains some really interesting information.  Southerton does an especially good job of explaining scientific concepts to non-scientists.  I hope this book gains a wider audience than those who are interested in evidence against Mormon scriptural claims.  One of the most interesting books I've read all year.

However Futuyma does an excellent job of showing the clash between two world views and why creationism should never be taught as science in the classroom.  Simply because it isn't science.<br /><br />One thing I enjoyed in the book was how the author showed that people who can acknowledge Darwin was right, can still live a moral, decent life in harmony with others.  Darwinism was misused by many who focused on the \\"survival of the fittest\\" theme whereas Darwinism brings humans into the great biological family that is all life on our planet.  Humanity is no longer a battle against nature, but is man as a part of nature with interdependencies and symbiotic relationships that should be embraced and celebrated.<br /><br />The sad reality is, that the creation myths are so vital to Christian Fundamentalism and the idea that Jesus died to save us from Adam's fall, that true believers of Christianity will cling to these irrational beliefs regardless what the evidence tells them.  Even so, giving into fundamentalism and rejecting science will bring us into the intellectual darkness you see in the middle east.<br /><br />Futuyma was one of the first courageous souls to stand up and do battle with the fundamentalists on this battleground.  Reason and science owe him a big debt for this book. I'm glad other scientists have stepped forward to defend the application of the scientific method against the forces promoting superstition.<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com	2005-01-23

It effectively outlines the fact that the Wehrmacht had competing theories on how to effectively invade a country and the thesis seems to be that had they had a more definitive strategy and kept with it, they might have defeated the Soviet Union.  I don't entirely agree with that thesis but that is besides the point.<br /><br />Clearly the first half of the book is the best part.  After the battle of Stalingrad and the great lengths to which the Wehrmacht tried to stabilize their southern wing, the book focuses on the Battle of Kursk and the mindset that led up to it.  The book then descends into a cursory look at the mindset of the principal actors on the German side.<br /><br />Little is said (maybe nothing) of the Bagration offensive that decimated Army Group Center, an event that coincided with Hitler's brush with death from a bomb plot and probably shortened the war in europe by a year.<br /><br />There are some moments in the second half that are interesting as Guderian has to try to maintain a cohesive defense in the face of increasing emotional instability among those around him.  Overall, it is a fair look at the war on the Eastern Front, but students of World War II will find it lacking on many levels.  Even so, it is a worthwhile read.	2005-01-23

People who use Smith to justify unimpeded laissez faire \\"survival of the fittest\\" philosophies would be well served by seeing Smith in his proper perspective.<br /><br />On some fronts, I didn't know whether some claims were accurate such as the southern term for \\"rednecks\\" and others.

Her treatment of Henry V, whom I consider a brutal war criminal even by the standards of the day, is shall we say kind.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the book is the ability place the Wars of the Roses in the context of preceding events.  The recap of the Hundred Years War, the role of Edward III's sons and grandsons and great grandsons is very helpful.<br /><br />The book does end at an awkward time, as Richard III's assuming the throne is left to \\"The Princes in the Tower.\\"  I view the ending of the Lancastrian and Yorkists disputes finally put to rest in the reign of Henry VIII, rather than at the Battle of Tewkesbury.<br /><br />All in all, a very good book and the author as always should be thanked for making these historical figures so interesting and accessible.	2005-01-15

Eleanor is a remarkable woman, having been queen to two different countries, but a power in her own right through her title in Aquitaine.<br /><br />Interesting to see a woman with any power during this period of patriarchal control, but the strength of her personality contributed to era in remarkable ways.<br /><br />Like all of Weir's books, there sometimes develop something bordering on personality cults with historical figures.  Even so, the author gave a fair treatment of Eleanor's misbehavior on the crusade with her first husband King Louis.<br /><br />As always, Weir's greatest contribution is her making historical figures accessible and personal.  If her sympathetic writing may overstate a case here and there, her writing certainly helps spawn interest in people who have been gone for hundreds of years.	2005-01-15

The author uses a language which seems natural to the age and writes of the personalities with genuine admiration and affection as if they had been to dinner with him on Sunday.<br /><br />Shelby Foote's interesting writing style of an interesting yet tragic event in our history is a remarkable accomplishment.  Every American should have these books as part of their home library.	2005-01-12

Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	4	37	38	N	N	Overall a pretty good book	Though I think the author overstates some things in the book, it is effective in showing a pattern of deception with George W. Bush that preceded his advent to the Whitehouse and characterizes his administration today.<br /><br />What is most alarming about the book is the lesson that lying actually can work.  With a propaganda machine of neocon pundits running interference for him, this President has taken more liberties with the truth than even Nixon.<br /><br />One thing that would have greatly strengthened the book was the use of footnotes.  I find it likely that the author has good sources for his statements, but the lack of footnotes severely weakens book as a means of clearly showing the lies told by George W. Bush.	2005-01-12

With chapters on most of the major Bach composers, I found the chapters on J.S. Bach, C.P.E. Bach and W.F. Bach especially interesting.<br /><br />There are also some valuable biographies of earlier Bach's such as Johann Christoph Bach, a contemporary with Pachabel and Johann Michael Bach, the father-in-law of Johann Sebastion.<br /><br />With each composer, a comprehensive list is provided of the extant as well as compositions known to have been composed but are apparently lost.<br /><br />Anyone wanting to understand music in Germany during the baroque era will want to check out this book.	2005-01-12

This book opens up to readers a compelling glimpse of the remarkable acheivement of the Soviet army.	2005-01-12

Perhaps giving too little credit to transitional composers who blazed the trail for these three geniuses, Rosen intersperses analysis with superlatives that at times is useful but at other times seems more like hero worship.<br /><br />I found some parts particularly fascinating, such as the comparison between a work by Haydn and C.P.E. Bach.  Certainly when the analysis was complete, you could see why Haydn's art was more rational and complete, however Rosen's dismissal of C.P.E. Bach's work as incoherent was somewhat off base in my opinion because the styles and goals of the two composers were not synonymous.<br /><br />Though I didn't always agree with the author's conclusions, this book is still the best out there that I have read on the subject and is well worth reading.	2005-01-12

He moved to Kilmarnock as a teenager and began making a living as both a weaver and newspaper reporter. Largely self-taught, John Lyon began intellectual quests that would take him to Mormonism and eventually the Great Basin.<br /><br />This book is a very interesting biography in that it provides some perspective on Scotland in the early 1800's, still under the influence of the Scottish enlightenment but also filled with religious fervor, all amidst the economic upheavel of industrialization.<br /><br />Most notably, Lyon is a poet.  He uses his poetry to discuss and promote his new found religion.  He also uses his poetry as a means of acknowledging and thanking people who have made sacrifices in his behalf.  Poetry to Lyon is his gift to his friends, his religion and as a pure means of self-expression.<br /><br />As Lyon enters the Great Basin and becomes friends with leading Mormon church officials, he uses his poetry and writing in newspaper publications all the while engaging in the weaving trade in Utah Territory.  He also brings to Seventies Quorum meetings a tradition from the Scottish enlightenment of discussing difficult philosophical issues and to promote intellectual discussion.<br /><br />One interesting note from the book is a poem where he as covertly as possible pokes fun at polygamy.  Ironically, as a man approaching old age, Lyon takes a teenage wife, a questionable but common practice in the Mormonism of the 19th century.<br /><br />Though this book will likely find a limited audience, it is an interesting story about how a poor boy from Scotland took an amazing intellectual, spiritual and physical journey.  A small piece of the Scottish diaspora, an interesting one never the less.<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com	2005-01-12

Reader: The Hideous Truth About America's Ugliest Conservatives ("I Hate" Series, The)	Books	5	32	70	N	N	Good job of exposing the right wing pundits lack of honesty	The word hate is a little strong but obviously meant for effect.  The essays in the book expose Ann Coulter and her fellow neocon propagandists for what they really are.  Coulter, Insannity, Savage, etal. among the conservative pundits get their due in this book.  I especially enjoyed the section where Kristol gets exposed as nothing more than a pseudo-intellectual chump for idiotic neocons who forgot how to think for themselves.<br /><br />I especially enjoy the negative reviewers of this book. My guess is that the negative reviewers didn't even read the book and never will.  But Americans who take seriously their civic responsibilities and really want to know who is atleast trying to be objective and who is trying to turn you into someone suffering from right-wing disciplitis, read this book and then read Coulter and judge for yourself. Coulter's books are liberalisms greatest allies.  If you have a half hour, read through them at the local Barnes and Noble.	2005-01-12

Talmadge has an Edward O. Wilsonesque vocabulary so a dictionary is welcome at times.  Talmage's style is pretty erudite but to the point.  More succinct and authoritative than the Book of Mormon or the Doctrine and Covenants, this book gives a fairly clear perspective on how Mormons view Jesus Christ.  Any so-called Christians who want to understand Mormonism and how they perceive the role of Jesus Christ, this is their textook.<br /><br />Mainstream Christians will likely find differences between their religious dogmas and those proposed by Talmadge, but to Mormons or anyone who wants to understand the Mormon perspective, this is a valuable book.<br /><br />Talmadge takes some liberties when interpreting historical phenomenom.  As in other Talmadge books such as \\"The Great Apostasy\\" historical evidence is generally presented in a way designed to prove Mormonism's claims when other more plausible interpretations are present.  But this is expected from a book written for Mormons by a Mormon.<br /><br />All in all, a remarkable accomplishment among literary Mormons. Though not considered scripture by Mormons, it provides greater clarity than any scripture on the perception of Jesus the Christ and his significance and role in the plan of salvation than any other Mormon source including \\"Mormon Doctrince\\" by Bruce R. McConkie.	2005-01-12

Parkinson, but providing an exhaustive look at his descendents through SRP's great grandchildren.<br /><br />The story of Samuel Rose Parkinson is an interesting one as he travels around the world with his mother and step-father and ultimately settling in the St. Louis area.  Becoming converted to Mormonism, he travels to the Utah territory and ultimately helps in the settlement of Franklin Idaho, Idaho's first permanent settlement.  Samuel like many prominent Mormons practices plural marriage and takes two teenage sisters as his plural wives.<br /><br />With grandchildren older than some of the younger children of his plural wives, the family expands and ultimately grows to the hundreds and thousands throughout the United States but centered in the Great Basin.  Descendents include a Congressman, many business and civic leaders, humble farmers and even the radical, profane author Chandler Brossard.<br /><br />In a book this volumninous, there are opportunties for errors.  Some of the pictures don't match up to the right descendent (one picture is used for two different descendents)and there are some other flaws.  But the author well into his nineties when he finished this book (and died shortly thereafter) did his extended family a great service by finishing this book.<br /><br />Often, the biographies of descendents are discussed relevant to their activity as a member of the Mormon faith and accomplishments outside the church are sometimes relegated to secondary status.  This belies the faith of the author and the value placed upon such activity.<br /><br />Also, some potentially embarrassing yet important omissions were left out of the book such as Samuel's daughter Luella Parkinson Cowley's husband Mathias's resignation from the quorum of the twelve for his role in post-manifesto polygamy.  This is interesting given that the author is open about the fact that he was a child of a post-manifesto polygamous marriage between his father George Chandler Parkinson and Fannie Woolley, the aunt of former Mormon prophet Spencer W. Kimball.  I would have been interested to know how the extended family reacted to Mathias Cowley's resignation and disfellowship.<br /><br />Even with the book's flaws, this is a valuable book for descendents of this remarkable pioneer.<br /><br />The book is hard to come by, but anyone interested in getting a copy of the book, I recommend checking out the following link.<br /><br />[...]ous marriage between his father George Chandler Parkinson and Fannie Woolley, the aunt of former Mormon prophet Spencer W.

The sad reality is that people whose search for truth is based upon faith, will struggle with science because the world views are so different.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I thought the author was effective on several levels at explaining the different and contradictory factions within the \\"Creation Science\\" community.  The thing that distinguishes them is how much of the biblical story they are willing to give up to preserve even the impression that they are scientists.<br /><br />Obviously young earth creationists have the most difficulty and are the easiest to dismiss.  However those pushing the Intelligent Design theories can be dismissed with a little more thought and analysis.<br /><br />The author's analogous use of linguistic evolution to organic evolution and the implications to the mythical \\"Tower of Babel\\" is certainly effective.  A reason why linguists don't get the ire of Christians is that the Tower is not as central to their mythology as the creation is.  The Christ of the New Testament came to redeem Adam and his posterity for his fall in the garden.  Rejecting the creation story has far reaching implications for Christians and is why Darwinian evolution is so threatening to their belief system.<br /><br />Scientists owe people like Pennock a big thank you.  Unfortunately, scientists go on doing science forgetting that society may not care what the evidence leads to.  The implications for the United States was appropriately discussed by the author and gives cause for real concern regarding science education in this country.<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com	2005-01-12

In reading the book, I felt the author tried to paint a sympathetic picture of church leadership and the challenges they faced.  However, with the church's current focus on blind obedience and the building of personality cults around past church leaders, it isn't surprising that some reviewers find offense with the book and will try to discredit it by nitpicking an inaccuracy here or there.<br /><br />Reading the book, it looked like a series of essays to me.  One of the most interesting of the essays was the chapter on Ezra Taft Benson and his attempts at directing the membership of the church towards the extreme right-wing doctrines of the John Birch Society.  His success is illustrated in Utah and Mormon areas of Idaho and Arizona being some of the most Republican in the nation.  In this regard, this book is relevant to anyone wanting to understand the current demographics and attitudes of church members and how they evolved.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the book is the huge appendix.  Any student of Mormon history will find it very helpful and interesting.<br /><br />Dr. Quinn is to be commended for his wonderful book.	2005-01-11

Focusing on the Lafferty brothers and the murder of their sister in law and neice, the book shows the evolution not only of the Laffertys but of Mormon fundamentalism from the violent 19th Century religion that settled in the Great Basin and whose remnants continue to practice polygamy, have a profound distrust of the government, and use cultural control mechanisms resembling the Taliban in Afghanistan.<br /><br />The author as his thesis statement seems to be focusing on the dangers of using revelation and spirualism as a means of interpreting reality and discovering truth.  Certainly the Lafferty brothers believed that God wanted them to kill just as the terrorists who flew aircraft into the Trade Center believe they would gain their eternal reward.<br /><br />There were some minor inaccuracies in the book such as mistating Mark E. Peterson's position in the church and discussion concerning Elizabeth Smart being aware of temple robes were off base.  I would also have liked to see a better link between the modern LDS Church and the fundamentalist attitudes.  Many LDS members are closer to fundamentalism in their attitudes and prejudices than the modern leadership would like to admit.<br /><br />To the author's credit, he adds criticisms to his first edition from Richard Turley of the LDS Church and answers those criticisms point by point.  Ultimately, Turley ends up sounding pretty petty and childish even as the author acknowledges some mistakes and corrects them.  Turley accuses the author of having an agenda which was the equivalent of throwing rocks in to a mirror.<br /><br />One element that the author could have used in the book was how those most strident Mormons are vulnerable to fundamentalism and violence.  The doctrines of Ezra Taft Benson and the teachings of Cleon Skousen, widely revered by mainstream Mormons, brought many Mormons close to this dark neverland of extremism and fundamentalism.  Mormon leaders have a tiger by the tail, wanting to inspire devotion, without letting that devotion get out of hand.and of extremism and fundamentalism.

At the time Joseph wrote this book, there was both in America as well as Europe a trend to idealize past societies and James MacPherson's Ossian legends he wrote in Scotland were an early example.  Joseph Smith was much influenced by Solomon Spaulding, who like many people were influenced by the Ossian legends.  The Book of Mormon is a purported history of native americans, postulating that they were descendents of the inhabitants of Israel, descending from a prophet named Lehi.  In general, the protagonists in Joseph's book end in \\"i\\" (eye) such as Lehi, Nephi, Moroni, etc.  Many of the antagonists end in \\"hor\\" such as \\"Corihor\\", \\"Nehor\\", etc.<br /><br />An over-riding theme of the book is the early nineteenth century wisdom that \\"pride preceeds the fall.\\"  Many stories within the book talk about a humble people gaining wealth through their righteousness only to turn against God and to become prideful.  This pridefulness results in their downfall and only becoming humble again results in the material and spiritual blessings of God.  This theme is consistent with many New England calvinist philosophies about gaining wealth through righteousness and losing wealth or status through wickedness.<br /><br />This book is important in American literature because of these morality lessons and what they say about America. Those values spread throughout the country in the puritan diaspora of which Mormonism is an important component.<br /><br />No serious scholars actually believe the Book of Mormon to be an actual history of the peoples of the Americas.  DNA, linguistic and other evidence clearly contradicts those claims  (for more information, read \\"Insider's View of Mormon Origins\\" by Grant Palmer).  True believers of the religion will \\"bear testimony\\" with tremendous sincerity and the book plays an important role in their religious life.  But when the book is looked at in the perspective of showing the morals and outlooks of Americans in the early 1800s, it is a significant work for historians to study.  Also, the volume being advertised is very nicely bound with a very attractive cover and will be an attractive addition to your book collection.contradicts those claims  (for more information, read \\"Insider's View of Mormon Origins\\" by Grant Palmer).
