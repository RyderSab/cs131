I found Santiago predictable as it is a slight variation on an old theme.  I did find, however, myself totaly absorbed into it.  I have read the book 4 or 5  times.  The pacing is amazing.  You never reach the point of wishing he  would 'get on' with the story.  And it is very sparse within its framework.   I, myself, love minimalism in the tale.  If it did not have to be in the  story to get you where you were going....it probably is not there.  If you  love Sci-Fi the nget this book.	2000-07-07

I avoided it for years due to the longtime cliche; 'You can't judge a book by it's cover'.  Well judge I did.  I am happy to say I was horribly wrong.  This book is a work of art in my  opinion.  Told from the point of view of the company physician, this takes  The Company into the service of a powerful sorcerer/ess and beyond.  It was  quite refreshing to have the tale told from the point of view from within  rather than without.  Far too many books take a third person omniscient  stance that can be inhibiting to the personal growth of the people the tale  is about.  This book does not fall prey to that.  I would give it a higher  rating if I could	2000-06-01

I was very let down by this.  When I heard they had revised the ever classic original with the PPE instead of the clunky original Magic System I was quite happy.  Then I made some characters in the game to test it. GOD! What a MESS.  The organization, in my opinion,  was horrible.  Hardly any charts for easy flow.  They had text write ups  for the skill bonusing in Weapon Profs...  I was mortified by how hard it  was to find info in it. (I spent 10 minutes looking up somewhere where I  could find Saving Throws for magic...only to discover it was spread out  over a zillion different sections.  Every Section had one little piece of  info about the saving throws.  There was not one place where I could get  all the info about saving throws.  THere was no chart.  I have no problem  with redundant info, but I have a problem with it being scattered all over  the place like that. WE NEED CONSOLIDATION!)  Then, after 6 character  creations, my friends and I battled it out to see how well the new system  worked in actual play.  The characters were horridly unbalanced.  My  Warrior Monk took everyone out due to the Spirit Strike which makes people  drop their weapon.<br />This is not the Palladium Books of Old.  I will never  again purchase a Palladium Product. If I ever PLAY Palladium again I will  dig out my Dusty 'Crimson' Copy. This new one goes to prove the old adage.  New is not necessarily better.	2000-04-18

I wanted to make sure I had something NEW to say. Most of the people here complain of jargon, or that he tossed in too many 'technical' terms. Anyone  ever tried to read A Clockwork Orange? THAT was hard to read.  I read three  pages into it 3-4 times before I understood it. In Neuromancer you know  what is going on, you just have ot exercise that muscle that has atrophied  from television.<br />Imagination.<br />If you want easy to read pulp go read it.   This is a NOVEL about a WORLD DIFFERENT than our own.  People there have  their own ways of speaking.  I think Gibson did a wonderful job in  incorporating the vision of a unique world into his Sprawl works.   Neuromancer is where his finger was on the pulse and made his masterpiece.   It is too bad that the promise he showed there would not follow in his  later works....except perhaps Count Zero.....that came close.  Mona Lisa  overdrive was ALMOST a waste .....almost. So I guess I sum it up in: If you  want your art spoonfed to you look elsewhere. If you have an ACTIVE  imagination and want to use it....read it...It is WORTH it.	2000-01-15

One point I have to dispute to let the reader understand where this is going. Cerebus WILL DIE.  Sim has stated this time and again.  Cerebus, the series, is a life.   Cerebus will die.  The big gaping questions is: &quot;Will anyone LOVE  Cerebus?&quot; Will he die unmourned and unloved?  Or will he learn to  change enough to have someone love him when he dies? I think perhaps it  will simply be 'resolved'. I don't think he will be loved.  I think he will  be content with that though....but we have a way to go yet so my opinion  may change. Minds is Sims way of getting right to the point and MAYBE just  maybe opening Cerebus' eye(s) enough to see that he has to change his self  serving ways.	2000-01-12
