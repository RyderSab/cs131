This is a book that is simultaneously a romance, a story about cultural change and ethnicity, and a story about family and personal discovery.  While there are certain points where all of this is hard to balance and handle with appropriate justice to the complexity of the issues, this is a book that rings true.  The characters are strong and they deal realistically with with real feelings.<br />One of the things I liked very much about this book is that it is a serious story about adults slowly growing and finding their way along in love and feeling very real passion, but it doesn't slip into being gratuitous.  This is one of the things that would make me put this in a &quot;fiction&quot; rather than &quot;romance&quot; category.	2003-05-09

Her story is extraordinary and simultaneously uplifitng and painfully sad.  I was only able to read this book a little bit at a time.  It is a story of personal survival and achievement but also of the pain and loss and inner conflict that can be the cost of that survival.	2003-05-09

The supporting characters are developed in a great deal of detail and they are given the chance to reveal themselves slowly and to help the reader sink into the story, which has many layers and is closely tied to a physical sense to place.<br />This is fundamentally a novel about love and parenthood.  The Deborah and Simon story blends very successfully with the murder investigation here, and this is also a fairly deep study of the dynamics of sex and love.  It wil stay with you for a long time.	2003-05-09

The author does have the characters work together and get to know each other before they actually give in to the passion that they feel for each other.  The equestrian details are also accurate.<br />As with most romances, so of the conflicts that the characters have to work through to live happily every after seem quite contrived.  I wish that wasn't so here, because this is an enjoyable story.  I wish that the strong characters had the sense not to get caught up in the personal conflicts that frustrate them here.	2003-02-11

The author does an excellent job of having the women he chronicles truly become individuals, sometimes very different from their husbands.  He finds ways to bring the early life of future first ladies into his narrative, and he provides clues to the roots of some American icons that I certainly didn't know about--like the reason for the name of the Baby Ruth candy bar, named after Frances and Grover Cleveland's first daughter.<br />This is not a book that reads quickly.  It is comprehensive and careful, and is meant to be savored as a work of history.  I'm looking forward to reading the second volume of this.	2003-02-11

This was fascinating reading--the evolution of the Shakers and the boundary spanning that goes on between the members of the sect and members of the World is thought-provoking.  <br />I understand the author's fascination with the Shakers and her desire to see and participate in their world first-hand.  I also understand her ultimate decision that the Shaker way was not a choice that she could make, but that she took important elements of that way back with her to her very contemporary life.<br />This is an excellent book for those who are interested in America's utopian communities and how the roots of those communites are still present in our America.	2003-01-09

It gives, good basic simple patterns, in multiple sizes, for multiple guages of yarn.  It is not fancy, and it doesn't necessarily give &quot;exciting&quot; patterns, but that is absolutely not the author's intention.  It is a wonderful book for someone who wants to be able to work with handspun yarns or start to do some designing and needs some basic templates to work from.

I guess at this point I don't want to re-enter that debate, although I will tell all of you that I personally strongly oppose the death penalty.<br />The thing that will stay with me about this book is the spare, unflinching, hypnotic tone of the writing.  Helen Prejean has a writing style that will not let the reader look away.  This is just as true when she is writing lists of facts as it is when she is recounting her personal oddyssey.  No matter which side of this debate one personally comes down on, her strength as a person is impossible to negate.  She is painfully honest, reavealing her own human fears and concerns, and recounting her growth as she acknowleges and faces them.<br />This is a book that is hard to leave and will be difficult to forget.	2002-12-17

I will say that Eagle is brave in her choice of issues and plot.  Savannah, her heroine, is a former famous lingerie model who is attempting to recover from a mastectomy.  The physical and psychological issues of cancer &quot;recovery&quot; are important, and I credit Eagle for dealign with them.<br />Clay, the last good man of the title, is a wonderful chracter, as is Claudia, Savannah's daughter.  There are also a range of supporting characters who are vividly drawn.<br />My concern here is that Savannah doesn't come off as a particularly sympathetic character.  I can empathize with her position, and maybe some of what appears to be selfishness or shallowness is supposed to be seen in the context of both her illness and her early life with a mother who emphasiezed her physical beauty to the exception of everything else, but Savannah's behavior to Clay is less than kind.  I wished for better for him, even at the end of the novel.	2002-12-11

This is an excellent, thought-provoking work.  <br />This is a book about the hideous chasm between America's inner city schools and the opportunities that many people believe all Americans have.  (I would add that there are chasms just as broad and deep between weour conception of the opportunties Americans have and our very poor, rural schools as well. )  Cedric Jennings intentionally refuses to take a large part in the world that surrounds Washington D. C's Ballou High School (spending his time with the TV instead of venturing into the drug and violence filled world outside his apartment) but his life at school does not prepare him for the world of Ivy League colleges, where he aspires to go.  One of the most poignant parts of this book for me was Cedric's trip through the Brown University Bookstore, as a new freshman, where he realizes that he does not recognize the authors or subjects of textbook that are suppposed to be easily recognizeable for most well-prepared Americans.  He might as well be in an uncharted land.<br />This is also a revealing book about the ways that our society maintains class differences.  The power of organized religion as a means for maintaining a social status quo is particularly interesting.<br />This is a book that deals with very serious issues but also reads like a novel.  Ron Suskind has done a wonderful job giving us lots of things to think about.	2002-12-11

(I do hestitate to say something like that because I have great respect for writers' autonomy and integrity.) <br />Eileen Goudge is particularly good at descriptions--her house and garden descriptions here are wonderful.

I think this one is a bit weaker than the earlier ones, but entertaining nonetheless.  My main concern here is that the action in this seems a little farfetched.  I know that the time of Jane Austin was much more liberal more women than the Victorian age, but I have a very difficult time imagining that Jane would actually have been able to do all the things that she does here.  Rowing out to a burning prison hulk and nursing French sailers in a military prison seem unlikely, even for a character of Jane's pluck.<br />There is plenty of action here--the story is engaging and the characters are good.

I bought a copy of the book after listening to it on tape first, and her voice echoes through my reading.<br />Emma Graham is a wonderful, rare, twelve year old narrator, perched right on the verge of adulthood.  Her imaginative child self and her growing intuition about the interesting adults in her life sometimes work together here and sometimes battle each other in a fascinating mix.<br />This is also a beautifully lyrical novel that takes place in a world that seems quite timeless.

There are a lot of characters and situations in this novel that are hysterically funny.  This is a very well-paced story, with a wider scope than most of the books in this series.  The thing that touched me the most, though, was Agatha's persistence in wanting James, while also knwoing, on some level, that she isn't comfortable in his world and can't wait to have her own privacy and spact back.  How many of us have to acknowledge having those relationships at some point in our lives--the person we want to have/love so much that we want to ignore how unhappy life with them really makes us?<br />We learn a lot more about Agatha than in the past, and Bill Wong deepens as a character.

I really liked Into the Wilderness a great deal, and I am glad to see her continuing with her interesting characters from that novel in Dawnon a Distant Shore and in this novel.<br />I think my basic concern here is that she tries to do too much in this novel--we have abolitionists, smallpox, Hannah's search to decide which path to follow in her life, and Elizabeth's mid-life struggle to balance the safety of her family with outside commitments and needs, all rolled up in one book.  Some of the most interesting sub-plots here get the least focus--I feel like Elizabeth got lost in this novel, when she clearly has needs and concerns.  <br />I continue to have trouble with the denizens of Paradise (oddly ironic name for a place that appears to be quite devoid of blessings).  They are so unappealing that they clash with the beauty of the natural surroundings and the Bonner family's values and sense of personal history and space that I really love.<br />I ended up liking this book and admiring Hannah, Elizabeth and Nathaniel all over again, but not loving it.	2002-10-24

In the past I have read her more traditionally romantic books, and I was pleasantly surprised by this novel.  There is a breadth of information and a depth of characters here that puts this above many of her other books for me.  I was genuinely interested in Kelsey and Naiomi's relationship, and pleased with the way that both of them, and Kelsey's father as well, seem to learn and grow in the course of the book.  The supporting characters are also good, and there is enough detail to the descrptions of the world of horse racing to make the story feel realistic.  <br />Interestingly enough, I think the weakest character in the novel is Gabe, who seems fraught with contradictions that I think should have bothered Kelsey, given her concern for ethics and rights and wrongs.  I am not disturbed by Gabe's background at all, but I am puzzled by the acceptance of him as a \\"gambler,\\" which sometimes seems to feed into some of the stereotypes abotu racing that the novel seems to be trying to contradict.<br />Overall, I think this is a good vacation read.

This book covers a tremendous amount of ground, and it is sometimes unclear how all the pieces fit together.  Where else would you find cricket, ALS, and animal rights activists all in one novel?  This is a novel that takes all of these disparate subjects, plus the lives of Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers, and manages to bring them together, in a way that is ultimately fascinating.  The change of narrration from the rest of the books in this excellent series is particularly interesting.  Olivia is a compelling narrator, and it is easy for the reader to get carried along in her version of her mother's and Kenneth Fleming's life and then have to remind oneself that this is her imagined version, subject to interpretation, personal issues, etc.<br />Barbara Havers has some new and perplexing characters to deal with here, who have promise for the future.  Gradually her self-imposed isolation is starting to be broken down, leaving her puzzled, chagrinned, and more human than ever before.  I was less interested in the continuing vaccilations of Thomas Lynley's relationship with Lady Helen.	2002-09-10

I am not usually horrified by reading novels about violent events, and there are other books that I have read and reviewed and have not been adversely affected by when other people have had concerns--Martha Grimes' The Lamorna Wink comes to mind.  <br />Interestingly enough, Well Schooled In Murder upset me very much.  I am not sure what the main issue is for me here, but the murder of the child Matthew, and the graphic depiction of his parents, first happy and full of joy in their world, and then plunged into horrifying grief, really bothered me.  I almost stopped reading several times, and then decided that I neede to persevere.  I'm glad I did, I guess, and I will certainly continue with Elizabeth George's series, which I have really loved so far, but this was hard for me.<br />I also found the estrangement of Deborah and Simon Alcourt St. James difficult and painful.  As I think about it now, Simon's comment to Deborah's question of \\"how do we get back?\\" is important.  He says \\"we go on,\\" and maybe that is the answer to most of the pain in this book.	2002-06-03

The ironically unlikely but ultimately well-suited detective team of Thomas Lynley, aristrocratic to the core, and Barbara Havers, from a working class London slum, are really interesting characters.  The case that they are asked to solve here has some rather sensational characteristics and is much deeper and more moving than it initially appears.  I was impressed with the depth of the story.<br />I decided to read this after reading most of Martha Grimes' novels.  Elizabeth George has some similarities, although this is a much darker book than Grimes' Richard Jury books, which have the comic joys of Melrose Plant and Aunt Agatha to warm them up a bit.

I really loved A Suitable Vengeance, the first novel in this series.  This one took me a little longer to get into, but I found it equally interesting and compelling, once it got started.  <br />Thomas Lynley has to confront his feelings for Lady Helen Clyde, whose lover may (or may not) be implicated in a murder.  Lynley is, at first, remarkably blind to his own feelings, and then lets jealously completely overtake himself and his judgement.  He also is blind to the ways that Scotland Yard CID is manipulating him, taking advantage of his class assumptions and loyalties.  <br />Barabara Havers, with her own set of class assumptions and much more stunted interpersonal relations, has to confront her loyalties to Lynley and to her career, and is the character who probably grows the most in this book.<br />There are quite a few \\"red herrings\\" here, from a traditional mystery perspective.  I am usually les interested in figuring out mystery stories than I am in the character development along the way, but I will say that I figured out the villain in this one!	2002-06-03

The ending feels like a terrible betrayal of human opportunity and possibility.  I think, however, that that is exactly the point that Shreve was trying to make.  The characters are lost here, before they even get a chance to begin, and the loss of them and their wise and weak human longings and choices is painful.  <br />This novel has a lot of echoes of other Shreve novels--there is a strong sense of place, as in The Pilot's Wife and The Weight of Water, and the sense of passion as such a powerful force that it distorts logic is similar to what the characters face in Fortune's Rocks and Where of When, which this novel resembles in many ways.  <br />This certainly won't make me want to stop reading Anita Shreve's work (in fact, I have Sea Glass waiting for me on my large pile of books to be read), but I am waiting to see what she does next and to see if she can come up with someting that omoves beyond the territory she has very painstakingly carved out for herself.	2002-04-23

This book teams with history and myth and mystery, and that makes it wonderful to read, in much the same way that Possession was wonderful and assaulted the mind and the senses with the glory of words and the loveliness of the world.<br />This is a book that makes you want to go and do research, if you have any scholarly inclinations at all.  I know that Phineus Nanson begins his story by saying that he is giving up on words and needs things, but the irony of all of this is that his search for things takes him right back to research and to word-play.	2002-04-23

The character of \\"Dana,\\" if that is what we are to call her, comes close here--a woman who has exhausted the thrill of risk for monetary gain in her life and can only get a thrill from inventing new ways to take risks. (This is mixed with a spoken longing to just lead a normal, British life, which is not completely an act, I think.) <br />Richrad Jury is still looking for a soulmate in this novel, and instead runs into a character who is as unable to commit as he is. In this novel Jury seems to be presented with a variety of alternatives for his life: continuing his solitary life, letting \\"Kate McBride\\" in, or letting Carole-ann in. All of these alternatives are eductive in some way.<br />Melrose Plant also seems to be trying out alternative lives in this book--he stays at Borings, a hilariously funny traditional men's club, and also succumbs to the dubious attractions of the Cripps' establishment. Along the way we see new aspects to Bea Slocum, a character who seems to bring out the best in Melrose, and Diane Demornay, who comes along at the right moment to save the day.<br />This is a good example of Grimes' later Richard Jury novels, which certainly have complex, interesting plots, but actually are more psychological studies of her main characters. I like this later work a great deal.	2002-04-14

Macalvie wrestles with some of the same demons Jury does (for instance, an apparent inability to have a satisfying relationship and a dogged need to resolve cases that are rife with complexity).  Naturally, the two men initially drive each other rather crazy.  Here it is Melrose Plant who is able to be the bridge between them, appreciated by both of them, serving to center and calm both of them.<br />This is a complicated story about how revenge can become the abiding force in a life, and, conversely, how deciding to care aobut someone else can make even the most damaged person capable of strength and greatness.	2002-04-14

He meets a lonely, beautiful woman in a graveyard at the beginning, but a day later she is dead ahd he is left holding questions instead and trying to tie together the pieces of the woman's life, which seem oddly unfinished.  <br />Along the way, he meets up with Melrose Plant, Agatha, and Vivian, on a Christmas visit at a stately home with a rather conventional cast of odd upperclass guests and hangers-on.  <br />This is a novel that is strong on atmosphere and interesting side characters--the crumbling pensioners in the equally disintegrating seaside resort are especially powerful.  The plot, which deals with changelings, sometimes seems contrived, but ends up havng its own power.	2002-04-14

Despite this, this is a poignant, rather unfinished story about a child who seems to belong to no one and have no past and has given herself to protecting animals. Not even Richard Jury is able to protect Carrie Flood, and this is parinfully sad.<br />One of the fun things about this novel is the introduction of Carole-ann, definitely a mutilayered character, and to see the development of Mrs. Wasserman.	2002-04-13

The Lamorna Wink is a long trip away from such early books as The Dirty Duck and The Old Fox Deceiv'd.  It follows a recent trend in Grimes' work to have complex supporting characters and multiple plots and also a general sense of unsettled melancholy that is probably annoying if you don't like her characters, and addictive if you do.<br />This is definitely Melrose Plant's story, although he is spirited away back to Long Pid just as things get wrapped up.  The surprise here is that we become privy to a lot more detail about the parents and early life of Melrose than ever before, and that is interesting.  We find out new depths to Brian Macalvie also.<br />A lot of people have commented on what might be called the horrifying or unsavory elements of the plot of this novel.  I certainly agree that there are horrible things that happen here, but I would agree with one reviewer who says that horrible things do happen in this world.  I was more concerned because the different stands of the story didn't always fit together.  Motives seemed to be stretched at times.<br />I certainly won't give up on Martha Grimes anytime soon.	2002-04-03

It is not easy to read, but it is not about easy subjects--families and memories and love and betrayal and truth and history.  Kathleen, the narrator here, begins her story crippled in some way be all of these things.  If she is certainly not healed byt he end of the book, she is more self-aware and has freed herself to the point where she can allow herself to live in the present, and maybe in the future, instead of always focussing her life and anger on the past.  She is a complicated, not necessarily likeable character, but one of the saving graces of her pilgrimage back to Ireland is that she meets up with a succession of people who are able to see through the barricades of her life and give her credit for things she is not able to credit in herself.<br />The historical narrative of the Talbot adultery and divorce trial, set in the time of the famine, when civilization was stripped away so terribly, and Kathleen's retelling of those events, goes through several different versions here.  It is clear early on that we will never know the truth of these events, and that is both sad and also tantilizingly provocative, as Kathleen realizes as she lives her own experience through these characters.<br />Some reviewers have compared this book to A. S. Byatt's Possession, which is one of my favorite books.  It is, in its weaving of multiple tales and in its prickly, complex characters.  Both are books that deserve thought and respect.	2002-03-20

However, the strength of this book is in the scenes in The Anodyne Necklace and its surrounding London slum neighborhood, which is full of eccentrics, odd as can be, but fully enjoying their sordid lives.<br />The murderer is a surprise here as well.  <br />This is also the novel that introduces Jenny Kennington, who is as enigmatic at the beginning of this series as she is later on.  I am not sure of her appeal for Richard Jury!	2002-03-10

As an American, albeit one who is writing British mysteries, she comes up with a whole tour full of unsympathetic American tourists here--even down to what I think are supposed to be humerous names for them.  I think this is unfortunate, since it weakens the book, which has a plot that could have held up just as well if the characters were less insistantly annoying.<BR>Martha Grimes is one of my favorite writers, and I don't think this novel holds up anywhere near as well as the others in this wonderful series.	2002-03-10

Agatha Raisin is still unsure that she is going to stay in Carsley, and her pursuit of James Lacey is not going well at the beginning of this novel, but the death of Paul Bladen, a womanizing vet with a sadistic streak for cats and small dogs, gives Agatha a reason to root around in the seething emotional life of her seemingly placid small town again.  As she searches for the clues in the murder of the vet she also starts to make a connection with Lacey, and unleashes some surprising sleuthing skills in him as well.<br />The plot holds together well here, and there are some very funny scenes, as there usually are with Agatha.  It is also fun to see Agatha building attachments and becoming much more vulnerable and human than she thinks that she is.	2002-03-10

Richard Jury, depressed at the start of the novel, finds himself engrossed in the diffiult circumstances of Nell Healy, who murders her husband in a pub lounge, while Jury watches.  As Jury attempts to discover why Nell would have done this, and how it ties in to the tragic kidnapping of her step-son ten years before, he is drawn into different eccentric groups of people--an ill-assorted group living in a b&amp; b near Haworth, home of the Brontes and the dark world of alternative rock and roll performers.  This musical mileiu is definitely new to Jury--although it turns out to be familiar territory for Seargent Wiggins!<br />The different worlds of this book do not completely fit together.  There is sometimes an odd disjunction between the parts of this novel,and I agree somewhat with one reviewer who says that she doesn't understand the role that Melrose Plant plays here, other than to add his usual gentle comic charm, and to interact with many of the eccentric.  <br />Despite some of this, this is also a moving and emotionally successful novel.  The literary and musical allusions have deep meaning and are releent not just to the progression of the plot but also to the ongoing growth of the characters in this series.<BR>I credit Martha Grimes with taking chances with this novel.	2002-02-28

The plot itself is fairly complex, although not completely difficult to figure out, and it ends with what appears to be an action sequence in the life of the Richard Jury books--in a church, no less!<br />It is interesting to be introduced to Vivian, the femme fatale of Richard Jury, Melrose Plant, etc., in this book.  I am not sure that I ocmpletely see the attraction, but that seems to be one of the interesting truths about relationships that comes out in Martha Grimes' books--relationships and attractions have a strength and life of their own.	2002-02-24

This is the first of Martha Grimes' books that I have read, so I don't have much to compare it with, but I really loved it.  The characters are vivid and interesting, and there is a wonderful sense of place here.  I hadn't thought much about the English fens, but this book makes you want to look at pictures of them or go there.  Grimes' descriptions of the light on the fens are particularly good.<br />I figured out who the murderer was fairly early on here, but, as with many of the mystery writers that I like, who did it isn't as important as how you get there, and this is an excellent book from that perspective.  The characterizations are wonderful, and the child character of Zell is particularly spendid.<br />One comment here is that this books seems to exist out of time.  I know that it is supposed to be set in the present, but there is very little way to tell that as you read.  Some might say that this is not a good thing--is English life that changeless in the upper classes? but I found it interesting and perhaps intentional.	2002-02-20

However, I agree with another reviewer who says that Nathaniel and Elizabeth deserve a little peace and stability at some point.  This novel runs along at breakneck speed, and some of the beautiful intensity of &quot;place&quot; that made Into the Wilderness so lovely is lost here.

US	50420175	R4E0RR4U8HDLZ	0375700269	719393029	Evening	Books	4	7	9	N	N	A challenging book	I have several reactions to this book.  The first is that the prose is beautifully evocative and Susan Minot has constructed a beautiful book.  I also had the feeling, voiced by several other reviewers at least, that thee is a odd sort of flatness to the story and to the life of Ann Lord, who appears on the surface to have had so much.  I think, however, that this may be intentional.  As she approaches death, the layers are stripped away, and all of the possessions and relationships that she has had  are stripped away.  Who can say what would be left as the center point of consciousness for any of us at that point?<br />For Ann Lord, the weekend of her best friend's wedding, all those years ago, and her weekend affair with Harris Arden become the focal point.  As I read the flashbacks to that weekend, I had a sense both of deep sadness and simultaneously a great excitement and sense of possibility.  Both existed in that time, and both are carried forward in memory.  I think the sense of being so alive and having the heights and depths of love and emotion and death all in that short compressed time is part of why all that returns to Ann Lord as she waits to die.<br />Many reviewers have been extremely critical of Harris Arden and questioned why such a cad has the significance that he does for Ann and how that relationship may actually diminish her in some way.  He is certainly not a sympathetic character, either in his interactions with Ann or in his treatment of his fiancee.  I also can only guess whether that weekend was an anomaly for him or whther such relationships were common for him.  If it was as distinct and seperate a time for him, a moment out of the normal round of his life, I can have some empathy for him.  I am unsure of that.	2002-02-07

I came to this after reading lots of M. C. Beaton's Hamish MacBeth mysteries.  This one has the same local color--in this case mellower on the surface because the Cotswolds don't have quite the same dourly forbidding quality at the Scottish highlands--and the same wonderfully eccentric supporting characters.  Agatha Raisin is a complex character, not easy to like, but probably ultimately hard not to love, as she starts to blend in with the people of Carsley.  (The Agatha who lies on her kitchen floor throwing balls of tin foil to her kitten would be unrecognizable to the tough-cookie Agatha of London public relations fame!)<br />As with most of the Hamish books, the fun here isn't in who did the murder but in how Agatha figures it out.	2002-01-07
US	50420175	RNERV6DGQ43FU	0553578529	391628853	Into the Wilderness	Books	4	5	6	N	N	This one grew on me!	I like historical romantic fiction, especially when the history recounted is accurate and you can learn as you read.  This is true with this novel, which grows in strngth as it goes along.  I had a hard time getting into the story for about the first hundred pages, and then this really took on a voice and power of its own.  The characters of Elizabeth and Nathaniel are strong and consistent, and their relationship is compelling.  There is also lots of scope for the sequal Dawn on a Distant Shore.<br />The one drawback to this book, I think, is that the settlers of Paradise are very unsympathetic characters most of the time.  There is a cartoonish quality to the villains and the subplot that isn't up to the quality of the rest of the book and the dignity that is given to most of the other characters.  That made the beginning of the novel hard for me.  <br />As an aside, it was fun to have Sara Donati link this story with Diana Gabaldon't wonderful characters from Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, etc.  There is a similarity to the chracters and sense of place evoked in these two series of books that is very satisfying.	2002-01-07

This will further confuse those who read my reviews and get aggravated that I re-read books when there are so many new books in the world to read, but this is honestly one of my favorite series of books, primarily because of this novel and Dragonfly in Amber, its immediate sequal.<br />This is a fabulous time travel and historical romance novel, with wonderful characters, lots of very accurate historical and cultural detail, and a very convincing, powerful plot. It is a very hard book to describe, since its plot sounds immensely improbable, but it rings true and sound. Claire and Jamie are very real to me, and I have great appreciation for the respect that Gabaldon gives to these characters.  I read an interview with her once in which she said that she intended to tell the story of a marriage, and she is extremely successful with that in this book and its sequals.<br />One of the most interesting things I notices, in my re-reading, is that there are details that I missed the first time around that show that a great deal of forethought has gone into the way the series is constructed.  This is quite remarkable, since this book alone is very long, and the overall series is sprawling and complex.  There are details that tie the characters to the later books.<br />If you have not read these, be prepared to be delighted and moved.  I am looking forward, with some anxiety, to reading The Fiery Cross overy Christmas,and I really don't want to be disappointed by it because I love these characters and the general premise of the books so much.	2001-12-11

I have to give Amy Tan credit for doing a masterful portrait of a woman with Alzheimer's-like dementia!  I have had both a mother-in-law and a grandmother-in-law with Alzheimer's, and reading Tan's depiction of Ruth's mother was moving and painful and frustrating--all very recognizable to someone who has had experience with this terrible situation.<br />I will admit that this story echoes much of Amy Tan's earlier works, dealing with the relationships between Chinese mothers and daughters and the secret, painful, hidden lives that the mothers have led.  I think this version of this story works well, however. <br />Ruth, the daughter in this novel, has her own coming of age story here, where she has to deal with the the adult tasks of caring for her mother and staking out her own adult relationship.  I liked Ruth, and I deeply empathize with many of the issues she is dealing with, and the impact of her mother's secrets on her life is deep and powerful.  <br />My main concern here is that maybe the ending is too good.  The end of the novel is rather like the happy ever after of a fairy tale.  To a certin extent it didn't seem to ring completely true to me.	2001-11-16

This is a re-vision of the life of the Brontes, placed in the setting of an Australian prison community on an isolated island.  I cannot imagine how the author, herself and Australian, decided to merge these ostensibly very different concepts, but the result is powerful and dreamlike--and usually, but not always, works.  I was really intrigued.<br />One of the things I found most impressive is the struggle here between &quot;the life of the mind&quot; and &quot;real life&quot; in the outer world of action.

I like mysteries and am not usually a fan of Christian fiction, but I tried this, and I will say it is a pleasant, quick read, with pleasant characters.  The plot holds together well, and the main character, a retired cop working as a security guard in a theme park, does deal with Christian ethical issues in a human way-not at all seeing himself as being above others or being above what he perceives to be temptation.<br />I'm not sure I will read more from this series, but I am glad I gave it a try.

I am able to recount all this without really ruining this for other readers because it is not really a surprise.  The fun of reading M. C.

I really like Hamish MacBeth and I like the way M.C. Beaton develops her characters. I am definiely reading these out of order, so I am coming to the engagement of Hamish and Priscilla somewhat out of season, but I am impressed with the way that Beaton develops the serious ambivalence in their relationship and the poignant loss at the end of the novel at the same time that she is able to have some very funny, lighthearted scenes. <br />There is a lot of human sadness here--I really felt for the poor, excitement starved women of Drim who yearn so much for the Charming Man of the title.  I was also really drawn to the child, Heather, old beyond her years with Celtic wisdom.<br />I really like the layers of meaning and strength of the characters in these books.	2001-09-13

This is the first Hamish McBride mystery I have read, and I really loved it!  Hamish is a wonderfully understated (and underestimated) character, and the supporting characters here are really nicely developed and recognizable as small town types all over the world, not just in Scotland!  There is, however, a really nice sense of &quot;place&quot; here, which I, as a fan of all things Scottish, enjoyed!  The story is also simple and fun--this is a very fast read and well worth it!	2001-09-05

As with most of the best ofDick Francis' books, the hero here is truly human and has doubts and worries and feels pain and desire while also acting fairly super-human when confronted with difficult situations.  This time the plot is tight and excellent and the characters are well-developed and grow in the course of the novel.  There are good supporting characters and a good romantic story.  I recommend this on if you are just finding Dick Francis.	2001-09-04

This one ends up having a fairly riveting story, with genuinely unpleasant villains.  as with most of Francis' heros, he is deceptively stubborn and survives hideous experiences to bring things to a safe conclusion.  This one, however, leaves some loos ends hanging.  We are lefft wondering what will happen to his Italian girlfriend (characteristically, for this hero, they are instantly in love but can't speak the same language, so there is a distance between them, as there is with the rest of the hero's family and acquaintances) and what choices he will make about the rest of his life.	2001-09-04

However, we would not be a good match, since I, like his ex-wife, would be aggravated because he wouldn't be reliable and be home on time for dinner.<br />Levity aside, I am predisposed to like and of Francis' books about Halley, and there are things I like here.  I like Sid having a chance to develop relationships with some people and having a chance to genuinely love, as he does with the little girl with leukemia here.  I also really want him to have a satisfying relationship, and he seems to be interested in that, although I don't think the love interest in this one is as pleansant or as good a prospect as in Whiphand.<br />However, as some other reviewers have noted, this seems to be a rather mean-spirited book.  I don't understand why the handsome man who appears to have everything stoops to mutilating horses, and I don't understand what the fundamental message about human nature is here.  I think Francis was really trying to say something profound here, but I can't get to it.  I was left feeling like I missed something important, and it made me frustrated and sad.	2001-09-04

This one took me a little bit more time to get into, perhaps more because of busyness in my own life than actually having trouble getting into the story, but, as in the past with these books, I ended up being very satisfied. There is a slightly larger cast of supporting characters here than in the past books, and this one is a little less overtly political (not so much worry about Napoleonic France here) but there are certainly class and social issues. Jane is more socially anxious than in the earlier books, as she heads off to the opulant home of her Whig friends. Some of this is a class and political consciousness, and some of this comes from  the growing sense that she is older, without money, and without some of the prospects for happiness that she has to admit she yearns for. This is stronger here than in any of th earlier books. Jane's relationship with Sir Harold Trowbridge brings her both great joy and terrible pain, as she confronts the abyss between their social positions and knows that she can never home to cross the divide between them, no matter how beautifully their minds work together and they appreciate each other.<br />The actual plot here is as clear and direct as the plot of the ealier books as well--solving the mystery is not the ultimate satisfaction here. It is coming to that solution with the very satisfying characters.	2001-09-03

There are some books that are really problematic to review.  This is one of them for me.  On the positive side, my gut reaction is that there is a lot of truth to the authors' theories, and it presents a compelling way to look at quilts.  I will think if the quilt patterns discussed here from a slightly different frame of reference after reading this, and that is, overall, a good thing.  This is a also a book that could make history and textiles come alive for someone who is just becoming interested in the underground railroad, quilts, etc.<br />My concern here (and I will be echoing the comments of lots of others who have written reviews) is that the authors' have virtually no corroborative evidence to back up their theories, and this is a major flaw in a book that purports to be a scholarly text.  I understand very well that the lack of evidence is probably unavoidable, given the fragility of textiles, particularly from the age and circumstances that these would be, and also given the whole premise of these quilts being &quot;hidden in plain sight.&quot;  I guess that I would wish that the authors would have framed their discussion with some a discussion of some of this so that their story does not appear to be quite so speculative.	2001-08-16

The first time I was predominantly aware of the lushness of Byatt's language, which is something I notice when I first read all of her books.  For me it almost impedes my ability to understand and follow the plot.  The second reading for me was much more satisfying.  I really like the Potter family, with all of their eccentricity and irrascibility.  <br />The is the beginning of a very satisfying, sometimes very sad, series of books.

The supporting characters grow and the historical details and the connections between history and the fictional plots get stronger.  It is especially interesting to have Jane become older and to have her wrestling with the plight of being an unattached older woman, in what she would call somewhat distressed circumstances.<br />This book has some especially nice social scenes and some broadens the Austin extended family a bit.  Neddie and his wife Lizzy are just as engaging as Henry and Eliza, who have appeared in the earlier books.	2001-08-10

The plot here is pretty good, although somewhat far fetched.  However, this novel varies from the typical successful Francis formuala by having a sexual interlude between the hero and a female supporting character quite early on in the story.  This is unusual, since Francis' characters are typcially fairly chaste, but this has the addes uniqueness of having the supporting female character be an older woman who wants to experience sex and chooses the hero, barely recovered from a dangerous brush with criminal types, as her man.  This is diverting mostly because it seems to me that it is so different from the norm!  I was quite taken aback by this!	2001-08-09

Byatt's books, this is a tour de force, provoking strong reactions and emotions from most readers.  There are very moving parts of this book, mostly addressing Frederica's relationship with her young son, and some dealing with her ambivalence to her abusive husband.  I also think this is a very strong reflection of English society in the early 60s, with all of its complexity and contradictions.<br />However, I did not have the overall strong personal reaction to Frederica here that I do to other Byatt heroines.  I guess I have always found Frederica difficult, through all three of the books centering on her, and this doesn't help me resolve my ambivalence.  (I also suspect that we are supposed to be somewhat ambivalent towayr her as a character, so this is probably very successful on Byatt's part!)	2001-08-09

The everyday world is here, as in the first book, but the world of myth is very close to the surface.  I was fascinated by the myth of the Greenwitch.  Susan Cooper has a truly unique take on Arthurian legend here.  It is worth reading what ever age you are!	2001-08-07
US	50420175	RQZ5MOFKURQ64	0515116173	688943404	Decider	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Likeable hero, but...	I really enjoy Dick Francis' novels, but this one left me with some concerns.  There are, first of all, some really nice things here--the hero is pleasant and smart,as are all of Frnacis' engaging male characters, and the hero's house and children are great.  It is an interesting twist to have children as fairly major characters.<br />However, I was concerned with a couple things here.  First of all, the villains here are so nasty and one-dimensionable that they end up being cartoonish, and I think that detracts from the strength of the rest of the plt, which is pretty good.  Also, I am concerned with the hero's wife, who apparently is rather consistently unhappy and does not appreciate him as a husband and father, both of which he seems to be pretty admirable at.  She is a frustrating character.  I also found it rather frustrating and somewhat demeaning that Francis felt the need to come up with another romantic interest here, when I think his main character has quite enough issues to resolve already with wife and family.  The romantic interest here, in apperance a younger version of the wife, is superfluous.<br />Please don't get me all wrong here--I genuinely love Dick Francis, and this read well and is fun, but I expect and usually get more from him!	2001-08-07

That statement probably won't make any sense to someone who has not read the parts of A.S. Byatt's writing that are so gloriously detailed and visual, but this made me want to go to museums and really really look at Impressionist paintings.<br />I should also, probably more helpfully, say that this is a grand story of an English family in the 1950s--ultimately quite sad, but very insightful and socially and personally conscious.  You really love the characters in all their complexity by the end of this.  One of the other reviewers commented on a section that dealt with pregnancy and birth in the national health system of England--ironically an experience my mother describes in very similar detail from her pregnancy with me.  I also found that section deeply moving.<br />This is a sequal to The Virgin in the Garden, which is ambitious and harder to read.  The characters here have grown and are much more sympathetic and human.  You care very deeply for them.	2001-08-07

I was both fascinated and frustrated by this novel, which is simultaneously a mystery story about the hust for Peking Man, a love story between an American archaeologist and her Chinese counterpart, and a parable about cultural gaps and connections.  Alice, the American archaeologist and daughter of a racist American Congressman, has been attempting for much of her adult life to get rid of her American self and &quot;become&quot; Chinese.  Her attempts at this include sexual relationships with Chinese men, and &quot;trying on&quot; Chinese clothes and rituals.<br />When she meets Lin, the Chinese archaeologist who has secrets and losses of his own, she ultimately has to choose whether she is going to acknowledge and build on who she really is, in all of her own complexity, or whether she is going to continue to try to hide and cover herself up.  Her experience in this novel is painful and quite often frustrating to read, since she is not always a likeable or easily understood character.  We sruggle with some of her own ambivalence about herself.  <br />The characters' personal searches are mirrored by the history of China, which is heavy with secrets and losses of its own.  <br />I think this is an important addition to the list of novels that attempt to deal with Western/Eastern life &quot;in translation.&quot;	2001-07-15

Both of them have told me, at different times, that they wanted to write about what it was like to go to Africa to return to the United States and then try to sort out what their experiences had actually meant to them.  When they each read The Poisonwood Bible, both commented to me that they probably did not need to write that book themselves, since Barbara Kinsolver had written it for them.  I think that is a very important endorsement of this book.<br />I have not been to Africa, but it has become one of the personal &quot;filters&quot; that I use when I think of Africa, recent African history, and evangelical Christianity, all of which are major topics in this novel.  It is very different than Kingsolver's earlier novels, and it has places where it drags or is repetitive, but I think it is an excellent, thought-provoking book.	2001-07-14

This is a fast moving myster that kept my interest as a story and did give me some historical and biographical information about Austin and her time.  I think that sometimes Jane's exploits strain credulity a bit, but this is meant ot be light, entertaining fiction.  This Jane is quite indecently attracted to a handsome rogue in a way that echoes the irony of her society that hides all manner of devious motives and behavior under a facade of politeness and self-control.<br />I look forward to reading more of Stephanie Barron's Jane Austin novels.	2001-07-06

Hillerman's Southeast Asia at the end of the Vietnam era is evocative and detailed--just as one feels that one has entered Indian Country, one feel that one has landed, like Moon Mathias, in a completely disorienting new place here.  <br />Moon Mathias is a character who grows up in the course of this novel.  It is a wonderful, unusual coming of age novel, with a characters who doesn't trust his own resourcefulness or ability to commit to situations or people.  I was very impressed,  Unlike Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, who have strong internal value systems tht help them to make decisions, Moon Mathias has not been forced to think through what he really believes, and this story takes hima  long way on that journey of self-discovery.	2001-07-05

I really love A. S Byatt, who always makes me think and also had a really wonderful way of writing descriptions of the world that are vivid and civilized and also make us remember that we are part of the teaming natural world of insects.  I have read Angels and Insect three times, and I find that I enjoy it more deeply each time.<br />The first novella is set in a fairly conventional Victorian setting, and deals with the themes of man's relationship to the natural world (which here means that we have to think about Darwin and evolution) and whether we really are closer to the angels or the insects in our innate nature.<br />The hero here marries Eugenia, who appear to be the quintessential Victorian young lady, and finds himself married to a woman who is a breeding machine, also involved in incest.  In contrast to her self-absorbed fecundity is Mattie, the governess of the household, who embarks with him on a study of the wood ants in the woods of the estate.  Her careful, scientific observations and her logic ultimately win out and the hero leaves with her to explore in the Amazon, foresaking here the life of the ...for Mattie's  dry, brisk life of the mind.  <br />The second novella deals with spiritualism (another preoccupation of the late Victorian age) and with the fictional lives of the family and friends of Aldred Tennyson and Arthur Hallam, immortalized in In Memorium.  I think without some knowledge of the life of Tennyson and his work this may be a difficult work to figure out--it takes awhile even with the appropriate \\"literary\\" context.  It is a very strange, ultimately very moving ghost story.  I am very impressed with it and still not sure what all of it means.	2001-07-05

Taken in the context of her books, I can see its value and see how it picks up oncertain recurring themes that she has been dealing with for a long time, but it is clearly an early novel and not up to the wonderful standards of her more recent work.<br />It is an extremely sad story--two people who are deeply longing for understanding and fulfillment and who find each other again as adult, after years of seperation.  The descriptions of their paifully empty lives and almost too difficult to read at times, and the excitement and passion that grip them when they are together is intoxicating.  However, I was frustrated by the stereotyping of the supporting characters and the bleakness of the lives portrayed.<br />I am also puzzled by the ending, which can probably not help but be bleak, given the corners that Shreve has painted her characters into, but it seems almost too painful and morally judgemental, taken int he context of the story which she has very carefully developed.  I kept waiting for there to be more--waiting for a different ending.	2001-07-04

I read it about once a year, and I always find something new to notice in it.  It is a literary detective story, a very sharp and accurate depiction of the struggles of competing views of literary criticism in the 1980s, and also a deep and complex love story that addresses, on a very personal level, the great philosophical struggles of late Victorianism.  Darwinism and its impact on the central question of whatwe all are as humans, and connected religious questions are all addressed in the context of an extremely moving story about complex, adult characters who certainly did not expect or necessarily expect to find a soul mate in each other who would radically change each of their lives.  <br />This is not an easy book to read--it requires careful reading and a willingness to give Victorian poetry and conventions a chance.  If you are patient with it it will return your efforts one thousand-fold.	2001-07-04

One of the things tha continues to strike me about this story is that Shreve has not just had the heroine discover that her beloved husband has had a secret, adulterous life (quite enough to deal with) but has also had her discover that that other life is almost beyond her imagination--in another country, with political overtones.  It strains the reader's understanding as it strains hers. Her discovery of her husband's other family--including children--is something that haunted me for a long time after I finished reading this.<br />There is also a wonderful new hero here--the investigator sent by the FAA to study the crash is a wonderful, sympathetic, patient character.	2001-07-04

I guess I was a bit disappointed because I thought it was going to have a little more depth to it.  As I write this I guess I am thinking that maybe I am not being totally fair.  It is a fairly light, historical romance, with some elements of the supernatural (angels and cherubs) included.  It has a strong, untraditional heroine who is certainly resourceful, a hero who has to overcome a bad first impression, and an array of good supporting characters.	2001-07-03

The characters (except for Blake) are realistic, and learn in the course of the novel, which I think is one of the hallmarks of a good story.  The love story is realisitc and strong, and the author's descriptions of the Pacific Northwest are really lovely--her own love for the area shines through.<br />One of the interesting things about this story is that it contrasts a life that seems to have everything (beach house in California, life with enough money never to have to worry, etc.) with life in a poor logging town, and the everyday life of the logging town is the infinitely better and more fulfilling choice.  This choice rings true, as does Annie's attempt to stick with the commitments and relationships that she picked so long ago.  <br />The only problem is that Blake and the California life become stiff and one dimensional, which is too bad because I think the &quot;rightness&quot; of Annie's choice would still hve been clear even if he was a slightly more attractive character.	2001-06-28

Once I had myself acclimated, I enjoyed it a great deal, although I will say that I &quot;figured it out&quot; faster than I do some mysteries. <br />What I liked, I think, was the slightly unique setting and the things about Northern European horse racing that I had not know before.  I also thought the chracters were interesting and had some depth that is sometimes missing in Francis' books.  There are some characters in this one that I have wondered about as you would with real people--what made them turn out this way? and what is going to happen to them afterwords?	2001-06-20

What I find myself looking for, in mancy cases, is the philosophy beyond the plot.  In this case, the plot is about an attempt to sabotage the Moscow Olympics.  The plot holds together well, but what I enjoyed about this book is that it is a glimpse of the end of cold war Russia (of course from a British perspective) and it is an attempt to think about the personal decisions that humans make which shape of our lives and about personal freedom.  <br />I think Francis does a good job with these rather weighty themes, within the framework of the mystery/thriller genre that he has perfected over time.	2001-06-20

It is a book that sticks with me always.  Wonderful story, action when you need it (which is a hallmark of Franics novels) but not overshadowing the relationships in this story.  The hero is put in a situation where he has to feel his way along and learn his brother's business and life while simultaneously dealing with the loss of his brother and an emptiness in his life.  I found it very moving.  It is one of the few books that I have read where I have wondered what happens to the characters afterwords--as if they are real people.  (Actually, Dick Francis is one of the few authors who has that effect on me.  I also have that reaction to the three novels about Sid Halley.)  <br />I strongly recommend this book, even to those who are not primarily mystery readers.	2001-06-18

I learned a lot.  However, as a novel, I think it lacks something.  I don't think this lack is because the ultimate outcome is known from the onset--that's a staple of historical fiction.  I think it is that Mary is a somewhat flat and unappealing character here.  One other reviewer said that she is a potentially stong woman who makes collossally bad decisions, and I think that is a very wise comment.  She is hard to become emotionally connected with, and the Lords, her political adversaries, and sometimes cartoonish in their villany.  I stopped reading about two-thirds of the way through and skimmed the rest before returning the book to the Library.	2001-06-18

If I read it in the larger context of his work, it does seem to be something of an anomaly--not first and foremost about horses, and not concentrating on action and the understated heroics that many Francis heros find themselves forced into.  ...there is a depth to the character of Alexander--a sort of simultaneous self-undertanding and also a oneliness that he wishes he could get past--that is touchingly human.  I actually think this book has much more depth than some of the more action-packed stories.  I would recommend it.	2001-06-18

This novel is tangentially about horses, and it is a mystery, but I think it is also an attempt by Francis to try something a little bit different.  It is a coming-of-age novel, with a promising by very young hero, and it also has some elements of the long tradition of the British comedy of manners. <br />While it will nver be in my top ten percent of Francis' novels, it has a sunniness and good cheer that makes it a good light read.	2001-06-18

I admire this book deeply and often read it with some dread, knowing the ominous end that characters were going to come to.  Its characters are both larger than life and sometimes less than human, and it is a very &quot;male&quot; book.  (This is certainly not meant to be an insult.)  I had not had much knowledge of Simon de Montfort prior to reaidng this, and I was very impressed with his story and how it connects up with the legend of Robin Hood and the stirrings of the political strength of the common man in England.  I also, as several reviewers have noted, was horrified and moved by Penman's unflinching handling of anti-Semitism.  She shows the struggle of genuinely good men dealing with the deep-seated cultural constructs of their times, and that is an important lesson for all of us.	2001-05-14

One of the reviewers who wrote about Resistance said that he/she thought it would have been a stronger book if it had dealt more with the horrors of the concentration camps.  I don't think this is necessarily true.  I found the juxtaposition of &quot;normal life&quot; and the horrors of war extremely moving.  The last chapter, set in the present, was also very moving and reenforced the humanity of all the characters.	2001-05-14

The heroine, a modern ancient language scholar, is extremely smart, equally human, and unassuming.  It is splendid fun to see her come to grips and change as she deals with tremendous adversity.  What surprised me when I got into this book was that it is a mystery and much of it is set in the present time.  The present time and the past merge and most of the logic works pretty well, so I was genuinely pleased.  I also agree with most reviewers that it is a fairly torrid romance, once the characters find themselves together.  It was great fun.	2001-05-14

One of the most remarkable things for me as a reader was to read and have the world of Lyra's Oxford be familiar and then suddenly to realize that this world is slightly out of kilter with our own world.  I also thought that the concept of daemons as the manifestation of the soul was wonderful--especially since virtually all daemons are the opposite gender than their humans.  That's a nice Jungian touch, I think.  <br />As for the story, it is quite often heart-rending.  This is a children's book but not for really young children.  It reminds me a bit of Susan Cooper's books, in terms of age appropriateness.  I think they are children's books that grow with you into adulthood.	2001-04-08

Tim Power's The Sress of Her Regard is tuly exceptional--it is an alternative &quot;biography&quot; of the Romantic poets, a scary and sometimes gory vampire story, a distinctly odd and profoundly affecting love story, and a literary tour de force.  It was housed with science fiction in my local library, but I think this does it an injustice (with no offence meant to those who love science fiction).  It transcends a great many boundaries.  It was lyrical, creepy, thought-provoking, and has made me re-read and re-think Keat, Byron, and Shelley.  I wish it was still in print.  It is a book I would love to own and share with others.

Like a few other readers who reviewed this book, I ended up reading it shortly before Christmas, which was an odd experience.  I think Connie Willis' basic premise for this book is ingenious--time travel with technology that is still dependent on humble human beings to operate it, parallels between the Middle Ages and our supposedly non-superstitious, logical world, and the ageless power of human love.  On the surface it is also written in simple language and the &quot;modern&quot; parts of the story sometimes stuck me as simplistic and silly, although I think that may be part of her intention.  The &quot;time travel&quot; sections were almost painful to read.  The inexorable progress of the plague through the village and its devestation of human live, civilization, and culture was harrowing.  There were times when I wanted to stop reading, which rarely happens for me, but I stuck with it because it felt important to stay with the characters.  In a culture that thinks itself impervious to disaster but is currently threatened by AIDS and mad cow disease, which are just as sinister and potentially devastating as the plague for the Middle Ages, this book brings the fragility of human being to the forefront.	2001-03-21

It brings a world that is distant in time, location, and values home to the modern reader in a vivid way.  It is not always a comfortable book, but it is sharp and thought-provoking.  As many others have noted, the love story is moving and emotionally strong.  The end of the book, dealing with the reconciliation after adultary, is written lyrically and with power.  It probes cultural beliefs about men and women, sexuality, and love in an intensely emotional, personal way.	2001-03-15

Bosworth does a good job of drawing on interviews with people who knew Diane Arbus, and the reader does a get a vivid sense of what the burgeoning photography community was like in the 1960s.  One concern I have is that this is very mucha re-telling of a life, not really an in-depth analysis.  There is a certain lack of introspection about this, and the book fades off and becomes more episodic toward the end.  I can't quite decide if that is intentional--an attempt to show a life coming apart at the seams--or just some final exaustion with the subject.	2001-02-02

I should start by saying that Heahter Graham clearly loves Florida and its history, and her descriptions and background are quite lovely.  This book and its sequal, Captive, do a nice job of teaching about the early history of the state.  I liked that a lot.<br />In most ways this book adheres quite closely to formulaic romance novel conventions. The hero and heroine deal with secrets and misunderstandings and also deal with tumultuous passion that makes all the secrets and misunderstandings fade.  I am never sure about this as the basis for strength in a romantic relationship in these stories. I am concerned with some of the Byronic aggression of the hero and with the heroine's unwillingness to reveal even basic information about herself--with this level of lack of trust, how can their relationship grow at all?<br />However, the tumultuous passion here is steamy and fun, and the historical background is important and helps to develop the characters.  I ended up really liking Jarrett McKenzie and Tara Brent and being very glad that they have a happy, satisfying life and reoccur in Captive.  <br />Ultimately, good historical romance and a lot of escapist fun.	2001-01-11

The contrast between her and Charlene, another little girl who appears to have it all (and maybe get the pony for her own too!) is moving.  I would recommend this for all horse-hungry children.	2001-01-04
US	50420175	R362YVSIN4GXPT	0688142761	533440537	When We Married Gary	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A beautiful book...	This is a beautiful, helpful book.  I have a eight year old daughter who continues to deal with issues of adoption, divorce, remarriage, new  siblings, etc. We found this book in the public library shortly before her  Dad got re-married last year.  At first she was reluctant to read it with  me, since she has struggled with the issues that come with blended families  (while simultaneously loving her stepfather and siblings very much and also  loving her stepmother-to-be.)  The book has beautiful illustrations, which  got her attention first.  Once we got started, we read and re-read the book  over and over, and it is a book we talk about often.  I need to buy it for  her to own forever.  It is a book that deals very honestly with the sadness  that comes with losing a dad and the initial fears and then wonderful  discoveries that come with allowing a new father to enter one's life.  <br />I  highly recommend this book.	2000-08-31
