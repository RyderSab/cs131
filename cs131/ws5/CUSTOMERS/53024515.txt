Scot Harvath was introduced in the first novel by Brad Thor, \\"The Lions of Lucerne.\\"  It was such a spectacular book that I couldn't believe it was Thor's first.  Happily, he has continued with the exciting life of Agent Harvath.  In his fourth novel, Blowback, Harvath is captured on Al Jazeera TV chasing down and beating ruthlessly an innocent shopkeeper in Baghdad.  It has been a deliberate set-up by a top-ranking Al Qaeda terrorist who Harvath was closing in on, who paid the merchant to switch places with him.  Harvath's face was not shown, but a conniving female senator you love to hate relentlessly investigates the national embarrassment in hopes of derailing the re-election of popular President Rutledge (who has also been a \\"regular\\" in the Harvath books).  Senator Carmichael uses every resource at her disposal to discover the identity of the American operative involved in the apparent black ops incident.  A beleaguered president sends Harvath out of the country before the senator can have the supoena served and expose him publicly.  So begins the story.<br /><br />To my initial puzzlement, this book almost departed from any believability as a convoluted plot developed to restore the Ottoman empire and annihilate most of the US population using a biological weapon derived from a discovery of Hannibal's expedition over the Alps.  No, I'm not kidding.  I wasn't sure I could \\"get into\\" such a far-fetched story, but after going through the dubious origin of the mysterious poison-cum-biological weapon, the author steered the story back into the familiar area of high-tech weaponry, betrayals, near escapes, and strong characters who were lifelike.  By the middle of the book I was enthralled and I have to admit I ended up enjoying Blowback every bit as much as Thor's previous three novels.  The action scenes are masterfully executed.  With Thor, you get either heroic, noble characters or complete scoundrels; you don't see much in between.  Naturally the hero is always right in his instincts and always smarter than his rivals or foes.  This works perfectly when a reader wants to enjoy an armchair escape from a complicated world and just enjoy being entertained by nonstop action.  I recommend Blowback very highly.  I do think it's best to buy all four books and read them in order: The Lions of Lucerne, Path of the Assasin, State of the Union, and Blowback.  I can promise that anyone who opens the first one will hungrily read (and love) all four novels.  In fact, I can't wait for the next installment...hope he brings back Scot Harvath soon!ways right in his instincts and always smarter than his rivals or foes.

I am no fan of self-help books, but when I saw it was written by Fr. Benedict Groeschel I hastened to buy it.  This book is a treasure!  I enjoyed it and got more out of it than even his most famous book Arise From Darkness.  Each chapter is written in a conversational way, addressing a set of issues that I think everyone faces at one time or another.  The chapter covering the Love of God treats not only that we love God but also knowing and accepting on a deep level that God loves us.  That may sound like a simple fact that everyone of faith knows, but this chapter made me truly realize the depth of His love.  All this ties directly into forgiveness and charity.  My own experience was remarkable: I started each chapter thinking, \\"This doesn't apply to me at all.\\"  Then something in it would hit me squarely between the eyes.  There are great insights in each chapter, as well as sound, step-by-step advice on how to overcome common problems.<br /><br />Aside from the rich content, Fr. Groeschel's writing style is very captivating.  His New York sense of humor made me homesick, and I found myself smiling at many of his quips (and seeing myself in the picture all too often)! Here is one example I particularly loved:<br /><br />  \\"Pride sneaks down into the bottom of our soul.  It makes us believe that we are something more than a creature.  Pride makes us demand the things that are God's.  It says, 'I will not serve,' or, 'I will serve, but only under these circumstances,' or, 'I am willing to do everything you want, God, but could I make a suggestion?  I'll carry the cross, but preferably something with wheels on one end, and a nice little shoulder pad.'\\"<br /><br />And so, I heartily recommend this book for anyone and everyone.  It's disarmingly straightforward and very much on target.  I would suggest reading this book first, if you haven't ever read anything by Fr. Groeschel.  Or, if you've read a great deal of his work but missed this earlier book, be sure not to pass it up--again I say it is a treaure!re not to pass it up--again I say it is a treaure!	2005-08-09

The culmination of this great trilogy by Gingrich & Forstchen is every bit as spectacular as the beginning.  How I wish it had been a long series, because now we have to bury Lee and Grant once more.  I hated for this book to end.  The trilogy began with the novel \\"Gettysburg,\\" where an alternate outcome to the famous battle launched a victorious Confederate Army down a different path.  In Never Call Retreat the Civil War is fought to a heart-wrenching conclusion two years early.  I am being careful not to give away too much of the plot because I enjoyed immensely not knowing how it would end.<br /><br />By the time you read this final book the characters are like family.  The characterization is that good.  You get more than just historical research; I think the authors really had a feel for the hearts of both Lee and Grant.  We also got a good inside look at Lincoln, Longstreet, Stuart, and some of the lesser characters.  The dialog in particular is brilliant.  I found the story to be entirely believable.<br /><br />Short chapters alternate between North and South perspective.  This is very effective storytelling.  I was so engrossed in the story and found the characters on both sides so sympathetic that I alternated right along with the chapters, first rooting for one side then the other!  I've read a great deal of nonfiction about this war, and no matter how many true accounts you read, you are constrained by history to always reach the same inevitable conclusion.  The best thing about this alternate history trilogy is that you are reading about the same guys doing the same things but you don't know how it will end.  The ending was, incidentally, extremely well executed, and you feel as though you're reading what actually happened.<br /><br />Did I mention that I really loved this book?  I read 25-30 books before I find myself compelled to take time to write a review.  In this case I had to share my enthusiasm with others with the hope that you, too, might enjoy the long, armchair battle of a different Civil War!ight enjoy the long, armchair battle of a different Civil War!	2005-07-23

I actually read Flynn's 2nd book, Transfer of Power, before this one.  I didn't think any thriller could equal that one, but Term Limits is every bit as good.  The plot is intriguing.  Now some reviewers have gotten \\"up in arms\\" about the \\"fascist\\" elements of this book.  Well, I am not reading a fictional thriller to learn about how the government should be run...it is ENTERTAINMENT for heaven's sake, so lighten up.  I found it interesting to try to understand Scott Coleman.  An author's ability to create sympathetic characters, even when they are controversial, shows his talent...especially when it's his first book.  I won't repeat the plot line that every reviewer has already revealed.  I'll just try to help you decide whether or not you would enjoy the book.  The \\"good guys\\" have some very militaristic, drastic solutions to what they perceive as a threat from within the country that exceeds any outside threat.  That is really the premise of the story.  You have to be willing to get into their minds and think, just for the duration of this book, I'm going to accept their values and see where it takes me.  If you can do that you'll love the book.  It is absolutely packed with action from start to finish.  The way the freshman congressman is drawn into the scheme is well done and believable.  The role of the congressman's wife is very strong and it adds a balance to the thinking of the players.  The politicians are so obnoxious that you could kill some of them yourself by the time you finish the book!  All in all, it's a totally engaging read.  Just for the time you have the book in your hands, which won't be many sittings because you'll sit there into the wee hours, you can put yourself in the place of a few guys who feel justified in taking extreme measures to impose \\"Term Limits\\" on the politicians you'll agree were pretty rotten.  By the end of the book, you'll decide that the good guys DID win, even though they were certainly not \\"good\\" in the conventional way!n, even though they were certainly not \\"good\\" in the conventional way!	2005-04-26

He writes for the National Catholic Reporter, commonly known as the National Catholic \\"Distorer\\" because of its extremely liberal slant.  Mr. Allen is clearly no fan of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (at the time it was written), and is no doubt dismayed that he is now Pope Benedict XVI.  I will admit to not finishing this book.  It was so distasteful and disrespectful that I could not read past the first 120 pages, although I really tried to finish it.  I don't like to write negative book reviews, but if an author is so willing to write a negative book like this, he deserves a bad review.  If Pope Benedict XVI were a dissident who was trying to distort the teachings of the Church, I could understand someone's writing a book to point out his errors.  But there are no theological errors Allen can point to here...he can only pontificate his liberal views as though he had authority or even credibility.  Not recommended.	2005-04-26

I bought Every Man for Himself because I LOVE tales about the Titanic.  When I read the reviews on the back cover, I expected to be as swept away as they sounded.

I got so much into this story that it was like traveling back in time.  Eileen is a young Irish woman traveling to America with her beloved husband and toddler son.  Unfortunately, they are on the Titanic!  Eileen is forced into a lifeboat, but her husband and son are tragically lost.  She blames the man she heard yelling \\"Lower Away!\\" It was J. Bruce Ismay, the managing director of the White Star Line, who insisted no men could get on the lifeboats, even though some of them were launched half full.  He himself jumped into a lifeboat at the last minute--after all, there WAS room in it and he didn't want to die.  Eileen is beside herself inside the lifeboat, hoping beyond hope that her husband and child made it into one of the other boats launched after hers.  When she was finally rescued by the Carpathia, she found that they had not been rescued, and was out of her mind with despair, wishing she had not been tricked onto the lifeboat.  Then she saw that the very man who was responsible for her loss was alive and well on the Carpathia.  How could Ismay possibly have doomed so many men to go down with the ship, and then saved himself?  She became obsessed with tracking him down and killing him, no matter what the cost.  The story itself is compelling, and the characterization of this Irish girl was so strong that I just devoured the book.  What a movie this would make!!!  It would be a sensation for sure.  Do yourself a favor and escape with this book...reading it is a terrific experience!	2005-02-16

I read so many books--4-5 a week--and rarely take time to write a review, but I must let others know what a find this book is.  The characterization is phenomenal and the story riveting.  Morgan Fairchild, named for his great uncle J. Pierpont Morgan, is the main character.  Born to wealth, he is determined to make his own way and is responsible almost to a fault.  His strong sense of honor has cost him the love of his life, now engaged to another man...ackwardly, they are all on the Titanic.  I can't even begin to get into the mystery involved, and all the plot intricacies.  I have not enjoyed a book this much in a very long time.  It has every element one could want.

I have read everything Alton Gansky has written, and he is one of my very favorite authors.  His remarkable imagination has led to some truly outstanding novels.  This book was different from his others.  The protagonist is a woman--\\"Maddy,\\" the mayor of a small town.  The first problem I had was in the way this main character was portrayed.  Gansky seems to think that the only thing women do is cry and hug one another.  There were so many tears and embraces that it finally turned me off big time.  I would not be able to stand being around such an emotional person.  But of course I kept reading, because the plot had really gripped me.  I waded through all the tears to find out what would happen next.  The mystery of who was abducting Maddy's campaign workers, and why, was built up nicely.  Obviously someone wanted to destroy Maddy's political future to keep her from running for a higher office.  At least, that is what seemed obvious by the story line.  I started to really get into the book and couldn't wait to see how the story would resolve itself.  Then, all of a sudden at the end, the story took such a ridiculous and unbelievable turn that I was left very disappointed.  Folks, I hate to write negative things in a review; ESPECIALLY when it's a book by one of my very favorite authors.  But This book simply does not stack up to the writer's ability.  I hope Gansky turns back to writing the Stanton books, or ANY of his previous characters instead of this one.  I give it 3 stars because of how well written it is up until the absurd ending.  If you are a Gansky fan who would never miss one of his books, go ahead.  But if you haven't read his books before, don't start with this one--the others are all much better!	2004-11-29

I've just never been too interested in the Orient, and when I saw that the story took place in China, I kept putting other books ahead of this one.  Thank God someone happened to mention how good it was.  I was completely captivated from the beginning.  Li Quan lived and breathed for me...this hero made me really stop to think about courage and commitment to God.  Watching the slow conversion of his visiting classmate from college days was so satisfying.  Li Quan was the kind of man who preaches a sermon silently, through his manner of living and coping with hardship.  The persecution of Christians in China is a sad reality.  I honestly cannot see how anyone could help but love this book.  The story line is exceptional, the characterization is superb, and the message is life-changing.  You simply can't close the cover of Safely Home and not look for a charity that distributes Bibles to the Christians in China.  Another thing you can't do is ignore the message: God may require the supreme sacrifice from those who truly love Him and follow Him with steadfast faith.  Few of us will ever be called to give our lives for our faith, but we must be WILLING to do so.  And it is our eternal destination that really matters.  Safely Home will entertain you immensely, but that is the least of what you'll gain by reading it!  Please do get this book, and pass it along to a good friend after you've read it.	2004-11-29

Believe it or not, it was the Acknowledgements that made me buy Einstein's Bridge.  John Cramer wrote that when the Superconducting Super Collider project was scrapped in 1993, it was a year before he could bear to look at his unfinished manuscript.  I \\"felt his pain.\\"  Those who have an interest in particle physics will especially enjoy this book, although I think any fan of hard sci-fi will be delighted with it.  The characters are great--likable and believable.  The real beauty of this book is its highly original plot.  The backdrop is Waxahatchie, TX, (yes, that was to be the SSC site) in the first decade of the 21st Century--in other words, 'bout now.  Our high-energy physics experiments have attracted notice of two different groups of aliens.  We have the bad guys, who invade and take over other worlds, and the good guys, who empower other civilizations to defeat the bad guys before the invasion can be completed.  They do this by contacting us and teaching us to \\"read\\" and \\"write.\\"  (These words will never have the same mundane meaning to you again after this book!)  There is plenty of good science mixed in with the fiction, and enough twists to keep you wondering how on earth it will resolve itself.  Much to my delight, time travel was even introduced.  I don't want to say more, as it would spoil the plot.  This book takes you along on a great ride--enjoy it!	2004-11-19

I wouldn't have thought all the loose ends and unanswered questions could be wrapped up so nicely in The Revealing.  That alien invasion could be the Great Deception of the Bible is plausible, though never what I had imagined. (I always thought the Great Deception would be secular humanism--and I still think so....but this is still great fiction no matter what your beliefs.)  The aliens are actually demons in this story.  This premise could have resulted in a ridiculously unbelievable book, but that is not the case here.  This is a story you can really get into; a real treat to read.  It is very well-written and action packed.  I can honestly say there's never a dull moment in the whole trilogy.  The characterization was not exceptional, but pretty good for a plot-based novel.  I recommend buying all 3 in the series at once, so you can progress from one to the next without having to wait!	2004-11-10
US	53024515	R34PWHTKZFJU38	0060784156	386956201	Because He Could	Books	5	52	67	N	Y	Brilliant, witty, remarkably insightful, and of course--sad.	First of all, I didn't read this book because I wanted to understand Bill Clinton better.  I have never figured out why people say he is a mystery or an enigma.  The book title \\"Because He Could\\" pretty well sums up Clinton's motivations and character.  His public actions show him to be a weak man with a desperate need for attention and approval...your basic narcissist.  Through luck, intellect, charisma and an insatiable drive for power, this particular narcissist made it to the presidency.  (To me, the much bigger mystery is how people could vote him in even once, much less twice.)  So why did I buy the book?  I think Dick Morris is a brilliant political researcher and strategist whose grasp of the political climate is right on target 99% of the time.  I wanted to see what his writing was like.  I wasn't surprised to find that his writing style is witty and crisp.  I thoroughly enjoyed Because He Could.  The chapter on terrorism reminded me what a cowardly president Clinton was, always putting political expediency above what he was smart enough to know was best for the country.  His paralysis in the face of difficult decisions was explained very well by Morris, who attributed it to his fear of criticism of his own draft dodging and his pathological need to be popular.  I recommend this book very highly to anyone who is objective about Clinton, whether Republican or Democrat. To those who were taken in by Clinton's charm and remain enamored of him despite his despicable character and overall poor performance, I wouldn't suggest reading a book that rubs salt in the wound.  But most of all, I hope anyone who has a thought of supporting Hillary for 2008 will read this book as well as Rewriting History (which I'll tackle next).  The only negative thing I came away with was wondering how Dick Morris could have stomached working with this man and helping him stay in office...it makes me sadly realize his own character couldn't be too swift.  Maybe he's changed for the better, as all of us can, and this book is a testament to the better man.  I think I'll enjoy reading more of Dick's books...he is singularly qualified to write on the subject.tter, as all of us can, and this book is a testament to the better man.

The premise of the story was so great.  The problem starts when you start reading the vile language with a four-letter word in every sentence.  The women are the most profane and explicit in their language and actions.  I kept trying to find a main character.  It looked like I had found one--a lesbian with a chip on her shoulder, but then she disappeared.  Honestly, there was not one likeable person in the book.  I kept hoping the plot would make up for the liberal manifesto (like the USS Hillary Clinton, named after the \\"greatest\\" president).  The story was convoluted and disjointed.  Finally, just past half way through the book, I could take no more.  For some reason, the author seemed more determined to show the reader how unenlightened people of the 1940's were, and how liberal and sexually uninhibited the people of the future had become.  I don't like to give a bad review, realizing how much individual tastes can differ...but this book should have a warning sticker on the cover: \\"Only for those who want to see the very worst characteristics of human nature.\\"	2004-11-04

Parshall does a fine job with characterization, creating 3-D likeable characters.  Attorney Will Chambers struggles with internal and external forces to get his life and career back on track.  We end up with a close study of the man plus an intriguing plot and some great courtroom dialog.  I have now read all 4 of the Will Chambers books and can't wait for the next one.  They have each been unique and exciting to read...enough action to keep you up late because you just have to find out what will happen.  This author is a treasure.

The story line was excellent, as with this entire series.  I was very satisfied with the resolution, and now look forward eagerly to the spinoff series about to start.  Living through the horrible cancer was so real--I identified so much with the mother, even though I've never been close to anyone who died from cancer.  I'll never forget this series, and this book in particular.  Yes, it was sad, but also showed the reader how to see the underlying joy.  Most of all, it teaches a lesson about trusting in God's goodness.  I'm Catholic, and my priest always likes to remind us that \\"God is good all the time, and all the time God is good.\\"  This book would serve as a fine example of that kind of faith.	2004-10-27

It represents the very best in high tech action thrillers, not TOO far-fetched, bordering on science fiction.  There is lite romance but this never takes center stage to the raw, exploding action sequences.  The ending was very satisfying, EXCEPT I enjoyed it so much that the whole time I was reading it I hoped it was going to be a trilogy!

I don't like to say negative things about a book--especially one that so many other readers have loved--but since it was those reviews that got me to read the book, I feel I must share my own reaction.  First, the good stuff.  Certainly the main character, Kevin, came to life on the pages.  The plot was exciting and suspenseful, and I'll admit I found it hard to put down.  I was impressed not only with the author's writing ability, but also with the unique and very surprising ending.  If I had been purposefully looking for a book that would scare me with the evil of the antagonist, keep me on the edge of my seat throughout, and catch me offguard with the ending, then I guess I'd be writing how great I found this book.  If this book had been classified as &quot;horror&quot; and written by Koontz or King, I would have thought, yep, that's typical of their stuff.  But I was looking for a Christian novel.  The main character was a student in what was apparently an Episcopal seminary.  Other than that, I saw nothing Christian in the book.  I found it horrific and twisted--DEFINITELY not edifying or uplifting in any conceivable way.  The only &quot;message&quot; if left me with was how sick a mind can get.  I can contrast this unpleasant reaction with how I felt after reading some other Christian fiction, such as that of great authors like Alan Gansky and Randy Alcorn.  When I finished Alcorn's books &quot;Deadline,&quot; &quot;Dominion,&quot; and &quot;Safely Home,&quot; I was blown away by the message and the writing.  I could see where these books might convert the hardest heart who would read them.  In sharp contrast, Three is a horror/suspense novel, and to be honest, I found it distasteful.  I gave it 3 stars because of the writer's talent.be honest, I found it distasteful.  I gave it 3 stars because of the writer's talent.	2004-07-11

The continuity of the story was good and the plot thickens in this second installment.  Once again I found the characterization to be excellent.  The only trifling annoyance to me was the emphasis on Uri's broken English...but this was not enough to downgrade the book.  The idea of Satan and his fallen angels using the deception of extraterrestrials was clever.  Yes, this book is far-fetched, but after all, it IS science fiction.  It's action-packed and well written--altogether quite entertaining.  I am eager to read the 3rd installment in the trilogy.	2004-06-19

I am hard to please in both genres, but Nephilim delivers good &quot;aliens among us&quot; suspense combined with a demonic plot to destroy Christianity.  The main character &quot;Mac&quot; is a middle aged reporter who has lost his faith for the past two years following the death of his son and the breakup of his marriage.  He has fled to the bottle for his comfort, and is on the brink of losing his damaged career entirely.  Mac gets a chance for the story of his career, involving secret government installations and mysterious claims of alien abduction.  He travels to Israel to see the remains of an almost-human giant referred to in the Bible as &quot;Nephilim.&quot;  His lukewarm interest turns into commitment to saving the world.  The characterization is excellent.  The plot is far-fetched, but hey--this is science fiction.  So...get this book and sit back in your easy chair for an enjoyable mini-vacation!	2004-06-17

The author attemps to analyze the character himself in his various roles as soldier, leader, husband, father, private citizen, university president, etc.  The writing style did not please me as much as the content.  It was interesting to see the different facets of the man presented separately and with supporting documentation from Lee's own recorded words and the anecdotes of others.  For those who cannot get enough of Robert E. Lee, this a good addition to the bookshelf.	2004-06-14

I love good time travel adventures, and the Christian backdrop added to my enjoyment of this entertaining &quot;vacation&quot; through time.  I couldn't tell until close to the end that this was slated to become a continuing saga...that's because the author did a good job tying loose ends.  Most everyone has probably AT LEAST ONE big regret that changed the course of his or her life.  That is the main theme of this book, and it is a tantalizing prospect to imagine a reality where you could actually alter the past and do it right.  It pits one man's anguish and obsession with avoiding the events that killed his true love, against the wiser Christian friend and fellow scientist who sees the probable consequences of tampering with the past.  This is a great book for those who can relax, open their imaginations, and enjoy the ride.  I am eager for the next installment!	2004-06-11
US	53024515	RL82DPHFMGJXT	0394520831	29929684	The Long Surrender	Books	5	24	25	N	Y	Good, even-handed account of Davis' flight	The Long Surrender is a good book with the wrong title, because Jefferson Davis certainly did not surrender.  This book chronicles the events beginning in April of 1865, when Lee surrendered and Richmond fell.  Jefferson Davis and his entourage fled with the remaining treasury.  The author gives a well-researched and even-handed account of the flight of Davis.  It captures his determination to somehow rally the remaining forces and continue the war, despite the advice of his generals.  I bought this book because I wanted to understand Davis better and learn what is known about his postwar days.  It's a bit dry, but nevertheless interesting.  Davis spent two long and miserable years in confinement, and was treated inhumanely by his captors.  It recounts the anguish of his wife and her efforts to obtain at first better treatment and finally his release.  The book is chock full of little known facts about this dark period of history.  It gives a fairly detailed accounting of the Confederate treasury and the personal funds of Davis.  There is no glossing over the flaws in judgment and intransigent attitute of Jefferson Davis, but the book also illuminates his courage, conviction, and many good qualities.  For those who want to see the bitter end of his &quot;presidency&quot; this book is a must.	2004-06-10

If Gettysburg was phenomenal, I am at a loss for adjectives after just completing Grant Comes East!  I've read a lot of Civil War novels, and this was the best since The Killer Angels.  Even though this was a novel, and alternate history at that, the realism was astounding!  The portrayals of Lee, Grant, Longstreet, Lincoln, and Sickles were especially true to character.  I found the entire premise to be plausible, the politics so insightful that I almost felt THIS was the way it really happened.  There was no wild speculation or far-fetched theories to live with in this book.  &quot;Gettysburg&quot; began the story, with the slight detour that made all the difference--Lee listened to Longstreet, formulated a better plan, and avoided the fateful defeat at Gettysburg.  This worthy sequel took the war down a different path, and absolutely every aspect was handled masterfully.  Gingrich and Fortschen make a great team.  I hated for the book to end, but was elated to see that it's not over...there has to be at least one more masterpiece forthcoming.  Newt, please stay off the talk shows long enough to write the next installment, because I CAN'T STAND THE WAIT!!!	2004-06-03

Time travel is a favorite topic of mine.  I've read so many I've lost count.  This one stands out in that it is very heavy on science and theory.  If you like to ponder the possibilities and ramifications of communication across time, this book will appeal to you as it did to me.  It has an excellent treatment of the paradox dilemma.  One guage I use to measure a time travel novel is believability...Hogan has managed to be creative while at the same time presenting a plausible scenario.  The consequences of altering the future are explored in a satisfying (and believable) manner.  Those reviewers who found the book dull are not people who have spent a great deal of time pondering the theories.  The book involves the reader in trying to figure out the theory, because once the ability to send communication back in time is discovered, the next step is figuring out how it's done and how the paradox situations fit into the equation.  The true nature of time is explored thoroughly.  It is not a book of rip-roaring action, but definitely a book for those who are enthralled by the idea of communication through time.  I found it immensely satisfying.	2004-05-31

I love taking a mental time travel trip and feel I've read most of the genre.  I had just finished Thrice Upon a Time by James Hogan--a very theoretical hard science look at communication across time.  Time lottery was kind of an opposite--light reading from the technical aspect, not believable or even plausible, and very short on theory.  What this book offered was something very different.  The story line dealt with the common regrets that fallible humans accrue in life, and the question of what would you do if you could go back to a pivotal time in your life and choose a different course.  I feel that this theme would appeal to most people--who hasn't wished to have made a different choice somewhere along the line?  Four diverse characters are main players.  Their individual experiences with a &quot;second chance&quot; are chronicled well.  All three time travelers have interesting stories and choices to make.  The fourth main character is the marketing directer who is to be the next &quot;traveler&quot; after the initial three make their decision to either return to the present or stay in their new time line.  The characterization is excellent.  Woven into their very interesting situations is a Christian undercurrent that becomes the main &quot;message&quot; of the book.  Each chapter begins with an appropriate Bible quote.  There are some very valuable lessons in this book, and the author conveys them in a most entertaining manner by using some compelling characters and situations with which we can all identify.  Clearly the author's intent was to impart an important message.  She succeeded brilliantly.  The powerful stories guarantee that the message will not be forgotten.  Bravo!	2004-05-31

It's not that I'm a big horror fan, but a few authors of this genre have exceptional writing talent (Koontz, King, McCammon, Saul) that can really captivate the reader.  The taking is a strange book.  I found the beginning great, but the graphic and gruesome details that followed were not entertaining in my opinion.  The main problem was that the very grisly supernatural phenomenon (faces in the mirror, dead people reanimated in a decomposed state, etc.) did not fit well with the theme of alien invasion.  If a horror or science fiction tale gets to the point of being so unbelievable that it is ridiculous, it's hard for me to &quot;get into&quot; the story.  Also the character development was lousy.  So why did I rate it a 3?  Because the beginning was superb, and the ending was very surprising and satisfying.  This book is not a waste of time by any means.  I might judge a Koontz book by higher standards simply because he is capable of such greatness.  This was an okay but not excellent novel.	2004-05-28

I love hard science fiction (NOT fantasy) and time travel is my favorite theme--when it's done well.  Transgression is truly a remarkable mix of science, adventure, history, religion, and even romance.  The balance is perfect.  This is the first book I've read by Ingermanson, but now I'll read the others for certain.  I do highly recommend Transgression--reading it is like taking a vacation into the past.  As a Catholic, I enjoyed the Christian slant to it.  I really can think of no criticism--definitely 5 stars!	2004-05-17

The plot is complex and very well executed.  The characters come alive--it's very easy to identify with them.  It's just a tad far-fetched, but hey--it's FICTION.  If you have a modicum of imagination and a love for adventure, this is for you.  One more thing...as a Catholic I enjoy Myers' Christian slant, but I truly believe this books transcends the Christian fiction genre and can appeal to anyone and everyone.  Also, I noticed some reviewers referred to the violent content.  For anyone who reads adventure stories, this book is pretty gentle in my view when it comes to violence.  I heartily recommend it as one of Myers' best!	2004-05-17

Even I was surprised at how good Beneath the Ice was, and I'm a great fan of all Gansky's novels.  I've read a lot of arctic adventure stories--this is right at the top.  Some avid readers of techno-thrillers who like authors like Rollins or Reilly, don't give Gansky a try because he is a minister who weaves Christianity through his books.  This is a shame, because he tells a great story with plenty of technical detail, great characterization, and a compelling plot.  As a Catholic, I think the Christian aspect of his writing is a big plus...but I still think his books are for anyone and everyone.  The character of Perry Sachs is a winner.  I hope Gansky writes more of these, and expect that he will.  Beneath the ice just might be Gansky's best book.  The action never stops...there are no loose ends...the ending is very satisfying.  What more could you want?	2004-05-17

I have always held Newton in awe, and wondered what his IQ might have measured.  Perhaps what I was looking for in this book was not the author's intent in focus.  I've read many scientific books that detail the theories and history of Newton's contributions.  In this book I hoped to find more of an inner glimpse into Newton's psyche.  What it did reveal was disillusioning--Newton was apparently petty, jealous, and socially inept.  For those who are looking for a biography, this doesn't cut the mustard.  For those who are not already familiar with the scientific thought of the day and with Newton's accomplishments, this book will be much more satisfying.	2004-05-17

Sure it was unbelievable...geez...why pick up an action thriller if you want a documentary?  Ice Station was definitely action-packed, and the characters were well drawn, especially for a first novel.  I won't recount the story, as that's been done over and over, but will rather point out what I found enjoyable.  The main character was likeable.  The setting was exciting--I love arctic adventures.  I felt like reading this book was a brief vacation from day-to-day life.  It held my interest from beginning to end.  I did notice the grammatical errors, but my purpose in reading it was to have a good time, and that I did!  I notice that readers of this book also read Rollins--I'm certainly one of those.  If you can set reality aside and allow your imagination to roll with the book, you won't be disappointed.	2004-05-15

It really focused more on Dr. Trenton's alien encounter than on time travel mechanics.  A quirky scientist, who had been prominent in time travel research when he disappeared 20 years ago, suddenly reappears and is placed in a government facility for treatment and evaluation.  The book is written in interview form, as a psychiatrist tries to help him remember and recount what happened when he used his time machine.  Through miscalculation and lack of understanding of the nature of time, he ended up stranded on a strange planet.  This sounds silly, but somehow it is presented so well that it's almost believable.  It is most certainly entertaining.  This author is obviously highly imaginative and immensely creative.  If you enjoy time travel stories, you'll find this one breaks the mold.  I recommend it highly for those who enjoy an imaginary jaunt through both space and time, and who are not afraid to meet an alien who is not so alien once you get to know him!	2004-05-06

Reading it is like taking a vacation to another world!  I love time travel stories, but am hard to please.  They must be believable--well, at least to those with some degree of imagination--and the science must pass the giggle test.  Twilight captivated and delighted me from start to finish.  It's the story of an AF pilot on a mission in the Middle East (plausible, right?) who is shot down.  Just before he crashes to a certain death, a mysterious stranger suddenly appears on the plane with him and virtually snatches him out of the plane.  He is transported to an in-between time and space realm called Twilight.  There he begins training to become a time-skimmer; one who travels in time to right injustices.  This is a great book, and I heartily recommend it.	2004-05-05

Stanton book	I don't think Gansky can write a bad novel, and his J. D. Stanton ones have been the most exciting.  This was the 3rd Stanton novel, and not quite up to the 5-star rating of the first two.  I loved the premise--anything involving time travel really intrigues me.  Gansky handled it well.  The &quot;out of time&quot; part of the story seemed more believable to me than the unlikely cast of teenage characters.  To me this was the only downside to the book.  I could not identify with any of the youngsters (never knew a teen remotely like any of them) but the main adult characters are well drawn.  Also, I expect so much of this author that any minute flaw in the story is noticed, so maybe I am overly critical.  Out of Time did have a satisfying ending, and I was definitely glad I had read it.  I still wait eagerly for any new Gansky novel and pre-order it sight unseen!	2004-05-05

No one could read the first chapter and not finish this book!  I savored every page of it from start to finish.  Brian Greene has a unique combination of talent that you JUST DON'T SEE in such an outstanding scientific mind.  1) He can write!  2) He is clearly one of the top physicists in the field of Superstring/M-Theory.  3) He is a born teacher.  4) Did I mention he can write?  Through brilliant use of analogy, Greene makes the most mind boggling concepts easy to grasp.  This is a book for lay people, as evidenced by the absence of equations in the text...they are included in the notes section at the end along with more robust theoretical details.  The book takes you through the usual history of quantum physics and cosmology, as it must do to provide the background necessary to understand where we are now.  He moves from the earlier understandings to the most current developments in a manner that makes very difficult subjects accessible to everyday people.  The question of why the arrow of times moves relentlessly forward is answered in this book, and that is no mean accomplishment.  In fact, the infusion of knowledge is so gentle that after 500 pages I was amazed at how much was covered and even more amazed that I understood it.  The subject matter itself is fascinating.  Greene's writing ability makes it enjoyable at the same time.  His injection of humor put the icing on the cake.  A small example: &quot;...Ordinary experience confronts us with two types of phenomena: those that have a clearly delineated beginning, middle, and end...and those that are cyclic, happening over and over again (the changing seasons, the rising and setting of the sun, Larry King's weddings).&quot;  Now some might find his highly imaginative analogies can get a bit corny, but I saw them as brilliant--and they do the job of illuminating complex ideas.  I really can't recommend this book highly enough to those who want to learn!  One last thing...you can read the whole book without consulting the notes at the end.  This is great for continuity and readability.  Just don't fail to read the &quot;Notes&quot; section when you finish.  It serves as a brief refresher to cement the new ideas into your head, and expands on the more complicated concepts.

I think the thing I admire most about Rollins is his superb imagination.  He manages to make unbeliveable plots seem factual.  What a talent!  The &quot;things never meant to survive or be found&quot; were wrapped in enough scientific plausibility to allow the the reader to engage completely in the story.  Also Rollins created a very interesting array of characters who work well together in all aspects.  I never miss a Rollins book, for the simple reason that his batting average is so darn good.  His novels range from very good to spectacular--this makes me await eagerly each new book.  If you like LOTS of action, suspense, narrow escapes, some who DON'T escape, original plot lines, and likeable characters, you really can't go wrong with a Rollins story.	2004-03-08

I do think the story was about played out, though, and it was good to come to the conclusion.  It could have been more satisfying but overall the imaginative plot carried me through without tiring of it.  This was an unusual series for me, because I do not like fantasy but do like believable, near-future science fiction.  It managed to convey just enough believabilty in the beginning to snare me.  This made me more tolerant of the fantasy elements.  Certainly I would recommend reading these books in order and not skipping any, as the story is progressive.  It is good entertainment.	2004-02-28

The Last Juror is written in a nice, first person, very conversational style.  It is believable.  It has a positive social message.  There is some clever humor woven into the tale.  Those are the good things.  The bad things are not so much bad as just a bit dull.  The book is definitely not a page-turner.  There are no surprises or twists to the story at all.  The characterization is as unremarkable as the plot.  Still, I read the whole book, so it wasn't THAT dull.  If you are a die-hard-read-everything-Grisham-writes person, you'll want to get this and read it.  But if you are looking for the kind of writing you'd find in Mystic River by Lehane, for example, you will be disappointed in this book's lack of it.	2004-02-16

This scholarly book may not appeal to those who want to see sensationalism, but for the reader who wants to read the definitive book on Catholic end-times belief, this is it.  Desmond Birch backs up his every conclusion with sound theology.  Clearly he has spent a lifetime studying not only scripture, but many obsure Church documents from the early Church.  He makes one of the best arguments I've seen for the teaching authority of the Church, which he presented simply as background to understanding the role of Mary in the early Church and today.  He is neither gullible nor superstitious, and is unabashedly aligned with Rome--only Church approved apparitions are covered.  One of the asides in the book was tremendously meaningful to me personally: Birch pointed out how just about every heresy in history was directly related to a lack of devotion to Mary on the part of the founder of the heresy.  After laying all the bricks for a better understanding of apparitions, he discusses in great depth the content and implications of the messages.

Phenomenal is the first word that comes to mind to describe this roller coaster.  I once read that to write a great novel novel, you have to keep the protagonist in trouble, trouble, trouble!  It couldn't have been done any more effectively.  The beginning development was very believable, and a sympathetic character emerged.  I liked the author's writing style immediately--he is FUNNY!  Even as the book turned into a deadly serious game of suspense, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the clever turns of phrase.  The plot itself has been detailed ad nauseum in these reviews, so I'll not repeat what you could read on the &quot;book flap&quot; but will say that it TRULY is impossible to put down.  I read it in one sitting because I couldn't tear myself away.  Now, if you're expecting a man's moral awakening as he learns his lesson...sorry, that is not the direction you're going in this book.  And if you're expecting the totally plausible beginning to continue in the same way, forget about it, because this tale becomes so unbelievable you'll have to snicker at how ridiculous it is...but you'll keep reading.  This is one to get under your belt for the sheer enjoyment of the ride.  Derailed is great fun.  Make a big pot of coffee before you begin, get comfortable, and start the book that will keep you wide-eyed all night!  I only wish I still had it ahead of me to enjoy.	2003-10-25

I was dubious about buying it, but luckily curiosity got the better of me.  Winik is the kind of writer who is so completely conversant with his subject matter that he can wander all over the globe (which he does) and you just can't get enough of it.  April 1865 was a nice change from the blow by blow descriptions of each battle I've been reading lately, as I try to learn more about the Civil War.  This book did more to explain the big WHY to me than anything I've read so far.  All the main players and then some are portrayed as complete human beings.  I found every paragraph interesting and came away admiring Winik almost as much as I did some of the great generals in our country's history.  The book is a fascinating survey of the war's end, with so much background thrown in that everything is put neatly into context.  What a tremendous accomplishment!  I thoroughly recommend it.	2003-10-25

Lee the man, will be delighted with the insights into his family provided by author Coulling.  Lee was an exceptional leader, but his role as a father was even more revealing of his loving nature and the nuances of his personality.  In my opinion, this book does a lot to demystify Lee.  I do not see him as such a complex and mysterious individual as some historians have labeled him.  His consistency is especially evident in this chronicle of family life.<br />Apart from Lee, the book focuses extensively on the lives of the daughters.  Each daughter is portrayed as a complete person, and their individuality is celebrated.  One can learn quite a bit about Mary Lee the mother, too, and even the grandparents who were so deeply loved by the girls.  The sons are not ignored, either.<br />There is an overcast of sadness about the story, at least I felt a little sad, because they did have a difficult life.  It's true that the Lee family was prominent in society and certainly they can be seen as privileged, but these privileges carry their own burden.<br />I highly recommend The Lee Girls to all those who want to escape to the past for awhile and enter into the Lee household.	2003-10-16

Don't expect breathtaking adventure here, but rather sit back and enjoy a view of this young girl coming of age in the 1850's.  My strongest reaction to the book was, &quot;How I would have loved to know Agnes!&quot;  She really does come alive here with exuberant spontaneity.  Her writings provide many glimpses into the overall family life and way of thinking about her life.  Agnes' love for her family is intense, and it can make the reader jealous of such closeness, rarely seen in today's society.  I do recommend this book to those who want to know about General Lee's family life, and those who are interested in knowing more about this delightful girl, taken from the world by illness at age 32.	2003-10-16

US	53024515	RQ47Z7RP4J984	0395929741	465312798	Lee: The Last Years	Books	5	12	13	N	Y	Great writer, great historian and great biographer!	Flood has produced a masterpiece that reveals the personality and character of Lee more than any book I've read.  Lee's tremendous contribution to society after the war is presented in such an enjoyable, readable manner that each revelation unlocked about the inner man becomes a delight to the reader.  I read this book in two sittings because I was so entranced by it.  The author does not write from a hero-worship perspective but rather allows the facts and anecdotes of Lee's family life speak for themselves.  It is for the reader to conclude that Lee had one of the most fully integrated characters a man can possess--honor, self-discipline, love of his Creator, humility, regard for all people, and an innate sense of fairness and reason.  Lee lived only five years after the war but these years were spent performing maximum service to the South and to the US at large.  It's a shame that so many books about Lee focus mainly on battle strategies and have the agenda of supporting the lost cause or revisionist view of why the South lost.  If you are interested only in battle statistics and strategies, this book may not excite you, but if you want to really know the man himself, don't miss this treasure of a book.	2003-09-27

For those who are really into Civil War history--and I've caught the bug recently myself--you will appreciate this rare departure from the inevitable outcome of the War.  Haven't you read many differing accounts of the same battles, lamented the tragic mistakes and felt a bid sad knowing how it all must end?  That is what makes this book so special.  It's a novel, yes, but heavily researched and steeped in fact, particularly about the character and personality of Lee and other notable figures from the era.  Robert E. Lee is the main character of the book.<br />Toward the end of the war, after Gettysburg, things are looking very bleak for the Confederacy.  Lee knows his chances of victory are diminishing but he refuses to give in to despair.  Suddenly, a mysterious stranger is brought to him, who wants to demonstrate a new weapon that he claims will change the outcome of the war.  Lee is intrigued by the boastful claims and naturally interested in a &quot;repeater&quot; rifle perhaps even better than that of the North.  Imagine his reaction to seeing the demonstation of an AK-47!!!  It is too good to be true.  The man tells Lee he can supply his army with ample AK-47's and ammunition to turn the tide of the war and ensure victory.<br />I must point out here that this book is so well written by Turtledove, the master of alternate history, that every bit of the story seems perfectly believable.  The excellence of the plot is exceeded only by the superb characterization.  It is classified as science fiction because the mysterious man and his entourage have come from the year 2014 to change the course of history.  Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, there is increasing evidence that these men may not be the benefactors they portray themselves, but rather have a frightening agenda of their own.<br />There is nothing &quot;way out&quot; in this story, in my opinion.  It is so masterfully written that there's never any thought of &quot;Oh, c'mon...this is ridiculous!&quot;  This is one of the best novels I've ever read.<br />I don't want to give away ALL the plot, but one more thing I must bring up is that the book extends beyond the war to the formation of the new Confederate States, and guess who ends up running for president to succeed Jefferson Davis?<br />Add to all this a fully satisfying ending, and you have a book you'll close with a smile, and a wish that it could have been...This is one of the best novels I've ever read.  <br />I don't want to give away ALL the plot, but one more thing I must bring up is that the book extends beyond the war to the formation of the new Confederate States, and guess who ends up running for president to succeed Jefferson Davis?<br />Add to all this a fully satisfying ending, and you have a book you'll close with a smile, and a wish that it could have been...	2003-09-25

I could have done without the numerous times the author explains in detail about the bloating of the bodies and how the bacteria cause it....it was brought up so many times I thought he must be a bit morbid.

It seemed best to read his own account before tackling the biographies out there.  I'm glad I decided to do it that way.  Reading the accounts of battle in Longstreet's own words has given me a much better understanding of his intellect and character.  Although certainly flawed, he hardly seems the cause of all ills as some wish to portray him.  I thought his explanations surrounding Gettysburg were compelling.  Also, his written communications showed a keen mind and a leader who wanted no chance of his directives being misunderstood or ignored.  (No verbage such as &quot;if practicable.&quot;)  If Robert E. Lee had communicated a tad more like Longstreet, who knows whether it might have helped avoid some of the failures of those who may have known his follow-up would be weak.<br />There is no mention whatsoever of his wife...Longstreet does not focus at all on any family or personal matters.  Yet much of his personality is revealed through the reading.  I wouldn't have missed it for the world...highly recommended.	2003-09-16

Reading this book took me only 2 evenings, and it felt like having the author in my living room.  I'm not a scientist.  I didn't even know there was a difference between life expectancy and life span.  Life expectancy has increased because of the percentage of children who now survive to adulthood thanks to medical advances.  The human life span referred to in the Bible as threescore and ten (and sometimes fourscore) has really never changed.  Until now, or almost now.  We are on the brink of understanding cellular processes that cause what we know as &quot;aging&quot; to occur.  The author explains in very clear terms the present theories of aging and the research efforts now underway.  He also delves into all the moral quandaries involved...this was the area that prompted me to read the book.  I wanted to know more about embryonic stem cell research and cloning, and why pursuing these technologies is or is not justified.  I am Catholic!  The author tries to be civil about religious viewpoints, but can barely manage.  His viewpoints are always 100% secular and ammoral.  Nevertheless, he presents the arguments of all, and makes his case is a logical manner.  I do recommend this book for the nonscientist who wants to explore these issues and pick up a good deal of knowledge about how the research is being done.	2003-09-09

Richard Adams' brilliant book Traveller is like his other animal novels only in that Traveller thinks and talks to us.  This is more of a Civil War chronicle, told from the unique perspective of General Lee's famous horse.  The history is not tampered with in the least.  In fact, I think a strong familiarity with Civil War history and Robert E. Lee in particular is almost essential to a full appreciation of this book.  The subtle nuances are there to delight the reader who recognizes them!<br />So many people have written about General Lee, and the battles fought.  There is enough great nonfiction and fiction about this subject to keep an avid reader occupied for a good long time.  But Richard Adams has found a way to bring something new to the Civil War...what an accomplishment!<br />If you have always been intrigued by the lore of Robert E. Lee, and can let your imagination run free, you are in for a tremendous treat.  The story is still sad.  The human suffering of the war is graphically portrayed, and the misery of the horses is given its due as well.  I absolutely hated to approach the end of the book, because I knew how it had to end.  But Adams' treatment of the end of the War and the end of Lee's life is perfect.  In fact, the last sentence of the book by itself renders it worth your time.	2003-08-31

It does indeed bring him to life, but is this the real Robert E. Lee that's been resurrected?  The author certainly takes complete liberty to speculate on his inner thoughts.  She no doubt got a lot of it right.  But...I took issue with some of her revelations.  For example, she suggests in the book that Lee had at least one extramarital affair and that it was known to Mary Lee, who never quite forgave him.  There is absolutely no evidence that Lee ever dallied, and to the contrary, all evidence suggests that he never did.  I didn't care for this aspect of the book.  The man is dead...why sully his character?<br />The major disappointment for me was that I imagined this was going to be a time-travel story.  Since I had enjoyed Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South&quot; so much, I couldn't wait to tackle this book.  It was like an airplane that never got off the ground....just rolled along and along and along.  It turned out to be a very unlikely story of a very neurotic and immature girl and some weird supporting characters.<br />Okay, now that I've bashed the book terribly, let me compliment it.  It is highly imaginative.  The author is obviously a capable writer, and this is a worthy effort.  I just had a different expectation coming in.	2003-08-31

I gave it 4 stars because the entire book was engrossing--never a bit dull.  He claims to be middle-of-the-road between the extreme views of Lee.  I think he leans quite a bit toward the detractors.  Much of his portrayal of the inner man is speculative, in my opinion.  While he may well have gotten most of it right, I don't think Thomas has Lee &quot;all figured out&quot; as much as he seems to think he does.  His is another opinion on the field of many such.  That said, Thomas has delved into the details with extreme scrutiny.  You can see that he really tries to be fair.  I think maybe most of my disappointment is that I had hoped this book would make Lee less a mystery, and it did not, not for me anyway.<br />I do highly recommend this book, not only because it has excellent scholarship, but also because it's a pleasure to read--a most difficult combination!	2003-08-31

Gettysburg is a fine novel, rich in history, and to me it was sooo believable!  In fact, I kept asking myself, why didn't Lee really make those very decisions?<br />I've read a lot of great, good, and so-so Civil War novels...this one borders on great, and I gave it 5 start for the sheer enjoyment it gave me.  Definitely it SCREAMS for a sequel.<br />Alternate history that follows closely true history with a key change is a treasure to find.  Gettysburg is a great example of such a book...I'd love to see more from this winning team of Gingrich/Forstchen!  If ONLY they would write a novel based on the moment that General Winfield Scott asked Lee to head the Union Army, and Lee said he'd think about it...when he submitted his resignation, Scott told Lee he was making the biggest mistake of his life.  What if Scott had talked him into it and Lee had joined the Union instead of the Confederacy?  That's a book I'd love to see.  (I'm writing this in case Gingrich and Forstchen ever read the reviews of this book!)<br />Anyway, you cannot go wrong with this book.  It is never boring, highly creative, the characterization is strong, and the subject very intriguing.  And I DO imagine we'll see a sequel.  Enjoy!	2003-08-17

In fairness, I must praise the author's ability to transport the reader back in time...it almost seemed that the book was written in the 1800's.  His prose can be beautiful.  The problem is not with the writing, but with the story.  It is a remarkably gloomy tale of endless negativity and vile people.  The parts which are not disgusting or just incredibly sad are instead boring.  Several times I thought to put it aside, but hung in there to see what would finally be the end of all the misery.  The protagonist, Inman, summed up the book pretty well toward the end, when he thought to himself, &quot;Even my best intentions come to naught, and hope itself is but an obstacle.&quot;  Couldn't even the ending have had a speck of happiness in it?  No chance.  It's ironic that the REAL Civil War novels with battles and gore are not nearly so depressing as this long, drawn out saga of negativism.  To leave this on a positive note, if you want writing that is even better coupled with a great story, read The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara...then go on to read his son Jeff Shaara's novels.	2003-08-15

I read Gone For Soldiers AFTER reading the great Shaara Civil War trilogy, because I wanted to understand the early days of Lee, Grant, and others.  I fell in love with the great General Winfield Scott (Old Fuss and Feathers) who was sort of the MacArthur of that day.  The Mexican American War is not a part of history I knew much about.  It was a fascinating time and battle.  Best of all was the insight into the characters of the men we meet later on, in the Civil War.  I actually recommend reading first the trilogy, Gods and Generals, The Killer Angels, and The Last Full Measure, before reading Gone For Soldiers...you'll appreciate it much more this way.  Also I must comment that in this book Jeff Shaara has really developed into a fine writer who is no longer in his father's shadow.	2003-08-15

The Last Full Measure was aptly named for the great story it told of the last agonizing months of the Civil War.  Jeff Shaara's writing ability shows more development here than in Gods and Generals.  His respect for historical accuracy and for the characters he portrays is evident throughout.  I recommend the trilogy highly as one of the best I've ever read.  I so hated for this to end that I traveled even further back in time to read of Lee in his Mexican War days (Gone for Soldiers) by the same author.  If you want to learn history and enjoy it more than you thought possible, this is a wonderful way to do it!	2003-08-15

Gods and Generals is not on par with The Killer Angels, but then, what is?  Jeff Shaara decided to carry on his father's story by writing this prequel and then following that with The Last Full Measure, about the ending of the War.  Gods and Generals deals with beginnings and develops the characters who we will grow to love as though they were relations.  The battle scenes are realistic and vividly told, with great respect for historical accuracy.  I highly recommend this book.  I'll add that Jeff's later books are even better--he has become a terrific author in his own right.	2003-08-15
US	53024515	R3UYIMB2NP2NZZ	0553582909	199284738	Icebound	Books	5	73	76	N	Y	Wow--what a surprise!	First of all, I'm a great Koontz fan.  He is a superlative writer, and this early book--updated by the author--is an example of his extraordinary talent.  FEW writers can combine great adventure and plot WITH excellent characterization.  Koontz is a master of doing just this.<br />Icebound is a departure from Koontz's horror genre.  This is strictly a techno-thriller.  The action is nonstop--never a dull moment, and all very, very well done.  It is about a group of scientists who are carrying out an assignment in the arctic...very believable scenario, I might add.  As a result of severe weather storm conditions and sub-oceanic quakes, a large chunk of ice breaks off and they find themselves stranded on an iceberg upon which they had implanted explosives scheduled to go off in 12 hours.  There are no American ships that can rescue them because of their distance and the severe weather.  Only a Russian sub on a clandestine mission is close enough and has the ability to possibly rescue the team of scientists.<br />The stories of the men, especially the submarine captain, make you really care about the outcome.  Although Koontz, in his afterword, is humble enough to diminish his technological detail as compared with a Tom Clancy, I found the whole thing so real that I was there!  I love submarine adventures and to me, this numbers with the best of them.<br />Noteworthy is the graphic detail of what it must be like to work in such an extreme environment.  The descriptions of the arctic and the weather conditions are awesome.  Even the death scene where one man dies through drowning is so realistic I could imagine vividly what it felt like to die this way.<br />On top of the natural perils they face, there is a one twisted mind with them who is obsessively determined to commit murder.  This portion of the story is also very well executed.<br />In short (I should have said this some paragraphs back!), I can find nothing negative to say about this story or writing style.  I read it at breakneck speed because it was so riveting.  I heartily recommend this book to not only Koontz fans but to anyone who enjoys a techno-thriller.<br />If you're looking only for a supernatural horror story, this is not the ticket.  But...if you love Koontz's immense talent and want to read an exciting thriller, have at it!read it at breakneck speed because it was so riveting.

This more or less scholarly examination of animal intelligence presents a good argument that animals are unique and very unlike the human beings who want so much to know what they are &quot;thinking.&quot;  Many studies are cited in which initially it appeared animals were using the kind of reasoning we recognize, but after exhaustive research, the results were either inconclusive or pointed in the other direction.  Much of animal behavior is genetic, demonstrates the author, and although they are capable of learning complex tasks, their entire methodology is different.  Language is for people, not animals, despite our desire to believe our pets &quot;understand&quot; us when we speak to them.  They become conditioned through experience to respond to us in the best way to get their desired reward.  Their behavior is entirely goal seeking, and they do develop ingenious ways to achieve their self-serving goals.  The author points out that we should appreciate animals for what they are and not try to view them in terms of how much they are like ourselves.  Animal intelligence, for example, cannot be measured using anything close to the criteria we would apply to measuring human intelligence or learning capacity.  All in all, this was a provocative book that in my own mind at least, laid to rest many of the myths about animal communication.  It was a bit dry at times but held my interest throughout because there were many excellent lessons to be learned.  It's difficult to get outside ourselves and objectively evaluate &quot;beings&quot; that we don't understand.  At least animals are smart enough not to spend much time pondering what we are thinking!	2003-05-25

Cat on the Edge is clever and whimsical.  This is not great literature, but the \\"fun factor\\" is high!  I loved it and have ordered every book in the series.<br />Joe Grey is a typical tomcat who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He witnesses a brutal murder, and is seen by the perpetrator.  The murderer seems to know something about Joe Grey that the tomcat hasn't even discovered himself yet--that he can talk.<br />The \\"characterization\\" of humans and felines is darn good, and the story is engaging if not believable.  If you're ready to kick back and just enjoy a creative journey through the imagination, then this book will delight you.	2003-05-21

In this middle book, we see much more about the aliens.  The authors show a great deal of imagination in presenting beings so foreign to us, and yet with a sense of ethics and emotions that are close to human.  It's an interesting twist that these aliens are not evil, but it comes down to their survival or ours.  The characterization of the humans is fair but not great.  This is definitely a story of plot, not characterization.  There is no great moral message that I've seen so far.  I give the book 4 stars for two reasons.  First, the creativity and great plot line begun in the first book of the trilogy keeps the reader eagerly pursuing the outcome.  Secondly, reviews indicate that the third book, which I'm about to begin, is satisfying and better than this second book.  All in all, I think any science fiction fan will like this series.  It is set in the near future, making it more \\"real\\" than the far-out stuff you can try to wade through.  It seems plausible that these things could happen.  Enough writing--I'm headed for the couch to begin the next iteration!	2003-05-14

I just finished reading The Tenth Planet and rushed to write this review.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  The aliens were truly alien, instead of the usual different-appearance-but-almost-human brand that's so common.  They weren't even evil, but clearly they and we cannot coexist.  Their depiction was extremely thoughtful and creative.  As for the humans, if the plot were not so fantastic and the action so riveting, I might say the characters could have been developed a little better.  The lack of depth seems to be par for the course in this type of Sci-Fi thriller, so I'm not so critical as some.  Also, it didn't bother me in the least that this book had no conclusion--it's a trilogy!  Anyone reading reviews now can buy all 3 books at once, and not lose a precious moment waiting for next release!

Not so.  Peter Kreeft is an outstanding biblical scholar and theologian who provides ample references to biblical passages, writings of philosophers and Church fathers, and alternate views from other religions.  Kreeft did as good a job with this as anyone I've ever read.  He presents extremely logical and biblical arguments for the Church's teachings on the afterlife.  He also offers very thought-provoking ideas about the nature of a soul and of Heaven and Hell.  The question and answer parts are very satisfying--issues are examines with great depth.  I especially enjoyed his treatment of time itself...what is the meaning of &quot;eternity&quot; and how is it experienced?  I found it easy to accept all the author's conclusions, and the book's message was uplifting on top of being informative.  In short, here you have it all--a scholarly look at the subject and a message of hope and joy.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone who has pondered our eternal future!	2003-04-23

A modern day city is inexplicably cast into the past (guess what year?) and must contend with one 17th Century catastrophe after another.  Alternate history books are great, but the greatest of all is when the present and past are mixed together like this.  The action is nonstop, and the characterization is superb.  I couldn't read it fast enough, and after about 50 pages, I ran to the computer to order its sequel, 1633.  I am not an expert in history, so I'm not saddled with the need to pick apart whether there were any errors or not.  I just simply enjoyed every page of this fantastic escape.	2003-04-13

This one was written in collaberation with David Weber, but I detected no break in the excellent writing style.  1633 takes the story further and develops the political alliances and relationships between the Americans and the Europeans.  The naval war battles are graphic.  I found it easy to fall into this story, and felt like I was there myself.  That's the best test of good writing for me--complete absorption in the plot and characters.  I can't wait for the promised 1634--the Baltic Wars.  I highly recommend this book...there's something for everyone in it!	2003-04-13

Book #4, thought to be the \\"finale\\" actually will be followed by two more books, accourding to info in the author's website.<br />Atlantis Gate is very full of action, and is an  excellent continuation of #3, Devil's Sea, which was also a great read.  I recommend starting at the beginning with Atlantis, then reading Burmuda Triange, then Devil's Sea, and then this one--Atlantis Gate.<br />As I stated in my review of Devil's Sea, the story is far fetched, but hey, this is science fiction!  It's a magnificent journey into another realm.  I was so captivated, I read it in one sitting.<br />The characterization is really quite good for a science fiction action novel.  The main character--Dane--is immensely likeable, and he's surrounded by other interesting characters.  The parallel story line between the distant past and present made the book even more fascinating to me.  There's also plenty of scientific fact and theory interspersed for plausibility.<br />The book had a satisfying ending, but clearly left room for a sequel, which is forthcoming.<br />I won't try to give a synopsis of the story, since that's been done umpteen times.  I will say that if you want a pure, hard science fiction novel that is completely believable, you might find some of the elements of this story a bit too much.  But, if you're willing to open up your imagination and enjoy the ride, this book is thoroughly entertaining!	2003-03-02

Not that it is short at 295 pages, but that it is so captivating it's hard to put it down.<br />Is it farfetched--yes, but the presentation is such that I found myself accepting the story line and even found it plausible...now that is good writing!  To those who have written in their reviews that some elements of fantasy have been added to a science fiction/action story, well, let's remember that this is fiction!  It's purpose is to entertain.  Judging by the success of this series, I'd say the author has accomplished that end very successfully!<br />The characterization is good for an action thriller.  The story line is the strong point of this book.  I found it impossible not to anticipate with enthusiasm every revelation about the nature of the gates, the shadow, and \\"the ones before.\\"<br />Emily Dickenson once said, \\"What a frigate is a book!\\"  I agree.

I just looked it up to recommend it to someone, and was startled that the whole world didn't give it 5 stars!  In the first place, the story presents a lot of historical truth and background on the ship and its fate.  This gave me that \\"if only...\\" feeling all the way through it.  Serling did a magnificent job of bringing the characters to life.  In my opinion, this book would have made a much better movie than the big hit movie \\"Titanic\\" turned out to be.  There was a real moral to the story in that the treasure seekers sacrificed their values in hopes of recoving riches.  The way the characters from three different time periods came together to form a coherent story was a true feat for the author.  After all this time, I've never forgotten the book.  Recently, I read Passage by Connie Willis, which is an excellent novel dealing with the near-death experience.  In it, the experience of being on board the Titanic is part of the mind's struggle against death.  Reading that book brought this little gem back into my thoughts.  Clearly, there's something about this particular tragedy of history that captivates people.  For anyone who, 1) enjoys the vivid imagination and writing ability of Serling, or 2) who still feels the angst about the Titanic episode in history, or 3) enjoys a ghost story/adventure, there's a lot for you in this book!	2003-02-08

In the first place, the characterization was poor, which is two strikes against it from the outset.  The characters are not likable--for example, the four-letter word vocabulary of the woman &quot;star&quot; was a turn-off to me.

These characters live and breathe, and make you like them (or hate them).  In By the Light of the Moon, the relationship of two brothers is portrayed so beautifully that I wish I could know them.

The first was the Doomsday Book, which was extremely well-written if somewhat depressing.  Passage is unlike anything I've ever read.  The first thing that hit me is that Connie Willis is without a doubt an exceptional writer--a literary genius.<br />The story is captivating and unique.  I know there have been countless novels published that deal with life after death from various approaches, but this is the most scientific, believable treatment of the subject that I've encountered.  Those who hold strong religious convictions such as I (I'm Catholic) may be disappointed that there is no moral lesson or religious message in the book.  In fact, I got the impression that the author is probably an agnostic.  Nevertheless, this book is not anti-religious but leaves a lot of questions open.  Besides--it is a novel, not a book on theology.<br />The rich symbolism, ponderings, mysteries, and superb characterizations make this a remarkable book in my opinion.  It is for people who like to think, and not going to appeal as much to those who are looking for a sensational action adventure or a book that will reinforce their religious convictions about an afterlife.<br />One thing that especially entranced me was the symbolism of the Titanic.  I absolutely marvel at this author's imagination and ability to construct such vivid pictures in the reader's mind.  I felt like I was there.  That is SO RARE in a book!<br />I really recommend this as one of the greats...unless you just want a super-light read with a trite plot and shallow stereotypical characters (the content of most novels), I heartily recommend that you buy this book and curl up on the sofa with it for a most enjoyable voyage.	2002-12-21

His character is further developed, and the story line is equally full of twists and action.  It is top level entertainment with an uplifting message.  I particularly like the way the author, Alton Gansky, ties up all the loose ends.  Many writers fail to do that.  The ending was highly satisfying, and left me with a good feeling for having read it and a wish that the Barringston Relief Chronicles would continue with another book.

After reading Vanished I quickly ordered everything he has written.  Terminal Justice was great...I found it to be full of action, with lifelike characters.

US	53024515	R1QPW6XZDUT2M8	0446611921	269463589	The Millionaires	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Fast paced fun	The Millionaires is a quick moving, fun book.  The characterization of the brothers is excellent.  At first, I wasn't sure I liked the younger brother or the dialog between the two.  It didn't take long before I was hooked on the story line, and then the brothers and other characters really came alive for me.  Even the people who were not likeable were very &quot;real.&quot;  The premise of the story is that because of extenuating circumstances, the brothers are tempted to commit the undetectible &quot;perfect crime.&quot;  Since the crime was depicted as &quot;victimless&quot; it was possible to see the characters in a sympathetic role.  And oh, how they pay for their lapse of ethics!  It's hard to review this book without giving away plot turns that might ruin the reading experience for someone who hasn't yet read the book.  I'm especially tempted to comment at length about the ending and the philosophical conclusions one can draw from it.  I can't do that to someone who has yet to read the book!  All in all, I'd say this is a really fun book, fairly light reading, not too believable but quite entertaining.  The people in the story are memorable.  I'll keep reading and enjoying books by Meltzer!	2002-11-17
US	53024515	R3FMIHD4NUESRD	157673577X	306852563	Danger In The Shadows	Books	3	6	12	N	N	Totally unrealistic romance	I was looking for Christian novels, and after reading some by Gansky, Alcorn and other top-notch writers, I came across the rave reviews for this book.<br />The bad:  It was very low-brow.  I feel it would appeal most to a young teenage girl.  The characters were completely unbelievable, and the plot was beyond unbelievable.<br />The good:  Why did I give it 3 stars?  People who read romances would no doubt enjoy this book.  The pace is fast and there is a great deal of suspense.  It has a happy ending, which is a plus.  It also apparently is like a prequel to the O'Malley series, which begins with the story of the brother introduced in this book.  (I haven't read any of the O'Malley series, but it is evidently popular with the same people who liked this book.)<br />I don't like to write negative things in a review.  My intent is not to discourage anyone who likes romances and extremely easy reading suspense stories from a 100% feminine point of view.  I only want to mention that for someone looking for a serious Christian novel, and who is used to more sophistication than you'll find here, this book would be a disappointment.	2002-11-10

It also treats the issue of euthanasia fairly, showing both pro and con perspectives.  The author and main character are prolife, as am I, so I was happy that the prevailing thought was that euthanasia is wrong.<br />Since reading A Ship Possessed and Vanished by the same author, I hurriedly ordered everything Gansky has written.  Normally I do not particularly care for mysteries.  I have to admit, when you apply Gansky's talent to the genre, you can't lose.<br />The first two books of his that I read (mentioned above) were centered on religion and had a strong Christian message.  Marked for Mercy was more of a mystery where the main character, a very ethical female physician, happened to be a Christian.  If you're looking specifically for Christian fiction, this might not enthrall you as much as Gansky's later books, but if you like mysteries and good writing, this will do very nicely!	2002-10-28

This is the fourth book of his I've read, and have been delighted with the rare combination good characterization along with excellent plot lines.  By My Hands is a mystery if one must classify it; and I have to admit I didn't come close to figuring out how it might end.  It was exciting, full of action, and the resolution was completely satisfying.  I immediately bought the sequel, which I've just started, called Through My Eyes.  (So far, it promises to be excellent as well.)  These two books are only available here in large print, making them pricier than paperbacks, but they are worth every penny.<br />The main character is a minister who has an attack of appendicitis while conducting his church service, and he ends up in the hospital.  The surgeon who performs his emergency appendectomy is a cynical but highly competent woman.  They clash right off the bat.  She is disdainful of ministers and of religion in general.<br />They end up as unlikely cohorts investigating a series of unexplained miracle healings in the hospital.  There are some other interesting and well-developed characters involved, and the story really moves along very smoothly.  To say much more, I'd be ruining the experience of reading this great book for the first time, so I'll just end by saying I highly recommend By My Hands and its sequel Through My Eyes.  Then....go on and read everything you can get ahold of by this writer.<br />I'm a Catholic, by the way, and was nicely surprised that the author, a Baptist minister, does not disparage other faiths in his writing.  That, too, makes me an ardent fan of Alton Gansky.	2002-10-12

I bought this book solely because it was written by James Rollins, and I remembered how very much I had enjoyed his previous book, Subterranean.  I must admit I found this to be another action-packed thriller which entertained me thoroughly.  It's a near future almost science fiction tale that somehow comes off as entirely believable while you're reading it.  If you like high-paced adventure at its best, this book will not disappoint you.  It started out just a bit slow, but after a few chapters I was enthralled by the story and remained on the edge of my seat throughout the book.  The ending was spectacular!  So often, authors fail to tie up loose ends or I am unhappy with the ending situation, but in this case, the ending was as satisfying as the rest of the story.	2002-09-03

The parallel story of the submarine's excapades in 1943 were interwoven beautifully into the modern day discovery of the sub.  It took a long time for them to actually enter the sub after its discovery 60 years later, but the suspense did build and no part of the story was boring.  All in all, this was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  When I'm left with the feeling that it ended too soon, I know I've finished a book that I enjoyed very much.	2002-08-27

In the first book, I was unsure whose side to be on.  Certainly throughout this trilogy, plot supersedes characterization.  Nevertheless, I feel it is much better than the Left Behind series.  The plot line is really, really good.  The message of the story is also excellent.  I'm sure the author was most concerned with making a point, and he accomplished this goal.<br />My only minor complaint is that as a Roman Catholic, I took exception to the almost nonexistence of the Church.  Of course the theology of the Rapture is within 200 years new, and the Church does not interpret scripture the way ths writer presents it.  But I read the book as a novel.  In that sense, it was very satisfying.<br />I would strongly recommend reading all 3 books in the series, as the third book is by far the best.  You will be neither bored nor disappointed in the development and finale.  Also, there is a thought-provoking twist to how the Antichrist is able to deceive the multitudes, convincing the multitudes that evil is good and good is evil.  If I'd have to summarize the moral to this story it would be that \\"The devil was a liar from the beginning.\\"	2002-08-19

Recent books by Dean Koontz have been disappointing, so this was a happy return to the enjoyment I always got from his material in the past.  My one complaint with this book is that all the characters did not congeal by the end of the story.  I had expected them to meet up and somehow become involved with one another at some point.  It never happened.  The story was so good and the characters were so likeable that I really hated to see the story end--it was over too soon!  My hope is that there will be a sequel, which should prove very satisfying.  This book really screams for a sequel!	2002-08-09

I found it a little tedious in the beginning, but further into the book, it hit home with me as no other book ever has.  It is difficult to describe how clearly this book made me see my faults, and how it drove me to amend my life.  The specific practical advice was as timely today as it was in the 1500's.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough, for anyone who is not afraid to take a good look at himself.	2002-02-06

The ones I know haven't tried to &quot;save&quot; me.  One point the book makes well is that Catholics  MUST take the initiative to learn their theology, Church history, and how  the Bible was compiled.  I'm currently reading Why Do Catholics Do That?  and finding it a bit better, in that it focuses more on the issues and less  on the opposition.	2000-06-19

I enjoyed it immensely.  It describes Christ's most difficult battle--accepting &quot;the cup&quot; of our sins.  The allegorical style is very creative,  and it does make one think in more personal terms about the price paid for  our sins as a people.	2000-06-15

Each of the 11 contributors tells a personal story of search and enlightenment.  This would be my book of choice to give to fallen away Catholics or those who are lukewarm about  their faith.  Many people who were born Catholic lack conviction and  &quot;fire&quot; for their religion.  This book is also a great starting  point for those of other Christian groups who have little knowledge about  the Catholic Church's real teachings.  I don't fall into any of these  categories.  I read the book because I do missionary work with people of  mostly Protestant persuasion, and I wanted to understand them better.  So....for many reasons, I heartily recommend Surprised by Truth to anyone  who wants to learn how people think about religion.  Did I mention that the  book is also a delight to read?  The people come alive through their  stories, and this makes the reading much more enjoyable than struggling  through a scholarly work.	2000-06-15

The  author uses creativity while holding to basic biblical teachings.  I wish  the story had been longer and a bit more in depth, as there were some  issues during this period of time that are complex and have been  interpreted many ways.  This is not a series for the serious Bible student,  but it is certainly an enjoyable journey that ends too soon.  I'll  definitely complete the series.	2000-06-05

I was utterly amazed at the depth of insight, the logic, and the fairness demonstrated by Alan Dershowitz's treatment of this difficult topic.  This is a book for anyone who has pondered questions of justice, from a human  and from a divine viewpoint.  Having recently read Just Revenge, Alan's  second novel (highly recommended), I preordered this book knowing it would  be special.  It made me laugh sometimes--if Abraham had possessed the  chutzpah of Alan Dershowitz, who knows how differently things might have  turned out.  Seriously, I found the book extremely well researched and  enlightening.  I'm Catholic, and was especially surprised by the author's  seemingly favorable view of Jesus.  Alan pointed out that Jesus wanted to  make the law more compassionate, but that he contradicted himself by saying  he came not to destroy but to fulfill the law.  I don't feel there was a  contradiction there, because as Alan himself demonstrated, the Bible is a  living document in which the concepts of righteousness and justice evolved  into a more mature understanding as time moved on.  Well...I think that  happened by God's design, and that Christ was indeed the fulfillment of not  only the law, but the unanswered questions.  I halfway expected Alan to  arrive at that conclusion himself in the last chapter, when he discussed  the question of an afterlife.  I only wish Alan Dershowitz were a  Christian, because he would be one of the most moral and effective  evangelists of all time.	2000-06-01

Parts of it were boring, and parts of it were exciting.  As a Catholic, I was offended that the premise of the story was that an order of priests would even conceivably consider  committing the horrific murders of children because DNA from the relics of  saints had been used to conceive them.  It made the Church look terrible,  and I HOPE nobody would believe this kind of thing could really ever  happen.  Aside from that, if read simply as a fictional yarn, the book has  its merits.  The reason I bought it was that the author's later book, The  First Horseman, was so good.  Now there's a great book--much superior to  The Genesis Code.	2000-05-21

It's a clever premise, and well carried out.  The author's great reverence  for God shines through.  Through the fall of man, the close  &quot;hands-on&quot; relationship with God and Heaven is closed off, but  the foreshadowing for redemption is evident.  In the epilogue, God calls  out to Abram, who will of course become Abraham.  At that point, I went  back to Amazon.com and bought the rest of the series!  I recommend The  Beginning because it makes one reflect on the magnitude of sin and how it  grieves God.  The cost of our disobedience is something rarely preached in  church.  Churches more and more preach on God's love and all the positive  things, and try to avoid the controversy of dealing with sin and Satan.  This book will cause you to consider the importance of your day-to-day  choices.	2000-05-18

He is a humble man whose vulnerability to self doubt strikes a chord in many of us who question too  much.  Then again, his holiness shines through, particularly in some of his  dialogues with nonbelievers.  The conversion of the evil old man who at  first tested him in every way then finally called him for his deathbed  confession was, for me, the highlight of the entire book.  This book holds  a strong message; at the same time, it offers much more than theology--it  is also great literature.  I thought the ending was superb.  It begs for a  sequel....let's all hope one is forthcoming!

The characters grab you and transport you to a town where I think, deep down, we would all like to call home. Father Tim is a &quot;real&quot; person with very human characteristics. Yet his basic goodness will restore  your faith in humanity. The theology is not shoved down your throat, but  rather is grasped between the lines. All the characters are memorable.  Cynthia and Dooley in particular help shape the wonderful story line. The  huge dog, Barnabus, who is disciplined only by hearing Bible verse, worms  his way into your heart. I am so glad I discovered this series, and I  recommend it to absolutely anyone!	2000-04-30

The characterization was as excellent as the plot itself, which made reading it all the better.  The book definitely made me seriously  ponder our next presidential election, especially since the next president  will probably end up appointing 3 or even 4 supreme court justices.  I  recommend this book to anyone who likes to think.  I sure hope Hudson will  write more books!	2000-04-22

Yet as I read on, I found myself getting into the characters, then the story.  I have to admit it  completely captured my attention.  Without giving away the plot, I'll just  say I was devastated by the outcome of Part One, but then delighted at the  final outcome at the end of the book.  I heartily recommend this book to  anyone!	2000-04-12

After reading The Edge of Eternity by the same author, and thinking it was one of the finest books I've ever read, I was eager to read another Randy Alcorn book.  Dominion was exceptional.  The characterization was so  intense that every person in the story became almost real to me.  The plot  was as good as the characterization.  On top of that, the message was as  uplifting as anything I've read.  With regard to its treatment of race  relations and bigotry, I think this book should be required reading in  every high school.  That's not in any way to say it's a kid's book.  I  believe that the longer you've lived and experienced the trials of this  life, the more meaningful the book will be to you.  Now, of course, I'll  have to read everything written by Randy Alcorn!	2000-03-29

The writing is brilliant and the message compelling.

After reading and loving Harry Turtledove's World War: In the Balance and Colonization series, a reader recommended the Lost Regiment series to me.  I was completely spellbound by the vivid battle scenes and outstanding characterization portrayed in Rally Cry.  Needless to say, I've ordered the  other 7 titles in the series and can't wait to delve into them.  I can't  recommend this book strongly enough--definitely 10 stars, not 5!

As always, his book had a clever premise, but that's about it.  The characters were not likeable and were really poorly drawn in my opinion.  There was no  believability in the way the plot unfolded either.  Having just completed a  fantastic book by Nelson DeMille--The Lion's Game, which was filled with  excitement from the beginning, Grisham's Brethren seemed a poor offering.	2000-02-25

The plot was sound.  They did a good job of examining the implications of total and immediate disclosure of all events.  The  characterization was poor, however, and I felt the overall outlook on  humanity was negative.  I would hate to live in such a world of  disillusionment.	2000-02-25

I marvel at Turtledove's vivid imagination and uncanny ability to characterize the lizards.  I get so engrossed in his books that they seem utterly real to me.  There are many  characters in the book, some not so likeable as others, but I think he does  a good job maintaining continuity.  As fine as the characterization is,  let's not forget this is primarily a work of plot, and the twists and turns  do not disappoint.  I hated to finish the book, because the wait for the  next installment will seem so long.  This is one series I hope continues  for many more volumes!  I'd appreciate any recommendations from other  readers who love this series.	2000-02-19

This treatment of time travel had some clever technological explanations, but when you've said that, you've said it all.  The characterization was poor and the plot plodded on with very little  excitement.  At the end of the day, I didn't care whether they ever got  back or not.

While Styron's writing is top notch, there was nobody in the book who was normal!  I gave up after 250 pages of weirdness.  I most certainly could not  identify with any of the characters, and the story line, which was  depressing from the start, only promised to get worse.  I read not only for  entertainment, but also to improve my mind.  It was only Styron's beautiful  turn of phrase that kept me reading so long.  Too bad the entire story  centered around such despondency.  There's plenty of nonfiction history  about the concentration camps.  A novel such as this does not, in my view,  provide a compelling enough reason to endure the doom and gloom of wading  through the miserable tale.	1999-09-28

His exploration of all the implications of such technology was very thorough.  This book probably would have been worthwhile just  because of the technology, but as it turned out, the characterization was  excellent also.  It did not make me want to freeze myself, but it sure did  make me ponder the religious, philosophical and practical aspects of human  immortality.  For anyone who likes to think, this is a gread read.	1999-09-16
US	53024515	R3LJ1UN67WENVA	0446519839	892029045	Just Revenge	Books	5	1	4	N	N	Immensely worthwhile!	Alan Dershowitz doesn't know me of course, but he and I have had a love-hate relationship for years.  I was furious with him over the OJ case, and annoyed as all get out with his vocal defense of Bill Clinton in the  Lewinsky scandal.  Yet, never could I turn him off when he'd appear on one  of the legal talk shows.  His mind is phenomenal...no one could ever  dispute the man's intellect and the fact that he has a moral view, whether  or not you agree with his conclusions.  It's always wise to listen to the  man. His first novel, The Advocate's Devil, was very clever and largely  entertaining.  Just Revenge brings back the character of defense attorney  Abe Ringel, in a story that  is as utterly moving as it is  thought-provoking.  Clearly Abe Ringel is the best person inside Alan  Dershowitz; the one he probably thinks he really is, and the one I'd like  to hope is the real Alan Dershowitz.  I think the author completely  accomplished his goal of examining the deepest roots of revenge and  justice.  What questions this book raises!  Anyone who likes to think  should grab this book and enjoy it as the treasure it is. I'd enjoy hearing  from other readers who shared my appreciation for the issues brought up in  this moving novel.	1999-09-05

Although I normally read a couple books a week, I've never cared for the romance genre in the least.  That said, I must  give this book 5 stars, on the basis of its creative story.  I didna much  care for Claire's personality (shrew), but had to admit the  characterization of both Claire and Jaime was well done.  Thankfully, there  was almost as much action as hugging and kissing, or I'd have never gotten  through such a long book.  It was really a great experience for me to read  and enjoy a romance.  I have acquired the 3 remaining books by the author,  and am most anxious to read them.  I can honestly recommend this book to  anyone, as it has much to offer just about any taste.	1999-08-02

It is amazing how a few minutes into this audiobook you feel like you are part of Captain Nemo's crew, traveling around under the ocean. The storyteller for this book-on-tape was clever, the way he used different  accents for all the international characters like Ari, Jackie, Captain  Riley and,of course, Captain Nemo. This Captain Nemo story is one of the  best audiobooks I've heard in years.

The surfer lingo used throughout left me cold.  I also found the unfolding plot so ridiculous that I kept wondering why I was reading the book.  Well, how  can you not read a new Koontz book.  He's written so many outstanding  stories that I was more tolerant than usual, and I did manage to complete  the book.

I disagree with  them; I think think the author had a point to make and wouldn't have wanted  to end the book any other way.  I found A Man in Full to be immensely  enjoyable.  I'd enjoy hearing some recommendations from other readers who  loved this book!	1998-12-05

It would appeal to people who normally do not read books in the horror genre, as well as Koontz's ardent fans.  The characterization is outstanding and  the plot is intricate.  I thoroughly enjoyed every page!	1998-11-27

I normally read 2 to 3 books a week, and I must say this was one of  the most riveting reads I've encountered in some time.  The action is nonstop;  there's absolutely no part of the book one could find boring.  The plot is  clever and unique, and the characterization is excellent.  Add to this a  very satisfying ending, and you have a true winner...maybe that's why the  author chose The Winner as his book title!  I'd enjoy hearing any  recommendations from other readers who loved this book...	1998-11-27

This book was a bit slow at the beginning, but the farther I read, the  better it got.  The writing, plot, and characterization were all excellent.  The most surprising thing to me was that the author made the entire thing  so completely believable.  I think that's a rare accomplishment. This is  the first Patterson book I've read (he seems to write mostly crime/mystery  stories, which I'm not nuts about), and I'm so glad I had the experience.	1998-11-01

Orno was a very sympathetic character, and his antagonist Marshall was a  totally unlikeable one.	1998-10-31
US	53024515	R1EZDA5J1LU2DJ	0684853507	85988614	Bag of Bones	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Excellent writing!	Bag of Bones impressed me with King's ability to write good literature; he  has a depth that I hadn't seen before in his previous novels.  The  characterization is superb.  I would have given this book 5 stars except  that I was disappointed toward the end.  I felt the story deteriorated, and  even got ridiculous at the end.	1998-10-03

Visions should be required reading, not only for students, but for young  and old alike.  Michio Kaku is a brilliant astrophysicist who has applied  the scientific method to writing this book.  It is not the opinions of one  man but a compilation of the thinking of 150 of the world's top scientists.  Visions is loaded with timely topics and is immensely readable.  I cannot  recommend this book highly enough!	1998-09-30

I enjoyed Rebecca very much, which surprised me, since I prefer action  stories and generally dislike books written by women.  There were times  when I wished more would happen, but the author's fine writing made up for  any slow parts.  I can see why this book has become a classic, and I  heartily recommend it to anyone who appreciates fine writing.  Daphne  DuMaurier truly exhibits a rare talent for prose.	1998-09-26
US	53024515	R35TH934S1BPCL	0446606081	198340912	The Ax	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Fast moving &amp; highly entertaining!	Burke Devore, a victim of corporate downsizing, has been out of work for  two years.  He had put in 25 years of loyal service in a specialized field,  as a paper mill manager.  After two years of job seeking, he has become  desperate enough to commit murder.  He conceives a plan to weed out the  competition for the job he wants.  He ends up stalking and killing a number  of people who have better qualifications than he for his dream position.  The premise could be believable, but I felt the author could have done more  to develop the gradual loss of morality in his character.  The reader never  knows what kind of man Devore was before the downsizing.  The story begins  when Devore has already apparently suffered through two long years of  agonizing disappointments.  He has become a murderer in his mind at the  time the book opens. Later into the book, the author does go back and fill  in some of the missing development.  He also shows how the numbing of  Devore's values has affected his marriage and the way he handles the  situation when his teenaged son gets in trouble for burglary.  The book  definitely had a message.  I'm just not sure I liked the message.  I didn't  find Devore to be very likeable, which to me, was the weakness of the  story.  Nevertheless, I think it's a very well-done book, and I recommend  it to those people who will look for a deeper meaning as well as those who  will just read it as an adventure. I'd enjoy hearing from other readers, to  discuss what you thought of Devore's character...	1998-09-13

It would help if Beamon were a more likeable  character.  Mills first book, Rising Phoenix was much better.  I do think  this author will improve, and I will no doubt read his next installment.	1998-09-13

When I read that Swan Song had been oft compared to Stephen King's The  Stand, I decided to purchase it online...particularly after reading all the  rave reviews.  I must agree wholeheartedly that this was an outstanding  treatment of the end-of-the-world theme.  The characterization was  excellent, and the plot kept me engaged throughout the almost 1000 pages.  I will definitely be reading more by Robert McCammon!	1998-09-07

It did congeal in the second half, and  managed to hold my interest until the end.  Koontz can do so much better  than this, that I was disappointed.	1998-09-07

I love his sophisticated  humor.  The plot was believable at first, but became a bit dubious in the  latter half of the book.  I could have wished for a stronger ending, with  the protagonist coming out more of a winner.<br />The Job reminded me of The  Firm by Grisham.  It was good fun!	1998-08-19

Kennedy possesses the ability  to captivate the reader, making the protagonist so very human and likeable  that it's impossible not to root for him throughout.  The plot is lively,  with clever twists.  I like the way Kennedy weaves humor into the story.	1998-08-19

The characterization was excellent, and the story line was exciting.  I also enjoyed the typical Koontz wit which was threaded into the dialogue.  Books like this are so intense that it's hard to move on to a tamer genre after finishing it.	1998-07-26

This book features the same main characters who were introduced in The Enemy Within, and it follows a similar story line.  Bond's technical knowledge makes his writing more realistic.  Although his plots seem a bit unlikely in places, they do entertain.  If you're a Larry Bond fan, or perhaps a Tom Clancy fan, you'll enjoy this new techno-thriller.	1998-06-19

This has to be one of the best books I've ever read, and I read incessantly!  The characterization is excellent, as is the story line.  I hated for the book to end.  I'd enjoy hearing from other readers who loved this book.  For those who felt as I did, you might also try Time And Again by Jack Finney.  - Jackie Tortorella	1998-04-22
