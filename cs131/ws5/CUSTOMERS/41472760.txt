Endo does an excellent job of showcasing the power of christianity without force feeding it the way a western writer would tend to. This story is very subdued and theres never that huge climax that some may expect, instead Endo carries strong points throughout the entire book. I dont quite understand the reviewer who said you cant learn everything about Japan in this book, was I supposed to?	2004-07-07

Not as moving as many but not all classic literature has to be... The reviewer who rambled on (with some of the worst english Ive ever read) had not even tapped into what this novel was about. Wish amazon would keep reviews to one paragraph. Someone with that tough a time describing his dislikes probably should be in school and not online.	2004-07-07

Seems like theres more time spent on desribing the queens dresses  then on action anymore! Of course drama is a huge part of Duncans work but to keep the &quot;Kings Blade&quot; title going I would imagine more then 2 semi exciting battles rather then a whole bunch of mediocre love making talk. Another thing I dont undertsnad is why the stories dont dig deeper into the blades instead of the princess and her past. The first book was still number one in my opinion. i just hope theres more swashbuckling action in the next story instead of the magical thread count in her majesties linens.	2004-05-17

I understand what the writer was trying to do but he failed miserably. You can literally read the beginning sentence of each paragraph and skip the rest. You can read the first chapter and last chapter and be 100% fulfilled witht he story. The writing style is something you would see out of an 8th grader. &quot;the man from the 3rd floor opened the door. the door was brown and big. The kind of door that opens and closes. A door with hinges and a knob. The man walks through. Slowly. As slow as a turtle in slow motion. The man closes the door. The door that is brown and can open and close.&quot;  The End.<BR>Pathetic!	2004-03-17

It's probbaly one of the worst structured books Ive ever read. Its made up as it goes alng. Die hard fans would give 5 stars for anything Rice wrote so dont follow those reviews. I just dont understand how a book about vampires does not fit into horror, action, adventure, drama? It was just a story. It could have been summed up in 100 pages but instead it dragged on and on. The biggest reason I give this 2 stars is because it is narrated the exact same way Louis narrated in Interview. And it's almost like Rice picked up on this as well because over half way through it's like, &quot;oh by the way, Im a loving emotional guy too.&quot; Huh? Its Louis writing as Lestat! <BR>Now I have the next book which continues the story and its twice as long. I only wish I could read as fast as Lestat, but then again I only had to read every other page in this book to know what was going on. I just skipped over the 5 paragraphs it takes for Anne to desribe a grain of sand.	2004-03-15

It explains the battle for stalingrad with great detail and it is non-bias.<BR>Craig has the ability to 'write' which most historians in this genre dont.

At times Browns writing can be almost hardcore sci-fi and other times its amateurish. If the characters seem like their at a dead end you can always expect the word 'suddenly' to pop up. &quot;Robert is stuck with no where to go.But Suddenly, he finds a magic key in his pocket&quot;... I was thrilled at the end of the story, I swore I knew who would end up being the bad guy, but as if Brown felt insecure with the climax he went on and on. Almost trying to justify the end so that he would not offend anyones faith with the conclusion.  If you like movies you'll love this book but dont expect anything too captivating.	2003-12-17

The ideas conveyed through out this work are as thoughtful and mind boggling as it gets. I admit my mental capacity was not strong enough to be able to interpret every word and I feel there was a lack of overall story line.

One thing that niether book 2 or 3 did was follow the Blades! I dont mind the lack of action in this book but they are all called, &quot;tale of the kings blades.&quot; Why?

Seems theres no real reason for this book other then for publicity. Everything is flat except for the over the top mathamatics. I love hardcore sci-fi but if Clarke and Baxter wanted to write a text book, then thats what they should have done. Not hide their views and ideas behind a weak and inferior story. Ill keep catching up with Clarkes past books, but this new stuff is pointless and unimaginative.	2003-06-25

There is no reason for this novel what so ever.  The intrigue and mystery from the first book is no where to be found here and yet the story goes on and on. How can a sequal be double the size of the original anyway?  I'll tell you, poor writing and no structure. The whole story seems to be made up as it goes along.  There are so many chapters in this book you dont even need to read. I never thought Id come across a poor Clarke novel but Im sure it's not all on his shoulders. There are some pretty interesting things in this book but none of it makes for a better overall book. If you need to read this go right ahead, just dont expect another gem (but maybe a plastic pearl).	2002-12-30

Most of the stories are pointless and don't go anywhere. Diehard fans would give 5 stars for anything he released, so don't go by most reviews. I highly suggest you read a few pages of this before purchasing. If you were totally in awl after American Gods, Neverwhere, and Coraline, don't expect that much brilliance in this <BR>collection.

The story has no direction and basically just follows Grendel through various scenes. Obviously Gardner had to follow the story of Beowulf but the ending is so fast that it leaves you wondering what the point of the whole book was. Grendel was interesting and exciting at times, but when you see that the excitement leads to nothing, it leaves you a bit questionable of what the overall story is. Overall Im glad I read this to see what the hype was about, just wish there was more to it.	2002-09-10

The City In the Stars is one of the most entertaining sci fi books I have ever read. Clarke challenges your imagination through every step of this one. If there was a movie for every persons vision of this book, not a single one wold be the same. Clarke describes the unimaginable with such simplicity, yet you capture exactly what he is describing. A timeless classic!<BR>Sands of Mars is also very entertaining and is also a must read for any Clarke fan. Although there are many ideas that are false in this book (since we have now seen the surface of Mars) it is interesting to see what Clarke envisioned on this planet. There are great ideas in this novel.	2002-09-10

Neverwhere is an excellent adventure fantasy story and definetely brings the reader to another place. Gaiman touches on many genres and throws them into his works. He is a great story teller and he will only get better and better. I think I enjoyed American Gods a bit more but both are excellent stories which have turned me away from Bester and Clarke for a while.	2002-07-29

After reading alot about the Rising and past history, I was looking for something that tells of more recent accounts in the land. Rebel Hearts was it. The stories are excellent and left the way they happened. Toolis was not afraid to leave commentary run on. If that is how long an interview lasted then that is how it was written. I did not find this book bias either wich is always a plus for me. My only problem was getting lost in a few places. Seemed like a story would jump around from beginning to end back to beginning. Maybe this was just my error though.	2002-03-27

Unfortunately, this book seemed to be just a recap of the 2000 season. At times I felt I was reading old newspaper articles about the races. The very small amount of 'behind-the-scenes' stuff could have fit into 20 pages. If your a new fan or a fan of another driver this book will get you caught up with Tony's past seasons and should put the negative publicity to rest.
