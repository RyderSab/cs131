When she rescues a drowning man and makes headlines, she comes to the attention of Private Investigator Joel Kennedy who is seeking the lost daughter of a Greek tycoon who desperately need a bone marrow transplant.

In doing so, Grace became forever linked with Ireland's struggle for independence, because her husband was one of the signatories of the Proclamation of Independence.  So begins Marie O'Neill's biography of the woman who \\"became a powerful symbolic figure of the republican ideal for which her husband had given his life.\\"<br />Twenty-eight-year old Grace, the daughter of a Dublin solicitor, was second youngest in a family of twelve children.  Born into a prosperous home, Grace and her siblings were surrounded with comforts, a wide circle of friends, and educational opportunities.  Grace, a gifted artist, chose to study at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, then continued her studies in London, and finally returning to Dublin to begin a career as a caricaturist.  A chance meeting with an Irish journalist in London introduced grace and her sisters to a broadening circle of friends, including the poet and painter known as AE, William Butler Yeats, Constance Markievicz, and Maude Gonne.  The opening of St. Enda's brought them in contact with the future leaders of 1916.<br />Raised a Protestant, Grace's increasing interest in her father's faith also led to a deepening friendship with Joseph Plunkett, whom she met at St. Enda's in late 1914 or early 1915.  By winter 1915, the couple was secretly engaged and planned an Easter wedding following Grace's baptism into the Catholic faith.  Through the War of Independence and the Civil War, Grace barely made ends meet.  A lifelong Republican, Grace was never a member of Cumann na mBan, the women's auxiliary organization that worked to support the Volunteers.  Still, she was arrested and served time in Kilmainham Gaol, along with other Republican women.  After her release, Grace, who remained a widow for the rest of her life, struggled to make a living from her art.  Many times she was reduced to poverty, and life only became easier after Eamon deValera and his party came into power and she received a civil list pension.<br />Grace continued to draw, and her cartoons showed an incisive wit.  Quiet and moody, she remained in Dublin, working until her health began to fail.  She died in 1955, presumably from heart failure.  She was accorded a funeral with full military honors.<br />O'Neill's biography is a sensitive portrayal of a little known woman in a generation of extraordinary Irish men and women.  Her history is important so the world can remember Grace Gifford Plunkett, a quiet woman whose immense talent and charm make her more than simply the \\"tragic bride of 1916.\\"ing from her art.

Zuckerman chronicles just  four countries in his treatise about the spud, but these countries: France, England, Ireland, and the United States are, he says, representative of the Western world.<br />Despite the potato's vital nutrients, it soon became known as the food of the poor and remained out of favor among the gentry. Even the peasants did not appreciate the strange plant that formed odd tubers which sprouted, which they declared to be of the Devil.  But by the end of the seventeenth century, the potato as a staple food for Ireland's poor had become widely known.  At the same time in England, the potato had yet to become a table food.  Farmers fed them to their livestock.  Within a hundred years, the potato had \\"nosed its way into English life.\\"  In France, where the fear of nightshades was even greater than in England, the potato caught on because the wet summers did not affect this hardy plant as they did grain.<br />Zuckerman traces the tuber's history from its beginnings through the horrific Potato Famine of Ireland to farm staple in a post-Civil War U.S.  The potato represented a food whose ease of preparation lightened the burden for the average American farm wife.  In chapters titled Potatoes and Population, A Passion for Thrift, Women's Work, The Good Companions, and Good Breeding (showing the evolution of the tuber from exotic and fearsome to low class, to beneath notice), Zuckerman educates and entertains, and at the same time shows us that having read the history of the lowly spud, we can never regard it in the same way.  Perhaps the humble potato did rescue the Western world.	2002-09-21

Ms. Macdonald populates this suspenseful tale with several delightful secondary characters, and uses a deft hand to weave scenery and realistic dialogue into a beautifully crafted tapestry.  Macdonald skillfully uses the nuances of Irish English to avoid the stereotypical speech patterns often seen in other Irish-set books...	2002-08-11

His prose is as lyrical as his music, sprinkled with laughter and pathos.<br />I read, and understood his struggle living in a country of which he said had one foot in the twentieth century and the other in the Middle Ages.  From provincial Ireland to the fast pace of New York's Greenwich Village in an era of coffee houses, folk singers, booze and (Playboy) bunnies, the multi-talented Liam Clancy comes out a survivor, unapologetic and charming.<br />My only problem with this book is that it ended too soon.<br />Will we be treated to a sequel, Mr. Clancy?	2002-08-11

I predict Ms. Style is headed for a stellar career.	2002-07-12
