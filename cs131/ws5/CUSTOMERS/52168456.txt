I've had this set a long time without using it much but now I am finding it very helpful to work through it.<br /><br />Advantages include;<br /><br />1 - good, clear pronunciation, starting with single words or one or two word phrases in the early tracks, working up to sentences in later tracks.<br /><br />2- very usable track length, short enough to skip around effectively but also to restart a track for instant review - I play the track through once just listening (or repeating if I'm a little familiar with the material), then again responding, then leave it and come back the same day and find I have remembered most of it.<br /><br />3- methodical introduction of new material - any given phrase or sentence doesn't introduce more than one or two new words<br /><br />4- logical grouping of material in tracks, which makes the material easier to learn - tracks on topics like hotels, restaurants, or shopping, then other tracks on more abstract material like time or verbs.<br /><br />5- complete transcript in accompanying booklets<br /><br />Disadvantages:<br /><br />1- as other reviewers have noted, no conversation practice<br /><br />2- no written explanations of grammar - some may not want this but it is helpful to me<br /><br />3- no way to meaningfully practice reading or writing<br /><br />On the whole, an excellent buy for the price, but you will need some supplemental material to REALLY learn Spanish.	2005-09-06

The exercises are interesting, the tracks are usably short, and a continuing story line holds interest.  The accompanying book has not only complete transcripts but additional grammar explanations and a vocabulary index.<br /><br />But what a pity there is so little overall content!  It's geared to travel situations but there isn't a lot of vocabulary.  Furthermore, the Spanish is Castilian (the kind spoken in Spain, not Latin America), which limits its use.  The narrators have British English acdents which may pose a problem for some, though it didn't for me.<br /><br />If the course had about twice the vocabulary I'd rate it five stars.  As it is, I consider it a wonderful introduction to Spanish and quite easy to use in your car.	2005-08-31

And despite what other reviewers have said, there is no pause between phrases long enough to repeat them.  If you want pauses you have to use the CD controls to create them yourself.  I don't recommend this for use in the car.  As far as I can tell this is pretty much the content of one of Language Dynamics's other courses retitled for marketing rather than actually designed to be used in the car.<br /><br />The book's exercises are fairly good, but the printing, formatting, and packaging are all of low quality.  The set I received, for instance, had what looked like a black and white photocopy insert in the box sleeve.  There are mistakes in the book, always unsettling for a novice.  It makes me wonder if there are bad mistakes in the Spanish being taught as well.<br /><br />The best \\"in the car\\" course I've found is the old PDQ Spanish, which has a wonderful, engaging teaching style but has only a very limited vocabulary range, all geared to travel, and with British narrators and Castilian Spanish.  Behind the Wheel Spanish may be OK for armchair study with CD controls in hand, for those who don't mind the constant distraction of pausing every 5 seconds or so, but I have found it too clumsy to use.	2005-08-31

Audio Set (Musical Spanish) (English and Spanish Edition)	Books	2	4	7	N	Y	No vosotros forms, but better than nothing - maybe	I was terribly disappointed to find that the verb drills on these CDs do not include the informal 2d person plural vosotros,as used in Spain and, just as importantly, in much classic Spanish literature.  I see no point in learning some forms of each tense and mood of verbs and not all of them.  On the other hand, it is true that the vosotros form is almost never used in the Americas, so I suppose this is helpful material for those who want to learn Spanish only for use in, say, Mexico or Guatemala.  But why do that?  If you decide you want to anyway, this is pure drill material, and if you learn better by listening and speaking than by reading and speaking, this isn't a bad way to learn.  Just remember you are only learning part of the language, and you'll be lost in Spain or speaking to native Spaniards.	2005-08-18

Don't try that with this one; you will be wasting your time, and, perhaps, dangerously distracting yourself.<br /><br />I found this product very useful to work with as a concentrated activity:  sitting with the CD headphones on and the booklet in hand, reading as I listened and repeated.  I picked up some new words each time I did this, but I could only listen to one track at a time (each is about 20 minutes long) and I agree with the reviewer who said the tracks are too long and should have been broken up.<br /><br />Unfortunately repitition is indeed the key to vocabulary learning: listening, speaking, reading, and then more of the same.  Since this product only speaks each word once, in Spanish and English or in English and Spanish, then instantly moves on to another word, you are going to have to do much of the repetition on your own.  The booklets help with this, but you will still have to structure your own approach to repeating.<br /><br />Do not try to do this in your car!  Your job in your car is to drive, and this disc is so concentrated that the danger is you'll concentrate on it instead of the road.<br /><br />An adjunct to learning vocabulary, not the key.  But it does have a lot of words, all pronounced pretty clearly, and that is a certain help in itself.	2005-08-04

The songs are funny and easy to pick up, and the lessons then pounce on the words of the song and dissect things like tense, gender, subject/object, in an interesting and unconventional order - not too many Spanish courses introduce the future tense in the first lesson - but maybe they should, since it is fairly easy to learn.  I was quite pleased with the clear, succinct grammar explanations.  Though not exactly a video game, I found it entertaining to watch the animations.  The words of the songs have been re-written to convey some basic words and grammar concepts, so it's not for Latin music purists.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is a rapid survey, not an in-depth course.  You won't learn much vocabulary and you won't get to practice much .  Adobe Acrobat is kind of a pain to navigate unless you're used to it.<br /><br />I have not tried listening to the CD, though that is an option, only using it interactively on my computer.  I didn't expect high musical quality on my computer and can't speak to what it would sound like in an audio system.	2005-07-09

On the other hand, the full color illustrations are nice and there are a number of detailed maps, which unfortunately are not keyed to the numbered events in the text.  The item list in the back is nice to have but also incomplete and with some errors.<br /><br />Since you're probably going to have to buy it used at this point and pay way more than the original price (I did, anyway), think about whether you want this just for the not-totally-complete maps and item lists.  The text is juvenile and the plot line is incomplete, so don't buy it for that.  There are wonderfully detailed guides free for the downloading available on line, so if you wants hints and walkthroughs, get one of them, not this.	2005-03-02

You get the picture.  Brilliant idea, poorly educated, and, worst of all, unresolved at novel's end - you'll have to buy another book, and after that one more, to find out the resolution.  And I just CAN'T labor through any more florid descriptions.  So, reluctantly, I say:  don't buy it.	2004-08-31

Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible	Books	2	22	46	N	Y	Hard to use, can't install on hard drive	While the New Interpreter's Study Bible in hardcover is actually a pretty good study Bible, this CD-ROM version is a pain to use.  The interface is clunky, there is little documentation included with the software, and you can't install the whole program on your computer's hard drive - so every time you want to use it, you'll need to hunt up the CD and put it physically in your CD drive.  With only the New Revised Standard and King James versions to compare, you might as well face the fact that this is a one-version, very limited Bible study software.  Having the dictionary included is not much of an incentive.  If you want to do serious Bible study using your computer this is far too limited in scope, and if all you want is one version of the Bible it is actually much faster and easier to use a printed copy.  Overpriced, too, for the amount of content you actually get.  Try BibleWorks for the really ultimate Bible study software, which is more expensive and also takes some learning to use, but once you've learned to use it you have a truly powerful tool with dozens of Bible versions in English, the original languages, and many foreign languages, as well as multiple reference works integrated in the program.

He writes smoothly, with interesting and well-drawn characters and an intriguing plot.  Odd is a young man who sees dead people and communicates with them - sometimes about the circumstances of the their death, sometimes in less focused ways.  He also senses other creatures (\\"bodachs\\") whose presence is associated with violence.  Because of these awarenesses, he stumbles on the terrible possibility of an upcoming mass murder.  Though the plot drags a bit in places, most of it clips along in twists and turns that keep the reader's interest and attention.  I recommend it.	2004-08-07

One might argue with the selection of battles, but in every case Hanson presents a fascinating comparison between the cultures of the opposing forces.  I was very disappointed that the paperback copy I have is missing key captions from most of the maps, clearly misprinted - partial captions in some cases, blank spaces in others - which made the maps of limited usefulness.  Especially interesting is Hanson's rather pessimistic view of future wars - he does not share the commmon wisdom that Western democracies will not attack each other.  On the whole a well-written and thought provoking read, though you may not be convinced of his main idea.	2004-07-28

Though this appreciation of the Gospel of Thomas is interesting, it is murky in places and marred by her moving account of her personal tragedies which unfortunately she fails to relate clearly to the subject at hand.  I found her older book (much older, actually - 1979, I think) far more clearly written and much more logically organized.  The present work does incorporate some more recent scholarly work, and this edition includes the complete text of the Gospel of Thomas in English translation, which is quite helpful.  I recommend Pagels's The Gnostic Gospels over this one.	2004-07-21

There are interestingly detailed medieval battle scenes, but only a few.  The main character's dreary reliance on profanity wore on me.  But most disappointing was the utter lack of resolution in any of the plot lines at the end of the book.  If you weren't planning on buying further books in the series, don't bother with this one, because the story just hangs in mid-air at the end.  I would have preferred more candor about this - I'm not taken enough with the character or the writing to bother with more of this, so that truly made this partial tale a waste of time.  However, if the character intrigues you, or you want to read every alternate history book ever written, by all means go for it.	2004-06-21

It's set in the near future but depends heavily on an alternate 19th century in which the Northern Hemisphere has been devastated by a comet or asteroid strike and the dominant power in the world is now the British Empire transplanted to India.  Technology has developed more slowly, society has hardly developed at all, and geo-political intrigue swirls among Russia, Dai-Nippon, France-outre-Mer, and the Empire.  There are touches of speculation about parallel universes and alternate time strands, too.<br />The characters are based on familiar stereotypes but have been given their own individual quirks.  Though not complex, they are engaging and memeorable.  The book assumes a continuing racialism in the Empire that I didn't read as advocacy but a part of the plot line; however, some might find it disturbing.<br />The ingenious plot catches the reader up in the action and keeps the pages turning.  Some of it is predictable, but part of the pleasure of the book is its unique take on the action/adventure genre, which just IS predictable.<br />The author's meticulously detailed descriptions provide a vividly realized setting in a believable alternate India.  He has gone to some trouble to think out linguistic, social, religious, economic, and military implications of a destroyed Europe and relocated Western civilization - for those who get confused in the beginning  of the book, feel free to turn to the appendices to orient yourself, though I didn't read them until I finished.<br />A good read which I highly recommend - and yes, the title is a bit inaccurate, but nevertheless serves as a nice tag for the book's premise and plot.	2004-06-19

With its heavey reliance on the supernatural and the gory, this book definitely falls into the horror category.  But if you don't mind a little horror it's an entertaining tale, with several plot lines running simulataneously, some obvious, some less so.  Maybe the best part of the book is the chapter titles, which aren't displayed on the chapters themselves, only on the section pages - take the time to match them up with the chapters.  I like more complex characterization than this book provides, too, but the people you will meet in these pages do have being - they are more than just cardboard cutouts.  Decent, workmanlike prose, shrewd imaginative renderings of post-nuclear life, and good pacing are also pluses.  Fans of McCammon will probably really love the book, and for the rest of us, it's a diverting way to spend a few evenings.  But it's not one I'll come back to read again.	2004-05-25

Though superficially it could be classified as science fiction, this book defies genre.  Gorgeous prose, masterfully realized characters, mesmerizing plot, the deepest of themes.  I have given copies of this book to many friends, who usually give or recommend it to their friends.

It really does work to efficiently and quickly teach you the material.  Unfortunately, it teaches you so LITTLE material that you will be left with a vocabulary of around 50 words and a series of set phrases that won't get you far in any conversation where the Japanese speaker hasn't memorized the same responses.<br />Here's what it DOES WELL:<br />  1.  It teaches you Japanese pronunciation, intonation, and rudimentary sentance structure.<br />  2.  It does this in a way that truly cements the little you've learned in your memory.<br />  3.  It provides some very brief comments on Japanese customs and courtesies.<br />  4.  You will be able to greet people in Japanese and communicate that you do not speak the language well.  Though other material is covered, the limited vocabulary and set sentences will keep you from doing more than, say, observing that the weather is nice and nodding helplessly at the reply.<br />This 8 disk set is fairly reasonably priced on Amazon and is a good adjunct for a more comprehensive written text or the phrase book you intend to take on your trip (because it gives you pronunciation practice).  The more expensive &quot;full&quot; course only adds a few disks and, by the nature of the method, little vocabulary and no grammar.  I only wish this effective learning method included more material at a more reasonable price - I would rate it more highly in that case<br />Addendum:  Now that I have made a trip to Japan, I think less time spent on asking other people to drink or eat with you and more time spent talking to taxi drivers would have been more useful - phrases such as &quot;near..&quot; and &quot;stop here&quot; would have helped a lot.  Of course, this is not a &quot;Japanese for travelers&quot; course, and these lessons are but the beginning of a longer (and much more expensive) course in Japanese in general.	2004-05-08

However, the book is written in surprisingly poor English, with awkward syntax and some outright grammatical errors that should have been eliminated in the editing process.

This translation does more than I have ever managed to do to bring people into direct, immediate engagement with God through Scripture.  You will be amazed, appalled, amused, and overjoyed at what you read here, and you will ask:  is he making this up?  He's not. I was trained in Greek and Hebrew, and every time I read a passage and think to myself, &quot;OK, Peterson, you're around the bend now!&quot; and go stomping off to dig out my reference books and translate it myself, I have had to admit he did a wonderful job of capturing both the flavor and meaning of the original.  Admittedly, I haven't read it cover to cover (not the way to read the Bible anway) but I've read enough of both Testaments to know this is the best contemporary langauge translation out there.<br />This is not a &quot;word for word&quot; but a &quot;paraphrased&quot; translation - that is, it attempts to translate whole ideas rather than smaller units of meaning, and this puts it in the tradition of such recent translations as the New Jerusalem Bible or the Revised English Bible, rather than translations such as the New Revised Standard Version or the New International Version.  One real drawback of &quot;The Message&quot; is that it is a single scholar's translation and thus open to patterns of unconscious or conscious theological bias which are less likely in translations done in collaboration with others.  I suppose his biases match mine, because I haven't noticed them yet!<br />This is NOT the Bible to buy to the young person taking a college course in Bibilical studies - stick for one of the more traditional types of translation for them.  But if you want to read the Bible for your own enjoyment, enlightment, guidance, and spiritual growth, put your other Bibles away and read this one daily for a month.  You may never go back to your old translations again.	2003-03-01

The Gimmick series uses a technique of learning several synonyms/antonyms at once to increase vocabulary rapidly, and that is very helpful.  But two MAJOR cautions about this book:<br />1.  Some of the answers in the back and some of the definitions themselves are wrong.  Often the wrong person of the verb is given in the answers, and I have run across at least one completely incorrect verb definition.  Furthermore, when the author teaches vulgar terms (part of the gimmick) her English definitions often fail to capture the offensiveness of the Spanish words.<br />2.  The lack of a complete glossary and the author's habit of using words not yet introduced in the exercises make the translation drills tedious.<br />That said, this is an interesting review of Spanish basics for people who already know some Spanish.  Despite the author's claim in the introduction, it is difficult to use this book to learn Spanish from scratch all by yourself.	2002-07-13

There are short (often one paragraph) readings clustered by theme in various sections.  I recommend this for anyone interested in the themes of repentance and forgiveness, or for reading during Lent.	2001-01-17
US	52168456	RU5SFK0VYVNJG	0679451226	809423063	The Sibley Guide to Birds	Books	5	18	19	N	Y	Wonderful - get it!	Absolutely the best bird identification guide I have.  Worth every penny of the cover price.  It is not really too large for carrying into the woods though it is indeed larger than most field guids - and the precise, carefully described illustrations make it far more helpful than photographic guides, and even - I never thought I'd say this! - than Peterson's.  Buy this at once - every bird lover will love this book.	2001-01-13

I enjoyed &quot;The Alienist&quot; and was looking for something new to read - but this is an awful waste.  In penance I am donating the cover price to our local food pantry; you can do better by avoiding this book.	2001-01-13

This one is as bad as the rest:  wooden prose, implausible plot, unbelievable and unsympathetic characters.  Don't waste your money on  this one.	2000-02-01

Interesting tale of an American arctic pilot who gets entangled in a prewar Nazi Antarctic expedition with goes badly. No great brainwork involved but an entertaining story, despite moments of tediousness.	1999-02-17
