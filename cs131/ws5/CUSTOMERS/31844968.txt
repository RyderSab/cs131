As potential evidence for this, Ronner shows the amazing similarities between Abraham Lincoln, JFK & Ceasar; and then also between Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.<br /><br />Then Ronner discusses the great number of \\"end of days\\" prophecies - why there are so many, and potential reasons for why they've all been wrong to date.  Could it be that we're constantly changing our future, and that previous prophecies were merely one of the many potential outcomes for our planet?<br /><br />The scientific evidence for prophetic abilities, as well as information on various \\"prophets/seers\\" is then provided, along with various types of divination techniques.  The question of whether or not everyone has these abilities is then touched on.<br /><br />Last, Ronner shows the amazing power of the mind in creating our experiences/future.  This makes sense given the well-known evidence re: the \\"self fulfilling prophecy\\" - we get what we believe we will get...<br /><br />Overall, I found \\"Seeing Your Future\\" to be an interesting, easy read.  As such, I would highly recommend it to those interested in the \\"paranormal\\" in general, and prophecy/prediction in particular.	2005-10-13

In order to have such a dialogue, an electric shock was given to the \\"client\\" in order to dislodge the spirit, who was then allowed to \\"control\\" Mrs. Wickland for a certain period of time (she became like a surrogate body to these spirits).  Mr. Wicland then began a series of questions in an effort to determine who the spirit was, and why they were obsessing that particular patient - or for that matter, why they were obsessing at all...<br /><br />Also included in this book are hefty discussions on skepticism, religion & atheism - all generally interesting, but sometimes a bit wordy.<br /><br />The one thing I did not like about \\"The Gateway\\" was the author's tendency to put down other people's beliefs.  It appeared that if other's received info. that was counter to what he had received, then his view was that the other person's info. was given by an ignorant spirit, and so he was \\"right\\".  I found this amusing considering the fact that he dealt with what he called \\"ignorant spirits\\" on a daily basis - as these are the ones that tend to obsess - yet he felt that the info. he received, or what he surmised from this info., was somehow of a higher level than what anyone else could receive.<br /><br />The author also had a tendency to put down religion, and those who believe in religion - regardless of what that religion may be.  This tendency may offend some readers.<br /><br />Overall, I have given this book 4 stars because, even though I disagree with some of Wickland's conclusions, and the overall sense of his views are that his are superior, this book does provide a wealth of information for the spiritual student to ponder, and it's written in such a way that it's easy to understand & interesting.  Plus, there aren't many spiritual books out there of this length and comprehensivness where one could say that they agree with everything that was written - that's just par for the course...<br /><br />It's my belief that all books of a spiritual nature have something to offer - but it's like the blind trying to describe an elephant - your experience depends on where you're \\"standing\\" at the time & what you're feeling.  I don't believe that there is anyone who could describe ALL of the Divine & the afterlife that awaits us - that's part of the great mystery of life...superior, this book does provide a wealth of information for the spiritual student to ponder, and it's written in such a way that it's easy to understand & interesting.

I originally purchased this book because it is suggested reading for the school I am currently attending to become certified as a \\"Life Coach\\".  Since it's now \\"out of print\\", I had almost decided not to get it, but then thought better of it & chose to go ahead and buy a used copy - and I have to say that I am really glad that I did!<br /><br />\\"Take Charge\\" is literally jam packed with great insights on life in general.  The author starts off with stories of people who have actually changed some aspect of their life for which they were previously unhappy or stressed.  These changes were generally made possible by some insight that he either shared directly with his client, or helped his client reach through appropriate questioning.<br /><br />He then goes on to discuss the \\"big lie\\" - that other people are responsible for your feelings - and the negative impact this lie has on many of us.  He suggests that we need to realize that we are in control of our feelings, and by allowing other people's actions to impact how you feel will literally leave you powerless (as you cannot MAKE someone change, you can only change yourself and your choices).<br /><br />After this, he shares essays on various life situations and his current beliefs - always discussing how \\"negative\\" life events can be looked at in a different, more positive way (we coaches call this \\"re-framing\\").<br /><br />The last 3 chapters encompass his philosophy on life, \\"quick fixes for minor snags\\" & various affirmations - all of which provide a wealth of information to assist those of us in the \\"helping professions\\", as well as those who would like to change some part of their lives, but just don't know how.<br /><br />Overall, this is an easy, enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it (it's one of those books that's worth finding a used copy of if it continues to remain out-of-print)	2005-10-03

Shortly after this occured, this once normal little girl became completely retarded, and physically disabled.  It was a change that could not be explained by medicine - as the many doctors who saw her could not come up with a theory as to what was happening or why.<br /><br />As retardation set in, Karen was sent to a mental hospital, where she remained for many years.  Eventually, a fundamentalist preacher determined that she was possessed by demons, and a group of 10 people (including a doctor, psychologist, a couple of nurses, and several \\"men of the cloth\\") were brought together for this purpose.<br /><br />During the exorcism, it was found that Karen had 13 \\"demons\\" inside her, and all were expelled from her within a 3 day period.  This book describes in detail what occured during this period of time.<br /><br />Although, as I said before, this was quite interesting, I found myself questioning their thought processes several times.  For one, they seemed to be more than willing to believe in what a \\"demon\\" had to say if it agreed with their belief system - when it didn't, they simply decided they were being lied to.  Also, I've read several books where the \\"demons\\" are acutally persuaded to look within, and are actually helped to move into the light, instead of going back to the \\"darkness\\".  There were several times where these entities showed a possible willingness to receive help, yet none was given - even though the preacher said that he'd seen many of them before - so, obviously if they exist, they're just going to find another host - the goal should be to get them into the \\"light\\" in my opinion...<br /><br />Overall, I'm still not sure what I believe re: possession.  It's been on my mind for a while now, as I've read several books on the topic.  Although I am unwilling to say that it can't happen (who am I to debunk other's experiences), I'm just not certain that it does, or how prevelant it would be if it does happen.  I just can't get past the idea that we're supposed to have \\"free will\\", and if we can become possessed without our knowledge, that would go against that concept.  So, I'll have to continue to ponder my thoughts on this.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in the idea of possession, then I would highly recommend this book.  Just realize that it's written from a fundamentalist christian perspective.while now, as I've read several books on the topic.

This newer book, written 15 years later, includes all of the same info. from the first book, plus an extra chapter.  This last chapter discusses many things, such as:<br /><br />1.  The fact that the prison system is totally ineffective at allowing for appropriate treatment (something that I feel is absolutely necessary if we are ever to help these people learn to be able to function appropriately within society).<br /><br />2.  The fact that most psychologists are still unwilling to use unconventional methods to treat their patients - even though such methods have been shown to make an appreciable difference.<br /><br />3.  The politics involved within the Psychology profession.<br /><br />4.  What the doctor has come to believe about what he has seen and dealt with re: MPD patients - ultimately his new-found spiritual outlook.<br /><br />The first 9 chapters discuss Dr. Allison's experiences with several of his MPD patients.  They provide a look into the potential causes for this disorder, and the amazing methods he was \\"forced\\" to use in an effort to help his patients.  Please read my review of this author's first book for a more in-depth look into these chapters.<br /><br />Overall, if you are at all interested in psychology &/or the potential for spirit possession, then I highly recommend this book!	2005-09-08

After reading these reviews, I studied the cover once again, trying to find where it states that any proof will be given - yet, there's no such statement ANYWHERE!  What it states is that they will provide \\"compelling evidence\\" - and in my opinion they have achieved this goal.<br /><br />\\"Old Souls\\" discusses some of those cases suggestive of reincarnation that Dr. Ian Stephenson had investigated during his career.  These cases are found all over the world, but this book tends to discuss only those found in Lebanon, India, and a few in the US.  Much of the info. provided tends to be clinical in a sense, but one has to remember that Dr. Stephenson is trying to pursue this from a scientific point of view - in an effort to bring this sort of research into the mainstream.<br /><br />The author, Thomas Shroder, is a journalist skeptic who followed Dr. Stephenson on the last few of his journeys.  I must say that it's hard at times to read how the skeptics view the evidence, as it seems to show without a doubt the saying that believers don't need extraordinary proof, but to the skeptic, no proof is good enough.  However, by the end, this skeptic was at least left wondering - not willing to deny everything he saw and heard - at least thats a start...<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality in general, and more specifically reincarnation.  It provides an excellent view into the research, and how & why the skeptics tend to rip it apart.	2005-09-05

He also shines a light on how difficult it is for a professional psychiatrist to use unorthodox means as a way of curing those in pain - even when those methods have proven to be amazingly successful.<br /><br />While reading this book, one can't help but ponder how much we still don't know about the mind.  Quite frankly, it's scarey to realize just how little knowledge we've gained to date.  However, I believe, as does the author, that we can learn much about both the health & illnesses of this \\"organ\\" through the research of MPD patients.<br /><br />There are a few instances where Dr. Allison had to use such unorthodox means as exorcism to rid the patient of harmful personalities - it seems as though some personalities were  constructed by the patient for specific purposes, whereas others may actually be the spirits of deceased persons who somehow became attached to the patient so that they can continue to \\"live\\" on earth.  Even though the dr. does perform these tasks when necessary, he wasn't sure that it was truly spirit possession that he was encountering - but whatever the issue was, it did respond quite quickly to the process of exorcism.<br /><br />It seems as if the patients who receive the best treatment have doctors who are willing to keep an open mind, and treat each instance (even if they don't believe what is happening, or aren't sure) as if it was REAL - as opposed to fighting with the patient, trying to tell them that it's all a figment of their imagination.  It's high time that more psychiatrists & psychologists realize this...<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology/psychiatry in general, and MPD in particular, as well as those who have an interest in possible spirit possession.articular, as well as those who have an interest in possible spirit possession.	2005-09-03

I tended to read it a bit at a time because, although interesting, it was quite hard to get through.  The main reason for this, I think, is that it's filled to the brim with physics-related information - and I have little to no physics background with which to understand these concepts.  It's because I believe that many others would be stumped by this information as well, that I have rated \\"The Prophet & the Astronomer\\" a 3.<br /><br />Beyond the complicated physics theories, I found this book to provide quite an interesting look at cosmology through the ages.  The author discusses how several hundred years ago, most people believed that such things as comets & shooting stars were actually meant to warn them of bad things to come - famine, war, death, etc...  This is how cosmology began to influence, and be influenced by, theology/religion.<br /><br />He then goes on to show how many cults of past & present still use this type of information to scare their followers into continued cult association, and how they also use such things as comets & shooting stars to then explain away why their predictions didn't come about as they said it would - for ex., they might say that they just saw a shooting star, and this means that God has changed his timing...<br /><br />It's also shown how each culture tends to believe that the end of the world will occur in their lifetime - people have been preparing for this for thousands of years...<br /><br />One can see through the progression of this book how some people today still believe much the same things as those in times past re: cosmology & the end.  However, now more than ever, science has been at the forefront of this exciting field, as opposed to religion.  However, the author believes that science & religion don't have to be on opposite sides of the fence on this issue - as both are essentially trying to answer the same questions.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to those who have an interest & background in physics in general, and cosmology in particular.  I think you will find it an interesting read.the same questions. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book to those who have an interest & background in physics in general, and cosmology in particular.

However, if we find ourselves in a place that we don't want to be, we can change it - we're not stuck for all eternity in any one place - but it's up to us to see where we went wrong, and change our thoughts/beliefs & actions (I've read about this insight in many different books, and it really points to the idea that our thoughts/beliefs are just as important as our actions...).<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in spirituality in general, and after-death communications in particular.  Although Amazon.com does not currently carry this book, it's well worth purchasing a used copy - it's that good!	2005-09-01

Instead, this book is about the writer's journey from full-fledged skeptic to someone who at least wonders \\"what if...\\", and the cast of \\"regulars\\" in this town.<br /><br />Lily Dale is a spiritualist community/summer camp that has been running since the 1800's.  Once summer hits, this town is filled to the brim with those looking for help, answers, and some rest & relaxation.  There are generally around 30 mediums/psychics/healers open for business during this busy time, and they hold many different classes having to do with various spiritual topics.<br /><br />Althoug much of \\"Lily Dale\\" deals with the author's own transformation, several interesting stories re: the help received through various medium's messages are included.  It is also shown that even the best psychics/mediums aren't right all the time - but then again, one really needs to question who is?

I read this book in high school - nearly 20 years ago now - and I have yet to forget the storyline.  In fact, although written in a language of a different time, we can find some of the same types of actions happening today - albeit in a more subtle manner.<br /><br />Overall, this is the story of a young woman who committed adultery, and is caught because she becomes pregnant at a time when abortion was not an option.  Although many other people in her puritan community have committed the same \\"transgression\\", they haven't been caught yet (i.e. haven't become pregnant), so they participate in ruining this woman's reputation by forcing her to wear a scarlet \\"A\\", to symbolize her adulterous nature.<br /><br />I believe that in our society, people tend to do the same thing - they participate in gossip/making fun of people who have been unlucky enough to be caught doing the same thing many other's are doing day in and day out.  For this reason, I feel as though this story is as relevant today as it was when it was written.<br /><br />I do have to agree that the writing is a bit difficult to get through, as the language is quite different than what we are now used to.  But, if you have the time and patience to work through it, I think you will find it to be quite an eye-opener.	2005-08-30

The idea being that various personas show themselves in response to different situations - this is shown as being \\"normal\\".<br /><br />  But there is also another side to the multiplicity of man that is decidedly \\"abnormal\\" - such as with those who suffer from \\"multiple personality disorder\\", and those who feel as if they're being influenced from within by an outside source.  In these situations, where a person is being negatively influenced by \\"other personalities\\", the author looks at the situation through both scientific/psychological & \\"occult\\" theories.<br /><br />  1 of the \\"occult\\" theories is that of possession - that people can become possessed by the dead, living family members & thought-forms (of both a good & bad nature).  Mr. Crabtree included several examples where this appears to be the case, and shows that when the therapist treats each \\"personality\\" or \\"entity\\" as though it's real - regardless of whether they &/or the client actually believe them to be real - much can be accomplished by way of ridding the client of whatever negativity has been occuring.  The author also describes in detail how he has learned to deal with these situations, and what other therapists can expect if they choose to adopt his methods.<br /><br />Overall, I found the concepts discussed to be quite intriguing, and my interest was maintained throughout the reading.

The beginning was a bit slow going - I wasn't grabbed into the story until about half-way through - but the storyline was quite good, and the characters were well described.<br /><br />\\"Forty Words For Sorrow\\" is about a series of murders occuring in the Algonquin area - a VERY cold, snowy place, especially in winter - the time the murders were being committed.<br /><br />The perpetrators are actually a young couple, but they have a thirst for killing that seems insatiable, and an ability to project the type of personality that other's like & feel comfortable with - hence there ability to get victims.<br /><br />Some parts of the story are quite gorey, and there were actually times where I felt sick to my stomach by the details provided - maybe it's my weak stomach, or maybe over-kill, I just don't know.<br /><br />They mystery to the story is whether or not the \\"bad guys\\" will be caught in time to save a life - whether or not the police can put together the small number of clues that have been left behind.  There is also another smaller mystery surrounding a pay-off taken by someone on the squad.  Although this part has nothing to do with the murders, it makes sense in the context of the story - I don't want to reveal anything more about this, as I don't want to ruin it for you.<br /><br />If you like a good mystery, and don't mind trudging through part of the book to get to the exciting parts, than I would recommend this book to you.  It's a good mystery with a great storyline & characters, you just have to have the patience to get there.	2005-08-25

She went on this vacation by herself, in order to take time to relax & reflect.  During this time, she noticed that each type of shell that she picked up had a \\"gift\\" - a way of looking at life that helped her to understand herself & other's better.<br /><br />She discusses the various periods in life that we all (or at least most) tend to go through, and what can be learned by each.  One of the most important of which is to learn who YOU are.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to any woman who feels overworked &/or underappreciated in any area of their life - you may find a better understanding to your issues throughout these pages...	2005-08-24

I just finished reading this book, and I am completely blown away!<br /><br />\\"The Minds of Billy Milligan\\" is about a young man with multiple personality disorder, the crimes a few of his personalities committed, and the mostly horrendous treatment he endured while trying to find help for his mental disability.<br /><br />One of the crimes committed was that of rape, the other was stealing.  Although I must admit that the crime of rape is horrific, it seems as if neither the court, politicians, nor the media cared about the reasons it happened.  All that was focused on was punishment, at the expense of trying to help this man get better, and to learn to be a functioning person is society.  It is really quite sad!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think that if the same thing happened today, the results would be similar.  We, as a society, are so worried about making sure that everyone receives their just punishment, that we don't stop to see if there is a reason for the disconnect - a reason for why people in our society do these things.  Maybe if we would focus our attention on the \\"whys\\", and how to provide EFFECTIVE treatment, we would find ourselves in a much better place.<br /><br />Overall, I found this book to be both sad & thought provoking.  I found myself getting angry at the reporters who sought to bring him down every time he was starting to show progress, as well as toward the politicians who used him as a bargaining chip to gain more votes - quite unhonestly, I found this to be disgusting behavior as well!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone intersted in psychology - specifically multiple personality disorder - it is a real eye opener!	2005-08-23

I just finished reading \\"Healing Lost Souls\\", and I must say that I'm not really sure how I feel about this subject.  The ideas it contains are quite new to me, and I will need to take some time to digest them...<br /><br />In this book, the author discusses his findings (as well as the findings of other professionals) that people on earth can be impacted by the attachment of earthbound souls, \\"dark force entities\\" &/or extraterrestrials (ET's).  The idea being that when there is a weakness in our auras, it's easy for these non-physical entities to enter into our physical being, and impact our lives in quite significant ways.<br /><br />The author also describes his way of helping these entities move on - a therapy called SRT - where the experience is treated as real (no matter how off the wall it sounds), and the entity is spoken to in a calm, nice but firm way, where it's explained that they are disturbing this persons life & need to move into the light.<br /><br />Other topics such as past life regression therapy & the history of exorcisms is also included.<br /><br />Examples are included throughout where the conversations between therapist & non-physical entity are noted, and the change in that persons life after such sessions are completed is discussed.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to those who are interested in the paranormal, as well as to therapists who are unsure how to proceed with certain patients - as 1 or more of the therapies discussed here may be of help.  One word of caution though, and open mind is a must!	2005-08-21

Although I tend to read mostly non-fiction, I've always liked a good mystery - and this was definately one of the best I've ever read!<br /><br />I have to start out by saying that this book ultimately deals with religion - christianity to be exact.  As a result, this particular mystery may not be right for everyone.<br /><br />Ghostwriter is about an editor who starts receiving pieces of a manuscript that detail his life - both past & present.  It includes things that no one he knows would have any knowledge of, and because it includes some things that he's not very proud of, it begins to scare the daylights out of him.  Who's writing this & why?  Do they intend to kill him &/or his family?<br /><br />This book has more twists & turns than you could ever imagine. I was riveted to my seat from beginning to end.  In fact, I read all of the nearly 400 pages of this book in a little over a day - I just could not put it down!!!<br /><br />I would highly recommend Ghostwriter to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.  It has a great plot, and the writer has done an excellent job with character development.  Plus, the twists and turns throughout will keep you turning pages all night!!!	2005-08-19

I actually read this book a few years ago, but have never forgotten it - it's one of those books that can have a real impact on you!<br /><br />\\"Lovely Bones\\" is about a young teenage girl who was brutally raped & murdered while walking home one day.  It's written from her standpoint - in \\"her Heaven\\" - where she can see the lives of everyone who impacted her unfolding before her eyes.<br /><br />Although one may expect her to be angry for losing her life so young, she displays more of a sadness re: life experiences that she will never get to have - like graduations, weddings, having children, etc...<br /><br />Of course her family is falling apart as the result of the tragedy.  They, each in their own way, have a need to have this killer caught - they need closure.<br /><br />So, will the killer ever be found?  Will he pay for his crimes?  Will the victim help lead the police right to him?  I won't answer these questions because I don't want to ruin it for you.  Suffice it to say that it's an excellent book, and a real page turner.<br /><br />If you like a good mystery, than this books for you!	2005-08-19

The only downfall was that the author tends to jump around quite a bit, and so the ideas seemed a bit \\"scattered\\" to me.  However, even with this \\"downfall\\", I think it's definitely a worthwhile read.<br /><br />This book covers many diverse ideas & experiences, but the main theme is that many people who die don't have a clue as to what has happened to them because our society does not make an effort to teach us what to expect - and, since we are still \\"alive\\" after death, and appear to still have a body, many people don't realize that they've transitioned to the \\"Other Side\\".  The idea is that this is the cause for earth-bound spirits or ghosts.<br /><br />The author also discusses in depth the theory re: \\"hitchhikers\\" - the idea that those entites who don't move on after death tend to \\"reside\\" in the bodies of loved ones, those addicted to the same substances, and really anyone who had lost conciousness during the same time period that the deceased left their own body.  I'm not sure what I believe re: this, but it's an intriguing theory.<br /><br />So, how do we get rid of these unwanted visitors?  A form of spirit counseling is described where someone explains to the spirit that they are dead, and that it's time to move on.  A counseling \\"template\\" is provided.<br /><br />Overall, this book kept my interest, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in the \\"paranormal\\".	2005-08-16

I had to purchase it \\"used\\" as Amazon.com is not, at least at this time, selling any new copies.<br /><br />Although this pamphlet is quite small, it contains a lot of great information on various techniques for contacting those on the \\"Other Side\\".  It includes info. on: table rapping, automatic writing, ouija board, and the 6th senses.<br /><br />It describes how to conduct these techniques, as well as what you can expect to occur.  For instance, during table tapping circles, one may actually see materializations &/or the feeling of being touched by an unseen (or sometimes seen) hand.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this \\"book\\" to anyone interested in spirit communication.

Although, before reading such books, I believe it's important for people to realize that the type of information that comes through will be dependent on \\"where\\" that entity is at the time of the communication.  As I've said before, I view it like the blind describing an elephant, where each person believes that what they are feeling/\\"seeing\\" is all there is.  With this is mind, each of the books I've read to date has provided me with a piece of the puzzle - this book included.<br /><br />In \\"Beyond the Horizon\\", the author describes the information that came through her from her good friend who had passed on unexpectedly in his sleep.  She also discusses for initial skepticism, and what it took to make her realize that these communications were genuine.<br /><br />The info. discussed was received through the technique of automatic writing - where the spirit entity actually writes to the receiver through pen & paper - with receiver holding the pen.  The author describes this technique, and how it worked for them.<br /><br />So what information was disclosed to the author?  Much was about daily living on the \\"Other Side\\", and the need for those on the earth plane to realize that where they end up after \\"death\\" has everything to do with how they lived their lives on earth, as well as their thoughts/intentions.  What happens to those who've lead horrendous lives is also described, as well as the help available to them when they are ready to take responsibility and move on.  Also discussed was how various scientific findings would eventually lead us on earth to realize that there really is no such thing as death - that we just transition to another form of life.<br /><br />This particular book has a christian flare to it, and I believe this is so because both the writier & receiver were practicing christians - so again, it may be that the spirit entity went to that place on the \\"Other Side\\" that fit with his current belief systems.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very interesting book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in spirituality &/or the \\"paranormal\\".  A word of caution though, an open mind is a must!again, it may be that the spirit entity went to that place on the \\"Other Side\\" that fit with his current belief systems. <br /> <br />Overall, I found this to be a very interesting book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in spirituality &/or the \\"paranormal\\".

The harm that the current seperatist philosophy has caused is also discussed - The idea being that we need to realize that we are all connected in some way, and what we do & say really does have an impact on the world at large.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book for anyone on a spiritual journey, as well as those who are wondering what being \\"spiritual\\" is all about.	2005-08-13

I found myself nodding as I read many of her examples, as I am either going through that right now, or have gone through it at some point in my life - I just never understood my experiences for what they truly were/are - lessons, and a chance to gain wisdom.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels \\"stuck\\" or \\"depressed\\" - even if you're not sure why you feel that way.  I also recommend it to those who are on a \\"spiritual journey\\", as it will likely add to your understanding of human nature and the Divine.<br /><br />There is one thing that is NECESSARY for you to bring to the reading of this book, and that is an open mind.

It reminds us that we are co-creators of our life situations, and therefore WE are the only ones who can make a difference in what & how we live.<br /><br />Each insight is only 1 or 2 sentences long, but is profound in its meaning.

After reading \\"Spirit Song\\" last week, I was quite excited to find out about this book written by the same author - in fact, I ordered it as soon as I became aware of its existence, and since it's no longer in print, I even chose to purchase a used copy (something I don't like to do too often).<br /><br />I received the book today, and anxiously began reading it.  However, within the first chapter, I was already beginning to feel a tinge of disappointment.<br /><br />\\"The Visitation\\" is about Mary Summer Rain's visit from an archangel \\"of the Most High\\", and the info./warning that was received.  It mainly focuses on the 10 commandments, and how man has distorted their meaning - not taking the time to really THINK about what they were meant to impart.<br /><br />The parts I was disappointed with are:<br /><br />1. Summer seems to continually look down on the people of today - as if all, or most, couldn't care less about God.  I don't agree with this, as I believe that people DO care, but many think it's wrong to think for themselves, to choose their own belief systems.  They've been taught from early on that to question is to sin.<br /><br />2.  Summer seemed to insinuate that the books written by the other \\"messengers\\" of our time are inaccurate & filled with \\"glitz\\".  It sounded as if, when someone receives a message that differs from hers, than that person must be writing from their ego, and therefore, it's not truth.<br /><br />My belief is that God has brought many different messages to many different people - not everyone is on the same page, so not everyone would be ready for the same message.  My thought is that you'll know the truthfulness of the message by the \\"fruit that it bears\\" - so, if it's  message of unconditional love &/or other positive \\"traits\\", then it's worth considering & pondering over.<br /><br />3.  Mary Summer Rain eludes continuously to major problems in her family life that preceeded this visit, but she never goes into any detail.  I kept waiting to get an understanding of these problems, since she would bring them up in a very general manner often - but it was never to be.  I would have preferred her to either not mention it at all, or just make a very general statement in the beginning & then just let it go.  I can understand that she may not want to lay bare her soul to her readers - but, if that's the case, it would have been better to just not mention it at all.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book does contain some important insights, but they tend to get clouded by the negative judgements that appear all too often.  So, although I REALLY hate to do it, I feel that I have to give this book a \\"3\\" rating - I just wouldn't feel comfortable giving it any more or less.ince she would bring them up in a very general manner often - but it was never to be.

I just finished reading \\"All You Need is Love\\", and I am still completely blown away by both the premise, and the amazing amount of proof the author uncovered!<br /><br />I must confess that, although I truly believe in past lives, and I consider myself to be pretty open minded, I still approached this particular book with a certain level of skepticism.  It's funny how, as soon as someone mentions a connection to someone famous, many of us are quick to decide that it must be fantasy - but when we read the same type of info about a connection to a regular \\"old joe\\", it's much easier to believe.  However, I now realize that because of this skepticism, it was probably even harder for the author to come forward with her story - who would take her seriously?  Who would believe her?  Yet, after reading this book cover to cover, I think it's more relevant to ask who couldn't believe her?  With the amount of evidence she's uncovered, you'd have to be pretty closed minded to chalk it all up to coincidence!<br /><br />This is actually several stories wrapped up into one.  The main premise is about a young mother who, after the shooting death of John Lennon, is overcome with a grief that she can't understand.  In trying to understand this intense emotion - for someone she never knew, and wasn't a major fan of - she uncovers evidence of having lived a tomultuous past live with Lennon - then John Baron.  However, even she is quite skeptical, and is unable to believe that this is really true.<br /><br />This story is about her journey... a very spiritual journey.  A journey which leads to her realization that she keeps living the same type of life over & over again - and will continue to do so until she heals herself. So, a part of this book is also about her current life, and by the end, one can easily see the parallels between the two.<br /><br />This is also a story about synchronicities - those amazing \\"coincidences\\" that tend to occur so many times that it's hard to just dismiss.  \\"All You Need is Love\\" is filled with so many of these amazing occurances that it becomes impossible to dismiss them with the wave of a hand.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a beautiful love story that offers the reader a chance to live vicariously through the \\"characters\\".  It also offers the reader a chance to learn about the topic of past lives, in an easy & riveting manner.  This is definitely a page turner!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic of past lives - it's really a great read!!!s hard to just dismiss.  \\"All You Need is Love\\" is filled with so many of these amazing occurances that it becomes impossible to dismiss them with the wave of a hand. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this is a beautiful love story that offers the reader a chance to live vicariously through the \\"characters\\".

I just finished reading this wonderful book, and I am still awed by its' beauty!  \\"Spirit Song\\" is truly a gem to behold!<br /><br />Mary Summer Rain's writing style is such that I actually felt as though I was right there with her & the \\"old woman\\" - hearing, seeing, smelling, feeling, & sensing all that they did.  What a wonderful journey it was!<br /><br />\\"Spirit Song\\" is a story about the author's meeting, and subsequent learning from, and old Chippewa visionary.  It is filled with the most beautiful imagery of the Colorado mountains - where both resided - as well as the amazing imagery of the past & potential future of life on earth.<br /><br />It's about an old woman with much to teach, and a younger woman who is eager to learn.  It's about that special bond we all need - friendship.  It's about hardship & loss, and bliss & freedom.  This book is so many things all wrapped up in a wonderfully written package.<br /><br />This is the first book in the No-Eyes series - apparently there are several - and I am quite eager now to order & read the next one.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in spirituality and/or the American Indian culture, this would be a great book for you.  I can't recommend it highly enough!  I would also recommend the book \\"Black Elk\\", which is another great portrayal of the life of an old Indian visionary.	2005-07-03

If you're interested in all of the unexplained phenomena in the world, than this book would be a great place to start.  It includes short (usual less than 1 page) pieces on virtually everything you could think of.  Then, if you find your interest piqued, you could research the subject further with other books on the topic.<br /><br />Overall, I found this book to be an easy, thought provoking & fun book to read.  And, even though it is now out of print, it's worth looking for.	2005-07-02

I just finished reading this book, and I am already thinking of all the amazing & wonderful things I can accomplish, and the sheer joy I can experience in my life, by co-creating the life I truly want to live with the help of Spirit.<br /><br />This amazing little book explains that we are co-creators of our own life experience, and that, when we request the help of Spirit, we will be given all the help we need to create exactly what we desire.<br /><br />The author has done a great job of explaining our role as creators, and of providing a context through which we can request aid from those in spirit - by actually creating comittees to help us achieve what is truly important to us.<br /><br />It's a great concept, and appears quite easy to use.  In fact, I can't wait to get started in creating the comittees I'd like to help me along the way.<br /><br />This is a relatively short book, but it's jam packed with great information & ideas.  So, although it can be read in one sitting, its' impact can last a life-time.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in the topic of creating the life you desire, then this is the book for you!  I would also highly recommend (as does the author) those books/tapes by Esther & Jerry Hicks, as well as the book \\"The Power of Intention\\" by Dr. Wayne Dyer.  Although they approach this topic in a different way, the core ideas are the same.	2005-07-01

This is the amazing story of \\"The Paradoxical Commandments\\", first written by Kent Keith back in college (I just have to say that I admire the soul & mind who could understand such a concept at that young age!!!).<br /><br />Well, these commandments wound up having a life of their own, and many years later, the author found out that his poem had actually been hung on a wall, on the other side of the earth, by none other than Mother Theresa.  However, although this poem was being read by people all over the world, no one knew that Mr. Keith was the author - he found that it had been considered anonymous.<br /><br />There is much more to this story, but I don't want to ruin it for you - suffice it to say that it's a wonderful, insightful book!  I also loved that included within the book is the poem on a frameable card - so you can hang it on your own wall, or keep it with you in your purse.  I can't think of any better reminder in these stressful days that regardless of what anyone does, says, thinks, etc... we need to learn to LOVE THEM ANYWAY!	2005-06-29

Over the last few years I have read many, many books on the subject of afterlife communications.  This, however, is the only book I've come across that deals specifically with souls who have taken their own lives.<br /><br />The insights provided from these souls is truly amazing!  They answer many questions such as why they chose to commit suicide, what would have helped them to choose life instead of death, as well as what they've learned since \\"crossing over\\" re: life in general, and the impact of suicide.<br /><br />This book is not only meant for those who've lost loved ones to suicide, and those who've attempted to take their own life, but it's meant for EVERYONE - EVERY SOUL - on this earth.  Through the reading of this book, one can learn much about how to LIVE -and to do so happily and filled with excitement.	2005-06-29

I've had this book sitting on my shelf for a couple of months now - not sure why I had ordered it, I let it just sit there - reading many, many others books in the meantime.  Then, for some reason, I went to the shelf to choose a new book to read tonight(as opposed to picking one up in the pile of new books right next to me), and I don't know why, but this is the book I chose.  I can't even convey right now how happy I am that I decided to read this book now!<br /><br />In \\"If God Was Like Man\\", Barbara Rose has provided the information she gleened from her experiences with the Divine - during which a good deal of extremely pertinant information was given.  Included are discussions on all of the major issues of today - from sex to people's rights to the need for self-love.  At the end of each, it's stated what God would like to see - which is always those things that will bring us joy instead of sadness.<br /><br />The 10 commandments are also discussed - are they real?  How were they meant to be understood?  How have we misunderstood?  This is all covered.<br /><br />The power of our thoughts and intentions is also discussed - as I read in another great book (\\"As A Man Thinketh\\") \\"As A man thinketh, so he is\\"...<br /><br />If you ever find yourself asking \\"why do we have to experience pain and loss?\\", you'll find this answer as well in this amazing book.  Also, if you've wondered just how we can make things better for our children, our loved ones, ourselves, there are many, many great suggestions included in this work.<br /><br />If you're wondering how an average woman can hear the words of God, then you must ask yourself how the prophets of old did - they weren't considered any more special than the next guy, and yet God's words were brought through them.  Why would God stop now???<br /><br />This is such a profound and important book, that I would highly recommend it to everyone.  Although I must note, an open mind is a must!<br /><br />If you enjoyed, or are interested in this book, I'd like to recommend 2 other life changing books - \\"The Power of Intention\\" by Dr. Wayne Dyer, and \\"What God Wants\\" by Neale Donald Walsch.  These 2 books are also profound, & provide the reader with information to help them learn & grow.e changing books - \\"The Power of Intention\\" by Dr. Wayne Dyer, and \\"What God Wants\\" by Neale Donald Walsch.

I've read many, many books on the topic of life after death - some were about NDE's, other's after-death communications, and still more from psychics who report what they've \\"seen\\" & \\"heard\\" from those on the other side.  Quite honestly, I find nearly all of them interesting!  I believe that each of these books has something wonderful to impart - though none of them have the full story - and that is how I approach each reading re: the afterlife.<br /><br />\\"The Afterlife Codes\\" is mostly autobiographical in nature - describing Susy Smith's life, as well as her ongoing research into the topic of life after death.  The other part of this book deals specifically with her hope to prove that there is life after death through a series of codes.  She has created certain codes (of which no one has any idea of what they contain).  Her idea being that, once she has \\"died\\", she will attempt to relate these codes to various psychics - and when the code has been broken, it will prove that our souls do not die with our bodies.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject of life after death.  A note of caution, however, this must be approaced with an open mind.	2005-06-24

I just got done reading \\"The Greatest Miracle in the World\\", and I feel speechless - not sure I can convey the beauty & wonder of this story.  Because of this, I will just say that this is an amazing little book - and I highly recommend it to EVERYONE!!!<br /><br />What is it about?  Well, it's about many things, but the most important point I guess is that we've all forgotten just how special we are - we've begun to just settle, believing that we can't create, or don't deserve, a better life.  But through this amazing story, we can all begin to see that we can have a wonderful life, and that we do, in fact, deserve it!<br /><br />At the end, you will find a message that can help you begin your journey to a better, more fulfilling life - it includes just 4 points to remember & ponder.  Although I don't want to \\"spill the beans\\" re: what they are, suffice it to say that they will help you to open your eyes & realize just how special YOU really are, as well as all you have to offer.<br /><br />I only wish everyone could read this book - how different our world might become...	2005-06-24

After reading both, I must say that the subject matter is absolutely fascinating, and the style of writing used has made these books both easy and thoroughly enjoyable to read.<br /><br />\\"Medicinemaker\\" is the continuation of a true story re: a series of visions the author experienced, where he actually meets himself 5,000 into the future.  Once again, the author takes you on a journey with him - a journey into his amazing, vivid visions - and, just as he actually experienced parts of the life he is living 5,000 from now, you feel like you're experiencing this with him.  He does such a wonderful job of pulling the reader in - there were actually times when I could really \\"see\\", \\"feel\\" & \\"hear\\" right along with him - what an exiting reading experience it was!<br /><br />You may think that since the visions were about human society 5,000 years in the future, that this book will be filled with amazing technology - like the Jetson's - but you'll be surprised to find out that all technology had been wiped out, and the people living at that time were living \\"off the land\\" - like our ancestors did many, many years ago.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a real \\"page turner\\", and enjoy books on various metaphysical phenomena, then this book's definitely for you!

And, like all books out there re: the afterlife, you just have to remember that it's like \\"the blind describing an elephant\\" - their experiences will depend, to some extent on \\"where they are\\", and their own thought processes (since I've learned over & over again that our thoughts have a major impact on what we experience both here & on the \\"Other Side\\").<br /><br />In \\"After the Light\\", Kimberly Clark Sharp describes her NDE - which occured at the young age of 22 - and the subsequent paranormal activity that has surrounded her since then.  One type of activity that became rather prevalent was her ability to see, and be affected by \\"demons\\" - or spirits that were definately not around to help her in any way.<br /><br />Although she has gone through some really scarey experiences since her NDE, she always comes to realize that their are greater forces of good surrounding her, protecting her when she needs them most.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read where the NDE'r has experienced this type of phenomena, and I found it quite interesting (although I must say that I would not want to be her when these things are happening!).<br /><br />In this book, Kimberly does an excellent job of writing in a conversational-type style - you feel as if she's right there chatting with you, sharing her most amazing story over a cup of coffee.  \\"After the Light\\" is both easy to read & a page turner - in fact I read this book in just one night because I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in NDEs in particular, and spirituality in general - it's an excellent read!	2005-06-23

I read \\"The Scole Experiment\\" a few months ago, and I absolutely loved it!<br /><br />This is a book about the psychical journey taken by 5 inexperienced (at least at first) investigators of the paranormal.  During a period of several years (I believe it was about 7), these people held \\"seances\\" in a farmhouse in Scole, and what they experienced was truly extraordinary!<br /><br />Although it's quite easy to brush off such experiences as \\"just made up\\", this group actually invited skeptics and believers alike to witness what was happening - & they all stated that it could not be explained away, it was REAL.<br /><br />What did they experience?  Well, there were several apports of amazingly old & beautiful items, the brushing of hands, voices on tape recorders, and pictures on video.<br /><br />I must say that this group did an amazing job of ensuring that safegaurds were put in place so that no one could accuse them of tampering with \\"the evidence\\" - they actually went overboard (in my opinion), but I can understand the need for this since many skeptics out there are ready to pouce on anything they can in an effort to \\"prove\\" trickery.<br /><br />Overall, if you are interested in metaphysical phenomena, and the research being done in this area, this would be an excellent book for you!  Please note though, an open mind is an absolute must.	2005-06-23

This is the 2nd book written by author Joel Rothschild (the first being \\"Hope\\"), and I found them to be both beautifully written, and to have a profound message (actually several profound messages).<br /><br />Both of these books describe Joel's battle with AIDS, and how dealing with this disease has changed who he is, and how he views life.  It must be noted that he is one of the longest living people with full blown AIDS - as of the writing of this book, he's been living with this disease for over 15 years!!!<br /><br />\\"Signals\\" takes the story a bit further, as it describes the signs that the author has received from one of his best friends, who was & is living on the \\"Other Side\\", after taking his own life a few years ago.<br /><br />In \\"Hope\\", as well as part of \\"Signals\\", Joel takes you on a journey through his life - the life of an amazing man LIVING with AIDS, however in the majority of \\"Signals\\", he takes you with him on his spiritual journey - you can actually \\"see\\" him growing spiritually, and it's really quite beautiful!<br /><br />Apparently Joel lived most of his life as an agnostic - not sure if there was a God or an after-life because he felt it could not be proven.  However, due to a pact he made with his deceased friend - the pact being that who ever died first would try to send the other a signal to let them know if there was in fact a God and an after-life - Joel got his answer, he got his signal (actually several of them).<br /><br />I would highy recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality & the after-life, as well as those battling a serious illness.

I actually purchased this book \\"by accident\\" a few months ago, and because I had other books that I really wanted to read, this one sat on the shelf until yesterday.  For some reason, instead of continuing to read my new shipment of books, I went to the shelf to pick a book from there - and this was it.  Now that I've read \\"What God Wants\\", I can't tell you how glad I am that I didn't just let it collect dust!  It's truly an amazing, truth-filled book, that I wish everyone was ready to read.<br /><br />In this book, Neale Donald Walsch shows how the seperatism theology, so prevalent in today's organized religions, has helped to create the personal beliefs that have shaped the world we live in - one filled with violence & hatred.  He then states that, in order to fix the situation we've found ourselves in, we need to realize that we are all one - along with God.<br /><br />He questions all of the ideas that many of us were taught as children, laying them out for what they really are, and then asks the reader to decide if they think that that's really what God wants.  He shows how the churches have tended to \\"see\\" God as if \\"He\\" was human - with all the faults, plus several more, that we humans have succomb to.<br /><br />Personally, even as a child I could never reconcile the idea that I was supposed to both love and fear my God - I still don't believe that anyone can do both - not really.  \\"What God Wants\\" explains why we never need to fear God, and why having a bunch of fearful humans is NOT what God wants.  Why would \\"He\\"???<br /><br />This is a very thought provoking book, and quite honestly, I'm not sure that everyone would \\"get it\\".  Although I found it quite easy to read, I've been reading books of a spiritual nature for quite some time now, so I had a basis on which to understand this info.  However, even if you haven't read books on this subject before, I believe that if you have an open mind, and are not bound by any type of dogma, you'll gain a lot from the reading of this book.  I believe that this is such an important book, and I REALLY hope you choose to read it - it could literally change the world!ve that this is such an important book, and I REALLY hope you choose to read it - it could literally change the world!	2005-06-22

I haven't read a good mystery in several years, but when I came across this book, and noticed the bargain price, I decided to give it a try - and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I really enjoyed Jinxed!  Carol Higgins Clark did an excellent job of building up the characters, and the story line was quite easy to follow - not like some of the other mystery books out there, where the story becomes so convoluted that you don't know who's who anymore.<br /><br />Jinxed is about an old silent movie actress, her multi-millions, her young, unscrupulous fiance' & her ex-husband's family who feel they were cheated out of an inheritance (that was all given to the old actress)- and who currently live & run a winery that had been abandoned after prohibition led to its fall.<br /><br />Although you know early on that the fiance is no good, and is only marrying the actress for her money, the mystery surrounds whether or not he will be found out before the wedding day.  There are also several other \\"mini-mysteries\\" within the story, but it's still quite easy to follow.<br /><br />I used to read Carol's mother's books many years ago (Mary Higgins Clark), and although Carol's style is considerably different from that of her mother's, she has proven herself to be an excellent mystery writer as well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery, and who is looking for a relatively easy read.

I purchased & read this book a few months ago, and at the time I honestly wasn't sure how I felt about the idea of a Bible code existing - however, after reading \\"The Bible Code\\", as well as \\"The Bible Code II\\", I am leaning towards believing in the existence of such a code.<br /><br />In this book, Michael Drosnin discusses how he got caught up in the research of this contraversial topic, as well as: what the research shows, who is denying the findings & why, and the adventures he's had trying to bring this info. to the people who can have the largest impact with the data - the government heads of various countries.<br /><br />The author has done an excellent job of pulling the reader into this real life \\"adventure\\" & holding you until the very end (In fact I actually wasn't ready for it to end - I wanted more!).<br /><br />If you are at all interested in learning about the topic of the Bible code, this is the book for you.  I would urge everyone to read it yourself and make up your own mind re: this topic - it's all too easy to listen to the false statements out there that are purported to be true.	2005-06-20

I have, however, read many, many books that deal with the ideas espoused in \\"The Course\\", and I've foud these ideas to make quite a lot of sense!<br /><br />This particular book, \\"Gifts from a Course in Miracles\\", is written in such a way that each major \\"tenet\\" is further broken down into smaller sub-sections - each dealing with a part of the \\"tenet\\" being discussed - and it's written quite similar to the form of a poem.  I really like the format, as it makes the info. easier to digest.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in finding out about the ideas espoused in \\"The Course\\", or even if you're already a student of it, I would highly recommend this book.	2005-06-20

I actually purchased this book several years ago, & I just recently got it out again to re-read - and I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />This book is jam packed with excellent insights designed to help you achieve the joyful life you've always wanted.  It also includes step-by-step instructions on how to get the most from what is offered.<br /><br />The idea behind this book seems to be that we need to change our thoughts before we can change our lives.  I've read many books now on this topic, and I have to say that it makes quite a lot of sense when you take the time to look back on your life and ponder how you got into certain situations, and can realize why your life is how it is today.<br /><br />Each insight in this book is very short - about 1 sentence in length - so it's quite easy to memorize the \\"thought of the day\\" and meditate/ponder on it whenever you get the chance.<br /><br />Once you've come to the realization that your thoughts are greatly impacting your life, this book can be of assistance by providing you with new ways to look at things - ways that can assist you in creating the life of your dreams.<br /><br />I would suggest reading \\"Love is Letting Go of Fear\\" - by this same author, as well as \\"The Power of Intention\\" by Wayne Dyer for more info. on the power of our thoughts, and how to go about changing them so that you're creating the life you want, instead of attracting those things/experiences that you'd really rather avoid.	2005-06-18

We both love to watch them, and are always wondering what type of birds they are.<br /><br />I happened across this book recently & decided to purchase it - at this price, you honestly can't beat it!  Since it was so cheap I didn't expect much, but as I began browsing through it, I was really impressed!  It includes beautiful pictures of many, many different types of birds, and has a lot of great info. on each.  The author also includes chapters on:<br /><br />Understanding birds<br /><br />Birding at home<br /><br />How to go birding<br /><br />The habitat bird finder - this tells you where you can find specific types of birds (i.e. woodlands, shore, etc...)<br /><br />This is a great reference book to have for anyone interested in birds - from the beginner to the \\"pro\\".  I highly recommend it.	2005-06-18

You can achieve this by reading his book \\"The Power of Intention\\" (or listening to the book on CD which I saw is now available).<br /><br />As I stated about Dyer's other meditation CD (Getting in the Gap), this is probably not a great CD for those who are beginners to meditation (a better CD for those just starting would be \\"The Celestine Meditations\\" by Salle Redfield), and it will also be quite difficult if you are needing to meditate within earshot of other people - as you do have to make some sounds that may make you feel uncomfortable if other's can hear you.<br /><br />With those considerations out of the way, I think this is a great meditation CD for those wanting to manifest within their life.  I'd recommend purchasing it so that you have it when you're ready & when you'll be alone.	2005-06-18

This is the 2nd book I've read by this author (Here & Hereafter was the 1st), and I am amazed at how in-depth both books are re: what may await us after death.<br /><br />As I stated in my review of \\"Here & Hereafter\\", I believe that each book on after-death communication has something to offer, but what is brought forth is going to be dependent on where the soul is \\"residing\\" at that time.  It seems to me that it's like the story about the blind trying to describe an elephant - where one feels the trunk & thinks that is what the elephant is, another feels the tail, one feels the ear, and so on...  Each one is partially correct, but not completely - and this is how I see each of the wonderful books out there re: the afterlife.<br /><br />In terms of what this book contains...  It includes info. channeled from the late Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson re: the realm of \\"Heaven\\" that he's been residing in since his death.  Apparently, he had written a book while on earth that has led to the misguidance of many who've read it (it basically stated that info received psychically is \\"of the devil\\").  As a result, he has felt a need to write a book from the \\"Other Side\\" to correct this \\"mistake\\", as well as give an appraisal of what he's experienced since his passing.<br /><br />I found this book to be quite insightful, and filled with the wonders & beauty that will await most of us upon death.  I say \\"most of us\\" because he does discuss the \\"lower realms\\", where those souls go that have led hideaous lives while on earth.  However, it's stated quite clearly that these souls have not been banished to this horrible afterlife, instead, they have complete control in moving themselves up \\"the spiritual ladder\\", and many are waiting to help these souls as soon as they should give up the negativity that binds them there.<br /><br />I found many of the beautiful descriptions to match those given in \\"Within Heaven's Gate\\" - a book about a woman who had an NDE while quite ill.  The main difference is that \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is written from a decidedly christian standpoint, whereas \\"world Unseen\\" specifically states that people from ALL religions (as well as those with no religion at all) inhabit the beautiful realms of Heaven.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in after-death communications &/or the afterlife in general.  A word of caution though, an open mind is needed to gain anything from the reading of this book.e\\" is written from a decidedly christian standpoint, whereas \\"world Unseen\\" specifically states that people from ALL religions (as well as those with no religion at all) inhabit the beautiful realms of Heaven.

I just finished reading \\"Looking for Carroll Beckwith\\", and I must say that the research done by Robert Snow is absolutely exhaustive!  How anyone could question his findings is truly beyond me.<br /><br />Basically, this book is about a police captain who, on a dare, goes to a psychologist for a past-life regression.  During that session, he sees quite a few of his past lives - for several of them, he only saw glimpses of that life, but for 1 of these past lives - that of Carroll Beckwith, he received much information.<br /><br />Not sure what to make of this regression, he sets on a journey where he continually tries to prove that what he saw during the regression was false - that it was just something that his subconcious made up, a fantasy.  However, after his exhaustive research into the life of Carroll Beckwith, he is left realizing that, in fact, what he saw during his regression matches completely with the life of this man from the 1800's.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me throughout this reading was that his wife was completely unsupportive.  It's apparent that she was unable to let go of her current beliefs, even in the face of such unbelievable evidence.  I find that to be quite sad!  It was also amazing to me the lengths Mr. Snow went to to try to show that regressions bring up false memories, as opposed to real past lives.  It made me wonder, how much is enough evidence to prove to you what is staring you right in the face???  But, then again, that's a judgment that is not up to me to make - but, I must say, that this was a bit unnerving to me.<br /><br />Overall, this is an amazing story that I think proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we all have lived past lives at some point in time.  If you are at all interested in this topic, this is a great book to read on the subject.	2005-06-18

There is also a whole section on cream cheese desserts as well.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this cookbook to anyone who loves jell-o gealtin, pudding &/or cream cheese - as well as those who just love dessert in general.	2005-06-18

This book is about how important our thoughts are in creating our experiences, including how they attract certain \\"types\\" of people into our lives.  Exercises are also included to help you utilize these universal laws to attract those experiences/people that you DO WANT, instead of those you'd like to avoid.<br /><br />It's shown that we are responsible for EVERYTHING we experience, as we are the creators of our current life experiences - therefore, it no longer makes sense to spend time blaming others for our plight.  Instead, we need to figure out where we miscreated, and fix it by creating what we do want instead.<br /><br />Although everything makes a lot of sense, and I can see how my thoughts have impacted my life, I still have 1 question... and that is re: the horrible experiences that some children go through - I'm uncertain as to how they brought those experiences into their lives.  But I feel certain that I'll gain a greater understanding of this as I research the other works by this author further.<br /><br />As a side note, the information included in this book was obtained through the channeling of ABRAHAM - a group of entities in the non-physical universe - through Esther Hicks.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in changing some aspect of their life; those interested in universal laws; and those interested in communications from the other side.<br /><br />I would also recommend that you read \\"The Power of Intention\\" by Wayne Dyer, as this is another excellent book on the power of our thoughts, and how we can literally change our life by changing our thoughts.	2005-06-14

When I was a little girl, my parents had bought me several coloring books that included wonderful geometric shapes - I absolutely loved them!  Well, one day last year I got to thinking about how much I loved these particular coloring books, and since I remembered them being quite difficult back then, I started wondering if I might like to get some more and start coloring again.<br /><br />I went on a long and arduous search to find these books (once I get an idea in my mind, I'm like a pit bull until I follow through), but none of the bookstores I went to had any idea of what I was talking about.  Then I happened to do a search on Amazon, and found this mandala coloring book.  Although it isn't exactly the same as what I remember, I fell in love with the beautiful shapes included on each page.<br /><br />Plus, I got a bonus, as I had never heard of a \\"mandala\\" before, and the author gives some info. re: this at the start of this book.<br /><br />I love to sit down with my colored pencils or gel pens, and let the stress melt away as I let my creative mind take over.  I honestly feel like a kid again - and I love that!<br /><br />If you are an adult looking for a creative outlet, someone who's interested in mandalas, and/or one who just simply loves coloring, then this book is for you!	2005-06-09

Since then, I've read many, many books on the topic - and I must say that \\"Hello from Heaven\\" is one of the most comprehensive books on ADC's that I've read to date.<br /><br />If you like reading about loved ones who found hope & solace through ADC's, then you'll love this book - as it's just filled to the brim with such great accounts!  Plus, by reading the many different stories, one can see all the wonderfully various ways that those in spirit attempt to contact us.<br /><br />It appears that ADC's happen quite frequently, and I believe that they happen much more frequently than many of us are aware - as most people don't know what to look for - if they don't see an actual apparition, they don't realize that any communication is being attempted.<br /><br />This is one of those books that can bring hope & solace even to those who've not yet experienced an ADC - just by showing that our spirit does go on, and that we retain our individuality is such a comfort.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in ADC's and/or spirituality in general.  It is definitely an excellent, compelling read!	2005-06-09

All I can say is that she's truly amazing - I have never experienced a reading where EVERYTHING she said was right on, and her future predictions have all come true.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to hear their \\"still small voice within\\" - this is one of the best books out there to date!	2005-06-09

The reader is taken on a journey with Sara & Solomon, learning these important insights in a wonderfully easy-to-understand way.<br /><br />I give this book 2 thumbs up, and recommend it to everyone!

I vividly remember my favorite Aunt teaching me the \\"now I lay me down to sleep\\" prayer when I was about 3 or 4 - and I said this prayer every night before bed until I was old enough to come up with my own.<br /><br />Although I prayed every night, I never really thought about whether or not my prayers would be answered - I guess I just assumed they would be.  That was until I became an adult, and began to realize that some were not being answered at all.  Of course, I realized afterwords that the \\"unanswered prayer\\" is sometimes a blessing in and of itself!<br /><br />This book helps explain why some prayers are answered and others are not, and shows through scientific evidence that there is in fact power in prayer.  This is an amazing breakthrough, as we are now facing a time when prayer is being banned in all of our schools - and yet it's being shown that prayer can be an amazingly wonderful & powerful force.<br /><br />This book also raises some of the issues that may await our physicians now that it has been shown that prayer can in fact help to heal the sick.  Will there be malpractice law suites if a dr. chooses not to pray for his/her patients?  Will people who don't want to be prayed for sue their doctors who have prayed for their health?  These are quite scarey questions!<br /><br />Also, what about the people who choose prayer INSTEAD of western medicine?  Are they really making the right choice?  According to Dr. Dossey, the best route to take when faced with medical crises is to use all that is available to us - western medicine, alternative medicine, AND prayer - no one of these is mutually exclusive.<br /><br />The most important finding though, in my opinion, is that prayer has been found to be equally effective regardless of one's religious beliefs.  Although this finding has upset fundamentalists, I think it's a step in the direction of tolerance towards those who espouse beliefs that are different than our own.  In this respect, as well as other's, this book has the potential to \\"change the world\\"...<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone in the health profession, those suffering ill health, and anyone who is just plain interested in the power of prayer.  The scientific evidence is out, and it appears that prayer has an amazing power - why not utilize this power to help yourself and your fellow man?s respect, as well as other's, this book has the potential to \\"change the world\\"...

Many similarities can be seen between this account, and the accounts of those who've had near-death-experiences.  There is 1 major difference though between this and the other books I've read - and that is that this book is of a decidly christian flare.  Because of this, many of the things stated at the end do not resemble what others have found on their glorious \\"trip\\" to Heaven.<br /><br />It's my firm belief that each of these books has something to offer, as they each describe one \\"mansion\\" of the many that are available to us when we continue with our life after we leave this earth.  It's like the blind describing an elephant - one will describe the trunk and think that's all there is, one the ear, one the body and one the legs - each thinking that what they are feeling is the whole of the elephant.  I feel that way about descriptions of the Afterlife - no one account is complete in its description.<br /><br />Although this book may offend people who are not of the christian faith, I do believe it has a lot to offer to everyone.  I found myself smiling while reading about the beautiful river, sea and temple - and I believe that the descriptions of these in and of themselves make this book a wonderful read.	2005-06-05

The author describes information that was received in various forms, such as near-death experiences, channeling & after-death communication, and draws heavily on many Edgar Cayce readings.<br /><br />Many important insights that were gained from those on the Other Side are discussed, including: 1)Our thoughts become \\"things\\", and have a major effect on ourselves & others; 2)Where we find ourselves after death depends, at least in part, on our beliefs and how we choose to live our current life; 3)We are never alone - our loved ones and guides are always around us; 4)We are not seperate beings, instead we are all interconnected - etc...<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the afterlife &/or Edgar Cayce readings.	2005-06-04

Therefore, if we can realize that we are esentially actors in this dream, we can become detached - watching our life as if we were watching a movie on the screen.<br /><br />According to Paramahansa, the goal of this dream is to bring us all back to God (of which we are a part)- and that through good as well as evil, this is accomplished.<br /><br />Evil is viewed as being essential for us to be able to enjoy the good, because if everything was already perfect, we would be much less likely to realize how wonderful and joyful life can be.  Basically, we need the bad to appreciate the good.<br /><br />Although I agree with many of the viewpoints espoused in this book, there are some that just don't resonate with me - at least not yet.  Of course, this does not mean that they aren't true, it just means that they don't \\"work\\" for me just yet.  Regardless of this slight difference of opinion, I still believe that this is an excellent book on the topic of evil.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone questioning why evil exists in our world.  Even if you don't agree with all of the author's viewpoints, it still offers a lot to think about.	2005-06-04

This is one of those books that holds so much important information, that you need to re-read it several times to benefit from all the insights included within.<br /><br />Overall, this books discusses how the exclusive nature of religions today is actually quite harmful, and that to truly find \\"the truth\\", we need to be willing to listen to eachother, realizing that many times we are actually agreeing - though it may seem as though we're not, because some tend to view things from a more objective, left-brain point of view, while others view the same info. from a more subjective, right-brain point of view.<br /><br />The author then proposes that, in order to truly understand the information (any information), one needs to be able to view things both objectively and subjectively.  In other words, we need to be more inclusive, realizing that EVERYTHING is God.<br /><br />There is such a large number of insights in this book, that if I included even a sentence about each, this review would be way too long.  Suffice it to say, this book is a \\"jewel in the ruff\\", and I would highly recommend it to all who believe in some form of God.  It's an eye opener, and really makes a lot of sense.	2005-06-03

This is truly one of the best \\"how to\\" books out there re: psychic development!  It's basically a 12 week course where, each week, the reader goes through 1 chapter, and then does the exercises included - with each week sort of building on the last.<br /><br />Also included are some great stories about Sonia's experiences, as well as those of her students - I found these to be particularly helpful.  Plus, each chapter had several helpful tips as well.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in developing their psychic potential, as well as those who would just like to be able to \\"hear\\" their intuition a bit clearer.	2005-06-03

I have not yet worked with this CD, but I plan to soon.  When I do, I will add my thoughts on the CD to this review.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in regression therapy.	2005-06-02

I loved reading about the topics of clairvoyance and clairaudiance as it was experienced by a child.<br /><br />This book is basically the publishing of a childhood journal.  It includes the psychic experiences this child had, as well as the way he was treated when speaking about them.  It also includes some everyday childhood \\"stuff\\", but even that was quite interesting.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in psychic development in particular, or metaphysics in general.  It's a highly entertaining read.	2005-06-02

She also touches on her beliefs re: why this is possible.<br /><br />Although I found the info. to be quite interesting, I have to agree with the other reviewers that her writing style is a bit disjointed.  But, if you can get past that, I think it's a worthwhile read.	2005-05-31

It is jam packed with great historical info. re: the sect who created the dead sea scrolls, as well as the various other sects of that time.  It also describes the historical finding of the scrolls, and how they were quite close to being lost to us forever.<br /><br />On another note, this book shows that ancient civilizations dealt with many of the same problems as we do today - violence, prejudice, closed-mindedness, war, etc...  An important point for us to remember.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the dead sea scrolls, as well as those interested in ancient civilizations.  It's an excellent, thought provoking read.	2005-05-31

In the last few years I have read many books on near death experiences, and I must say that this is one of my favorites!<br /><br />Dannion Brinkley writes about the near death journeys he experienced when he was struck by lightening - not once, but twice (how unlucky can one guy be???)!<br /><br />He shows how these experiences changed him - from that of an angry, cynical guy, to one who who is loving & caring.  He also began to have psychic experiences.  From all the books I've read on this topic, it appears that this is a \\"normal\\" transformation for NDErs.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful book on the NDE, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for additional info. on the topic.	2005-05-29

After a violent fight with one of these \\"friends\\", he started to not feel right, and within a few minutes he was dead.<br /><br />The book then goes on to describe the experiences he had while clinically dead, how he was treated by the medical profession after he was brought back to life, and how this experienced impacted his life.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who's had an NDE and is looking to hear of other's experiences, as well as those who are just plain interested in this topic.	2005-05-28
US	31844968	RJG43MUY3A9UI	0963643533	41770794	Here and Hereafter	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	Quite Interesting!	For several years now, I've been reading as many books on spiritual topics as I can find - I just can't seem to get enough.  One of my interests is in the topic of the afterlife, and I love to read books about what the spirits on the \\"other side\\" have to say about where they are now.<br /><br />Although there is no way to prove that what is written in these books is actually true, I believe that each of these types of books provide at least a grain of truth.  Kind of like the blind trying to describe an elephant - What you \\"see\\" or believe as truth is directly related to \\"where you're standing\\" at that time.<br /><br />This particular book describes many aspects of life on the other side, according to the spirits who communicate with Anthony Borgia.  It goes into quite a lot of detail - even about things that would seem mundane to us.  But, I think that's why I like this book - it doesn't just focus on the \\"big picture\\", it gets into the \\"nitty gritty\\" of life after death.<br /><br />The picture painted is a beautiful one, and I can only hope that Heaven really is as it's described here.  However, it's explained that not everyone goes to the same level, so we may not all experience the same things - it depends on: where we're at spiritually, what our beliefs are (it appears that, to at least some extent, we get what we believe - at least at the beginning), and the type of life we lived here on earth.<br /><br />I definitely \\"felt\\" a ring of truth while reading this book - something that does not happen with every book I read on this topic.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality & ideas on the after-life - but, bring an open mind!	2005-05-25

This little book, filled with much wisdom, can be summed up in this one sentence:<br /><br />\\"All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts\\".<br /><br />Overall, this book is about taking responsibility for your lot in life - the good and the bad - as it can all be traced to the thoughts you entertain day in and day out.  It also shows how our thoughts directly impact our character - we are what we think - How true!!!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone interested in changing some aspect of their life.  It is less than 70 pages & can be read in less than an hour, but its effects could last a lifetime.	2005-05-24

Since I am interested in studying various religious ideas, I figured that this would be a good book to start with in helping me to understand just what Kabbalah is all about.<br /><br />Because of my lack of kabbalistic knowledge, I am unable to critique whether the info. contained in this book is an accurate reflection of the beliefs held by kabbalists today; however, I must say that at the end, I was still asking myself \\"so what are the major tenets of this religion?\\".<br /><br />Although it's clear that reincarnation is a major belief, much of the info. in this book seems convoluted, and it just plain didn't make much sense to me.<br /><br />I came to this book with an open mind, hoping to find some insights I could incorporate with my current beliefs, but I honestly feel as if I gained very little understanding of this religion, and no usable insights.	2005-05-23

Just by reading these accounts, I found myself being impacted in the same way.  It's amazing just how quickly we forget the importance of the \\"small stuff\\" as we go through our daily routines!<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in afterlife communications, psychic phenomena &/or spirituality.	2005-05-21

I plan to recommend it to many of my family & friends - & I highly recommend it to you too!<br /><br />The chapters in this book are actually categorized as \\"souls\\" - each one dealing with 1 person who came to \\"the Listener\\" in a broken state, and left healed (in more ways than one).<br /><br />This book has the potential to really hit home - showing that we ALL have problems (no one is immune), and that we are NEVER really alone - a concept that is so easy to forget these days.<br /><br />I don't want to spill the beans re: who the listener is, but after you read the first chapter you'll instinctivly know (if not by the first chapter, then definitely by the second).  Once your realize who it is, it will serve as a reminder that we all have a \\"listener\\" - available any time, day or night.	2005-05-19

The author describes, in less than 30 pages, how to create the life you want by writing your goals, or \\"wants\\" down, reading them 3 times per day, and thinking about them as much as possible.<br /><br />Although the author doesn't describe why it works, it makes sense in light of other books I've read (such as \\"The Power of Intention\\" by Dr. Wayne Dyer).  Basically, by writing your \\"wants\\" down, you are sending out an intention into the world - and we tend to get what we intend.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is definately worth getting - you can't beat $2.00!  Try it, it may just work!	2005-05-17

After reading it, I bought several more copies and gave them to friends and family as gifts - everyone I've talked to thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Without getting into too much detail, this book is about an old carnival worker who has had quite a difficult life.  Just before he's ready to retire, he gets killed trying to save a little girls life - and he doesn't know, until the end, whether or not he succeeded.  He feels as if his life was a waste - a TOTAL waste unless he had saved the girls life.<br /><br />After death, he meets 5 people in \\"Heaven\\" - learning a bit about the true impact of his life from each.  Each person shows him how he effected his/her life - for better or for worse.<br /><br />We can learn from this book that each and every one of us does have an impact - positive or negative - on many more people on this earth than we could ever imagine.  In many cases, our effects can be felt by people we have never even met.  An interesting thought to ponder!<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent book, and a very quick read (it can be finished in one sitting).  Quite frankly, I would recommend it everyone!	2005-05-15

This is the 2nd book I've read by this author, and I've been greatly inspired by both.  Mr. Mandino is an amazing writer!  He's able to weave important insights throughout his fictional tales, and keeps the reader on their toes - not wanting to the put the book down until it's finished.<br /><br />The overall gist of this book is that we all have choices re: what we do, how we do it, and how we react to the circumstances we find ourselves in - and it's these choices (sometimes seemingly mudane) that determine the life we live today, as well as our potential future.<br /><br />This seems to be a concept that many of us have forgotten - we do, in fact, have choices!  It's up to us to choose wisely, and to correct the choices we're not happy with.  But, either way, we must take responsibility for whatever our choices are - and where they lead us.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in changing any part of their life, as well as those trying to help others to understand the impact of their choices - this book provides a wonderful story to share with those who are currently struggling.	2005-05-14

I found this book to be REALLY interesting - and quite insightful.<br /><br />Basically, Rosemary helps the reader determine their own \\"soul sign\\", as well as the \\"soul signs\\" of others, through a categorization based on the elements (i.e. fire, water, air, etc...).<br /><br />This info. can then be used to help the reader understand why they get along so well with some people and not others, and the best \\"type\\" of person for you - in terms of friendships and relationships.<br /><br />After getting this book, I went ahead and figured out the \\"soul signs\\" of those close to me - and found the info. to be on target.  The insights I gained helped me to understand why I am able to get along so well with some of these people, and yet feel like pulling my hair out with others.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in astrology-related ideas.	2005-05-13

I just received my copy of this book today, and I've already finished reading it - a testament to just how good it is.  I honestly couldn't put it down!<br /><br />In \\"Return From Tomorrow\\", George Ritchie describes his near-death experience - his glimpses of the self-imposed levels of hell, as well as the beauty inherent in the various levels of Heaven.  He makes clear that God & Jesus are pure love, and that there is no such thing as being sentenced to a firey Hell.  The Hells we experience are of our own making - by holding onto negative feelings such as hate & prejudice.<br /><br />This book rang true for me, but we all must decide for ourselves what the \\"truth\\" really is.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in near-death experiences, the spiritual realms, &/or spirituality in general.	2005-05-12

Although it's a REALLY short book, it's filled with wonderful, important insights for all those reading it with an open mind.<br /><br />Richard Bach uses the life of a seagull to examine the importance of following your dreams, and to highlight the reasons why many of us tend to give up - at times before we've even really tried.  These reasons include: fear of what other's might think of us; being considered different from everyone else (and at times this leading to being seen as \\"bad\\"); and the inability for us to KNOW that we can do it - we can do ANYTHING we put our minds to.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to everyone with an open mind.  I also think this would be a great book to read to children - the very young may not be able to grasp its implications, but I bet those around 8yrs. and up could understand the meaning if the parents discuss it afterwards.	2005-05-12

I absolutely love her writing style - it's as if you are talking to a long, lost friend - as well as the insights she provides throughout.<br /><br />Although parts of this book are quite graphic (in terms of the abuse she suffered as a child and young adult), I think it's necessary for the reader to truely understand what she's gone through to be able to understand her personal spiritual journey.  These parts are a bit hard to get through - becuase you feel such a sense of horror that she had to go through these things - but I commend her for being strong enough within herself to share them with all the world.  I am sure that through this sharing, she has helped countless others who've experienced similar abuses.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to those who are on their own spiritual journey, as well as those interested in the subject of spirituality.  A word of caution though, an open mind is needed in order to gain the full impact of the insights offered.	2005-05-12

At that time, I quite honestly didn't know how to handle the loss of my career, my hobbies & my independance - a lot to deal with all at once!  Needless to say, I was scared beyond belief!!!  Plus, since the accident was caused by another person who just wasn't paying attention, I had a seething anger toward this person who I didn't even know (and I still don't even know her name!).<br /><br />Back then, someone recommended this book to me, and it was a tremendous help!  The first time I read it, I just wasn't ready to let go of the negative feelings I was harboring - but a couple of years later I read it again, and it has made such a difference in my life!<br /><br />In a nut shell, Dr. Jampolsky discusses the concepts of love and fear - defining fear as the absence of love.  He shows how, in order for us to live a life filled with love, we have to let go of our fears - and to do this, we need to get rid of our need to analyze & contemplate the negative experiences of our past and the potential for negative events to occur in our future - we need to let go of the \\"what ifs\\".  Stop waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br /><br />Much of the info. included in this book is drawn from \\"A Course in Miracles\\", although you don't need to have an understanding of \\"the course\\" to gain from the insights in this book - I still haven't gotten around to reading \\"the course\\" myself.<br /><br />If you like Marianne Williamson's writing, you'll definately enjoy this book by Dr. Jampolsky.	2005-05-11

The info. included on these CD's is truely invaluable!<br /><br />John's easy going manner is apparent throughout, and I enjoyed how he showed his humorous side here and there.  His speech is a bit fast paced, but that's just John - if you've ever watched him on t.v., you'll notice that he is a fast talker by nature - although he does appear to try to \\"take it down a notch\\" in these CD's.<br /><br />This set is perfect for the novice, as well as those who are more experienced in the psychic realms.  He discusses everything you need to know to increase your psychic sensitivity.<br /><br />He starts out discussing the importance of meditation, and includes several guided meditations within the various CD's.  He also discusses: auras, psychic protection, guides & angels, ethics, and much, much more.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in increasing your psychic awareness, this CD set is for you!

My copy is still being passed about, and it's been going from person to person for over a year now!<br /><br />I think it's probably the best \\"fiction\\" book I've ever read - I put \\"fiction\\" in quotations because I tend to believe that some parts are based on things that actually happened within John's life - how could it not???  But, then again, I tend to think this is true of many books of \\"fiction\\".<br /><br />I hesitate to say too much about the story because I don't want to ruin the ending for those who haven't read it yet.  Suffice it to say that it's about a large, loving family that is going through the pain of watching a loved one die.  But, please don't get the idea that it's ALL sad - there is plenty of humor scattered throughout.  I found myself laughing at parts, and then crying soon after - I'd suggest making sure to have some tissues nearby while reading this book.  And, be ready for a surprise ending...<br /><br />There's much to be gained from reading this book - the most important of which is letting those people you love know it while they are still on this earth - something we should all remember (but it's just so easy to forget).	2005-05-11

This is the first book I ever read on the subject of past-life regression (I actually read this book several years ago), and I found it to be absolutely fascinating.  In fact, it sparked such an interest in me that I now devour all books on this topic - and am still amazed by what I read!<br /><br />In this particular book, Dr. Weiss discusses his sessions with a particular patient whose symptoms were not being helped through traditional therapy.  Since he had done age regressions in the past, he decided to try it with this patient - only instead of regressing to a younger age in this life, the patient was actually regressed to a prior life - where the cause of her symptoms had actually started.<br /><br />Then, the patient started bringing forth info. that was specifically meant for Dr. Weiss - and when questioned about who this info. was coming from, she stated it was from the \\"Masters\\".<br /><br />Dr. Weiss, being of a scientific nature, was naturally skeptical at the beginning, and part of this book deals with the Dr.'s process of accepting the possibility of past lives, as well as the idea that there were spiritul guides (or masters) that were really trying to communicate with him.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent book for anyone even slightly interested in the possibility of past lives.  Although I was a bit skeptical at the start of this book, by the end I became a definate believer in the idea that we live many, many lives - learning and growing with each one.  I am thankful that I found this book - or maybe it found me???	2005-05-10

Although it has been a difficult road, one of the positive effects is that it somehow led me to start a spiritual journey - a quest to understand life in general, and myself in particular.<br /><br />This is one of the first \\"spiritual\\" books I came across that piqued my interest, and I am definately glad I bought it!  Marianne's style of writing made it easy for the \\"beginner\\" to grasp her insights - and I was definately a beginner to this genre at the time.<br /><br />Overall, this book speaks about the importance of love - and how the ego tends to get in our way of truely feeling and expressing love. Although I have not yet read \\"A Course in Miracles\\", Marianne states that her beliefs are deeply connected to it.<br /><br />At the time, although I had learned about the ego in college, I had never of thought of it in the terms she described.  She shows through example how the ego, if left un-checked, can lead us to dwell on the negative (and even search for it in instances where it doesn't exist).  But the overall message of this book is that only love is REAL - and that we must all learn to love ourselves, as well as others - even those we can't imagine loving.  What a beautiful message!<br /><br />I would recommend this book anyone interested in spirituality &/or \\"A Course in Miracles\\".  Be sure to \\"bring\\" an open mind.	2005-05-10

I have been reading spiritual books for several years now - and every once in a while I come across a real \\"jewel\\" - and this is such a book.<br /><br />Although the story line is quite simplistic, I found this to be an asset with this particular book - as it allows the reader to truly follow the insights provided throughout.<br /><br />If you are someone who is searching for spiritual answers, and just can't reconcile the idea that we are supposed to both love & fear our Creator, this book is for you.  It shows how we, as humans, tend to project our flaws onto God (such as jealousy and hate), instead of recognizing that God is LOVE - UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.<br /><br />The lessons in this book are so vitally important, that I would recommend it to EVERYONE!  However, I must note that an open mind is required in order to gain anything from the reading of this book.	2005-05-10

In the last few years I have read many spiritual books, and this is now one of my favorites.<br /><br />The author draws on the readings of Edgar Cayce, as well as the views of several others, to discuss the realms that await us after death.  A great asset of this book is that it shows how our thoughts and beliefs will actually impact the realm we find ourselves in upon death.  For instance, although God does not damn anyone to a hellish afterlife, if someone believes that that is what they will find, they will. However, no one is stuck in a \\"negative\\" realm forever - there is always help available to those who are ready to give up their \\"earth-bound\\" thoughts.<br /><br />The author also discusses the importance of prayer and meditation in preparing our souls for the afterlife, and he has included several exercises to help readers with the process.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality, the after-life, &/or Edgar Cayce's readings.	2005-05-09

This book is truly amazing, in that it provides the reader with a way to change their life - showing how we can co-create with God the type of life we really want to live.  It shows how we all tend to \\"accidentally\\" create those things in our lives that we actually want to avoid - by constantly dwelling on the negative in our life, we are actually attracting more negative events to us.  This book is about changing the way we think - and by changing our thoughts, we begin to change our lives along the way.<br /><br />Dr. Dyer does a great job of outlining the steps necessary to change the thought processes that are currently hindering our ability to live the life we want.<br /><br />Although I would categorize this book as \\"spiritual\\" in nature, I believe that it can be of help to EVERYONE - whether you are interested in sprituality &/or religion or not.<br /><br />This is one of those books that can truly help anyone to change their life - as long as one is willing to put in the effort involved in changing their thought processes.  It shows how our INTENTIONS impact every facet of our lives - and that, by changing our INTENTIONS, we can literally transform our life!	2005-05-09

This is one of the first \\"spiritual\\" books I ever read, and it's lessons continue to impact my life!<br /><br />The most important lesson is that of the \\"ripple effect\\" - that the way we treat others impacts many more lives than we could ever imagine.  For instance, if you are having a bad day, and are ignorant to a cashier at the local supermarket, chances are you haven't just had a negative impact on her. If she becomes agitated by your ignorance, she may become nasty to her other customers - who then become agitated and treat the other people they encounter in a negative manner.  So, your nastyness to 1 person could literally impact hundreds (maybe even thousands) of people in one day.<br /><br />This also works in a positive way - if you are pleasant, and go out of your way to help another, their appreciation will have a ripple effect.  Chances are that they will then do something nice for someone else - and on and on - until your 1 nice deed has impacted hudreds (or even thousands) of people in a positive way.<br /><br />Looking at the world as it is today, I tend to think that many of us just don't realize the impact we have on those we come into contact with.<br /><br />Overall, because this concept is of such importance today, I would recommend this book to EVERYONE!	2005-05-09

After coming across this book in a used book store, I, like many of the other reviewers, couldn't put it down.  This is the first book I've read by Lysa Mateu, and I look forward to reading her future works!<br /><br />The information Lysa brought forth was amazing and comforting - and her style of writing is commendable - she makes you feel as if she's talking directly to you.<br /><br />I have been reading spiritual books for several years now - Spurred on by a major car accident that has left me in chronic pain - and this is definately one of my favorites!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the \\"After-Life\\" &/or psychic phenomena.

Although most of us have heard the term \\"everything happens for a reason\\", and we've all probably said it to comfort ourselves and other's when we're faced with an issue for which there seems to be no answer, I think many of us fail to really UNDERSTAND this term.  Like many other sayings, the reason why we've heard this term stated over and over again is because there is truth within it.<br /><br />This book leads the reader to question the hidden reasons behind certain events in their lives.  If there really is a reason, then what could it be?  In order to find the answer to this question, one might need to dig deep within their soul - but the fact is that there IS a reason for EVERYTHING we go through - although we may not discover it for many years.<br /><br />The author's style of writing made this book an easy, and enjoyable read.  Although it can be finished relatively quickly, its impact will last a lifetime.	2005-05-09

Mr. Berlitz first describes the disappearances that have occurred in the region, and then discusses the possible causes for them.  Some great photographs are also included.<br /><br />The only reason I've given this book a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\" is that the author tends to go off on tangents - all of which I found quite interesting - however, I think it may have been better had he left some of this info. to another book.<br /><br />I would definately recommend purchasing this book (although you'll have to find a used copy) for anyone interested in the Bermuda Triangle, or ancient mysteries in general.	2005-05-08

I agree with the other reviewer that this book is most definately worth searching for!<br /><br />This is one of those books that haunts you.  In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget Barbara Maddox and all that she went through.<br /><br />This book makes us realize that there really is evil lurking about - quite possibly in people we would consider to be up-standing individuals (a really scarey thought!).  But it also shows that the light of God is an ever-present source - that doesn't give up easily!<br /><br />This book also points out the fact that law enforcement just isn't ready to take these claims seriously - what a sad state of affairs for those who've been tortured by satanists to then be tortured by the system as well!<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology - however, one must have a strong stomach to handle many of the gory details involved.	2005-05-05

I have always been interested in ancient Egypt, but I hadn't read anything new for many years - until a few months ago, when I started reading on the subject again.<br /><br />So far I've found that many of the books on this topic are quite dry - with a few glaring exceptions, this being one of them.<br /><br />This author looks at the evidence in spiritual and mystical terms - and I must say, his interpretations seem to make quite a lot of sense!  For instance, he shows evidence that the ancient Egyptians were not polytheistic - in fact, they were quite adamant that there was only one \\"true source\\".<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic, & who is ready to look at the evidence from a fresh perspective.  This book is ideal for those interested in spirituality.	2005-05-03

I actually read this book several years ago, and passed it around to family and friends to read as well - and we all thought this was an amazing book!<br /><br />Although it's written in a fictional context, there are many great real-life insights included.  In fact, these insights are continued with Redfield's next book \\"The 10th Insight\\" (which is another of my favorites).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in meta-physics.  Looking back, I believe this was probably my first book on the topic, and although it was fiction, it opened my mind to this genre.	2005-05-01

I came across this book by chance, and really wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away by both the premise and the author's knack of expressing difficult phenomena in an easy to understand manner.<br /><br />One of the great assets of this book is the way the author takes you on a journey with him to many amazing historical sights.  He has also included photographs that help in imagining the appearance of the wonderous architecture.<br /><br />He also takes you on a journey through his thought processes - so you can actually see how and why his theories are borne - as well as his searching for any scientific data to back up his thoughts (of which there is much).<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems as though many of the scientists today are quite willing to \\"close their eyes\\" to anything that doesn't match their current beliefs.  This is something I have seen in many areas, and this is no different.  To me, this is a sad state of affairs, and I truly hope that a younger generation of scientists will be willing to get excited about the seeming anomalies, and really check them out.  Until this happens, much of the world will be kept in the dark about some of the magnificent finds of the past and present.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of ancient Egypt and Mexico.  However, be warned, this book MUST be approached with an open mind.	2005-05-01

I have read most of Weiss's books to date, and I believe (unlike some of the other reviewers) that his books do leave you thinking - or maybe a better word would be wondering.<br /><br />The premise of this book is that what we've done in previous lives have determined, in part, the types of obstacles we face in this life (or lack thereof).  It also leads you to realize, through example, that what we're doing in this life is going to have a direct impact on the types of obstacles we'll encounter in our future life times.<br /><br />This theory really makes one wonder about how they're living today - and maybe help some of us to realize that we need to make some changes, lest we have to go through the same obstacles next time!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of past & future lives - although one must approach this subject with a completely open mind!	2005-05-01

The reasons I found this odd is that: 1) the amount of work involved to use his method without a computer is absolutely astonishing - so I question whether the amount of info. he was able to de-code could be done in the amount of time he's been working on this project; and 2)It was discovered that Einstein had worked at finding the Bible code for many, many years before his death (in fact most of the notes found of his were his attempt to find a code in the Bible that he was sure existed) - yet he failed to do so.  The theory that's been postulated (that I tend to agree with), is that the modern computer was the key to unlock this code, and it was Einstein's lack of a computer that led to his failure.<br /><br />There are other reasons why I wasn't crazy about this book as well, but I'm just not into \\"bashing\\" an author's style - so I will refrain from listing them.  My comments above are also not meant as a \\"bashing\\", but rather a questioning...<br /><br />Overall, it probably isn't a bad book to get if you're interested in the subject, but I would recommend reading \\"The Bible Code\\" & \\"The Bible Code II\\" first.	2005-04-27

This is the first book I've read on the subject of Atlantis, and I found it quite interesting indeed!<br /><br />Because I am not sure about my thoughts re: aliens being behind the amazing achievments attributed to this \\"lost civilization\\", I was happy to find that the author does not dwell on this possibility (although it's clear that she does believe in the theory of aliens bringing their technological info. to several areas during the time of Atlantis).  Instead, the idea of aliens is brought up only briefly, and then scattered here & there throughout the book - but not in an overbearing sort of way.<br /><br />I read this book at the same time as \\"Finger-Prints of the Gods\\", by Graham Hancock (In fact, I am still finishing up reading \\"Fingerprints\\"), and I found that these books tend to complement eachother.  The one main difference being that Graham Hancock takes the reader on a journey with him to places where there is still evidence that such amazingly brilliant cultures existed in our far-reaching past.  Also, I have not yet come across any mention of aliens in his book (although I haven't completed it yet).<br /><br />I would recommend this book, as well as \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\", to anyone interested in this subject.  Both of these books have a lot to offer and, in the end, will make the reader think about the various possibilities, and come up with their own theories.  In my view, this is what a good book does - encourages the reader to really think about things both as they were, and as they currently are.  And both of these books \\"fit the bill\\".	2005-04-24

I have purchased quite a few meditation CD's in last year or so, and this is by far one of the best!<br /><br />Wayne Dyer's voice is extremely peaceful - which is quite important when attempting to meditate (I have found that the author's voices on several other meditation CD's actually agitate me so that I absolutely cannot relax!).<br /><br />Through this CD, I have reached that point where I am so relaxed that I actually start \\"falling into myself\\" - it's a hard feeling to describe, but it feels absolutely wonderful!<br /><br />The only downfall to practicing this type of meditation is that it's hard to do when anyone is within ear-shot - as you have to make sounds that can be heard by others.  But, this is the ONLY downfall!!!<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this CD & book set to anyone interested in meditation.  If you are just starting to learn to meditate, and will need to do it with other people in the house, you may want to start off with something different (like the Celestine Meditation CD) - but I would get this CD anyway so that you'll have it when you're ready.	2005-04-23

This is an excellent book, but I must say that at the end I was still left wanting...and quite sad!<br /><br />The author pulls you in effortlessly, and I believe she does a good job of keeping the reader interested, but it seemed as though all of her \\"contacts\\" were of the lower levels of Heaven - and I think I just needed to hear some more positive statements from beyond.  However, I do believe that it's important for us still here physically to realize that the afterlife may not be all a \\"bed of roses\\".  That it very well may be whatever we make it - at least to some extent.<br /><br />That's what makes this book different though - It isn't just about the wonder and beauty of the afterlife - It points out how and why some souls become \\"lost\\" (not really lost forever, just until they realize that they are creating that negative reality).<br /><br />After reading this book, I found myself praying for those \\"lost\\" souls - the ones who were frightened and alone.  I was also scared - scared that such a thing could happen at all, and questioning why... Why couldn't/wouldn't God or their guides or angels step in and help them?  The author does discuss this through the letters, but I was still left questioning.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good book for anyone interested in the subject of the afterlife.  If read along with some of the other books on the subject that deal mostly with the wonder and beauty of it, I believe it will give the reader a more balanced understanding - from which each of us can draw our own beliefs and theories.	2005-04-23

The idea of being able to benefit from these experiences without actually having to go through one yourself is wonderfully insightful!<br /><br />This is the first book I've come across that not only suggests that we can all benefit from the NDE's of others, but takes it a step further to suggest excercises that will help us to achieve this.<br /><br />I am currently working on some of these excercises, and have already noticed a change in how I communicate with others - I'm hoping that as I practice more, these positive changes will become a habit.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in NDE's.	2005-03-28

I just finished reading \\"A Change of Heart\\" - Claire Sylvia & William Novak's original book.  It's currently no longer in print, so I wound up ordering it from a used bookstore.  It appears that the reprint is now available - with a slight title change (it now incl. \\"A Memoir\\").<br /><br />At any rate, I found this book to be truely amazing!  The basic premise is that Claire went through a heart & lung transplant, and afterward, she noticed some major changes in her personality (i.e. likes and dislikes) - was it due to the fact that she now had another person's heart and lungs within her?  That is a question that you are left to answer for yourself.<br /><br />I like the fact that this book explains what was occuring through Claire's point of view, and then goes on to discuss many other \\"experts\\" ideas as to why these things were happening.  No one idea is pushed on the reader - the information is layed out for you to make your own decision.<br /><br />I believe that this book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who has gone through a transplant, knows someone who has, or is just plain interested in happenings that cannot currently be explained by western science.  An open mind is a must!<br /><br />P.S.  This book also reminds us of just how important it is to check that little box on your license & become an organ donor.

At first I thought that the book was a bit expensive - but after reading it, I must say that the information included is truely invaluable!<br /><br />The authors not only give examples of EVP, but they also provide detailed information to help other's get results via this method (as well as methods using a video camera & TV).<br /><br />This is an excellent read for anyone with an interest in the \\"paranormal\\" - an open mind is a must!	2005-03-28

When I first purchased this book, I was just not \\"open\\" enough to entertain the ideas brought forth within it.  I read 1 chapter and quickly put it away - figuring that I had just wasted my money.<br /><br />However, about 1 year later (When I had run out of reading material and was waiting for my next shipment of books), I decided to give this book one more try.  This time, I could not put it down!  The experiences described were absolutely mind blowing to me!!!<br /><br />I have since purchased several copies of this book to give to friends - who have also said that they couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This is one of those books that will leave you pondering,  asking yourself \\"could this really be what it's like on the other side?\\"...<br /><br />Overall, I think that it's a \\"must read\\" for all those people who are searching for answers, and are willing to entertain ideas that may seem to contradict what they've been taught previously.  Although it may not be appropriate for the seeker who is just starting to expand their ideas on this subject, it's definately an excellent read for those who've been researching this topic for a little while (and, again, are able to be open to new ideas).	2005-03-22

In fact, I read the entire trilogy (nearly 600 pages) in just a few days!<br /><br />I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the metaphysical.  Although it's fiction, I believe it shares some of the \\"real\\" views of the author - apparently obtained during her messages from Seth (I haven't yet read her \\"Seth\\" books yet, so I can't be certain about this).<br /><br />Basically, this is a story about the journey & subsequent learning of a non-physical being - oversoul seven, and his many teachers along the way.  It is beautifully written, and such a page turner, that I only wished there was more stories of the adventures of this quirky soul.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in the \\"metaphysical\\", or enjoy this authors books re: Seth, I would highly recommend \\"The Oversoul Seven Trilogy\\" - the author presents some of the most difficult of concepts in an easy, enjoyable way.  I can't speak highly enough about this book!	2005-03-19
