Marie-Louise von Franz is their Honorary Patron with 9 of her classic titles in the offerings. The publisher's charter was \\"...founded in 1980 to promote the understanding and practical application of the work of C.G. Jung. \\"  Since then they've published over 110 titles in this series with other prolific Jungian authors such as Barbara Hannah, Edward Edinger, and Marion Woodman to name a few. Hollis is a Zurich-trained Jungian analyst practicing out of Texas where he is also the Executive Director of the Jung Educational Center of Houston. He's contributed 8 titles to the Studies in Jungian Psychology series himself. His most recent book (from a different publisher) titled: \\"Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life - How to Finally, Really Grow Up\\" is receiving critical acclaim as well. Incidentally, the author and I recently shared some correspondence and I found him to be warm, helpful, responsive and thoughtful.<br /><br />The audio version of The Middle Passage is unabridged on 4 CD's with the author narrating in a calm, clear, and agreeable tone of voice with an elegant economy and effectiveness of words. I own a treasured, well-worn print copy of the 128-page book that is liberally underlined, dog-eared, and grossly highlighted.<br /><br />Whether reading the book or listening to the author narrate, I am nearly overwhelmed at the compactness of meaning in his tightly composed sentences. This sense of being overwhelmed is most assuredly not a bad thing - it's a welcome invitation for re-listening to the audio book during my daily commute (a 95 mile round trip to work and home in southern California traffic gives nearly two hours of listening time!). Plus I get opportunities to reread the printed book as time permits as I have a new addition to the family - this equates to sleepless nights with our newborn baby boy...<br /><br />Anyhow, it's a real pleasure opening this book and unpacking the riches within - and treasures they are! I reach into the bag and there are the gems, the gold in the content - but it's packed so tightly as to need diligent & mindful mining. I unpack the words, the sentences, and paragraphs and air them out, taking the concepts down different avenues of thought to glean new insights into the character of my self. I can't tell you the number times I've had \\"AHA!\\" moments - or the sublime experience where some subtle material gestated over time, gelling into meaningful mini-epiphanies. I can't tell you because it won't stop! A most gratifying experience!<br /><br />I have only one minor criticism of this great contribution to Jungian analysis/literature. I can imagine some people possibly being turned off by the author's complex wording which might appear a bit pedantic on the surface. Some of the arguably abstract/esoteric language is not common to a layman's lexis yet they pose a rewarding challenge for the diligent reader. Here's a sample of random rarified words & phrases for example: existential angst, imagos, ineluctable dialectic, the modern Zeitgeist, politic real, portmanteau and (ready?) Jung's awesome word Auseinandersetzung. I've had to grant myself a little time adjusting to his rich vocabulary. Nevertheless it is a cogent, logical and lucid narrative where Hollis carefully defines his terms in the context of recognized Jungian terminology.<br /><br />Hollis uses an abundance of prominent literary and historical figures including Christ, Dante, Stephen Dunn, T.S. Eliot, Nikos Kazantzakis, Nietzsche, Rainer Maria Rilke, Dylan Thomas, St. Thomas, Thoreau, Yeats, and C.G. Jung is well deployed throughout the text.<br /><br />A two-part bibliography gives a listing of select publications segregated by major categories such as: On Midlife, On Women, On Men, On Relationship, Typology, and Inner Work. The other half is a General Bibliography providing a comprehensive list of his sources cited. It also has a pretty good index. Generous footnotes throughout the pages helpfully clarify certain points and direct the reader to relevant sources.<br /><br />Characteristic of Hollis' Socratic bent, \\"Who am I apart from the roles I have played?\\" (from the preface) is the first of many questions posed in Middle Passage. The following passages from the preface effectively capture critical sentiment worth reflection: \\"Many of us pass through life as if it were a novel. We pass from page to page passively, assuming the author will tell us on the last page what it was all about...on the last page we die, with or without illumination.\\" Hollis tells us \\"The invitation of the Middle passage is to become conscious, accept responsibility for the rest of the pages and risk the largeness of life to which we are summoned.\\"<br /><br />In the first chapter, \\"The Provisional Personality\\", he uses the language of Jungian principles to reveal the genesis and evolution of childhood wounding resulting from internalized interpretations of adult conflict (particularly with respect to parental and cultural influences) and the subsequent development of unconscious complexes. He tells us \\"...the person one has been is to be replaced by the person to be...One is summoned, psychologically, to die unto the old self so that the new might be born.\\" He concludes the chapter with \\"...the Middle Passage represents a summons from within to move from the provisional life to true adulthood, from the false self to authenticity.\\"<br /><br />Making a comprehensive review of the rest of the book would prove too lengthy; however I've listed the remaining chapters below and will conclude with a review of one last chapter after the list:<br /><br />Chapter 2 - The Advent of the Middle Passage<br /><br />Tectonic Pressures and Seismic Intimations<br /><br />A New Kind of Thinking<br /><br />Changes in Identity<br /><br />Withdrawal of Projections<br /><br />Changes in the Body and Sense of Time<br /><br />The Diminution of Hope<br /><br />The Experience of Neurosis<br /><br />Chapter 3: The Turn Within<br /><br />The Persona-Shadow Dialogue<br /><br />Relationship Problems<br /><br />Midlife Affairs<br /><br />From Child to Parent to Child<br /><br />The World of Work: Job Versus Vocation<br /><br />Emergence of the Inferior Function<br /><br />Shadow Invasions<br /><br />Chapter 4: Case Studies in Literature (see below)<br /><br />Chapter 5: Individuation: Jung's Myth for Our Time<br /><br />Chapter 6: On the High Seas and Alone<br /><br />From Loneliness to Solitude<br /><br />Connecting with the Lost Child<br /><br />The Passionate Life<br /><br />The Swamplands of the Soul<br /><br />The Great Dialectic<br /><br />Momento Mori<br /><br />This Luminous Pause<br /><br />One chapter in particular has grown on me: in Case Studies in Literature Hollis explores and illuminates new perspectives into the shadow with fascinating analysis of some classic, well recognized literary works.

He's contributed 8 titles to the Studies in Jungian Psychology series himself. We recently shared some correspondence and I found him warm and thoughtfully responsive.<br /><br />After a nice Publisher's Forward by Daryl Sharp, Hollis tells us early in his introduction \\"One way of looking at this journey is to observe that psyche presents us with two large questions...\\" one for each of the two halves of our lives. The question of the first half is '\\"What is the world asking of me?\\" and that of the second is \\"What, now, does the soul; ask of me?\\" To the first he remembers when, as children, we asked the great mysterious questions only to relinquish the profound imperative: \\"The wonder and terror forgotten, buried but not dead beneath the details of the daily grind.\\" And, sadly \\"...we forgot those questions, and who we were, and that we were really called upon to do something with this gift of life.\\" To the second question (for the second half of life) Hollis offers up some poignant questions to be asked (but not necessarily answered) by honest, humble, self-seekers willing to ask and grow. These ten questions are reflected in the Table of Contents and are expanded in each chapter to flesh out the real meaning of the questions. However Hollis does not \\"...purport to offer their answers, though I present possibilities.\\"<br /><br />By What Truths Am I Living My Life?<br />What Is My Shadow and How Can I Make It Known?<br />What Is My Myth?<br />What Is My Vocation?<br />What Are My Spiritual Points Of Reference?<br />What Fiction Shall Be My Truth?<br />What Is My Obligation to the World?<br />So, Ahem . . . What's This Death Business?<br />What Supports Me?<br />What Matters, in the End?<br /><br />In his chapter \\"What Is My Shadow and How Can I Make It Known?\\" he poses \\"Seven Questions for Personal Reflection on the Shadow\\". Incidentally, the whole shadow business has been hands down the most fascinating topic for me. The subject proved the genesis of my journey into individuation and the world of Jungian psychology - a veritable gateway & goldmine!<br /><br />One theme I appreciate in several of his works is the affirmation that \\"We are all more than the sum of what happened to us.\\" that is \\"I am not what happened to me - I am what I choose to become.\\"<br /><br />There's some recurrence of certain poetry and philosophy from earlier works (e.g. \\"The Middle Passage\\") and this is certainly fine with me. To name a number of poets & philosophers he cites: James Agee, Stephen Dunn, T.S. Eliot, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Kierkegaard, D.H. Lawrence, Rainer Maria Rilke, Dylan Thomas, Thoreau, Yeats (and C.G. Jung of course).<br />Relevant footnotes throughout helpfully point the interested reader to Hollis' earlier books and they show how this material effectively evolved out of those works. Simply put, this book ties together threads from those earlier works and weaves a nice tapestry of Jungian analysis. A good bibliography and index help the reader find sources and subjects.<br /><br />The last chapter, \\"What Matters, in the End?\\" hits on aspects of our projections and requires \\"Doing Our Work\\" accepting responsibility, finding strength to pull back our projections, and a engaging in a rapport with our inner world where our choices develop. The next sub-chapter \\"Ask the Meaning of Your Suffering\\" explains how this question \\"tends to relocate our sense of selfhood beyond the narrow purview of our ego.\\" It concludes with two sub-chapters that suggest we \\"Keep Asking What Matters, in the End\\" and \\"Suffer Consciously\\" lest we take the unconscious alternative of avoiding what is in us.<br /><br />Finally, Hollis concludes: \\"...While the ultimate purpose of this journey and our unique role in the great scheme of things will remain a mystery, our questions serve us by keeping us on track. Something wants to live through us, and we need to allow it.\\"<br /><br />I was able to recognize a lot of material from this book in my life/history (as well as from my repeated listening to \\"The Middle Passage\\") and I'll undoubtedly re-read this book many times as it serves to illuminate the nature of my questions and the questions of my nature - the spirit of this is succinctly exemplified in a famous quote found in this book:<br /><br />\\"The meaning of my existence is that life has addressed a question to me . . . or conversely, I myself am a question.\\" CG Jung, MDR<br /><br />IndiAndy<br />__________________<br />We dance around in a ring and suppose.<br />But the secret sits in the middle and knows.\\" Robert Frost<br />Penetrating so many secrets, we cease to believe in the unknowable.<br />But there it sits nevertheless, calmly licking its chops.\\" H.L.

While it is meant for a serious lay-reader and undeniably non-mathematical in its presentation, this is definitely not light reading. People who aren't afraid of becoming a little lost while navigating the figurative `forest through the trees' can have courage this book will guide them if they're patient and willing to be led. To be sure, the dedicated reader will aquire a nodding acquaintance with concepts of conservation laws, symmetries, gauge theory, and U(1) X SU(2) & SU(3) group theories (which ultimately account for and lie at the root of the most fundamental physical laws) and last, but not least, a good conceptual grip of QCD. A willingness to do some re-reading will bode you well. The trip can be somewhat heavy going with its deep, abstract and technical description of a fundamentally mathematical subject - but it is well worth the wear & tear on the intellectual soles of your mind. Ultimately, this is an account of humanity's pinnacle intellectual achievement.<br /><br />OK, so what have we got here?<br /><br />TABLE OF CONTENTS<br />1 Introduction  1<br />2 Symmetry  9<br />3 The quantum world  19<br />4 Toward QCD  110<br />5 The one number of QCD  269<br />6 The gregarious gluon  288<br />7 Quarks and hadrons  305<br />8 Quarks under the microscope 328<br />9 Much ado about nothing  370<br />10 Checkerboard QCD  391<br />Appendix 1 A QCD chronology  413<br />Appendix 2 Greek alphabet & SI prefixes 426<br /><br />The introduction does its job setting the scope of subjects: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the Electro-Weak force, and last, but principally, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) a.k.a. the theory of the Strong Force. It brushes on experiments in high-energy physics that bring the constituents of the Standard Model to light.<br /><br />After the introduction, we're treated to a little history of the mathematicians and physicists who brought us Group Theory and a sketch of the properties of groups (i.e. identity element, closure, associativity & the inverse element). Descriptions and brief examples are given for O(2) orthogonal and SO(2) special orthogonal (abelian) transformations plus mention of associated dimensional 2x2 matrices; non-abelian SO(3) groups are discussed and the U(1)XSU(2) and SU(3) groups are revealed to be the fundamental abstract spaces of particle physics in a nutshell. Lie groups are briefly mentioned as well.<br /><br />The next major section, \\"The Quantum World\\", is my favorite material in this book. It starts with the fact that the measured magnetic moment anomaly of QED demonstrates its superior standing as the crown achievement of theoretical & experimental physics. Basic quantum mechanics topics are effectively covered:<br />Energy quanta (Planck's constant h), wave phase & interference, Uncertainty Principle, Schrodinger, the principle of least action and Feynman's sum over paths.<br /><br />The elements quickly evolve in relative complexity and abstraction - ultimately leading towards a clearly developed connection between QED to QCD. Theprogression takes us through:<br />mass-energy relations in Relativity, matter-antimatter pair production, Fermion and Boson spin & statistics and Pauli's Exclusion principle, quantum fields, the four-momentum, virtual particles, vacuum polarization, Green's functions, Feynman diagrams, vertex interactions, self-energy, infinite divergences, perturbation and renormalization program (dimensional regularization), effective low-energy field theory, Fermi's theory of weak interactions to Weinberg/Glashow/Salam and Veltman/t'Hooft Nobel prize winning contributions in the electroweak realm, and finally the all important gauge principle including the example of changes in potentials and changes in global vs. local phase.<br /><br />I'm now going to do the author a grave disservice by reviewing the remainder of the book in an all too brief summarization. The majority of the book plumbs the depths of QCD. Andrew brings us by the experimental facilities for a thorough inspection of the accelerators & detectors (BNL RHIC, Fermilab CDF, CERN-LEP, DESY, KEK-BELLE & SLAC). He gives complete coverage of the physicists responsible for its development and associated milestones. To name just a few of the many discussed in great detail: Yukawa - Isospin, mesons; Yang-Mills - CP violation, Gell-Man - the Eightfold Way; `the particle zoo', families, Quark-Gluon, flavordynamics, inelastic scattering, color charges; Nambu - spontaneous symmetry breaking; the Higgs mechanism & weak neutral currents; Gross, Wilczek & Politzer - Asymptotic Freedom.<br /><br />Watson judiciously included countless diagrams to illustrate important concepts and fundamental interactions plus many photographic pictures of physicists, experimental devices and facilities. The back of the book includes a good glossary and a nice annotated \\"Further reading\\" section that breaks suggested titles in easy reading, not-so-easy reading, and `hard core' sections.<br /><br />That's it. Altogether a serious undertaking - I hope you are challenged by it and thoroughly enjoy it as much as I have!<br /><br />p.s. I recommend these complementary books: \\"Deep Down Things\\" by Schumm; \\"The Force of Symmetry\\" by Icke; \\"Fearful Symmetry\\" by Zee; \\"Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe\\" by Lederman; and \\"Out of This World\\" by Webb.

US	46871101	R26QDQVYHQJXU9	080187971X	390760583	Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics	Books	5	259	264	N	N	This Book is Released & Available for Purchase	I had the opportunity to read this book as a longstanding draft before it went into publication (then titled \\"Patterns and Paradigms\\"). Shortly afterwards, I opened what turned out to be enjoyable correspondence with the author. He surprised me with the news that this book was recently released and ready for purchase through the publishers. I since then bought the published edition and this review represents an analysis of the released hardback. The fact that the author took more than four years to write and polish this fine book for the general public shows in its tight, cogent and succinct style and content.<br /><br />Deep Down Things (the Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics) gets its title from a beautiful verse in Gerard Manley Hopkins fitting poem God's Grandeur \\"And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things\\"<br /><br />In the Preface the author explains that the title is meant to convey that \\"Deep down within the atomic nucleus, deeply within the paradoxical richness of empty space, deep inside the synapses of the great scientific thinkers of the 20th century - this is the territory of particle physics.\\" This book peals back the layers of the atomic and sub-atomic world like an onion ready for investigation. Just for fun, look for the rest of the poem on the Internet.<br /><br />Schumm says in the Introduction that his book \\"...represents my attempts to elucidate the currently accepted theory of particle physics...for the interested public.\\"  He goes on to say that it's not \\"...a story about the history of particle physics or of the lives of its protagonists. Nor is it a book of anecdotes about the culture and society...\\"<br />Deep Down is categorically non-mathematical and in the spirit of the \\"popular\\" vein but with an unusual twist. This is not a superficial pop-science \\"gee-wiz\\" book. At the risk of losing some less than serious lay readers, Schumm has wisely sprinkled some important formulas throughout the book and he effectively shows why they are significant. You don't have to be able to see or do the \\"proofs\\" in the equations, just the important concepts behind them. Chapter 1 serves as the Introduction and Chapter 2 is a quick account of the four fundamental forces of Nature as by described by the Standard Model. Chapter 3 covers Planck's constant and the revolutionary discovery of quantization, Einstein's Relativity, Wave-Particle Duality (ala de Broglie's matter waves), Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle, and finally Schrodinger's time-independent equation are all brought to light. The book has many diagrams to graphically illustrate various concepts and also a nice Notes section to elaborate on technical details. Chapter 4 \\"The marriage of Relativity & Quantum Theory\\" (one of my favorite chapters) is all about Relativistic QFT, Feynman diagrams of fundamental interactions, bosons, antimatter, spin, the virtually active vacuum (Casimir's effect) and ends with a nice treatment of QED. Chapter 5 is about the fundamental building blocks known as the Standard Model: Quarks, Leptons, Bosons, and Fermions & the \\"particle zoo\\".<br /><br />The remaining half of the book (chapters 6 though 10) is my favorite. Here Schumm takes me where I've always wanted to go - right into the heart & depth of the symmetries & abstractions that have only been hinted at in other books. Here, Schumm offers a serious & stimulating challenge for this physics lay-enthusiast. I'm happily compelled to re-read major sections of the book that are indeed deep & abstract - trying to get my mind wrapped around the concepts of SU(2) & SU(3) Lie Algebras, hypercharge, and internal symmetry spaces in gauge theories. I've seen this stuff before in many other popular books but they're usually dumbed down too far with vague or loose analogies (I can't help but feel like some authors are being forced to be less than forthcoming). Some of us don't flee in a blind/frightened panic over alien & abstract mathematical concepts of internal spaces so long as we're not hit with the double barrel of imposing mathematical rigor & proof. You see, I strongly suspect that the majority of popular physics readers are simply interested in sensationalized subjects like Superstring & Theory of Everything stuff - this is what sells in the minds of most publishers after all. So, I appreciate the (too) few authors & publishers that go out on a limb for those of us who're starving for real meat (less the Graduate level rigor however). Incidentally take a peek at Vincint Icke's book: The Force of Symmetry. You'll see a unique approach to fascinating and abstract world of fundamental physics there as well.<br /><br />One can't help but suspect that there's something to the exquisitely beautiful patterns in the abstract mathematical spaces and Lie groups the author is trying to teach us here. Correspondence between rotation groups in two real dimensions R(2) and those in the complex plane U(1) are presented accessibly. He brings us through Lie Algebras: R(3), U(1), SU(2), & SU(3) and Gauge Theories; spin projections, complex rotations (imaginary numbers) and symmetry transformation operations in Isospin space.<br /><br />I love this stuff and only wish I had cultivated a discipline of mathematical studies as a young man so that I could fully appreciate the beauty and utility of these methods of understanding the crown achievement of human intellect. In any event, I believe Deep Down Things is written with someone like me in mind (the author agrees) and I hope you find your interest in it as well.hematical concepts of internal spaces so long as we're not hit with the double barrel of imposing mathematical rigor & proof.

Out of this World - Colliding Universes, Branes and other Wild Ideas of Modern Physics by Stephen Webb is a humble exercise in reminding one not to judge a book by its cover.<br />I was surprised by the difference between my initial judgment (by its title & cartoonish cover) and my evolving sense of appreciation for the depth & thoroughness this author brings to a general lay-audience. Stephen Webb provides a clear & accessible introduction to the most important subjects in fundamental physics while bridging the gulf between \\"gee wiz\\" popular science books (e.g. \\"Fabric of the Cosmos\\") and the deeper, more technical treatments that top out at the Undergraduate and Graduate level. Keep in mind this book is, strictly speaking, categorically qualitative (i.e. non-mathematical). The 11 chapters are subdivided into succinct & digestible sections with generous figures, tables and photographs (145 total) illustrating concepts of physical processes and the key physicists involved. A 14 page Glossary, 2 page Bibliography, and a fairly thorough 6 page index close out the book.<br />  The scope of this book is grand in its broad range of subjects is covered in a concise no-nonsense, no-holds barred language. Group Theory & Gauge Symmetries, Special & General Relativity, Quantum Theory, the Standard Model of particle physics, Quantum Field Theories (Electroweak (QED) & Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Big Bang cosmology, and a fairly comprehensive coverage of Grand Unified Theories (GUTS), Supersymmetry (SUSY), Superstrings and M-Theory. All these subjects are put into proper historical context placing appropriate credit to the key physicists.<br />  After an introductory chapter, Webb leads us through a profundity of symmetry principles in chapter 1: continuous & discrete symmetries, spatial & temporal translations, Noether's Theorem (symmetry & conservation laws: time-energy, rotation-angular momentum), mirror & parity symmetry, Lorentz transformations/invariance principles. The chapter concludes with a rather nice qualitative treatment on mathematical groups - introducing the reader to Special Orthogonal/Unitary (SO(N), U(1) & SU(N)) and exceptional Lie groups and their importance to symmetries in fundamental physics.<br />  In chapter 2, the author crafts a beautiful real-world example of a practical application of both physics on a large scale (General & Special Relativity) and small scale (Quantum Mechanics: Planck scales, the Uncertainty principle and virtual interactions) by discussing how these \\"Twin Pillars of Physics\\" make the Global Positioning System possible.<br />  Chapters 3 & 4 are my favorites. They quickly bring you through the way high energy physics produces and classifies the constituents of our Standard Model. The key concepts of units of energy, rest mass, Electric charge and spin; Fermions & Bosons, leptons, and the Quark model of Hadrons are fleshed out for our edification. Also, a fascinating aside reminds us that the World-Wide Web was created at the CERN accelerator facility in Europe and foretells of the next generation \\"Grid\\" global network system. Local Gauge Symmetry, Dirac field, QED, Feynman diagrams, perturbation & renormalization programs; the Strong interactions of SU(3)c Quark-Gluon, & color and the SU(2) X U(1) Electroweak plus Higgs unification close out chapter 4 with a nice ring. Chapter 5 is a quick but inclusive read where the fruits & faults of SU(5) GUTS and N=8 SUSY are aired out.<br />  The early history of extra dimensions (1919 Kaluza-1926 Klein) and Edward Witten's 1981 eleven dimensional compact manifold paper are introduced in chapter 6. Chapter 7 brings us through the meat of Superstring Theories proper where Veneziano, Nambu, Susskind; Schwarz & Scherk; Calabi-Yau, Green, Witten, and Gross, Harvey, Martinec & Rohm (\\"Princeton String Quartet\\") are given due credit in the development of the Theory. Loop Quantum Gravity shows up in a one-page aside. The five types of consistent SuperstringTheories are spelled out towards the end of the chapter.<br />  Chapter 8 is titled \\"The Story of M\\". Here, Webb covers electromagnetic duality, monopoles & superconductors (`t Hooft, et. al), QCD again, heterotic SO(32), s and t duality and finally M-Theory itself. As with the rest of the book (and In the spirit of true scientific practice), the author includes both good arguments for and general criticisms against these theories. These pros & cons are given fair \\"air-time\\". D-BRANES and Black Holes are added to the mix in Chapter 9. Chapter 10 is a brisk cruise through the \\"Holographic Universe\\" principle via anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS), Conformal field (CFT) and large-N theories.<br />  The closing chapter (11) is a great synthesis & synopsis of some earlier travels through the lands of Quantum Fields, the Standard model of particle physics, symmetries & symmetry breaking; gravity waves & missing matter; extra dimensions, Strings, \\"Brane worlds\\", the Anthropic Principle, and \\"coming attractions\\" in high energy physics (HEP)...<br />  All in all, this book is a substantial complement to my extensive library of physics multimedia. \\"Out of this World\\" undeniably meets my expectation for a great author to bridge the yawning gap we autodidacts crave to step across between purely pop-science to academic textbooks in the subject. I have to recommend this book to all seriously interested physics laymen who want a bigger & better picture of the way we humans strive to understand how the Universe ultimately works...<br />I'll read it several times and eventually pass my copy around when all this knowledge gestates & gels in my mind.

In a few words it is about &quot;Nothingness&quot; or the vacuum or &quot;Void&quot;, cosmology and the fate of our Universe. What is the Void? It may surprise you to find out that physicists unilaterally agree that, in a strict sense, there is no such thing as nothing anywhere in our Universe. What is the nature of the apparent emptiness between particles of matter and the space between galaxies? The answer - Fields. These fields are the ubiquitous, ephemeral, and evanescent Higgs, Gravitational, Electromagnetic (QED), (electro) Weak, and Strong (QCD - color). This answer is obviously incomplete. QFT may be penultimate to an absolutely fundamental M-theory. In an additional sense, I think it's fair to say that Patterns is a study of one humble astronomer's experience, observations, and search for meaning in and of the physics of Spacetime & Gravity, the Vacuum, and the physics of Fields. It is a search you can comfortably ride along with - sharing in the exploration, gaining ontological handles for carry-on technical concepts. Here's a quick look at the Table of Contents:<br /><br /> Prolog<br /> Acknowledgements<br /> 1. The Dark Constellations<br /> Why We Fear the Dark<br /> 2. The Spirits Within<br /> Invisible Fields and Ethers<br /> 3. Blind Spots<br /> Quantum Fields and the Physical Vacuum<br /> 4. Patterns in the Void<br /> Vacuum Energy and Hidden Fields<br /> 5.

The Sundered Worlds<br /> The Creation of the Universe<br /> Epilog<br /> Glossary<br /> Bibliography<br /> Index<br /><br /> Well, how does `Patterns in he Void' read? `Patterns' isn't the usual gee-wiz historical chronology or rundown of concepts and theoretical breakthroughs made by the respective physicists. Dr. Odenwald uses accessibly technical language tempered in confidential, sincere and conversational prose - addressing deep issues & questions that you and I, as mere mortals in spectator physics, might seek meaningful answers for. He is personal, warm, candid and forthcoming - even in his chapter that tackles the stark outlook for the ultimate fate of humanity and the seemingly inevitable heat death of Universe. Be prepared, some chapters have a bit of foreboding and melancholy. I can't help but feel as if this is the story of how the author faced his fears and came to final acceptance of the honest scientific facts regarding the ultimate demise of Life and the Universe.<br /> Sten uses a refreshing approach in the beginning of each chapter giving occasional real-life stories that lend warmth, meaningful context and impetus for further reading - welcoming one to move forward without trepidation. For example, he reminisces about star parties with like-minded friends of his youth - earnest and eager in their amateur astronomical attempts to grasp the big picture of cosmology. He also shares some of his later outings and adventures in the rugged backcountry wilderness where strange and ominous events brought his mind to the precipice of epistemology. These often tie-in with issues of mind & matter - consciousness, brain perception, and physical observation with regards to theoretical physics. To be sure, this is not the titillated/fluffy & tangential speculation of the paradox in measurement, uncertainty, and quantum conundrums one sees in much of todays popular quantum physics publications. You can find these philosophical treatments in just about every other book.<br /><br /> Early in the book, a seashore tide pool is used as an exquisite metaphor for discovery. Eloquent analogies abound throughout the text. Quantum Fields, Superstring, Supersymmetry, and M-Theories are wonderfully elucidated in later chapters. The beauty and power of physical theories and, to a very limited extent, the mathematics used in their description is shared in accessible language. On an incidental note, I perceived subtle hints of something strange early in this book. It almost seems as if, while on one hand, the idea of the &quot;Ether&quot; has been successfully dismissed in physics, on the other modern physical theorists have evolved the ether into sophisticated quantum fields.<br /> The center of the book contains a series of 12 glossy-colored plates spread across 8 pages. These include gorgeous imagery from Scanning-Tunneling Microscopes and supercomputer simulations of atomic and other sub-microscopic images along with intricate fractals and uncanny Galactic Super clusters. Spectacular photos brought to you by the Hubble Space Telescope add to the repertoire of magnificent art in these plates.<br /><br /> The Glossary uses in 5 pages to describe 9 major terms that are thematic elements throughout the text. They are: Dimension, Field, Hyperspace, Nothingness, Quantum, Space, Space-Time, and Vacuum.<br /> The bibliography is a bounty of books, articles, and references used in the development of the text. I strongly encourage you to mine this section for seminal sources to further your pursuits.<br /><br /> This review comes after my second reading and I eagerly anticipate my third, fourth and fifth readings. But why stop there? Because of his creative style and delivery, it was easy to connect to Sten's fascination with the great mysteries of the infinite heavens and the infinitesimal fabric of reality. I related with his desire and intent of writing a book that comprehensively pieces together diverse threads into an artful masterpiece. A few last words to describe this wonderful work: `Patterns' is beautifully written, thoroughly objective, cogent, technically concise, conceptually accessible, and gives a succinct yet coherent discourse of the deepest, most fundamental aspects of physics. I think Patterns is a fitting landmark in the broader path the aspiring autodidact chooses to follow.

Newton offers intellectually satisfying handles for what I like to call 'carry-on concepts' in modern physical theories.<br />This book is what some would call popular physics but I think is broader and deeper than such a simple categorization. From the outset of 'Thinking about Physics' (TaP), Newton offers that answers to issues in thinking about questions of physics are subject to debate and humbly advises us not to accept his word without question. He doesn't lie out the solutions offered over the years, with all the pros and cons (and yet he ultimately gives his 2 cents), but suggests we use his arguments as starting points for our own thinking.<br />I found a good overall summary in the beginning of this work: ?This book consists of more or less independent essays on various general topics found in physics, whose common thread appears in the pervasiveness of probabilistic approaches and the central role played by mathematics, with the quantum theory of fields as the most basic description of reality.?<br />In the Preface Newton admits a '...disagreement with a number of prominent physicists such as Feynman & Heisenberg, who, at the most fundamental level, give primacy to the particle concept.'<br />As in Philip R. Wallace's Paradox Lost, Newton makes the argument that the supposed paradoxes in interpretations of theoretical conceptions of physical phenomenon have a '...linguistic source, stemming from the use of the concept of particles and waves.' In contrast to Paradox Lost, he regards quantum fields '...as the basic entity, with 'particles'-possessing great intuitive appeal but circumscribed utility-appearing as phenomena produced by the field.'<br />His Introduction and Chapter 1-Theories can be seen as a condensed version of his book 'The Truth of Science' and, at the same time, an expansion of a great layman's treatment in similar chapters of his title 'What Makes Nature Tick?' (WMNT) The latter book is a less mathematically technical, more popular look at subjects conspicuously similar to TaP. It is in these two chapters where he addresses some challenges to a popular and historical philosophy of science. As an antidote to philosophical general assumptions, loose arguments and possible misinterpretations apparent in other popular publications, Newton places common sense definitions of experiments, theoretical understanding and explanation on solid ontological ground leaving us with a sense of complete logical satisfaction. He also discusses the necessity and great utility of using conceptual analogies in describing certain phenomenon in physical theory but makes the usual warnings of their limits and potential misleading.<br />The second chapter talks about the state of physical systems and phase correlations in classical & quantum mechanics. The state vector, density operator, and probabilities are nicely brought to light.<br />Chapter 3 is a sweet treatment of the role, beauty and & power of mathematics. This is an elegant and technical expansion of the chapter in ?What Makes Nature Tick?? (WMNT)<br />Chapter 4, Quantum Fields and Particles, is fairly technical but accessible with the persistent enthusiasm of this physics layman. I return time and again to this chapter to gain understanding of aspects for which I had ignorance in previous readings.<br />In Symmetry in Physics (ch5) Newton takes us through Parity, Group Theory in Particle Physics, and Field Theory. I chose to prepare for this chapter by reading the lighter chapter on Symmetry in WMNT. Yet another example of the nice complementary correlation between the two works.<br />The last three chapters are Causality and Probability, Quantum Mechanics and Reality, and Arrows of Time. These titles are sufficiently self-explanatory for the purposes of this review and exist as final examples of the technical expansion that may be explored inthe corresponding chapters of WMNT.<br />The book concludes with an Epilog where the author asks whether we are able to distinguish relevant characteristics of our perception of physical nature and summarizes the three broad essentials this book was meant to identify: quantum fields and the explanatory machinery which provide the necessarily mathematical language to describe nature unambiguously - causality and probability.<br />The Further Reading section in the rear of the book is nicely broken down by the corresponding chapters with the suggested reading listed in the usual manner. A great resource! Finally, a complete bibliography and helpful index conclude the book. Last and certainly least, I ran across strange sentence early in my reading of TaP, '...it would take a very large hole in the side of a well-constructed skyscraper to make the building collapse.' The book was written in January 2000. Being serious about physics, I obviously don?t attribute this to conspiracy but do find the coincidence uncanny.<br />BOTTOM LINE ON THE BOOK ?

I bought this Dover book because I trusted Dover publications and am now disappointed to say that this trust is now in question. The book has some merit: the flow and examples are clear and well laid out however, THERE ARE NO SOLUTIONS TO THE EXERCISES!<br />Be aware that there are some glaring mistakes even to the beginner's eyes. For example, the author says &quot;We may determine a 4X4 matrix...&quot; and then represents this 4x4 with a 5x5 matrix. And he contradicts a commutivity theorem by saying that where two matrices A and zero share the same nxn row &amp; column dimensions An+0n=A and then right after this he says A+0=0 on pp. 12-13. This is wrong! How am I supposed to trust further examples from this book? Sorry, I'll have to permanently shelve it...<br />Good luck.<br />IndiAndy<br />Aspiring Autodidact	2003-03-17

I discovered that the narrated unabridged (7 cassettes) book on tape is available after I read the printed book cover to cover. I quickly bought a copy & have since listened it more times than I can recall! The narrator's voice is pleasant to listen to. His voice come across clear, brisk & very articulate. The whole wonderful experience keeps my attention riveted & gratefully takes my mind off the infamous Southern California traffic during my hours long commute each day. There's always something different & interesting that captivates my attention each time I experience this great book. Keep in mind that I'm a veritable compulsive-obsessive autodidactic with a fanatical drive to understand physical reality at the most fundamental level - call me a PRE (Physical Reality Explorer). I don't have a formal \\"higher\\" education or the mathematical tools to speak the technical language - but, like I said, I'm a fanatical layman who's bent on understanding what the hell is REALLY going on \\"out there\\" - or \\"in there\\" as the case may be...<br />Well, back to the book! You don't really need a deep understanding of mathematics or even an understanding of Quantum Physics to \\"get\\" what this book has to offer. Shoot, for that matter, maybe having an \\"empty cup\\" would make the experience of this book all the better! So, what's in the book? Glad you asked! Here's a brief table of contents with a few (parenthetical) comments:<br />· Preface<br />· Prologue<br />· On a Piece of Chalk (great introduction to some basic principles in Atomic Theory)<br />· Two Cheers for Reductionism (\\"...I am not an uncompromising reductionist, I'm a compromising reductionist!\\")<br />· Quantum Mechanics & Its Discontents<br />· Tales of Theory & Experiment (this has a nice history & synopsis of QED)<br />· Beautiful Theories<br />· Against Philosophy<br />· Twentieth Century Blues<br />· The Shape of a Final Theory<br />· Facing Finality<br />· What About God? (he admits that he's not a qualified Theologian here)<br />· Down in Ellis County<br />· Afterword (this might be titled something else like \\"...A Year Later...\\")<br />The book on tape doesn't have the Preface or the Afterword, but don't let that stop you from getting a copy 'cause you won't miss anything really important in those sections.<br />I liked Weinberg's description of the way the chain of questions \\"Why?\\" have arrows of explanation ever convergent towards ubiquitous laws of fundamental physics. It seems analogous to Faraday's lines of force in the fields he described. I see a metaphor here where the \\"field\\" of the \\"arrows of explanation\\" points in the direction of propagation towards answers to questions about the most fundamental aspects of physical reality. Weinberg's cutting logic & objective appraisal is cogently brought to bear on deep questions such as:<br />What roles do quantum theories & symmetry principles in physics play in the search for a Final Theory?<br />Why does each explanation of the way nature works point to other, deeper explanations?<br />What implications will a final theory have for our philosophy & religious faith?<br />What would be the role of God in a universe governed by such a theory?<br />Why are the best theories not only logical but beautiful?<br />What do physicists mean by a final theory?<br />What sort of things might such a theory say?<br />How could we tell it is indeed final?<br />How close are we to one?<br />As you can see, this book shares a curiosity with the audience. We get keen insight into Weinberg's working philosophy when he describes himself as a \\"rough & ready realist\\" & a \\"compromising reductionist\\" while he subtly & carefully defends his right to DO physics without being bothered by those fluffy, subjective, & interpretive philosophies which, you get the distinct impression, he'd like to just go away& leave him alone...<br />Finally, I am compelled to urge you to look at two other works by Weinberg which are actually the same material, just different media. These are a pair of lectures presented by Steven Weinberg & the late great Richard Feynman in the 1986 Memorial Lectures given in honor of the great P.A.M. Dirac. I bought the video, \\"Towards the Final Laws of Physics: The 1986 Dirac Memorial Lecture\\" and, to my great joy, found a coupled experience of Weinberg giving a slightly more technical & narrowly focused lecture in VHS video format. The title of the printed book (transcribed from the video taped lectures) is, \\"Elementary Particles & the Laws of Physics: The 1986 Dirac Memorial Lectures\\". These two media really compliment \\"Dreams of a Final Theory\\".<br />Bottom line on \\"Dreams\\": accessible, cogent, succinct & beautifully written.<br /><br />...lone...<br />Finally, I am compelled to urge you to look at two other works by Weinberg which are actually the same material, just different media.

Audio Vol. 15 Feynman on Electricity & Magnetism	THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE RECORDED AUDIO LECTURES ON TAPE. IT IS A REVIEW OF AUDIO VOLUME FIFTEEN - NOT ANY OTHER VOLUME AND NOT THE \\"FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS\\" BOOK DESPITE AMAZON'S PLACEMENT OF THIS REVIEW ON THE PRINTED BOOK WEB PAGE. (the system also seems to miss-associate these reviews with the incorrect audio volumes.)<br />This volume is part two of \\"Feynman on Electricity & Magnetism\\" - Volume 14 is part one.<br /><br />OK, that warning aside, the subject is Electricity & Magnetism. The man is Feynman. Here's what you get:<br />Six hours of Feynman lecturing (in his characteristic idiosyncratic demeanor) to students at the California Institute of Technology during the early years of the 1960's. Yes folks, that's right: Six 1 hour lectures on six audio tapes covering the chapters 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, & 14 from which volume two of the printed lectures was transcribed. The lectures also cover some serious mathematics (Differential & Vector Calculus). This is where owning a copy of the printed lectures is necessary for following his use of the massive University lecture hall chalkboards. Of course Professor Feynman makes use of the chalkboard which you won't have the advantage of seeing but you could keep a copy of the printed lectures on hand (separate purchase) to get whatever visuals you need from the transcribed illustrated diagrams which were published (I do this and it's handy). The only audio editing is from the publisher announcing the date, lecture title, and where each chapter subsection begins. It is interesting to hear the background noise of the students as they file in and out of the lecture hall and towards the end of each lecture. You also hear bells in the hallway signaling the end of the class or possibly the lunch break.

US	46871101	RG4KXN07EGYL7	0738205311	839906274	The Feynman Lectures on Physics: The Complete Audio Collection: Volume 14: Feynman on Electricity and Magnetism, Part 1	Books	4	29	29	N	N	Audio Volume #14 Feynman on Electricity & Magnetism PART ONE	THIS REVIEW IS FOR VOLUME 14 OF THE RECORDED AUDIO LECTURES ON TAPE - NOT THE \\"FEYNMAN LECTURES ON PHYSICS\\" BOOK AND NOT ANY OTHER AUDIO VOLUME DESPITE AMAZON'S PLACEMENT OF THIS REVIEW ON THE WRONG VOLUME PAGE. (the system also seems to miss-associate these reviews with the incorrect audio volumes.) THIS IS PART ONE OF TWO VOLUMES ON ELECTRICITY & MAGNETISM - VOLUME #15 IS PART TWO.<br /><br />OK, that warning aside, the subject is Electrodynamics. The man is Feynman. Here's what you get:<br />Six hours of Feynman lecturing (in his characteristic idiosyncratic demeanor) to students at the California Institute of Technology during the early years of the 1960's. Yes folks, that's right: Six 1 hour lectures on six audio tapes covering the first six contiguous chapters from which volume two of the printed lectures was transcribed. The lectures also cover some serious mathematics (Differential & Vector Calculus). This is where owning a copy of the printed lectures comes in handy for following the lecture from his transcribed use of the massive University lecture hall chalk-boards. The only audio editing is from the publisher announcing the date, lecture title, and where each chapter subsection begins. It is interesting to hear the background noise of the students as they file in and out of the lecture hall and towards the end of each lecture. You also hear bells in the hallway signaling the end of the class or possibly the lunch break. The students enthusiastically demonstrate their appreciation of Professor Feynman's efforts by applauding him at the end of each lecture. Of course Professor Feynman makes use of the chalkboard which you wont have the advantage of seeing but you could keep a copy of the printed lectures on hand (separate purchase) to get whatever visuals you need from the transcribed illustrated diagrams which were published (I have done this and it's handy). Mostly I just listen to these tapes (I have a collection of over 72 taped lectures) on my one hour a day commute each day, over and over again. It's like I'm always in school with the great genius of Feynman every day!<br />This audio volume (#14) is Part 1 of 2. The next six contiguous lectures will be available in audio volume #15. By the way, I wrote the publisher (Perseus Books Group) and asked them when Part 2 would be available to which they promptly sent the helpful reply:<br />'Volumes 15 and 16 of the Audio Collection will be coming out this spring. Volume 15 (Feynman on Electricity and Magnetism, Part 2) contains sections on electrostatic energy, electricity in the atmosphere-including lightning and thunderstorms-magnetostatics, and the magnetic field. Volume 16 (Feynman on Electromagnetism) discusses the vector potential, laws of induction, and the Maxwell equations. According to our production schedule, both volumes should be available by April.'<br />Well anyhow, I thought that you'd like to see how these audio lectures correlate to the printed 'Lectures on Physics' by audiocassette to volume & chapter for each book:<br />Tape #1 is from the printed lectures Vol. II Chapter 1: ELECTROMAGNETISM (Sept. 27, 1962)<br />1.1 Electrical forces<br />1.2 Electric and Magnetic fields<br />1.3 Characterizations of vector fields<br />1.4 The laws of electromagnetism<br />1.5 What are fields?<br />1.6 Electromagnetism in science and technology<br />Tape #2 is from the printed lectures Vol. II Chapter 2: DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS OF VECTOR FIELDS (Oct. 1, 1962)<br />2.1 Understanding physics<br />2.2 Scalar and vector fields - T and h<br />2.3 Derivatives of fields - the gradient<br />2.4 The operator del<br />2.5 Operators with del<br />2.6 The differential equation of heat flow<br />2.7 Second derivatives of vector fields<br />2.8 Pitfalls<br />Tape #3 is from the printed lectures Vol. II Chapter 3: VECTOR INTEGRAL CALCULUS (Oct. 4, 1962)<br />3.1 Vector integrals; the line integral of del Y<br />3.2 The flux of a vector field<br />3.3 The flux from a cube; Gauss'theorem<br />3.4 Heat conduction; the diffusion equation<br />3.5 The circulation of a vector field<br />3.6 The circulation around a square; Stokes's theorem<br />3.7 Curl-free and divergence-free fields<br />3.8 Summary<br />Tape #4 is from the printed lectures Vol. II Chapter 4: ELECTROSTATICS (Oct. 8, 1962)<br />4.1 Statics<br />4.2 Coulomb's law; superposition<br />4.3 Electric potential<br />4.4 E=-del f<br />4.5 The flux of E<br />4.6 Gauss' law; divergence of E<br />4.7 Field of a sphere of charge<br />4.8 Field lines; equipotential surfaces<br />Tape #5 is from the printed lectures Vol. II Chapter 5: APPLICATION OF GAUSS' LAW (Oct. 11, 1962)<br />5.1 Electrostatics is Gauss' law plus...<br />5.2 Equilibrium in an electrostatic field<br />5.3 Equilibrium with conductors<br />5.4 Stability of atoms<br />5.5 The field of a line charge<br />5.6 A sheet of charge; a spherical shell<br />5.7 A sphere of charge; a spherical shell<br />5.8 Is the field of a point charge exactly 1/r^2<br />5.9 The fields of a conductor<br />5.10 The field in a cavity of a conductor<br />Tape #6 is from the printed lectures Vol. II Chapter 6: THE ELECTRIC FIELD IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES (Oct. 15, 1962)<br />6.1 Equations of the electrostatic potential<br />6.2 The electric dipole<br />6.3 Remarks on vector equations<br />6.4 The dipole potential as a gradient<br />6.5 The dipole approximation for an arbitrary distribution<br />6.6 The fields of charged conductors<br />6.7 The method of images<br />6.8 A point charge near a conducting plate<br />6.9 A point charge near a conducting sphere<br />6.10 Condensers: parallel plates<br />6.11 High-voltage breakdown<br />(...) check out my other Feynman reviews & \\"Listmania Lists\\".

US	46871101	R2B4DLZ9V8EBSZ	1573928593	565108489	Timeless Reality : Symmetry, Simplicity, and Multiple Universes	Books	4	63	77	N	N	Would have five stars if he stuck to one thesis objective...	I approve of the non-mathematical descriptions this book offers the intended audience. It elucidates some important quantitative principles in a comprehensible language (e.g. the Principle of Least Action; the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian; the 'Wave-Particle Duality' and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle; state vectors, phase, superposition, Gauge Invariance, Relativity symmetry, spin, and Lorentz transformations). I have enjoyed using this book as part of a bridge to step across the yawning gulf between popular (non-mathematical) and rigorously quantitative textbooks on Quantum theory (Quantum Electrodynamics & Quantum Field Theory). I especially liked Chapter 7 'Taming Infinity' where the Feynman-Wheeler Interaction Theory and Feynman's QED are beautifully presented for intellectual consumption. He seems especially aligned with Feynman's views of the particle nature of matter.<br />The author has carefully placed key words in bold type throughout the book that indicate their inclusion in a generous glossary of terms near the end of the book. I have grown to appreciate this as is a valuable feature in several books at this reading level. The chapters are broken into intellectually digestible size with a fair amount of diagrams to illustrate certain concepts visually.<br />Apparently a part of his agenda in this book, as well as in several of his other publications, is to try to correct (control) superstitious creationist (wrong) thinking concerning the origin of our Universe and equally incorrect mystical interpretations of reality. Vic flat out states that the Universe '...had no beginning and was not created.' For example, Dr. Stenger seems compelled to narrowly target the logic of theistic physicists such as Polkinghorne and Ross. In addition, he seems to be inclined to marginalize the fact that particles are a manifestation of force field excitations/waves in a quantum field description of the phenomena in our Universe. After carefully reading his book (with sincere & open-minded interest) I have come to strongly suspect that he fears an association of 'spooky action at a distance' (i.e. fields & waves) with a an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, and eternal (timeless) Supreme Being who, God forbid, might have created everything (including the laws of physics). He also goes after the philosophical interpretation of QM that speculates that reality is mystically created or changed by observation & measurement. One has to wonder if maybe the author might have had some kind of traumatic religious disenchantment in his earlier travels through life that subsequently motivates him to prove that God doesn't exist. I would like to point out that I once had a bout of serious religious disillusionment from which I recovered to a simple & humble attitude and outlook towards a theological ontology of reality that is in harmony with, indeed even embraces, physical reality as we understand it from a scientific perspective. It's possible to do this and not risk your intelligence, reasonability, sanity, and objectivity towards reality. I may be projecting something that isn't really there with this guy so I apologize if that's the case. Honestly I have to confess that I don't know (for sure) what motivates this man as I cannot read his mind. I can, however, surmise from what he has written that he finds the possibility of a spiritual realm untenable. Well, live & let live right?<br />It must be noted that one of his major points in this book is we exist in a (bi-directional) time symmetric Universe that may be one of many in the 'Multiverse'. This is most interesting and would make a book in itself without all the other anti-superstitious stuff. I believe that he could have left his arguments against the creative design of the Universe in (a revised version of?) his other book 'The Unconscious Quantum' to keep this particular book more focused towards the subjects of the sub-title: 'Symmetry, Simplicity, and Multiple Universes'. Ironically, his arguments for a timeless reality reinforce my view of an eternal Spirit whom I believe is responsible for, and continues to sustain, more than we can ever achieve in defining the reality he has created. I choose to call this Spirit God. Well now you know my perspective. I like to try to keep an open mind. If I'm wrong, and I very well might be, then I haven't lost anything, just a little mental time in a timeless universe.<br />All this said I hope you don't get the wrong impression of my respect towards what Mr. Stenger has done with this great book. He has challenged us to be freethinking skeptics and to recognize the hocus-pocus philosophical fluff that is frequently published in the mystical/speculative interpretations concerning the nature of reality at the quantum level. I loved the book because the majority of it lent itself as a great reference to introductory Quantum Mechanics. His writing is succinct (no fluff), objective and didactic. I recommend \\"Timeless Reality\\" to anyone (theistic or otherwise) interested in exploring the deeply mysterious and equally edifying adventure of Quantum Reality. I hope this comes out in paperback so that more can benefit from it as I have. My sincere appreciation goes out to this author.

This book makes for a great introduction of particles &amp; fields for the layman who is inclined to take on a book which surpasses the completely qualitative &amp; popular (non-technical/historical) books that one can easily find at your local bookstore. I should clarify that this book might be seen as somewhat more than an easy introduction by the kind of reader who enjoys reading, for example, Paul Davies, John Gribbon, Steven Hawking, and Michio Kaku's popular expositions on science (physics &amp; cosmology). From a popular science reader's perspective it could said that this book has a technical element to it in that the mathematics are present however I believe they are at an approachable level (i.e. there are no daunting calculus derivatives, integrals or other scary looking formulas). Here, let's have the author speak for himself from the preface:<br /><br />&quot;In this book I have tried to present those basic concepts of particles and fields and of space and time, as illustrated by modern physics, very much as a professional physicist understands them. I believe that these concepts are accessible to the nonprofessional - that which I can't explain to an interested layman, I must not understand properly myself. Which is not to say the ideas are so trivial that they can be understood by physicists or layman with the &quot;attentive mind&quot;...<br />The text is nonmathematical, though on occasion simple relations are expressed in algebraic forms that should be known to anyone with a high-school education. Some more complex relations that seem to be especially interesting are presented in the extensive set of footnotes. Though few of these require mathematical sophistication beyond that taught in the first few weeks of a high-school algebra course, mathematical simplicity does not translate into conceptual simplicity, and these presentations often require careful and time-consuming thought. Once written, a book has a life of it's own independent of the author's control; however I suggest that the mathematical footnotes be samples rather than consumed. There are those who can &quot;read&quot; mathematics like a novel, but for most of us so compact an information transfer cannot be assimilated easily and the time required to penetrate the arguments interrupts the narrative flow excessively.&quot;<br /><br />Some of the nice features of &quot;The Great Design&quot; include plenty of intuitive examples, illustrated figures (with some decent Feynman Diagrams), important graphs and tables. I always enjoy when an author includes famous quotes at the chapter headings as Dr. Adair does. I think that you can see into the author's mind just a little more. As promised in the authors preface I quoted above, there are a generous amount of end of chapter notes referenced throughout the main text by number. Many of these offer slightly more rigorous (and technical) mathematical elucidation of the subject or just a deeper peek at the heart of the matter. So, if you are a layman like myself, I would warn you that this book might pose a challenge but a rewarding challenge nonetheless. Based on my experience with other books I have to say that a glossary would have been nice in this book but I did without.<br />Finally, I thought you might like a peek at the Table of Contents:<br /><br />Preface.<br />Contents:<br />1. Concepts in Physics.<br />2. Invariance and Conservation Laws.<br />3. Covariance, Scalars, Vectors, and Tensors.<br />4. The Discrete in Nature - The Atoms of Demokritos.<br />5.

But I have also done my best to make the text accessible to general readers with a basic scientific education who feel that their cultural curiosity concerning the contemporary conception of nature cannot be satisfied by popular writings.\\" I qualify as the \\"general reader\\" in the audience he addresses above who, \\"'cannot be satisfied by popular writings.\\"<br /><br />If you've been following my collection of physics books which I post at my 'Shared Purchases' and 'Listmania Lists' portion ..., then you can see that I tend to ambitiously bite off more than I can chew in my choice of intellectual reading. As I admitted in my profile, I am a guy with not much more than half a brain and a driving passion to know what the hell is really going on in this Universe. I have been eagerly searching for a book that will challenge me to grow beyond my comfort level of popular yet slightly technical introductory treatments of physics (specifically Quantum Electrodynamics). Well, I FINALLY FOUND IT! This is a special discovery! As I hope you can tell, I am very excited about my latest exposure to Tian Yu Cao's \\"Conceptual Developments of 20th Century Field Theories\\". Cao's wonderful book serves as a didactic bridge across the gapping void we serious laymen come up against when we've finished pussy-footing around with popular-introductory Quantum Physics books and are driven to explore further than our formal education (or lack thereof) will allow when delving deeper into the daunting world of QM. I'm trying to come up to a level where I can get some appreciation and comprehension of the principles in Quantum Field Theories. For example, I ambitiously procured my own copies of \\"Inward Bound\\" by Pais, \\"The Odd Quantum\\" by Treiman, Schweber's \\"QED and the Men Who Made it - Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga\\", and Mehera's, \\"The Beat of a Different Drummer - the life and science of Richard Feynman\\". I look at these books and think, \\"QM looks so beautiful! I want to get a comprehensive grip on this stuff'\\" Hopeless without University level courses in technical mathematics and physics right? I'm not convinced, I suppose I'll find out sooner or later. As it is, I just keep at it. Day after day, I immerse myself in QM literature with a passion driven by my obsessive curiosity of Nature and what we know of her physical reality. Light, Atoms, Electromagnetic Waves, Matter, Particles, and Fields; these are the things I feel compelled to investigate'<br /><br />Cao's book is another stepping stone in my self-directed journey of intellectual adventure. The pedagogy of the book is at a relatively safe and sane level for the explorer who is moderately courageous and not afraid to be uncertain about his/her competency in the learning curve. As I said, Cao's book bridges the terrible gap between the easy stuff (i.e. non-technical/popular/introductory/historical level) across the abyss towards the tougher stuff (i.e. technical/rigorously mathematical University level Introduction QFT textbooks). This is a very technical book for someone at my level but I believe that if you are somewhat like me (scary thought!) you can benefit from the book's pages when armed with a serious sense curiosity and a sincere desire to grasp deep & fundamental principles of Quantum Field Theory.<br /><br />There are some scary looking mathematical formulas but if you're courageous you can breeze over them and let the copious qualitative text speak to your understanding. The only subjects in this book that I don't find of particularly immediate interest to me are his sections on General Relativity as I'm not a Gravity (field) enthusiast yet. I've skimmed over those sections and suspect that I'll be back later to visit it with more interest in the future.<br /><br /> Be sure to carefully read the what the other reviewers have to say about their opinions of this book, look at the book description and 'Table of Contents' link above. I suggest looking at some of the following books as a prerequisite to this book if you are anywhere near my level of intellect: \\"Strange Beauty\\" by Johnson, \\"The Force of Symmetry\\" by Icke, \\"The Quantum World\\" by Polkingthorne, \\"The Second Creation\\" by Crease & Mann, \\"The Quantum Universe\\" by Hey & Walters, \\"Why Things Are the Way They Are\\" by Chandrasekhar, \\"QED (The Strange Theory of Light and Matter)\\" by Feynman, \\"The Great Design (Particles, Fields, and Creation)\\" by Adair, \\"Paul Dirac (The Man and His Work)\\" by Pais, Jacob, Olive & Atiyah, \\"What Makes Nature Tick?\\" and also \\"Thinking About Physics\\" both by Roger Newton<br /><br /> I hope you will forgive my enthusiasm in this review if I seem overly zealous.

This is such a great book that I've taken the time to prepare an annotated table of contents for this review:<br /><br />CONTENTS (very thorough - shows where all the sub-sections are)<br /><br />PREFACE (Begins with examples of \\"Quantum Mechanics in action\\". Here is a quote which I hope illuminates the author's sensitivity towards your desire come away from reading this with a sense of it's friendliness: \\"Physics is not difficult; it's just weird. Physics, contrary to the opinion of many journalists and parents of scientists, is not particularly hard to explain or to learn. To learn how to use relativity, you do not have to be Einstein; nor do you have to be Heisenberg to do Quantum Mechanics. Physics is weird because your intuition is false. To understand what an electron's world is like, you've got to be an electron, or jolly nearly.\\" Here are a few more points Icke makes before setting out on this wonderful journey of discovery: \\"Physics is powerful.\\", \\"Physics is beautiful.\\", \\"Physics is simplification, and so is explanation... This is the real stuff, even though there is a two-semester lecture series of heavy technical material behind every chapter. In fact, it is my intention that you could read this book right alongside a textbook on gauge theory.\\" I believe that, before you've finished this book, you will have happily come to the conclusion that this author has delivered a well-prepared & friendly presentation of his points in the above thesis.<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br /><br />1.

The very next section is titled \\"Feynman Paths\\" and brilliantly elucidates 'Action' and `field density'; the last section, 6.4 \\"Superposition and quantum sorcery\\", brings to light principles of second quantization, state vectors, eigenstates & eigenvalues.

(part 1)	Instant Physics: Years ago I was browsing through the science section of my favorite bookstore when I opened this book casually leafing around it's pages when I came across the first sentence which begins the Introduction,  \\"If you are a potential victim of this book, leafing through its pages while obstructing traffic in the science isle of your favorite bookstore, there is a good chance you took a physics course in the vanished days of your youth\\".  What a cowinkydink huh?  He goes on, \\"Perhaps you now want a refresher or perhaps, feeling guilty at your ignorance of the central role played by science in modern society, you merely wish to become a more cultured individual. In any case your knowledge of physics is inexcusably weak and, if you have indeed been exposed to the subject before, you probably regard the word `physics' as synonymous with `plague,' as in `to be avoided like the'.\\"  OK, I'm hooked! I flipped back to the dedication which almost makes me cry out in joy, \\"To my students, known and unknown. The known, who demonstrate with crushing directness that it is impossible to be too clear. The unknown, who suffer in silence.\\" I believe that he is addressing myself: I am an unknown student who silently yearns for information that would be presented clearly, accessibly; information that I can process into comprehension. I have yet to take a formal Physics course at a college or university (members only please). I love being surprised! (Don't you?) Dr. Rothman delivers this humble students unsolicited silent plea for attention grabbing/attention keeping material in this succinct &amp; concise presentation of the salient principles of the physical sciences. His wit, humor and sensitivity for the readers comfort over the hurdles of a seemingly steep learning curve are woven into the fabric of each page keeping the audience stimulated and giving you a sense that he wants you to participate in the great gift of learning.  In the beginning of the book lies his statement of goals, \\"...the goal of this book cannot be to give you a working knowledge of physics.... the more modest goal of Instant Physics is to give you an idea of why physicists believe what they believe and to train you to use this sacred knowledge in the war against the infidel.\\" (continued in part two)tement of goals, \\"...the goal of this book cannot be to give you a working knowledge of physics.... the more modest goal of Instant Physics is to give you an idea of why physicists believe what they believe and to train you to use this sacred knowledge in the war against the infidel.\\" (continued in part two)	2001-07-20

US	46871101	R2E3QBK1GG3U7M	0738202983	234166020	The Feynman Lectures on Physics: The Complete Audio Collection, Volume 8 (Audiocassettes)	Books	4	20	20	N	N	Live from Caltech, It's Professor Richard Feynman ! ! !	Six Wonderful Pieces! This is my first and favorite unabridged audio collection of Feyman's Lectures on Physics which he delivered during the month February in 1962 at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). These events occurred 21 months before and 21 miles away from where I was born here in Southern California! I eagerly listen to all of these tapes over &amp; over &amp; over again - reveling in his style of teaching (humorous, witty, and humble). Much of the quantitative eludication of subject material surpasse my comprehension. Nonetheless, I just relax during my long commute to work and absorb whatever sinks in.<br /> My only beef with this collection is that they (Helix Books/Perseus Publishing) left out some essential lectures which, in the book, complete the overall theme (i.e. light) such as his lectures on Polarization and the one on Radiation Damping/Light Scattering. Now, I understand that each volume of these boxed sets can probably only contain a maximum of six cassettes, however they ought to publish another collection that contains the &quot;missing&quot; lectures mentioned above. There are plenty of his other lectures on the subject of electromagnetics from the printed volumes to be found in the other series of Audio Volumes (e.g. audio volumes 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 10) however they are not quite cohesive in their contiguity (kind of scattered/clumped together).<br /> I have a total of nine (2-10) of the twelve currently available volumes (as of July 2001). Volumes 13 and 14 are forthcoming. See my 'Listmania Lists' for a convenient place to find almost all of the available Feynman audio.<br /> One of the cool things you can do with these audio lectures is to listen to them and then correlate them to the famous collected three volume-printed sets of the &quot;Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;. They relate very well in my opinion.<br /> FYI: this set of tapes is number eight in the audio collection series and the cassettes correlate to the printed lectures in the following manner:<br /> Cassette 1 is Volume 1, Chapter 26: The Principle of Least Time; cassette 2 is Volume 1, Chapter 27: Geometrical Optics; cassette 3 is Volume 1, Chapter 28: Electromagnetic Radiation; cassette 4 is Volume 1, Chapter 29: Interference; cassette 5 is Volume 1, Chapter 30: Diffraction; and cassette 6 is Volume 1, Chapter 31: The Origin of the Refractive Index.<br /> My favorite quotation out of these lectures is, &quot;And thus is the universe knit together. The atomic motions of a star still have sufficient influence at this great distance to set the electrons in our eye in motion, and so we know about the stars. If this law did not exist, we would all be literally in the dark about the exterior world!&quot;<br /> Collect 'em all and enjoy!

The on-line review system just throws it in with the rest of the Dune (like) reviews. It's really too bad that this review will get buried below all the Dune *printed* book reviews as you might never find out about such a sweet addition to complete your Dune experience...<br />This little gem, however, is another way to be totally entertained with more things Dune. The late great author Frank Herbert reads in this 4 cassette audio book compellation of related short stories and excerpts of Dune with such enthusiasm for his own words! It is very pleasant listening to him read because you get so completely caught up in his mastery of verbal story telling. His excitement is contagious! You can just imagine him in his quaint writer's garb, reclining on an easy chair amongst his bookshelves alight with the golden glow of fireplace flames in his warm &amp; cozy den looking across towards you - his eyes ablaze and his voice captivating your imagination...<br />Some of the stories include these selections from Dune:<br /> \\"The Banquet Scene\\", \\"Sandworms of Dune\\", \\"The Battles of Dune\\", and \\"The Truths of Dune: Fear is the Mind Killer\\"<br />I am an avid fan of the first Dune book! I even owned the very first Dune board game back in the 1980's after the first movie. It saved me from dying of boredom when my flight was laid-over at the International Airport in Seoul South Korea for over 20 hours while I was on duty with the U.S. Army in \\"Team Spirit\\" in 1986. I grabbed a few of my fellow fidgety soldiers and we played for well over 16 hours of that following morning, afternoon, and evening somewhere Korea! Sadly, I lost the game and I wish I still had it for all the warm memories of entertainment it served us. Wow, do I digress or what?<br />Remember to look up his book, 'Eye' too. 'Eye' is very hard to find but totally worth your search seeing as how it is such a treasured find! Here's a little help - search for ISBN: 0425083985<br />Have brain - will travel!

It holds some kind of strange attraction for me although it is definitely too advanced and mathematically quantitative for me to completely understand. Yet, I *really* like it... Hmm. Why is that?  This book is a friendly and curiously unique presentation of practical & theoretical aspects of light (electromagnetism).  Included in the book are discussions of the great ideas and men who helped advance our understanding of light - for example the book gives some discussion on the contributions of Newton, Young, Fresnel, Huygens, & Maxwell.  This isn&#8217;t just the &#8220;History of Science&#8221; stuff, it&#8217;s written in a captivating style to put our understanding in a cultural context.  Throughout the book are justifiably qualitative (fairly quantitative) presentations on the technical aspects of Diffraction & Interference, Polarization, Reflection & Scattering, and a neat chapter titled &#8216;Playing with waves (subtitled the \\"Voice of the Dragon\\"!)&#8217;. Finally my favorite and inspiring section, Science & Learning ('Self-Directed Learning').  I hope you give this book a chance like I did because, for me, there is a sea of information out there and I'm keeping afloat by sailing around in a boat which I'm building while I'm traveling the literally wonderful journey of self directed enlightenment. Dr. Silverman has sent out some fascinating building materials for me to pick up and try to incorporate. The book has brought me to the shores of a wonderful land, rich with appreciation for the most prevalent stuff in our Universe - LIGHT! Now I must confess: I am borderline incompetent when it comes to mathematics - so this book (like so many I try to wrap my brain around) escapes my full grasp. But I believe that it doesn't hurt to try stretching my mind beyond it's current capabilities. If anything, it makes me more flexible. My experience with this book has left me provoked to explore electromagnetism much further!!!<br />IndiAndy Intellectual Adventurer & Explorery Intellectual Adventurer & Explorer	2001-03-09

An excerpt from the preface:  &quot;...it is not a textbook full of long, boring proofs and hundreds of problems, rather it is an intellectual adventure, to be read with pleasure. It was written to be easily accessible and with concern for the mental tranquility of the reader who will experience considerable fulfillment when he/she sees the simplicity of basic mathematics. The emphasis throughout the book is on the clear explanation of mathematics concepts.&quot;<br />I have to say that the promises in the excerpt above are gracefully delivered. This is such a great book in it's scope. But it is completely missing graphic illustrations - you know, diagrams, figures, pictures, etc.. It could be the absolute best book hands down, if it just had illustrations in each chapter. Otherwise beautifully written. So, I can't give it five stars. A second edition with graphic illustrations would be awesome! You should know that there are no problem-solution exercises in the book but many good examples and applications are discussed. This book is very friendly and un-assuming. Kudos to the Authors!!!<br />OK, the chapters are as follows:<br />1. The Number System 2. Irrational Numbers, Imaginary Numbers, and Other Curiosities 3. From Arithmetic to Algebra 4. Graphic Algebra 5. The Geometry of Straight Line Figures 6. The Geometry of the Circle and Trigonometry 7. Analytic Geometry 8.

Im not knocking the book, its format is nicely laid out; the author's style is friendly, and the book follows a seemingly logical path - I just wasn't hooked by it. My imagination was not stimulated by the examples used by the author to illustrate her subject. I resorted to occasionally skipping around the paragraphs and chapters until I finally set it down for a long rest. So, as you can see, this is just the opinion of a guy who's probably being finicky. It wasnt what I was looking for. Maybe Ill re-visit it later in my pursuit of intellectual expansion and get more out of it. <br />May I suggest that you look into the book titled Who Is Fourier?: A Mathematical Adventure by the Transnational College of LEX. It is a Japanese workbook wonderfully translated into English which will 'hold your hand' through the mathematical learning curve with regards to waves. I think that 'Fourier' is better suited for learning about the mathematical treatment of Waves in it's extremely friendly walk-through of Trigonometry and light elements of Calculus - 'Fourier' is even easy for those, like myself, who're borderline incompetent in technical mathematics!<br />But what do I know? Im just another tourist trudging along the road of happy destiny with what Ive picked up along the way. The other reviewers are better suited to elucidate the pedagogical aspects of this book and, therefore, I recommend paying close attention to what they have to say.<br />The World According to Wavelets : The Story of a Mathematical Technique in the Making might be just what youre looking for. I know that each of us look for something which appeals to our particular (dare I say peculiar?) tastes. Check it out. Do the math. Look with your own eyes &amp; decide for yourself.
