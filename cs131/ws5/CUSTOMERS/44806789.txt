Doheny, C.S.C., and it is one of the most staggeringly beautiiful Catholic religious books I have read.  Some religious texts can seem a little dry, but this one is just alive with the life of Christ brimming from every page.  It is so powerfully written that its incredible force cannot be lost even through translation.  It is formatted by 195 separate readings, designed to be read one a day in cycles.  My copy says, \\"this book is not for sale,\\" but was only the subject of a limited number of copies, freely distributed to \\"friends and benefactors.\\"  I was led to find one at a library book sale for 1 dollar several years ago.  I had to write this review in the hope that someone else would look for and find this book for themselves.	2005-03-15

I can't remember now how I found this staggeringly beautiful chess book detailing the 1948 world championship tournament involving Botvinnik, Keres, Smyslov, Reshevsky, and Euwe.  The only bad thing about this book is the title, which led, no doubt, to its being virtually unknown today.  It is one on my favorite chess books.  The annotations are approximately half by Horowitz and half by Hans Kmoch, author of the famous \\"Pawn Power in Chess.\\"   I am a huge Kmoch fan, and am so pleased to have this book.  His annotations in print are few and far between, and the ones here sound more like the author of \\"Pawn Power,\\" than do those in another work of his, \\"Rubinstein's Chess Masterpieces.\\"  The present book contains all 50 games between the five superstars mentioned, deeply annotated (nearly all the games are d4-openings, plus several Frenches and Lopezes, with only one Sicilian).  There are many great photos of the tournament, including one of Smyslov calmly strolling around on the stage while two games are in progress, biographies of each player, caricature drawings of each player with humorous captions (one drawing has Smyslov as a snail).  And to top it all off, there is a 41-page treatise by Kmoch detailing the history of the opening in chess from Anderssen to Botvinnik.  This part alone is worth the price of the book to me.  Trust me, this book is a treasure, that is worth hunting down and buying.  I surely will never part with my copy.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-25

My hardcover of this called, \\"How Chess Games are Won,\\" and this book lives up to its title.  People say that Capablanca had a crystal clarity to his play.  To me, Reshevsky had this ability as well, but unlike Capa, he had a real gift for annotating chess as well.  Here are 59 of his best games from the second half of his career, when he was a fully mature adult and player.  This is a rare games collection where every single game is crucial to me.  Much of this is because I aspire to precisely Reshevsky's opening repertoire, playing 1. d4 as white, and Indians and the Sicilian as black.  Basically every game in this book is in those openings.  Reshevsky is a tremendous annotator.  He does not aim too high or low, but simply explains what is going on, in a manner that instructs, but more importantly in a manner that heightens my interest in the game.  How many authors can do this?  I have games collections written by each of the following players: Tarrasch, Tartakower, Capablanca, Alekhine, Timman, Kasparov, Karpov, Shirov, Botvinnik, Smyslov, Taimanov, Polugayevsky, Averbakh, Fischer, Euwe, Fine, and others.  Over time, I notice that undoubtedly I spend the most time with my Reshevsky collections, simply because they hold my interest and improve my play more than the others.  Of course, I would not trade any of the others, and love them all.  But these two Reshevsky books are my favorite.  I diasgree with another reviewer who awarded this book 3 stars because he felt it was not up to the standard as \\"Reshevsky's Best Games,\\" volume 1.  Personally, I like volume 2 more, mostly because R. had begun playing the Sicilian, and we get lots of Sicilian games.  It is true that there is less life-biography kind of stuff, but I sort of attribute that to his being an adult already at the start of this book.  However, I feel strongly that it is not fair to give this book 3 stars, compared to the drivel out there that gets 3 and more stars.  To each his own, but I felt compelled to inform chess book lovers out there that this one is definitely worth tracking down.  (I have the beatiful hardcover Pittman edition from 1973)	2004-11-10

I have a lot of chess books, and have written lots of reviews.  My reviews tend to not be very objective; rather, they are based on whether a book really held my interest, to an extent that I actually finished the book.  This is why I think \\"My System\\" by Nimzowitsch is perhaps the greatest single chess book: it holds my interest every time I work through it, in a way that few other books have.  This games collection by Reshevsky (my original copy is called \\"Reshevsky's Best Games of Chess\\") similarly holds my interest, and draws me into it deeper and deeper over time.  I cannot say that it has the fascinating peculiarities of a \\"My System,\\" or the unique engaging dialogue of an \\"Amateur's Mind,\\" yet there is something about the games and the annotations that is uniquely compelling to me.  Reshevksy's opening repertoire is exactly along the lines that I play, consisting almost exclusively of 1. d4 with white and the Sicilian and Indians as black.  Yet it is not just the repertoire, but the way he plays it and explains it that is so fascinating to me.  I am not a good enough player to fathom the \\"style\\" of a Karpov or a Kasparov (or  Shirov, Leko, etc.).  But for some reason, I find myself sensing something I can relate to in Reshevsky's games.  It involves his \\"pacing\\" of the opening and middlegame.  He plays the openings patiently, and seems to wait until his opponent makes a slight mistake before he gets aggressive.  I tend to overreach myself and get too hasty in the openings.  But Reshevsky has no problem playing e3 in response to a Slav.  It is as if he is playing a Colle without having to deal with ...c5.  This morning, I began studying a game in this book.  Normally, when I study a chess book early in the morning, I get tired after about a half hour.  Today, I was through three games in detail in about an hour before I even realized what time it was.  This is what happens to me when I read this book.  I cannot say objectively what it is; but I do know that this is one of my favorite chess books, because it has this magical quality that draws me into it and does not let go.  Under no circumstances would I ever sell this old Dover copy of this book.  If I were to lose it, I would do whatever it took to get another copy.	2004-11-09

There is really very little \\"Tao\\" in the book.  Basic chess principles, other than perhaps the idea of developing one's pieces harmoniously, do not really lend themselves to a Tao study, or, if they do, this study is certianly not it.  The book is little more than a listing of chess principles, with an example each to back them up.  This type of thing hardly ever works, simply because there is no rhyme or reason to the format.  It didn't work with GAMBIT's 101 Winning Chess Ideas (or whatever it was called), and it doesn't work here.  This is one of the few chess books I have ever bought and then returned.  It is nicely enough made and produced, it is just fairly useless and unnecessary compared to the plentiful quality chess works that are available.  Get Stean's Simple Chess or Evan's New Ideas in Chess instead.  Those classics will point you in the right direction to more advanced works.	2004-10-06

For years I have enjoyed Reshevsky's \\"Best Games of Chess,\\" which is volume 1 of his best games.  This work is volume 2.  The Pittman hardcover is such a nicely produced book.  Reshevsky's annotations and accompanying contextual stories of the games are very instructive for the intermediate player.  Personally, I mesh very well with his opening repertoire as well, as he invariably plays 1. d4, and answers 1. e4 with the Sicilian.  There are lots of games where he plays 4. e3 against the Nimzo, so one gets an education in this and some other openings (lots of King's Indians and Sicilians too).  Reshevsky's works, including as well \\"The Art of Positional Play,\\" are among my favorite chess books, and I am a little surprised that his best games collections have not been in print.  (Well, Hardinge Simpole recently re-published fairly expensive paperback editions).  The present book is an absolute joy of chess instruction and entertainment.	2004-09-15

Out of my 500+ chess books, I would say I use this one the most.  Tarrasch's annotations are great, succinct, and to the point, they are designed to teach and not confuse, and also shows you the development of his early career.  You see many games against sub-GM opposition, and I always feel such games are invaluable to the developing player.  (I also love, for this point, the two Euwe books, Chess Master Meets... etc.).  Another main reason I consult this book often is that Tarrasch played such good, common sense openings.  This book has tons of French Defences, from both sides, Queen's Gambits, Ruy Lopezes, and other things you don't see very often, like the Scotch Four Knights, The Goring Gambit, etc.  The book has a nice opening index.  It is an incredible book.  So why one star?  Because the book isn't really a &#34;book&#34; at all, but a lamely glued together collection of paper.  The book quickly falls apart with any frequent use (and you will use it frequently).  And by &#34;falls apart&#34; I mean the binding comes detached from the rest of the book and pages fall out.  This type of cheapo production is a disgrace, especially on such a wonderful text as Tarrasch created.	2004-08-26

Along with Mastering the Strategic Game, and How Karpov Wins, this is an essential part of my collection.

It is one of my favorite books.  It is everything wonderful in a chess book. First, it is a great games collection, with oever 100 well-annotated games.  Often, the annotations of the actual players are inserted.  The book is a perfect mix of variations and text, with an emphasis on ideas and instruction.  Second, the book is arranged by the names of openings, alphabetically.  This allows for you to quickly find games in an opening without even looking at the table of contents.  All the Sicilian games are right after the Ruy Lopez games, etc.  Third, the moves are formatted in columns, apart from the the text, making the book perfect for covering up the next move with an index card.  I am convinced over time that the best games collections also should serve as opening manuals.  I end up using them most often if they serve as such.  This classic work by Evans, and the two-volume set on Paul Keres by Varnusz are the best examples of this that I can think of right now.  (Of course, the Tartakower and DuMont epic is the original classic example of this; but the games in this Evans book have a modern flair, with lots of Sicilians, King's Indians, etc.).  In sum, this book is a classic that must be on the shelf of anyone serious about their chess book collection.	2004-07-27

I have even been heard to utter, in mock appreciation of Socrates, that \\"the uncaffeinated life is not worth living.\\"  One time I quit coffee, felt really good, but during a flat stage, I got back on, more than ever, with the comment that without caffeine, I had lost the \\"joy of living.\\"  I have read this book by Cherniske.  I have read all the reviews here.  I have laughed hardest at the ones that recommend \\"The Caffeine Advantage,\\" which supposedly about how great caffeine can make your life.  Perhaps this book is over the top in its indictment of coffee and caffeine.  But the fact is, that I will not quit the stuff without a little shouting at me to do it.  Those reasonable persons who would suggest to have only a cup a day or so, or who only have coffee in the morning, or who can go weeks without it, with no headaches; well, more power to you.  But I am not one of you.  I am an ADDICT.  I cannot drink coffee in moderation.  I can only drink it to excess, and it invariably messes up my life.  It messes with my sleep patterns, leading me to get less sleep and to then be tired often during the day.  It screws up my diet, causing me to binge on sweets to try to counter the feeling of being too hyped up and hungry from caffeine.  It messes with my breathing, as I occasionally experience a shortness of breath sensation that I notice when I am drinking lots of caffeine.  And most of all, I know all of this in my heart.  I know that caffeine is bad for me, that using it is using a powerful drug, and that the only answer for me is to get of it completely.  There is no possibility of moderation.  I have tried that most earnestly and failed.  This book has provided the only successful incentive I have ever had to make a serious effort to get myself off caffeine.  And I have not done it yet.  It is a battle.  But I know it must be done.  As I write this, I am in day 3 of weaning off in  accordance with the guidance of the book.  Tosum up, referring to the title of my review, look at your own heart.  You know, many of you, that caffeine is bad for you.  So don't kid yourself, get off of it, and be the person you were created to be.	2004-06-28

I keep coming back to it again and again, unlike the hundreds of supposed classics that sit on my shelf un-opened.  Many say that games collections annotated by the GM who played the games are the best teaching tools.  The problem that I often have is that there is no connecting themes between the games.  I play the French as black.  So, I would like to have a games collection of games in the French.  The Korchnoi Best Games book is great because there are quite a few games where he plays the French.  And of course there are books by and about Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik where a few French games are featured.  But here we have a unique book by Uhlmann.  In all 60 games of this book, he plays black in the French.  The annotations are brilliant, concise, and instructive to follow, without being too dense or over-the-top, as are annotations by Nunn, Speelman, and Timman.  Those are all good authors, but they do not write for the masses; they write for top-flight GMs.  This book has a directness and an instructive theme that is lacking in those other works.  It will inspire you to play the French, and will inspire your chess in general.  It is one of the best chess books that I know.	2004-06-24

This is one of my favorite chess books.  It shows how Adams' play developed through his childhood through maturity.  True, it does not address some of the points that the Moscow reviewer notes, but why do reviewers rate books so much based on the title?  This is a games collection by a top GM, annotating his own games.  Adams is succinct, instructive, blunt, and he plays a universal e4- repertoire that is woderful for the average player to emulate.  I have over 500 chess books, and this and its sequel, &quot;Chess in the Fast Lane&quot; have emerged over time as two of my favorite games-collection books.

I think &quot;Taming the Sicilian&quot; is a very interesting book, with an effective and original way of meeting the Sicilian.  This book, however, on the Reti, struck me as lacking the fire or originality to make it anything special.  In fact, it is one of the few chess books I have ever returned for a refund.  Perhaps I was not completely fair to this book, but everything about it struck me as half-baked.  First, there is the standard 144 pages from Everyman.  When they produce a very special work, such as that on the Nimzo-Larsen Attack by Jacobs and Tait, this page limit does not apply.  That wonderful work was 192 pages.  So, you have the pot-boiler 144 pages, but what is worse, is that Davies' introduction in this Reti book is a &quot;Schiller-esque&quot; copy of his intro. in Taming the Sicilian.  This is just lame.  The exact same advice is given, which adds to that feeling that this book was &quot;cranked out&quot; rather than being a labor of love.  But what finally did me in was his recommendation against the Reti Accepted (dxc4).  He says that the normal ways of playing to regain the pawn, Na3 or Qc2, lead to equality for black; so he recommends the very rare e4!?  This gives you a backward d pawn in exchange for &quot;dynamic&quot; play.  He never even discusses the other moves, so e4 is his only recommendation.  Well, I quickly realized that I don't want to play e4, and since you see dxc4 all the time (indeed, it seems like the best move), this left me with a very bad feeling about this book, as in, I shouldn't have bought this book.  This is not to say that it is not well-written or does not contain plenty of interesting well-annotated games.  But I felt compelled to write this review for the benefit of anyone who perhaps buys a few too many chess books, to tell them, this seems like one of those &quot;too many.&quot;	2004-06-07

The answer is: it is Watson that bothers me!  He is a very good writer and has invested an enormous amount of work into this book.  However, the arrogance and presumptuousness of its message are what irritate me.  I think Watson's method in this book smacks of intellectual arrogance, lacking the humility with which he should address his subject.  The subject is primarily the idea that chess is largely \\"rule-independent\\" and that Nimzowitsch and the classicists were wrong in saying things like \\"you should only move one or two pawns in the opening.\\"  Nowhere does Watson provide the necessary qualifications to his work; namely, that the general rules are an essential roadmap to learning chess as a beginner or intermediate, and that general rules are GENERAL rules.  He acts like its a big revelation that because Fritz 8 can prove that a position with 10 early pawn moves is playable, therefore the general rule that you shouldn't make too many early pawn moves is invalid.  He misses the main point in this regard: that the top players in the world have incorporated computers into their home analysis and thus into their play.  Yes, this has changed some of the \\"truth\\" of the game in the sense that theory is subject to being changed by computer analysis.  Put it this way: imagine the computer analysing a difficult chess position is like a metal detector searching for needles in a haystack.  Watson is saying, \\"because I have this metal detector, the general rule that it is difficult to find a needle in a haystack no longer is valid.  The detector quickly finds the needle.\\"  This absurd view assumes that everyone who looks for things that have metal in them has a metal detector, just as Watson's profession to have shown the rules to be invalid assumes that everyone has a powerful computer to analyze for them.  So, who then is Watson writing for?  Clearly,the GM's who play the complex opening systems he describe--those opening systems that flaunt the traditional rules--do not need to hear his theory.  They, after all, are the ones using the computers to provide the data Watson has used to create it.  On the contrary, a book like this is really being directed at the intermediate player who has an intellectual fascination with chess.  But on that level, the book is an utter failure.  Because for every Sicilian Najdorf with multiple early pawn moves, there are three Ruy Lopezes with \\"traditional\\" principles governing the opening.  99% of chess players are better off following the general rules, and risk being misled by Watson's claim that those rules are not valid.  Yes, there are exceptions to every general rule.  Exceptions do not make a rule invalid.  And yes, perhaps some of the old rules used with beginners should not provide to modern GM play.  But Watson should have qualified his points repeatedly, in the way that Marovic put it in his recent work, \\"Understanding Pawn Play in Chess\\": \\"We have been trying to learn lessons and draw logical conclusions not in order to respect them to the letter, but in order to understand them so well that we can see beyond the rules and disregard general advice.  Only he who commands the laws of the chessboard to perfection can do that\\" (p. 206)  Marovic's further statement in \\"Dynamic Pawn Play in Chess\\" also shows the lack in Watson of a similar perspective: \\"It is quite easy to say that general laws and maxims are useless, that only speecific analysis of specific cases leads to the truth, but how then could we upgrade our play to the level on which we can evaluate the course of a chess game on our own?  How, then, could chess teaching function?\\" (pp. 254-255).  It is Watson's failure to add this perspective to his work that leads to its downfall.  As a scholarly treatise I find that to be a fatal flaw in his work.  The book deserves at least three stars just for its incredibleamount of work and ambition, even though it fails as to its main premise.	2004-02-25

I will summarize a few reasons why it is one of my all-time favorite chess books: 1) Brilliant games, many of them very long, with endgames.  Many of the games are over 60 moves long.  The annotations do not bog you down, though, so you do get through the games.  Reshevsky brilliantly points out themes at various points, and you naturally start to see it as you go through the games; 2) annotations that are concise, and dead-on the point.  Each annotation seems to relate to the ideas inherent in the position.  There are variations as necessary to flesh out ideas.  The annotations are very instructive.  They remind me of Fischer's in 60 Memorable Games, but from a d4 type player instead; 3) the book in effect presents an entire opening repertoire, basically Reshevsky's.  This means that you play 1. d4 with white and the Sicilian (he normally played the accelerated dragon or the Najdorf; I have settled on the accelerated dragon).  There are a lot of games where Reshevsky is white defeating a King's Indian.  These games alone are worth the price of admission for me, as I often face the King's Indian.  For these reasons and more, this is one of my favorite books.  It is true that there are numerous typos in the book, but it has not bothered me.  Normally, it is clear what was meant, and I just write the proper number or letter over in pen.  I have the older McKay edition, which is very nicely formatted, with diagrams in well-thought out places.  I really love this book a lot.	2004-02-09

But, for no apparent reason, this book based on Karpov's black repertoire (at one time) is not nearly as good.  A big part of this is the lack of materia.  Whereas, the Kramnik series was five volumes, this one prsents an entire back repertoire in one volume that is only around 200 pages.  This means that many variations are not found in this book.  It is still pretty good, but very disappointing compared to the excellent volumes that make up the remainder of the series.	2004-01-16

This is all the major games played in 2000 with incredible annotations.  Lots of good interviews with top players.  The only weird thing is how these Chess Stars guys act like the Kasparov-Kramnik match wasn't legitimate, and that Khalifman and Anand are the real world champions, based on the FIDE knockout things.  So there is coverage of the &#34;World Championship&#34; of 2000, but the Kasparov-Kramnik match is mentioned as a sort of footnote, like it was of little significance.  But everyone knows that the K-K match in 2000 did historically determine the new champion, Kramnik, and that history will never show that Khalifman was a champion, even though he was FIDE champ for a year.  Despite this self-delusion, the authors have put together an amazing book, that is the best modern games collection I know.	2003-12-30

However, the book fails in its goal, assuming that goal is to instruct you how to analyse.  Like many mediocre books, this one states its conclusions without showing how it got there.  For instance, Jacobs will show you how a player picked the wrong move, but if he had analysed more, he would have found the right move, x.  He does not, however, explain why x is a better move, except to show that it would have won, etc.  Not recommended.	2003-12-23

No player ever has maintained such a high level oif play over such a long period, except perhaps Korchnoi, but it is unlikely that he ever reached Lasker's level, at least when compared to his peers.  Lasker's games are endlessly fascinating.  You can see him play Steinitz, Alekhine, and Botvinnik; the King's Gambit and the King's Indian.  He was there for a lot of history.  He was a tenacious fighter, at every stage of the game.  These books are amazing games collections to have.  All fo the games are annotaed, some heavily, in Informator style.

At last count I have 350+ chess books, and probably 35 of them are games collections by GMs. My favorites are, in no order, &quot;Secrets of Grandmaster Chess&quot; by Nunn, Korchnoi's recent two-volume work, Kasparov's &quot;The Test of Time,&quot; Tarrasch's &quot;Three Hundred Chess Games&quot;, Timman's Best Games, Alekhine's Best Games, and Taimanov's Best Games. But over time, one book has emerged for me as head and shoulders above all of them, and this is Tartakower's &quot;My Best Games of Chess, 1905-1954.&quot; It is a shockingly brilliant work, on every level that matters to me. It contains 210 games, annotated with brilliant wit, humor, and chess insight. Tartakower was so placed historically to have crossed swords with the old masters, the hypermoderns, and some of the modern Soviet era post-war players. He saw it all, and created some of it. His opening repertoire was varied and interesting. There are Catalans, Frenches, of course his namesake variation in the Queen's Gambit, Retis, Blumendfeld Counter-Gambits, Nimzo-Indians, orangutangs! (which he invented after 'consulting' with an orangutang during a pre-tournament visit to a zoo with other players), and many more. He talks often about static versus dynamic action, of critical moments, coordination of forces, outposts, etc., in a wonderfully instructive and enlightening manner. But it is his writing style that really stands out. One reads Alekhine's annotations and pictures this severe man, chain-smoking cigarettes, pounding the table to make his point. One sees Nimzowitsch as the slightly deranged mad scientist, fascinating but obscure. Tartakower comes across as the brilliant and kind professor, who holds you spellbound as you soak up everything he says. Many games collections ebb and flow. Sometimes I get bored with them or decide to only play through certain openings. This massive book (450 pages) has me glued to every game, not wanting to miss a thing. The games are introduced by little storiesof the setting that shed humorous light on many figures in chess history. He gives personalities to many of the secondary lights, whose names we have only seen in books. For instance, check out his introduction to game 57 against Mieses (I have babbled enough and it is better to give you a sample of his writing): &quot;As was said by the French master, Alphonse Goetz (who had come as a journalist representing several French newspapers) in a fine speech during the opening ceremony, one could not find a place more idyllically suited for a tournament than Baden-Baden. In the first week of this tournament, although I ran all sorts of risks, I only succeeded in drawing my first five games. Relying then, on this 'law of series,' Master Mieses facetiously apostrophised me on the eve of our encounter with these bantering words: 'Have you had sufficient preparation for obtaining your 6th draw?' These thoughtless words must have evidently provoked Destiny, who sleeps (according to a Homeric phrase) 'on the knees of the gods,' and here is how this anticipated 'draw' turned out.&quot; Here are a couple of remarks from that game: &quot;7. QxP P-K3 Giving himself up to passive defence, Black shelters behind bastions that still seem intact.&quot;; &quot;13. 0-0 B-Q2 Asthma-breathlessness-suffocation: as usually occurs, the germ of an incurable sickness does not stop spreading, and so gradually leads to catastrophe.&quot; The book also explores critical variations at length where appropriate. This book may be hard to find these days, but I cannot recommend it enough. It is may favorite chess book.	2003-11-20

This book has absolutely nothing to distinguish it as an instructive chess book for intermediate players.  The annotations are bland and un-informative.  Comparable games collections by Kasparov, Nunn, Timman, Korchnoi, Gligoric, Karpov, and countless others far exceed this work by Anand.  You can get a games collection of any player downloaded off the internet, so the only reason to buy a games collecion is for its instructive or informational value.  But this 300+ page work is full of comments like, \\"I figured if this move was good enough for Tal, it was good enough for me.\\"  Real enlightening, huh?  This is a well-produced GAMBIT publication, but for whatever reason, Anand's writing is very bland.  This is an un-inspired work.  It is one of the few chess books that I have returned after purchasing.  Completely unnecesary.  Obviously, Anand is an all-time great player.  But he is no writer or teacher.	2003-11-12

(by the way, the reviewer from Sweden who deducted 2 stars for a few very minor notation issues is out of line giving this bookk 3 stars).  Rubinstein's games are wonderful teaching tools: his games have a clarity like those of Capablanca, but his opening repertoire is more in line with what the intermediate player might play.  Kmoch gives plenty of variations to challenge you, and many of these games have liong endings.  At the price, this is one of the most valuable books in chess literature.  This book is relatively unknown, but it has been around a long time.  Note that Hans Berliner credited a careful study of this book with his development of &quot;The System.&quot;  Not that Rubinstein or Kmoch are to be blamed for the idiosynacies of that book; but the point is to show that this book has influenced players and authors.  It is a great book.	2003-10-27

Qd6.  This is an excellent opening to play, as you have a good chance of knowing it much better than white.  The book is light on instruction, heavy on variations.  But there is a nice history section and good sumamries of chapters to let you know the overview of what's going on.  The format of the book is quite a bit like the Blackmar-Diemer Keybook II by Sawyer, with 40 base games, filled with hundreds of game fragments.  There is an excellent index and bibliography.

Lasker's first strategy book, entitled &quot;Chess Strategy&quot; was written before World War I.  The present book is an update of that timeless classic.  If you have and love the first one, you still need this newer book.  Lasker made corrections (rather, improvements) from the original, and he added new sections on more modern openings, such as the Indian Defenses, and there is a section on the Sicilian too, which was not in the original.  Plus, there are 20 new annoated illustrative games, covering 60 pages.  To this day, I have found no one who annotates a game for the intermediate player more beautifully than Edward Lasker.  The only writer I can compare him too for instructional value is Jeremy Silman.  Each has a unique and rare gift of being able to translate chess into ideas that are understandable to the average player.  There are many chess players out there who do not know what a great and important chess writer Lasker was.  His works are essential parts of my collection.	2003-09-09

I can think of no one else who combines thoroughness, explanatory text, complete games, and relevant variations so well.  Even in the densest theoretical parts of the complexities of the semi-slav, Wells retains the subject matter as a comprehendbale discussion or lecture.  Never, is this merely a dry text or data dump.  His ebooks are always long, too; he never skimps or hurries to finish a work; you will find the same thoroughness at page 300 as page 15.  He emphasizes recurrent themes, but this is no beginner text.  This is one of my favorite books, and it should be sought after and obtained by any 1. d4 player or black semi-slav player, because, despite the fact that is nine years old, it is an ageless and wonderful book.	2003-09-02

None of the three are complete: all of them have significant omissions in terms of the scope of coverage.  And the &quot;question and answer&quot; format is a great idea, but it doesn't really work very well.  Too often, the questions aren't even questions, but just exclamations such as &quot;Oh Dear!&quot; by an imaginary befuddled reader.  His answers have a slick smoothness that sometimes do not really answer the questions.  One gets the feeling that these books were turned out quickly.  They're not really for beginners, but they are not thorough enough to be stand alone treatises on their respective openings.  In the end, they succeed mostly as annotated games collections.	2003-09-02

What is troubling and surprising is some shoddy analysis.  For instance, on page 367 the authors present the &quot;theoretical novelty&quot; of 12... Qe7 in one of the main lines of the popular 4. Be3 system.  The annotation states that, &quot;if now 13. c4, Black responds with 13... b4 and white doesn't have 14. c5 because of 14...Nxc5.&quot;  I noticed going though the Yrjola &quot;Explosive Chess Repertoire for Black&quot; book that in fact he has 14. c5 as the white move in this situation.  Nxc5 actually appears to lose the game because of the reply Qxb4!  This is very simple to spot, and it is inconceivable that the authors could have so flippantly made the wrong conclusion on such an important line.  The problem with this is much more serious than, say, a typo, because it throws the credibility of the entire work into question.  Suffice it to say that this book was written without computer analysis.  It's still a great book, but the hit has taken with me is serious because of that error and others I have found as well.	2003-08-22

This is really a repertoire book for white, but without covering all openings.  He focuses on lines where quick resolution is brought about, so that a complex middlegame is avoided.  For instance, against the King's Indian, he recommends an early dxe5, followed by the exchange of queens and Bg5, Nd5, etc.  Similarly, Mednis recommends the Spanish Exchange.  Other openings covered are: the Sicilian Dragon and Accelerated Dragon, the Pirc, the Modern, Queen's Indian, Grunfeld, English/Reti, and the French.  Each chapter contains heavy verbal annotations of the main recommended lines, making this a phenomenal instructive manual on both the opening and the endgame.  The illustrative games contain many beautiful and instructive endgames.  Mednis really shined as a chess author, and this is, in my opinion, one of his most valuable works.	2003-08-07

In a clearly very thoroughly researched book the Nimzo-Larsen is explored in detail in almost 200 packed pages. There are a couple of nice features of this book which are rare in modern publications. Firstly at many points in each illustrative game, as well as sub-games and variations there are objective comments assessing the position or possible plans which definitely helps guide the student through the material. Although to be expected from CCIM Jonathan Tait, it is nevertheless pleasing to see so many correspondence games included.  Often these are critical to the evaluation of particular variation featuring new ideas or more accurate assessments of known position but are often ignored by opening books which largely concentrate on over-the-board games. The authors are also objective in their statement that there is no theoretical advantage for white in this opening but clearly opening 1. b3, or 1.Nf3 followed by b3, is a sound and solid way to begin the game and one which is too easy to underestimate. I would expect to see many players attracted to playing this opening and this book should finally remove the taint associated with this opening that remained for years following Larsen's spectacular defeat by Spassky in the USSR-Rest of World 1970 Match.	2003-08-01

There are a handful of books that sort of &quot;stun&quot; me with how brilliant they are.  &quot;Pawn Power in Chess&quot; and &quot;The Amateur's Mind&quot; come to mind.  Although this Nimzo-Larsen book is not an instructive manual like those classics, it is equally classic and equally stunning.  If you see it on the shelf at a bookstore, it just looks like another Everyman opening book.  But when you pull it off the shelf, the first thing you notice is its weight.  It is 193 pages long, not 144 or 160 pages like nearly all other Eveyrman books.  With its double-column format and dense print, it seems like about 500 pages worth of material.  But of course length does not equal quality.  What distinguishes this work is the incredible depth of its research and information, and its passion.  These authors wrote as if they were being paid great sums of money for this work.  In a note, they will compare a line to another game.  But instead of just saying, &quot;white/black was better,&quot; they say, &quot;the remaining moves of the game were...&quot; and give all the remaining moves, with important annotations.  This is incredibly helpful, because in the Nimzo-Larsen you will frequently arrive at an equal middlegame with perhaps a slight plus for white, and your endgame skills will decide the day.  So, it is essential that the authors did this.  Consequently, you have hundreds and hundreds of complete games in the notes.  You absorb and learn the opening.  But do not get the impression that this is a data-dump.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a labor of love, that has to be seen to be believed.  The annotations are insightful and meaningful, with constant note of transpositions (also huge in the N-L), and constant verbal evaluations of moves and positions and references to other sources (the bibliography is the largest I have ever seen).  These games were put under a microscope, and we get to savor the results.  I flipped forward to the end of the book, thinking, it can't be this good for 200 pages!  Yet the quality and depth never lags, through all 69 main annotated games and all the others in the notes.  I somehow feel that I cannot do justice to this book.  It is so important to the aspiring chess player.  It is so packed that I will never exhaust its tresures.  The Nimzo-Larsen (1. b3 or 1. Nf3, 2. b3) is a great versatile opening to study.  One reason for this is that it offers innumerable opportunities for transposition, such as to the English, the Reti, and the Queen's Gambit.  It thus has flexibility, which is a key to success in modern chess.  But, opening aside, this is a uniquely wonderful opening work.  These authors treat every game like it is their one and only chance to teach, enlighten, and to bring out all they can about the game in question.  The annotations are as good a blend of text and variations as I have ever seen.  Spend some time with this book, and its qualities grow larger and larger, to the point that I am practically in disbelief to how amazing it is!	2003-08-01

It is perhaps conceivable that uneducated persons in rural areas could take this nonsense as gospel, but the fact that many hundreds of people still believe in this book to this day is a tribute to a basic human idiocy which subordinates our God-given reason to the babblings of anyone claiming to be an authority. Has there ever been a cult leader who had no followers? This book is written in a flowery, old English kind of dialect, Eddy apparently believing that it carries greater religious weight to say \\"thy heart,\\" instead of \\"your heart.\\" And there are all these nonsensical expressions, like saying of God that he is \\"all in all.\\" She uses obscurity as such to cloak her work in the guise of religious power. She only said one accurate thing in her book: the time for Thinkers has come! Why haven't Christian scientists listened to this admonition?

It took me a long time to arrive at the place where I inevitably had to find this book.  I find it to be the most succinct, beautiful, practical, and accurate work on the spiritual life that I have ever read.  Long and bumpy is the path to arrive at this book, Wings of Joy.  First I went through Catholicism; its rigid literalistic theology, though, leaves something missing for the thinking person.  Then, Buddhism, with its deep meditation and striving for enlightenment.  But there is something big missing there too: its rejection of the world is too non-intuitive, and does not make sense in trying to live a harmonious unified life.  Then other independent religious thinkers, like Osho, whose books are wonderful and inspiring, but who demands that we tear down everything we have learnt from any institution (parents, church, state, etc.), in order to achieve the freedom that is our birthright.  This may be the right way, but its radicalness can leave one feeling rudderless (in a bad way).  It all leads to Sri Chinmoy, who, seemingly with direct access to God and the soul, has written a work that transcends them all.  He does not reject religion, but says that they all contain truth: &quot;each religion is right, absolutely right, in its own way, but when we cry for the highest truth, love of God becomes our only religion.&quot;  Have you ever seen a more perfect statement.  He does not reject the body or the world.  He says the body needs the soul to illuminate it, and the soul needs the body to manifest the soul.  So logical, so true, so inspired.  Love is the answer, as it should be; not some detached enlightenment.  There is not only one path, as too many religions demand.  In short, this is the man, and this is the book.  May you love it and each other	2003-07-31

After reading about 25 pages, I had to stop, because it is so badly written.  The setting with the old guru at the gas station is completely contrived, and not enough detail is provided to give the story any credibility.  For instance, in one early scene,the old guru is sitting in a chair.  Then, when our trampoline-champion hero looks again a moment later, the old guy is up on the roof looking at the stars.  No way!  How did he get up there!  Then, the guy keeps asking the old guy, for several pages, \\"how did you get on the roof?\\"  The old guy just laughs, and basically asks mysterious questions that suggest, \\"you really don't know anything that you think you know.\\"  This is real drivel, that might be considered precocious if written by a 12-year old.  Stories which have supernatural characters are effective only when the setting is made to seem realistic.  The attempt at realism is lost when the writing itself is poor, and the details are contrived.  \\"The Greatest Miracle in the World\\" by Og Mandino and \\"Illusions\\" by Richard Bach come to mind as successful well-written examples of this genre.  But in this book by Millman, there is no such believability established.  The guy comes upon this gas station, and this old guru simply starts teaching him the meaning of life.   For this to be a reasonably well-known book that has a \\"20th Anniversary\\" edition is rather shocking.  Simply put, this guy is not a good writer.  His sentence structure and word choice is awful, and his scenes have a wooden falseness that renders the whole thing unreadable.  And don't tell me \\"it's the message, not the medium\\" which is important.  The message--that we are all too self-absorbed, that we need to embrace the universe, awaken to reality, etc.-- has been forcefully transmitted by so many great written works, that we don't need second rate stuff like this to tell us what we already know.   Admittedly,succeeding in this \\"wise-old-guy-who-teaches-regular-guy-mysteries-of-life\\" genre is not so easy; but this effort is an appalling wreck that cannot seriously be considered as literature.  I have nothing against the author.  More power to him for his success with this book.  I have never had anything published, so I am not looking down on him.  It's just very surprising to me that people think this book is good.	2003-07-18

I have found this book to be a revelation.  I am 40 years old, and a heavy runner.  I had been experiencing all sorts fo nagging injuries, and, after reading this book, it occurred to me that perhaps I had been eroding my muscle mass by too much running.  Since then, I have cut down the running, begun lifting (with the great and clearly presented workout plan), and I have been stunned by the results.  I have lost some \\"softness\\" around my middle, my muscle tone has improved considerably, I feel incredibly good, and I am eating better than I have ever have.  And, yes, my \\"testosterone\\" feels great.  Perhaps much of this information is not new.  But I had never heard it before.  The key for me is that the diet is so good.  I am never hungry, as you eat five times a day, with mid-day snacks consisting of peanuts, cottage cheese, glassed of juice or chocolate milk, etc.  This is no \\"Atkins\\" type of extreme.  Rather, you cut out the crap, and you eat lots of protein and whole grains.  It is very practical and very healthy.  What is most remarkable to me is how good I feel.  This program has revitalized me, and I feel better than I did when I was running 40 miles a week (now I am running about 6-10 miles a week).  I feel stronger, fitter, thinner, and even mentally I feel more alert and less sluggish.  This is a great book that completely delivers.  And it is well written and a joy to read as well.  A great book for Men's Health.	2003-07-09

Books	1	17	53	N	N	A little truth is a dangerous thing	Many religious lunatics have made an impression on American history by citing just enough truth to make their homespun theories seem plausible.  Mary Baker Eddy is a classic example of this.  If she had told her followers to drink cool aid laced with cyanide to rid themselves of the body, which isn't real anyway, she would universally be recognized as evil.  But her insidiousness is more subtle than that, and her power to seduce remains alive in the world today.  She cloaks her irrational scheme in the wisdom and love of Jesus, and acts as if he is the authority which blesses her creation.  It is obvious that the bible can be quoted in a manipulative manner to support just about any ridiculous idea.  The Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because the bible says you should not \\"drink blood.\\"  Hello?  Anyone home?  These people die for their beliefs, supposing their deaths to be noble because in line with their absurd interpretation.  Thousands of innocent women were murdered because the bible says we should \\"not suffer a witch to live.\\"  Similarly, thousands upon thousands of Christian Scientists have needlessly suffered and died because of the absurd web of half-truths and lies woven by master charismatic illusionist Eddy.  Eddy has convinced them that the REAL reason Jesus healed all diseases is because he realized that a person is Spirit and not matter, that matter is unreal, therefore matter cannot suffer disease or death, therefore disease and death do not exist!  Voila!  If you just realize this with sufficient force, you cannot suffer diease or death either.  Of course, we all have doubts and that's why you die eventually.  Better still, we won't discuss death at all, since it is an illusion.  Christian Scientists generally die hidden away in their basements, ostracized by their families for their lack of faith.  There are three reasons that this \\"religion\\" has survived: one, children will believe anything their parents tell them, especially if it is repeated enough; two, the \\"church\\" historically has a lot of money; and three, the rest of us get inoculated from serious disease, which means that the \\"Scientists\\" don't get them either.  Except when they do.  But we won't talk about that.  For instance, when an outbreak of flu knocked out the whole student body of Christian Science \\"college\\" Principia, it was because the students fell victim to \\"mortal mind\\" and started believing the news reports that the disease was present.  Of course, most people couldn't care less about Christian Science.  I mean, the adherents generally are trying to love one another; they do not bother the rest of us.  The people who truly hate Christian Science are those who have suffered needlessly thereby, such as the mothers and fathers who lost children due to some preventable and treatable childhood ailment (like something stuck in your windpipe).  There are lots of them out there, people who are angry that they were lied to, that they were weak enough to be led down the garden path, that their loved ones died because of it, and because the rest of them are still oblivious.  It is an insidious religion, whose secrets cannot be discussed by members, and in which doubters (or independent thinkers) are shunned.  It all comes from this book written by Eddy, whose egomania was only kept in check, evidently, by her being reasonably sure that she wasn't God.  (She most likely was the lady in Revelations with stars around her feet and fire coming from her nose, or whatever).  The joke is not on her, though: she obtained the power and fame that she sought.  No, the joke is on the poor kids who grow up believing in this nonsense because mommy and daddy told them it was so.  The continued existence of Christian Science is more proof that there just may be no hope for mankind to overcome all its silliness.	2003-07-07

It is one of the most important chess books.  Nimzowitsch is difficult to comprehend, but his vision and his principles can take you to the promised land where you have a sense of really understanding chess.  Absorb this book, and your chess will become more interesting and rational.  You will have reasons for your moves.  This book, and Nimzo's vision of chess, is mostly about pawn play in the final analysis.  Pawns ARE the soul of chess, and I have never seen books that really get at the heart of pawn play like Nimzo's.  This book contains heavily annoated games by this chess genius.  Plus, there are many narrative discussions where he further elucidates the principles of pawn play in chess.  Absolutely essential for any serious chess book collection.	2003-06-18
US	44806789	RZJIZAV6J6XY4	0080320775	189778375	Play the Anti-Indian Systems	Books	5	18	20	N	N	special book	There are several excellent opening books from the early '90s published as part of the \\"Maxwell Macmillan Chess\\" series.  The format these books followed was so sensible and instructive that one wonders why other publishers have not followed it.  More on that later.  The overriding theme of this book is that white does not play c4 on move two; rather, he plays Nf3 and sends the queen's bishop out to g5 or f4; then, he may play c3 to secure d4, and he aims for e4.  This approach is similar to the Colle against 1... d5, so Colle players definitely will want to have this book, especially since Koltanowski and others recommend a king's indian response as best against the Colle.  The book has three parts: Part I examines the \\"Torre-Petrosian Attack,\\" which consists of 1. d4 Nf6, 2. Nf3 e6, 3. Bg5.  It is heartening to hear Varnusz explain that the young Tigran Petrosian was frustrated when facing the Nimzo- and Queen's Indian, and that he turned to the Torre Attack as a simpler, direct response thereto.  If a world champ used this line, then it may be good enough for me.  Part II explores white's approach to a king's indian response with ...g6.  Varnusz does not promise a distinct advantage with this line, just as Burgess, in his book on the Torre Attack, contends that Bg5 is not the critical response to the king's indian set-up.  However, this does not mean that it is not a practically effective system.  Nor does it mean that black has an edge! Again, Petrosian played this system, as have other grandmasters, including Ribli, Trifunovic, and Kasparov (vs. Martinovic, Baku, 1980).  What I especially like about the chapters in Part II is that Varnusz offers you several alternate systems to the king's indian response.  These include what Burgess calls \\"The London System\\" in his book, \\"Beating the Anti-King's Indians,\\" as well as a finachetto approach with g3.  Part III of the book recommends lines against Benoni and Benko gambit approaches.  Again, the same ideas are applied, with white refraining from c4 in favor of Nf3 and Bg5.  If you combine this book with Summerscales's excellent work, \\"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire,\\" you have an excellent practical approach with the white pieces.  Personally, I like the London System more than the Barry Attack, as in the latter you play Nc3, blocking the c-pawn, which always feels awkward.  With the London System, you have not violated any principles.  With these systems, you are not playing the absolute best lines as white, as master practice has long established that 2. c4 is the best move for white.  However, if you know these systems well, you will have an advantage over most of your opponents, in that you are playing on your turf instead of his.  Many black players are waiting to trot out the king's indian, the Benko, the Nimzo, etc., and you are denying them the chance to use their favorite line.  They should still be able to find their way, but, again, you will have dictated the course of the game, and this is an invaluable advantage at the \\"club\\" level.  Do not disparage the club level.  For years, I fumbled around with 2. c4 because it was supposed to be best.  Invariably, though, I found myself playing against someone's pet line.  Since I turned to the systems espoused by Varnusz (and Summerscale against 1... d5), my results have improved, and I have enjoyed my chess more too.  Back to this book and its format.  In each of the three parts, there are chapters of theory, each of which ends with several lightly annotated illustrative games.  There are a total of 116 illustrative games in the book.  This format is the best of both worlds for an opening book.  That is, you have your dense theory, and your complete games, but without the drawback that the complete game format used by Everyman and others elimiates exploration of many sidelines.  This little-known book has been a great asset to me.	2003-06-17

This book pretty much describes everything white will throw at you (other than most traditional king's indian lines), including Torre Attacks, Trompowskys, Veresovs, Averbakh, Four Pawns (those last two are the only regular king's indian lines given), Barry Attack, London System, Blackmar-Diemer, and others.  The book has lots of explanatory text and twenty-nine annotated games flesh out the main ideas.  It is a repertoire book, meaning that the book focuses on recommended lines for black.  Burgess' writing is, as always, clear, entertaining, instructive, and witty.  The Batsford production is excellent.  A fine chess book.	2003-06-17

I am intermediate &quot;club&quot; type player, and decided to play the Grunfeld a few months ago.  I already owned the excellent &quot;Understanding the Grunfeld&quot; by Rowson, but wished to supplement this with a more standard opening work as well.  Looking up reviews of Lalic's work, I noticed that John Watson does not think very highly of it.  In his review (all his reviews can be found at chesscenter.com), he noted the high production values, but complained that the book lacked theoretical originality, and that Lalic had not explored several lines that Watson thinks are important.  Finally, I bought the book anyway, despite Watson's negative review, and I am very happy that I did.  The book is beautiful.  It contains 86 heavily annotated games, with a dense mix of variations and constant textual explanation.  It is wonderfully produced and extremely well-written.  Lalic himself says that the book is a labor of love (and that he personally typed in every move), and it shows.  His annotations are constantly evaluating the position and the possibilities therein.  Each time I play through a game, I am glued to it, and drawn in by the quality of the games and analysis.  In short, I am using this book a lot more than Rowson's and I value it most highly.  This experience has made apparent to me a key point about John Watson's chess reviews.  Namely, his reviews of opening books often are aimed at the highest level of player, where theoretical originality and subtlety are what make a book stand out.  I am not qualified to agree or disagree with Watson's reviews of theory, but I have realized that in many cases his critiques are of little or no relevance to the club player who is seeking to understand and learn an opening.  Watson is a high level master, who writes openings books of great theoretical value.  When he reviews books, he is applying his own high standards.  Very few players in the chess-book-buying public will have any concern, however, for theoretical originality.  I, for instance, am not interested in whether Lalic's book adequately explores a theoretical byway that had become important on move 15 of some Grunfeld line.  Rather, I want to learn how to play the Grunfeld Defence.  This book is teaching me that, and it has taught me the importance of putting chess book reviews in their proper light.  Don't get me wrong, Watson's reviews are great, and they are important to me.  It's just that they are not always aimed at me.  This is not to say that I am not a good player, but that many theoretical distinctions that signify originality to Watson are completely over my head and irrelevant to me.  What is important to me is that a book engages me, teaches me, illuminates me, and inspires me.  Lalic's book on the Grunfeld succeeds in all these ways extremely well.  I highly recommend it.	2003-06-13

This astonishingly beautiful chess work is the pinnacle of what chess literature should be, on every level: it is a physically large book (9-3/4&quot; x 6-3/4&quot;) with 248 pages; the pages are laid out two-columns with plenty of diagrams; the annotations are poignant and thematically focused; complete games are given, so that one may see the connection of the opening to the endgame.  Volume one investigates open and semi-open games.  The book is arranged by opening, beginning with the Sicilian Defence.  Shereshevsky is a natural teacher, as anyone familiar with his classic work Endgame Strategy knows.  This is not an endgame book per se; rather, it brings you complete games, with the endgame always in mind.  For instance, it is generally true that in the Sicilian Defence the short wins go to white, and the long wins to black.  The authors use Sicilian game examples to show you why this is the case, and, in more modern games, why this often is not the case.  So, there is an explicit plan to this book, and each and every game and annotation supports the plan.  This is precisely the type of instruction that the intermediate player needs, in order to expand his overall understanding of chess and the endgame from a strategic perspective.  This is not to say that tactics are ignored.  Indeed, the games presented are tactically beautiful, the idea being that certain strategic plusses lead to tactical possibilities.  The games selected by the authors are wonderful to play through, so this book constantly entertains and astonishes, even as it educates you.  Compared to more recent works, I would compare this book (and volume two on the closed games) to the two works on pawn play by Drazen Marovic.  I consider all four of these books to be indispensable parts of my chess collection.	2003-06-10

I was inspired to throw in my two cents based on the three-star review which faulted the book for having sparse coverage of certain lines.  I don't agree with that review, as 21 pages in this book is still a lot of coverage.  McDOnald packs the book with text and variations, so one feels one can follow what is going on, even in this most &quot;dynamic&quot; (e.g. confusing) of variations.  He is constantly striving to point out strategic &quot;signposts&quot; to help the reader follow the action.  I find this very helpful for my general understanding of chess, as even in hair-raising lines like the Sveshnikov, the tactics somehow are based on the strategic elements.  McDonald does a great job keeping this in mind and in never forgetting that he has an audience that might need help comprehending what is going on.  The font is fairly small, meaning that each page is loaded with material.  I think this is in fact the best book on the Sveshnikov that I have seen, and I have the ones by Krasnekow, Aagaard, and Sveshnikov.	2003-06-09

A wonderful and unique chess journey through Michael Adams career, as told by his father, with all the games annotated by Michael.  Many of his first competitive games are here, and you see him make typical mistakes that we all make, when he was 8 and 9 years old.  Then you see him improve steadily.  It is a marvelous thing to see this type of progression in a book.  Most game collections by GMS just have them destroying other GMs.  This is the only book I can think of that shows a GMs early games, played when he was a mere mortal.  This is not ony very instructive, but somewhere in the book is the transition in play from an intermediate club player to a GM.  The lessons are there for you to absorb.  It is a beautifully written and annotated book.  I think it belongs on everyone's shelf, and that it, along with its sequel, Chess in the Fast Lane, have been seriously overlooked by the masses of chess players.  Because of this, you can get each of them cheap used, and I suggest that you snatch them up while this book can still be found.  Adams comes across very much as a normal guy, and this book, in addition to its inherent strengths, also gives hope to the aspiring player that with hard work, he can improve!  Highly recommended.	2003-05-29

I found this book in my favorite used/overstock store, misplaced in the sports section instead of in the chess section.  Several times I looked through it, and foolishly put it aside because it only dealt with 1. e4 openings, and most of these were things like the Ponziani, the Kings's Gambit, the Two Knights, etc.  I figured that if I wasn't playing these openings, I wouldn't get anything out of this book.  Finally, however, upon seeing the good review here and seeing favorable mentions elsewhere, I took a chance on this book, and going through it has been an eye-popping experience.  Evans brings you through several moves of an opening, giving you choices of three moves to pick at various spots.  In the back are detailed explanations of why certain moves were wrong, and of which one was right.  The explanations are incredible.  They are lucid, poingnant, and highly instructive.  The next diagram will show the same opening a little further on, and ask you to pick a move.  White or black may not have played the right continuation up to that point, and you know this from reading the answers to the previous quiz.  Thus, you start to recognize the appropriate setup in these various openings.  What is even better is that the answers ulitmately have little do with the opening in question; that is, the thinking process you go through is applicable to any opening at all, and this book changes the way you look at openings.  Plus, the positions selected will inevitably occur frequently in your games.  It is ultimately the unique and effective instruction technique that Evans uses here that makes the book so wonderful.  I thought I was reasonably proficient at openings until I went through this book.  I since have realized that I frequently chose the second or third best move.  Evans has opened my eyes andre-dedicated me to the opening.  I consider this book absolutely essential to the intermediate player who really wishes to improve not only his openings, but his analytical abilities.  Finally, the book is incredibly enjoyable to go through.  Working through it I got the same feeling I had going through The Amateur's Mind by Silman; that is, that the instructor was right there with me giving me personal lessons.  You will be very grateful that you bought this book.	2003-05-29

I will say that I occasionally stop playing 1. e4 all together, because I don't want to face the Sicilian.  But this is silly.  Why play chess at all if I am scared of certain lines?  After all, it's only a game.  My point is that when I come back to 1. e4 and try to decide what to play against the Sicilian, I always end up turning to this book by Lane (that is, after I try and drop the Smith-Morra [too gimmicky], the Alapin [too passive], the Grand Prix [too aggressive], and the Closed [too Closed!].  The Bc4 scheme makes a lot of sense, and is consonant with chess principles and chess history (Fischer used it, and he is the closest thing to what Morphy may have been like in the modern era).  Excellent book with a good index in the back and nicely produced by Batsford.	2003-04-15

But I am not sure it adds anything important to chess literature. I could say that about any chess book (and my wife certainly would!), but my point is this: it is one of the many chess books that tries to make its point negatively. That is, its examples say, \\"look, here he didn't see the danger, and lost, etc.\\" There is not corresponding (positive) instruction on how to avoid the danger. Another way of saying this. Say it was a book on war, called \\"Danger in War.\\" It is full of examples showing, for instance, a soldier standing up instead of crouching in his foxhole. He thus gets wounded or killed. This book says, by using examples in this way, \\"see, that was dangerous.\\" This is interesting, but I can easily look at my own games and find plenty of examples of me succumbing in dangerous positions. So, why do I need this book? That said, the examples are good, the writing is good, and the chapter titles (thought-related factors, position-related factors) are interesting, but I can't help but wonder why a book like this does not have more instructional content.	2003-04-10

This is a very good GAMBIT chess book, that presents a repertoire for Black for QGD and the Catalan.  This book is not heavy on explanatory prose, but is very nicely laid out and full of practical suggestions (such as playing 3... Be7 instead of Nf6 to avoid a less favorable exchange variation).  Perfect book to work through with an engine and really learn the QGD and make it your own, on your terms.  Laid out in a detailed graphic way with variation trees, where the last option given is always the main line.  Once one adapts to the intricate layout, one begins to see the typical patterns unfold.  Light bulbs go on in one's head.  This might in fact be the exact way to make opening books.  If you feel an affinity for the QGD as black, buy this one.	2003-04-09

When I read through it, I feel I must be missing something.  It is said that sometimes Buddhist masters smack their students with reeds during their meditations to blast them into awareness.  When I read this book, I want to smack Wittgenstein, to get him to clearly explain to me what the heck he is talking about.  It always seemed to me that you don't have to explain the use of language.  Everyone understands language from the time they know how to use it.  Yes, words refer to things.  We know this intuitively.  The whole process is muddied up if you try to explain it.  I said to my nine-year old boy recently, who is in a smart-aleck stage, \\"watch what you say!\\"  And he retorted, \\"Well, I can't really watch what I say.  You can't see your words.\\"  And I said, \\"HEY! You know what I mean.\\"  And there it is for me.  I like reading this book, because it feels like mental exercise to do so.  But I wonder what he was thinking, because I am not sure what he is getting at.  I took a Wittgenstein course in college that had six students in the class, and I got an A.  I remember being puzzled how I could have gotten an A, since I felt I did not really grasp what W. was saying.  Maybe, as another reviewer recommends, I should just read through it again, slowly and carefully.  It is a perplexing book, but I cannot deny its beauty.  I am glad that I still own my nice hardback copy from college.  The blue and brown books are good too, especially since he wrote at least of them in the trenches in world war I.	2003-04-08

I have been searching for an opening repertoire for my whole chess life.  I keep coming back to this book as most of my answer.  I don't want to play 1. e4 because I hate facing the French and the Sicilian (and for that matter, I am not fond of the Caro-Kann, nor do I like facing 1...e5!).  I am a 1. d4 player, but I have never been completely comfortable playing 2. c4 because I am a control freak and this move cedes control of the opening to black.  He can play queen's gambit accepted, or, alternately, benoni, king's indian, pirc, etc. etc. etc.  I find that playing 2. Nf3 gives me more a sense of control over the opening.  In addition, it is a safe move, furthers development, and sometimes irritates black players of king's indian, etc. etc.   This book by Summerscale is the first place I have found a repertoire that suits my needs.  It is truly amazing how it does this.  It is a well-written book, it is exciting, and it has lots of analysis.  I know I may eventually get to be a 2. c4 player, but I am not there yet.  In the meantime, this amazing book will carry me through.	2003-03-17

In this age of internet chess, where the VAST majority of games played by people are blitz games, it is more important than ever to get out of the opening in good shape.  These two books by Kallai are the absolute best opening books that I have, because not only do they set out variations and plans for all major lines in ALL openings, but they also have odd but frequent second and third moves in all major lines as well.  For instance, in the queen's gambit section, you can quickly and easily find the Albin and Chigorin lines dealt with.  Far too often, books do not discuss these very common second moves by black.  But this book has it all right there.  Have you ever seen an opening book explain why white does not play the exchange variation of the queen's gambit immediately on move three?  This one does.  Kallai tells you succinctly that white wants to wait until black plays Nf6 so that the exchange can be followed up with Bg5.  It is all there.  I have read Sadler's book on the queen's gambit, and although he has that question-answer dialogue, he does not address many of the practical questions that come up, such as the one above.  This Kallai book magically does that.  It is the only book that addresses nearly every opening point you can think of.  I only have one complaint about these books (I did not play nearly full price, so price is not an issue for me): that is, the bindings are total ....  Some Cadogan books were fine, while others fall apart on repeated usage.  On my copies, the pages are beginning to fall out.  This is inexcusable in a $... book.  But, nonetheless, these books are the best.  I use them more than Nunn's Chess Openings, more than Fine's Ideas Behind the Chess Openings, and more than all other opening resources that I own.	2003-03-11

First, there is a tremedous introduction by Yuri Averbakh himself, where he annotates some seminal games in the variation, and explains how the final move order was achieved.  Second, the Averbakh is a great variation (Bg5 on the 6th move, delaying Nf3).  Third, you will get to use it a lot, as many black players play the King's Indian.  Fourth, the book is brilliantly done, with tons of analysis and commentary, involving all major lines you will see (each chapter, which discusses a line, as a hlepful conclusion at the end).  Fifth, at 128 pages, the book is not overwhelming, but it is just the right size.  Just a great book, I have been very happy with it.	2003-03-10

Marovic writes with passion, but not in an unbridled manner. He is always a perfect blend of intensity, variations, text, and enthusiasm.  This book on the King's Indian is great.  I love these Pergamon books from the '80.  They were beautifully produced, they had sections covering variations, and each chapter had several illustrative games, and there is a nice index at the back.  Sounds simple, right?

I took a chance on this when I found it somehwere on the 'net for six bucks.  I now consider it the best six bucks I ever spent.  Clarke is an astonishingly good chess writer.  He lays out plans and ideas behind moves better than anyone else I have read.  I had no idea he was so good.  After going through about four of the games in this book, I quickly bought his book on Tal.  I figured if anyone could make sense of Tal's games to me, it was Clarke.  I was right!  Anyway, this book on Petrosian is such a joy to go through and study, that I cannot believe it is out of print and relatively unknown.  To the mass of club players who enjoy reading Silman, Nunn, Purdy, Stean, Harding, etc., this book should be on your shelf, even though you probably don't know it.  In my 400+ book collection, I rank this one among the top five, along with Edward Lasker: Chess self-tutor; Kasparov's The Test of Time; Stohl's Modern Instructive Masterpieces, and SIlman's Amateur's Mind.	2003-03-06

I love all of his works, and am sure that there are many chess fans out there who would love this book if they could only see it.  There are lengthy explanations of the ideas behind the Modern, viewpoints of it, pro and con (for instance he quotes at length from a work of Akiba Rubinstein (1926) explaining why finachetto openings are not good.)  I have never seen this type of frankness in a book like this.  He really explains it well, and then shows how things work in many of his own games.

Clarke is a phenomenally talented chess writer, whose annotations are an instructive as anything out there in the whole of chess literature.  If you are into chess books, you need his major works.  His Dover book, 100 Soviet miniatures, is great too.<BR>The reason that Clarke's writing is so important is that Petrosian himself never annotated a collection of his own games.  This is a great loss to the world of chess players, because to many players, Petrosian is the modern incarnation of Nimzowitsch.  Petrosian worshipped Nimzowitsch, and prophylaxis was the bas is of his play.  More than any other champion, Petrosian constantly sought to limit the options of his opponent.  Importantly for the fan of Nimzowitsch, Petrosian played in a more modern era than Nimzo, and so he faced all the openings that Nimzo never faced (Benonis, Benkos, modern Sicilians, etc.).  Nimzo lived long enough ago that we see many somewhat bizarre openings played in his games.  If you wonder what Nimzo might have played like in the second half of the 20th century, the games of Petrosian are as good a place to look as any.  His games need a great annotator to flesh them out.  Clarke is up to the task: he is a truly great writer and annotator.  Colin Crouch also is a great chess writer, and his study of Petrosian and Lasker, \\"How to Defend in Chess,\\" is a masterpiece.  This book by Clarke is, in my opinion, of monumental importance to chess literature.	2003-02-25

Some will argue with the idea of a book of &quot;positional&quot; openings all beginning with 1. e4, but really, there is no reason why you cannot play in a more positional manner with e4, and with a more attacking manner with d4.  I think Gufeld's idea is that you are going to be able to control your repertoire better with e4.  1. d4 has so many things to be prepared against, but with e4 you are much more likely to know what you will face.  To wit, you will generally face 1...e5 and 1...c5.  The Scotch Four Knights is a fine opening, and if you study it, you will know it better than black.  Frequently it will reduce to a scenario where you have the two bishops and doubled isolated c-pawns.  The resultant scenario is rich with &quot;positional&quot; ideas, but in an open setting.  Against the Sicilian, 2. c3 may or may not appeal to you, but clearly, it is a good move, and one that does allow you to determine the contours of the game.  Personally, I prefer the Closed Sicilian, and Emms' Attacking with 1. e4 has an excellent chapter on the Closed Sicilian.  The Gufeld book is very well put together, withe variations clearly distinguished with well-placed boldfaced fonts.  Also, with each new line, all the moves to that point are re-written, which is very helpful.  Finally, each chapter has a couple of illustrated games.  I think this is an outstanding book.  I could go on about his recommendations as black too, with the Classical Sicilian and King's Indian being great suggestions.  Excellent book!	2003-02-18

It's not that it's not as good as the first one; it's just that it isn't really necessary if you have the big one.  The problem is that the authors did not really bring the opening canon up to date.  The original work suffered from a lack of many modern openings: the Pirc, Modern, King's Indian, many variations of the Sicilian, etc.  The new one does not remedy this shortfall, although I assumed it would, because it was written in the '50s.  Instead, it basically adds new games that were played in the old openings.

It is a complete chess intructional course in itself; that is how good Marovic's explanations of concepts are.  Everything about this book is wonderful.  There is only one small quibble I have with it; that is, although Marovis is telling you to play the Queen's Gambit, about 90% of the games in the book are wins by white.  Of course, normally black made a mistake at some point after the opening, and Marovic annotates these moments well; however, it does not inspire confidence if you just look at the wins and losses in the book.  That aside, this is the best book on the Queen's Gambit, and I have Sadler's book and Polugayevsky's too.	2003-01-24

His book on the Caro-Kann is also great, if a little dated.  This one is my favorite, though.  It has a great deal of explanatory text and enthusiasm for the Torre Attack, as well as offering a white repertoire for other responses.  The book is realistic (none of &quot;Winning With...&quot; hyperbole, but it conveys the Torre in a fascinating manner, such that you can't help but want to play it.  I have bought and sold hundreds of chess books, and constantly change around the contents of my bulging shelves, but this book is always there.  It is really good and a keeper.  p.s. you can buy Burgess' book on the Torre too, but this one is better.  The Burgess book is more up to date, so it too is essential for Torre players.  But Burgess downplays the Torre against the King's Indian formation (which Varnusz does too), but Burgess doesn't really offer an alternative.  Varnusz does.	2003-01-18

It brims with enthusiasm and with tactics, strategies, traps, theory, history--everything you need to play and love the Tarrasch.  The overview and typical strategies sections at the beginning are beautiful.  Schiller does not sugarcoat this Defence, but he does promise you exciting chess and that by studying this opening your overall game will improve.  It is important to learn how to play with an isolated d-pawn.  Another great benefit of the Tarrasch is you can play the pawn structure against nearly any opening (even against 1. e4 you can play a French and have the same structure.  Even though Kasparov gave up the Tarrasch, obviously it is a worthy opening if several world champions have played it. Solve the problem of the Bc8 being trapped in the most forthright way!

This is an incredible tournament book by Pergamon, from the superior production to the annotations, to the extras, such as interviews with tournament winners Tal and Karpov, to several indexes, to some of Bronstein's chess graphs describing several games. Another reason this tournament is so special is the quality of the participants: Karpov, Tal, Portisch, Larsen, Spassky, Hubner, Hort, Ljuobevic, Timman. There are many positional masterpieces in these games, as well some real excitement. The players annotate many of the games, but others are annotated by other players in attendance: Bronstein, Keene, Chandler, Nikitin, and others. This is one of my favorite books. It looks like the Zurich '53 book, in that the font is typewriter style. It is an oversized Pergamon book, from the era when that company was really using quality materials in its production. In sum: this is a great book, that will entertain and instruct players of all levels.	2002-11-26

There are several Cadogan opening works from the mid-90s that are so far above the quality of most of the stuff being poured out by Everyman since that it is shocking. The Everyman stuff are like the cliff notes, and this book on the QGA by Neishtadt and the two-volume work on the English defence by Bagirov, are like the real deal. This book is 286 pages long (not 224 pages as stated above, plus this is a Cadogan book that has not been re-issued by Everyman), is packed full of thousands of variation, tons of explanatory text, and is carefully laid out with a complete index in the back. Equally stunning is that throughout the book, each variation is carefully indexed numerically, and each variation heading re-states the opening moves up to that point. This feature allows you to re-play moves to that point without having to flip back and forth all the time. This is a variations format book, with tons of games in the notes, but no \\"illustrative games\\" per se. It is a challenging and massive work. Neishtadt is an excellent chess writer. Everything he has ever done is absolutely first rate. Other than this book, I especially love his two books, \\"Winning Quickly with White/Black.\\"	2002-11-22

I have probably 100 openings books, and this one on the Anderssen counter attack (1. e4 d5, 2. exd5 Qxd5, 3. Nc3 Qa5, 4. d4 e5!) is unique, and in some ways puts all the others to shame. I found this book at a used book store recently. It is like a doctoral thesis on the opening. It has a historical section at the beginning in which very mention of the Center Counter Defence going back to the beginning of recorded chess history is meticulously detailed and footnoted. Then, throughout the book, the lines themselves are set out in the columns format, similar to openings encyclopedias like Horowitz' classic \\"Chess Openings: Theory and Practice,\\" and Nunn's Chess openings.\\" Throughout, the footnote references are unlike anything I have seen. For instance, a certain move will have a footnote reference to a Lasker quote from a magazine article from 1912. This book has to be seen to be believed. The font looks like typewriter style, but the book (I have the second edition) is very well-produced. This 1992 edition shows no signs of wear. The book is so great the one feels almost compelled to play the opening. 136 pages, with a detailed index and bibliography at the back. A superlative reference work on a little known variation, that you can play hand have a great deal of fun with. This guy Lutes must be an incredible chess fanatic. Snatch this book up if you can find it if you have any interest in the Center Counter (Scandinavian).	2002-11-22

He does not smirk at white's various lines, such as the King's Indian Attack.

If you play 1. d4, this is, in my opinion, an essential book.  Mednis carefully explains the strategic underpinnings of all the major d4 openings.  He deliberately does not go overboard on tactically heavy openings, because he did not wish this to be a book on tactics.  For instance, there is only one game on the Benoni.  But you know the irony of that?  His one game makes the Benoni understandable, as does his one game in the Benko Gambit (many other games in the annotations).  Many other books have purported to explain the &quot;ideas&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot; behind the openings, but I have never seen a book do this so effectively.  This book far exceeds works in its genre.  For instance, it must be compared to such works as: Chernev's &quot;Logical Chess&quot; and &quot;Most Instructive Games,&quot; and John Nunn's recent &quot;Understanding Chess, Move by Move.&quot;  For my money (literally and figuratively),  &quot;Strategic Chess, Mastering the Closed Game,&quot; far exceeds those other works, for several reasons.  Regarding &quot;Logical Chess,&quot; most chess players consider that book an incredible learning tool for newer players.  It brings chess to life for many people.  However, it has several major limitations: it does not deal with modern openings; it wastes many pages worth of material reiterating the same exact thoughts; its explanations are often quite superficial; and it frustrates in its failure to really explain the more complex moves.  Mednis' work shines brilliantly on all these points: it handles all major modern closed openings; it never wastes ink on redundancy; its explanations are concise, poignant, and always illuminating; and it does not shy away from tactical complexity, althought that is not the focus of the book.   Regarding Chernev's &quot;Masterpieces&quot; and Nunn's &quot;Understanding,&quot; I do not wish to point out flaws in either of those books (Becausethey are both five star books to me), but in one very crucial way, the present book by Mednis is far more important to me than those books: namely, it is focused on the closed (d4) games, so it is a singular treatise on them.  In that sense, it provides a comprehensive course on the d4 openings, in a way that completely prepares you to understand and play both sides of d4 openings (there is coverage of the English, Dutch, and Torre as well.  Of course, this book is not an opening treatise on any particular d4 opening, so it is not a substitute for books on one specific opening.  For instance, if you are going to play the Queen's Gambit Declined, you still will want to have Marovic's &quot;Play the Queen's Gambit&quot; or Sadler's &quot;Queen's Gambit Declined&quot;.)  By contrast, the Chernev and Nunn books are all over the map in terms of openings.  The Nunn and Chernev books contain beautifully annotated games, but the games do not go together as a cohesive whole, as they do in this Mednis book.  This point significantly diminishes the value of those books to me.  Those books contain snapshots of beautiful chess, and they are great books as far as they go; but this Mednis book is a living instructional course on queen pawn openings, and for that it is unique and essential.  Also, the games that he has chosen to illustrate his strategic themes are very beautiful games.  At under ten bucks, this Dover book is one of the best values in the whole literature of chess.	2002-11-21

At first, I only used a couple of the suggestions, but over time, I am using all of them. They all make sense for the club player who does not want to play 1. d4 ( I hate that Benoni/Benko stuff), but who does not want to go into the main lines of the Sicilian, etc., in which your opponent will always have his pet line ready, which he will know better than you. These lines are not the most aggressive, but they are not passive either. The Closed Sicilian and the King's Indian Attack (against the French) are examples of this. The book has one huge advantage over most Everyman opening books: there is one comprehensive index at the back, instead of the ridiculous practice of putting the indexes for each chapter at the end of that chapter. This is the variations format, and is very thorough, there are no complete games. You may wish to supplement openings with specialized books, but it is not absolutely necessary. In each of these lines, you will know the line better than your opponent. You decide which way the game will go. So much of opening play is like that: who is dictating the opening? By playing 1. e4 white dictates, but by playing 1... c5 black dictates Sicilian, but by playing 2. Nc3 white again dictates, whereas by 2. Nf3 black continues to dictate choice of opening. This is a book you can have handy for games on-line and is very useful. This one book can give you one-third of a repertoire (personally, the other 2/3 for me are queen's gambit accepted and Scandinavian, and Aagaard's \\"Meeting 1. d4\\" for my responses to other white openings (1. Nf3, etc.)). Great book by Emms!	2002-11-19

Pick up any of his books and read one page, and you will forget you are reading, and will realize that you are observing your own life, and your own character.  If Krishnamurti is right, that to deeply observe oneself is to solve one's conflicts, than OSHO brings me closer to this than any other author.  But that is not all: his writing brims with love and honesty.  And in this book he is approaching the greatest advocate for love and honesty that the world has seen: Jesus.  It is typical that OSHO studied Jesus; he considered him one the most important enlightened persons in history.  He has no need to deify him, just as he does not need to deify anyone.  That is not the point for OSHO; the point is, rather, for the person to achieve wholeness, peace, and love.  He knows that Jesus is a master who can bring those things to you.  He is without peer in having no apparent prejudices whatsoever, in favor of any established institution.  He is all about the individual, living in the world.  His books have had a major positive impact on my life.  The only limitation on this impact is my own fear of or reluctance to change.  But these books are beautifully written, and will challenge you to move beyond stereotypes, to become who you should be.  And The Mustard Seed is absolutely my favorite book of his.  I feel I should address a point brought up by another reviewer, who was very angry about the \\"anti-semitic\\" comments, in which OSHO suggests that the Nazis were a punisher that appeared for the Jewish people.  It is true that OSHO sometimes strayed a little too far in his analysis.  He occasionally is a bit out there, such as in one of his books when he suggests that the trees become scared if you walk into the woods with an axe.  But it is important to note that he was not uttering anti-Semitic statements per se; he does not hate Jewish people.  Rather, he was attempting to describe (albeit in a very unfortunate manner) the universal nature of the law, that if one sins, somehow one ends up being punished for it.  These occasional excesses should not be seen as diminshing his work.  These books are transcripts of extemporaneous talks he gave; anyone, talking for hours on end will say a goofy thing here and there.  Take my word for it, though, read his books with an open mind, and you will feel your mind opening up and your world expanding.  This is not b.s. new-agey stuff; it is the essence of great spiritual writing.	2002-11-14

IN that sense, these gambits force you to become a much better player, and force you to learn tactics, because if you can't spot  tactics to give you an edge, you will simply be a pawn down!  Schiller's books are alive with energy and enthusiasm.  FOr these reasons, I love this book, and find myself picking it up quite often.  Face it, the Center Counter (and gambit variations) can be a very effective tool as black: he dictates the opening and can be better prepared than white.	2002-11-05

The value of this book is that you can see the struggle of a chess grandmaster as he evolves through his career.  The best parts to me are where he goes through several openings and shows the evolution of his approach to them.  This shows me the kind of work that has to go into opening analysis to come up with one's repertoire.  The frustrations with the book are its lack of a rationale structure.  But is this really a criticism?  Perhaps not, because my frustration with this book is parallel to my frustration with chess; that is, it is hard to find a structured path to take as one's chess evolves.  There is no set way to go, and chess is a very hard subject to really learn.  So, this book is frustrating for its lack of clear instructional content, but very valuable perhaps, in that it shows the achievement of chess mastery for what it is; namely, a difficult and endless path.  Yermo is no Capablanca, that is, chess is not his mother tongue (neither is English, but that's another story).  But again, perhaps this makes his book more valuable than those by Capablanca.  Capa was a magician who, to teach you how to juggle, just says, \\"you go like this,\\" and juggles.  Yermo, on the other hand, takes you through his struggle.  \\"First, I tried with two balls, and eventually got to three, and practiced practiced practices, until then I could juggle a little--see, like this, but then I realized that I had to make this change, etc.\\"  In this sense, the Yermo book is much more valuable than the Capablanca books.  Time will deliver the verdict on this book.  I t may be a classic, or it may just be ambitious.  It is a little hard to tell.  If I get a clearer picture over time, I will edit this review and let you know.	2002-11-01

They published the book more as a \\"trends in...\\", trying to predict where the future play would be in this line. First, there is a historical chapter, which presents with astonishing clarity the main ideas that have shaped the Blumenfeld. Second is a chapter which shows many examples of the main ideas in the opening, focusing on the struggle for d5. This too is a great chapter. yes, the book is short, but it has as much susbstance as much longer books. There are no illustrative games to pad the thickness; but every page of theory shows you something important. They take you through all the main white and black efforts to alter the evaluation of this opening, and and the result is incredible instructive. In fact, this book emphasizes some psychological elements (the author is the author of the recent psych. treatise, \\"How to Think in Chess.\\"), also in a very instructive way. This book istructs you on how to approach any opening, this one in particular, but it is a very valuable book that, instead of giving you a repertoire or a pat series of moves, challenges you to think about the ideas of the variation, and brings you into it to make it yours. A gem.	2002-09-05

Imagine if Capablanca could really write and put things into simple terms that the reader could understand. That is what we have here, as Karpov writes from his throne in the days when his supremacy was absolute. But he never suffered from the arrogance (at least in his writing) that plagues the literature of Capablanca and Kasparov. He tells the story of a game objectively, but chock full of high quality advice. Karpov is the best guy to study, as his games shimmer with clarity, and you can emulate his opening style. Plus, he is a modern player who studies hard, so his openings are not occasionally ridiculous, as was Capablanca's, for instance, in the first game of his disastrous match with Alekhine. He never seeks complications, but always plays solid moves from which tactics logically arise. This is a great, great book. You should certainly buy it. I also own How Karpov Wins by Mednis, Karpov's Best Games by Karpov and the 1976 collection of his games by O'Connell and Adams. I think this is the most valuable of all of them. He was at his peak and most eager to talk, and he knew he would have a legacy.	2002-08-10

Also, if you are like me you may conclude that your opponent is a wimp, a novice, or both.  You may be in a for a shock, as in many variations of the Philidor, black comes out looking better than he does against a Ruy Lopez.  This is because white players know how to get through the Ruy opening, but often have to figure out their way against the Philidor over the board.  I find that this book is really essential, and is very well-done.  In many ways, I recommend this book to all chess players, because there is something so basic to chess theory, and easy to understand, about the Philidor, that it pays to study it.  Plus, you will find many great 19th century games to review which include this opening.  Kosten does a great job making this work entertaining, alive, with his suggestions and recommendations.  A fine job by Batsford. Good bibliography and index as well.  All in all, a great book.	2002-08-06

After hearing all the raves about this book, I have been sorely disappointed in it, for two reasons. First, the production value of Cadogan/Everyman is completely shoddy. This book falls apart on repeated use. Second, and more importantly, the coverage is so slanted toward black that one senses an utter lack of objectivity on Watson's part. He would have you believe, by his annotations, that the most white can ever get is = in any line. There are entire sections of this book where, according to Watson, white cannot even equalize! Look at his Winawer sections; he does not cite a single game where white had an edge. This type of bias has no place in a work that is otherwise of decent scholarly quality. Readers generally rip books that are one-sided, the type of \\"winning with...\\" book that makes it seem that you cannot lose with an opening. Watson does that, big time, in this book. It seems that white has no prayer for more than equality. Such a conclusion is patently absurd. Does black win more with the French than the Sicilian? I think not. Why is the Sicilian played so much more often than the French? The French is fine, but Watson doesn't mention any downside to it in this book. It is all about black having advantages in the main lines. That conlcusion is bogus, as white will always have a slight advantage with correct play by both sides in the main lines of any opening.	2002-08-01

He explains things clearly in a manner that the intermediate player can understand, in a way that can help you improve. This book actually improved the way I analyzed games. And there are many great wins against the world's best players at the time. This book deserves a five-star review, even if Averbakh was not a world champ. How many players can be world champs? Not many, even those who deserve it. Averbakh is a giant of chess.	2002-07-29

I have used this in conjunction with the Semi-Slav book by Sadler.  This book is more of an eopic treatise, and Sadler's has more of the conversational tone.  Not to say that this book is dry though.  This book combines the &quot;tree&quot; type variations analysis with complete games, providing, in my opinion, the best type of opening work.

Much of the book is taken verbatim from those other works.  There are many additional annotated games here, but there is nothing to recommend this book if you have the other mentioned works.  Those other books are still available through various sources on the 'net.  Certainly, Fighting Chess is essential for hardcore Kasparov fans; but The Test of Time alone can keep you occupied for probably a year, so I see little need for this book.  Plus, it is a physically smaller book, unlike the previous Pergamon works, which were the large softcover, double-column format that was so attractive.  In sum, this is a nice summary work of Kasparov's career to '95, but get the other books instead!	2002-07-09

But for the Queen's Gambit Declined, it is the best book in extistence.  perhaps not for Kasparov, because it is heavy on textual explanations, and does not drwon you in variations.

Schiller has been accused of churning out books, but this one comes across as a labor of love.  It is an excellent blend of text and variations, and he really gives you a feel for the Reti opening. There are lots of good reasons to play the Reti; the flexible first move, Nf3; the avoidance of queen's gambit theory; the avoidance of traditional approaches to the king's indian and grunfeld.  In that sense, the Reti allows you to largely call the shots as to the direction of the game.  This book has a special magic for the club player who wants to play the opening--one can get started almost right away, as you do not get bogged down.  In that sense, the book is simpler than many opening manuals.  But there is as much depth as I need, and one feels that one has a coach along for the ride in Schiller.  He has great enthusiasm for the opening, and includes some of his notable wins, but he does not sugarcoat it either.  The book is also very well made and solid, and is a pleasure to work through.  All in all, a great chess book.	2002-05-21

It takes like what, 45 seconds to learn? Chess players are normally pretty smart people, and they have trouble learning descriptive notation? Perhaps chess isn't for you if you have trouble with that. Maybe take up basket weaving, which is very challenging in its own right, but does not use language. This book is one of a treasured few that makes my \\"desert island\\" list. I often felt before reading this book that chess was like a foreign language to me. I heard with envy that Reti said about Capablanca that \\"chess was his mother tongue.\\" I wanted that so badly, but I still felt, no matter how much I studied, that I was missing something essential about chess. This book, Pawn Power in Chess, changed that for me. The more I study this book (which has been off and on for about 5 years), the more I learn about chess, and the more I \\"feel\\" chess on an intuitive level. Kmoch uses the device of creating his own vocabulary to bring concepts to life for you, and I always found this useful, though some readers do not like it. The examples are brilliantly annotated and selected. My only complaint about this book is that I wish it were ten times longer. I wish Kmoch had written about all of the openings, explaining them in light of the principles he sets out in this book. A major part of this book is the incredible conviction that he brings to his work. He brings enthusiasm, which is key, but many writers (Motwani, Silman, Seirawan, Alburt, Watson, Yermolinsky) bring enthusiasm. That in itself is not enough. Great conviction is also required. This is what impressed Petrosian so much about Nimzowitsch: the almost religious conviction with which Nimzo presented his ideas, his system. Kmoch is, to me, on a similar level. In fact, I think this book makes a perfect companion to My System. On top of that, work through Kmoch's earlier works, Rubinstein's Chess Masterpieces and World Championship in Battle Royale (about the 1948 championship tournament), for lots of great games to flesh things out. He annotates those works more conventionally, but those works become more interesting after reading Pawn Power. I cannot say enough good about this book. It can be obtained cheaply, and it should be treasured.	2002-04-29

If GAMBIT publications came out with this book today, with a big double-column format with a nice cover, it would be hailed as a classic.  In other words, this McKay edition is not laid out in the best fashion, but it is a great book, that is ten times more useful than cranked out word processed streams of consciousness like The Road to Chess Improvement or the Seven Deadly Chess Sins.  Those books are a different genre than this.  This book was WRITTEN, with painstaking care, as were books by Reti, Pachman, Nimzowitsch and other greats.  Because they were written out, they are more carefully done than the books today.  Yes, the books today are backed up by computer analysis, but that does not make them more enjoyable to read.  Read the classics of chess literature.  You will see in fifty more years people will still be reading this book, whereas Yermolinsky, Rowson, will be forgotten....	2002-04-16

I contend that Paul Motwani produced more great chess literature in a three year period (1997-2000) than any chess author in history (HOT Chess, COOL Chess, STAR Chess, Chess Under the Microscope and Most Instructive Games of the Young Grandmasters).  His annotations are alive with enthusiasm and insight, are a tremendous combination of variations and text; in short, they have everything that great annotations should have.  But he goegoes further than this, constantly posing challenges to the reader, drwaing comparisons to other positions, and generally inspiring the reader to tacked the difficult subject of chess.  These are all great books, and C.O.O.L. Chess is as good as any of them.  The emphasis is on exploring creative opening lines.  He shows how people have succeeded with this idea of finding your own opening niche and creating something personal for your repertoire.  Finding an opening repertoire has always been a battle for me, and Motwani has inspired me to try things I never thought I would try.  For instance, the French Defense.  I have always hated the French, but Motwani's chapter in this book on the French (&quot;French Connection&quot;) will have all of its readers playing the French.  I cannot say enough about his books.  For those three years, he put out nearly 1000 densely packed pages of high intensity chess literature.  He is like the Beatles at their peak.  The difference is that he has been almost universally condemned by most chess reviewers.  He is too original for them.  For instance, Motwani occasionally mentions God in his writings.  This really rankles chess traditionalists, who contend that chess should not contain any such personal references.  But if you are open minded, and enjoy striking an doriginal chess literature, of a very intense and demanding style, I suggest you gobble up all these books by this genius, Paul Motwani.	2002-03-27

It has been a long four years in the world of philosphical discussion about chess, since John Watson came out with his epic Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy.  Watson's book is a comprehensive look at the elements of chess, as they have evolved since the time of Nimzowitsch.  His book is based on the premise that the old masters were incorrect in thinking that chess is based on rules, which more or less dictate the strategy and tactics to be applied in a game.  I have always thought that Watson's book is a travesty in terms of its logical argument.  It is a great chess book, due to the depth of its discussion, on both an historical and a substantive level, but his whole philosophical argument about the nature of chess is ridiculous.  The whole argument that evaluation of a position must be based on concrete analysis rather than the application of rules is a truism in one sense, and false in another.  In any field of knowledge, there are general rules or principles.  For instance, when driving a car (in the USA), there is the rule that you should pass on the left.  But if there is a snow plow traveling at 5 mph in the left lane, the \\"concrete analysis\\" dictates that you should pass on the right.  Similar to this argument, Watson presents old rules such as \\"don't move a piece twice in the opening,\\" and then presents specific examples to show that a player did the right thing by moving a piece twice in the opening. This is so Mickey-Mouse and simple an argument that it is amazing that Watson's book has received the acclaim it has.  However, the present book, Excelling at Chess, is the first systematic attempt at refuting Watson's argument.  Aagard likes Watson's book (as does everyone apparently), but he points out that general rules of positional understanding do often dicate the correct strategy to follow in a game, even though of course any ideas must be verified by concrete analysis.  This is obviously true, and it is refreshing to hear someone say it.  There is no question that Watson went way overboard with his arguments.  The Aagard book is an excellent, entertaining read that is full of insights into chess, what makes a great player, the competitive aspect of playing chess and improving, and many other issues.  It is everything I love in a chess book.  If you like The Seven Deadly Chess Sins, Watson's book, The Road to Chess Improvement, and that type of book, you will like this one too.

Depending on which option you pick, you are referred to a different section of the book. That new section will tell you if you picked the best move. If you picked the wrong move, it referes you back to try another choice. But even on the wrong choices, Lasker goes to great lengths explaining to exactly why it is not the best move. He presents variations of likely scenarios to make his point. He does this in a style that instructs, enlightens, and informs, always referring you to general principles to follow. Then, when you finally pick the right answer, you are presented with the next problem, which logically follows from the prior one. As a result, you gradually work your way through the book. There are large sections on the opening, the middlegame, and the end game. This is the greatest chess instruction book I have ever seen. Unlike so many chess masters, Lasker is a brilliant writer as well. His style is articulate, patient, and comprehensive. He does not \\"dumb-down\\" to you, but presents things more clearly than I have ever seen in the whole history of chess literature. He published this book when he was 84 years old! It has the feel that he wanted to sum up his life's work in chess in a manner that would leave a legacy to the aspiring player. Well, he did an amazing thing for chess players: he poured himself into this work with a sincerity and devotion that is unparallelled in chess history. His career was so long that he played against Em. Lasker, Capablanca, Nimzowitsch, and Alkehine, and here he is analyzing Bobby Fischer's famous 5. 0-0! in the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez. Lasker is the Bertrand Russell of chess: a man who lived for 95 years, who saw the richest epoch in the development of chess, and who knew how to assimilate it and summarize it in an instructional format that would be of maximum value to the student. This is that rare work that demands hard work of the student, but constantly inspires you to continue tackling it. You will emerge from its hallowed pages a far stronger player. This is a stupendous work, that for some reason is almost unknown. If I had one book to take to a desert island, it would be this one. I could go on and on, but you get the point.

By comparison, for instance, My 60 Memorable Games by Fischer does nothing for me--the annotations are dry and two-dimensional.  As an average player but avid consumer of chess books, I am attracted to books that bring chess to three-dimensional life.  Silman's books come to mind as classic examples of this.  My System by Nimzo. is perhaps the greatest example of this (with quotes such as &quot;the passed pawn is a criminal which must be kept under lock and key&quot;).  I need chess brought to life, because I get bogged down and bored by books that emphasize variations at the expense of explanatory text.  Now, to the text at hand.  I repeatedly find myself turning back to this book Action Chess.  It is pure Purdy, talking to you the reader about opening principles, and about his search to find manageable systems.  Whether the lines he selects hold up perfectly to modern analysis or not, the point is that we can follow this journey through opening ideas in a manner that is rich with imagery, enthusiasm, and Purdy's infectious chess excitement.  And I enjoy the margin comments as well, by Ron Wieck; they are very instructive.  The production is excellent and the book feels very good to leaf through.  This is a very fun book, that in the scheme of things deserves far more than one star.  The fact for me is that I have over 250 chess books, and for better or worse, this is one I find myself studying quite a bit, while other supposed &quot;classics&quot; go un-opened.	2001-12-03

Books	1	23	69	N	N	Gaudy quackery with some good moments	&quot;The time for thinkers has come,&quot; said Mary Baker Eddy. What she meant was, &quot;the time for the Thinker has come, and the Thinker is me. The rest of you do not have to think, I have done that for you.&quot; The book has its moments, but the fatal flaw with Christian Science is that it entirely neglects the entire tradition of Christianity which preceded it, and relies instead on the absolute authority of this one person Mary Baker Eddy. Ask a Christian Scientist if they have heard of The Confessions of St. Augustine and they will say no, because it wasn't written by Mary Baker Eddy. This book has some interesting points about not relying on the body, or matter, to solve what are fundamentally spiritual problems. But Eddy and her cultish followers decided that if you were a true Christian Scientist you would not use medicine or traditional health care at all (but even she realized that if you had broken bones or teeth you better go to the doctor because &quot;Science&quot; can't seem to heal those right away--this exception alone proves the absurdity of her &quot;religion&quot;; that is, God can dissolve a big tumor but he can't seem to crown a tooth or set a broken finger) Because of this, Christitan Scientists all get nailed when any type of flu epidemic breaks out, and they drop like flies from cancer and heart attacks when the rest of society enjoys the benefits of modern health care. But they don't talk about their deaths, instead they tend to ignore them. Do you know that in the Christian Science church service not a single spontaneous word is spoken? The entire service is scripted by the church authorities. In other words, no one is allowed to &quot;think&quot; because they might say something in conflict with Eddy or the Church. Keep that in mind when you read this book, that it was the start of something truly warped in the world, Christian Science. Read Confessions instead, or The Practice of The Love of Jesus Christ by Liguori, or The Imitation of Christ by Kempis, or countless other works that have withstood the test of time, and leave aside this quacky thing that was big in the early 1900s but has been slowly dying ever since, as all falsehood must eventually.	2001-08-24
