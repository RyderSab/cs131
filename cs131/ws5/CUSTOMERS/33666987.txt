US	33666987	R29BR7JDRNIX82	0195102746	636432032	Religion and the Order of Nature	Books	3	8	33	N	N	Intriguing, but flawed	Nasr's basic premise in this book is that the current ecological crisis stems from the fact that, about the time of the Renaissance, a large portion of humanity abandoned its traditional religion-based view of nature as a living and sacred creation of God, in favor of the view that nature is a dead machine that humans may manipulate however they choose.<br /><br />Already, at this point, the reader may feel a bit uneasy--justifiably so, in my opinion. Nasr's reductionism leaves him reluctant to point out the substantial differences in the views of nature held by what he considers traditional religions. His stance is that all these religions (such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism) sprang from a common source and were appropriate for those times and places in which they manifested themselves. He believes that only by a mass return to the perennial philosophy embodied in these religions can the planet be saved. Not surprisingly, although he displays a broad and thorough knowledge of many of these traditions, his favorite is his own, Islam, which he considers superior.<br /><br />Anyway . . .Nasr has some sound notions about ecology and philosophy, but his prejudices are pretty evident. His work is made a little less accessible than it might be for me personally by his references to himself as one of the top authorities in his field, and by his consistent use of the editorial \\"we\\" and \\"our\\" to refer to himself and his work. (Or is that the royal \\"we\\"? With him, it's a little hard to tell . . .)	2005-05-13

Charlie is one of the best in the business, so Gallagher Cole feels privileged to sign on such a competent new employee for his heli-skiing company. Gallagher feels privileged, that is, until he discovers that Charlie is (horrors) a woman. Then Gallagher feels betrayed, cheated, disgusted, and extremely justified in attempting to show her the door. Not to mention full to the brim with a kind of righteous indignation that will leave most readers wanting to show HIM the door . . . <br /> <br />But Charlie puts up with this incredible macho hang-up/attitude because she really needs the job. Charlie's life, unbeknownst to her surly employer, basically revolves around caring for her developmentally disabled 22-year-old cousin, Kenny. <br /> <br />After a suitably tense interlude, Charlie gets the job, but now she's got other problems: Kenny is beginning more and more to move toward an independence the overprotective Charlie is reluctant to grant, and Gallagher is turning out to actually have a heart. What's a girl to do, especially when she's already had her own heart broken once, and when she also must face the fact that devoting yourself to a loved one doesn't mean you stop having dreams of your own?  <br /> <br />While Charlie's smothering attitude toward Kenny may be pretty grating to most contemporary readers, there's a profound message in here about how love is translated into everyday acts of caring and courage.	2005-05-03

Returning to her childhood home four years after her irresponsibility led to her beloved younger brother's death, Ria must face the fact that her wounded family has fallen apart. Reeling from guilt and running from herself, Ria seems to want only to provide a safe haven for her young son. But in reality she yearns for the forgiveness she has not yet learned to grant herself. <br /> <br />Like its prequel, this is a powerful story. It is only slightly diluted by the fact that some passages are repeated verbatim from \\"Coming Home.\\" One of its strengths is a much greater role for Sandor, whose love helps Ria find her way to forgiveness.	2005-05-03

The first part is quite tedious, as Nickie, the heroine, is called home to testify in the divorce proceedings initiated by her first love, Miguel, against his wife (via an arranged marriage) Marieli. But (HUGE, GIGANTIC SPOILER) the divorce is actually a plot between Miguel and Marieli, who both want out of the marriage. So they get out, and Nickie and Miguel get together . . .

In this \\"Soulmates\\" story, Ellie (Marlie's sister, from \\"Marlie's Mystery Man\\") is a pediatric nurse who goes to Hawaii to attend a medical conference and visit with her brother before he leaves on his latest military assignment. <br /> <br />While in Hawaii, Ellie meets Daniel, a (relatively) nice, attractive guy who has the strange habit of unexpectedly disappearing for no reason, much to Ellie's irritation. <br /> <br />Except that of course there is a reason, which the reader is let in on pretty quickly: on a visit to Hawaii a few years earlier, a young and arrogant Daniel went around acting like a clueless jerk just long enough to totally annoy the local spirits, who therefore punished him by imprisoning him in a truly ugly tiki statue on display in Ellie's brother's neighbor's yard. No, really. <br /> <br />Daniel can leave the statue only when Ellie wears the plumeria-shaped earrings given her by her very strange grandmother, whom some readers will probably remember fondly from the previous book. So the dilemma becomes finding a way for Daniel to escape the statue permanently, without Ellie's having to wear the earrings permanently.  <br /> <br />Frankly, this story didn't really grab me; both Ellie and Daniel are mildly irritating, and the temptation is to wonder exactly why it's so important to rescue this guy, anyway, since it isn't particularly obvious that years inside an ugly statue have improved his personality any. The ending also takes place in Africa, and feels rather tacked on. <br /> <br />BUT, the third star is for a couple of well-written and beautiful scenes, which basically are worth the price of the book.	2005-05-02

The plot concerns the pain and recovery of a family which has fallen apart after a daughter's decision to drive drunk costs the life of her adored younger brother. When this oldest daughter shows back up years later, teetering on the razor-edge of starvation and despair, with a child of her own in tow, chaos erupts and old wounds are reopened.    Specifically, this book focuses on Cleo and Malcolm Channing, the parents who deal with their prodigal daughter's return, and the growing awareness that, despite divorce and tremendous anger and pain, their own love has never completely died.    This book is not by any means a light read, but it is realistic and powerful--and worth your time. Especially memorable is the fact that the lead couple are grandparents!	2005-05-02
US	33666987	R3EJFNZBEYQSPV	0152024654	12224394	Odder Than Ever	Books	1	7	23	N	N	Abysmally bad	After checking this book out at the local library, I was so disgusted I sent them the following letter to urge its removal from the YA section:  <br /> <br />I am very disturbed by the content of a Young Adult Fiction book I recently checked out. I strongly feel that you should consider removing it from the shelf, since some of the ideas it presents could be harmful to young adults at very vulnerable times in their lives. The book is Bruce Coville's short story collection titled _Odder Than Ever_. While most of the stories are simply strange or funny, the last three promote clearly negative and shortsighted ideological agendas. <br /> <br />The story \\"The Japanese Mirror\\" concerns a boy who has trouble controlling his violent temper, until the day he sees a strangely distorted version of himself in an old mirror. His outbursts of temper start to radically diminish, through no particular effort on his part, but every time he does not become violent, his anger is transferred to the monster in the mirror. The monster becomes stronger and stronger, until at last the power of the boy's repressed anger allows it to break free to wreak havoc. At this point the boy learns that in order to stop the monster, he must accept it and love it, and welcome his anger back into his own soul. While there is indeed something to be said in favor of healthy expression of emotion, I am disturbed by this story's message because it presents a false dilemma: either the boy must lose all control of his anger or he must wholeheartedly embrace it. Nowhere is a third choice presented, the possibility that the boy might learn other, more mature responses to the situations that have provoked his outbursts of anger. <br /> <br />The second disturbing story is titled \\"Am I Blue?\\" This story promotes an incredibly intolerant and narrowminded attitude toward people whose values may differ from one's own, and advances a number of stereotypes. In the story, a boy struggling to understand his own developing sexuality is visited by his fairy godfather. This fairy godfather practiced homosexuality in his lifetime, and died as the result of a hate crime. He enables the young central character to see the people around him in terms of the strength of what the author posits as homosexual tendencies or degrees of gayness. Those who exhibit such tendencies turn different shades of blue depending on the strength of their tendency. This story is offensive on a number of levels. First, it presents a radically oversimplified and distorted picture of the results of the choice to engage in homosexual behavior. Second, with its odd notion of homosexual tendencies, it presents the totally false idea that some people have no choice whether they engage in homosexual behavior or not--in other words, it suggests to young adults that their lives are more controlled by heredity and environment than by the choices they make. Third, the story advances dangerous and intolerant stereotypes. It implicates the totally specious equivalence of artistic talent with homosexual tendencies, and most insulting of all, clearly suggests that the only reason a person would object to homosexual behavior is because he or she is violently suppressing his or her own desire to engage in that behavior. This is ridiculous logic; the fact that I object strenuously to murder does not mean I am violently suppressing a desire to kill someone. <br /> <br />But it is the last story whose ideas have, arguably, the most potential to cause serious harm to young adult readers. In \\"The Metamorphosis of Justin Jones,\\" the young protagonist manages, by supernatural means, to escape an abusive homelife dominated by an alcoholic uncle. At the end of the story, though, his magical benefactress convinces him that he must return to live with his uncle, instead of staying in the refuge he has found. At first sight, her reasoning seems sound; she tells Justin that if he stays away he will never develop spiritually and emotionally into the loving man he is meant to become, a man who will help other children. So, of course, Justin makes the \\"heroic\\" decision, and returns to his abusive uncle. The problem with that \\"heroic\\" decision is this: it implies clearly that the decision to leave an abusive home is somehow immature or inferior. It could easily influence a vulnerable young adult reader not to report abuse, and/or to needlessly remain in an abusive situation because the suffering is seen as somehow redemptive in and of itself. Such a decision to stay or keep quiet could also endanger younger family members, and perpetuate the cycle of abuse. <br /> <br />Because of the emotionally and spiritually dangerous messages presented in this book, I strongly urge that it be removed from the Young Adult collection. <br />Thank you for your consideration. <br /> <br />Basically, avoid this book. Joey (above) hit the nail on the head.	2005-04-18

Noel thinks she's safe--after all, no guy could be that good, right? <br /> <br />Enter Nicholas Baranov, a gorgeous, brilliant and honorable Russian physicist whose political dissidence and personal heartache work together to make him ready and willing to leave his homeland, even if it means marrying some unknown American woman who obviously can't get a husband any other way. <br /> <br />Now take Nicholas and Noel and dump them right in the middle of the plot of a John Denver-type Christmas movie, as an evil mining consortium schemes to take over Noel's rural Montana hometown, and you've got this book. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable little Christmas tale, whose main flaw is that all the characters, with the notable exception of Nicholas himself, are drawn larger than life and a bit stereotyped, which gets slightly annoying at about the 150-page mark. But Nicholas himself is admirably humanized (despite his many sterling qualities) by a tender background story and a touch of gritty realism that shows during some of his episodes of culture shock.  <br /> <br />The other thing which stands out is the absolute power and memorableness of some of the more intimate moments between husband and wife. Definitely consider adding this book to your list of romantic Christmas reads.	2005-04-17

Our heroine, small-but-determined Janey, gets a construction job on a site run by Blaze, our hero. Janey is bent on proving that Blaze was responsible for her father's financial and emotional ruin several bajillion years ago.  <br /> <br />Now come the two mildly annoying aspects for twenty-first century readers: Blaze's typical tough-guy persona leads him to vocally and pointedly express his contempt and dislike for the very notion of a woman on a construction site, and Janey's equal-rights-or-die attitude flares up in response. Frankly, many readers in the year 2005 will have a little trouble relating. <br /> <br />BUT, three things stand out very much in this book's favor. First of all, a couple of the minor characters are very deftly and sensitively drawn. Second, the handling of suspenseful elements strikes a balance I really appreciated but have seldom found: there is mystery here, but you won't be biting your nails to the quick, and little of the tension results from miscommunication or jumping to conclusions (the kinds of things that can wear a reader out so quickly!). Last but not least, the conclusion is so tender and memorable that your only complaint is likely to be that it rushes by too quickly.  <br /> <br />Check this book out--it just might surprise you.	2005-04-17

This is the story of Lucy Guerin, a young math professor who finds herself stranded by bad weather over Christmas at the home of reclusive furniture-maker Richard Banner. Stranded with them are a rather predictable crew of supporting characters: an elderly, salt-of-the-earth couple, a single mother with two small children, and a good-hearted truck driver. They provide themselves with exactly the kind of makeshift holiday romance readers probably expect, and Lucy and Banner struggle with the fact that they are slowly growing more and more attracted to each other.  <br />Banner is a deeply wounded hero, and when past hurts prompt him to try to distance himself from Lucy despite the fact that they've already begun a pretty intense physical relationship, Lucy eventually decides it's up to her to make the infuriating man see reason. <br />Though I generally particularly enjoy Christmas romances, I was fairly dissatisfied with this one, and it took me longer than usual to figure out why. Although the characters' emotions and motivations are discussed in this story, their beliefs aren't. I think that was a good part of what was missing. That lack makes them seem less realistic and a little two-dimensional, despite the information given about their pasts. <br />The third star, though, is for the \\"Twenty Questions\\" game Lucy and Banner use to get to know each other Fun!	2005-04-06

This story can be divided into several parts: <br /> <br />Part One: Aurora Fairhurst, a spoiled socialite, heads off on a wilderness expedition to escape an arranged marriage set up for her by her manipulative father. The reader begins to entertain a faint hope that Aurora might get eaten by a bear. <br /> <br />Part Two: Aurora meets professional wilderness guide Chance Cody, who does a fair imitation of an Arrogant Jerk. The reader figures out Chance's secret identity and wonders what on earth is taking Aurora so long. The reader entertains a fervent hope that both Aurora and Chance will be eaten by bears. <br /> <br />Part Three: Aurora and Chance exchange the kind of insults that, nowadays, would get Harlequin sued for a million dollars by Canada's First Nations political activists. Aurora and Chance also sling innuendo back and forth with all the subtlety of dueling banjos. The reader begins to worry that the bears might get indigestion. <br /> <br />Part Four: Chance begins to attempt to be a gentleman, with intermitent success. Aurora grows up. Aurora falls in love with Chance. Chance starts to fall for Aurora. The reader breathes a mystified sigh of relief, flips back to see if (s)he might have skipped a few pages, and decides to let the bears off the hook. <br /> <br />Part Five: Chance and Aurora Get Serious. Chance embarks on a life of crime by picking some wildflowers, leading to a scene so wonderful it's worth buying the book for. Chance and Aurora spend the night together, and they are not sitting up trading recipes for peanut brittle, either. The reader flips back to the wildflower scene. <br /> <br />Part Six: Everybody goes home. Aurora's father reforms. Chance shows up, and his secret identity is revealed. Aurora is shocked. The reader is not. The reader wonders if the story wouldn't have been a bit more fun without the secret identity. <br /> <br />Part Seven: The author throws in a totally unexpected curve at the end of the sort that Harlequinsnever have anymore--more's the pity. The reader is very glad (s)he gave up on the bears.	2005-04-06

Second, Des himself has a notion in his head that all women are ultimately unreliable, so he makes some weird assumptions and says and does some (frankly) stupid and cruel things.

In this final installment of the \\"In a Fairytale World . . .\\" series, enchanted princess-turned-resort-manager Merry Montrose finds her own True Love with (not surprisingly) Alexander Rochelle,resort-owner-in-disguise. <br /> <br />Except that Alexander is really Prince Alec, the guy Merry has been betrothed to all this time. But SHE doesn't know that.  <br /> <br />The disappointing part is that Alexander, who was shaping up to be a pretty decent guy in the previous books, here morphs into a cynical, critical, short-sighted, self-centered jerk. He constantly puts the worst possible spin on Merry's motives, and has an incredibly high opinion of himself. Meanwhile, Merry has developed a conscience, so it's even harder to imagine her paired with him. <br /> <br />Also irritating is the plot device of the curse Merry is under; here, every time the lead couple gets close to working something out, Meier introduces a new aspect of the curse to foil their plans. THAT gets old really fast. <br /> <br />So--read this if you're dying to finish the series. And remember: they lived happily ever after--sort of.	2005-03-09

It's the story of Brandy Mitchum (Joe's ex-wife, from \\"Lightning\\") and her \\"soul mate,\\" oil well fire fighter Trick Templeton. Both Brandy and Trick must overcome a fear of commitment before they can get together. <br /> <br />Despite the reappearance of both Celestian the creative angel and Joe and Brandy's precocious daughter Chloe, I didn't enjoy this story very much. It lacked the humor that livened up the other two, and it was hard to sympathize with Brandy in quite the way the author intended, because, having read the previous books, I still felt enormous sympathy for Joe! Also, the theme of reincarnation is given a bit too much emphasis here. Trick's workaholic attitude and flippancy about affairs also bugged me. And the emotional connection between him and Brandy seemed mostly based on his efforts to recapture the best parts of his lost childhood. <br />All in all, you won't be missing much if you skip this one.	2005-03-07

Having been raised by her ex-Marine father, she scorns anything that might hint of weakness or traditional feminine roles. On a photo shoot in Hawaii, while trying to recover from the disastrous ending of her one and only romantic relationship, Sid meets Danya Stepanov, whose huge, warm, traditional family is the antithesis of just about everything she is familiar with. <br /> <br />So far, so good. Sid and Danya are almost immediately attracted to each other, but while Danya decides they were meant for each other (and proceeds to inform his family that that's the case), Sid is considerably more wary. In spite of herself, though, she is slowly drawn toward Danya and his family's welcoming warmth. <br /> <br />And here, unfortunately, is where it gets weird. When Sidney, confused and insecure, finally does up and leave, Danya, who had up to this point been determined to aim for nothing less than marriage and a lifetime with her, suddenly changes his tune and starts talking about \\"taking what he can get.\\" <br /> <br />But it gets stranger still. When Sidney's father and sisters show up in town to check on her, Danya persuades all three to temporarily move in with the Stepanov family and experience the joys of the settled life. This works for long enough to get Sidney's attention, but despite the interest of a couple of spare Stepanov cousins, her sisters are soon gone again. Her father sticks around, but the whole episode is strange. <br /> <br />Then Danya undergoes yet another personality shift, and suddenly decides he's had it with Sidney; he spends most of the last part of the book being terribly angry and hurt, despite the fact that their bizarre situation (with her flitting in and out) is a good deal of his making. <br /> <br />Then somehow they solve everything, in one of romance fiction's wimpiest endings, of the sort that my freshman composition teacher in college thoroughly despised. <br /> <br />Final word: what started off as a great story ran out of steam in the middle and ended with a whimper. <br />	2005-03-07

Then one day he wins fifty million dollars . . .  Convinced that he is meant to use his new wealth to benefit others, Briny quickly decides he needs help to navigate the treacherous waters of upper-crust Dallas.  Enter Dorian Burrell. Dorian is pretty desperate for a job; she has just overspent her very generous allowance yet again, and her oil-rich grandmother has temporarily cut off Dorian's funds to teach her a lesson. After some persuasion, Dorian accepts a job: she will tutor Briny in etiquette, culture, and image, so he can successfully put his new status to work.  But behind the frosty facade she presents to the world, Dorian is lonely and painfully insecure. So it's not too surprising that Briny winds up teaching her, too--about the power of selflessness, the strength of friendship, and the joy of love.  Recommended.	2005-02-16

Also great fun is Jack's sophisticated and outspoken half-sister. <br /> <br />On the minus side, the sexual relationship in this story starts before the wedding, and really, the last-minute conflict feels very rushed and artificial. <br /> <br />All in all--some treats and some tricks in this Halloween promo.	2005-02-15

A few words about this book:    1) If it walks like a vampire, talks like a vampire, and sucks blood like a vampire, it is a vampire, whether it spouts deep philosophy and bad poetry or not.    2) Trying to fob responsibility for the fate of your immortal soul off onto another person is not attractive.    3) You get no brownie points for not getting blood on the carpet while killing a bad guy.    4) The fanatical vampire hunters trying to kill off the protagonists are the most misunderstood people in this book. Personally I think they are a group of ex-English teachers, trying valiantly to bring the protagonists to justice for brutally murdering the English language. If I never see the phrase \\"brush of butterfly wings\\" or the words \\"mesmerizing\\" or (especially) \\"honey\\" again, it will be too soon. For supposedly multilingual immortals, Dayan and his buddies would make truly atrocious Scrabble players.    5) I strongly advise that you do not actually spend money on this book; if you do, you will soon be hunting for a convenient stake to use on yourself.	2005-02-09

Cassie left town and eventually had a baby, Jake left town to a communal sigh of \\"good riddance,\\" and Tess grew up,got engaged to an up-and-coming politician, and joined the local Historic Preservation committee. <br /> <br />Now Jake is back in town, and all bets are off. <br /> <br />Jake has decided to restore his mother's old house (did I mention that Tess is on the Historic Preservation committee?), but he is hindered by the fact that much of the town still sees him as the wild child of a no-good father. Tess blames him for deserting Cassie and his child. But wait--the reader is immediately informed that Tess is mistaken; the baby wasn't Jake's, no matter what the general consensus among the town's gossips is. So, the frustrated reader will immediately ask her/himself, why in the world doesn't Jake clue Tess in to this important fact as they grow more and more interested in each other??? <br />Well, Jake has his noble reasons, but they are very convoluted ones that don't hold much water. Tess doesn't figure out till about 130 pages in that she should hunt Cassie up for a chat. Once that is done, everything gets straightened out.	2005-02-08

(If there ever was a place where they needed to get some religion . . .) <br /> <br />Terribly injured both physically and emotionally as the result of a past construction accident, Rick is more at home in nighttime darkness than in the light of day. Bitter about romance and relationships in general, he is reluctant to get involved with Cynthia, whom he had known briefly when they were younger. But a plan to steal a midnight kiss as revenge for her youthful desertion of him goes seriously awry as Rick discovers he still has feelings for her. <br /> <br />Cynthia meanwhile spends nearly her whole time at the resort realizing that she's had enough of her mother's emotional manipulation, that it's time for her to get her own life, and that having a real romance (albeit with a man she can't see), is much better than reading torrid romance novels.  <br /> <br />But the pivotal question, inevitably, is whether this nighttime romance can stand all the revelations that the light of day will bring. <br /> <br />This story has much more depth than any of the previous ones in the series, as the development of the plans for the chapel parallels the characters' emotional development, and as the \\"fairy tale\\"--in this case a Native American myth--actually plays a part in the action. And if Cythinia occasionally seems to go off the deep end, throwing out the baby with the bathwater in her attempts to forge a more mature relationship with her mother, and if both she and Rick occasionally seem to be quoting pages from New Age self-help manuals, you'll mostly be inclined toforgive 'em. The story's just too good not to.	2005-02-07

Maggie Todd is a high school custodian (how cool is that for a romance heroine?) who volunteers her time for a charity auction. A potential client makes Ethan a deal: if Ethan can \\"make over\\" the decidedly unglamorous Maggie so that she will be fit for high society, this client will help rescue Ethan's business. Ethan buys Maggie's time, and takes on the challenge. But he soon discovers that not even business success can make him very eager to really change sweet, tough Maggie, who can repair anything--maybe even Ethan's wounded heart. When a surprise revelation suddenly catapults Maggie into \\"high society\\" for real, Ethan must find a way to convince her that he loves her for who she is, not for what position she holds. <br />Four-and-a-half stars; a sweet and memorable story marred only slighty by getting a bit lurid in places, as Maggie contemplates Ethan's, ahem, romantic expertise.

Hurt and terribly insecure, Cam simply reacts without explaining any of his reasons to Alex. <br />Alex decides to sacrifice her job and accompany her husband, thinking that a slower pace might help them recover some of the closeness they've lost. But life in the small town of Korbin Lake is far from ideal, and the two grow farther apart as Cam struggles to learn his new job and Alex faces the prejudices of the area's long-entrenched medical establishment.  <br />There is a happy ending here, as a marriage is resurrected with the support of friends and family, and the changing of some life-long attitudes. But this book is wonderful because it's so realistic; one character thinks that love without communication is not enough, but I would put the message a little differently: certain kinds of love simply can't survive without communication. <br />This story is further enriched by two \\"subplot\\" romances, each powerful in its own right; Alex's brother, Wade, finds love despite the havoc wreaked on his life by a spinal injury, and Cam's brother, David, finds that love is the motivator that is powerful enough to help him grow up and decide what he wants from life. <br />Recommended.	2005-01-28

When Griffin's ex-wife threatens his growing relationship with Casey, both Griffin and Abby must confront feelings that are surprisingly powerful. <br />This is a remarkably good story despite its rather formulaic-sounding plot; it showcases a love that's willing to give whether it gets anything back or not.	2005-01-25

Maggie Sullivan, a slightly shy, slightly lonely social worker, first (literally) runs into Luke August at the hospital one day, when Luke is having a wheelchar race with a young cancer patient. Luke, a self-confessed daredevil and adrenaline junkie, frequently endures hospitalizations for injuries sustained in pursuit of the ultimate thrill.  <br />Well, the mutual attraction is immediate, and since both are scared out of their wits by it, both react defensively: Maggie runs, and Luke lies. Of course, the lesson's pretty clear; Maggie has to learn that the rewards of love are worth its risks, and Luke has to learn that loving Maggie will provide him with the greatest thrills of his life. <br />I liked most of this story; the point was (mostly) good and the humor was great. It is a keeper for me. But I was disappointed that the sexual relationship came before the marriage--not only is that flat-out backward!, but here the (brief) sex scenes also basically didn't add much to the story. And I understand that this book is part of a continuity, but I really wondered about the inclusion of \\"pseudo\\" health professional Dr. Richard Strong: although much is suggested, his story is left unresolved, and provides a strange \\"loose end\\" in the book.	2005-01-21

But while Greg's being forced to reevaluate his life, he's also falling for Lily Sullivan, the emergency room nurse whose hesitant interest in him gradually transforms into a love that has the potential to last long after his hospital stay is over. <br /> <br />While I hardly consider this story top-notch entertainment, I was taken by the relationship between Lily's brother Kaleb and her friend Frannie, a gutsy social worker. Hutchinson is also to be commended for her sensitive portrayal of Lily and Kaleb's love for their grandmother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease.

Having agreed to babysit his eighteen-month-old half-brothers, while their mother is out of town, Dylan goes to a charity auction, hoping to hire a no-nonsense grandmotherly type to help him. Instead, all his protective instincts come to the fore, and he winds up hiring high school teacher April Pruitt to save her from the unwanted attentions of another man.    April has her own issues with childcare; a failed romance and subsequent miscarriage have convinced her that her mother was right: love and passion are dangerous ingredients which should be kept out of relationships. As a result, she has created a computer program which she is using as she attempts to find the man who is \\"scientifically\\" right for her.    But April agrees to help Dylan, and slowly they both fall for the adorable toddlers and for each other.    It's the kids--and April and Dylan's evolving relationships with them--that give this book much of its punch. On the downside, there's a lot more sexual fantasizing here than I'd have wanted, although there's very little followup on it.	2005-01-17

You'll find yourself rooting for everybody on these pages, and that's saying a lot. <br />Those who enjoy this story would probaby also enjoy three similar books by Cara Colter : \\"A Hasty Wedding,\\" \\"The Heiress Takes a Husband,\\" and \\"A Bride Worth Waiting For.\\" All three feature heroes who have hearts for troubled kids, having been troubled kids themselves. And all three are exceptional.	2005-01-13

But when those same relatives call in Harry Jones, cutthroat financial advisor and son of Madison's grandmother's romantic interest, are they doing it because they don't trust Madison, or could they have a little matchmaking in mind? <br />This book's a bit hard to get through--the pacing's erratic, important information pops up out of nowhere, and the eccentric relatives don't get as much character development as they should. Plus, Madison's major insecurities are not fully explained til the last four pages or so of the story. It's also just kind of crude in places. Skip it, I'd say.	2005-01-10
US	33666987	R2XZWZU6L1UT8K	0373682425	175950906	Aprender A Amar (Spanish Edition)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	A terrible translation of a wonderful book	I am so disappointed in this translation it's almost hard to know where to start. But first things first:  1. The original edition of this book was Cara Colter's \\"Major Daddy,\\" a book I truly love, which is probably why the awfulness of this translation into Spanish galls me so much.    2. I am a literary translator. I have a degree in it, and I've done a lot of it. I know it's never simple, and even the most uncomplicated-looking passages can hold dense layers of meaning.    3. This is not really a translation--it's an ABRIDGEMENT.    However, all that said, this book is a badly-mangled attempt to transmit the soul of a beautiful story. It's like replacing the diamond in your engagement ring with a cubic zirconia, for crying out loud. It has several huge problems.    First, a lot of things are simply omitted, and I'm not talking about insignificant details here, either. The worst omission is that of the story of Thomas Edison and his assistant, a story which, we're told in the original, served as a guidepost for the hero (Cole) in his compassionate treatment of people (like the heroine, Brooke) who had made mistakes. Also omitted is much of the related discussion of the fragility of the human spirit, the importance of gentleness, and the ways mistakes can make or break people. This is some of the profoundest and most beautiful stuff in the original, and to take it out removes depth from Cole's character as well.    Also omitted is the grandmother's commentary to Brooke on the relationship between coal and diamonds, with Cole's shining spirit being the treasure hidden in an unlikely place, just as diamonds are hidden in coal mines. This is  a totally unnecessary omission since the translator does take particular trouble to explain the play on words between \\"coal\\" and \\"Cole.\\" Many small humorous touches are omitted, as well, but I particularly missed Kolina's cryptic and sweet purple-crayon messages, completely taken out.     Worse than all these omissions, though, are two major mistranslations at critical moments. The first occurs during Cole and Brooke's second kiss, a scene which, to me, was one of the most touching and powerful in the book because of the emotional impact it has on Brooke. During the kiss she realizes that the power of Cole's love for her is such that it can help her become someone different--it can draw out all the potential locked in her spirit and help her become who she was meant to be. The Spanish translation destroys this entire scene simply by changing the tense of the verb; in the Spanish, Brooke does not see herself as becoming a confident, sensual, beloved woman, but as ALREADY BEING all those things. The power of love to transform is thus played down severely.    The second horrendous mistranslation can't be attributed to anything but carelessness, but it too destroys a scene that is critical to the plot. Toward the end of the story, Cole returns home alone, wounded, cynical, and feeling that he has lost Brooke. The original English reads very much like this: \\"He decided that it was impossible to call a bird to land on your shoulder . . .However, he could lure them as far as the edge of his deck . . . .\\" Calling birds from the trees had been a gift possessed by one of Cole's ancestors, a result of the man's gentleness of heart. Giving up on acquiring this skill is, for Cole, tantamount to giving up on love. However, the Spanish translator misread the passage, and apparently misunderstood the disillusionment and pain it was meant to convey; the Spanish reads approximately: \\"He decided it was not impossible to call a bird to land on your shoulder . . . In fact, he had been able to lure them as close as the edge of his deck . . . .\\" Need I say more? Mission accomplished. Scene destroyed.     This isn't the only instance of such blatant mistranslation, though it's by far the worst. The upshot of all this? Please don't judge either Cara Colter or \\"Major Daddy\\" by this shoddy Spanish rendition. READ THEORIGINAL! !LEAN LA VERSION ORIGINAL! !!POR FAVOR!! Harlequin should be ashamed of this mess.	2005-01-05

But--not so fast. <br /> <br />Yes, Anna Kane has amnesia. Yes, she is dismayed to learn that she is apparently married to Simon, who seems wary and suspicious of her. (Think early Leclaire hero here: tall, dark, handsome, autocratical, and arrogant.) As it turns out he has his reasons--apparently Anna left him on their wedding night, without a word of explanation. As Anna slowly comes to trust, and eventually love, her mysterious and bossy husband, she has to ask herself why she would have done such a thing. <br /> <br />Well, love can make us do weird stuff, as Anna finds out during the unravelling of a surprisingly complex plot. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, though, while poor Anna is sweating out every twist and turn of an impressive cliffhanger, it's easy to be fascinated by the scenery, culture, and history of the imaginary but captivating Caribbean island which Simon's pirate ancestors have inhabited for generations. If poor Anna has to go through all this angst, she's at least got a marvelous setting to do it in! <br /> <br />This book is like a mini-vacation; nobody would want to live this story, but it sure can be fun to \\"visit.\\"	2005-01-03

Since it is mostly set just after World War II, this will be a good read especially for anyone who, like me, loved Elsie Larson's book \\"Dawn's Early Light,\\" but was terribly disappointed in its sequel. \\"Forbidden\\" strikes me as more like the sequel that should have been written. <br />Those who enjoy \\"Forbidden\\" would probably also love \\"Dawn's Early Light,\\" which takes place slightly earlier. I cannot remember the title of the sequel, whose entire plot seemed to run counter to the main truth affirmed in the first book, but I do remember that the sequel was written under the name Elise (or Elyse) Larson.  <br />As for \\"Forbidden,\\" it's a thought-provoking and enjoyable read; I did, though, notice that even major doctrinal differences occasionally got glossed over.	2005-01-03

This book, actually titled \\"Getaway,\\" is a collection of three short Christmas stories, none of which is very good. The three stories chronicle the Christmas getaways of three women who meet by chance while stranded in an airport because of bad weather. The three, Kayla, Greta, and Megan, decide to meet again after their vacations to discuss how things went.  <br /> <br />How things actually go is spookily similar: each meets up with a man who is initially reluctant to get involved with her, each has a Christmas affair, and each receives and accepts a marriage proposal. All three heroes are remarkably shallow and self-centered; all three sleep around.  <br /> <br />The differences: Kayla (whose story is hardly a Christmas one at all) winds up sharing a beach bungalow in the Virgin Islands with her best friend's brother, who was her own girlhood crush. She quickly decides it's her Christmas mission to seduce him. Ick. Greta winds up with her deceased husband's brother, who decides it's his Christmas mission to help her be less straitlaced. Apparently \\"straitlaced\\" now means wearing clothing that actually covers you up moderately well, and not getting drunk. Ick again. Megan meets the nicest of this sorry group of heroes, a craftsman from Tennessee who makes it his Christmas mission to see that she doesn't actually manage to escape Christmas, as she had originally planned. Very slightly less ick. (All right, all right, it's actually Lucas' very sweet proposal to Megan which earns this book its second star.)  <br /> <br />All told, this is very substandard Christmas stuff. More sex than romance, by a long shot. And not very good for the heart. Skip it.	2004-12-23

When she arrives she meets Lucien, who has come because of a similar note he claims to have received from her. Could the Cupid Committee be up to its matchmaking shenanigans again? <br />Well, of course it could. But even the Cupid Committee probably couldn't have predicted the bad storm that rolls in, stranding our star couple, or the tree that falls on the line shack, destroying almost everything and trapping Raine and Lucien in a large hole (conveniently without most of their clothes, which were washed away by the storm).  <br />From this dubious beginning (I mean really, folks, settling mysterious notes is what we have phones for) things head mostly downhill. Our stranded lovebirds get carried away (again!), Raine gets pregnant, and they spend the rest of the book hashing out the various difficulties which have kept them apart--mainly a dispute over some land, and the fact that Raine blames Lucien for killing her grandfather. These conflicts are revealed in fragmentary and confusing ways, and it's only in the last ten or so pages of the book that the reader actually learns all of Lucien's supposedly noble and self-sacrificing motives for keeping Raine in the dark on several important issues. <br />Noble and self-sacrificing or not, Lucien, like Raine, is pretty self-centered. This book lacks the intrigue of the first book of the trilogy, and it lacks the humor of the second. A few moments of humor are provided by the antics of Raine's dog and Lucien's horse, but they're not enough to rescue this book. For a deeper read that touches on many similar issues and features a cowboy hero who really is one, try Margot Early's \\"The Truth About Cowboys.\\"	2004-12-20

While the beginning was intense and absorbing, the pace of the action seemed to flag somewhat in the middle.

This story has a lot in common with its prequel, \\" In the Market.\\" It, too, deals with the love that grows between two people who must juggle the competing demands of business and personal lives. It, too, features a larger-than-life hero whose intervention rescues a heroine whose business problems are basically consuming her life. In general I found Thor to be a slightly more complex and engaging hero than his brother Rainer had been, but as a heroine, Andrea seemed more dependent and maybe impulsive than her friend Jordan. A special part of this book for those who loved Leclaire's short story \\"A Man for All Seasonings\\" is the first appearance of a young, brash, womanizing and charming Joe Milano.  <br />One problem with this book is that the reader, like the heroine, gets confusing mixed signals about what the hero really wants. And I personally found some of the business details a little beyond me. But the description of Thor and Andrea's traditional Norwegian wedding was beautiful, and the jokes which arose from Thor's constant additions to the vows were great. A nice read.	2004-12-04

This is the story of Jordan Roberts, who works with her uncle in the small produce market which has been in their family for years (Leclaire writes from experience here), and Rainer Thorsen, whose family owns a large chain of such markets and is determined to buy the small market Jordan loves. When even her most valiant efforts prove fruitless against the business rival who has stolen her heart and threatens to take her beloved business as well, Jordan has to decide just what family loyalty means, and just how much she can trust the \\"Viking\\" who has stormed into her life. <br /> <br />Generally this book's really enjoyable. Rainer is, like many Leclaire heroes, larger than life, but unlike some of them, his personality has a well-drawn tender side that makes him appealingly human. I didn't appreciate his casual attitude toward the possibility of an affair, but since they don't ever actually have one, it's not too distracting. Plus, there are just times when his and Jordan's mutual stubbornness seems a touch excessive, as if they could have solved their problems much more quickly if they'd really wanted to.

No, Alessandro is neither as charming nor as likeable as his brothers in general. But this story will grow on you; it's one of those books that can touch you more the second time around. <br /> <br />Fleeing painful memories associated with both a traumatic childhood incident and a bitter divorce, Alessandro Salvatore holes up in his family's mountain cabin to escape Christmas hoopla. But he hasn't been there long before a woman shows up, a beautiful, exhausted woman with a child in tow. The woman informs Alessandro that her name is Lauren, and that the little boy was born as the result of a two-week affair that Alessandro had with Lauren's sister about a year before. Lauren has brought the child to his father because she needs help taking care of the little boy; her sister has died of a brain tumor. <br /> <br />Now, unfortunately, comes the weak part of the plot: Alessandro was in a car wreck around the time Lauren says the affair took place, and he has suffered from limited amnesia. In other words, he really has no idea exactly what happened during that time in his life. But instead of just telling her that, he simply denies her version of events, and goes on denying it for quite some time, suspecting her of being a golddigger. All this denial goes on despite the fact that Alessandro is troubled by a recurring dream involving an intimate relationship with a woman whose appearance gradually changes to match that of a photo Lauren has shown him. <br /> <br />Alessandro gradually begins to fall for Lauren and little Nicky, and eventually admits that he can't remember the time in question. But now he's also haunted by a new feeling of guilt: are his growing feelings for Lauren disloyal to the memory of her sister Meg? <br /> <br />Gradually, too, Alessandro begins to realize that Lauren is harboring some painful secrets--secrets which his dreams and his returning memory hint at. He must figure them out in order to find herwhen she leaves at Christmas--in order to have a future with the woman who has been so much a part of his past. <br /> <br />Amazing ending--Worth your time.	2004-11-30

Don't get me wrong; I have no serious quibbles with this harmless little romance, but it's awfully yawn-provoking, and won't do a lot for your Christmas spirit. <br />The plot is utterly straightforward: Michael Gallagher is an undercover narcotics officer on paid leave because a random act of kindness has suddenly made his face too recognizable in Chicago. He leaves town, and winds up snowed in at a charming little inn in Wisconsin, an inn partially owned by single mom Angela DiRosa, with whom he falls in love. What could be sweeter than that? <br />Unfortunately, any number of things. The story's main conflict is provided by the fact that Michael is somewhat less than up-front about his occupation, and Angela can't stand men who lie to her (as her ex-husband did). Well, frankly, you know from page one exactly how that's gonna play out. And I do mean exactly.  <br />Also, De Vita has the annoying habit of telling things, informing the reader of emotions and tendencies without letting the characters' actions carry the story. And strangely enough she is VERY repetitive; she tends to use the same words and phrases over and over, and often  to have two statements in a row which mean the exact same thing. That is not so annoying the first fifty-six times it happens, but when you get to the eighty-ninth time . . . <br />In De Vita's favor, Emma, Angela's daughter, is sort of fun.

The \\"contests\\" between the prospective brides are great, as is their growing friendship. I have a couple of plot complaints, including one pre-wedding tryst that goes too far, and the fact that one major conflict toward the end is basically swept under the rug, but there's a lot of good stuff here.

Whew, do I have problems with this book! The plot sounds promising enough: a rich, kind doctor falls for a poor, good-hearted employee at the resort run by Merry Montrose, the enchanted princess who must match a certain number of couples to break the spell she's under. Unfortunately, the final product is kind of awful. Diego, the hero, is a cynical, selfish jerk interested mainly in sex til about page 160. Ruthie, the heroine, is a dingbat. There is simply no other word for a woman who will drag her ailing mother-in-law across several states to accept the dubious services of a doctor she located on the Internet, ignoring the extremely intelligent advice of a large number of other doctors until about page 162. <br /> <br />Truth to tell, I've also got one other serious problem with this silly little book. Each installment in this series is supposed to be based on a classic fairy tale. The first book was based on the story of the ugly duckling, for example. And this one? It gives a rendering of the story of Ruth and Boaz in the front. While I'm thrilled to see that story get the attention, it's definitely part of the Old Testament, and therefore no fairy tale. <br />	2004-11-23

Here's the thing: I really liked this book the first dozen or so times I read it, and then I started thinking . . . This is a sequel to \\"Who's Holding the Baby?\\", starring Luc Salvatore's irrepressible younger brother Marco. Marco goes as a guest to the Cinderella Ball made famous in the Fairytale Weddings series, and unexpectedly meets Hanna, his soulmate. Hanna was abandoned as a child, and has all kinds of issues, and works hard to control her world through charts and schedules. Marco sets out to prove to her that there's a better way to live, opening her heart to love, etc. The problem? When Hanna does not develop a trusting nature as fast as Marco thinks she should, he walks out on her. The jerk. It does not help that he claims to be doing this to force Hanna to make a decision. It doesn't even help that Hanna eventually passes his test. His incredible arrogance basically shipwrecks this story, and not even his incredible charm offsets it. The second star is for glimpses of the other more sensible members of his family.	2004-11-23

Jesse and Molly could easily have been stereotypical, but they weren't. Life had dealt them both raw hands, but they hadn't lost the ability or the will to love. \\"Home for Christmas\\" on the other hand, didn't do much for me; Seth and Olivia jumped the gun by winding up in bed when they barely knew each other, and to tell the truth, I didn't much like either one of them. And Olivia's father's scheming was no real surprise. As for \\"Hark the Harried Angels,\\" it was great, one of the best Christmas stories I've read. The details were vivid, fun, and well-researched, and the whole crowd of minor characters had been fleshed out enough to be real. And who could resist the mysterious Clouet sisters, the coolest angels ever? I especially liked that this was a romance story that aimed at the heart, concentrating on a couple's growing emotional attachment as much as on other aspects of their relationship. This was a story about hope, good to read when you're a little short on it.	2004-11-17

First of all, they're both college professors, an unusual premise for a Harlequin. Second, Nicky, our hero, is passionate about his work in environmental sciences, and about '70's sitcoms. He also has a well-hidden poetic streak. And the INS agents aren't so bad either. <br /> <br />On the irritating side, the hero and his daughter have escaped from the fictitious country of Byelukrania, whose culture appears to be an unlikely mix of all that is worst about the Arab world with all that was worst about Soviet Russia. And the hero's daughter, Anya, is a second-grader who talks like a sixteen-year-old in therapy. And everybody lies a lot, in pursuit of their various goals.  <br /> <br />This is, all in all, a moderately good story. But to see this plot done better, check out M. J.

Even Carolyn Zane, who can often be counted on for great humor, fails us here. (The second star, though, is earned mainly by Penelope, a gutsy and witty minor character of hers.) One of the things that most disappointed me here was the lack of follow-through in character development; for example, despite a few indications that he could be an intriguing and complex character, the main bad guy turns out to be your basic not-very-bright thug. A similar problem occurs with the heroine's father in the first story. . . <br /> <br />Plus, there's just nothing very Christmas-ish here at all. Skip it.

When he unexpectedly finds himself caring for his baby niece on (extremely) short notice, businessman Luc Salvatore turns to his super-efficient (but secretly baby-adoring) secretary Grace Barnes for help. The forced proximity and stress (police and social workers are determined to treat the baby as abandoned) cause Luc and Grace to begin to acknowledge their feelings for each other.  <br />BUT . . . <br /> <br />Grace is actually a woman on a mission, having made a secret deal with Luc's father: if she can work with her charming (and unfortunately, womanizing) boss (Luc) for a year without falling in love with him and flubbing up the work situation, a feat which, so far, no secretary has been able to accomplish, Luc's father will feel comfortable enough to retire, and will set Grace up in her own business. <br /> <br />The sudden appearance of baby Toni causes a major glitch in her plans. <br /> <br />This story is great fun, really, and I'm sorely tempted to give it five stars. I would, except for a couple of scenes where people start shedding clothes, and except for the fact that it takes our hero about four-fifths of the book to decide he really would prefer a marriage to something, ah, considerably more temporary.

However, that said-- <br /> <br />Blake and Holly are wonderfully likeable characters whose growing feelings for each other are beautiful and believable. This story showcases Cara Colter's willingness to explore motivations and bring together many small details to create an unforgettable picture.  <br /> <br />By the way, a misprint in my edition of this book renders the whole joke about the name of the ranch (on page sixty-something) totally incomprehensible.

Little does this tough soldier know that a tiny knock on his door one winter night will change all that, entangling his life with those of five children, their lovable grandmother, and most of all, their movie-star mother's personal asistant (and also their adopted \\"aunt\\") Brooke Callan. <br /> <br />Brooke is quickly attracted to Cole's strength and competence and good looks, but it's his patience, his obvious love for the children who've invaded his world, and his gentle heart which hook her for good. And Cole soon finds he wants nothing less than forever with Brooke.  <br /> <br />But Brooke has been hurt before, so she agrees to let her beautiful boss put Cole to the test, to find out what kind of man he really is.

He's proven it with books like Crash, Loser, and (most of) Stargirl. So what in the world happened to him here??? Both of the main characters here are incredibly immature.

And a couple of Spinelli's much more likeable minor characters, such as Megin's \\"adopted grandmother\\" Emilie Bain, are hardly developed. What GOT INTO Spinelli here?

This is definitely NOT the first book you want to give an aspiring young writer. It does have some good info on the publisher-author-editor relationship, and a few interesting quotes, but it has a number of serious problems. <br /> <br />First, the organization of it is very frustrating. Nothing proceeds logically. <br /> <br />Second, it's unclear what age group is targeted. In one breath the author is unsure whether her readers know what paragraphs are; in the next she's talking about hiring a lawyer. <br /> <br />Third, some of the recommended reading is wildly inappropriate for most kids. It ranges from strange New Age stuff to out-of-date science to Huysmans. <br /> <br />Fourth, the book is primarily aimed at British kids, and Grant's attempts to internationalize it fall short. <br /> <br />Fifth, Grant is just plain not very encouraging. If I were a young person just starting out, this book wouldn't do all that much to encourage me to explore writing further, or think of it as very potentially enjoyable. <br /> <br />In all, this book could be somewhat useful to a young person who's been writing for a while. But for a beginner--no, really for anybody--the book of choice is Stephen Tchudi's \\"The Young Writer's Handbook.\\" Do what you have to do within the bounds of sanity and legality to get hold of THAT! <br />	2004-10-23

This is a good story, and a definite keeper for me, but there is not quite as much optimism as usual, and there aren't quite as many revealing smal details.

Ok, frankly it takes an author of Cara Colter's skill to make a plot like this worth your time, but she has indeed done it.

But years later, with her young daughter in tow, Jordan travels to the tiny island nation of Penwyck(e) to help her aunt cater a royal celebration, only to (very nearly literally) run into her child's father, the heir apparent, Prince Owen Michael Penwycke.

But-- <br /> <br />Mitch Hamilton is a hero like a couple of others Colter has sketched: the bad boy turned successful lawyer who uses his street savy and compassion to help kids living the life he has escaped. Brittany Patterson is a departure for Colter, though; Brittany is a semi-spoiled rich kid whose basically good heart has just never had a chance to show itself. Her development in this story is handled amazingly well, as she proves her own strength to herself and others, and learns a poignant lesson in honesty as well.

This is the story of a love that grows between Abby, a struggling single mother who's been burned by romance in the past, and Shane, a widowed ex-policeman struggling with the tremendous guilt generated by his perception of having failed his first wife. As some reviewers have remarked when talking about the other two Wedding Legacy books, the circumstances that bring the characters together do seem farfetched, but two aspects of this story are particularly worth your notice. First, Shane is different from many of Cara Colter's other heroes, in that he doesn't understand his own motives as quickly as many of them have. This gives his character depth and a little more edge, and insures more character development. Second, I am impressed with the treatment of Shane's memories of his first marriage--like A Bride Worth Waiting For, this story affirms that there can be more than one beautiful love in a lifetime. This story also again showcases its author's talent in portraying young children.	2004-10-08

The hunt for the deranged serial killer and all the minutiae of police procedures took up most of the book. It is pretty obvious who the villain is early on, and your initial guess will be right, but confusing irrelevant details seemed to drag the story down. Also,there was sex here, yes, but in my opinion very little romance. Interactions between Jesse and Delilah were mainly based on guilt, lust, and anger. The story featured few glimpses of their \\"off-the-job\\" lives. I liked the last couple of chapters and the epilogue, but found very little to enjoy before that.

This book is really a rather humdrum effort which doesn't do much to showcase Ms. Linz's particular talents. The plot is utterly predictable, and after Rad's initial visit to the grade school, the humor level plunges--a big disappointment considering what this author's capable of. Even the usual pokes at the military mindset don't help much. The story is livened up slightly by the presence of the Polish grandmother, but this is basically one to skip. Plus, it's somewhat racier than most Silhouette romances.	2004-09-27

Normally I get aggravated at people who review a book without having read the whole thing, and though I'm guilty of that here, maybe this will serve as a warning to somebody else considering it: This book is corny and doesn't live up to its back cover copy. The synopsis would lead you to believe that the hero is a good guy who will help the lonely and misguided heroine discover the important things in life. BUT--she can't think of much but sex and her multiple marriages, and he can't think of much but sex and his past sexual exploits. Irritating, to say the least. Plus there is the bizarre portrayal of all the residents of the fictional town of South Fork, Arkansas, as nineteenth-century hillbillies. I live in Arkansas, and strangely enough, I have indoor plumbing, I don't have a horse in my front yard, and I don't know anybody who believes in \\"ha'nts,\\" goes to wise women, or makes bread without the aid of a bread machine. In short, if the actual town of West Fork, Arkansas, wants to sue Handeland, it will probably have a pretty good case. Skip this book if your irritation threshold is low.	2004-09-27
US	33666987	R3PLLKVYYINXVV	0061084441	309806053	Tallchief	Books	4	21	21	N	N	Worth it for most folks	I won't rehash the plot here--that's been done plenty in previous reviews. This book contains some pretty rough language and a few scenes of quite graphic violence. It actually tops McCall's book Legend for violence. BUT--if Legend left you with the frustrating feeling that it was a little shallow or lacking in detail, Tallchief won't fail you that way. <br />Tallchief's strength, basically, is that it, like Jackson Rule, tells a story that we all hope deep down in our hearts is true. We all want to believe that when life backs us into a corner, like it has Kathleen, there will be one place we can go where we will be protected, forgiven, and most of all wanted. Kathleen finds that place. <br />McCall's sensitive portrayal of Morgan's newfound relationship with his daughter Trish is another mark in this book's favor. One other side note: this book is bound to appeal to anybody who likes Linda Howard's MacKenzie saga (yes, Morgan is that kind of hero) and will be a special treat to those somewhat disappointed by the hero's arrogance and dishonesty in A Game of Chance.	2004-09-27

This book is very funny, and in that sense just what we've come to expect from the Brubaker Brides series. But frankly it's low on both plot and romance, with most incidents feeling like they were basically contrived to help string the sparkling one-liners together. Also, for my tastes, we get too much information second-hand, through flashbacks, overheard telephone conversations and the like. The weird minor character Scruggs doesn't add much but weirdness, and the pacing of events is awfully erratic. For better reads, try a couple of earlier Brubaker books: The Millionaire's Waitress Wife and Tex's Exasperating Heiress.	2004-09-23

Okay, I'll be the holdout here; I just didn't really enjoy this book that much. It's the first Kristin Hannah book I've read, and will probably also be the last. Yes, all the characters are flawed and real, but the truth is that they have so many weaknesses and problems and issues that for about the first three quarters of the book they nearly drove me crazy! I just didn't LIKE these people much at all, and the story seemed very dark. The last quarter of the book becomes more hopeful and focused on possibility, but by then these folks may have worn you out. And even though I am a recipient of donated tissue myself, I found it pretty hard to empathize with some of Angel's fears.	2004-09-18

When Shayla Morrison is asked to deliver her neighbor's three-year-old son to his uncle's ranch in Montana, she has no idea how much the trip will change her life, as it allows her an escape from her unsatisfying job, her smothering (almost) boyfriend, and her fanatically controlling mother. Nor does she expect that her initial fascination with the boy's uncle, rugged, independent cowboy Turner MacLeod, will turn into something much deeper and more precious. Throw in a mayhem-minded Appaloosa and a match-making sister, and you have a thoroughly entertaining mix. I personally don't think Nicky's the most realistically depicted three-year-old I ever saw, but the author more than compensates for this flaw by her deftness in handling Turner's growing awareness that independence sometimes isn't all it's cracked up to be.	2004-09-15

But Sadie, once brash, fast-talking, and clad in black leather, has transformed herself into the perfect polished business woman, all in an attempt to prove to the town that scorned her that it has misjudged the girl from the \\"wrong side of the tracks.\\" <br />Life has other plans for Sadie, though, and she soon finds she could use some help dealing with three grieving children, a kitchen fire, a broken hand, and a visiting pony. Enter Michael O'Bryan, volunteer firefighter, across-the-street neighbor, and the man who's never forgotten the brightness of Sadie's spirit since their brief time together years ago. Gradually Sadie learns that it's love that makes you belong somewhere; it's not how well you seem to blend in.  <br />This is a marvelous sequel to Baby in Blue--it once again highlights Cara Colter's ability to make the smallest things carry great meaning, and reminds us that \\"God has a soft spot for big girls too.\\" Highly recommended.	2004-09-14

But at the risk of irritating its other reviewer to no end, part of its appeal lies precisely in that babies-daddies-families direction! And I unapologetically love that about it! Hawk Adams is a hard-edged, huge-hearted, big-city police officer trying, with limited success, to adjust to the vagaries of small-town life in Sleepy Grove, Idaho. Kate Shea is the town \\"psychic,\\" a widow whose ability to \\"see\\" missing people has helped the local police more than once. But when two local girls go missing, and Hawk is forced to work with Kate, his cynicism threatens to derail things from step one. Only being unexpectedly stranded with his baby niece could bring this tough cop around so quickly! This is a sweet, funny romance, low on trauma, with a surprisingly profound message about the power of love and kindness, and of believing in other people. There really isn't anyone else like Cara Colter for creating heroes I'd really enjoy being with! Note: This book is the \\"prequel\\" to Husband in Red.	2004-09-13

I found this book by following up on recommendations from other books I'd liked, and I wanted to like it too. But it really doesn't deliver. It gets the third star solely because of Ingermanson's believable, sympathetic, and downright fascinating--though frustratingly brief--portrait of Paul. At the same time, it has three major problems. <br /> <br />First, don't look for much science here. The discussion of the theological implication of the arrangement of quarks is great, but only about two sentences long. Other than that, you mostly get high-sounding jargon.  <br /> <br />Second, the theology is just plain weird. Ingermanson takes fiendish delight in trying to prove that most everything you ever learned about the early church is biased and wrong, and that obvious agenda gets REALLY ANNOYING after a while. Plus, he succumbs to the temptation, unfortunately pretty common in this subgenre, to present Jewish people as a sort of para-church group who retain something of their Old Covenant status as the chosen people of God under the New Covenant, without reference to a relationship to Christ as Redeemer. This is a pretty ironic weakness considering that Paul himself tried hard to correct this misconception. Maybe Ingermanson corrects this impression in his following books? <br /> <br />Third, unfortunately, Ingermanson's writing is weak. Character development in this story, when it happens at all, is oddly sporadic and has little connection to the events of the plot. Common sense is in woefully short supply among all the characters, from our hero who jaunts back into the past with an unbelievably small supply of his vital allergy medication, to our villain who was incredibly slipshod in his prep work, to our heroine with her remarkable cluelessness about gender norms in the period she should know so well. Some plot elements test your patience more than they should, too. Excuse me--even if you really could build a wormhole in your local physics lab, could you really use a cell phone while standing in it? In my building, cell phones won't even work in the elevators, folks! Also, assuming you build said wormhole, do you really think the Israeli government's immediately going to believe you can use it for time travel? (The whole government was apparently pretty blase here.) And even if they do believe you, do you really think their first concern is going to be whether your cool new technology should be shut down for the Sabbath? I wish! <br /> <br />Other minor gripes: this book is short on physical description of any kind. Also, the two and a half romances which meander along through its pages proceed so strangely that you'll occasionally feel you MUST have skipped fifty pages in there somewhere. Most everything is left hideously (NOT tantilizingly) unresolved at the end. And the sad fact is that if you don't speak a fair to middling amount of basic Hebrew, you will miss some detail. Exasperating. <br /> <br />So do what I did. Check this book out from the library, but don't buy it. If you can ignore a little strangeness for a big payoff, read (or re-read) A Man Called Blessed, instead.	2004-09-10

Second, the bad guy is just too bad, being a demented, abusive murderer, while the good guys, frankly, are just not good enough. To me this story also seemed short on emotion between the leading couple. And the multiplicity of subplots leaves you feeling that nothing's ever been fully developed.

But does our heroine attempt to confront said snobbish relatives? No. Does she attempt to honestly clear the air with our hero? Not worth a hoot. It even takes a while before she seems to have strong feelings for her daughter. And our hero comes off as rather a judgmental jerk himself.

I'm lucky enough to know Peggy (Wallworth) Maddox, so OF COURSE I have to give her five stars! :) But there is one thing she's done here which seriously deserves special attention. She has, I think, managed to provide workable possible answers to some of the questions which may particularly trouble younger contemporary readers confronting the Biblical accounts of the rebellions of Korah and Dathan and Abiram. (For example, why were whole households killed when God punished evildoers?) While not simplying these questions, she hasn't ducked them either, and the result, besides being a good yarn, is an imaginative expansion of Biblical accounts that reconciles God's love with His justice. I may not agree with her interpretation at every point, but I can certainly applaud what she has accomplished.	2004-06-29

So I really enjoyed this book, which is basically what the title says it is, although the authors expand somewhat on each of the 76 ideas. The only drawback is that occasionally their tone becomes rather nagging or reprimanding--the assumption seems to be that you picked the book up not so much because you enjoy Christmas as because you are doing Christmas BADLY, and need the experts to get you out of the mess you've made.

This is a powerful fantasy with a lot to say about loyalty, love, purity, and integrity in everyday &quot;real life.&quot; One fascinating aspect of the book is Lawhead's ability to weave together stories that you might not have thought of together before--Atlantis, Taliesin, and Arthur all are eventually brought to life against the fading background glory of the Roman Empire. Miracles and magic mingle with nitty-gritty questions of survival, and moral dilemmas are neither ducked nor glossed over. This book is, and will stay, on my keeper shelf as a Christian response to those writers who seem to think fantasy must be tawdry and shocking to be any good.	2004-06-21

Somewhere I saw this book described as a sweet story of two wounded souls giving love a second chance. Unfortunately it just ain't so. Our hero is a reclusive pilot dealing with his tremendous guilt over the death of his young daughter, but he spends a surprising amount of his time being a jerk. Our heroine is the recently-divorced mother of a traumatized, withdrawn little girl. She is on the run from her ex-husband, who is trying to have the little girl institutionalized so that he can gain access to her trust fund. His hovering presence darkens much of the story. It never became clear to me whether the little girl was supposed to have a developmental disability or not, the two main characters spent way too much time at odds with each other, and the ending, which happened IMMEDIATELY after their discovery of their mutual love, was much too abrupt. <BR>All that said, some of the minor characters (the heroine's father and the hero's Inuit housekeeper, for instance) are intriguing. But the real hero of this book is the Malumute named Zeus. Really.	2004-06-21

Yes, this is a time-travel tale, but more than that, it is a story about the kinds of sacrifice love is willing to make. Nobody gets beat over the head with the lesson here, but it will stick with you. Heads up: parts of this will be pretty heavy going for younger/more sensitive juvenile readers as blood sacrifice is discussed pretty frankly (though not at all graphically) here.	2004-06-18

Ellen's tyrranical old-fashioned boss won't give her a promotion she deserves because she (Ellen) isn't married. So what's a girl to do? Borrow a picture of her ex-roommate's womanizing (but gorgeous) ex-boyfriend, who's conveniently away lawyering for the rich and famous in Europe, and tell everyone they're engaged, of course. Except that said ex-boyfriend (Josh) gets wind of the scheme, and basically being a good-hearted type in spite of himself, reappears and decides to help his ex-girlfriend's nice ex-roommate out. Well, you know how it goes from there. It's eerily similar to the plot of Day LeClaire's Accidental Wife (even down to the needy family members leaning heavily on the heroine), with the refreshing twist that Josh and Ellen, unlike Jonah and Nikki, actually LIKE each other from the word go. And with the exception of a few lurid fantasies Josh fleetingly entertains, things stay pretty clean. Both hero and heroine go heavily into self-sacrificing mode toward the end (I won't tell him/her I love him/her because s/he will be better off if I don't) but it's worth getting through. Even the description of Josh's troubled childhood is handled with remarkable tact and gentleness, and an impressive lack of cheesiness.	2004-06-18

She's really on to something, having figured out that kindness is just about the most attractive trait a hero can have. And this story's FUNNY, too--Toni's trek to the small-town grocery, her attempt at cookie-baking, and the adventures of the inimitable Madame Yeltsey (did I spell that right?) are priceless!	2004-06-17

Personally I've enjoyed Lawhead's ability to write from several points of view, though I guess that's basically a matter of taste. Also, he presents an Arthur we can both admire and empathize with. And it's easy to cherish this glimpse of a world where love and integrity are such active forces.	2004-06-16

Since this book was part of the Fabulous Fathers Series, I had high hopes for it. Somehow, though, the characters seemed underdeveloped, low on emotion, and rather unbelievable. The child at the center of the custody battle doesn't seem real til near the middle of the story; til then she's one of those &quot;placeholders&quot;--children the author puts in because the story requires a child. I actually found a minor character, lawyer Alec Barclay, much more intriguing than the hero. And that's a bad sign! And excuse me, but what judge on earth is really going to ask our heroine, in the middle of a hearing, &quot;Have you always loved this man?&quot; Really now. The obsessive grandmother's sudden emotional breakdown was a little hard to swallow too--she doesn't really come across as likely to crack under pressure. The tea-party business is cute, but . . .For a better take on the single-dad plot, try Cara Colter's &quot;Truly Daddy.&quot;	2004-06-16

And second, Tara is a product of the Marcus-Walcott clan, who have managed to redefine \\"dysfunctional\\" in various other Margot Early stories. And Tara's cause, which plays a big role here, is that midwives shouldn't have to be liscensed. The baby actually has a fairly minor role, and you get the feeling that Early would've done without her if she could've.<br />HOWEVER,the story is saved by our hero, Isaac McCrea, pragmatic doctor, terrible housekeeper, and rather lapsed Quaker, and father of three marvelous kids by his late Rwandan wife. Isaac's insights into what it means to be married are a major point in this book's favor.<br />One important note: a disturbing scene occurs when Tara, once again jailed for her stance on liscensing, is nearly sexually assaulted by another woman. This is not so much a spoiler as a heads-up: the passage will be extremely difficult for anyone who's done time, waited as a relative did time, or suffered such assault.	2004-06-14

David Blade is an unusually real hero dealing with the intense pain caused by the suicide of his troubled wife. Jean Young is dealing with shadows of failure from her own past. If you are like me, about three quarters of the way through this book you won't be able to stand the stress. You may just decide all the trauma is simply not worth it, and frankly, you may really dislike David ('s okay; he's imaginary!!!). But . . .this book has an incredible ending, more impressive than I would have said an author could pull off. Many stars to Early! (Those wanting a different perspective on the events leading up to this story should take a look at Early's Forever and a Baby.)	2004-05-06

Like Streiker's Bride and Streiker the Killdeer, it carries a powerful message about a Christian's relationship to God. I was dissatisfied with the extent to which the role of the church in a Christian's life is downplayed, but this book is still on my shelf to stay. A word about the ending--I found it amazing. It was the first book-ending in ages which had really surprised me, and that alone says something. What's more, it was beautiful. Kudos to Robin!	2004-04-30

This is a thorough-going vocabulary list and (morphological) analysis of Tolkien's LOTR languages. A fun resource for fans, but also rather fascinating for anybody into conlangs (constructed languages), and anybody researching LOTR purely as a pop culture phenomenon. I was a little disappointed in the presentation of the script (the page is a bit blurry), and would have loved a little more info on the process of creation. But still just a neat book!	2004-04-28

US	33666987	RCQSZE86QZJX9	0263128423	661874618	Ride a Storm	Books	1	0	0	N	N	...or maybe not	If you're in line at the DMV, and you realize you forgot to bring along your copy of \\"Higher Mathematics for Everybody,\\" and the only thing on the magazine rack is a two-month-old copy of Field and Stream, you might give this story a chance. But if you're easily irritated by spoiled, self-centered heroines with names like Cadence Copperthorne, skip it. (It gets worse--the hero's name is Dace. Dace and Cade--get it? Unfortunately they don't, for an unnaturally long time.) (...)The thing is, of course, that there's no such thing as \\"life in a wheelchair,\\"--only lives, individual people dealing with individual difficulties and triumphs. To sum up, readers who are tempted to check out \\"Ride\\" should resist the temptation--stick with the books Wilder has written under the pseudonym Cara Colter.	2004-03-23
