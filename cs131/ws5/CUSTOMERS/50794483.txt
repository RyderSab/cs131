So many other 'spy' books use the same old hackned plots:  'World domination,' 'I've got a nuclear bomb' 'Oh look, the ebola virus again.'  This one at least uses  what I feel is a more real world approach to hunting down terrorists.  I  came away feeling as though the CT team were the real thing rather than the  typical 'bang-bang, shoot 'em up, I'm one tough SOB' approach.	2000-01-19

Georg Andersen believes that many Christians are missing out on an  opportunity to impact others through the way they live, as much as what  they say. So he has opened his own home to show them how.        In  &quot;Silent Witness: The Language of Your Home&quot; the man whose firm  has helped style the White House and an international list of luxury homes,  exclusive hotels and elite restaurants, details how simple touches can  change the atmosphere and touch lives.        &quot;Our homes speak about  our beliefs, priorities and purpose in life. These are the words of silent  witness that influence others,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't mean putting  crosses and embroidered Bible verses all over the wall, although I have  nothing against that...but there are better ways than slapping someone in  the face.&quot;        &quot;Silent Witness&quot; explains how Andersen and  his wife turned a Connecticut farmhouse-style property in Arkansas into  their new home, after years of living in New York. The book takes readers  on a room-by-room guided tour, showing how layout and decoration can help  create the right mood, and provide conversation points of faith.         Even seemingly insignificant personal treasures can be used to make an  impact, he says--like the stone engraved with the word &quot;grace,&quot;  which sits on a table in what he calls &quot;the welcome room,&quot; rather  than the foyer. It was a gift from the family's pastor, shortly before  Andersen learned his young grandson was autistic.        &quot;God really  spoke to me [through it] inthose days, and showed me His grace in my  darkest hour,&quot; he recalls. &quot;On occasions when people come in they  will remark on the stone, and I will retell the story. I always fall apart  when I tell it, and someone else will say, 'We didn't know you had hurts.  We thought you had it all together. We have hurts; can we share them with  you?'&quot;        A frequent guest on television and radio, Andersen says  that many Christians fail to make the most of their homes either because  they feel guilty about what they do have, or they feel that they don't have  enough to be able to make anything of it.        &quot;Some feel that they  have to live in a clinical environment and are afraid to begin to fulfill  what God has put in them with regard to creativity,&quot; he says.  &quot;[But] the home is exalted throughout Scripture, and beauty is of God.  I'm not talking about gilded candles; whatever you perceive to be  beautiful, it comes from Him.        &quot;I have had people tell me they  couldn't entertain because their home was not up to snuff, and they wished  it was perfect. But perfect will never come...Doors will open when we  invite people in, not to take a tour but to share each others'  hearts.&quot;       Andersen's mission has been endorsed by Arkansas Gov.  Mike Huckabee, who credits the designer with helping &quot;make the mansion  a home,&quot; when he took office. &quot;He helped us make the family  quarters uniquely ours,&quot; he says.<br />Reproduced by permission of  Charisma News Service	2000-01-19

While cancer slowly destroys police lieutenant Dakota Blackwood's wife, a serial killer resurfaces after  a two-year silence.  Because he led the task force during the first  investigation, he feels compelled to make up for his past failure.  I  thought the fact that he is an Apache Indian only made the story more  enjoyable.  Having to face the very real prospect that he might have to  raise his two daughters without his wife, Dakota Blackwood, still feels a  responsibility to the people of Albuquerque, despite the fact of the  prejudicial undercurrents in the story. I loved the story's opening.  I'm  from Sacramento, CA where the original real life drama occurred that  appears in the opening chapter.   If you want to read something that  deviates from the standard serial killer slasher yarn, read this one.	2000-01-18

Sometimes we don't think before we act  or say things. In this book you will shutter at the mere fact of how we as  human beings treat each other and other forms of life on this planet. We  are allowing ourselves to live a lie and ignore what we have to offer.     I don't think I have ever met someone who has suffered more, and maintained  their dignity, pride, and intelligence as much as  k.t. Frankovich. If you  have had the pleasure to meet her, like I have, you would know the minute  you speak with her that she has experienced what would take many lifetimes  for any one of us to experience and witness. She is someone we all need to  stop, listen, and learn from. Mark my words.  They say that as we pass  through lives our soul advances to the next level in spirituality. In this  life k.t. has taken a leap forward that many of us can hopefully learn from  in her book and leap forward right behind her. This book makes me want to  give her a great big hug!	2000-01-16

Among those featuring Italian dishes, Floria Parmiani's Vegitalian is especially appealing for it can be read on two integrated levels. The  author takes the narrow intersection of Italian cuisine and vegetarian  cooking and places that interplay within the general context of Italian  society. The result is a rich resource of la cucina italiana and a showcase  for la cultura italiana.  The art, history, and landmarks of many of  Italy's twenty regions are discussed along with each region's particular  culinary specialties. Reading that Sicily leads Europe in the production of  citrus fruits, olives, grapes, and wines gave me much satisfaction. Both  the accompanying photos of cities, art and architectures, and the cultural  context serve to elevate the book above the usual mere listing of recipes.  The introduction, as one example, has a poetic tone that paints colorful  images in the reader's mind. The book's overall simplistic style emphasizes  variety and wholesomeness.  There are more than 200 recipes using  commonly available ingredients. The recipes are grouped into large  categories, such as vegetable creams, soups, sauces, antipastos, pasta and  sauces, and salads and desserts. Most can be prepared quickly by the busy  homemaker. Also included are helpful cooking hints, and lists of wines,  cheeses, herbs, and spices.  Floria Parmiani, a native of Florence,  Italy, and currently a San Francisco resident, where she teaches and  writes, has produced a masterpiece that is refreshingly free of  mystical-sounding ingredients and complicated directions. However, I must  append a gentle caveat to this review. Several times while perusing the  delicious vegetarian dishes, I was interrupted by severe pangs of hunger.	2000-01-15

So begins this bizarre trip into the supernatural.  It turns out Jenny has survived a terrible crash but can't remember the  accident or the weeks leading up to the accident.  Enter a police detective  who at first makes Jenny think shes done something terrible to cause her  accident. The twist is: someone wanted Jenny dead and the detective is  trying to figure out who and why. You are exquisitely teased with the  notion that either the ghost of Jenny is trying to kill her or someone  human is trying to kill her. While the detective is trying to unravel the  mystery behind Jenny's attempted murder, Jenny is trying to find a way to  escape the ghost's torment.<br />Dark Side definitely keeps you turning pages  as you seek to figure out not only who the would-be killer is, but also how  Jenny can escape the Doppelganger. Because it seems the ghost is  spiritually connected to her, she can't just flee the house as is so often  the case in your typical ghost story.<br />The story plays out at a rapid pace  and Barlog keeps dangling suspense in front of you to keep you reading.

Besides being impressed with her book in general, its the best self-help book I have ever come across. I'm not sure how to  convey how very relevant the book was to me, but I will try.   One of the  things she advises is not to stay with a therapist that presses you to  remain in therapy with them despite your wishes to the contrary. After  nearly two years of therapy mine tried to persuade me to remain in therapy  with her instead of leaving for graduate school in another state.  Fortunately, I was confident and strong enough to go ahead with graduate  school. I've always wanted and needed to take more control of my life and  your book will definitely help with that.<br />Your scenerios also helped me  locate specific events in my life and choices that I have made that I now  can see as results of not having good self-esteem. My lack of self-esteem  has caused me so much grief, anxiety, and general damage. I am much more  aware now of how my thoughts influence and determine circumstances at  times. Most of all, without a better way to express it, I have been able to  recently put in writing how I feel about the adults who played a part in  the formation of my self-esteem when I was a child. Should I seek further  therapy, I now have specific scenerios and an understanding of my issues to  take with me to the therapists office. Thank You!	2000-01-02

Let me first say I have read over 2 dozen Y2K books. Most of them are either end of civilization books, pushing a specific philosophy, or are ponderous reference guides on how to build your own solar house out of mud  and make gourmet dinners out of moss while generating nuclear energy from  old milk jugs. This book falls into none of the above catagories.  After a  brief introduction, this book goes over possible scenarios and gives you  the facts so you can draw some of your own conclusions. They then offer  several recommendations for addressing each scenario.   One of the things I  really liked was that you were given hot tips on how to easily cope with  many problems, and as questions were raised they were answered. You do not  have to go out and buy another book to tell you what to do after you read  this book!   This book is written in an easy to understand non-technical  manner, but it is not short on technical advice, it just does not bludgeon  you over the head with it.  One of the most useful parts is a Y2K resource  guide on where to find whatever you're looking for that is Y2K related, as  well as additional information on that particular topic.  The best  testimony I can give is that my wife, who at first thought I was a little  off base, read this book and hasn't given it back since. She has been  explaining Y2K to all friends, and they now think she's some sort of an  expert on it. I may have to get another copy!   The bottom line is that  this book is user friendly and packed with the kind of information you  need, for Y2K or any other natural or man made disaster. Most other Y2K  books don't even devote a chapter to any really practical advice, this is a  whole book of it!  Complaint, the book is organized well, but I wish it had  an index, it has so much information, that would really enhance it. Also, I  wish I had bought this book first, It would have saved me alot of time and  money. It didn't come out till the second half of this year, but maybe  that's why it's so up-to-date.	1999-12-28

To the person who stated that pamphlet would be a better term, according to the Library of Congress a one page printed item is techincally a BOOK.<br />There are NO lay books other than this one available to the public  and any MEDICAL treatments written on Bells Palsy would giberish to a non  medical person.<br />A pamphlet is generally only a couple of printed very  small pages such as a religious tract.<br />This book waS WRITTEN BY ONE OF MY  BEST FRIENDS WHO SPENT a lot of blood sweat and many tears doing all the  research both on the net(which he is an expert on, and was a technical  advisor on for 2 years) and at librarys, and through writing many people  and calling many people for their experiences with this dibilitating,  embarrassing, and psycologically damaging disorder.<br />Basicly, in the  medical community there is only speculation on the causes and possible  effects of Bells Palsy.Some Doctors say herpes is involved yet many  patients test negative on any known form of herpes.<br />So this book is the  best and ONLY one available that is written at this time.<br />For those who  want bulk weight for their money from Amazon I would reccomend War and  Peace by Tolstoy or possibly The Rise and Fall Of the Third Reich.<br />For  general and helpful reassurance on Bells Palsy ,it is this book or no book.  If you can write a better one I am sure that Jack Dambach, the author and  two time sufferer of Bells Palsy, as well as myself and many others would  buy a copy.<br />Those who can do,while those who can't criticize.	1999-12-22

Books	5	9	10	N	N	Easy to Use, Thought-Provoking, Very Enjoyable	I saw myself in How to Create Your Own Super Second Life so clearly. I am in the Second Tier: 55+, and I am dealing with many of the issues you discuss. I enjoyed the quotes scattered throughout the book and your  irreverent sense of humor in describing some of the facts and fiction about  aging.<br />I found the exercises very useful. The super second life dream  list was particularly poignant for me as I realized how long I have let my  dreams stay inside without being realized. I am just now, at 57, starting  to let go of the &quot;shoulds&quot; and am looking at the  &quot;wants&quot; that I have put on the shelf for another time.<br />I also  found the Money Worksheet very helpful in focusing in on how much I have  and what I need to retire. I realized I had more than I thought, and that  the things I would like to do in retirement do not cost that much. <br />Too  sum it up, I found the book thought-provoking, easy-to-read, and a very  good primer in giving myself permission to have a super second life, with  the tools to make that happen. The personal, conversational tone of the  book made it very enjoyable to read.	1999-12-22

I begin reading books of this nature because an author named Canyon Adams, who wrote 666 The Beast Revealed, first turned me on to how Christianity is the woman who rides the beast. After that book, I bought a couple dozen  more, including this one. This author is very close, except for the fact  that he points out how Catholicism only is the woman.  Catholicism is PART  of that woman, but Christianity, as other authors have pointed out, is the  WHOLE woman.  Good job, though.  Thoughtful.  Somewhat decently written.  A  bit weak in areas.  But closer to the truth than some others I've read.	1999-12-21

The action is quick-paced and just scary enough to spice the reading with pleasant shivers.  Ms. Getzinger has created some of the most original creatures this side of Oz.   I particularly like the Brownies of the Hills of Hanukkah and the  Tricksters of Halloween Forest.  No one can argue with (the story's)  message: Christmas is too special to throw away on December 26th.  Unlike  most Christmas stories, Saving Christmas Spirit takes place the week after  Christmas.  Written for children 8-12 years old, it is the perfect way for  kids to fill the empty afternoons between Christmas and New Years.  I  highly recommend it.	1999-12-14

It is a gripping  story of the struggles they endured and obstacles they overcame in order to  pursue their love for music and survive as a family in the process.

Then she would know that men will never admit there  is something that they cannot fix. If they can't fix it they will hide it  somehow.<br />Although John and I have a lot of dfferences, there are many  things about us that are similar. I suppose, related to being a man. <br />To  be fair, I could poke some fun at women. I always wondered why God made  women the worse drivers in the world. And my wife checks everything twice  or three times before leaving the house, including water faucets, ashtrays,  etc, which takes her a half hour. Then, she goes back to recheck sometimes.  Is there any hope for men? <br />My wife snores, I snore, the dog snores. On  occason, the dog will leave for the quiet of the living room to sleep when  it all gets too noisy in the bedroom. <br />The book has influenced me to find  humor in my life. It's also a great gift idea.	1999-12-12

Marine Captain and pilot B.W. Peterson was actively involved in the war with Korea  and his memoirs are a most worthy source of valid personal history in his  book,&quot;Short Straw.&quot; The book is Peterson's sequel to his first  book, &quot;Briny to the Blue, Memoirs of WW2 by a Sailor/Marine Fighter  Pilot.&quot; His qualifications include 27 service awards, with the Silver  Star, three Distinguished Flying Crosses, nine Air Medals, the Bronze Star  with Combat V, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V and the Purple  Heart.<br />The author reminds us that the U.S. and the United Nations were in  Korea in order to save the newly established Republic of Korea (ROK) from  the invading Communist hordes, first the North Koreans and then the  Chinese. Following WW2, as has been our history after a war, the U.S. again  greatly reduced its military forces and was ill-prepared for another  war.<br />Although Peterson had more than volunteered his patriotic desire  during WW2, yet seeing his country poorly prepared to fight, it made him  see the need to volunteer again for the Marine Corps. It was a difficult  decision, leaving a loving family, comfortable home and fine job. However,  he willingly tackled re-training as a Marine fighter pilot and an  assignment in Korea to a Fighter Squadron (VMF-212), flying F4U  Corsairs.<br />Much of this exciting book contains letters by Peterson written  to his wife and family. In his letters, the Marine pilot portrayed his  day-to-day thoughts and &quot;gut-wrenching reality of the conflict as it  unfolded from an eye-witness standpoint.&quot; The book also describes  Captain Peterson's tour and experiences as a Forward Air Controller with  the 1st Marine Division.<br />Flying the WW2 prop-driven Corsair, Peterson  tells about his first in-flight encounter with the Russian made jet MIG-15  in Korea:&quot;Suddenly, right off my cockpit and right wingtip,  basketball-sized fireballs with six foot tails shot by. Then, like a shot,  a Communist MIG, with that familiar swept-wing and tail, blue nose, and red  star on the fuselage, went streaking by and I knew it had come from his 37  mm cannon fire. Here I am in the Jet Age, in another war, still flying a  Corsair, but with my role now switched from a fighter to bomber, and being  dependent on our jet fighters for our support. Nothing stays the same for  long.&quot;<br />Peterson selected the title of his book, &quot;Short  Straw,&quot; from the situation where Forward Air Controllers were needed  and his name was drawn, as in drawing straws. For a pilot who loved to fly,  the ground assignment had to be a blow, but he accepted it in stride.  Unfortunately, much of the responsibility of the Forward Air Controller was  in the front line of the ground war, where he received a minor  wound.<br />This is a heart warming book about a true patriot, love of family,  and war. It has my enthusiastic endorsement.	1999-12-11

They say you should never judge a book by its cover, but since I had never heard of Karen Quiones-Miller before I admit it was the cover that made me pick this book up. I'm glad I did. It was great! The heroine in  Satin Doll is tuff! Girlfriend knows her stuff, and doesn't take any stuff  off anyone else. I loved reading about a woman who once was down and out  and made it to the top on her own. And being from Harlem myself I could  really relate to some of the things she's been through.<br />Regina has a  serious attitude. I loved her and her girlfriends. They actually remind me  of friends of mine, and I bet every black woman who reads this book will  say the same thing.  I was rolling with laughter at some of the tricks  Regina used to get back at people -- especially men -- who's done her  wrong. I only wish I had thought of some of them when I was in similar  situations. The only bad thing about the book was that it had some  typographical errors, but nothing major. I really recommend this book to  everyone.	1999-12-09

Books	5	14	15	N	N	A key to the witches' ointment	Any book, which starts by dissuading you from killing yourself can't be all bad. Alexander Kuklin cautions his readers, frequently, against messing around with witches' herbs. The results of consuming aconite, belladonna, thornapple and water hemlock are spelt out in grisly detail. It certainly puts you off. Anyone familiar with the happy-go-lucky style of medieval cookbooks will doubt whether peasant women thought in terms of exact doses and measures, even if death was the penalty for miscalculation.  Nevertheless, there are first-hand reports, by Laguna and Gassendi, of ointments, which did produce delirium and dreams of flight. Kuklin suggests in his closing chapter that the secret lay in balancing herbal sources of aconitine and atropine, which tend to cancel each other out. An American magical group is testing the recipe, in a hush-hush sort of way. The results may appear in a peer-reviewed journal. But in the evidence so far, they are equally likely to end up in the morgue.	1999-12-08

A book starring butterfly-winged foxes sounds like it would be too, too cute, but the Kashra are very dramatic characters.  Kidd has created a detailed and wholly original culture for them, partly based  on Aboriginal tribalism but also imaginatively using fantasy such as the  strength of the characters' &quot;ka&quot; (psychic force) affecting their  flying ability more than the muscles of their wings.  When a famine strikes  an ancient and culturally stagnant society, changes must be made to avoid  starvation.  Two sisters follow two roads to change; Shadarii preaches  love, while Zhukora champions violent revolution.  It is easy to side with  Shadarii, but Kidd keeps the reader guessing whether her way is effective  enough to save the Kashra before starvation overwhelms everyone.  A  gripping page-turner!	1999-12-08

What a fantastic, little story about a young skunk who is sad because he can't get his tail sprayer to spray.  The great thing about this book is its ability to reach several age groups through its simplicity.  There are  only a few sentences on each page, so the very young child can view a  moving picture of a skunk in all its most playful positions.  Three- and  four-year-olds can read, laugh at, and talk about a black and white skunk  named PeeWee Pipes who has a tail sprayer that is malfunctioning, and the  older child (five- or six-year-old) can turn to the last page and learn  some important facts about actual skunk behavior and eating habits.

It is failure's peculiar fate that its reputation is routinely reinforced  by negative perceptions.<br />Gary Ryan Blair explained to me that failure  does have an ulterior motive... not to get you to quit, but to stop you long  enough so that you may learn something, re-strategize, and re-launch again  more prepared for success.<br />This single insight was one of the most  important thoughts I'd come across in years.

When I'm in the diner, I am able to look at my own life and see how  God is working.<br />I know first hand how much work it is to first of all  write a book, but secondly to keep the book lively and fun from the first  page to the last. Chris and Kim have succeeded. <br />Get out that credit card  now and buy Conversations at the Girlville Diner. You will be so glad you  did.	1999-12-04

There is something in the book, which is new and interesting.  There are hints that the ointment idea has been around for a while.  It is, that aconite and belladona work in combination with each other to produce the  flying ointment. The idea is that aconite in itself is deadly poisonous -  in fact it's considered the most poisonous plant in Europe - hemlock being  the most poisonous plant in the U.S.  Now, how can notorious poisons be  part of a flying ointment?  According to the author, atropine (belladona)  is an antidote for aconite poisoning.  Aconite apparently kills by slowing  the heart, while belladona increases the heart rate (producing, in fact, a  good, strong heart beat).  So, of course, you combine belladonna and  aconite in your flying ointment, and there you go.	1999-12-03

The author claims,  with much scientific support and measurement that on the first date a woman  knows to withhold sex until the male has proved himself a worthy, long term  lover, but in time, assuming a marriage or long term relationship, she  comes to believe that sex is a free marital good which the male  successfully demands and receives too much for his own good. Rather than  being on his best and most affectionate &quot;first date&quot; behavior he  is like a child served his favorite meal to often to the point where his  appreciation of the thing he is programmed to value most is lost. Then,  both  feel unloved and eventually a divorce is the result. The author's  statistical claim is that a female's sexual communication skill is best and  most purposive on the first date, due to fundamental evolutionary forces,  and fades thereafter as she slowly comes to believe, or is persuade by her  mate, that her obligation is to provide sex on demand rather than in return  for &quot;first date&quot; affectionate and loving behavior. An ingenious  and actionable theory, based on much fact and observations of the sex life  of many couples on route to divorce, to hopefully stem the 50% divorce  rate. Who knows of a better theory,especially a better theory that can be  remembered and acted on?	1999-12-01

I belive that an author can realate the depth of love between two people without going to such lengths. ..And If you  want to  read another book that  goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by  Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is  a beautiful story of unrequited love. .  .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a  quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the  book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the  heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing  love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death,  makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of  humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit  when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of  being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers  that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had  an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen  Moments  is written  with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is  a spellbinder.  What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!    This book  was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest  information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started  college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any  illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A  gift to be  cherished  forever.	1999-12-01

This is a great book for building discussions about such stories as: Creation, Noah, Moses,Jonah,The 23rd  Psalm,Ecclesiastes,Daniel and the lions den, Annunciation of Mary, Loaves  and Fishes,Crucifixion,Easter and the Pentecost. The front cover looks like  a stained-glass mural but melts into a 3-D Crucifixion scene (once you  figure out how to see in 3-D! Instructions are included).  Probably the  best image is the Annunciation of Mary.  You can see the faces of Gabriel  and Mary!  I also liked the way  Moses &quot;parts&quot; the Red Sea in  3-D. Very effective.

The quality of writing is excellent; the  mixture of personal and more broadly social history is a fine choice for  such a study. This is a very finely etched story, and one that I really  enjoyed reading. It moves easily. Her tour (of the Philippines) is vivid,  and since the area itself is so distant and foreign to many of her readers,  the fascination increases. She is clearly not a local, yet clearly this is  her family landscape. She seems comfortable and familiar with things, yet  she find herself making discoveries after hearing about these things for so  long.&quot; &quot;P. Skenazy, U.C. Santa Cruz	1999-12-01

James R. Fisher, Jr. follows similar  approaches, but does so, to this reviewer's opinion, with great insight,  philosophical depth and uncanny predictive truth.<br />This book provides  readers with an accurate development of organizations in the USA over the  past century, and those crucial factors that must be taken into  consideration if organizations are to survive.  Fisher's vibrant prose  explores the dominant cultures in the marketplace, the need for a new set  of organizational paradigms, incipient catastrophe, the six silent killers,  the cutlures of comfort, complacency, and contribution.<br />The author opens  his heavily documented and self-experienced work with the dilemma that has  spawned the &quot;Six Silent Killers,&quot; and discusses why this  phenomenon is the latest and greatest challenge to management.  He observes  that &quot;professionals have the mind of an artist, rather than that of an  analyst, more the heart of the creator than the discoverer, more the soul  of the rebel than the patriot.&quot;<br />The book examines those areas that  have created what Fisher calls &quot;the new workforce that the  post-industrial society has created.&quot;  He cites the six silent  killers, which have evolved in organizations as &quot;a reaction to the  frustration with the growing breach between the role demands of modern  workers and the self-demands of those in charge.&quot;<br />Fisher's six  silent killers, &quot;the manic monarchs of the merry madhouse,&quot; are  passive aggression, passive responsive, passive defensive, malicious  obedience, approach avoidance, and obsessive compulsive behaviors.<br />His  poetic description indicates that these silent killers &quot;eat at the  sinews of organizations, and workers who display them have an amazing  ability to appear as performers when they clearly are not.  They are caught  in the crunch between hypocrisy and hype, turning their frustrations into  deceptive devices.  They are looking for leadership in a leaderless  society.  They are looking for direction when nobody admits to being off  course.  They are looking for real work in the chaos of activities.   Wherever they look, they find confusion.  Nobody knows who is in control or  who has the power.  Managers and workers alike, equally frustrated, spread  these silent killers.  Nobody is in charge.  Management plays the role but  has little control.  Workers are reluctant to step up to the challenge of  taking control because they don't want the responsibility.  So control and  productive effort slip silently between them, covered by the smoke and  mirrors of frenzied activity.&quot;(pp. 87, 88)<br />After a substantive  analysis of organizations and managers and workers, which represents the  residue of an obsolete culture, Fisher explores the cultures of comfort,  complacency and contribution.  He suggest that modern organizations should  develop the culture of contribution, which represents &quot;an entirely new  landscape for doing business, a new visage and frame of reference.  It is  the land of growth and contribution.&quot;<br />This book is written with  sincerity and passion, evoking incredible syntactic imagery and stimulating  thought.  However, it is more an analytical approach in understanding cause  and effect of American Society and its organizations rather than the  process of solutions.  It is optimistic, perhaps simplistic in the  actualization of coping behaviors for survival, but it is very deep in  ferreting out those hidden factors (subconscious) that impact behavior  without an explanation as to why this kind of behavior occurs.<br />James R.  Fisher, Jr. has succeeded in writing a book which is a valuable  contribution to the fields of psychology, philosophy and business.  He  provides insight and importantissues in contemporty society that allows  readers and organizations to understand, prepare for, and survive the new  millennium.	1999-11-30

After submitting  to psychiatric treatment and dutifully taking various antidepressant and  antiaxiety medications, she followed the advise of her physician and  submitted to controversial Botox injections, permitting her doctor to  inject her vocal folds with the deadly bacterial agent, botulinum toxin.  <br />  While the treatment ostensibly worked for Ms. Rehm, namely, she  'recovered' her voice, it fails to yield consistent results with many  patients diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia--or strangled voice.  Now a  leading spokesperson for the Spasmodic Dysphonia Association, Ms. Rehm  regrettably ignores a balanced discussion about other effective treatments,  including, the non-toxic, non-invasive process of direct voice  rehabilitation. <br />  While it's exemplary that Ms. Rehm adopted the cause  of spasmodic dysphonia, readers deserve a more even-handed discussion of  other available treatments.  Blessed with good fortune, readers shouldn't  generalize too far beyond Ms. Rehm's own happy ending.	1999-11-30

(At the drop  of a hat, they'll see &quot;hidden agendas&quot; everywhere among their  opponents, but it's interesting that these carefully-concealed  &quot;agendas&quot; are never well-hidden enough to be found and  &quot;exposed&quot;!)<br />The only missing element I'd like to have seen in  this book is an analysis of WHY the left continues to be confined mainly to  academia and the literary community--and conspicuously absent among  working-class people, except for impressionable, upscale college-age people  whose worldviews have been shaped almost entirely by the media. For  example, we're constantly told that violent movies and cartoons entice  children to violence. But we're NEVER told that media rants about the  disparity of income, and how the rich get richer while the poor get poorer,  entice anyone towards robbery or burglary!<br />The implication here, of  course, is that the further one is from the workaday world, the more  personally responsible one feels for social problems. (In plain English,  self-blame for things that they had nothing to do with.) This is the key  fact about the left that explains its worldview.<br />Most of the people who  swallow the pie-in-the-sky guff of the left would be shaken to their core  if they could read this book and see how the political realm really works.	1999-11-30

Feels good when high tech and millennium headlines furrow the brow. Shappee, born in 1939, soaked up character, backbone and  indelible memories in Warrenton, Oregon and other towns along the magic  coastline. In this memoir, Shappee shares personal memories of his family,  of early homes and chums.  His dad was a fisherman, gone for long periods,  so mom did the raising.  In his teens, Shappee got to help his dad prepare  the boat for long runs to the Columbia River and the Pacific.  One home sat  across from the general store and gas station at Newton's Corners, a pefect  spot for curious, young eyes and ears.  The author shows what really  brought indoor plumbing home.  &quot;The biggest bear I had ever  seen,&quot; had trapped his mother in the outhouse.  A flashlight and  screwdriver helped young Shappee discover a forgotten, boarded-up library  in one house; including books with pictures of body parts! We ride along as  the boy gains his sea legs aboard his father's boat in heavy seas, and  smell the printer's ink during his first newspaper days on the hometown  Columbia Beacon.  All	1999-11-29

The subheadings, lively anecdotal style, index are all helpful for browsing. Since I started to learn chess only a  few months ago (at age 69), I assumed I would be able to make no sense at  all of the various chess games, but GM Schwartzman's chatty analyses and  inclusion of the notation letters/numbers along the edges of the diagrams  mean that I cannot only enjoy the chat and but see that with a little  effort I'll be able to get beyond it into the details of the games (a  little, anyway). I liked reading the accounts of people such as Bobby  Fischer, Garry Kasparov, Carol Jarecki, Florencio Camponmanes, Frank  Camaratta, etc., whose names are familiar to me from internet browsing  and/or chess fame.

In the end of 1993 someone told me to read this book.  She felt a connection to me with CP.  Because of her being a total stranger and how she  approached me with this book, I thought she was weird. I knew someone who  had this book and I borrowed it.  It caught my interest and I bought one of  my own, which I read twice.  The energy is what caught my attention in this  book.  In time I began to practise the energy seen in plants and trees.  I  caught myself more involved in information about Aura's.  At that time this  book also lead me toward meditation.  Eventually I found myself destine to  seek deeper. I held a pen in my hand and asked what my destiny was?  Why do  these things happen and who is behind all this?  Though this method did  reveal answers, I thought Satan was behind it.  Little do we know about the  unknown...until we understand the love and understanding of our creator.   God's techniques work mysterious in way's that are not commonly understood.   Therefore, you need to understand the barricade that separates you from  many hidden truths which is available for you to direct your destiny.  If  you are not rooted in what you believe to be true, critics can turn you  toward doubt and fear.  God is no fear nor is he punishing.  The physical  being connected to the external world, live's and applies the rules and  theories, which deal with fear beyond the means of God.  The soul is  connected to the internal world where it knows peace and wisdom with God.   The true characteristics of humankind develop these truths from within this  realm.  It is only known to that individual in spirit with spirit, whereas,  beyond the means of God is Ego against spirit.  Celestine Prophecy is a  book that enhanced my hidden abilities to get me where I am today.  I am  the Author of &quot;The Third Time Is Now&quot; and neither does my book  meet the writing Technques of today.  Nevertheless, the importance lie in  God's technique.  This is something you will better understand on your  spiritual journey. Book's such as Celestine Prophecy provokes the awakening  within to begin the search in means of the soul.  I hope you find my  experience with Celestine Prophecy enlightening toward your own spiritual  needs.	1999-11-29

As soon as I saw Harold Holzer on bookTV I immediately went out and bought this book. It is such a joy! I feel closer to Lincoln and feel I can summon him up more fully in my mind. The observations of those who knew him,  especially before his assassination and deification are so telling, about  the observer as much as the observed. It is clear that many focused on all  that was unimportant about a person -  physical appearance, clothing,  sophistication and the like. In these categories Lincoln was clearly  deficient.  However, most saw through that and were touched by the power of  this incredible man. Thank you, Harold, for this delicious book.	1999-11-29

His family lived in 19th-century fashion not from choice but because of poverty; they were poorer than the  Waltons but just as happy.  Shappee, a retired Navy Chief Warrant Officer  who served in Vietnam, wrote this memoir to show a consumer-oriented modern  society that family harmony can exist under dire circumstances.  His family  worked in the fisheries while living at Newton's Corners.  The neighbors  helped each other, particularly a young couple who were seperated by the  war when he was called to service.  During the 1950s, the Shappees moved to  Warrenton, where Rudolph spent the majority of his childhood.  Both of his  parents decided that a better life existed for them if they left the  fisheries and canneries and worked for the Singer Sewing Machine Company in  Tillamook, Oregon. &quot;Making My Way&quot; resembles many of those  nostalgic memoirs of family life, a la &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen,&quot;  &quot;Chicken Every Sunday,&quot; and &quot;The Egg and I&quot; which were  a staple of publishing in the post-World War II decade.  The charm of this  book is that it reminds a present generation that it wasn't so long ago  that America was not so prosperous, that most people accomplished things  without electronic tools, and that social organization was prized as a  necessity and not a sentimental idea.	1999-11-29
