Can't be any plainer.<br /><br />On surface, all starts well, and maybe we are supposed to draw some alliterative ideas that one should look below surface? as characters who seemed creepy have nice habits at the end, and the ones who aren't are MUCH slimier..<br /><br />Lynsey works for CMG a big showbiz agent agency... transferred to the Hollywood branch she finds her career dependent on that of one of her clients, Melanie.<br /><br />Melanie becomes increasingly neurotic when transplanted from her hometown & is challenged with a new starlet on the scene, Serena.<br /><br />Found it very strange that to justify Serena's breaking into the acting scene at the end of the novel the author uses some plot devices to \\"bring her low\\" whilst Melanie who also suffers a crippling blow to her pride then rises above it on strength of her own talent. Even Lynsey experiences difficulties of the sort which force her on.<br /><br />What is the moral? Don't go to Hollywood if you want to maintain any morales?<br /><br />In particular I found one scene made it's way into my nightmares - a debauch on the scale of the Marquess de Sade!

Taming of the Shrew?<br /><br />Not quite, but close enough.<br /><br />Damaris, (lovely name) last seen shrieking & threating in the original book has a wonderful background to unveil as a plausible explanation for her grasping behaviour.<br /><br />Her father was a merchant and varment of the high seas, and Damaris unabashedly shares his piratical tendencies. A girl after my own heart - in fact, just as ungracious at accepting a compliment. Applauded on her name, Damaris states baldly, \\"it means heifer in Greek\\". ..<br /><br />So, likeable although occasionally dense heroine, handsome and clever hero - oh yes, a little about him. Fitzroger is a bit of a henchman for the redoubtable Malloren Duke, as well as being the good friend and sometime hanger-on for the man Damaris had planned to marry, Ashart.<br /><br />Terribly honorable, not a bit servile and a wonder with the rapier!<br /><br />And the plot, the plot the plot.  Well... Damaris has been a bit of a vixen in the previous book and now must overcome her somewhat nasty reputation to make a suitable match. Being the girl she is, she determines to make the best match she can ie, the highest title she can purchase and has the notion to buy a Duke.<br /><br />Reality steps in the way a little when she must realise that she doesn't in fact want a Duke, and there are plenty of obstacles to be overcome, such as a lurking menace which Fitzroger is meant to guard against.<br /><br />And we all know how the heroine must fall in love with her guard!<br /><br />kotori 2005	2005-07-01

Stepping politely over the failures which some Regencies set purely in London court, Connie Brockway charms entirely within the confines of a little traveled village & and it's occupants.<br /><br />Being only my second novel from this author, I didn't know to look forwards to a plot with a `confidence trickster' masquerading as a Duke's daughter - instead I dreaded it. Until about 10 pages in when I realized it was absolutely perfect!<br /><br />The brash Letty impersonates Lady Agatha White & fills her shoes in arranging a wedding for a country miss.  She becomes involved unwillingly drawn into the lives and mini melodramas of the people around her, and falls hard for the local magistrate - Elliot. And that is enough of a plot synopsis for you lot! (greedy eyes)<br /><br />Charming where it could have been ridiculous, bold when it could have been trite, the simple ease and humor with which the author delights and entertains the reader is impossible to describe.<br /><br />In the unlikely Letty, we find no shrinking heroine, but a `woman of the world' who is quite aware of her own appeal and not a bit above using it.  Every chapter begins with a maxim, and I came to thoroughly enjoy them - take for example, `The villain gets to cheat, lie, steal, and kick the dog, because in the end you shoot him'.  All slightly stage centered advice passed on from her mother and the applicable line before each short chapter.<br /><br />Even the hero is thoroughly believable and wonderfully suave.<br /><br />Setting the time frame a little later than Regency England, into the last decade of Queen Victoria's reign, the dress provides a refreshing change from all that dampened muslin and so on!  Sweeping hats are delightfully apparent, and our heroine sashays well..<br /><br />A wonderful companion novel to Bridal Favours by Connie Brockway<br />(...)	2005-06-05

Enterprising lass that she is, upon bumping into him emerging from an older (married) ladies room she strikes a deal of silence which will leave him in her debt.<br /><br />She makes other unfortunate entrances also at this houseparty, and overhears some unkind ladies disparging her looks to the extent that she feels she must be terribly ugly - golem like in fact. This instance shapes her to the point that when she seeks out Justin 10 years later, Evie has entirely lost interest in her appearance and dresses in most a most utilitarian style.<br /><br />Calling upon the old IOU, Evie requests usage of Justins ancestral home, in order to host a wedding for a client. (Various strategems are imployed here, to make this necessary - Evie has taken on the family business which pads their modest income).<br /><br />In a well employed change from the much travelled theme of Regency England, the story is set in late Victorian times, where the glory of nobility has tarnished somewhat and the chaperonage is not quite as strict.<br /><br />Justin is soon revealed as a secret agent, and there are all sorts of comings and goings in the night which add to the atmosphere and create many an interesting byline.<br /><br />The delightfully entertaining exchanges between our leads make for delicious banter, whilst the tender love making scenes ought to be an inspiration to all writers.

Because in fact she showed none, and all the talk about it was just talk, and as such, not impressive but rather dull.<br /><br />Probably the least inspiring of the Bedwyn family saga's, at least until the last half of the book when the pace picks up and becomes more engrossing.<br /><br />kotori ojadis@yahoo.com	2005-05-03

Mr Darcy & Elizabeth (Bennet) have travelled overseas on a diplomatic mission and the 5 (!) daughters are launched upon the ton by their cousin Mr Fitzwilliam & his wife Fanny.<br /><br />The duckling line of girls begins with Letitia (full of sensibility), through Camilla (sense)and past twins Georgina & Belle (reincarnated Lydia's, apparently) and twinkles past Althea, the youngest daughter and a great music lover.<br /><br />Unfortunately Fanny is not the best ward for headstrong girls, and all sorts of trouble descend on the Darcy daughters, not the least of which is their aunt, Lydia. She has remarried another wastrel although this one hasn't the charm of Wickham.<br /><br />Lydia seems bent on inducing all sorts of fast behaviour in the girls, for reasons of her own.  She becomes more wicked than silly & figures large in their downfall.<br /><br />Darcy's lead as hero in Pride & Prejudice is replaced in this novel by the fiancee of Sophie, the daughter of the Gardners. He gradually becomes enchanted with Camilla, and it's all terribly predictable.<br /><br />Oh the pain of the writers who try and pick up where Jane Austen left off!<br /><br />Having endured a number of Emma Tennant's efforts however, this book is much more readable, even though it doesn't achieve the humor or gentle warmth which Jane Austen's books always glowed.<br /><br />Apart from all the confusion of trying to think who must have been whom in the original book, the plot is contrived & predictable, often falling into ludicrous behavior.<br /><br />A note to pause and say - good grief! As if a debut could ever be so mismanaged! And poor old Georgina Darcy was killed off before the beginning of the book, whilst Jane & her husband never get a look in, apart from two paragraphs referring to them.<br /><br />Now why the author felt the need to endow Mr & Mrs Darcy with 4 hellion daughters! They all follow the path Lydia beat earlier.<br /><br />It is terribly contrived & I cannot imagine that two loving & sensible parents like the original characters of Pride & Prejudice could raise such dreadful children.<br /><br />The reason the younger Bennet girls were so ramshackle is that they were encouraged in folly by Mrs Bennet. Without such a mother, it is most unlikely that the characters would form as imagined by Elizabeth Aston.<br /><br />The eldest girl Letitia is obviously a remake of Mary, and Camilla is just a rewritten Emma.<br /><br />Not only all this, but if the characters of the girls were so unreliable, there is no way in which their parents would have abandoned the girls at their presentation.<br /><br />So, it was interesting enough, but greatly frustrating when compared to the books of Austen.<br /><br />Rewriting an Austen will always bring a little extra publicity, and one must suppose this plays some part in the efforts of the writers. The discerning reader ought definately judge for herself the merits of such a borrowing of fame - in this case it could not be on the grounds of writers merit. Without the name of Darcy, this book would join the ranks of mediocre regency romances - like the lurid Stephanie Laurens, Mary Balogh, or a myriad other writers.<br /><br />Enjoyable enough, but the frustrations of seeing Darcy's children so misrepresented!!<br /><br />kotori ojadis@yahoo.comcannot imagine that two loving & sensible parents like the original characters of Pride & Prejudice could raise such dreadful children.  <br /> <br />The reason the younger Bennet girls were so ramshackle is that they were encouraged in folly by Mrs Bennet.

My favorite part was the son who kept asking for a bow and arrow set with every second breath- that at least rang true.<br /><br />It certainly was a brave attempt and obviously has succeeded with some, but I found it horribly unsatisfactory, crude, & dumb.<br /><br />Attempting tounge in cheek sexy romance but acheiving only corny porn.<br /><br />It's about 400 pages too long, and dwells with too much detail on everything, from the perfect physique of the Viking, his resemblance to a tree, and his great whopping 'tree like member'.<br /><br />How does one say such things in a review for Amazon? No matter that the book discusses it with every intimate scene. And there are many.<br /><br />Magnus the Virile Viking, something of a byword in his homeland on account of the many children delivered to his doorstep by various mothers, decides to outrun the laughter and launches his longboat with 9 remaining children (2 dead, 1 married and one left in charge at home).<br /><br />By incongrous mishap and the help of a chuckling whale, they end up on the lot of a Hollywood remake of \\"the Viking\\" where they encounter Angela. She's the heroine, and trying to broker a location deal with the producer to keep her family vineyard running.<br /><br />Of course they are instantly smitten and the whole viking troop ends up out at the vineyard and wiggle way into Angela & co. affections.<br /><br />Speaking of affections, the affectations of the constant rewording of things is belabored ad nauseum. Much effort is expended on constantly reminding the reader of the origins & differences of Magnus & children.<br /><br />This is the sort of novel my DB pal Amanda Richards could top without a pause, and I am sure the wit wouldn't be so belaboured or the people so dull.<br /><br />As for the bedroom scenes - they are described in constant graphic detail and one would heartily prefer not to think about them any further!<br /><br />kotori 2005hildren.  <br /> <br />This is the sort of novel my DB pal Amanda Richards could top without a pause, and I am sure the wit wouldn't be so belaboured or the people so dull.  <br /> <br />As for the bedroom scenes - they are described in constant graphic detail and one would heartily prefer not to think about them any further!  <br /> <br />kotori 2005 <br />	2005-04-11

Rather than remove those characteristics we have grown to love, they naturally unfold and in the most plausible fashion Wulfric is revealed for the man within the Dukes' mantle.<br /><br />As all his family has now wed and begun their own families, the Duke uncharacteristically accepts an invitation to a house party in the country.<br /><br />Once there he imediately clashes with country mouse Christine, who is a widowed relation of the family he is guesting with.<br /><br />A warm and vibrant girl he begins to find her extremely attractive and offers her a postition which no girl is flattered to recieve.<br /><br />As his heart slowly becomes involved, Balogh treats us to a very fine Sense and Sensibility or Pride & Prejudice like plot - so deftly written that one is not aware of the similarities until cross examining the plot for review :)<br /><br />Alas for my sleep! I began this book close enough to midnight, and was unable to set it aside until completed in the early hours of the morning.<br /><br />Probably my favorite of the series, which I have enjoyed to varying degrees, I found this one really carried me away to their world, and I became emotionally envolved with the hero & heroine. Of course, one was already deeply attached to the Duke, via his brief appearances in the previous tomes.<br /><br />Great read & highly recommended - wonderfully romantic! If you haven't read the others in the series this one does fine as a stand alone - don't read it first if you will go and read the others though, as it will really spoil the surprises.<br /><br />kotori ojadis@yahoo.com	2005-04-02

The City of Trees is threatened when the usual good weather turns to an icy chill, and everything begins to freeze. Nobody has any clues and as usual the Normal Citizens blame the Karmidee, leading to unrest and a political coo, as the Mayor is ousted from power and a violent & disreputable figure known as Councillor Bliss steps in.<br /><br />Other things are going wrong in the city as well - Mattie (known as 'Lumpy' by the less charitable) is left alone to manage the family wool shop, and a disreputable and very tiny figure has been seen on the premises, leaving miniscule footprints and small gifts. Have the elves become active?

Humans, lost on a space colonization mission, have settled on the Atevi world and exist in an uneasy truce, co-operating & trading only through one diplomat; Bren Cameron.<br /><br />As the only contact between two species, Cameron is constantly protected by an extraordinary security force but his family is not so fortunate.<br /><br />In a turbulent political climate on the human governed island, Camerons' family is endangered by radical factions & Yolanda Mercheson, the ships emissary has been threatened.<br /><br />Against this background he must somehow train (Jase)the new Atevi ship-human diplomat in the tangled Ragi tongue, which has no word for trust, or love or even like. Yes, human and Atevi are biologically different, and a man alone in an alien culture must constantly rethink his most basic suppositions.<br /><br />Jase & Cameron have made little headway after the initial friendliness of their contact & arrangements, but luckily Cameron's Atevi security have become his family.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of the stars, and one alien homeplanet where HUMANS are the alien threat, the `space opera' plays out.<br /><br />Well written, fast paced & enjoyable, an increasingly involving series. .<br /><br />Kotori  ojadis@yahoo.com	2005-02-28

A way that benefits all parties and alienates none.<br /><br />Plenty of political jockeying and even more intrigue and personal danger to Bren Cameron, Human interpreter to Atevi court, as well as danger and threat to those who protecet him.<br /><br />Personal relationsips are tangled as ever among the Atevi, and the scenery is a gorgeous backdrop. Relationships which were forged in the first book are hesitantly budding in the second, as the Atevi's Jago & Banichi are still protecting the human diplomat.<br /><br />Some have likened the Atevi & their world to feudal Japan, but while there are some similarities, they are faint and do not influence the whole Atevi culture. I find many more fresh and new concepts than the tired old Japanese/alien setting.<br /><br />The Atevi are distinctly different from humans, both in appearance & mentality. The landscapes and associations are foreign, and wholely fascinating.<br /><br />This second book passed rapidly and was a much more comfortable read. We were stuffed full with enough background/history & political knowledge in 'Foreigner:Bk 1' that we can relax somewhat through 'Invader' and read at a leisurely, and conversley, speedier pace.<br /><br />There are still the mental dialogues and much concern and second guessing on the paidhi Bren's part, but one has a feel for the writing and is able to skim or skip non relevant paragraphs/pages.<br /><br />Not the best series to start a Cherryh or sci-fi novice on, try rather the Chanur series, Mri wars, or Morgaine Saga.

The differences are vast, and language barriers abound.<br /><br />It was fascinating but also too long-winded, with too much time (IMHO) dwelling on how baffling it all was for Bren, and how a human couldn't relate to the emotionlessness of the Atevi...<br /><br />Story as follows: Human spacefarers venture out with a full crew compliment to set up a base - something goes wrong during the jump and they are thrown out beyond the known galaxy.  Alone and resourceless some of the passengers decide to settle the nearest habitable world, which also happens to be dwelt on by the Atevi, tall, ebon-hued humanlike species with some peculiar difference in society & habit.<br /><br />Assasination is a valid solution, and approved by courts in Atevi, and Bren as the ambassador to the Atevi is soon drawn into untangleable political games, with himself as the dupe.<br /><br />Loved the story, love the aliens, weakness, one humans disintigration away from the familiar, and the frequent waffling on of thought-trains.<br /><br />Believe a lot of the Atevi mindset needed to be included to set up future novels in series<br /><br />Kotori ojadis@yahoo.com	2005-02-23

In a private corner of the world the Karmidee have created a haven; The City of Trees. Built to accomodate all Karmidee (the four footed, the horned, the scaled & beclawed) this mystic city is their birthright.<br /><br />However, with humans among them, the magically gifted Karmidee have been usurped from their city and forced into poverty stricken encampments along the mud banks of the swamps.<br /><br />Now run by an increasingly hysterical government, \\"Normality\\" is the mantra, the rule and the goal.<br /><br />Things begin to look personally ominous for the Hush family when twins Hepzibah and (the delightfully named) Zeborah manifest their particular 'magico' talent of flying. They fly, they soar, they dribble and swim through the sky. Babysitters beware.<br /><br />The city is in peril, the family are being persecuted and Otto might be the closest thing the Karmidee have to a Prince!<br /><br />In a deft departure from the norm, not all is left in the hands of Otto and his friends. This isn't an instance of only children can save the day - instead, his parents, and friends all have roles to divert destiny.  Even the villians have excellent motivations, and the comeuppances are suitable.<br /><br />Imaginative & humorous, what a fantastic addition to the ranks of young adult fiction this book is.<br /><br />Fans of Garth Nix seventh tower series will find a lot to enjoy here.

On an alien world, the militant Mri co-exist with Regul in an arrangement of servitude, hiring as mercenaries for Regul protection and Regul wars.<br /><br />The fiercely honour based Mri society is failing, as Regul claim too many of their numbers in precipitous war against Humans.<br /><br />When Regul ceed Kesrith (Mri Homeworld)in the peace treaty, Mri future is jeopardized and they must contrive to somehow preserve their culture & species.<br /><br />The enclave at Kesrith has dwindled to 13 Mri, with only two young people left - brother and sister, Niun & Melein. Both have trained as Kel, superb warriors, but now Melein is elevated to leader.<br /><br />While Niun emerges from his adolescent dreaming and resentments, Melein must craft a future that can contain the Mri or obliterate them beyond reach of their enemies.<br /><br />A smooth beginning and slow unveiling of plot and motivations until in the last quarter, the tale picks up pace and hurtles along.<br /><br />The faded sun trilogy portrays two convincing & fascinating races locked with humans as the unpredictable element in a struggle for the stars and for mri, a struggle against extintion.<br /><br />It's great to read a book where the author doesn't hoard her characters, and I have no assurance that the people I'm getting attached to aren't going to die untimely.  It has no reassuring exploring the galaxy with Star Trek feel (don't get me wrong I am a trekkie sans t'shirt), and the characters are volatile and violent.<br /><br />A word to the wise: buy all three at once, because the cliff-hanger endings will leave your stomach in knots.<br /><br />Strongly urged reading!<br /><br />Kotori - ojadis@yahoo.com	2005-01-26

A very slender sequel.<br /><br />Marwen continues her adventures and must journey to seek her staff as the wizards heir, a position that is contested... by her old foe from Marmawell, a haunt from the past who may be more than he seems ... (bring on the music).. She has not yet witnessed Maug's tapestry (by folklore this means he is less than a person, lower than a slave, and extremly untrustworthy) although since the first book, Marwen has her own tapestry rewoven.<br /><br />However in her journey to seek out a staff, a new horror falls over the land, as Maug has stolen the Prism moon and seeks to control the world, and Marwen also.<br /><br />Not a whole lot of suspense, (thus I don't hesitate to disclose half the plot) but enjoyable and absorbingly written.<br /><br />This tiny tome is only 165pgs in full, and took a little under 3 hours to read - but a well spent few hours.<br /><br />Not frivolous, the telling leans to slow and misty imaginings, with occasions of blunt events and descriptions breaking up the pace a little.<br /><br />Every chapter is introduced with a bardic snippet. More often than not, they reveal exactly what is going to occur in the next pages, for those who look with a keen and knowing eye.<br /><br />Once again this book ends so conclusively it is difficult to believe that more awaits.<br /><br />A good follow up, and the romance between Marwen and her prince continues, to satisfy all the romantics amongst us. We are given a satisfactory conclusion and I await with interest where the third and final volume will lead.	2005-01-19

Sarah Mason seems to have taken some cues from Janet Evananovich's light handling of the love interests in the Stephanie Plum adventures, and adopted a similarly light & whimsical touch.<br /><br />It works very smoothly, easing us into the love story, whilst mostly being the story of one girls bumbling adventures.<br />And yes, also Bridget Jones overtones (Vol.1. not Vol 2!), as she is a bit clutzy and accident prone.  But who doesn't do that, these days?<br /><br />When reporter Holly Colshannon (!) gets an assignment to shadow a police detective, she goes to the job with a great deal of trepidation.  It's a big chance for her to get some articles published, and leave off reporting pet deaths for the weekly column.<br /><br />The supporting characters are all humorously drawn, and quite real, from her theatrical parents to her maritially inclined friend, Lizzie.<br /><br />Holly's arch enemies were occasionally sketched in charcoal, not pencil (a little heavy handed) but for the most part, this book is a delight.<br /><br />It was nice to get a little peak into the blues working day & I am partial to office scenes, particularly when they are as well written as this.  Liked the jokes, liked the camaraderie.<br /><br />The action moves along at a swift pace, preventing the reader from getting bored with the storylines or the characters, and Sarah Mason has a deft touch with the humour.<br /><br />Of course, I didn't think so initially, one of the first \\"funny\\" drama's in the book relating to items lodged in a delicate spot - but the novel improves, drastically.<br /><br />Being a gal who can never get her L's and R's straight, I was delighted to find a soulmate in Holly, who confesses to the same problemo!

The scene is set with an \\"Oldwife\\" (healer and almost-priestess) attending the birth of a daughter to Srill, an unmarried mother in a small village of Ve. An Oldwife is present at the birth of every child, to divine destiny and record it in a personal tapestry, which is a passport to acceptance.  Those without one, we are told, are considered 'soulless' and are outcasts from society.<br /><br />When Srill dies immediately after giving birth to the child (Marwen), for whom the Oldwife has forseen a dire future, & Oldwife adopts Marwen, out of affection for her mother & raises Marwen to know of her gifts & magic, as apprentice.<br /><br />Because the tapestry was so dire, it has been hidden from Marwen<br />and she has been ostracized by the villagers of Marmawell as soulless.<br />(I know! Names ?!)<br /><br />In her desire to prove herself, Marwen makes some horrifying mistakes, forcing her to start on her adventures.  As she travels she is faced with choices at every step, until eventually she must confront her destiny, and vanquish the dragon threatening the realm of Ve.<br /><br />Essentially a story of self-discovery, and latterly a tender love story, The Dragon's Tapestry is decorated with some very fine creatures and well conceived worlds. One of the most fascinating creatures are the \\"wingwand's\\" who seem to be some sort of butterfly/dragonfly amalgam, and are used for travelling - flying, rather. They are exquisitely described, and fascinating to imagine.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the thought, and detail put into this (single volume I thought, and now know it is a trilogy) tale. It is certainly a better realised plot & world than most small (the book is only 183odd pages, paperback) YA fantasy novels.<br /><br />Eagerly anticipating the other books, where we should see more of the romance, and certainly more of strong minded Marwen.<br /><br />kotori, Dec 2004 ojadis@yahoo.com	2004-12-07

Which she then plants and it turns into a fullgrown hazel tree. A bird roosts there and thereafter helps Cinders with her chores.<br /><br />Fairy godmother duly appears (with irridescent wings) & summons dress, pumpkin coachmen, as usual. Story continues on in usual fashion, and ends happily ever after.<br /><br />Other than the twig & bird, there is not a whole lot of improvisation, but that is fine, we need some traditional retellings of the old stories. It is staged with big hooped gowns & powdered wigs, buckled shoes and rich embroidery.<br /><br />What is exceptionally fine about this book is the paintings. They really are gloriously done, and have none of the insipidity of some of Sanderson's other works, such as The Tempest or so on.<br /><br />It seems that in allowing her style to be a little rougher, a little looser, artist has been able to express more freely the emotion moving her characters, and allow them more beauty than the simple faces usually portrayed. The control of lighting is excellent, and very pleasing.<br /><br />kotori Dec 2004 - ojadis@yahoo.com	2004-12-07

Their grandmother marches in demonstrations & lives with them.<br /><br />It's an easy to read book, with some great illustrations, and your children will love it.<br /><br />However, children generally don't need to be encouraged with precocity, for instance telling people \\"our granny has wobbly bottom\\" is not something I would encourage in my son.<br /><br />Depending on how broad-minded you and your family are - it's a very \\"modern\\" book, encouraging us to have no inhibitions, for example a grannie is pictured in her bra & underpants...<br /><br />I wouldn't dream of letting my grandmother see this book, but some (grannies)will find it warm & funny.<br /><br />I definately have mixed feelings about this book.

Calaban, a monster, is also allowed to share the island with them.<br /><br />In time, a ship comes by & Prospero is able to extract his revenge on his betrayors, & find a fine suitor for Miranda, forgive his brother and return to Milan.<br /><br />The oil paintings by Ruth Sanderson are finely detailed, and well wrought, for the most part.<br /><br />As a faint criticism, Miranda is very plain, but Sanderson's heroines often are.

When it's a story about a little boy who sees an elf at the bottom of the garden, who grows up into a larger sized little kid, still intimidated by his menacing step-dad, and daunted by his own uselessness and general futility of life, we know we are in for another Tom Holt variety show..<br /><br />With a Darth Vader step-dad and a loony mother, poor Michael doesn't have a great deal of back bone. But that's ok, beacuse his best friend at the mostly-boys-only school is Cruella, and she has attitude in spades.<br /><br />It seems that Daddy George (the Darth Vader step-dad) has enslaved a whole lot of elves to work in his shoe factory.  Altough it takes a lot to get Michael to the point of seeing himself as their saviour, he eventually (and with a lot of prodding from various plot contrivances, and baleful girls, not to mention saccharine elves) makes an attempt to find out and fix whatever his relatives have been up to.<br /><br />Being who and what he is (a monumental screw up of the kind only teenage and gormless boys seem to acheive), the operation is doomed to failure, a fact he recognizes from the outset.<br /><br />Slow in places, and at times a little too carried away with describing the interminable boredom in interminable detail, this book is nontheless very enjoyable.<br /><br />Through reading, I've been moved to push quotes from the book upon people.<br /><br />Michael is very reminiscent of Prachett's Rincewind, only done in Holt fashion.  The spineless acceptance of fate & realization of his place on the food chain make them very similar.<br /><br />Holt imbues a waft of romance to the book via Cruella, and it's refreshing (The Portable Door has been his other major excursion into \\"happily ever afters\\") only I felt at the end of the book he has somewhat betrayed his characters the ending they deserved.<br /><br />It's as if Holt was happy writing the middle and just before the ending experienced a disappointment that forced him to conclude the book on bitter note, instead of the humorous twist which he usually leaves the reader with.<br /><br />A poignant paragraph:<br /><br />\\"..difference between romance and real life.

He looks like a young mel gibson, fresh from the set of Gallipoli, and it's quite amusing. One of the wonderful things the author has done is make this book so quirky.<br /><br />Ella doesn't have a perfect sylph-like figure merely hidden by soot, instead she's redheaded, with corky curls and a plump little body, which when tucked into a more suitable gown, looks just fine.<br /><br />It's her personality which wins the Duke over and brings him around begging for her hand. And dear Ella takes a good look around her and realises that it's Buttons she really want's, and they take off, and set up their own dress shop.<br /><br />The illustrations are fantastic, and as written in the back of the book, the ball scenes were inspired by the dance sequences in the R.K.O. Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers movies.<br />The dresses are Shirley Hughes original designs, inspired by the French couturiers of the 1920's, Doucet, Poiret and Patou.<br /><br />Just love it.<br />Ages 8+ would most appreciate this book, although certainly any age will happily sit through it.<br /><br />For you it makes an entertaing bedtime story.<br />For them, the same, and a little twist to the regular fairytale.<br />Kotori Nov 2004	2004-11-28

He takes it home and we get to see through the descriptions of the author and the paintings from the artist(Georg Hallensleben)the fascinating history of the humble rock.<br /><br />After exploding out of a fiery volcano and witnessing the dinosaurs, being submerged in an ice cap, used as a cave, and<br /><br />\\"centuries of rain and wind<br /><br />had worn away the rock,<br /><br />changing it's shape and form\\"<br /><br />and so on<br /><br />\\"or that by the light of a full moon,<br /><br />the rock had been thrust onto the beach<br /><br />But when the boy held the rock in his hand<br /><br />and felt it's warmth, he knew that it was<br /><br />a gift from the sea. \\"<br /><br />Exploring the transmutations of humble objects we would think no further on,I think this book would appeal to all philosophers youthful or aged.<br /><br />The painted illustrations are in full and glorious colour, exploding onto the page & filling every corner, imbuing this profund book with a depth and meaning rarely explored.<br /><br />As a final footnote, I would heartily recommend this book for purchasing.<br /><br />Kotori	2004-11-27

Not to mention a vindictively vicious Stepmother!<br />The story is charming, and even more interesting, at the end in a series of postscripts from the authors, they reveal that the book was written  in a game,AS A SERIES OF LETTERS (just as presented in the book)without discussing the plot, the characters, or anything further to the construction of the next letter. A bit like that game where you add on the next sentence, but they have created a marvellous world.<br />As P.C. Wrede started the first letter, it is based on her Mairelon the Magician books, which were also set in a magic-infused Regency England. What fun! Can't wait to read the next one.	2004-11-24

It depends on your focus. If you can be bothered, I note a lot of people like to make these sorts of little fiddlies and gift them.<br /><br />I was very interested in the quilted pattern for the placemats - a delightful traditional japanese style.<br /><br />There is a separate section for Gifts and Decorations containing yet more fiddly bags, and oddly enough, a garland.

Inspired by Mozart's `Die Zauberflote' (The magic flute), she has crafted a newly emerging world, and a warring dynasty.  Title of first chapter: A House Divided.<br /><br />The fantasy sweeps you away whilst the touches of whimsy and quick humor remind that this is a book for young people, a book to grin at, before moving on in the grand adventure.<br /><br />The first chapters dwelling on details of Mina's life, growing with a companion, beautifully described & fleshed out `Lapin', her relations with her mother (Queen of the Night).

Short and sweet?

He delights in the details eg mama closes up a PET shop, gets WET with rain, the boys play with their TRAIN set.<br /><br />It starts like this:<br /><br />The clock goes ticktock on the wall.<br />The phone is ringing down the hall.<br />Shops are closing for the day.<br />Mama's coming home.<br /><br />The Mama's coming home refrain is repeated on every second page and there is an illustration of where she is and what she's doing, in comparasion to the doings at the house.<br /><br />It would be a nice little adjuster for any child who doesn't understand \\"whyyyy\\" he has to wait for mommy or papa to arrive.

Let me not pretend to be too highbrow -I loved this book.<br />Not a careful purchase, but stacked onto my library pile as a last minute addition with that sangfroid of knowing if it was a bore it would just go back next trip, no pressure... and I was predisposed to dislike it, on account of \\"bitchy\\" heroine blurb on back cover.<br /><br />Summation: Improbably named Sugar Beth must return to her hometown to reclaim her inheritance.<br /><br />Unfortunately she doesn't have a whole lot of friends left in the town she once dominated.  And she doesn't have a whole lot of success to ride back in on.  Three failed marriages behind her and the last marking her as an Anna Nicole Smith type gold digger give her a lot to be ashamed of.<br /><br />What is likeable about her character is the sheer nerve with which she carries all off. I would hope I would have similar backbone, & personal honour.  In a good little pointer, SB explains it as `personal power' when having a discussion with her estranged niece.<br /><br />Particularly appealing is the character the author has created in Sugar Beth.<br /><br />OK THE NAME!!! It's bad, but you move beyond it.<br /><br />I approached this book with extreme caution thinking I was going to hate the main character but in fact she shows more tolerance and humility than the people she victimized.<br /><br />I loved the descriptions of small town life, and this book made it so real for me, although I have no familiarity or experience with the area's in which it is set.<br /><br />There is soaring romance, and I was crying so many times as I read this book. What moved me was not some overly dramatic this person dies blah blah.  Instead it was really well written scenes of the sort of day-to-day pathos everyone has to endure in their lives.<br /><br />The other thing is: It's Very Funny.<br />WARNING: YOU WILL LAUGH it's not a sad book; it's a joyful read, and I felt thrilled, happy & completed, when I completed it.<br />kotori ojadis@yahoo.comt thrilled, happy & completed, when I completed it.   kotori ojadis@yahoo.com	2004-11-02

Beginning after the events of \\"The Wee Free Men\\", \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" centers on Tiffany Aching, and her efforts to properly learn witching.  The event's occur within the DiscWorld.  The Nac Mac Feegles' once again make their presence felt, in the purportining of various items & general odour.. and are absolutely brilliant.  Tiffany herself is a more lacklustre, whilst Death briefly manifests.<br /><br />So the first half of the book moves along joyfully, with Tiffany leaving the Chalk and apprenticing to a witch who is about double what she seems.  The antics of the Nac Mac Feegle got spurts of laughter from me, most notably the scene wherein many little men make one large... thing.<br /><br />They follow Tiffany in order to protect her from a creature which they know to be unbeatable, after an initical hiccup with their new Kelda who is Rob Anybody new wife.<br /><br />The method of travel is colourful and beguiles away a good few chapters, with usual TP wit and verve.<br /><br />When it comes to the battle, the NMC are shunted aside to focus further on Tiffany, which is unfortunate as I found her transformation into a narcissitic pre-teen whilst possibly true to life, not at all entertaining.<br /><br />The book also has too many half endings, before actually concluding, & Granny Weatherwax figuring in the preceedings at some point.<br /><br />It was with some disappointment that I concluded the book & realised that I had not enjoyed it as much as anticipated.  It would seem this book has been more written for the pre-teens than the previous, and not at all necessarily.  Here goes a family anecdote: My siblings practically started reading on TP's books, first with Carpet People & Truckers & Diggers, & then onto the more DiscWorld when they were still 10-14. I do believe he is the only reason they are semi-literate today...<br /><br />Summation: Naturally it was enjoyable, with the authorship of TP, but not as much as even Maurice and His Amazing Educated Rodents, which was also a book for young readers.  Loved the first half, impatiently read through the last.he first half, impatiently read through the last.	2004-10-20

It was sorely disappointing yet I kept reading, like probing a sore tooth!<br /><br />The first book was not very good, the repartee is getting dull and standard as well as every character seeming to be a cardboard copy of those who have gone before - just about every man is an amalgam of Belgarath/Silk/Sparhawk/Barak etc etc- with none of the warmth, humor and originality that made them all such lovable characters. (the women are either Polgara's or the rather nauseating Elenia character childgoddesses)<br /><br />In this book:<br />Zelana's domain has been secured from the invasion of the servants of insect-like overmind the VLAGH but now her brother Veltan is having a premonition of trouble along his borders.  The Dreamers have dreamt of 2 invasions and a great deal of chaos.<br /><br />Sadly the characters may as well be interchangable because they all have the same supposed to be dry humor but now standard overdone satire. This makes it hard to follow the conversations, as they all reads like one long monologue.<br /><br />Is it because I read that Eddings book (was it the Rivan Codex?) where the Authors described their formula for writing? I cannot believe that the reason this book is so stale.<br /><br />Every passage is described in at least three ways before we are allowed to move on, and the authors will always take the opportunity to retell a plot direction ie battle tactic, at least 3 times.  As if this was not enough interminable repetition, I discovered to my horror around the 6th chapter that the past chapters & events are retold from different viewpoints.<br />The authors take this opportunity to describe origins and motives, (which seem to be similarly interchangable)and then go on to relate, in torturous detail, the past months happenings.<br /><br />This is repeated at least 6 times and what makes this so boring instead of interesting, is we already know exactly what happens and has happened on account of it being described at least 3 times in great detail from one character to another already. . .<br /><br />Is my review beginning to sound repetitive? Perhaps it's an infectious virus...<br /><br />So. The child/dreamers are vile little know-it-alls, as well as being revoltingly snide, whilst at the same time that usual gooey sweetness (eg: \\"well I'm always right, now give me a kiss-kiss\\").. Urgh.<br />Still the children are also the most likeable figures, but are only briefly aired*<br /><br />The mysterious benefactor we know exactly who it is.<br /><br />The only arch villian appears in bug form, and alas we only hear his voice through roars. I am sure if the authors gave him a voice it would be full or the same sort of overblown sardony with which every other character speaks.<br /><br />Can I bear to review my beloved David Eddings this badly? I think I must.<br /><br />If you borrow it from the library you will be disappointed but not as much as if you brought it... I purchased this book at the airport to read on the plane and now, 5 months later I have read it, but it's not a page-turner.<br /><br />Poor show from David Eddings and I must say I feel that his books have taken a turn for the worse since Leigh Eddings began to be credited as authoring.<br /><br />It is still more enjoyable than some really poor grade fantasy books and my rating of 2 stars is in comparason to other Eddings books, not what is on the market.<br />The plot is quite good, the characters, were they depicted less stiltedly are still good, and I will read part 3, bc I'm hoping that a little bit further into the series they might pick up the pace a little?<br /><br />I also confess to being intrigued with whether any of these dopey or dull men are intended for the ladies -  the only girls are the goddesses & Ara, wife of stodgy farmer Omago who invents the spear? and various other weaponry.<br /><br />*perhaps the authors are saving that for a separate book - book 2, point of view of dreamers??<br /><br />Readers will find an interesting conclusion to the book wherein it seems that the armies needen't have been gathered at all, if only everyone had done a little more communicating. This may seem a bizzare statement to make, as I have already complained about the excessive and repetitive conversations, but there you go.

Grace & Honour are popular acknowledged beauties both a little intimidated by their father and they come to Beauty for any problems... She helps her sisters with their love lives and intercedes with daddy... She is much loved.<br /><br />Both the men Grace and Honour fall in love with are absolutely lovely, as are the girls, whose characters we see grow as they must move to the country.<br /><br />Settling in the country in the most exquisite house (I want a house bordered by a Great Forest, a possibly enchanted brook and covered in rambling roses!! And a dear little garden with a shed for the horses...) which just happens to be abandoned by the last smith and they have a new home.  Of course, the Great Forest is enchanted, and in the usual way Father gets lost on way home from town, coming across the BEASTS castle... and so on and so on.<br /><br />This is the most wonderful retelling of it, and although I loved the Disney version, they could have taken even more from this retelling. I believe quite a lot of the Disney version was based on this retelling, and it certainly preceeded the Disney movie, but it is much more enchanting.<br /><br />Please read this book you will be making a lifelong friend!	2004-10-04

She is rejected and vilified, avoided even by her blood kin.<br /><br />At just the right pace, author reveals there is more to Brigets story than solitary Briget is aware.<br /><br />Other realms are reaching into hers, and entangling her in their own plots, which culminate when a man comes to her one dark night to bring her ask for help.<br /><br />Isavalta.

Rose is the last child, and her mother is determined that she not wander, as her birth direction calls her.<br /><br />When an out of place polar bear rescues Rose it signals the true beginning of her adventures which will demand much bravery & courage<br /><br />So we are introduced to our story.<br /><br />With shades of Snow White & Rose Red, and the bear, hints of The Magic Flute, and nuances of the Ice Queen, Edith Pattou has created a fabulous and mythical composition of riviting reading, sheer escapism.<br /><br />Gritty whilst still being dreamy and romantic, I find this book on par with favorites like Cameron Dokeys Beauty Sleep, or Robin McKinleys books, such as Beauty or A door in the Hedge...	2004-09-19

Well, Juliana is viewed as such at the start of the book by other characters but proves slowly that she is not as black as she is painted.<br /><br />As the siblings of the hero fall in love with her(and they do) so do we, and so are we convinced that she is worth more than her rakehell name.  In fact she is quite infamous, but all is slowly revealed and her truly tender heart shines, amongst all her bad pranks.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever drunk too much at office parties or made a spectacle of themselves out at the bar or even been grossly rude whenever in the mood (etc etc I could go on but I'm sure you get the picture)...will cringe for her in this story, and be very satisfied when it is all overlooked in the end, by everyone who counts.	2004-09-19

When I got it I expected another regency/georgian novel, and was quite surprised to read on...<br /><br />The heroine exudes real warmth and humor. She is married to a swanky british aristocrat living in a country manor. When war comes (world war II), the grand old house must be turned into a impromptu hospital/base for the soldiers.<br /><br />She loves her husband but he is away, maybe dead, and a charming american pilot (slowly and convincingly) falls in love with her.<br /><br />Well I have described the plot very roughly and it might sound a bit dull, but I must assure you this is the most engrossing & fantastic novel!  And I will not reveal any more than I have, lest I ruin the delightful unveiling of the story.<br /><br />I absolutely sobbed in parts, and rejoiced in others, ending the book on a very upbeat note. . . A MUST READ. . .<br /><br />I Adore P.Veryan, she is the greatest regency author today, consistently delivering believable characters and intriguing plots and BELOVED hero's/heroines...	2004-08-20

This is another great entry into the golden chronicles, with new characters introduced who are entirely lovable in themselves.<br /><br />Old favorites make an appearance, as they continue to do throughout this series.  Wonderful Jamie and Haughty August come through the town and we have some brillant scenes between the two of them along with the duel threats that come whenever August is involved. (are you sensing the infatuation? My favorite character! Mandarin of Mayfair is his book)...<br /><br />So we have a great pair of new lovers, and continuing relationships with our favorite people who haven't made the perfect match yet.<br /><br />Down to the nitty gritty:<br /><br />Jennifer Britewell is a lovely heroine & her kindness to the man who has lost his memory is entirely believeable and in keeping with her proven nature.<br /><br />As he struggles to regain his memory and they are threatened by savage strangers who desire her home (which is slightly decrepit but very scenic)they are thrown together and romance developes.<br /><br />One of the marvellous things about Patricia Veryan as an author is the very believability of her settings. Without boring one with the visitors guidebook, or banging us over the head with the history of a place, she manages to imbue her books with the very feel of the environs.<br /><br />Windswept Cornwall descends into your living room as you read this book, and Jonathon & Jennifer are wonderful.<br /><br />Romances are always incredibly touching & leavened with gentle humor:<br />\\"Jennifer, please stop! My beautiful... dearest girl... I cannot bear to see you cry.\\"<br />At this, her eyes opened very wide. \\"You-you're weeping, too...\\" she gulped.<br />\\"I know,\\" he said. And lost to everything but her grief, added with a tender smile, \\"You hit me in the eye.\\"<br /><br />heh heh<br />ABSOLUTELY BRILLANT. Read all her books. Veryan is the best regency/georgian author.	2004-08-20

Enchanting regency with the action centering on, as the title suggests, daughter of the black sheep of the family.<br /><br />She returns to England looking to make a marriage but has a great deal of past which needs to be swept under the carpet.<br /><br />It's been a LOOOONG time since I read this book, but as I remember, her mother was an opera singer (?) and notorious.<br /><br />What I DO remember is that it is written with a great deal of verve and wit, making it an enjoyable jewel of a book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-08-19

Vevila (- specifically named to include -evil- ?) is the only \\"real\\" princess and she is as unorthodox as possible, so much so that the King has specifically created laws that his son is unable to marry Vevila, which is what gives the prince the impetus to pursue his adventure.<br /><br />Characters like the magicians add humor, although it occasionally seems to digress too much and leave some characters hanging, they do have their own charm.<br /><br />I found Rueberry a particularly likeable individual, with his penchant for remembering meals and extra wheels of cheese.<br />The punning involved with a certain wizard cursed to find a Shakespearian quote for every occasion is amusing, and as the quotes are frequently obscure trying to place them can be entertaining.<br /><br />Certain characters could have been explored in more depth although then the book could loose it's frivolous feel, which mayn't have been a bad thing.<br /><br />In the end I was expecting Ureceacea(sp? how does one pronounce that!) to be revealed as more than the sum of her parts, but nothing happens which is a bit of a let down.<br /><br />I realised I was expecting some sort of \\"Howls Moving Castle; Sophie\\" type transformation, but the author does not go so far.<br />I would rate it 3 stars, and would read other books by this author.<br />Would like to see further adventures of the subsidiary characters (although all the characters seem to be subsidiary characters with no clearly defined lead, but hopping from one set to another).<br /><br />Still, it was enjoyable, just not riveting - example, I was willing to put it down half way and go to sleep at a reasonable hour, rather than staying up until every last page was turned.<br />Kotoriaying up until every last page was turned.

Sadly they are not very readily available in AUST. However if you're from the US that's not a problem.<br />This is the first in the series, and I read it as a retrospective, not being able to find a copy until far past finishing the set.<br />Although not my favorite, it is still very well written and engrossing.<br />I would call it a delightful coming of age story, as the sister who is a cripple (and I hope I'm remembering this right!)finds that with love and away from the threatening sphere of Jean Claude she blossoms.<br />Hmm not a very good review, but mainly I would like to urge you to read it for yourself.<br />Follow with all the Sanguinets Crown &amp; Golden Chronicles - PVeryan is GREAT!	2003-05-23

Fascinating.<br />this offering from Kurtz reads fine as a stand alone novel.<br />How can I mention, without sounding soppy, that I cried for CHAPTERS of this book?  You will find yourself so deeply involved with the characters that tears are inevitable, but it is not a particularly tragic book.  As I had not read the previous books for some while, I found myself more in sympathy with Kelsons proposed bride, than his &quot;one true love and soulmate later revealed not to be so true or so souly&quot;.<br />So although in parts it leaves you dry throated and wet eyed, it has moments of glorious triumph and humor.<br />You have to read it, if you haven't already.	2003-03-16

For reasons revealed in the book, Torina must flee her fathers realm, alone and friendless.<br /><br />Landen (in a style similiar to Guy Gavriel Kay's book \\"Tigana\\") is the son of a conqured realm, taken hostage by Torina's father at a young age.<br /><br />The way in which a relationship is developed by Landen and Torina is convincing, whilst the background characters like the evil Vesputo, suitably threatening and all-pervasive.<br /><br />For a while there you really think she's going to fall for the wrong guy twice! Naturally all ends well.<br /><br />I recommend you leave a bit of a gap between finishing this book and beginning her second book set in the same world, \\"Healers Keep\\", or be bitterly disappointed.	2003-03-15

As a mother myself, I can never imagine that the outrageousness of Edgerton lying about Mariannes wherabouts would be so little examined!  Basically, he killed her because at any point that day the next or the next, he could have saved her life by telling someone where she was.<br />Also, when a life was involved, surely everyone would have been involved in a search party, and as a mother! I would have been searching the attic myself not relying upon the servants to do it!  I can't believe that they would just accept as easily as that, when everyone would have been anxious and frantic and surely checking over twice what they had checked before!<br />That, to me, is the worst and most letting down feature of the book.  I hated that it ended like that.<br />It was also not made much of, when it came to light.	2002-12-22

The world seems to be well thought out, the action is reasonable and nothing (except the writing) is too corny... The book is completely undermined by the boring prose and the prosaic bores.<br />Now I do not enjoy an author who does not trust the reader enough to allow him to read between the lines. There are no lines to read between in this book. Every sentence is written in a very stilted fashion, and Irvine constantly interrupts his flow with an aside that would, given time, have become perfectly obvious.<br />It seems Irvine was too attached to his work, too anxiously trying to control what the reader thinks and imagines whilst reading, leaving the book contrived and overwritten.<br />So although I will probably wonder what happens, (it does SOUND interesting, it just doesn't READ interesting) I couldn't bear to read and find out.	2002-09-26

This book is utterly incomprehensible and however much poetry and flowery words it is overflowing with, remains daft.<br />What am I trying to say? A moment to order my thoughts.  That book ought to have taken similar.  The author does not seem to have taken a moment or even longer, to order hers. How can you get drawn into a story when you really can't understand what the heck is going on? veiled references to folklore we don't know, it's like a nightmare-dream where the book just ISN&quot;T MAKING SENSE.<br />I can understand how an author could do that, leave you with just a hazy notion that it's all interesting and exciting, but they must at leave you with enough of a feeling of familiararity or attachement to the characters to keep on reading.  I got to page 48 and stopped (feeling herioc to have gotten this far).  Now normally I'm a trojan reader, can read anything, dictionaries to poetry blah blah blah However I had no desire to keep reading this book and THAT in my opinion, says a great deal about the book.<br />This is my very biased review of the book and there must be a lot of people who disagree, as this author is very popular.  Stephen Donaldson gives a recommendation - &amp; I greatly admire him. But I couldn't get into it. I may try again, one day.	2002-08-23

This book is worth reading for it's unpretentious recounting of rather extraordinary events.  You will come to enjoy the whimsical characters and the ridiculous and bizarre world she inhabits, and jolly well end up liking her very much indeed.<br />I must say when I read this book I was reminded of myself in all my bumbling glory and Tanith Lee makes no effort to put her heroine up there with the usual pedestalled and dainty princess' nor with the heroic axe swinging warrior type amazons of other books which are all well and good, in a very liberated way, but a ordinary girl like Claidi is wonderfully refreshing and very likeable.<br />Have not yet read part 3 but part two was an absolute delight.<br />Not just for young adults but this book will be enjoyed by anyone who has  wondered what would happen if adventure really did come to them?<br />I must also recommend TL's other series Red, Gold & Black Unicorn which are excellent although a little more fantastical than this.

If you are young, romantic, impressionable, warning! You are about to have a hero (Tarod) for life!

And wasn't that just the best album they produced?  I believe this series is LC's most outstanding trilogy.. it is achingly beautiful and impossibly tragic...<br />Okay I hope I'm not putting you off it here, but honestly, this is still one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read more than a few. For similarly smashing books, see my so you want to list...<br />Read the book and then write you can write your own overly gushy &amp; cringe worthy descriptions trying to capture it's essence, and convince others to read it.

And so the course of two people who might otherwise have gotten along very well, takes nearly a full novel to fill.<br /><br />If you are, like me, a fan of the genre then you are probably already a Patricia Veryan addict, and if you aren't yet, then you will be.<br /><br />I recommend all of her books unreservedly.<br />The Jewelled men series is absolutely delightful as are the Georgian romances.<br /><br />Anyway no need to blab on, the gist of it is, Veryan is the best Regency author around.

Although not as poignant as it's predecessor, Howls Moving Castle, Castle in the Air is nonetheless very readable and makes one just as reluctant to put it down.  Sophie and Howl are revisited in this book, but it isn't properly a sequel for them as it deals with entirely different characters. Remember the skeleton hopping broom man? Well he features large.<br />Grouchy genies & princesses of all ages, DWJ mixes them all up for this delightful spoof.
