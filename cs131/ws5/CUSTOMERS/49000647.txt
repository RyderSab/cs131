Despite the rather cute title (one of a series of similarly named books from Copernicus Books), this book is a serious look at the life of bees, written for the non-scientist.<br />    The book opens with an overview of bees and their place in the animal kingdom and throughout earth's history and moves on to:<br />  The bee as an insect, examining its anatomy and abilities<BR>  The social life of bees, looking at bees in larger social structures, family associations, within the colony and classification systems<br />  The traits of bees<br />   Solitary bees and their social development (or lack thereof)<BR>   <BR>Bumblebees and stingless bees<br />  The types of bees and where they fit in, including a look at honeybee language, the development of new hives and sensory abilities.<br />  At all times, the book is intelligently written, easily read by the layman while also offering serious bits of science to those who want to know more. Any reader can learn a lot from this book. For example, I never knew there was such a thing as a stingless bee.  Sounds harmless, right? Ha! Here's what author Karl  Weiss says about them:<br /> &lt;I&gt;Stingless bees are not defenseless, though....If a curious person comes too close to their nest, he can be badly injured. The disturbed bees hurl themselves at him and bite him in the skin and hair, holding on tightly. In addition, some species spray a sticky, acrid secretion from their mandibular glands into the bite wounds that can leave permanent scars. Thus, fire bees or hair-cutting bees are fitting names for these species.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;<br /> Hmm, just want you want buzzing around your backyard.<BR>The book contains numerous black-and-white illustrations showing bee anatomy, hive construction, nest development and honeycombs. While none of the illustrations are fancy or colorful, all are worth examination. <br />Weiss is an entomologist and the director of the Bavarian Beekeeping Institute at Erlangen, Germany.  His co-author, entomologist Carlos  H. Vergara,  is from the Universidad de las Americas, in Puebla, Mexico.	2002-12-28

The book's tips on writing clearly and for the reader of the office memo or e-mail are direct, short and to the point. <br /> It doesn't waste words but it doesn't omit a lot of topics, either. For example, a memo writer is reminded to &quot;write as you speak--if you speak clearly.&quot; Thousands, no, millions, of words have been devoted to this topic. This one sentence sums it up nicely.<br />Some may quibble with minor points in the book. For example, it advises readers not to capitalize the &quot;The&quot; in newspaper names because some papers use a &quot;the&quot; and some don't. To my way of thinking (and training), that's a question easily resolved by finding out what the newspaper uses. But this is a tiny point.<br /> I much prefer the authors' valuable and wide-ranging bits of information: <br />khan: lowercase this term, which is a title for a ruler, an official or an important person in India and some central Asian countries. <br />c.o.d.: Use c.o.d. with periods for all references. It stands for cash on delivery. Without periods, it could be confused with the word cod, as in fish.<BR> saccharin/saccharine: Often misspelled. The first is a sugar substitute; the second means overly sweet. <br />And so on, touching on topics from A to Z, as billed. I highly recommend this book.	2002-12-28

(I put myself in the second category, those who need to practice spontaneity). Neither do I make fun who might find the book useful because we could all use a new idea occasionally. I suspect there are many people who don't need this advice on a day-to-day basis, though may occasionally just be stumped for a new idea, but for the rest of us, the book offers its promised 101 tips of sending an unmistakable message of love to a child (and could be adapted for grown-up children, I think.) <br />Aside from the good ideas, the major strength of this book is that it doesn't lecture but instead delivers ideas in very short doses, one or two sentences at the most, an idea per page, with easy-to-do suggestions. Some require a little more effort than others, such as preparing &quot;coupons&quot; for a hug or a kiss, but most are extremely easy to do, and require only a moment or two of time, and the desire to show love. <br />There is something for everyone here, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, grandparents, stay-at-homes or career parents, or anyone who wants to deliver the message to a child. Not every idea will be of interest to every person, but even a handful of them, tried occasionally or often, will help a child get the word. <br />Here are just a few: <br />See how many words you and your child can make from the letters I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U. <br />Leave surprise love notes in unexpected places, such as the bathroom mirror or the front door. <br />Mail a letter or a card to your child, even if you haven't gone away. Getting mail is a special event for children. <br />Go for a walk in the moonlight, or in a new snowfall or even a warm summer rain. <br />Make a heartshaped I LOVE YOU puzzle. Write your message of love on the cardboard and then cut it into pieces so your child can put it back together. <br />Wake your child with a kiss. <br />Let your child &quot;accidentally&quot; overhear you singing their praises to others. (My daughter pretends to object to this, claiming she hates it when parents talk about their children with other parents, but, luckily for me, I see the secret smile of pleasure.) <br />And, the clincher: Make a will naming a guardian or executor. It is the most loving and thoughtful thing you can do for a child. <br />I've personally tried many of these, and found them hugely helpful when just a simple &quot;I love you&quot; isn't enough. Some I'd actually thought of myself!!--such as making up a simple song featuring her name or going for a walk in the rain or moonlight. <br />She quickly caught on to one little ritual I started, which was to list two or three or four things I loved about her, or that she had done especially well, each night as I tucked her in. Very soon my list was interrupted with, &quot;And what else?&quot; &quot;And what else?&quot; <br />Kids love love is the message I take from that. It's so simple. Offer this book to anyone who has, or once was, a child.	2002-12-11

Fowler, John Bremner or Theodore Bernstein, but don't need the posturing or pomposity that sometimes accompanies columns or books on language, or those who simply enjoy wandering through the pages of a book that examines and comments upon commas, virgules, variants, Bryan A. Garner's Dictionary of Modern American Usage is the book to read. <br />Garner takes on all manner of problems, from the proper way to use the word each, to Hobson's Choice, to ordinance vs. ordnance and hundreds of other misuses and misunderstandings about American usage. <br />Most entries are quite short, as in the notation that \\"meld together\\" is a redundancy, while others, such as the entry on mendacity/mendicity/mendicancy, detail the distinctions that should be made in using these similar-sounding words. Most entries are accompanied by good, contemporary examples, but are sometimes explained through citations of older works. <br />The book is quite long,707 pages of entries in the hardcover edition, but worth the time of anyone who wants to brush up language skills, rediscover old rules, dispose of some other old rules, or broaden understanding of the differences between American and British usage. <br />Garner frequently cites newspapers and magazines when pointing out correct usage or mistakes, which makes the material fresh and relevant: <br />Comprise and compose: If the whole comprises the parts, the reverse can't be true, e.g., \\"Of the 50 stocks that comprise the index, 40 had gains...\\", From Florida Today, June 15, 1997. <br />In other words, comprise is not synonymous with \\"make up\\", no matter how many times people use it incorrectly. <br />extradite, indict, the former meaning to surrender or deliver a fugitive to anotherjurisdiction, the latter from the Latin to \\"write down\\" but some write as if the words are related, e.g., Ventura has a court hearing Thursday in San Juan, where she is expected to waive her right to fight extradiction (read extradition)...\\" From the Boston Herald, Oct.4, 1994. <br />and <br />Prosecutors argued that..he had jumped bail after a 1984 federal mail-fraud conviction and disappeared for nine years until being found and extradicted (read extradited)...\\" From The New York Times, Oct.7, 1994. <br />deceptive, deceptious. The latter is a needless variant. Or, if we have a perfectly good word, we don't need the invented alternative, which just causes readers to pause wonder about its meaning. <br />He also provides some useful definitions I've not encountered before, for example: dysphemism, the substitution of a disagreeable word or phrase for a neutral or even positive one. It is the opposite of euphemism. Some examples: <BR>bean counter for accountant <BR>jock for athlete <BR>jarhead for Marine <BR>bleeding heart for liberal <BR>sawbones for surgeon <BR>mouthpiece for lawyer <BR>nerd for intellectual <BR>stiff for cadaver <BR>fascist for conservative <br />This book serves as a ready reference and a guide to those who love English. It's worth its hefty price.	2002-12-11

Sorry, that's tacky. How about, made me want to slap the author?<br />There are two reasons. It is absolutely beyond understanding why writers so often want to put themselves in the center of the story when they aren't part of the story. Grr. Yes, sometimes they are, and yes, perhaps a little \\"me-ism\\" is appropriate, occasionally, once in a while, when absolutely necessary.<br />In other words, just a little.<br />But this story about the murderous path of one Richard Caputo is really all about the writer's experiences in writing about Caputo. That's not to say there's nothing about him, of course, because there is. But I really don't care about how Linda Wolfe had to race across town to get to the lawyer's office just in time. Really.<br />Por ejemplo:<br />\\"The area around most courthouses, except in Manhattan where the courts are cheek by jowl with Chinatown, is a culinary wasteland. So I didn't expect to find a decent restaurant. I just left the building, ran through the cold, stll-pelting rain and entered the first eatery I encountered. It was an Asian lunch counter where the food, precooked and displayed in warming trays, looked gluey and unidentifiable. I ordered something the counterman said was chicken and vegetables and started to put it down on a table, when suddenly I noticed Kennedy (the defense lawyer she's been trying to reach) behind me. He too had chosen this closest-at-hand canteen.<br />What good fortune! I suggested we eat together. \\"Maybe we could do that interview about your past,\\" I said.<br />\\"My past? I don't think I want to talk about that over lunch,\\" he frowned. It might make me sick.\\"<br />\\"Maybe,\\" I laughed, \\"we can find other things to talk about.\\"<br />\\"Sure.\\"<br />And so on. And so on, semi-remembered details about unimportant moments that put the author into the center of the story. You see, it would be okay if these personal details added something to the story,but they don't. This How I Got That Story approach reeks of self-absorption, and not very incisive absorption at that.<br />Wolfe is better at other times, even while injecting herself into the story. For example, when she contacts and meets Caputo's wealthy brother and describes her fears--does his sociopathic behavior run in the family?, she wonders--the first-person approach works a little better. In Wolfe's case, there's some legitimate reason for starting on the first-person approach--she knew one of the victims, and sets off to track the killer. But she gets so caught up in herself that we lose track of the victims, and so her hard work in collecting information is buried under the Me details.<br />Second, there's not enough depth here. A real, live serial killer who committed his crimes through his ability to wine and dine, con, control and ultimately murder one woman after another would seem to be prime ground for writing and reporting. Caputo is a fascinating and frightening character. For the record, Caputo was an immigrant from Argentina who admitted to murdering four women, though he's suspected of committing far more. He moved his Don Juan act around the country and to Mexico.<br />On his journey, he conned plenty of people, not just the victims but often their families, friends and work colleagues, most of whom fell for his charming styles until his murderous instincts got the better of him. And his killings occurred over a period of two decades, an unusually long time for a serial killer to operate.<br />Wolfe does come up with some interesting details: Caputo's childhood fascination with rape, his [] attempt to portray himself as a victim of abuse and even a victim of his victims, his charm and the failings of the judicial and psychiatric system to put him away before he could kill again.<br />But this book just doesn't quite cut it. Maybe, in emulating this book, I could write a book on her book, using the extremely brutal murder of someone I knewto write about what we who knew him did and didn't do, comparing it to what Wolfe thought. Hmm. It would be just about as useful as this book. Notice how annoying it is when I add mine own little non-story. Geez.	2002-12-11

It's a book for believers, specifically, Christians, which is fine if that's what you want. The author, Henrietta C. Mears, is clear on her own beliefs and what she and the reader should believe. She's a little more fond of !!!!! than I care for, and there's a kind of a see?-I told-you-so kind of tone to it. Have you ever seen those bumper stickers that say something like, God Said It/I believe it/That's It! ?<br />That's how this book reads. Now, having said that, here's the general direction of the book.<br />Mears analyzes every book of the Bible. Every single chapter of her book starts out with the word Understanding, then names that book, from Genesis to Revelation. She reels off details and assessments of each book, with the underlying assumption that the reader agrees with what the Rev. Billy Graham says in the foreword to this book: \\"The Word of God is the only real authority we have.\\"<br />So, for example, in her chapter on Genesis, she writes: Satan appears to have special enmity for the book of Genesis. No wonder the Adversary has bent his attacks upon it. It exposes him as the enemy of God and the deceiver of the human race; it foretells his destruction; it depicts his doom.\\" A few pages later, we get this sentence Remember, Jesus Christ is the center of the Bible.<br />She also gives us such tidbits of information as this: there are 31,102 verses in the Bible, using 775,693 words*; Psalm 119 is the longest chapter; Psalm 117 the shortest. Ezra 7:21 contains all the letters of the alphabet except J (I don't know how well this fact stands up in translated versions and a conspiracy theorist could have a field day with the source J!); the longest book in the Old Testament is Psalms, the longest in the New Testament is Luke.<br />This book is probably best used in an adult Christian education class or something similar. I don't see it helping much on an ecumenical or evangelical level. Perhaps it works as a self-education tool, for someone who's arrived at Christian belief and wants a wider understanding of the sense of the full Bible.<br />*In English, I assume.book in the Old Testament is Psalms, the longest in the New Testament is Luke. <br />This book is probably best used in an adult Christian education class or something similar.

Given the increasing interest in recent years in the non-canonical works, Greek and other manuscripts that are not easily found in the local library are cited as a way of further illuminating the path toward further understanding of early Christian writing and thinking.<br />This is not a book that offers a lot of commentary. In fact, it offers virtually none. It simply lines up in a table such offerings as Accusations Against Jesus and then gives us Matthew (12:22-24) against Mark (3:19-22) and Luke (11:14-16).<br />One benefit of this style is that we're able to quickly see the differences in accounts. Those wanting an explication of the significance in choice of language or details included or excluded will have to look elsewhere for enlightenment. That makes this very thorough book a study aid accompanying other works that might provide more understanding; it is not a freestanding help to those curious about why accounts of Jesus' life or teaching vary so radically.<br />I used the fourth edition of this book in a New Testament course years ago and had forgotten its seeming limitations. But for those interested in serious exploration and in need of help tracking down New Testament and other texts, this book is invaluable.<br />It offers us a decent who's who of church fathers, and a short but terrific explanation of the different versions of texts in the Bible, which helps account for differing interpretations and changes in language. The fourth edition is in conformity with the Revised Standard Version of the Bible.<br />For those wondering, the Gospel of John is not included in this book because of the extensive differences in content between it and the three synoptic gospels covered by this book. Among them:<br />John doesn't include a lot of the material about the temptation of Christ, his transfiguration and the Lord's supper, the Sermon on the Mount. John offers virtually nothing in the way of narrative parables. John's account of Jesus' ministry is also at odds with the three synoptics.<br />The many differences make a side-by-side comparison just about impossible, though certainly extensive scholarship exists on this topic.<br />What this book will do is shed light on the ways in which some of the same events and thoughts are reported. You'll see quickly which author appears to exaggerate or at least report events in their most extreme, and which basic themes, such as concern for the downtrodden, draws the most attention in each gospel.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone studying the New Testament and in need of a quick guide to where to find a specific verse or theme.	2002-12-11

That it takes place in a country she never heard of before isn't relevant. <br />This is no fairy tale-it's the story of two Danish families, friends before the war, one Jewish and one Christian, who fight the effects of the German invasion of their country and the subsequent attempt to eliminate the Jewish population. <br />Through the pages of this book, we are given the story of the Rosens and the Johansens, who, on the eve of the Jewish New Year in 1943, wisely act to avert tragedy. The Rosens are blessed by the knowledge that the Nazis are beginning to move in and not paralyzed by fear into inaction. The Johansens are blessed by the knowledge that, as Danes, they could do nothing less but protect their friends and fellow Danes. <br />There are some scary moments, certainly, but not so frightening that children should avoid this book. Some books can be read without parents nearby; this one I recommend be read either by or with parents because some explanation of history is helpful. <br />One of the aspects of this book that I particularly liked was how it helps children to think and spot upcoming events.<br />At one point, for example, there's a reference to the Star of David necklace worn by one of the children. As the German soldiers barge into the Johansen home where the Jewish girl is hiding in plain sight, my daughter exclaimed that someone should hide the necklace before the soldiers find it. That's exactly what happens-the girls remove the necklace and the Germans are, temporarily, fooled into leaving them alone. <br />Luckily, the Johansens know that they've been granted a only a temporary reprieve, and so the rest of the storytells of Ellen Rosen's escape, along with most of the rest of Denmark's Jews, to Sweden and safety. <br />There are just enough ordinary details--the annoying younger sister, life in the shadow of a past tragedy--to leaven the story about the Nazis. <br />While the characters are fictional, the story, of course, is not, and so it is a great way for children to feel, rather than just hear, about the lives of people who fall victim to brutality and what individuals can do to combat evil. <br />I can't think of a better lesson for children to learn. Or grownups.	2002-12-11

I highly recommend it.<br /> O'Conner's books (Woe Is I, Words Fail Me, and now, You Send Me) remind me of an editor I work with who is a pun a minute. She can't stop herself and every conversation with her takes such twists and turns that the less articulate are left several sentences behind. If I didn't know that editor, I'd think that O'Conner and Kellerman had to have spent hours creating her more painful plays on words for some of their chapter and section titles: <BR>Grammar a la Modem<BR>Lurk Before You Leap<BR>Go Configure<BR>Clone Rangers<BR>Myth Information<BR>A Click and a Promise<BR>Help for the Whomless<br /> And on and on and on. I suspect it just spills out of them, fed by their obvious exuberance for their work. <br /> But all of these little plays are wrapped around very helpful bits of logical suggestions and advice delivered in a conversational style. While ostensibly meant to deal with the horrific onslaught of wretched writing that shows up in <BR>our e-mail, much of the book's advice can be applied to other writing. The team also reminds us of the need for accuracy in numbers and other facts, pointing out the difficulties so many people have with noticing what should be obvious exaggerations or faulty understanding of numbers.<br /> O'Conner and her husband-coauthor divide this book into three sections:<br /> The Virtual Mensch, which examines protocol issues--when to use e-mail, the need for subject lines, choice of e-mail names, keeping the reader in mind and more.<br /> Alpha Mail, which focuses more closely on better writing (with such advice as divide long sentences into shorter ones, break the message into paragraphs); eliminating cliches, which includes a list of cliches followed by an authors' comment, e.g., acid test (Give it an F), diamond in the rough (cubic zirconium), <BR>draw a blank (so fill it in), easier said than done (Then say it); the need for the writer to re-read an e-mail before sending it, and other topics.<BR> Words of Passage, which takes the authors right back to their real issue, <BR>language. Among other topics, they take us through easy lessons on it/its/it's/ <BR>and who/whom, subject-verb agreement and punctuation.<BR> <BR> This book is a handy addition to the bookshelf of any editor or writer interested in how the language is or should be used.	2002-08-12

But if you want to know the planetary exploration history and latest information about the search for planets beyond our solar  system, then pick up &quot;Looking for Earths.&quot; <br />  Alan Boss, a NASA adviser at the Carnegie Institution, has presented us with an extremely well written, smart and well-informed account of the search for &quot;extrasolar planets&quot;, those beyond our solar systems. Just in case  anyone thinks that's an easy step-you know, just pull up the telescope and point it at the stars, here is his description of the difficulty:  <br />  &quot;Trying to see an extrasolar planet right next to its star is  akin to trying to see a tiny mirror being held by a person standing next to a powerful carbon-arc searchlight that is  pointed right at you-you can't see the light from the mirror because you are blinded by the far brighter light from the<BR>searchlight itself. Human beings could start at the sky until<BR>their eyes popped without ever seeing a planet belonging to another star.&quot; <br />  What Boss does is quickly but clearly tell us the history of planetary exploration, tracing thoughts and discoveries,<BR>starting with Pythagoras in the sixth century B.C.E., who thought the Earth was fixed an unmoving, then explaining the brilliance of Copernicus and then Kepler, Brahe, Giordano Bruno, Kant and other early giants. <br />   Then he moves on to such contemporary heroes as Peter van de Kamp, Daniel Goldin and George Gatewood as they come up, rapid-fire, it seems, relatively speaking, with proof of the extrasolar planets' existence, some coming so quickly that scientists joked about subscribing to &quot;Planet of the Week&quot;. <br />  What Boss does especially well, besides writing in utterly understandable language, is connect the dots, as it were.<BR> <BR>   If you read this book, you'll get a wonderful look at scientific thinking and development, instead of getting science piecemeal. <br />   Boss has a rather interesting approach: starting with<BR> Chapter 3, he dates events as he opens the chapter, so that each chapter, and often sub-chapters start with the date of the discovery or event that led to a discovery. It's a neat way of encompassing history and allows us to see how quickly ideas can move along. Most obvious to me was the sense that discoveries are speeding up-each development happens a little more quickly and closely to its predecessor, feeding yet the next discovery. <br />   The science outlined in this book is totally comprehensible to most teenagers and adults and probably some pre-teens as well, if they're reasonably aware of astronomical issues. You may want to skip some of the deeper science and just read about the discoveries and who made them. Charts and photos accompany<BR>several chapters to help explain who did what and why it was important. <br />   Anyone wanting to know more about what's next, and not have to get all their science from Star Trek would be well advised to read this book.	2002-06-29

That's not necessarily a bad thing, even for<BR>those who think we're too busy buying and selling<BR>already. <br />I read this from a consumer's perspective and found it educational. Not once, after I opened the pages, was I tempted to sneer at the point of the book--teaching people how to sell. Why? Because the book strikes me as honest. <br />Yes, it's teaching kids and others to persuade someone else to do something, perhaps something they don't want. But at no time is there a hint of deception or arm twisting. It's simply a guide to knowing your market. <br />That's something anyone who works with potential customers in any<BR>venue--and that's a lot of us, folks--needs to understand. <br />This book will teach you some terminology--early adopters vs. laggards, account planning, laddering and more--that is creeping into ordinary vocabulary, has applications well beyond plain old advertising and therefore must be understood. For those of us who live in this intensely consumer society, I recommend this book because it's really, after all, about us. <br />The book is written in a comfortably breezy manner, easily read by high school students and up, by Lisa Fortini-Campbell, a top-ranking woman in the advertising/marketing field. She offers us both theory and practical help, in sections ranging from defining the reason for understanding consumers to working with others to achieve goals.	2002-06-06

The \\"middle column\\" of the Wall Street Journal is where you'll find all kinds of quirky, off-beat pieces on people or issues you thought you might not care about. But the writing draws you in and makes you care about the eccentric Englishman who's built a medieval siege engine, or the doomsday group, or the guy who tests aircraft viability by hurling dead chickens through the air, or the Laotian navy, and the more than 60 other characters presented in this book. While the quirkiness of finding these stories surrounded by the much more serious reporting of financial stories might catch your eye, the content of the material will hold it.<BR> This is a great book for people looking for another view of the world and what's important. And journalists take note: there's a goldmine of story possibilities in this book.	2002-04-24

Rather, it is a wonderfully literate account of the author's experiences and insights about a region as the Soviet Union loses its grip and the people wonder what is next.<BR>   More of the same hatred that brought us Sept.11? Or an opportunity for good diplomacy and honest dealings? <BR>    We don't know right now, but Thubron gives us a chance to taste life as people there are living it and as we may be see it, willingly or not, in the near future.<BR>  This book is a gem. Anyone interested in what may happen next in the encounters between Islamic cultures and the West should read this book.	2002-04-06

It tells us about how everyone, it seems, was affected on that day, and it tells us how one photojournalist, one of several Magnum photo agency photographers, was personally touched by the events. He and others, who had come from postings around the world to New York City for a meeting the day before, captured the images of the story of their professional lives. And, of course, it's about the dreadful smoke, the utter devastation as the Twin Towers first burned then collapsed in full view of millions.<br />The Magnum book is an excellent record of the disaster. Even those who have seen hundreds of photos and TV accounts will find pictures that are worthy of extra study. As a record, it's excellent, though I have yet to find a book that has captured the entire story. It's probably too soon. But the starkness of many of the pictures, the shades of gray and blue as the concrete dust and soot spewed for blocks (and later miles) and then settled on everything an everyone, should be seen in still photo. It's very different from the moving images on TV and demand careful attention.<BR> <BR>   The photos tell us that people sometimes do strange things, though they may be explicable. There's probably a reason that a woman sat on a rooftop in Brooklyn, with her baby, and watched the disaster, even though the choking smoke must have drifted over her pretty quickly. Perhaps she couldn't look away. <br />  The red, white and blue of an American flag adds just a touch of color to the otherwise smoky blue-gray centerpiece picture by Thomas Hoepker. It's a chilling picture, one capable of telling anyone who wasn't there what it really looked like, almost what it felt like. <br />  This book is absolutely a keeper for the future. Many are not the news pictures we've become familiar with because of the endless reruns on TV but that's what gives them extra value. As time passes, and memories fade, this book will remind us what it was like that awful day.	2002-01-17

Martin, because it is uneven, moving from the obvious (the word girl, for example), offering up tidbits of definitions of rather well-known words (the Amish) and the obscure (offshore buying units.) It is a book of multiple purposes or no clear purpose at all to the public.<br />  Internal stylebooks sometimes suffer from a fuzziness growing out of dual purposes, meant to fix the same errors that crop up regularly, to define the words most troublesome for that publication, to provide consistency in usage and presentation.  Sometimes they are little more than a compilation of the memos issued by a copy desk or news editor, reminding people about the correct names of companies or the policies on datelines, or to remind editors on acceptable headline practices. <br /> Other times, stylebooks grow out of a sense of mission to guard the language from silliness and doublespeak while allowing the language to grow, as English does. <br />   What I didn't find in this book was the Journal's obvious ability to teach, as demonstrated in some other WSJ guides. While a stylebook doesn't have to take education as a mission, once it goes public, the educational component would seem to be essential. <br />    Why else would anyone not worried about whether to capitalize executive director buy this book?  As an internal publication, the stylebook is useful. It sets standards and clearly tackles problem words, I'm sure fed by repeated misuses of certain words or facts by its own staff.  I'd be willing to bet that the items on defuse/diffuse, or bizarre/bazaar, for example, are  included because someone(s) on the staff has demonstrated confusion on their proper usage. <BR>  <BR>This is no knock on the obvious effort that went into putting this book together. Virtually every editor I know flees in terror at the prospect of having to produce a stylebook for the company.  But once it went public, it needed some more thought. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes to collect style and language manuals, or people who need more sources of information on certain business terms. But I wouldn't rush out to buy this as a first choice on either language or business.	2002-01-02

That one of the co-authors is the key player in the most recent developments about the fire shouldn't have allowed the authors to occasionally lean on purple writing.  Cheers for the investigator blend with boos the lapses in the writing.<br />   The fire was tragic on its own, the actions of the investigator commendable on their own, without  the overwriting that describes investigator Rick Davey's long quest to solve a mystery that he'd grown up hearing about and later felt compelled to solve.  <BR>   <BR>   That the pieces were all there, waiting to be assembled, is no knock on his desire to find them all, put them together and reach a conclusion that finally was accepted by those remaining.  <br />   That many knew, or should have known, key details that could have led to an arrest, the identification of the mystery victim, a more equitable punishment of those responsible for the disaster and so on, should be a lesson to us all today. As the country tries to assess  events related to Sept.11, questions of building security and design, fair distribution of compensation, U.S. intelligence and much more, I'd like to hope we've learned the lessons of the dangers of secrecy and failure of many to take responsibility for their actions. We shall see.<br />   This account may leave you wishing for yet one more book on this topic before the fire's survivors  fade away. Most of the key official players are long gone from the scene but there's still more to be said about the fire that claimed 168 lives.<br />  In contrast with one other book on the same topic, this book is writtenmore clearly and from an investigator's viewpoint.  Thus it has less detail about the hellish experiences of the victims and more focus on attempting to explain the fire's origins, possible perpetrator and the identity of one mysterious victim. <BR> <BR>  As briefly as possible, and eliminating the utterly unnecessary melodrama about the life of the fire investigator who co-authored this book, here are the main details about the disaster:<br />  Several thousand people attended the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in Hartford, Conn., on July 6, 1944, a fire broke out on the Big Top's canvas, patrons trying to flee were trapped and either burned or crushed to death.  Most of the victims were quickly identified, with a handful of exceptions, one of them a little girl who came to be known as Little Miss 1565.  Nearly as speedily, several circus employees were sentenced to relatively short jail terms for having failed to meet certain safety regulations.<br /> Anyone who lived in Hartford in the 1950s through the 1970s will remember the investigators who, each year, placed flowers on the mystery girl's grave, and the annual recounting of the disaster.  They'd also remember the emotional resistance when, in the 1970s, a circus proposed returning to Hartford for a Big Top  show. The feelings of Hartford residents ran deep, very deep, even 30 years later. What didn't run as deep, apparently, was a desire to find out just what had caused the fire, or the resolve to identify the mystery girl.  Sometimes people just don't want to know. That no one had written a book about this tragedy until just the last few years is stunning to an outsider. <br />    While on a private quest to answer the long-standing question about the identity of 1565, Davey began digging through State Library records and, to his credit, uncovered a trail that led directly to a hired hand working for the circus. The suspect had a long history of arson, and had confessed, a few years after thedisaster, to setting the Hartford fire. The tale of why Connecticut authorities failed to take the man's confession seriously-or rather, to move against him-is justifiably a big part of this book.  Someone appears to have let someone else get away with murder but unfortunately, despite Davey's best efforts, the reason is unresolved beyond the belief that it was nothing but a coverup, meant to explain the initial erroneuous findings. Also valuably reported by Davey is the extent of statewide personal and political contacts that sent the circus men to jail while keeping city politicians out of harm's way or even having to answer questions about how the disaster occurred. And, no surprise, Davey was left hanging out in the wind once his findings came to light. <BR>   His recounting of the family of the mysterious girl and how each coped with the tragedy of dual losses that day are heartbreaking.<br />   Unfortunately, many of the officials who might have been forced to answer for their failure to act, and apparent decision to quickly close the case, are long dead. Equally incomprehensible is the failure of contemporary authorities to act on Davey's findings, because they are definitely convincing, even to one who initially doubted the mystery had been solved 50 years after the fire.<br />  Particularly valuable is Davey's obvious hard work at uncovering the records of earlier investigations that could have led to an arrest. In fact, one of the surprises of this book is that some of this information was known years ago.  But a)he's the only one who appears to have done this legwork b)he's done a good job telling us how he did it, which invites the question as to why no one else ever has.<br />So, read this book, but skip the prologue, which borders on the ludicrous because of the writing, as important as it might be to Davey, and Chapter 16, which is an account of Davey's childhood, and totally unnecessary to the telling of this story. Though he is the key player in thereopening of this case, he doesn't belong in the story this way. Where were the editors?	2001-12-31

But overall, the book holds up quite well because it takes a look at the historical issues feeding Islamic matters today.<br /> Given Pakistan's importance to U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, I found the chapter on that country especially worth re-reading.<br />  Here are a couple of things Mortimer says: &quot;Pakistan was an attempt to re-create an Islamic order after a long period of colonial rule...Pakistan was therefore an experiment of great significance for Muslims wherever the incursion of the West had broken the continuity of their political tradition.&quot;<br />  Mortimer goes on to raise questions about the viability and even logic of the existence of Pakistan, given its lack of ethnic and religious identification that would distinguish it from other states in the area or around the Muslim world.<br />  Pakistan forms just one chapter of Mortimer's excellent book, which starts with the beginnings of the Muslim faith and goes through the historical divisions within Islam, Western impact on the Arab and Muslim world, Arab nationalism, the rise of the Shiite clerics to power in Iran and the Soviet disaster in Afghanistan.<br /><br />  This is a book requiring serious attention because what Mortimer has to say applies to current events regardless of  when it was published.	2001-10-04

Equally important, he tells us how he survived his hellacious odyssey through Nazi death camps, his techniques for survival and the pure luck that kept him from destruction.<BR>  I found the writing a little choppy and some of the material was a bit repetitious.  The book sometimes read more like an interview with someone eager to spill out the details before it's too late. So what?

This is not a fatal mistake; I've just found myself a little confused by the lives of some of Bethany's friends as they leave one career--say, operating a massage parlor, for another, running a religious theme park. That's also not the fault of the author or his sharp writing. Doolittle is a must read for anyone appalled by what passes for political and moral leadership in this day and age. Be prepared for some of Doolittle's zingers, hurled at many people in all of his Bethany books, but thrown with a little extra sting at phony moralizing. Suffice it to say that, in this book, Bethany puts away the bad guy in fine fashion, though not until after he's done irreparable harm to a teenager he doesn't even know. I recommend Doolittle without qualms; someone has to take on the phonies of the world and not be real nice about it in the process.	2001-09-04

Non-canonical refers to texts not accepted as part of the New Testament, for a variety of reasons. They aren't necessarily subversive, though some paint rather conflicting views of Jesus and his teachings. But mostly what they provide is simply more material, much of it subject to further interpretation. Some of the material is known as Gnostic material; some is not.   Author Ron Cameron has broken the 16 non-canonical works into two broad categories: Traditions of the Sayings of Jesus and Traditions of Stories About Jesus.  He gives us extended quotations of such material as the Gospel of Thomas or the Secret Gospel of Mark.  In all cases, Cameron then uses the material to shed further light on how Christian thinking about Jesus and his teachings developed beyond the material admitted to the canon.   This book assumes a certain knowledge, though not extensive, of early Christian writings. It's a worthy companion to other readings about the Gospels. Particularly worth noting is Cameron's assessment that the cited material, rather than developing out of established canonical works, may well have predated the material we're most familiar with. If the assessment of Cameron and other scholars is correct, the writings are especially worth reading because they could alter our views of the teachings of Jesus.	2001-08-19

Roman Vishniac, secretly, in some cases, shot thousands of pictures of the Jewish population of Eastern Europe, shortly before they were swallowed up by the Holocaust. <br />  Young, old, in-between are shown going about their ordinary lives, some already paying the price of the prevalent Eastern European anti-Semitism, virtually oblivious to what was coming their way.<br />  You can't look at these pictures and not shudder: certainly no one in these pictures can still be alive, and it's not just because of the passage of time. Most of the people photographed here lived in the smaller villages, segregated in many cases from the Gentiles, wearing clothes that quickly and easily identified them to their destroyers. <br /> Vishniac shot an estimated 16,000 pictures, but managed to get only about 2,000 out when he fled to the United States in 1940.

Further, it's wise to read it now, because an awful lot of the people instrumental in the ultimate decision, Brown vs. the Board of Education, are dying out. The late Thurgood Marshall is a great example of a lost legal talent and courageous leader who did the right thing by all Americans by winning this case.  Read this book now, if only so you'll recognize the heroes in their obituaries.<br />  What Richard Kluger has done in this account is spell out the development first of segregation, telling us just who and how the dreaded Jim Crow laws came about-including segregation laws in the North-and then walk us through how, piece by piece, legal decisions were strung together to put an end to legal segregation. <br />  I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and, if I thought about it at all,  had the idea that the Brown decision had more or less come out of nowhere. Eventually, I began to catch on, and then I read this book. If you are similar-minded, this book will set you straight and point you to the many unsung heroes who have made us a fairer country, in line with the ideals that helped found this country.  If you're a parent looking for good role models, forget sports and entertainment. Look to this book for examples of people who literally risked everything, and often paid dearly, to do the right thing. They didn't shrink from the challenge; they stepped forward, many many times. That so many others did not only reminds us of how fearful we are to force change or risk our own well being to tackle injustice.    I wish I could rate it higher.	2001-08-04

I just don't know if he's right, but it doesn't really matter.<br />  What Rifkin tells us is that there is a war developing or even already going on, between the advocates of speed and efficiency--almost speed for the sake of speed--and those who prefer, as he puts it, a &quot;more empathetic union with the rhythm of nature.&quot; In that latter category he puts many members of the environmental , holistic health, biological agriculture, animal-rights, economic democracy and  other movements, who may just think that they're a little bit lefty, not engaged in a struggle for our souls.<br /> Rifkin outlines a history of time, as it were, or more specifically, a history of how people have viewed time. He analyzes different cultures' views of time, which are considerably different, the sense that humans can have power over time, which has not been the belief of all cultures in the past, and the rise to domination of Western views of time (along with pretty much everything else, at least right now).<br />  If you are white and ever been immersed in black or other minority culture, you may hear references to &quot;CP time&quot; or &quot;Indian time&quot;. This has often said as a joke but refers to the very different sense of the importance of time and punctuality. It's a smart observation, really, that points out that not everyone is driven by the need to meet a deadline, arrive precisely when expected, operate in a way that those of us in the West feel is the right way. And it's at the heart of what Rifkin is saying about our attempts to capture and define time.<br /> Though the book is written in a very clear style, this is not a book to be read while watching TV or while otherwise distracted. There are Big Thoughts here about who we are as a society and how humans will view their responsibilities, the concept of progress, the Information Age and more, now and in the future.uture.	2001-07-26

In fact, given the expanse of ideas and peoples covered in such a history,  a reader may find the book a bit overwhelming-the long list of names and various dynasties, changing political fortunes and borders can be wearing. This book might best be read in small doses. That said, it does a very credible job of telling us what we, especially in the West, ought to know more about.	2001-07-25

I've tried very hard to figure out why people think this insulting and simplistic book is valuable. I've gone back to read previous chapters that I could barely stand the first time, and still I don't see it. What I read instead if ridiculous nonsense written as if we were all children about why we should be happy that corporations are upending the workplace. That, actually, is an entirely separate issue that can't be dealt with here because the presentation is so stupid that it interferes with what otherwise is an important topic: recognizing and accepting change. In a healthy way. Not as if we were a bunch of mice too dumb to do anything but run down the passage to an unknown fate.   There has to be better stuff out there. Please?	2001-07-22

Further, there are distinct differences in tone and approach between the New and Old Testaments and among the books that make up each of the two main divisions.<br />   Buckner B. Trawick assesses all 27 books of the New Testament, telling us in his analysis who the likely authors and sources are for the material, and placing each book in its proper historical and geographical contexts. This is no mean feat. The context goes a long way toward erasing the problems people sometimes have with the contemporary interpretation of language and social matters.       While it helps to be already somewhat familiar with the New Testament, it is not essential. Trawick helps readers understand the content of the New Testament by analyzing books, and comparing and contrasting the accounts, in such overall themes as the Parables, Miracles, the Discipleship of Women and several other key topics.<br /> This is a highly readable work that anyone interested in one of the major faiths should own.	2001-07-22

He provides us many heroes and villains, the latter category dominated by the Doge of Venice, who shifted the direction and goal of the Crusade for personal reasons,  with disastrous national, religious and geopolitical results.<br /> The  Fourth Crusade got its push from a series of French efforts to emulate the First Crusade, which meant recapturing the Holy Land for Christians and driving the Muslims from the land. Because the center of Islamic power at this point (1199-1204) was in Egypt, the supports of the Fourth Crusade decided that that land was the logical starting point.       How the Crusade got re-routed and redirected toward the destruction of another Christian city, how its citizens were massacred by their fellow co-religionists and how the impact of this disaster is felt to this day is the story of Bradford's book.    His writings are heavily sourced, with first-person citations throughout, which lends extra credibility. Bradford's scholarship is first rate and anyone reading his work is likely to learn something he didn't know before.<br />  I would not consider this a light read, but I found it more understandable in the context of some information about the Crusades that surrounded it. <br />   The history of the Fourth Crusade is loaded with the \\"If only\\" moments mentioned at the beginning: If only the Doge of Venice hadn't been blinded in an accident in Constantinople; if only the Pope had been stronger; if only some of the leaders of the expedition had been personally stronger and able to resist the machinationsof the Venetians, ourown history might be different. But here's one of those simple \\"what if\\" moments that changed history.<br />  Constantinople was  somewhat protected, theoretically, by the  Galata tower, from which a large chain stretched 1,500 feet across the Golden Horn to the sea, meant to deny ships access to the northern water route and the harbor of Constantinople. First, the leaders of Constantinople allowed what was clearly an invading army to land next to the tower, neglecting to reinforce the tower and prevent its capture. Soldiers from within the city and a handful from the tower made a half-hearted attempt to attack the Crusaders only after they  had landed and fully deployed. As the Crusaders fought back, some of the tower defenders failed to shut the gate of the tower behind them, allowing the Crusaders to enter  the building and to lower the great chain that had kept them from sailing into the harbor.  So it was with very little military effort at that point, the Crusaders had gained the upper hand.    I would recommend this to anyone who has at least a small grasp on the Crusader time period but wants to know more.	2001-07-15

And someone I'm extremely eager to keep reading.  <br />   Through his Tom Bethany character, a private investigator with no clear clientele, but an intense focus on righting wrongs,  Doolittle lets readers know immediately-NO, NOW!-what's wrong with bureaucrats, lots of businessmen, some cops, lawyers and many others whose very existence makes others suffer. And, oh, yeah. Lots of Republicans.<br />  Now, to be fair, he also tackles dopey Democrats and their occasional, in Doolittle's view, misdeeds. Jimmy Carter comes in for a regular swipe for having refused to allow the United States to participate in the 1980 Olympics because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. (Even as I write this, that move does seem to be rather dumb, and I like Jimmy Carter).  But the Republicans really take a pounding, regularly and incisively, almost to the point of wincing, which I maybe, just might do if I could stop laughing and nodding in agreement. Not just any Republicans, mostly just the indicted ones.<br />  While Doolittle is making clear his views, he works them very cleverly, though not stealthily, into the storyline of each of his books.<br />   And, now, the storyline for Strangle Hold. <br />      Tom Bethany is a low-key, somewhat paranoid but very human private investigator in Cambridge, Mass. <br />   Bethany takes on a job investigating the death of Morty Limbach, who appears to have committed suicide. Limbach was the son of extremely rich parents, who think he was a total failure for having gone left in his politics. His main work in life was funding a group of troupe of actors, whose flaws as individuals is on display throughout the story. <br />  Limbach may have been engaged in auto-erotica when he died, which helps feed the urge to cover up how he died.  An insurance policy payoff worth a quarter of amillion dollars rides on the determination of how he died.<br />    Needless to say, Bethany figures out the  case--it's murder--and who did it and why.  Using a minimum of violence, though more is implied, he confronts and captures the bad guy. <br />  The story moves along nicely, building in little subplots, painting character portraits and mixing in a nice blend of people, from the wife of a retired bishop, to a female med student with a string of boyfriends to a cop with a strong sense of duty to a girlfriend married to a late-blooming gay man.  All are characters rather different from the usual folks found in crime stories.      Bethany doesn't live in an aha-gotcha! world. He lives by his wits.    It's Doolittle's writing and depiction of people that sell the story, because, after all, how interesting is one poor little rich guy whose parents didn't love him? We're sympathetic but heck, missing interns and dallying congressmen provide more exciting possibilities.  His insight into people, their character flaws and their motivation, and his running social commentary, make the reading far too good to pass up.<br /> If you're a Republican, you can still read this book, because after all, foibles are foibles, and you can shift them over in your brain to any number of Democrats if you'd prefer. I just happen to find them extra hilarious because his comments happen to target real people.	2001-07-14

Because there are far more Arab and Turkic peoples in the region, the book focuses far more on them than on the Jewish communities or on Israel. But the latter country is not overlooked, and there are a fair number of references and explanations of Jewish issues.       The authors take an anthropological, rather than a political science, view of the region, which makes for easier reading, and keeps the reader from having to wonder about the hidden meaning of each statement. <br />  They look at the early history, with migration a big factor, the arrival and growth of Islam, first as a religion and then, quickly, as a political force, farming practices, the growth of cities, familial ans social issues and development of contemporary political states.<br /> This book is well worth the time of people who wonder about the many ethnic groups in the Mideast, especially those who think there are just two sides and two kinds of people there contending for the same ground. They don't spend a lot of time laying arguments out for who should control what part of Jerusalem; they're too busy talking about things in a longer range historical context.<br />  Though written for the academic world, it is an easy read, offering us a thorough perspective into a vital part of the world.	2001-06-08

The entire story has a ring of truth, populated by far too many less than scrupulous people trying to scrape by in life.  Author Jerome Doolittle delivers a great deal of amusing comment on politics and contemporary culture, though you may like it a bit more if you're a Democrat than a  Republican. Everyone, though, who has suffered through watching the wrong people advance in the corporate culture should appreciate this sentence, offered in a side riff about office politics and the military: &quot;You can learn a lot about what's wrong with the world by watching how the scum beats the cream to the top.&quot;<br />     Doolittle brings a fascinating series of careers that feed the colorful detailsof his novels: speechwriter for Jimmy Carter, war correspondent, café owner in Laos. Kill story is the sixth in the Tom Bethany series. Read him for whatever reasons, but read him for a wonderfully good time and yet another twist on the standard private investigator story.	2001-05-28

That many of the victims were children lent an extra touch of poignancy, but there is no shortage of sad stories, with heroes,  victims and villains throughout.    <br />  In addition to setting the scene of local politics and the  atmosphere of wartime Hartford, O'Nan gives us page after page of horrific accounts of what happened under the Big Top, who saw the fire when it first broke out, what they did,  and, above all, the gruesome stories of those who survived the panicked rush to escape, and those who did not. What O'Nan has managed to do, above all, is record history before its participants fade away.  <br />    That the cause of the fire has never been determined adds an extra sense of sadness to the whole event. What is known is that the tent, like many circus tents at the time, was covered with a mix of paraffin and gasoline to keep the raindrops out. When the flames broke out, the people were trapped as if they were in a huge candle, doomed if they couldn't flee fast enough.  Some survived through sheer luck, having arrived late, or having a penknife in their pockets to cut a hole in the tent. That the crowd's exit was blocked by the placement of cages for the animals' act, and that the tent's sides were pinned down firmly so that kids couldn't sneak into the show for free guaranteed the deaths of many.             You may think you're used to horror scenes because of the violence and gore of movies, but here's one paragraph that may tell you a little about what it was like to be trapped inthis tent: \\"Several survivors said the one thing they'll never forget about the circus fire as long as they live is the sound of the animals as they burned alive. But there were no animals.\\"<br />     But here's the most important lesson I got from this book: never hesitate. Those that survived often did so because they reacted quickly-as soon as they saw the fire, they started heading for the exit. Those who hesitated for more than a few moments, who thought the flames were part of the act, that someone else would take care of it, or were simply shocked at what might happen, for the most part died in the crush. Don't wait.	2001-05-27
