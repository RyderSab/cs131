This book is a series of walking tours around Rome with your guide being the words and letters of two thousand years of visitors.  Where else will you find a guide book, for example, recording the impressions of Dante, Henry James and Florence Nightingale of the same buildings?  I took this book with me to Rome and carried it with me every day alongside the Fodor's guide.  Most travel books tell you where to find the monuments, the churches and the museums - this guide book tells you about the romance of the Eternal City.  It is a guide book with a true heart - I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2004-06-19

I thought it would be an easy read (it is about 600 pages or so long) and, as I said above, the plot interested me; what would the world have been liked if Caucasian Europe had been wiped out in the Plague?<br />The author constructs an alternative universe where China and Islam fight for global supremacy with Hindu India and the North American Indians showing the world how to exist more peacefully. The book was very instructive about world religions, particularly Islam and Buddhism. There are two main characters in the book, \\"Ka\\" and \\"Ba\\" who are continually reincarnated over a period of 800 years as they try to reach nirvana. Using this technique, the author demonstrates how the world might have evolved.<br />At times the narrative seemed to meander and there is a lot more theology in there than I had anticipated. I have to say that Islam emerges from the novel with a bad report card; he seems to view the practice of this religion (but not the tenets of the Koran itself) as violent and misognist; in the book, Islam is doomed to failure for this reason. Ultimately it is the Asian cultures which gain supremacy.<br />A provocative book for sure - it was not the brain relaxant that I was looking for but equally, it got me pondering. I finished the book about a week ago and I am still thinking about it - not many books get that sort of reaction out of me.	2003-02-26

I bought this book after having tried Fantasy Lover which was much more funny and entertaining than this novel.  All the ingredients of a popular, modern romance novel are there (see all the glowing reviews just on Amazon.com).  Yet I found the plot meandered around a lot and I skim read several sections to get on with the real action.  I had the sense while reading the book that Kenyon is laying the ground work for the future Dark Hunters series at the expense of this particular story.  But, this was a good trashy read, and I always like to read books where the author has a sense of humour!	2002-12-16

The plot is great; David Beck is attacked and left for dead when his wife is kidnapped and brutally murdered.  Eight years later, he receives a mysterious email which suggests that his wife may not have died after all... what a great hook for a reader!  The novel, however, is rambling and by the end, I was desperate to finish and skim-read the book not because I cared about the characters, but so that I could find out whether Elizabeth Beck was, in fact, dead or not.  The characterisation was pretty average too.  In summary, a good story but not a book that is going to keep you gripped on the edge of your seat.	2002-10-29

It is, however, very absorbing.  It is the story of the Norse in Greenland and the hard lives that they lived in a very unforgiving land.  It is an interesting insight into medieval times.  It does not read like an easy historical novel, you have to work it at, and sometimes your attention strays.  But then something dramatic occurs and the reader is sucked back in again.  Since finishing the novel, I have been scouring the internet to find out more about the end of the Norse settlements in Greenland.

The characters are extremely two-dimensional and the dialogue is weak.  The author is not a good writer.  What he does have, however, is a great imagination.  I liked the story of this book and thought the hook (ie.

I found the characters very distant and I could not get involved in their stories.  On the other hand, this book is beautifully written and the depiction of ancient battles, and the way the author relates them to the modern day story of Captain Carlo, is very good indeed.  The scene at the beginning of the book as Carlo relates a battle tale to Count Ciano (Mussolini's foreign minister) and to his future wife is truly ace.  This is a book for an intelligent reader and I am sure there are many Amazon readers who consider themselves to be that!	2002-06-14

However, this one really disappointed me.  I am surprised because I think it was this book that was picked for Oprah's Book Club.  I have to say that in my view, this is one of the weaker novels by Shreve that I have read.  Books like Fortune's Rocks, The Weight of Water and, my personal favourite, The Last Time They Met, are far superior in style and content.<br />That said, Shreve is head and shoulders above most writers and I still enjoyed this book immensely.  This is a story about a widow who discovers her husband's secret life after he dies at the helm of the plane he was flying, killing nearly 200 passengers along with him.  Although the plot is not hard to predict, it is nevertheless a very engrossing story.  Those readers who have not yet discovered the marvellous Anita Shreve will be sucked in!	2002-05-21

But, for the first time, I felt that the story was running out of steam.  The novel introduces the time travel thing again, this time it is Roger and Brianna who make the leap into the Eighteenth Century to hunt for Jamie and Claire.  This is where the book was a real cliffhanger as the reader cannot wait to read the reunion between Jamie and Brianna.  <br />It then stumbles for the last third waiting for its resolution.  I will not say why since anyone who has not read the book would kill me!  I think it is right that the focus has now moved on to Brianna and Roger but their love story has not been as well fleshed out as that of Jamie and Claire.

What a wonderful, extraordinary novel this is.  This is by far his best work.  It leaves similar \\"Australian themed works\\" written by Thomas Kenneally in the dust.<br />I cannot remember a time in my life when I did not know about Ned Kelly and the pictures of him with his gun, protected by his iron armour, are an instrinsic part of Australian culture.  He represents so many aspects of nineteenth century life for us - he was a child of convicts, he was a bushranger, he worked the land - and he refused to suffer in silence the injustices heaped upon him (and so many of his ilk) by the English squatterocracy.  At the same time, he was a murderer and a robber...<br />Reading this novel is truly like being inside Ned Kelly's head.  It is so vibrant and so real.  I did not find the vernacular style of writing difficult at all - it is like Ned is speaking directly to you.  It is incredibly eloquent in a weird way!  Carey writes so evocatively, too - you can smell the bush, the sounds of a gunshot, the feel of a silk dress.  It is at time very poignant.  We get a real sense of the man - he felt things very deeply, he loved well, and he was intensely loyal.<br />My favourite part of the book was the final showdown at Glenrowan and the speech from Henry V.  Incongrous?  Absolutely.  But does it work - oh my goodness, yes!!	2002-04-01

This book is thoroughly enjoyable entertainment.  What is wonderful is that many plotlines run through it, with love stories for all generations, ranging from 19 year old Sara to 60 year old Joyce.<br />The real thrust of the story is about Polly and Sloane, the former Montana cowboy turned George Cloony superstar.  Suspend your disbelief and wallow in wonderful story of how Sloan courts Polly and wins her over, ostensibly by agreeing to be a bid in a cowboy auction!  Cool or what.<br />Actually, the best story to my mind was that of Celie and Jace - I found myself skipping the Polly and Sloane parts to get back to those two.  Thankfully Ann McAllister is taking up the threads in her next book - she has left a great cliffhanger.<br />I really recommend this book - I am sure you will love it.	2002-04-01

It is the story of a small Alpine village over the course of 70 years told through the lives of the women who lived there.  Each chapter is the story of an individual woman at a point in time, but the stories weave in and out so that you never lose track of what happened to them.  I found the book deeply satisfying to read - at times it was funny, it was always touching and often very sad.  I felt I was involved in the lives of these women (and their men-folk), there was great suspense and it was extremely well-written.  <br />I wonder what other readers made of the final chapter - it seemed to me that everything had come full circle.

Naval fiction has never attracted me so it was with some trepidation that I eventually bit the bullet and decided to try this book.<br />I cannot pretend that this book was easy-going.  There is a lot of jargon used that, unless you are a sea boffin, frankly you will not understand.  But the funny thing is, you don't need to.  As other reviewers have pointed out, O'Brian has very skilfully evoked the world of 1800 in this novel and this book really did transport me to another era and place.  It is also frequently funny.  The characters of Aubrey and Maturin were attractive and engaging.  You certainly do not need to be a man or 96 years old to be able to enjoy this book!  <br />I am not sure if I will read any other novels in the series since I did find this book to be hard work at times.  But what I cannot deny is that the Aubrey/Maturin series undoubtedly gives a great deal of pleasure to many people - if it is for this reason alone, you owe it to yourself to give this book a try.	2002-03-14

Anita Shreve is simply a brilliant, brilliant writer.  The novel is structured in reverse chronological order so that when we first meet Thomas and Linda, in 1990s Toronto, we do not know how they met, why they split up and why they could never be together.  We know immediately that their love was profound, however.  Gradually, as the novel moves back through time, we discover their stories and the deep sadness of the missed opportunities and the what-ifs.  What I found interesting about this book is how the character of Linda matured over time - the grown woman is clearly very different to the 17 year old girl - yet Thomas's character seemed to stay essentially the same.  It is involving to the reader, to see the way in which each character reacted to what had happened to them.  Oh, I could talk about this book for hours!!!<br />The end of the novel is shocking and you will want to re-read passages from the book to try to pick up on the clues.  I adore Anita Shreve and the wonderful clarity and spareness of purpose in which she writes.  She conveys so much and she writes so skilfully.  Anita Shreve is a marvellous story-teller.  Her students at Amherst College are so lucky to have her as their creative writing professor - she is truly gifted.<br />A tip - you may want to read The Weight of Water first before trying this book - The Last Time we Met is a kind of sequel to the Weight of Water.	2002-02-24

It is notoriously hard to find any information about the people who were transported to Australia as convicts let alone details about female convicts.  Thanks to a little known memoir of one of the ship's officers, John Nicol, Sian Rees has been able to put a small amount flesh onto the bones of the women who were among the very first convicts to be sent to Australia.  We learn about the offences of some of the women, how they supported themselves as prostitutes at ports of call (or by sleeping with the ship's company) in order to survive and, in some cases, their extraordinary life stories (both failures and successes) once they arrived in Sydney Cove.

I heard an interview with Patricia Cornwell about this book and was intrigued - and I haven't been intrigued by a Scarpetta novel for some time. Patricia said that in this book she wanted to explore Kay's own reaction to grief, bearing in mind that until now Kay has always dealt with the grief of other people. I thought this was an interesting idea and thus bought the book. <br />My only complaint about this idea is that Scarpetta did not fall to pieces over the death of her beloved boyfriend Mark from an IRA bomb at Victoria station (one of the more sillier plotlines Cornwell has used, I might add) to the extent she has done so over Benton. But this is a minor quibble!<br />Like many readers I share some of the criticisms about the \\"james bondisation\\" of the main characters and Cornwell's obsessions with the sexuality of her characters. It would be good if Kay could stay in Richmond for one novel at least! Lucy is no longer a credible character but Cornwell (at least) alluded to this via some of the comments made by Marino in Black Notice about Lucy's latest somewhat deranged escapades. The Diane Bray storyline seemed a bit pointless - I mean, why would Diane Bray give a rat's *** about Kay Scarpetta? She is just a forensic examiner for crying out loud!! And Jay was poorly characterised. It would also be good if next time Cornwell could drop the killer chasing after Scarpetta storyline - that really is tired now and we all know Kay will survive! There is absolutely no suspense in that route at all and as other reviewers have said, it was all so predictable.<br />But for some reason I found Black Notice to be a compelling read and I enjoyed it much more than I have some of the more recent Cornwell fare. The murders were interesting and I did not spot the resolution of the baby hair. I think some of the reviewers have been a bit harsh on the technical aspects of this book which, as ever, were second to none. ANOTHER TIP - Patricia Cornwell said in the radio interviewthat she is developing an interest in archaeology and has been going on digs, looking at skeletons, etc. This reminded me of the Kathy Reichs novels where the main character is a forensic anthrolopolgist. Is this going to be a future Scarpetta storyline? Watch this space... <BR>(I previously reviewed this novel in September 1999)	2002-02-15

With eagerness I bought it!  The author's narrative method, however, is unusual.  It changes from third person to third person, plays around with chronology and, occasionally, speaks directly to the reader to form a view about a scene or a character.  Frankly, I did not like this approach - I wanted to read a story and instead my mind was being challenged from all directions.  This is not a criticism - as you can see from the customer reviews, many people love this book and Holman is a clever writer.  But I did not enjoy the style of writing and could not finish the book.	2002-02-15

What interests me is where Ackroyd had the idea to make Hawksmoor a Satanist and to interpret the architecture of these churches so as to see occult references everywhere.<br />The story itself, though, was heavy-going and I almost did not finish the book. The book, whilst interesting, was somewhat disappointing compared to Ackroyd's other works. (I previously reviewed this in 1999 and my opinion has not changed)  <br />If you are interested in Peter Ackroyd or historical London, his biographies of Dickens and London are terrific.	2002-02-15

Perhaps I am wrong about this and the work becomes more objective as it develops, but I suspect anyone with a Unionist point of view may find this is not the book for them.  My background is Irish Catholic and whilst I know there have been injustices in the past, I am by no means an IRA sympathiser.

I loved the premise of this book - famous novelists are being murdered in the manner of their books.  Very cool idea.  Fiona is an interesting character in that she is not a cop, she is a scientist.  By the end of the novel, she is such a fully fleshed person that you are excited and scared for her in a way, for example, that you can no longer be for characters like Kay Scarpetta or Tempe Brennan who have escaped death's clutches one too many times to make any future novels suspenseful.  The fact that the ending is formulaic - what else could it be? - does not detract from the genuine enjoyment of the story.  If you are getting bored of Minette Walters and Ruth Rendell, try Val McDermid.	2002-02-14

This is a book about modern Indian women living in Britain and their struggle to assymilate two very different cultures.  I have many Indian friends, and the women portrayed in this novel are very typical.

There are many other books as well which discuss the experience of Indian women.<br />This book is interesting because it deals with both of these subjects and from the perspective of two Sikh women.  I have many Indian friends and know a little of Hindu and Moslem culture but of Sikhism I was ignorant and this novel has been a ssuperb introduction.  The story focuses to a large extent upon the experiences of Satya and Roop, married to the same man.  Both of their lives and their happiness are dependent on his and it is interesting to see how the two women manage to carve their own niches within this restriction.<br />Major themes of this book are jealousy and fear.  The fear of men, the fear of one's own body, the fear of strangers and of other religions.  Jealousy and avarice too.  The opening scene embodies all of these emotions as Satya inspects the young Roop, newly arrived at her husband's home wearing Satya's jewellry.  It is a fantastically written introduction.  However, despite his insensitivity and self-centredness, one of the wonderful things about this novel is observing the gradual transformation of Sardiji, a traditional and dominant male figure at the beginning of the novel into a thoughtful and generous one at the end.  His political and personal journey is directly attributable to the influence, and destinies, of his wives.<br />This book is not at all formulaic and is a worthy addition to the canon of modern Indian literature.  I have read many of these books and, as recommended by another reviewer, this is the best novel about India I have read since A Suitable Boy.	2002-01-25

This book is challenging in the kind of way that &quot;Ulysses&quot; is challenging - at times it can be a tough read, trying to follow what is going on.  <br />There is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of the author in this book.  Some reviewers have pointed this out but have excused this behaviour on the basis that Eggers is clearly aware when he is being so.  I could never make up my mind whether Eggers was being annoying.  I can't work out whether this book has been written with Eggers' tounge firmly in his cheek - I think so, but the fact that the subject matter and the humour in this book is at its heart the harrowing death of his parent and the aftermath makes for (at times) uncomfortable reading.  <br />The book is, however, extremely wonderful in many respects.  The best parts are without question the sections of the book where Eggers relays memories of the time with Toph, with his mother and his poignant trip back to Chicago.  Eggers was always amusing when describing his fears about the babysitters!	2002-01-16

I loved that a significant part of it explores the lives Claire and Jamie led without each other.  You feel sad for them, especially Jamie, who cuts a rather tragic romantic hero.

I am not sure I understand, still, the narrative relationship of the story of a young, somewhat naive, Scottish girl to that of a group of French villagers struggling to survive under Vichy France.  I have not understood Faulks message here.  <br />However, this is nevertheless a marvellous book because it presents an aspect of World War II that I had never really thought about before.  I was quite ignorant of the complicity of the French towards their German occupiers.  This was quite shocking to me.  I wish the whole book was set in Vichy and that we did not have to deal with the storyline of Charlotte and Peter Gregory.  The real heart of the novel is the story of the Levades and the story of occupied France.  I recommend this book to anyone who would be interested in a different insight to the war.	2001-11-01

Had he been born without the poetic imagination, he would have written treatises on the Origin of Evil.

Elements of the Religious Right in America are proponents of the very scary beliefs that are devastatingly explored in Atwood's groundbreaking work.   I do not read feminist literature but this book appealed to me both as an intelligent person and, moreover, as a young woman.  <br />It is an extremely clever book with many thought provoking ideas.  What people tend to gloss over, however, is that this book also contains a marvellous story.  It is set in the near future, a world which seems vaguely familiar but is yet deeply strange, and there is a great deal of suspense.  It is a captivating novel on many levels.

She has many qualities which are not remotely admirable - she is extremely selfish, a hypocrite, deceitful and above all, self-absorbed.  Alice is a &quot;me me me!&quot; person.  These facets of her character never really disappear although she undoubtedly matures as the novel goes on.  <br />Despite all this, Alice is mesmerising and you follow her story with your heart in your mouth, desperate to know whether she and Lin will overcome the many obstacles and be together.  If I had more time and space, and not be able to give away the ending,  I would write about the poignant Dr Lin.   Can they make a movie about this book with Chow Yun-Fat as Lin?  That would be truly fabulous!<br />The search for Peking Man is a wonderful back-drop as they travel through Northern China and Mongolia.   The resolution of this mystery is equally as gripping as the romance of the protagonists.  This book has truly got it all, love, history, death, disease and a fascinating introduction to modern China and the Cultural Revolution.  Go ahead, read it, you will not be disappointed.	2001-02-13

It is an interesting device and provides a different perspective on Mr Reagan who is an enigma to a person of my generation.  What is he like??  Even now, when you hear people talk of the President, there is a vagueness about what he is like as a person.  I really would like to find out more about his personality and what made him tick.  How did a Hollywood B-actor get to be the leader of the world?<br />For such an opaque personality, nothing would have been more tedious than to have read a biography of Reagan that is as dry as sandpaper, listing facts like phone-book numbers.  I think the author has tried to give us a sense of what the character of the man is like and on this I think Morris has succeeded moderately well.<br />I did, however, find the many sections of the book dealing with the fictional life of the narrator and his imaginary conversations with his pals on subjects not remotely connected to Ronald Reagan distracted from the book.  Eventually I had to skim read these passages as I found them too frustrating. I think Morris's editor was looking elsewhere, or was consumed with panic over the narration technique, and failed to take a decent red pen to the text itself where this merited it.<br />Like another critic below, I find myself at the end of this book wanting to know more about the enigmatic Mr Reagan and fear I will have to buy one of those sandpaper books in order to do it.  It is a real shame because otherwise I think Mr Morris deserves praise for presenting a view of Mr Reagan to us that might otherwise have been missed.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone - it is most certainly an experience!!  But if you are looking for a nuts and bolts biography with every little fact thrown in, this will not be the biography for you.	2001-02-07

I love the little anecdotes that just make you smile (the Queen Mum being inseminated by a turkey baster is my personal favourite).  <br />Does this give you a taster for the most celebrated piece of Faction of the 1990s?

Eleanor reigned her domains at a time when women had no power, no prestige and her achievements are therefore all the more remarkable.  Such a snakepit she had to operate within.  <br />Eleanor reigned, however, during a time when England was never more Continental.  Her story is a fascinating introduction to this period of English and medieval history.  It is a shame, however, that there is not more information extant about this significant woman.  Her children were no less than Richard the Lionheart and King John; her husband, Henry II, the king who created the common law and the king who also ordered the murder of Thomas Becket.  Eleanor would be top on the list of any fantasy dinner party.  An interesting and enigmatic woman, Alison Weir's book is a welcome addition to the genre of historical biography.	2000-10-24

An incidental fact:<br />My copy of this book (bought in the UK) is called  &quot;The Great Shame: A Story of the Irish in the Old World and the  New&quot;.<br />Do you not think it is interesting that the real title of this  book (ie. the &quot;triumph&quot; of the Irish in the English-speaking  world&quot;) says a lot about the continuing ambivalence of modern-day  English people to the Irish?

I wanted to read this one so much, I bought it in hardcover!<br />However, I found this book quite unsatisfying.   Kathy is falling into the  trap of creating a heroine that has 99 lives.   Anyone who has been through the cumulative experiences that Tempe has  suffered over the past 3 books would be in a psycho ward.  This insults the  reader's intelligence.  Plus, the way in which her relatives and lovers  become inextricably involved in the plot at the risk of death is also  ridiculous.<br />I hated the Andrew Ryan plot in this book.  It is very  disappointing that Reichs made him such a major character in Deja Dead but  then to hardly use him at all in this third book!  I confess one of the  reasons I bought this book now was that I wanted to find out how his and  Tempe's romance progressed.    I was let down.<br />As you will see from other  reviews on this page, there is no doubt that Kathy Reichs still pleases her  legions of fans and certainly if you are looking for scientific and medical  blood and gore, Reichs does not disappoint.  However, I am worried that as  time goes on, Kathy's books will fall into Patricia Cornwellidiom.  One of  the reasons I think Kathy is so popular is because Kay Scarpetta books are  now so far-fetched.  PLEASE, Please, Kathy, keep your eye on the ball!	2000-08-14

It  is a ghostly, sad place, very reminiscient of European concentration camps.   <br />Often convicts were sent to Australia  for doing nothing but stealing a  piece of bread.  Robert Hughes' absorbing book is a poignant testimonial to  their story.  You will find no better book about early Australian convict  history than this one.	2000-08-14

Privilege!<br />The life of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, reads like a movie.  What a  fascinating and absorbing life this woman led!  To her fans and detractors,  she was a beautiful, glamourous woman who exerted much power and influence.   Her fashions were copied, her male friendships were gossiped about, her  soirees were the parties to be seen at.<br />Behind the scenes she was deeply  unhappy, bulimic, a gambler, locked in a menage-a-trois with her husband.   She embarked on a foolish love affair and paid dearly for it.  Still, her  adoring public loved her all the more.<br />Parallels can (and will) be drawn  to Diana, Princess of Wales, who like Georgiana came from the Spencer  family.  I found Foreman's book to be an interesting insight into a  vanished world of privilege and wealth.  If you are interested in popular  history, then this is a book for you.	2000-08-14

It is instead a book about the Germans  and, more importantly, the legacy of the Holocaust which has been left to a  new generation who have had to deal with the disturbing and sometimes cruel  knowledge of what their parents and loved ones may have done (or failed to  do) during the Nazi era.<br />When reading this book, I found myself wondering  what I would be like if I were a young modern German and had to deal with  the knowledge that my parents and grandparents did nothing to stop the  horror of those times or perhaps may have actively contributed to it.   Michael has the misfortune to fall in love with an older woman who was  complicit in a horrible crime.  The question that torments him is this; how  can I be a good, warm, loving person if the person I love more than any  other has done such a terrible thing?  The story of Hanna, and his own  inexplicable love and regard for her, haunts him throughout his life.   Michael's quest to understand why this should be so is the basis for much  of this subtly compelling book. <br />Perhaps it is the banality of Hanna's  secret - ie. that she is illiterate - that is the reason some reviewers  have felt disappointed by this book.   We are so used to stories of the  Holocaust such as &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; where the magnitude of the  suffering seems to dwarf anything we could possibly imagine and if that is  the type of story you are looking for, &quot;The Reader&quot; will not  deliver that.  However, the value of this work is that it looks at another  aspect of the Holocaust, that is to say, the way in which young Germany has  had to try to come to terms with the crimes of the past.  This is an  interesting subject to me.   <br />If you do not want to read yet another  forumlaic book about those dreadful times, and if you want your mindto be  open to another perspective of the Holocaust, then I recommend that you  read this book.	2000-06-09

But am I so glad that I took the plunge and ordered it.  I have not enjoyed a mystery novel as much as this  one in a very long time.  The plot twists and turns with as many potential  murderers as stars in the sky.  Combine this with a wonderfully laconic  sheriff, Jules Clement, great scenery, a large dose of romantic tension  plus a lot of wit, sarcasm and humour, and you have one of the best crime  novels you will have read in a while.

Patricia said that in this book she wanted to explore Kay's own  reaction to grief, bearing in mind that until now Kay has always dealt with  the grief of other people.  I thought this was an interesting idea and thus  bought the book.  <br />My only complaint about this idea is that Scarpetta  did not fall to pieces over the death of her beloved boyfriend Mark from an  IRA bomb at Victoria station (one of the more sillier plotlines Cornwell  has used, I might add) to the extent she has done so over Benton.  But this  is a minor quibble!<br />Like many readers I share some of the criticisms  about the &quot;james bondisation&quot; of the main characters and  Cornwell's obsessions with the sexuality of her characters.  It would be  good if Kay could stay in Richmond for one novel at least!  Lucy is no  longer a credible character but Cornwell (at least) alluded to this via  some of the comments made by Marino in Black Notice about Lucy's latest  somewhat deranged escapades.  The Diane Bray storyline seemed a bit  pointless - I mean, why would Diane Bray give a rat's *** about Kay  Scarpetta?  She is just a forensic examiner for crying out loud!!  And Jay  was poorly characterised.  It would also be good if next time Cornwell  could drop the killer chasing after Scarpetta storyline - that really is  tired now and we all know Kay will survive!  There is absolutely no  suspense in that route at all and as other reviewers have said, it was all  so predictable.<br />But for some reason I found Black Notice to be a  compelling read and I enjoyed it much more than I have some of the more  recent Cornwell fare. The murders were interesting and I did not spot the  resolution of the baby hair.  I think some of the reviewers have been a bit  harsh on the technical aspects of this book which, as ever, were second to  none.   ANOTHER TIP - Patricia Cornwell said in the radio interview that  she is developing an interest in archaeology and has been going on digs,  looking at skeletons, etc.  This reminded me of the Kathy Reichs novels  where the main character is a forensic anthrolopolgist.  Is this going to  be a future Scarpetta storyline?  Watch this space...	1999-09-28

The historical detail in this book is fabulous - I work opposite Christ Church in Spitalfields and I am intrigued to know more about the real Nicholas Hawksmoor.  What interests me is where Ackroyd had the idea to  make Hawksmoor a Satanist and to interpret the architecture of these  churches so as to see occult references everywhere.<br />The story itself,  though, was heavy-going and I almost did not finish the book.

I enjoyed it, but the fact that this is an early work shines through.  Some of the plot structure seemed clumsy, although it was not clear to me whether this was the fault  of the translation.  I was not keen on Torsson's side-kick - he was a very  immature character and deserved a good slap at times!!!<br />However, the  north of Sweden and the land of the Arctic Circle is a fascinating location  for a crime novel.  The story is engrossing and different and I doubt any  reader will be overly disappointed.  If you are a fan of the author, you  will find the development of her skills quite fascinating - nearly 30 years  separates this novel and Blackwater.

I bought this collection after having seen The Invention of Love on the London stage.<br />Most beautiful of all, to my mind, is the poem entitled &quot;To an Athlete Dying  Young&quot;.  This was the eulogy read by Isak Dinesen at Denys  Finch-Hatton's funeral in the movie &quot;Out of Africa&quot;.  The poem,  which was originally included in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; (1896)  begins:<br />&quot;The time you won your town the race,  We chaired you  through the market place.   Man and boy stood cheering by  and home we  brought you shoulder high.   Today the road all runners come, Shoulder-high  we bring you home. And set you at your threshold down, Townsman of a  stiller town. Smart lad! to slip betimes away  from fields where glory does  not stay And early though the laurel grows It withers quicker than the  rose... And round that early laurelled head Will flock to gaze the  strengthless dead, And find, unwithered on its curls, A garland.  Briefer  than a girl's.&quot;  <br />A very moving and sad poem.  Many of Housman's  other poems are of a similar, outstanding quality.  He was not a prolific  poet, but he was certainly a great one.  Great pleasure will be found in  this collection.	1999-02-02

Why? It is the story of Mary Bell who at the age of 10 years murdered two little boys and was found guilty of the crime in an adult court of law. The book has been reviled in the British press because, 30 years after the killings, Gitta Sereny has interviewed Mary Bell herself to try to understand why these terrible events happened. The crux was that Gitta Sereny paid Mary Bell for her time and this has opened up a moral can of worms: should criminals be seen to benefit financially from their crimes?<br />Controversy over this issue has blinded many in Britain to the merits of this book although Sereny explains in her work why she felt it appropriate to pay Ms Bell. I tend to agree with Sereny since there can be little point in investigating these sorts of crimes unless we can hear directly from the perpetrator as to why they acted the way they did. In order to prevent children killing children, surely we need to understand what it is that has driven these kids to kill? In nearly all cases, Sereny argues, the behaviour of these children can be traced to a trauma in childhood. Mary Bell herself had a damaged childhood and the killings of these boys were her cry for help. These cries were unheard since Mary was sent to an adult prison where she became institutionalised. It is only now that Mary has understood what she has done and her remorse would appear to be genuine. The book carefully records her life in excruiting detail and I would defy anyone not to be horrified by the various ordeals that she has suffered.<br />The story of Mary Bell carries many lessons, particularly for those who deal with child criminals and children who are in care. But it also carries a wider message; in order to prevent these tragedies happening again, we need to be alert to the &quot;cries&quot;. <br />I should emphasise that in no way does the book attempt to justify what Mary Bell did. Both the author and Mary herself fully accept that she was guilty as charged and that there can be no reparations to the families who lost their children.<br />I was profoundly taken with Ms Sereny's book. I was sad for the child victims and I was moved by Mary herself. If you are of an open mind, and you really want to understand why little children do such terrible things, you will want to read this book. I would particularly recommend it to anyone who is interested in child psychology or even in why people do what they do. Don't take the moral high ground: the lessons to be learned from the story of Mary Bell are far, far too important to be ignored.	1998-12-03
