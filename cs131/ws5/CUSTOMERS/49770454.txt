I was dissapointed with volume 1 - probably with a stronger sense than normal since I spent so much money on it. Schama tried to cover several thousand years in one rather slim volume and it didn't work. <br />Nevertheless I ventured into the second volume and within the first fifty pages realized that at least part of my money was well spent. Volume two is much more focused, covering approximately 175 years. As another reviewer has observed this volume consists of an in-depth look at 17th century England. It's an excellent account of the English Civil War,Oliver Cromwell dictatorship, and the Restoration of the English monarchy. The chapter on the Restoration is over seventy pages long, a well written account of twenty - eight years. In comparison Schama covers several centuries in the same amount of space in volume one and it shows.<br />Schama also examines England during the eighteenth century; covering the beginning of the British Empire, the birth of modern caitalism, unification of England and Scotland and, of course, the American Revolution. This part is also well written and researched, but I found the first half to be suspenseful as well as insightful and dramatic. The second half tends towards a drier academic air - not a bad thing, just not as gripping.<br />Schama is a narrative historian, more of a storyteller than an academic. His writing is fast moving and he isn't afraid to take a stand, even if it tends to go against the popular opinion. The book itself consists of good quality paper and binding and it has some very nice illustrations throughout. While I have a few quibbles with his style, I think he should of had annotated notes at the end for example, overall I'm very impressed with the second volume. It isn't cheap, but it's worth it. I'll keep both books on my shelf, but I definitely see myself referingto volume two more often.	2002-03-07

Pakenham has written a book which resists the easy path of political correctness and dosen't engage in simple minded ideology. He has attempted to show both sides as truthfully as possible. His one very daring act is the effort to show General Buller in a different light - going against decades of historians that have written him off as nothing but an incompetent. Just another example of the idiots that were in charge of the British military in the ninteenth century, as if comptence in the British Army ceased to exsist after Wellington died. It is a bold attempt and one which I believe Pakenham does very well. <br />Pakenham also excells in his effort to show how very difficult it is to maintain control of troops on the battlefield. Garbeled communications, faulty intelligence,monumental egos, morale, unexpected effects of new weapons metting up with outdated tactics - all of these and more are detailed beautifully by Pakenham. I was somewhat suprised that the Boers are shown as not all conquering and often had even more problems then the British. Their troops were wildly undisciplined and were better at partisan warfare or serving in defensive actions. When it came to offensive action against disciplined troops the Boers were actually miserable failures. This is a common trait found in what is now know as \\"irregular forces\\". Pakenham looks at both sides and shows that war could have been avoided at almost every step, but personal and national egos and ambition kept getting in the way. Naturally Pakenham draws the inevitable comparisons to World War One and they are very clear. <br />All in all this is a balanced and very readable work. When I first picked it up I was unsure of what I would find. In the past I've found many of the modern African historians to be extremely left wing and lacking in perspective. Pakenham is an exception to the rule and for that I give him five stars. Well done!	2002-01-23

Two days later I was glad I took a chance. A powerful book. All the cliches come to mind, of course, and they all work.This book lacks the acid of Graves biography, it's sadder, in many respects it's deeper and has a sense of humanity that one never finds in Graves or Sasson. One should read this book if for no other reason then to look at WW1 with a different perspective.It gives you a sense of what pre-war England was like and what was lost in the trenches, both the physical and spiritual cost.

He spent most of that summer in the hospital and my mother bought him dozens of books to read - cable was still in it's infancy and VCR's were few and far between. She focused on buying big thick books and Shogun was one of these books. I was nine years old at the time and utterly fascinated by it's thickness. When the mini-series aired four years later I watched all of it with my parents. I remember the plot being complicated and difficult to follow, but I did enjoy the overall atmosphere and ,of course, the many action scenes. I especially liked the Ninja sequence.<br />Now, over twenty years later, I've finally read the novel and enjoyed it tremendously. It's fast moving, engrossing and exciting. It does exactly what the best of this genere should do. It takes you away and makes you feel as if you're actually in another time and place. What more can one ask? <br />And yet I couldn't help noticing some of the other reviewers critiques of Calvell's incorrect use of Japanese words, expressions etc.The fictionalizing of historical personas, incorrect depections of various martial arts, and just his overall depiction of old Japan. So in defense of the late Mr. Clavell I'm going to address some of these points. First of all Mr. Clavell began writing Hollywood screenplays back in the fifties. You can see his name in the credits for Gunfight at the OK Corral with Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster. In his day fictional authors created thinly disguised fictional characters in place of the actual people and events. It was considered tactless to write a work of fiction with actual persons interacting with fictional protaganists. Mr.CLavell did just this when he wrote Shogun. When looked at in these terms it makes sense. As far as the arrogance of his changing of Japanese history and comparing it to a foreign film in which the name of George Washington is changed......well there have been foreign films made in the pastwhich have &quot;messed&quot; with our history. A good example would have to be the Sergio Leone westerns, but there are others. Like it or not, Clavell wasn't writing for a Japanese audience. His book was for readers that knew pratically nothing about pre-Tokugawa Japan.I have to say this is one reason why he has his characters using Judo and other modern martial arts. The average American in 1975 had heard of Judo, but I doubt they knew what jijitsu and others were. For those readers with truly curious natures I don't doubt they went on and learned more on their own. Never forget that this is a work of fiction first and formost.<br />Does Clavell engage in some idolization of Japanese culture? Yes. But is that necessarily a bad thing? Clavell was a man who admired Asia. Writers have the privlige of putting their worldview into their work and Clavell does just that in Shogun.This is one reason why I've grown tired of reading fiction. But, in Shogun, I didn't find it overbearing and tiresome. This is a skillfully written piece of popular fiction, deserving of it's rating. It isn't a coincidence this book is still in print after twenty-five years or that the mini-series is available. To read this book and others like it one needs to check one's self-importance at the door and go in with a easy going attitude.<br /> Believe me I know. I used to be soldier and now I'm a cop. If I allowed myself to be infuriated over all the innaccuracies that I constantly catch in books and movies about cops and soldiers I'd never be able to enjoy anything. So relax and enjoy. It's lots of fun, and what more can one ask for?	2001-08-19

It is a sucsessful endeavor.<br /> The book is lavishly illustrated with drawings from various military training manuals from the time as well as modern photos illustrating the difficulty of accurately using a smoothbore cannon against advancing troops.<br />This is not a general history of the armies of this time. It dosen't concern itself with the social aspects of the armies or their respective societies. An excellent book for that would be Christopher Duffy's work; &quot;The Military Experience in the Age of Reason&quot;. This book concerns itself with the physical effects of the weaponry on the battlefield proper, both strengths and weaknesses.<br />While a trifle dry in parts, for the most, it keeps one's interest and is an intelligently written work. Though a specialist work it is a great contribution to the study of military history during the Age of Reason as well as the Napoleonic Wars. It even has a place as an addendum in an American Civil War collection since so many of the weapons and tactics examined were still being used in the 1860's. A good addition to one's collection.	2001-08-10

My father had been there and served his tour of duty in 65-66. But this book is on the mark. I first read it in 87 when I was in the R.O.T.C. program at Boise State University.<br />  Just young cadet fascinated by all things having to do with the Army.At the time I felt that the book captured the feel and the rythms of Army life. Whether that be the peacetime Army or the wartime Army.    At the time there were still many Vietnam vets in the service and I gave this book to one of the cadre members(a sergeant major) to read. He had served two tours over there and when he finished reading it he told me that the authors had done a better job of capturing the war in all it's nuances then all the other Vietnam novels he had read. No weird musings on the nature of man and no bizzare drug induced fantasies that so many other authors were turning out in the seventies and early eighties. Just a straight forward story.I've since reread this novel twice. The first time was about three years ago and then just last week. I'm older now and my attitude towards things have changed.I have found that often those things which seemed so impressive to me at the age of nineteen are diminished at the age of thirty-three. Well this novel hasn't lost anything. It's still wonderfully detailed, suspenseful, humorous and intelligent. One could do far worse this summer then reading this book. Unfortunately it's out of print, but I still see copies floating around in used book stores - both in paperback and hardcover. Good luck and, when you get a copy,enjoy.	2001-06-22

It's also a well written historical text. It isn't a in-depth historical text that one might read at university level, but I found that to be refreshing.It is a popular history and there is nothing wrong with that. It also is a valuable addition to the television series, not just filler.It's beautifully illustrated and I like the fact that Mr. Fleming focused on the military aspects, a facet of the conflict that all too many historians ignore - for some inexplicable reason. He isn't a revisionist historian and he dosen't look at the Revolution in cynical terms. I found it to be a good read and having greater depth than one usually finds in so-called coffee table books. I purchased my copy at the book store in the basement of the Smithsonian's American History museum. I'm glad I went with my impulse because this is a nice book. If you should be able to find a copy go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it.	2001-04-26

Much about how my department functions and how the NYPD works is very different. But I've also been suprised to see there is more that my dept has in common with the gigantic NYPD. Dee is expert at capturing the feeling of law enforcement, the undeniable truths of being a cop no matter where you're at. this is Dee's best work to date. He takes his characters to new levels, and his writing has achieved a sophistication. It's a daring move in having one of the characters lose his son, but it's effective. Not something that one sees very often in a book franchise. All in all I can't reccommend Dee's books highly enough. I find his work to be engrossing and fast moving, he's one of the authors whose newest book I'm always keeping an eye out for. Try him. I think he'll enjoy his books as much as I do.	2001-04-20

But what I especially like about Ian Hogg is that he's actually rather witty. Hardly what one would expect from a technical reference work, such as this.

Though he writes about a variety of military history topics his primary focus is the 16th - 18th centuries and the type of warfare they fought. It's always been an area that has interested me, but I never found much quality and in-depth material.Christopher Duffy has corrected that problem. This book takes every aspect of the military experience from 1715 - 1789 and looks at it in great depth. The officer, the common soldier, the general, campaigns, battles etc. It's very readable and beautifully researched. Each before mentioned topic has it's own chapter as do many others in the book and they all recieve equal attention. It works as both a survey book for the general reader and a in-depth study for the more knowledgable scholar. I reccommend it strongly. If one is wondering about any quibbles I may have, and there always are quibbles, it would be that the book could have used some illustrations, but that's a minor quibble indeed. If your interested in this subject or just military history in general you could do far worse than buying this book.	2001-01-04

His objective is to capture the sights and sounds of an area, event, profession. His writing style is very dramatic but readable. There is nothing melodramatic or corny about his works. Somehow he always manages to hit the nail on the head. The reader is left thinking, &quot;Yeah, that's right. That's what it's like.&quot; or, &quot;Damm that's the truth. That's why I'm a cop or a soldier&quot;. So to use the overworked phrase -  Stroud's books are very truthful. Deadly Force takes you into not only the world of the Marshals, but the world of the fugitive. And the end result is that you're glad those fellas are out there doing the job. I recommend all of Stroud's books. Deadly Force isn't his best work, but it's still right up there.He lacks Clancey's verbosity which I find to be a relief. It keeps your attention and it has some very suspenseful moments. Some nice attention to details as well, though there are some technical errors I found them to be forgiveable. Good book.

For once a historian has written a book that looks at the possible reasons why the Western Roman Empire didn't survive and the Eastern half did. Instead of brushing over the topic with the usual cliches Cromwell actually looks at the possibilities in depth. For too many years I've only been able to find brushovers on this time period. Cromwell takes it on directly and in doing so fills in a rather mysterious era. This is a short work, but it dosen't leave the reader feeling shorted.It belongs in all history buff's libraries be it Roman, military history or both.	2000-12-07

I like police work in all it's glory. I also see similarities in this novel and what I've experienced, but I think the crucial thing to point out is that Kent Anderson was a cop in the mid-seventies. Maybe things are worse now, but I don't agree.The country was exhausted after the sixties and Watergate and nobody cared about the state of affairs. The cops were trying to deal with a bad situation with limited resources and in many cases not the greatest people were wearing the uniform. The city I work in has it's problems and it's bad areas, but the cops I serve with aren't burnouts and alcoholics. Times have changed and people have changed. It's a good novel and it takes you into the streets, but it isn't necessarily how it is anymore. I truely belive this.	2000-11-02

Philip Warner recreates a complete picture of daily life in a medieval castle: how peasants and nobles lived; how men fought in tournaments and trained for combat; how castles were sited, designed, managed, attacked and defended; and what the the people who lived in them ate, drank, and wore. This book will also go a long ways toward breaking up some of the preconceived notions that people have about castles. One learns that the castle was not primarily a refuge. The object of the castle wasn't to retreat from conflict, but to control it. The Medieval castle was a dynamic integral part of medieval society and Philip Warner does brilliant work in showing this. Whether you're a medieval history buff or just a curious layman read this book. It will take a little effort to find it, but it's worth the time.	2000-10-01

This book is an excellent read, but I also feel like it's somewhat dated. Most of the interviews were conducted in 1983 and 1984. There's a whole new generation of police officer out there now. Attitudes have changed, training has changed, and I suppose society has changed somewhat. When I first read this book back in 1986 my father was still a cop with six years to go before he retired. At the time the book was dead on. Now, though it is still truthful in spirit, I feel like cops have chnged in many respects. It would be nice to see an update. I would also like Mr. Baker to go farther out into this country of ours and speak to cops in the Western U.S., the South and so on. I get the definite impression that many of his interviews were conducted with NYPD officers and Long Island cops. Contrary to what some may think law enforcement is different in various parts of the nation, just like attitudes and beliefs are different in our many regions. It's still a very good book. Don't let my quibbles discourage you from reading it.	2000-09-30

At the time I didn't give much thought to the main character and his willingness to cross the ethical line to &quot;get the job done&quot;. What I mean by that is a willingness to lie on the witness stand amd shoot a suspect in the back and then lie to the investigators. The protaganist even goes so far as to buy clothing that makes him more credible to a jury as he lies. The overall feeling I got was it was no deal because our hero is doing this for us. He's on the side of the angels. Fast forward five years. Now I'm a police officer ( just hired ) and I have just finished this book for a second time. While it is still engrossing and exciting I am very uncomfortable with Mr. Mahoney's brezzy attitude towards professional ethics and just ethics in general.The profession of law enforcement is a difficult one and it's very easy to cross that line for the the greater good, but once you've done it there's no going back. It simply isn't worth it and I'm uncomfortable with even a novel that takes such a lighthearted approach to such a serious issue. Now I can already hear others saying, &quot;It's just a novel&quot; , and so it is. Just don't forget that fact as you read. It is a very exciting novel. I just wish Mr. Mahoney had opted to portray an officer who dosen't view ethical behavior as something imposed by idiot superiors.	2000-09-25

All of Ed Dee's books ring with authenticity and they move fast. I've never put one of his books down because I found myself bored or disgusted with the lack of accuracy. Sonething that I have done many times with Waumbaugh, won't even read his books anymore. I'm a police officer in the West and I've only worn a uniform for a short while. But while my city may not be the Big Apple and my department's entire force wouldn't fill up one small precinct building Ed Dee writes with complete authenticity.

Stephen Williams is not a professional Roman historian instead he is a professor of philosophy and therin lays the books strength.  Williams writes for the enthusiastic Roman buff and the general reader.  Instead of quoting ancient historians ad nauseum and going off on tangents  he gets to the meat of the matter. How Diocletion and his fellow emperors  were able to pull the empire back from total collapse. He gives detailed  explanations as to what was occurring in the Empire during the 3rd Century  and why. He isn't afraid to offer his own theories where our knowledge of  events are sketchy and he always keeps the book moving along at a brisk  pace. I especially enjoyed the final chapter where he covers the collapse  of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. It's well written with  a  detailed description of what occurred and why. He also contrast the  collapse of the West with the survival of the Eastern Empire. Wonderful  book for the layman, student, and perhaps even the expert.	2000-07-31

It used the forensic approach, with each chapter looking at the soldiers uniforms, daily exsistence, equipment, organization, leadership,  training, installations, and of curse how the Roman Army fought it's many  wars. Webster's book has since become the touchstone for this area. Some  fifteen years ago Dr. Lawrence Keppie wrote The Making Of the Roman Army.  Taking the political viewpoint he showed the evolution of the Roman Army  from the days of the late Republic to the early Empire. together the two  books make a fine set. The Roman Cavalry completes it. Long overlooked by  historians thanks to only sketchy information from Roman writers ( the  Romans were not horse people ) this work sets out to fill in some gaps.  Relying not only on Roman works, but cavalry works from before the Roman  Empire and as recently as the nineteenth century the authors manage to fill  in those areas which until now have remained blank. The writers also rely  on recent archeological finds that have helped to broaden our knowledge of  the Roman cavalry. Not suprisingly they have choosen to follow Graham  Webster's approach amd each chapter deals with a certain aspect of the  horse soldier. Their equipment and weapons, training and recruitment, daily  living, tactics and battle, religion, etc. Handsomely illustrated the book  is very readable, never lagging, and well researched. A very admirable  effort considering the lack of research material.	2000-07-17

I've always believed that some of David Drake's best works are his novels mixing science fiction and the Roman Empire. Having been a Roman history buff for as long as I can remember one could argue that I'm rather biased,  but in my opinion Ranks of Bronze rates up there with another of his Roman  novel's, Birds of Prey. Ranks of Bronze takes it's inspiration from an  actual battle that occurred in the year 53 B.C. Marcus Crassus - one of the  three members of the first triumvite along with Ceaser and Pompey - led a  Roman army into Parthia ( modern Iran ) to take care of the Parthian empire  once and for all. Instead his army was defeated and Crassus was killed.  What we do know is that some ten thousand legionaires survived and were  either sold into slavery to owners as far away as China and India or the  Parthians put them to work as slave soldiers setteling frontier land within  the Pathian Empire,just like the British did in Austraila. David Drake has  the survivors being sold to aliens - in disguise - who work for a star  spanning commercial league. Rather like the organization that was attacking  Naboo in The Phanthom Menace. The League isn't allowed to use modern  weaponry against primitives who refuse to deal with them. I gather the  rules are put down by an organiztion similar to our U.N. So in order to  stay out of trouble the aliens buy the Roman legionaries and put them to  work fighting their wars. The clincher is that excluding total destruction  of the brain the aliens can ressurect the dead soldiers, even if they are  decapitated. The main character is a young tribune who eventually rises to  command of the legion and the realization that their masters aren't Human.  The battles are graphic, but show some  serious research on Drake's part.  The book gives a nod to the Human ability to overcome obstacles by brain  power and nothing else. It's also an intersting contrast of Iron Age  soldiers living among advanced technology. I don't want to spoil the  ending, but suffice to say you will be kept on the edge of your seat.To  paraphrase the previous review, Don't mess with the Romans.	2000-07-17
US	49770454	R3A5AZHMFB6PMA	040303082X	359155626	Outline of History (2 Volume Set)	Books	4	30	31	N	N	Still Original	I have the 1921 edition - the original which I picked up at a local second hand shop a few months ago for just $1.00. I had no idea that H.G. Wells had written a history text. Being a history buff and having earned my  degree in history I was suprised. I never heard this text mentioned once in  four and a half years of higher education - why? Well for one Mr. Wells  does not fit the academic mold nor does his book follow what is still  established doctrine for history texts. He has opinions about everything,  he dosen't hesitate to tell the reader what he thinks was wrong with  ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, Alexander ect. This isn't a man suffering  from hero worship. Being a fan of all things Roman I didn't necessary agree  with all his evaluations of the Empire and it's civilization, but I have to  respect his courage in stating it. This is a book which challenges the  reader to think. While Wells is guilty of ommission and some commission  which historian isn't? No this is a daring work and even though my addition  is eighty years old I found it very relevant and lacking in pretension. I'm  proud to have this book sitting on my shelves. Excellent.	2000-06-17

It isn't an easy thing combining two different generes but Drake pulls it off. Instead of plodding  I felt that the story progressed steadily building on top of each new  development. The reader identifies with the Roman agent and therefore as he  learns more so do you. For Roman buffs there is also a nice twist at the  end. I never saw it coming. An enertaining read.	2000-06-17

Mr. Grant is a superb Roman historian, but this  book is under 200 pages and is more of a handbook than anything else, but  it's a very good handbook. Full of pictures, illustrations and a very  readable text Mr. Grant gives the reader a look into the life of the  Gladiators and the society which loved to watch them fight and die. For  either the general reader or the more involved Roman history buff this book  is worth the money.	2000-06-17
US	49770454	R1QINP8QRKW9TL	0553089358	971078226	Lizard Skin	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Strong characters	I've reviewed Carsten Stroud in the past. I've always stressed his atmosphere and characters. In my opinion he excells in his books at being able to take you into the story and make you genuinely care for his  chatracters. the same is true of Lizardskin, but here his dialouge is also  very finely done. Yes the conclusion is a little weak but it's such a  pleasure getting there that I will readily forgive Mr. Stroud and his Robin  Cook ending. Actually I found myself enjoying the story so much that I  really wasn't in all that much of a rush to see it end. I have read this  novel several times over the years and every time I enjoy it immensely.  Read this novel if you enjoy storytelling at its finest.	2000-06-16

While Webster took the forensic approach to the Roman Army and focused on the physical structure ( armor, weapons, organization,  forts, etc. ) Dr. Keppie looks at the evolution of the army from the  republic to the early Empire and the role the army played in this  transition both positive and negative. When read in conjucture with Dr.  Webster the book fits in nicely. There are pictures, drawings, and layouts  of roman camps over diagrams of the archeological excavations of the actual  forts and camps. This a very easy/pleasurable read and would make a nice  additon to one's personal library.	2000-06-15
US	49770454	R2HSXRK9O19S3D	0380710811	272869729	The First Man in Rome	Books	4	4	6	N	N	The prequel to I,Claudius	First I have to compliment Colleen McCullough on her research. Truely an outstanding effort and very praiseworthy. Her glossary at the end of the book is excellent and one which I have referred back to more then once for  just general information. Having said that I now have to state that the  entire series has been going down in quality since the second installment  The Grass Crown. With the first two novels it is apparent that Ms.  McCullough wrote them more or less simultaneously over a period of several  years while doing her very extensive research. I read that she spent over  five years researching and writing the first chapters and it shows. The  attention to detail is excellent, her characters come to life, they sound  and act like Romans. There is nothing modern about her dialouge, plot, or  characterization. After a short while I felt like I was reading a prequel  to Robert Grave's classic novels about Claudius. The only thing I felt  there wasn't enough of was the biting wit that was so prevelant in Graves  work. Unfortunly starting with the third installment I saw the old Colleen  McCullough coming through. The bestselling author who has written The  Thornbirds and Tim. It was obvious that the research was done and the  dramatic stage set was built. Now Ms. McCullough is simply filling in with  her trademark writing. Instead of a series of Roman novels now we have a  soap opera with rather modern characters running around in togas. Instead  of intruiging and fleshed out historical personas we have hero worship of  Julius Ceaser and two dimensional characters. I made it through the fourth  installment and gave up. More tired then disgusted - for what had been  rather unusual has now become typical and could just as easily be set in  New York City of today. I reccommend the first two novels highly. In my  opinion they reach a level higher then the average summertime read, but  after that one has mind candy pure and simple. Instead read I, Claudius and  Claudius the God and his wife Messalina by Robert Graves if you want truly  enertaining fiction set in the Roman Empire. Vale.	2000-06-15

Books	4	55	56	N	N	Not light reading	Graham Webster's book is considered to be one of those definitive works on the Roman Army. It is most definitely that, but as previously noted it isn't for the beginner and/or the casual reader. Professor Webster writes  the book with the eye of an archeologist. The chapters are very specific  and dedicated to such topics as the soldiers clothes, armor, weapons,  religious practices, the layout of their camps and forts, their daily  rituals, tactics, organization in the field and in garrison. There are  other chapters as well but this gives you a clear idea of what the book is  about. It isn't an historical account of battles, campaigns, and politics.  No this is a book about the institution itself. For those who are truly  intruiged by Rome then this is the book for you. I've read it several times  over the past five years and I never grow tired of it. For a nice companion  book which covers the campaigns and politics read Hugh Elton or Lawrence  Keppie.	2000-06-15

A few years ago the Army sent me and my family to Germany for three years - which was a dream come true. While there I toured several of the old forts built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It's embarressing, but I the military history  enthusiast knew very little about these forts; the engineering, the  purposes behind their construction, how the sieges were conducted, nothing.  I realized that my knowledge of European warfare effectively ended in the  middle of the fifteen hundreds and didn't resume until the mid - eighteen  hundreds. The old fortresses fascinated me, thanks in a large part to the  fact that I couldn't dechipher the layout of the walls. Centuries of  vegetation, vandalism, urban growth, and decay had rendered many of the  forts almost non-exsistent. Fire and Stone has helped to correct much of  this. It is definitely a technical work and one written more for  specialists then the general reader. But it never ascends to a level where  the amatuer is simply left in the dirt. It has a wealth of drawings and  diagrams, photographs, and schematics. The captions are well written and  extremely helpful. There is also a very complete glossary at the back of  the book which is not only a necessity but a god send. All to often it  seems that authors forget such little details. Without the glossary this  book would be impossible to follow. Numerous French, Latin, German, and  Spanish terms for the various fortifications and their appendages are used,  sometimes different names for the same structure are used! The glossary is  an absolute must. The second half of the book is concerns the conduct of  a  siege for both the besieger and the besieged. Like the first half this part  also shows the same attention to detail but never forgets the reader. All  in all I have to give this book very high marks. Though it appeals only to  a small sector of history buffs I recommend it. And if you have ever  visitedsome of the old forts in Canada, such as Fort Henry in Kingston,  Ontario, and marveled at the old fortress and its layout this book just  might be for you as well.	2000-05-09

Over the past nineteen years I've re-read it more than once and every time I've enjoyed it along with the two sequels: Single  Combat and Wild Country. Yes there are elements in the series wich are now  obsolete,but that is beside the point. These books are beautifully  detailed, intelligent, suspenseful, and have some very well done action  sequences. They accomplish what good science fiction should do, they take  the reader to another reality and make it believable. My only complaint is  that there has never been a fourth installment in the series. At the end of  Wild Country ( released 1985) there are hints of what is coming in the next  instalment, but fifteen years later there is still no 4th part. Why? Yes it  is no longer applicable to the world of today but so what? Let's just say  it takes place in an alternate reality and get on with it. Please.  Otherwise pick up these book if you get the chance. In my opinion they are  three of Mr. Ing's best works.	2000-05-07

Mr. Stroud has always excelled at writing books heavy with atmosphere and he does a beautiful job here as well. At forst the reader is following what  seems to be two different story lines but both are very well done and one  never becomes bored with either one. Eventually they come together in a way  I found to be very satisfying. This is a book about honor, faithfulness,  blood ties, and redemption. It's also a very intruiging mystery which keep  one guessing almost to the end. The police procedure is believable and the  action sequences are beautiful. Mr. Stroud also excells at giving the  reader detailed descriptions on even the most minor characters so the  reader feels like he has known them for years. Unlike so many of the police  procedure thrillers this one takes a slighty different trail and does a  great job. Read it. I really think you won't be disapointed.	2000-05-07

This book does capture the essence of what soldiering is all about. Yes there are several technical errors, but I did not find them to detract from the power of the story. This book reveals the love/hate relationship that so many have with the  Army, any Army I dare say. Having departed the institution only a few  months ago I feel confident in saying this. There is so much to hate about  the profession of arms, but there are those few rare moments - sometimes  they occurred years ago - that you still treasure.Somehow those moments can  keep one going when everything is at it's worse. That is what Carsten  Stroud does in Iron Bravo. The book has wonderful atmosphere - one of  Stoud's strengths as a writer - and presents the mind of the professional  soldier beautifully. This book dosen't place the soldier on a platform, it  merely shows them warts and all. And in my opinion the soldier comes out  shining.	2000-04-28

Anyway I was rather disappointed in this work. The author was a former British Army officer and throughout his work there is a heavy  condescending air towards the Irish and their grievances. I felt like he  was saying that if the silly little Micks had simply been patient their  good and benevolent masters would have  taken care of everything.Very  unpleasent. I am not in anyway connected to the Irish Problem, but I found  myself with a growing dislike of the author's point-of-view. And I also  found the author to be very biased-which is intriuging since this book was  written in 1958 and the new outbreak of secterian violence in Northern  Ireland was over ten years away. He gives scant attention to the Irish  point of view and simply states that the majority of Irish simply wanted  peace. I found that to be simplistic. I give it two stars because he  dosen't gloss over the criminal acts of the police and British military  though he does try to rationalize them while ridiculing the IRA. I was  hoping for better things from this book. It's very difficult to find good  pieces on the Irish Rebellion and unfortunely this book is not a great  addition to my collection. I picked it up for a dollar in the bargain bin  at a local book store and now it will be going to my local library. But if  you know absolutely nothing about this period it is better then nothing. At  least it is a starting point for bigger and better things.	2000-04-27
US	49770454	R3106FADH34R5O	0553278746	957987582	The Postman	Books	3	15	16	N	N	Dosen't quite deliver	I have to go against the overwhelming tide of opinion that holds this novel to be an excellent work. The first half of the novel isn't bad as we accompany the protaganist and his effort to survive in post-apopcalyptic  America. The character isn't heroic. Instead he's a survivor. And then we  get started with the postman charade. At first it has potential - the  reestablishing of communications to rebuild civilization. The lowly mailman  suddenly stepping into a position as savior or at least rebuilder. The  mundane civil servant now is heroic. Very intruiging. But then David Brin -  ex-NASA scientist - has to bring in technology. Suddenly we have  genetically engineered super-soldiers and something called neo-hippie  technology. In one quick turn we are in some kind of world involving  ressurrected 1960's philosophy! The book wanders around, looking for some  kind of philosophical grounding. Why? Isn't it enough to have a story about  the rebuilding of the country? Or did David Brin become bored with such an  Earthy story and feel the need to go into space - so to speak. No I believe  this book suffers from a lack of focus. A good idea, but not carried out  completely.	2000-04-25

I have since read 1914 and now To The Last Man. She is the only World War One historian whose  works I have actually ever bothered to purchase. Like Ambrose or Cornelius  Ryan she captures the soldier's experience only she has done it for World  War One. Like most Americans my knowledge of WW1 is sorely lacking, but  after reading Somme I have embarked on a personal mission to correct that.  I have since read probably a dozen different books on the war and am a  semi-regular visitor to the Trenches On The Web forum and I owe it to Lyn  McDonald. For the novice her books are very well written and easy to  understand. All her books are very generous with detailed maps, both  official and ones sketched by the vets she has interviewed. She has quite a  few pictures and her pacing is excellent. For the knowledgable historian  her books can still offer a fresh perspective and would make a good  addition to any library collection on World War One. Also in contrast to  Liddle Hart and Wolffe her books are not brimming over with anger and  bitterness. No doubt due to the fact that McDonald was born after the war  and has the professional historian's perspective, but it does make for  easier reading. Though the anger and passion of the earlier historians is  understandable it can clutter a book at times. I strongly recommend not  only To The Last Man, but all of her works.	2000-04-10
