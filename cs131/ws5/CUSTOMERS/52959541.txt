This 02/03 yearbook, which is designed to keep the biannual Penguin Guide to Classical Music, is similar to its excellent forebears, and even has some improvements.  Of particular note is that DVDs are now included with CDs in the ratings rather than being segregated in its own section in back.  I would like to see Penguin continue this format when it publishes its 04 guide next year.	2003-04-16

As the Gramophone Guide continues to look for its voice, the Penguin Guide remains as reliable as ever in its new, easy to read, clean format.  Most readers know what Penguin offers - over 1,000 pages of concise disc reviews.  Now, Penguin is up against a wall as it has reached its maximum size and editors are soliciting ideas for the next ed. in two years - only including top choices, having two volumes, or relegating minor composers to the off year &quot;year book.&quot;  <br />Any choice Penguin makes will be fine so long as it does NOT opt for the choice Gramophone made - only rating and reviewing top selections while leaving other excellent recordings out.  This decision has rendered Gramophone's guide a distinct second place finisher to the Penguin Guide.<br />The Penguin Guide could only be improved with a comprehensive index of composers and artists.  Still, it's the best out there at the moment.	2002-04-01

First, every Verdi opera, no matter how minor, is givenn some space.  I prefer the approach he took in Wagner of omitting the less significant operas.  After all, these books are introductions.  Next, he has a chapter on different approaches to staging Verdi, but I find this less appealing that having a section on this subject within each opera.  There is more integration of analysis with synopsis in this work, whereas the Wagner book has the analysis seperate, which I prefered.  Still, this is an enjoyable book and beginning opera fans will benefit highly from it.	2000-11-15

Having used it to prepare for the Washington Opera's Parsifal, I found that the nearly five hour opera (which I had worried would be confusing and hence boring) flew by enjoyably.  Esp. interesting is his discussion of the different ways these operas have been staged.  Esp. USEFUL is his advice on when to eat, etc. and the other mechanics of actually attending these operas, which are among the longest.  The book does not cover ALL of Wagner's operas, but the ones omitted (e.g. Rienzi) are minor and I prefer the book's approach to giving more space to the biggies.  I'm sure that some die hard Wagnerians will find this too elementary, but for most of us, it's a great place to start.	2000-11-15

Essentially, it involves Americans perfecting their own country and looking towards their own part of the world as the place they need to be most concerned.  The &quot;new testament&quot; consists of such traditions as containment, expansion and meliorism.  It calls for American to play a much broader role in the world's affairs, although for different reasons.  McDougall does not purport to have written a comprehensive diplomatic history as to explain it and how it might be used to conduct future diplomacy.  &quot;Promised Land&quot; is not highly ideological - some will find his questioning of the Marshall Plan's success and attack on foreign aid infuriating.  Others will be unhappy with his assertion that the US is perhaps well served by its participation in the UN and Nato, as long as the USs ability to act unilaterally when necessary is not impeded.  For example, he points out that Washington's famous injunction was against &quot;entangling alliances&quot; rather than all alliances and that those which serve the US interest without limited its freedom of action are consistent with Washington rather than opposing it.  In perhaps the most interesting &quot;revision&quot; of the entire book, he repudidates the notion that America has ever been an isolationist nation, saying that it really was a concern for our ability to act unilaterally that was at issue and points to a long history of interventionism to protect US interests dating back to Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates.  Finally, the book explains the role of religion in the changing nature of America's policies from that of a promised land where we would lead by example primarily to one where we would be more willing to intervene.	2000-10-31

Then, there's a full synopsis of the opera.  Next is a musical description of the numbers, with a system of noting the highlights to watch out for.  Finally, there's an essay by the author, Covent Garden's Denis Foreman and his rating.<br />There's about five pages or so per opera, with longer ones getting much more (there's a whole introduction to The Ring).  The style is breezy and colloquial.  Foreman writes in a very tongue in cheek way that obviously some people don't get or like.  Still, unless you despise dry English humor, it's a lot of fun.  The synopses can get a little hard to follow with some of Foreman's jokes at times, however.<br />Also, there's a large glossary in back with lengthy dissertations (again, very tongue in cheek), and composer/singer/conductor bios.  All in all a great resource, even if you already have a book of opera synopsis.	2000-09-28

This book is in effect a great &quot;do it yourself&quot; course on opera.<br />The first chapter is a history of opera.  The second discusses the mechanics of opera - the various types of singers and concepts involved in opera.  Next is a chapter on the mechanics of attending an opera, buying tickets, what to beware, etc.<br />The real heart of the book, though, is the eleven chapters covering eleven different operas.  As you progress through them, you learn about new concepts such as the use of music to evoke emotion, french opera, grand opera, etc.  By carefully choosing the sequence, Plotkin is careful to reveal opera's mystery in a way that will bring listeners in rather than turning them off.  Plotkin also suggests a particular recording for each opera as a way of introducing different singers and conductors as well.  In contrast to others, Plotkin uses the entire opera - not merely highlights.<br />As a companion, I'd suggest Denis Foreman's A Night at the Opera, which is a highly informative, although highly opinionated, reference guide to all the major operas.	2000-09-28

Bemis's work, in Nagel's mind, was as good a treatment on the substantive  work and the historical background of his times as we were to get.   Therefore, he focuses on Adams' personality.  I wished that he would have  talked more about the issues of the day and gone into the political  background for Adams' decisions more.  Other than that, it is a very solid  biography of an American statesman who will be more remembered as a great  diplomat and Congressman passionately opposed to slavery than as a  President.	2000-08-17

He touches on the major issues Wilson faced as President of Princton University as well as President of the US  and shows how Wilson's intransigence was evident from early on.   Auchincloss has reviewed the more recent literature as well, and provides  some interesting information as Wilson's health.  As a lawyer, Auchincloss  also provides interesting analysis of the evidence on various issues still  in dispute (was Wilson really signing those documents after he had a stroke  and his wife wouldn't let anyone see him?).  Finally, he produces a nice  little portrait of Wilson's nemesis, Henry Cabot Lodge, as well.  I doubt  that any real student of the Wilson Presidency could learn much in a volume  that barely exceeds 100 pages, but for others who wouldn't mind spending a  couple of hours learning something about Wilson and his presidency, it  serves its purpose admirably.	2000-04-12

Chernow skillfully and entertainingly reveals how bankers have gone from being all powerful &quot;Masters of the  Universe&quot; to much less exalted financial bureaucrats.

She details the constant struggle between Reagan's speechwriters and his policy drones (the NSC  staff is a particular nemesis) to shape the message.  In the end, though,  Reagan's views come across as his own.  It is clear that although he had  speechwriters to help him, he was more highly engaged in the speechwriting  process than some (see &quot;reader from Atlanta&quot;) would have you  believe.  There are also plenty of examples of where Reagan overruled his  timid advisors and spoke out boldly, examples being his Berlin Wall speech  and the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; speech.  Overall, Noonan's memoirs is a  great portrait of some of the pettiness of those who work in government and  will makes you yearn again for a President who was &quot;simple&quot;  enough to know what he believed without needing a pollster to tell him on  every subject from whether to sign a welfare reform bill to where he and  his family should take their summer vacations.	2000-03-22

By telling you about suit construction, Flusser makes it possible to buy good cloths inexpensively by showing you what to look for.

Sadly, this volume does  not make use of the materials being made available from the Soviet and  other archives, which was able to conclusivly answer many questions  previously unresolved (few serious scholars doubt that Alger Hiss was a  Soviet spy or that the Rosenbergs were innocent).  He is agnostic on the  issue of who was to blame for the cold war.  While some may see this as  even handed, it is difficult to sympathize with a man who cannot  distinguish between a nation fighting to keep the world free and one  struggling to spread its tyranny as far as possible.<br />Further, Patterson  unnecessarily reveals his biases against certain historical figures.  He  quotes with approval a &quot;scholarly&quot; statement about the cold,  black Reagan years and errroneously asserts (in his discussion of  Watergate) that Reagan involked executive privilege to hinder the  Iran-Contra investigation (the privilege was never asserted at all).<br />The  book is a comprehensive overview of the period and does present a  compelling thesis - that the progress made during that period engendered  &quot;Grand Expectations&quot; that would lead to problems down the road  when the march towards progress in terms of economics growth, civil rights,  etc. got off track.<br />Still, readers should consult a more authoritative  author to learn about the Cold War, such as John Lewis Gaddis' &quot;We Now  Know&quot; for a more competent and complete examination of Cold War  issues.	1999-12-30

The Gramaphone 2000 is radically different from its predecessors, and entirely for the worst.  First, it has far fewer works than its competitor, the Penguin Guide 2000.  Also, several features from earlier Gramophone  guides have been dropped.  There are no longer &quot;alternative  selections&quot; -- just the 2 or 3 that the Gramophone editors prefer.   So, if you want to know whether a certain recording is a well regarded one,  you're out of luck unless its one of the 2 or 3 Gramophone lists.  So,  there's nothing to help you differentiate most excellent recordings from  the rest (and there are far more than 2-3 excellent recordings of most  classical music peices).  Also, there are no &quot;G&quot; ratings.  In  previous editions, recordings would also be given 1, 2, or 3 &quot;G&quot;s  in order to indicate the level of regard the authors held a good recording  in.  Finally, the &quot;Gramophone 100&quot; listings are gone.  As a final  sad footnote, the &quot;beginner's&quot; library can only be called a joke.	1999-12-27

Although some (see below) apparently cannot deal with the fact that FDR is portrayed as a man rather than a god, the truth is  that Kennedy takes a scholarly, dispassionate look at this period and finds  that some of views need updating (e.g. Hoover was not a &quot;do  nothing&quot; but had philosophical views that kept him from intervening as  FDR did).  This comprehensive volume does NOT portray America as being  perfect.  Kennedy cites in particular the failure of the US to handle the  Japanese with diplomacy, which is interesting although I'm not convinced  that war with the Japanese could have been avoided without paying too high  of a price.  All in all, it will likely be the standard one volume history  of this period for some time to come.	1999-11-30

Even after reading his History of the American People, however, his finest book remains Modern Times.  HOTAP is a comprehensive, one volume US History that is well written and  interesting to read.  Few important things are omitted (e.g. baseball), and  Johnson's perspective as an English historian who has a great respect for  America is an interesting one.  He reminds us of the vital contributions  made by business leaders at the end of the 19th century and debunks the  &quot;Robber Baron&quot; myth, tracing the bogus historiography responsible  for that term.  The book is marred by small factual errors.  A couple  examples are his confusing two confederal generals with the same last name  and his misattribution of the quote: &quot;The American people be  damned&quot; to Commodie Vanderbilt rather than his son.  The next edition  will assuredly correct these, but Johnson should have had the book fact  checked first.  Among Johnson's observations (which have obviously raised  the ire of some readers below) of importance is the impact of religion on  American history.	1999-11-23

It takes the interesting tack of defending him not  only from the left, but also conservatives who thought RR was too soft on  Gorbachev, etc.  As good as it is, D'Souza's RR is nearly perfect.  D'Souza  concedes nothing in this no-hold barred thesis (it is NOT a comprehensive  biograhpy by any means) and that may weaken his points just a little bit,  hence 4 rather than 5 stars...his explanation of why RR is so hated in  academia may help explain the bile of the reviewer from Temple Univ below  who obviously couldn't stand RR.	1999-10-26

His book is enjoyable to read and contains a lot of personal information about RR's pre-presidency  years that I didn't know.  The problem is that Morris did not write the  book he could and should have written - a comprehensive account of the  Reagan presidency that he was allowed to observe first hand.  Further,  Morris has little interest in policy and none of economics.  Two thirds of  the book takes place outside the presidency, which is the reverse of most  presidential bios.  Further, the account during the presidency focuses on  odd choices of topics.  For example, the Geneva Summit and Bitburg are  given extensive coverage.  Reykjavik and the Berlin Wall speech are given  comparably little, even though Morris himself acknowledges their vital  importance.  Morris also makes records some private moments that should not  have been revealed, as they had nothing to do with RR's presidency.  In the  end though, that is what this book is about.  If you're interested in RR  the man, the book is helpful.  If you are interested in the 1980s and the  Reagan presidency, it is significantly weaker.  Highly recommended is  Martin Anderson's Revolution for readers interested in those aspects more  than RR's personality.	1999-10-26

Gordon doesn't do a particularly good job, though, explaining why the National Debt is (or isn't) important.  Also, he seems to confuse the  debt as a blessing when, in fact, he really means (I think) that it was the  assumption of the pre-constitutional debt by the federal government, which  resulted in international financial credibility, that is &quot;Hamilton's  Blessing.&quot;  The credibility, rather than the debt itself, is the  &quot;strategic tool&quot; that Gordon mentions in his conclusion.
