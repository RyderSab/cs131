US	49504205	R2DFEIJP8WNL19	1572930365	583910085	Before the Ring: Questions Worth Asking, Revised edition	Books	4	31	33	N	N	The more questions you ask your mate...	...the better you improve your chances in having a lasting and fulfilling marriage. Isn't this just common sense? Too many people marry one another without REALLY knowing their partner. They don't ask enough questions during their first months of dating. It's just common sense to do so, but many just won't get into that area in detail. This book will help you greatly when it comes to asking the right questions. Many think that if they are in love, get along and have things in common, these are the only things that matters. Little do they realize that things can change after living together under the same roof for years on end. Asking compatibility questions is what's really needed. The only drawback to this book is that it doesn't get into the area of sex questions for men. Nearly all men think sex plays a major role in a healthy relationship, so of course they need to make sure the woman thinks the same thing. AND WILL CONTINUE TO THINK THE SAME THING FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. This book doesn't go there. Neverthelesss, it's still worth reading.

Now of course I don't agree with most of it. I think these two writers were writing this mainly for entertainment purposes only. The back of the cover should be a tip off. Of course not all men are like the ones described in this book. If you believe that and at the same time you are looking for a solid relationship...well, you might as well hang it up. This is for laughs and some insight on what men want and how they think when it comes to sex with women. Yes, sex is important to men, but are all like the ones catagorized here where they would cheat on you for the sake of a quick sex act??? NOPE! The ones who won't have mates who treat them right (in the bedroom). It's up to the women to know what he wants, and then make him happy, as it should be with the man when trying to make his mate happy. A 50/50 relationship! This book is interesting, humorous reading, and yes, some of it is true. I hate to say it, but we men think about the weirdest things when it comes to sex. The chapters on Masturbation & Loaded Vs. Unloaded are true. Just don't take it too seriously. That's just the way we are. Just know that the man who is kept happy at home, is the man who stays home. And, of course, vice versa.   <br />....	2001-05-28

How would all that make you feel??? So why would you do that to him?! Men do not like these rules, for good reason. They want and likes women to show their interest in them. Your interest makes them feel attractive and wanted. They have been saying that for years. All the things men like from you cannot be found in these rules. The only thing I liked about this book is that it tells you not to jump into a relationship so fast, and especially not to jump into the sack with him so fast. Other than that, there's nothing here that men will agree on. What they want and like from you is what counts, not what other women think they want. Here's one thing these authors haven't thought of: Many men are like children, wanting that toy. The more it is denied him, the more he will want it. The same with women. The more you play hard to get, the more he will want you, but it doesn't necessarily mean he wants that serious relationship. He just wants you because he can't have you. What's going to happen if he does get you? What does a child do with a toy after playing with it for so long? That's right Crude analogy? Yes. But that's the way many men are. The Rules gives advice that will backfire in your face. Read the Real Rules, by Barbara DeAngelis instead. That's what wil work with men. <br />Perry Rose Author of I Love You...Will You Marry Me?!	2001-05-25

I have been reading all the negative reviews on this book, and I can't, for the life of me, understand why women would put down advice that men like and want from women. Barbara DeAngelis hit the nail on the head on what men like from women. Isn't that what matters??? Do the things men like and want from you. After all, don't you want him doing the things you like and want from him? When it comes to attracting men, and trying to figure them out, who would you rather listen to, the men, or the women??? Authors like DeAngelis, Tracy Cabot, Margaret Kent and Leil Lowndes are such authors that listen to what men want.   Ignoring and putting down such advice just doesn't make sense. The Real Rules is what will work for you...because it's advice that men agree on. <br />Perry Rose, author of I Love You...Will You Marry Me?!	2001-05-25

I can't get over all the bad reviews on this book! Don't you know that a diet has a lot to do with what goes on in a human body, especially in this area? Doctors have been saying this for years, yet many readers condemn this book because &quot;it's a cookbook.&quot; You are missing the point, and I can only assume you are still having the same problem, because you don't have an open mind about this. This is more than just a cookbook. The author has told her side of the story by relating how she solved her low libido. That's what this book is about. Hello??? There aren't that many women who are willing to do what she has done in order to make their mates happy, and to also make themselves happy. She has done this, in part, by changing her diet and exercising more. She has also pointed out, more than once, that every human body is different, and what may work for her, may not work for you. She has also clearly stated that seeing a doctor is a must. So, for those who disagreed with this book...did you actually read it??? I gave this to a friend of mine who wanted common-sense solutions to her low libido. She changed her diet, started exercising and finally got off her duff to go see a doctor. She got her libido back, in part, because of this book. She likes this book, and it has helped me better understand what women go through, and their solutions for it. My friend's doctor also agreed that having a healthier diet and more exercise can help a low libido greatly. This is a book worth reading. This is one of the books on this subject that I recommend to my customers. I'm Not In The Mood; What Every Woman Should Know About Improving Her Low Libido is another must read.  <br />Perry Rose, author of I love You...Will You Marry Me?!	2001-05-25

This is the kind of advice book that has you shaking your head in agreement, and a few minutes later, you're head would be shaking the other way. This has great advice on how a wife or girlfriend should watch herself when talking to her mate. Too many men have said that \\"she is always nagging, and I'm just tired of it!\\" This book helps you control that, to a point. But, at the same time it takes you back in time when women are supposed to be in a position where the man can do what he wants without the woman saying anything. I know the author doesn't mean for this book to give that kind of advice. Nevertheless, there it is. This is still a good read though. Just ignore the parts that take you back in time. If anything, it helps you see yourself if you are too critical about your mate. This should be part of your library.	2001-05-25

The title is very misleading. It gives way too much commomn sense that a school-yard child knows already. Nice cover, but that's all there is to it. Between the covers are things you already know. For instance: Always be nice to women, talk sexy to them (yeah, okay! try that if you don't have the looks to back it up) and many silly things women would laugh at. Save your money, and move on. This will only hurt your chances, plus your wallet if you shell out money for this. I was annoyed and pi**ed that there was so little here.

I like reading different ideas and suggestions on how to be more successful with the opposite sex. I saw this, and read the description, ect... on it and it looked like a good book. I made a bad choice. First, this little booklet's content offered nothing that a single man can use that is constructive in any shape or form because it doesn't tell what women like from the average, or below-average-looking guy. It doesn't tell how to best approach women for a date. It gives TOO MUCH common sense (I now don't believe everything I read). The main thing coming from this thing is to just ask her, and don't be afraid. I too agree that for many men it involves more than that. Needless to say, this was a waste. It took me about forty five minutes to read this thing. The only thing you will get out of the content is that it's a little bit of a confidence builder. A &quot;little bit,&quot; I said. That's about it. I was very disappointed, and ticked  off once I saw the actual book, or booklet. I like to concentrate on books that actually tell you what women like, and offers more than just a little bit of confidence building. In real life, it takes more than that.	2001-03-28

But, on the other hand, it is filled with fairy tales. Not all men can be successful with beautiful women. It's a bit too unrealistic in many parts of his book. But if you get past all that, you will pick up some pretty good ideas. And it deals with more than meeting women at a nightclub or bar. It can be used anywhere. The part where women give the things they like in a man are also little bit too unrealistic. Not one time did they mention the height and looks of a man. We know that if these so-called &quot;beautiful women&quot; were surveyed on what qualities they look for in a man, these would be two of them. Nevertheless, by pass the fairy tales, and you will still read a damn good book. Perry Rose, author of &quot;Women, Sex And Dating, For The Single Man.&quot;	2001-03-11

Yes, there are some things in here that don't make sense and may seem a bit too forward for shy women, nevertheless, it's what men like, and want from you. That's what counts.

She's not even close. I too wrote a book on how to be more successful with women, and what they want, but I asked the down-to-earth, very cute women instead of the beautiful materialistic and shallow women. If men think all women are like the ones explained in this book, you might as well hang it up. NOT ALL WOMEN ARE SHALLOW AND MATERIALISTIC! It's books like these that brain washes a good many men. I have talked with I don't know how many women on what they want, and nearly all don't fit what is found in this book. The author's thinking is just that...HER THINKING! I have heard it all while doing the research for my book, and one thing I know for sure, and so should you, is that not all women are like the ones portrayed in this book. The only thing I agree with is chapter six; How To Talk To Women. This is a good chapter. Perry Rose, author of Women, Sex And Dating, For The Single Man.	2001-03-11

A lot of it's pages are only half filled  with text, which makes the book maybe only forty pages. You might as well  call it a small guide. Most of the chapters are only one page long. That  should tell you a lot about this worthless book. It tells you absolutely  nothing on what you need to know from a young woman. NOTHING! Save your  money! It took me less than an hour to read this thing, and I quickly  returned this so-called book. Don't be swayed by positive comments on this,  because it will probably be the authors friends.	2000-08-29
