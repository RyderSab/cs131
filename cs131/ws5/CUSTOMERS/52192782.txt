I've purchased all the books and reread most of them.  Since I teach Special Ed at the high school level, I've found that my students  enjoy Harry Potter.  I can actually get them to read the Potter books and \\"get into them.\\" <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book up until the end.  The ending felt artificial and totally unnecessary.  Without spoiling the book for anyone, the death of this character didn't add up to how the character is portrayed in the previous books. <br /> <br />Also, I have a feeling Rowling wants to extend Harry Potter beyond the seven books once promised.  She seems to be sending Harry on an extended quest to pursue Voldemort for maybe ten years. <br /> <br />Although I enjoyed reading about the characters I've grown to love--Harry, Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys--I felt this story was a bit contrived and not up to standard. <br /> <br />Sorry, J.K.	2005-07-19

This book is not meant to be a history of the American Revolution, but a look at the significance of the year 1776 to its final outcome. <br /> <br />David McCullough has the gift of making history come alive.  He thoroughly researches all the main characters and events.  After gathering extensive background, including letters and relevant documents, the story almost tells itself. <br /> <br />We see George Washington, Nathaniel Greene, Henry Knox, Israel Putman (Old Put), as real people, flawed, human, but in the end heroic and essential to the cause of American liberty. <br /> <br />The book 1776 is a great history lesson and excellent read. <br /> <br />	2005-07-14

I've just finished the book.  I also read \\"A National Party No More\\" by the author. In this  book he is much more introspective and less political.  He cares about America deeply. I started voting Republican in 1992 after being a registered Democrat since first voting for Lyndon Johnson.  I find myself in agreement with Zell Miller on many issues.    In this book, Zell does some deeper thinking.  He is older and more religious, dedicating the book to his wife, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.    His thinking on abortion mirrors my own.  After being pro-abortion for many years, I now hate it.  I know that abortion is sometimes necessary in the early stages, but I don't understand the slavish loyalty to this issue coming out of the Democratic Party.  The Democrats won't even budge on infanticide (partial birth abortion).  A society that does not protect its weakest and most vulnerable, is a society that is doomed!      Sen. Miller makes other points about rap music and state-sanctioned homosexual marriage that are also excellent.    Politicians start running for reelection the day after they are elected.  They grovel for money to all the special interest groups, environment, abortion rights, education etc..  He wants to repeal the 17th Amendment which allows for the direct election of two senators from each state.  He believes if Senators were appointed by state legislatures, most of the bribing and cowtowing to special interests by Senators would end. Thus Senators would represent their consituents instead of Washington lobbyists.  I don't know if I agree with this, but it is an interesting point.    There are incidents in the book about the 2004 campaign that were fun to read as Zell barstormed across Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.    Zell Miller is an interesting man, and \\"A Deficit of Decency\\" is a good read!	2005-06-15

Why, in the midst of unprecedented prosperity and health, is Europe committing demographic suicide?   <br /> <br /> <br />George Weigel answers this and other relevant questions in his thought-provoking book, \\"The Cube and the Cathedral.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Weigel also tells us Americans that Europe's future concerns us.  We are not protected by oceans as in centuries past. <br /> <br />Europe is sinking slowly into malaise; its borders are increasingly penetrated by Islamic immigrants, who provide the workforce for Europe's aging population.  These Islamic immigrants become radicalized in the secular societies of France and England.  As one Islamic talk-show caller states, \\"We share their nationality; our religion is our own.\\"   Radical Islam recognizes no law but Shahria.  <br /> <br />The proposed European Union's constitution wants to eliminate all mention of the continents's Christian roots, wiping our 1500 years of Europe's civilization. <br /> <br />Weigel argues that secularlists attempt to eradicate God from the public square in Europe is having disastrous consequences.  Europeans are bored and disengaged from public life.  They have so little faith in the future, they are not reproducing themselves.    <br /> <br />It would be a shame that the sacrifices of thousands of young men who died in the World Wars of the 20th century died for nothing. <br /> <br />The time is now for Europe to halt her descent into cultural oblivion.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-14

As Johnson states, more books have been written about Napoleon than any other historical figure except Jesus Christ. <br /> <br />I had always thought of Napoleon as the brief restorer of France's glory after the devastation of the French Revolution.  Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo ended what would have been France's return to glory.  This books shows that Napoleon's brief reign in France consisted of very thin soup.  Contrary to some of the negative reviews, Johnson doesn't think everything Napoleon did was bad.  He quit persecuting the Catholic Church, restored some order to governing, and did not hold grudges.  He treated the army rather well. <br /> <br />On the other hand, he bankrupted the country with endless military campaigns.  As soon as the money ran out, he would decide to attack another country.  There was no stabilty to the government because it depended financially upon the next military victory which inevitably quit coming.  Napoleon also established a secret police.  Bribery was rampant. <br /> <br />Johnson rightly debunks the past attempts to romantacize Napoleon's relationships with women especially his first wife, Josephine.  There have been entire novels purportingly based upon Napoleon and Josephine's love life.  Very little is known about their actual life together except the bare facts.  <br /> <br />I found this book easy to read and informative.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-27

This book may be the antidote for the sickness that now pervades our society in relationship to sex.  Abortion, sexually tranmitted diseases, divorce, serial monogamous marriages, and  sexual perversions are rampant. <br /> <br />Those of us who are parents and grandparents live in fear that our cherished children and grandchildren will become prey to one or  more of these sicknessness. <br /> <br />American culture has become sex obsessed.   The unhappiness of people increases in direct relationshiip to the \\"sexual enlightenment\\" they have experienced since the 1960's.  Americans have been told that the answer to all of  problems is better sex, guilt-free sex,and  sex with no responsibility.   <br /> <br />Why then has the teen suicide rate increased, why have marriages become more unstable.  It is not because there is a dearth of information.  In fact, there is a dearth of the WRONG kind of information. <br /> <br />Dr. Wetzel, in this timely book sets the record straight. <br /> <br />Sex without responsility and love is bad sex. <br /> <br />Women are hurt the most when either party is used \\"just for sex.\\" <br /> <br />The answer to increased abortions and teen pregnancies is not more availability of abortion services or contraceptives.  The answer is more responsilibity and self discipline in regard to sexual relations. <br /> <br />All of these facts are counter-cultural.  The media sends the messages that say pleasure is the ultimate end of life--that people  have \\"needs\\" and it is essential that they be met. <br /> <br />\\"Sexual Wisdom\\" is wisdom indeed.  What we need is not more and better sex, but more and better love.	2005-03-21

I enjoyed reading \\"Presidential Leadership.\\"     There is a two to five page essay on each of our presidents.  Each essay is written by a different author.  All of this makes for meaty, well-written prose.      My favorite essay is Paul Johnson, the famous British historian on Bill Clinton.  The incident Johnson relates in an Engish pub with Clinton going full steam is priceless.    I also learned much about our more obscure presidents such as Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Benjamin Harrison, and John Tyler.      Although Franklin D. Roosevelt ranked third in the survey, he comes across as not having accomplished very much.      Peggy Noonan does a good job on JFK, describing his charm as well as the astounding amount of medication the man was ingesting.    Calvin Cooldige was more complicated than the image we have been given of him.      Altogether this book is an excellent read and history lesson all in one.	2005-01-17

I've enjoyed Michael Medved since first watching him on Sneak Previews with Jeffrey Lyons.  His movie reviews shone.  He was the one reviewer I trusted to hone in on the artistic as well as the moral merit of any film.    So many coastal elites looked down on those of us primitives out in the hinterland.  Not Michael. He was and is unfailingly respectful of traditional Christian/Catholic/Jewish beliefs.     I mourned when he left Sneak Previews but rejoiced again when Michael turned up as our Cultural Crusader. He had become a talk-show host in Seattle.  I often wondered what road  he took to be where he was.      Michael's life story is told in Right Turns.  His story is remarkable in itself, but his story mirrors so many of our own life stories.  People of my generation grew up with TV, fell in love with the Democratic Party, hated Conservatives and especially selfish Republicans, grew disillusioned by Vietnam.      Belatedly, we discovered our religious roots--ties that many of us had rejected as passe.      Vietnam, the darkest episode in America's history, is a war we could have and should have won.  The so-called peace movement which was in reality a \\"dodge-the-draft\\" movement, emerges from these pages as the destructive, dishonest force that it was.  As soon as the draft was abolished, the \\"peace\\" movement evaporated.    The pervasive anti-Americanism of the institutional Left is is also explained.    How did this former Democratic Operative from Yale end up as  proud husband and father of three, a practicing Orthodox Jew and card-carrying conservative Republican?    \\"Right Turns\\" is a book that informs as it entertains.

Weigel rightly calls this crisis \\"the long Lent.\\"   <br /> <br />I'm 58, a product of 12 years of Catholic education.  I was 18 when the Second Vatican Council commenced.  After that, the Church entered a period of turmoil and change which still resonates today.   <br /> <br />I liked the incense, Latin, and Gregorian Chant of my childhood.  I have come to appreciate being able to more fully participate at services, but still long for the Tridentine Mass. <br /> <br />Weigel identifies the \\"culture of dissent\\" as the principal culprit.  This culture along with poor formation of priest and woefully inept guidance by American bishops have led the Catholic church astray.  The Bishops unwillingness to confront incidents of Sexual misconduct by priests catapulted serious problems into fullblown crisis.   <br /> <br />The author also corrects the common impression that the public has of the sexual abuses as pedophelia.  The vast majority of cases involve priests relationships with teenage boys---in other words homosexuality.   <br /> <br />Weigel's suggestions for true reform in the Catholic Church: <br /> <br />1.  A Return to true Catholic teaching and a rejection of what he calls Catholic Lite. <br /> <br />2.  Better training and selection of priests along with closer pastoral care and guidance from bishops. <br /> <br />3.  A more personal and less managerial style from the Bishops themselves. <br /> <br />The book ends on a hopeful note describing the many young priests who have rededicated themselves to the church and its mission.	2004-12-16

I wish everyone had a chance to experience these books. <br /> <br />\\"An Episode of Sparrows\\" is my favorite book of Miss Godden's. She writes with amazing sensitivity about children -- almost as if she were one of them.  But this is not a children's book.  Rumer Godden understands the passions which drive people.  She has a true author's ability to get beneath the superficiality of people's daily lives and expose their true hopes and fears. <br /> <br />\\"An Epsisode of Sparrows\\" is set in post-war London.  It concerns the plight of Lovejoy Mason, one of the \\"sparrows\\" (slum children on Catford Street) who has been abandoned by her mother; Lovejoy finds solace and escape in planting a garden in that most unexpected of places, Catford Street.  Catford Street is teeming with the raw lives of slum people. <br /> <br />In contrast, Olivia and her sister Angela, elderly spinsters live on the other side of Catford Street--the respectable side.  Olivia especially yearns to experience the joy of being needed. <br /> <br />How these people and other rich characters such as the Irish Malone family and Vincent, the restaurant owner-- interact is wonderful to behold. <br /> <br />I own very few books; this is one of them.

Bill highlights the incredible outpouring of hate in Seattle (Little Beirut), the build-up to the Afganistan and Iraq wars, the Thanksgiving visit to the troops and other significant events.  <br />It was also interesting to read about the Washington Press Core.  Without being overtly negative, Bill shows their preening and obnoxiousness, the jockeying for position, and the twisted news coverage of this president and his administration.

Hillenbrand is meticuous in describing the economic and historical conditions surrounding the circumstances in which Seabiscuit came to prominence.  She is especially good bringing the reader into the world of horses through the eyes of the jockeys, stable boys, trainers, and reporters.  <br />After listening to this entire book in CD form I am well satisfied.

I can identify with Zel Miller.  My background as the daughter of Irish and Russian Jewish immigrants made me a Democrat by default. The great Democratic Party of the nineteenth and early twentieth centures gave hope to the poor.  I use the past tense because I vote Republican now.  <br />Senator Miller is a loyal Democrat in spite of some of the reviews on Amazon.  He believes in government helping the people in the best sense of Jeffersonian democracy.  His family have been loyal Democrats since the middle of the nineteenth century.  He doesn't recognize present day Democrats as the party of his forbears, and neither do I.<br />The Democratic Party at the federal level is the slave of special interest groups especially the abortion lobby.  In spite of rhetoric to the contrary, all the judicial nominees who are well qualified in every sense have been voted down by unconstitutional filibuster because of their perceived opposition to Roe vs. Wade.<br />Two other high powered lobby groups are the education lobby and the enviromental lobby.  The NEA opposes vouchers.  As a result, millions of inner city blacks and hispanics are trapped in decaying schools with inferior teachers and curriculum.  The Democratic Party used to boast it defended the defenseless and the oppressed.  Tell that to the kids who are being denied a quality education by their elected Democratic representatives.<br />One little area in Alaska, ANWAR, cannot be drilled for oil because the Sierra Club and others oppose us.  Gas prices go up for Joe Sixpack because of the Democrats and leave our country dependent upon foreign oil.<br />Zel Miller is not so much a conservative as a traditionalist.  His experience in Washington has filled him with disgust at his own party which has abandoned the Red States--states that include the South and most of the Midwest.<br />It would be nice if the Democrats would listen to one of their own before it is too late. I don't see that happening soon.  Tom <BR>Daschle,Ted Kennedy, Chuck Schumer et al. are living in their dream world where Republicans play golf and are rich and evil.  They play the class warfare game, the racial game, the abortion card, and we are all the losers.<br />Zel Miller points out that John F. Kennedy was strong on defense and lowered taxes.  John F. Kennedy also carred the South.  <br />No Democrat is going to carry one Southern state in 2004.<br />A National Party No More!	2004-02-02

Peter Robinson explains why this deceptively simple man is one of our greatest presidents.  <br />Reagan's ability to communicate with the public, hold to his conservative ideals, deal with subordinates, delegate authority and change history are explained clearly.  <br />Most famous and powerful men do not make good family men.  Reagan was no exception.  Robinson allows how Reagan could have been a better father.  But Reagan also had the qualities that make for greatness.  He never lost sight of his ideals.  He dealt with people in every station of life fairly and equally. Reagan's optimism comes through here and his dedication to hard work.   <br />Ronald Reagan truly believed in the power of the individual.  He rejuvenated conservativism when it was at its low point.<br />Above all President Reagan believed in America--her goodness and essential decency--two qualities that this man possessed in abundance.<br />Peter Robinson explains why Reagan changed his life.

Born Fundamentalist-Born Again Catholic takes on the major issues of Authority, Salvation, Mary, and The Rapture among others.  David Currie explains them in a lucid, well-researched, and scriptural manner. <br />It took tremendous courage for David Currie to leave a fundamentalist Baptist background, with a minister father and many Baptist relatives and friends.  He did it because he is a reader and a seeker-of-truth.  He could not ignore the call of is heart.<br />He never denigrates his former church or any of the people in it,writing with love of his own journey into the Catholic Church. He still regards his former Baptist congregation as brothers and sisters in Christ.  <br />Having attended a Baptist church for a year, I know how much courage this took.  Catholics are regarded by fundamentalist Baptists as unsaved, little better than heathens.

He found out that life is not that simple.  His search for the truth led him to Catholicism.  It was not an easy journey.	2003-07-18

It depicts Paul McCleod dealing with the death of his longtime wife, Maureen, their relationship on a Scottish breeding farm and Paul and Maureen's three sons--Fenno, and twins Dennis and David. If the quality of that writing had continued, \\"Three Junes,\\" would have been a great book. Sadly, this is not the case. The middle section, \\"Upright,\\" dealing with eldest son, Fenno McCleod is too long, and ultimately uninteresting. The last section, \\"Boys,\\" is better, but unsatisfying because the middle section has failed to fulfill the promise of the first.<br />Julia Glass shows great promise as a writer. Hopefully, she will continue to improve her craft and offer us more selections in the future.	2003-05-25

I found this book fascinating, beautiful, and moving. Mr. Birzer has done a credible job of analyzing and interpreting \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and The \\"Simarillion\\" for those of us interested in Tolkien's writings. The reader leaves Sanctifying Myth with a better understanding of the main characters--specifically Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Faramir, and Aragorn. <br />I especially liked the depiction of Sam Gangee as the true hero of \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Frodo is important, of course, but he remains somewhat in the abstract as \\"The Ringbearer\\" or \\"The Hero on a Great Quest.\\" I instinctively liked Sam and admired the qualities of loyalty, honesty, common sense, and affectionate humor which Sam displayed throughout all three parts of LOTR.<br />Gandalf is also explained very well as the saintly emissary of Eru/Iluvatar/God-a Christlike figure \\"dying\\" and coming back to life to serve Middle Earth with new powers.<br />I think Tolkien's Sanctifying Myth is profound and very relevant to our time of secularism, Islamic Jihad, moral distintegration, and crumbling traditional morals.<br />I hope everyone gets a chance to read this book.	2003-05-18

As a teenager in the early 60's, I slogged through The Lord of the Rings, realizing its worth but never fully understanding the background of the epic work.  The recent success of the motion picture, The Two Towers, has reinvigorated my interest in all things Tolkien.  I read the Simarillion and am now in the midst of this fascinating compilation of Tolkien's letters.<br />I highly recommend this book to readers of The Lord of the Rings.  It brings to light the background and philosophy behind Tolkien's writing.  <br />Thank God Tolkien was such a prodigious letter writer.  We are all the beneficiaries of his correspondence with family, friends such as C.S. Lewis, fans, and critics alike.	2003-02-24

And infidels are anyone who is NOT a Muslim.<br />That is why democracy has failed to take hold in all Muslim countries except Turkey.  There is no separation of church and state in Islam.  That idea is foreign to them.  All states must be theocratic states based upon the principles in the Koran.  <br />Yes, I have heard the argument that all religions have histories of violence against others, but ONLY Islam specifically encourages and exhortates its followers to kill, yes kill, infidels.  If a Christian persecutes those who are not Christian, he does so against the conscripts of his faith and is condemned by other Christians.  <br />That is why we heard so few Imans condemn the September 11 bombings.  Even though they may have regretted what happened, they know that the terrorists have the Koran to back them up.<br />We are dealing with a fanatic and well-funded foe who is committed to kill every man, woman, and child in this country.<br />We had better face up to facts and protect ourselves.	2003-01-11

Mrs. Bush hosted a symposium dedicated to \\"Women Authors of the American West.\\"  One of these authors was Willa Cather.<br />I remember reading Cather in high school in the early 1960's and realizing she had a classical sytle.  What a pleasure it was to pick up this book and rediscover her again.<br />\\"Oh Pioneers\\" has the simplicity and beauty of the Nebraska plains it so well describes.  The herione, Alexandra Bergon is as wholesome, strong, and simple as Nebraska wheat.  <br />Written in the days before television, video games, and the many corrupting factors of modern culture, this book is a hymn to the  virtues of the pioneers who built our country.<br />\\"Oh Pioneers is not a sanguine novel.  There is death, drought, sickness, and thwarted love.  But, utltimately there is also human triumph and hope embodied in Alexandra.  She faces life with courage, dignity, and compassion.<br />\\"Oh Pioneers\\" speaks to the heart.  I highly recommend it.	2002-12-20

Pulitzer prize winner David McCullough has the gift of writing good history that reads like an exciting novel.  This biography of John Adams made me appreciate the founding fathers of our country.  Theirs was not an easy task.  Forging our young American republic took intellectual and moral stamina.  John Adams had both.<br />While the book emphasizes John, it cannot ignore Abigail who was an essential part of John Adam's success.  The two maintained an extensive correspondence which gives us a glimpse into their marriage and into the issues of the day.<br />Thomas Jefferson comes off in these pages as brilliant but somewhat hypocritical.   He was against slavery but owned slaves.  He preached economy but was a hopeless spendthrift.<BR>The friendship between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson was complicated and devoted.<br />I'm glad I read this book and recommend it without qualification.	2002-08-10

He was a simple, direct, optimistic person whose decision to enter politics after a career as a movie actor was supremely lucky for America.<br />Reagan changed the course of American history.  He stopped creeping socialism in its tracks and began the modern American conservative movement.  He showed what one man without fear, with the courage of his convictions, unbounded optimism, and belief in  American ideals could do.<br />He was a man of low ego, not afraid to delegate, possessed with a sense of humor and a belief in the rightness of American ideals right down to faith in God, freedom, and the value of the individual.  He was corny sometimes but shrewd politically.  He never allowed the leftist press or the intelligensia to thwart him.  He went right over their heads and communicated directly to the American people.  He remained popular throughout his two terms.<br />To me, a former Democrat who didn't vote for a Republican until Bill Clinton, this book was a reaffrimation of my decision to be a conservative.  <br />Like Reagan, &quot;When Character Was King,&quot; is unabashadly patriotic, loving, and deceptively simple.  Ronald Reagan was not a stupid man who spent his presidency napping.  He alone is responsible for the collaspe of the Soviet Union.  <br />This book is a loving memoir to a man who is right up there with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as one of our greatest presidents!	2002-01-06

Cronin since I was a teenager in the early 1960's.  He was an author who knew the meaning of his craft.  Starting with Hatter's Castle in the early 1930's and concluding many books later in the 1970's, Cronin just kept improving and expanding as a writer.<br />  The Keys to the Kingdom is one of my favorites of his works.  It is the story of Francis Chisholm, son of Alec Chisholm a Catholic in Presbyterian Scotland.  Francis is orphaned at a young age when his father and mother are killed in a wave of anti-Catholicism. After his boyhood love commits suicide, young Francis decides to be a priest.<br />  His vocation is an example of humility, love, compassion and tolerance--virtues which are contrasted with the worldliness and superficiality of the ambitious clergyman, Anselm Mealy. Cronin  is a master at portraying the character of Scottish people whom he loves in spite of his succint insight and commentary on their faults and foibles.<br />I highly recommend this book to those who want to know more about Catholicism at its best.	2001-12-07

I have Heard Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson described as a &quot;propaganda novel.&quot;  That it well may have been in its day.  But &quot;Ramona&quot; has not endured all these years because of a propaganda message.  This novel has endured because of the trueness of the characters--The noble Alessandro, the patient, tender Ramona, the faithful Felipe, the just, stern, sad  Senora Moreno.<br />Even the minor characters are true to form especially the jealous, vindictive Margarita, the loyal Marta, and the strutting but endearing Juan Can.<br />I rediscovered this book in a dusty corner of our public library and devoured in in two days.<br />A book becomes a classic when it becomes part of your soul.  The love story of Ramona and Alessandro has burned itself into my heart where it will remain forever.	2001-07-27

I laughed sometimes and wept at others.  <br />Cahill fleshed out the historical and religious figures of Paul, Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John.

Although Kevin Aucoin is an unaparalleld make-up artist, I was disappointed in the lack of practical hints and techniques for the average person in this coffee table book.  Another irritation is the refusal to give name brands for the various foundations, mascaras, blushes, and liptsticks used.  The excuse that Kevin gives that, \\"they may be out of use in three months\\" just doesn't fly.  The real reason is based on the $(dollar) sign--Revlon, Chanel, Arden,  Estee Lauder et al. may not hire Mr. Aucoin if he recommends one brand over another.  This is not helpful to the reader who has no idea what a \\"reddish-brown cream blush\\" or a \\"light beige lipstick\\" is.<br /><br />That being said, the makeovers  of stars and every day people are amazing.	2000-10-31

In this book she exposes the cruel lie told to modern young women --namely that they must be  &quot;just like men, have many lovers, lose their virginity, give up  modesty, and get over it.&quot;  Loss of innocence has been made into a  virtue by our culture with disasterous results.  Anorexia, bulimia, self  mutiliation are the results of young girls being made to feel they are  worthless sex objects.<br />Radical feminism has been no friend to modern  woman.  Radical feminism's idea of freedom has led to women's unhappiness  in a world where she is not respected and made to feel left out and  &quot;weird&quot; if she chooses not to take part in the sex roulette  game.<br />As Marmie says in LITTLE WOMEN, &quot;To be loved by a good man is  the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman; and I sincerely  hope my girls may know this beautiful experience.&quot; Too many women in  our modern culture have been denied this experience.<br /> A RETURN TO  MODESTY: DISCOVERING THE LOST VIRTUE shows how we can begin a new sexual  revolution and regain the happiness and self respect due us as daughters of  God.	2000-08-14

Frederick Hayek's masterpiece, unappreciated in 1944, stands the test of time.  His premise that central planning destroys liberty of thought as  well as body has proved true as evidenced by the collapse of the Soviet  Union, and the economic and cultural devastation of such countries as Cuba  and North Korea.<br />In attempting to correct injustices  in the economic  life of people, the central planners eventually control all facets of  people's lives including education, civil service, medicine, and industry.  It is bureaucrats in the central government who decide who is to get a job,  what that person is to be paid, how that person is to be promoted, and what  kind of lodging that person is to have instead of the free market.<br />Highly recommended!	2000-08-06
