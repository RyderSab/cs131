Instead, there is this incredible creative<BR>genius that makes me sure he will not be a one-hit wonder.<br />In Everything Is Illuminated, the narrator is not a very <BR>coherent source of information at the beginning.

The other one is liberty falling, and though the entire world appears to find that to be her best work, i would give that one only three stars and i am giving this one five stars.<br />It's not that she does anything so out of the ordinary for a mystery novel as to make you go, Wow! . . . but she does know her locale well enough to leave you feeling you know it just a little too, and that is a hard thing to manage in a simple little genre thriller. I give Barr high marks for depth of character, and of course it is easier with a serialized one like this. But it's never boring or tired.<br />If you like murder mysteries, or if you like outdoorsy stories and aren't sure if Barr is right for you, this is a good Barr book to start off with, I think.	2002-09-24

Well, it means I had to figure out what to keep and what to throw. (Ok, not THROW, but what to sell, give away, and lend out indefinitely... and throw). Guess where this book went? Into the FREE PLEASE TAKE ME pile at the mailroom at work, that's where.<br />Look, Moody is gifted. He's just not as gifted as he thinks he is. It's a shame his only tools are Faulkneresque sentences and brooding overture. If he could plot a little, he be a durn genius. But with Moody, it ain't about the story. It ain't about the characters. As with all the guys in his little club, he's got The Disease. The disease of expositional overload. And the book suffers greatly for it.<br />The movie is actually better than the book, for once.<br />In the movie, each of the children actually feel like something other than cardboard cutouts --- it's as if Charles Schulz  took his Peanuts gang and gave them the same free reign as with Chuck, Linus, etc. and installed an even more free 1970s style unsupervised environment that puts the whole gang in overdrive (from many forms of not-quite-harmless stimulation). In the movie, the adults are cardboard cutouts, as the novel clearly indicates them to be, and there is an optimism about the world that we can have that maybe it won't have to be like this for all generations. Yet in the book, the overarching theme is that we are never going to reclaim Peanuts-land gentility and carefreeness. I don't care if Moody is right or wrong (but he did not convince me), but upon re-reading the book did not make me feel like Moody had encompassed his subject any better than the first time I read it. The expositional blockage is still in the way.	2002-09-24

This much is true: Anyone expecting a lot of information about The Man Himself should be a little disappointed. The book bills itself as granting more info than it does. I suspect this is out of Rubin's own deferrence to Murakami's privacy. He treads delicately on the info of the author's life in the biographical sections and when we do get a smattering of Murakami's own words about himself (and it's rare), it feels like nuggets culled from stray emails rather than from a sustained closeness of the translator to his author-friend. That's a shame, but it doesn't mar the book, which is a real resource for English readers without a real roadmap of his lesser works. Knowing which stories I need to seek out is so much easier, and understanding the significance of Murakami's first two novels is much better illuminated than before-- given their basic unavailability in print in English.<br />For me, Rubin's translations are my favorites. I simply have to disagree with the reader from the dolphin hotel. The touch that Rubin gives to his translations is very delicate and appreciated. I too have had a chance to peruse Binrbaum's NW translation, and although I can't find it directly lacking in any way, I simply prefer the Rubin version.<br />I really wish Rubin had gone a lot further into understanding what it takes to translate Murakami. This is the area in which he has very unique knowledge compared to the rest of us and he only rarely tells us much about it. Sure, there is a subtext in this book about what it is like to translate certain things, but it was not enough.<br />I rec this book highly to any Murakami fan, especially those that liked HBW&amp;TEOTW and TWUBC --- Rubin dwells on these books plenty (in addition to NW, which sort of goes without saying ... if not for re-translating NW, Rubin would not have the credibility to get this book into print). This volume may have its flaws, but I think a career summary of HM comes at the right time, and Rubin is a good man for the job.	2002-09-24

But this book dwelled too often on<BR>material aimed at disgusting the reader merely for effect. There<BR>wasn't enough substance behind the writerly trick for it to stick<BR>to me. The better parts of the book are actually the creepy,<BR>non-disgusting ones, in which we are simply living in the skin<BR>of a character we know is a sleazebag. To have set him up and<BR>portrayed him as a sleazebag really didn't require Homes to go<BR>imitating Bret Easton Ellis. In fact, at times the really ooky<BR>child molester parts just feel like knockoffs on an established<BR>style that surely played well at some writer's roundtable... not <BR>*cheap* knockoffs, mind you, but still knockoffs.<br />Music for Torching is by far a better work for Homes: more<BR>insightful, observant, and ultimately more cathartic, confusing,<BR>and troubling about society. That sounds strange, given<BR>the subject matter of End of Alice... but Homes doesn't get extra<BR>credit from me just for choosing a difficult piece of subject<BR>matter.

This book *should* simultaneously: (1) serve the gourmet community in providing some recipes grouped along less-than-traditional lines, (2) provide lay-explanations for real kitchen dummies of some interesting science that goes on in the art cooking, and (3) provide an interesting new spin for those people that know a lot about cooking, but really still aren't gourmet chefs. He doesn't quite succeed, except for goal (1).<br />The book people must have loved him when he walked in with this manuscript, since it really only consists of 70 or so pages of real text about &quot;food science&quot; to edit, and can still be marketed in a neat niche that will disguise the kind of book it really is. I agree with the above reviewer who noted that of 100+ recipes, maybe only a dozen make me stand up and listen. The only conclusion I can draw is that just like other haute cuisine/california cuisine books, this one has that special disease which comes from the author living in another world from my own in terms of the time, and expense of gathering ingredients and preparation.<br />I wish he'd had more chapters and more text concerning kitchen science. At least 50% of the information will be old to a seasoned home cook, even if it is written well in many spots. The instructive recipes could have been trimmed to take up 50 pages/recipes, and the Bill Nye science act could have taken up 120-150 pages over 8-10 chapters instead of the 6 themes he stuck with.

This is a future in which quite a lot of information that we consider common sense has gone missing. Especially so for women, and in any case it reminds me of a Bradbury story which articulated much of this theme in an embarrassingly small amount of space compared to the first third of this book. Unfortunately, this is also the best third of the book, and Stephenson's punchy humorous bits can't rescue the book later on where it needed editing. The parallel story lines approach that he used to much effect in Cryptonomicon doesn't work as well here. Tip: if you write a book with parallel story lines, make sure they are fairly equally interesting or else people will start only caring about one of those lines and then, well, you're crippling yourself. cf- The Grapes of Wrath for a &quot;how to do it right&quot; tutorial.	2001-06-20

Like many people I wanted this book to succeed so I could point to a mainstream writer (who rocks at what he does best, mystery) that has big ideas about SF. Well, Mosley does have ideas, but the book does not deliver. Rather than blend the mystery and SF genres so much, what Mosley has decided to do, more or less, is create a book that raises big questions about race in the future of this country. This would also be pretty darn great if it succeeded too, but... While the future is a frequent realm of SF, Mosley has dealt a book that feels like it was written on a bet to see if he could get a publisher to buy an SF novel from a mystery star. Hmm.<br />Unlike some of the better works of Delany, Butler, and newer young black SF writers, Mosley's approach lacks a critical understanding of what makes an SF novel a philosophical novel (and quite unfortunately, this is exactly what he wants it to be, very very badly). Rather than unfold the whole plot for you to explain what I mean, I will let Mosley fans and SF read it on their own to decide if they agree.<br />If you are interested in these issues (race in SF)- check out  &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, an anthology of African-American SF stories. There are some stories in there which top the effect of this book in a much smaller space.	2001-06-20

Structured as a set of three closely tied &quot;what-if&quot; novelettes which all use the same characters and same protagonist to examine a particular woman's midlife, Anshaw hits the nail on the head again and again. You will not read many novels concerning sexual ambiguity that are as good as this one. And yet the book is about so much else that I feel unfair in pigeonholing it to some kind of &quot;bi-girl&quot; subgenre. <br />Even though the writing feels light in many places, the effect slowly starts to pile up in heavier and heavier subtexts until it will have knocked you flat by the end, trust me.	2001-06-20

BUY IT.<br />I can also offer some side advice for specific genre lovers: The mystery side of this is good, but if you are strict mystery buff, this book will be enjoyable but may not knock your socks right off. It stands as a perfectly middle of the road mystery on its own right.<br />Lethem lovers will adore this book for its use of language and odd pace, that moves along in the frame of Lionel, the Touretic hero. This is his strongest book yet, and shows Lethem's true range. If you are a fan of his early work, particularly the harder SF stuff, don't be discouraged-- although less murky and mysterious, this book is so offbeat, the language-warping is so charming, and the protagonist so different, you can't help but be sucked in.<br />Book lovers in general should find this book unusual, but extremely readable. If you are unfamiliar with Lethem, and unsure if this is for you, then at least be aware this is probably your best &quot;entry&quot; to his non-science-fiction works.

(* OWG = Old White Guys, e.g. Roth, Mailer, Updike, Cheever, Irving). Roth's modus operandi appears to be understanding the politics of revenge, sort of (you get the feeling that reviewer-author relationships were in his mind when he wrote it). In a twist not far off from Martin Amis' (or Kingsley, take your pick) academic foible novels, Roth tracks the disintigration of one man's life at a ripe old age. Less stupid than &quot;A Man in Full&quot; (but more stupid by far than something like &quot;Independence Day&quot;), Roth succeeds in picking away at human pettiness. Along the way, he manages some choice intersections of various corners of culture (white trash, academia, blacks, jews, etc.) with each other. This aspect could have been dealt with in a whole separate novel, with room to spare.	2001-06-20

After a long series of novels all over the map, he still doesn't get the kind of play that you might think he would. I think that has to do with his SF beginnings, and the bias here against writers who've come out of that mold, regardless of the subjects they chose. And in &quot;The Business&quot; he sets his sights on another genrified topic- the big international conspiracy consortium. This choice is his unfortunate mistake, because he nevers gets ahead of the game in subverting this tried and true form.<br />While Banks attempts in many ways to improve on the likes of Robert Ludlum, this book becomes another one of its type. The flair that it does show is in the narative. The female lead has a good strong voice. This is swallowed up by the subject matter, though. The plot is not so ho hum as I make it sound- but I felt that someone as accomplished of Banks would break the shackles of the page-turner form with this.

It's really what Carroll does with images, dreamscapes, magical occurrences, and supernatural \\"special effects\\" that make the difference in this book. Like a Murakami book, or a Borges story, nothing really \\"happens\\" to the protagonist, who appears caught in a Kafkaesque metamorphin' type of trap involving a dog, a missing couple, an old friend, and the righting of the past and future (and so on and so on). The changes of scenery and swappable dreamscapes continue to appear late into the book, and wear on to the point where you aren't sure Carroll can resolve it satisfactorily. I won't tell you how he does, but it was good enough for me. So why four stars?<br />At first I couldn't figure out what kept me from giving this the benefit of the doubt- why it can't quite capture a full rating from me. Trouble is, the characters aren't all that likeable. I know that is meant to be part of the charm, what with a Scrooge type of plot (this is a very loose interpretation). But Carroll never seemed to concentrate on getting me to feel that the beleagured hero was someone to empathize with. I never got the ring of indignation at seeing his failed attempts to figure out the plot.	2001-06-20

I had had this book suggested so many times. So when I finally got around to reading it, I was set up for disappointment and didn't finish it, not enjoying it at all. So when I came back to it much later and decided to give it another chance, I hoped for a turnaround. Not to be. Vinge is a smart smart guy, and clever. He builds some great threads into this book, which has been aptly described as space opera. I was looking for more of a philosophical bent, I guess. It's not that I wanted the book to be more serious - - I just kept getting the feeling that Vinge's tendencies for fairly traditional SF space-y tropes don't fit my liking. This didn't live up in the face of the likes of Bester or Haldeman (or even Heinlein, yikes), which is where I'd turn if I were you.	2001-06-20

Compared to the Sheep books, Norwegian Wood, and Wind-Up Bird this is lightweight. I didn't get the sense of &quot;all is not right in the world&quot; that I usually get from a Murakami book. This is not to say it is a bad book. Just for HM, it isn't his best.	2001-05-15

Depending on how much modern fiction you've read, this book will either seem (1) very simple, but well-told, (2) surprising, groundbreaking, and really cool, or (3) subversively seductive. I've loaned my copy out to a number of people, and it is amazing the range of responses. Especially so compared to the wow-factor that the critics appeared to award this book when it first came out.	2001-05-15

That said, the ending is strained, the characters are jokey, and the anti-corporate message is played too close to the bone. These are, in fact, also the exact things which make the book endearing. If you like his attitude, you might check his website, chock full of cool stuff: [...]   If you can get ahold of his self-published novel, &quot;Angry Young Spaceman&quot; you will also enjoy that. It is more Sci-Fi than this one, really, and at its heart a reasonable story about culture clashes, dressed up a little in Munroe style.	2001-05-15

Frequent readers of his work will spot some familiar elements, yet I think he manages to avoid being caught in that trap of a middle aged writer unable to produce a new idea. Even if his characters' stuggles with love and life has played out before, this is a writer that just puts it on the page better than almost any other. Closest in feel to &quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot;, but I liked this one more than that one.	2001-05-15

Murakami's literary love lives are as strange as they come. In a vain search to find a glimpse of a woman he'd known before, Murakami plows the depths of the protagonist's pysche. The clarity and disclarity of his writing never ceases to amaze.	2001-05-15

In a style most like the Sheep novels by the same author, this one almost seems to slip out of control late in the action, but manages to tidy up better than I expected in the end.

He knew how to evoke dread. And he knew how to tell a story of the sea. It's not as involved or incredible as Heart of Darkness (but few things written in the English language have ever been)-- this little story about a stowaway is tightly told.

An antidote to selfish 30-something serial dating creature of habit lifestyles, learning to become a human being? Not really. Actually the characterizations are slightly too thin early on for me to take Hornby's motives seriously, and it eventually makes it impossible for him to make his point because he's too interested in appearing funny and setting up the farce side of the equation to completely nail the bonding/growing up side of things. A shame, because he had all the trappings available, and certainly has the talent.	2001-04-02

You will laugh out loud at points, and while the movie desperately tries to capture some of that, it can't quite get the range of emotion involved in the book. Plus you will have different feelings about having identified with this guy that has such a twisted brain when you are reading it as opposed to watching it. Ellis is certainly a creative and nutty genius. You can claim that he has run out of steam after his early breaks, but at least stop and savor this book for what it is, and enjoy the maniacal rantings that it contains.	2001-04-02

But the Sheep Novels and Norwegian Wood are better at getting to bottom of that emotion than this slim novel.

But don't let that scare you, this book should not fall through the cracks! It delivers an odd tale about a disorganized band of misfits lumbering through an almost unrecognizable landscape which is still strangely familiar. If that sentence describes the kind of fiction you like to read, grab this book, and you won't be disappointed. There is plenty of symbolism, shades of Kafka, Borges, Calvino, etc., and the prose is very smooth. No doubt you'll be looking forward to more Lethem quite soon after finishing. The ending will likely leave you perplexed and thinking. (ps- I maintain a Lethem website-- take a look	2001-03-26

It will appeal to anyone with an inkling of interest in fantasy/sf, literary fiction, or African-American writing. Frankly, I can't imagine many people who are serious about reading contemporary fiction that would not love this volume. My personal favorites out of this were Schuyler's story about a machine that can make people white, Steve Barnes neo-holocaust story of love, sacrifices, loss, and the human spirit, and the work of the incredible up-and-coming Nalo Hopkinson.	2001-01-11
