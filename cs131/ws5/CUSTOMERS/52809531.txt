While completing my MBA at NYU's Stern School of Business, I accepted a graduate internship with Deloitte Consulting's thought-leadership group, Deloitte Research.  The group fell under the leadership of author Keith Ferrazzi who was serving as Deloitte's chief marketing officer.   While I had lost touch with Keith over the years (clearly violating one of his central tenants), I have followed his career at Starwood, YaYa, and, eventually, Ferrazzi Greenlight through the media.   With a little effort (and luck), I was fortunate enough to obtain an advance copy of his book which I quickly read and have, hopefully, taken to heart.   <br /> <br />\\"Never Eat Alone\\" is a terrific guide to building and nurturing value-added relationships.  The book combines tangible suggestions for improvement with reinforcing and inspirational stories of Keith's own experiences.   As a member of Keith's team, I had the opportunity to closely observe his marketing and brand management principles as he applied them to both Deloitte and himself.   In fact, on several occasions, Keith had me prepare 1-2 page briefings on many of the people and companies he met with during his time at DC - an activity that is an important part of his relationship building strategy as outlined within his book, \\"Never Eat Alone.\\"  As a result of this experience and having read his book, I recognize the importance and impact of Keith's advice.  In several respects, it is much better than many of the highly acclaimed networking and relationship books such as Harvey Mackay's fine \\"Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty.\\"  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in discovering the power of relationships.  Overall rating: \\"A.\\" <br />	2005-02-22

It typically takes a credit or corporate banking professional several years and several levels (analyst, senior analyst, associate/assistant vice president, and finally, vice president) to piece together the knowledge and analytical skills presented within this wonderful book.   The book offers a comprehensive foundation in business, financial, and strategic analysis (among several other related topics) in a very easily digested and understood manner.   I guess my only complaint is that I didn't have the opportunity to write it myself!!  I would advise every credit or relationship management team leader to purchase this book for their entire team -- particularly for their analysts and associates (although... on second thought, perhaps everyone on the team should have a copy in their desk drawer.)  Bottom line:  Highly-recommended.  AAA+++	2005-01-23

Books	5	11	11	N	N	One of The Most Important Books in My Construction Library	This is easily one of the most important books in my construction library.  The book has been updated and the pictures, tables, and illustrations are crystal clear.  The book takes the guesswork out of complex miters for baseboard, chair rails, crown molding, and other trim projects.  I plan on ordering some of the author's other products such as the laminated charts, molding templates, and perhaps one or two of the True Angel tools.  I'll attach the laminated charts and molding templates directly to the miter saw and portable stand... right where I need them.  As a decorating contractor, complex miters are a daily headache.  Incorrect angles result in excess waste materials and labor every time we have to redo a section of trim.  The book makes cutting complex miters easy (easier?) for all my crew -- master and apprentice carpenters alike.  Overall grade: AAA+++	2004-05-10

The books principles can be summarized by Mr. Harding's acronym &quot;BEST.&quot;<br />(1) Buyers.  Identify the key buyers in the client organization and strive to create relationships with as many -- if not all -- of these buyers as possible.<BR>(2) Events.  Create &quot;events&quot; such as kick-off meetings, progress meetings, and fact-finding/exporatory meetings that put you in a position to build these relationships and mine for signals (number #3 which follows) of additional needs or concerns.<BR>(3) Signals.  Listen for signals that the client may need additional services.  These signals may be obvious (such as the announcement of a merger or acquisition) or may be simple comments.<BR>(4) Techniques.  Professionals should equip themselves with listening, relationship-building, and sales skills in addition to professional skills and expertise.<br />The book provides extensive case studies to show each principle in detail and also provides a representative list of the types of events and signals to consider.  Again, this book is by far the best available on cross selling.  I highly recommend it.	2003-08-27

Other reviewers have noted various errors in the book.  I'll add my two cents worth on this topic as well: on page #99 and #100 of the book Mr. Newell attempts to explain Stern Stewart &amp; Company's EVA (Economic Value Added) equation.  I have no idea where he came up with his definition and calculation, but it is absolutely wrong.  First, EVA does not use the dividend rate to compute the cost of equity (in fact, I don't know of anyone who uses the &quot;dividend discount&quot; model to compute equity costs).  Secondly, he completely ignores the after-tax rate of debt to calculate the cost of capital.  I can go on-and-on about the oversights and weaknesses of his EVA discussion; however, in combination with the other errors and ommissions mentioned by a number of other reviewers, I'd say there is more than enough reason to take a &quot;pass&quot; on this book.

This book is really good for you... just like eating your vegatables.  Unfortunately, its not easily digested.  This book provides a great method of preparing strategic proposals.  The method is largely based on the Mento &quot;Pyramid Principle&quot; a book which is itself not an easy read (however, it is required reading at McKinsey, BCG, and other major strategy consulting firms.  This fact should tell you instantly just how powerful a concept it is).  However, if you're willing to hold your nose and chew slowly (I'm not willing to give up on the &quot;eat your vegatables&quot; analogy just yet), you and your proposals will be much more competitive.  Since the book is far from an easy read, I'd suggest that you tackle it chapter-by-chapter with some time for rest and contemplation in between (divide it into &quot;bite-sized&quot; pieces, in other words).  If you're looking for fast-food proposal fair, I'd like to suggest Robert Kantin's &quot;Proposal Kit For Dummies&quot; which, despite the title, is a terrific book on proposal writing for professionals -- particularly consultants.

Anthony's \\"Selling to VITO\\" is one of the best books ever written for people selling big ticket products and services to senior executives.  So I had high expectations for his latest book, \\"Secrets of VITO.\\"  Unfortunately, the book is little more than pop-psychology.  Consider the following seven of Anthony's ten golden rules:<br />(1) I will be honest, even when it hurts.<BR>(2) I will touch people in a special way.<BR>(3) I will keep my thoughts and ideas simple and straightforward.<BR>(4) I will show my positive emotions.<BR>(5) I will say I am sorry when I mess up.<BR>(6) I will look at people when I talk to them...<BR>(9) I will not settle for the word \\"no.\\"<br />Could Anthony be any more trite?

For Certain Professionals	First, let's make clear that this book is about how to conduct cold calls to set up appointments.  It isn't about how to sell a product over the phone.  Therefore, it'll only help you if you sell &quot;big ticket&quot; items such as consulting, computer systems, financial services, or other similar products or services.  If you sell magazine subscriptions, or the new and improved X5 Widget Plus, you're out of luck.<br />Next, the book is slightly repetative and could have been easily condensed into a 2,000-3,500 word article.  However, that doesn't mean that it isn't a very powerful and productive system.  In fact, the system Mr. Schiffman spells out is terrific.  Management consultants have been using this system for years (although most of us haven't realized it) with dramatic effect.  Despite the corny cover design and relatively poor editing, I highly recommend this book for any professional looking for a system to increase sales appointments.  Overall grade: A-A+.	2003-07-17

The people at Watson Wyatt never stop amazing me.  Recently, I purchased a copy of the Gallup Organization's &quot;Follow This Path.&quot;  Having read it, I was convinced that there was nothing left to say.  Wrong.  Pfau and Kay have written an amazing book that documents the correlation between Strategic HR practices and Shareholder Value growth.  Well done.  One reviewer complains that the book isn't comprehensive enough.  I'm not sure this is a fair critisism.  After all, the book details 21 HR practices and their impact on TSR (Total Shareholder Return).  Certainly, one book cannot possibly provide a comprehensive treatment of all 21 HR practices.  However, since when has any professional relied upon a single business book in any subject as their sole resource?  This is a fantastic book.  I strongly recommend that any senior executive (including CEO, COO, and board memebers) pick up a copy.  I also recommend &quot;Follow this Path,&quot; Gubman's &quot;The Talent Solution,&quot; Risher's &quot;Aligning Pay and Results,&quot; and Lawler's &quot;Treat People Right.&quot;  Overall grade: AAA+++	2003-06-21

This book gives you the power to say \\"Thank you, but no thank you\\" to the legions of high-priced consultants (like myself) who offer to help design, establish and implement your company's balanced scorecard.<br />While Robert Kaplan did write the introduction, he and Norton must be very dissappointed that they didn't write this book -- I'm certainly sorry that I didn't write it.

Instead, the book focuses on the mechanics of leadership and strategy implementation. As a strategy consultant, I find myself recommending this book to clients again and again.

Really disappointed.  We purchased this book for use within our Big Five consulting team.  For some reason, we never really used it.  When I left to work for a smaller strategy consulting firm, I soon found out why.  The book is geared exclusively for software and IT proposals.  It is so specific that very little transfers to other uses.  Also -- and this is a big negative as far as I'm concerned -- there is very little discussion on the importance of stressing client benefits over product attributes.  In fact, the book spends most of its time discussing how to communicate product specifications and implementation processes.  Understand, buyers purchase your products and services because they benefit the buyer.  Not because they are thrilled with your \\"gee-whiz\\" and \\"whiz-bang\\" product attributes.  They want to know how much will this service save me?  how much more profit will I earn?  Your proposal is a marketing tool.  It must clearly underscore the benefits your customer will derive from the purchase of your product or service over other alternatives.  However, you never would have known of the importance of writing the proposal from the client's view after having read this disappointing book.	2003-06-03

As an experienced consultant, I was surprised to find the amount of useful information in this book that I did. As a \\"...For Dummies\\" book, I expected that the information would be too basic for anyone with any real experience. Certainly, the book is geared toward beginners; however, I felt that the initial client interview checklist, suggestions for creating an implemenation plan, post-implementation impact study, and information on interim and final reports were really solid (although they could/should all be addressed in more detail). My one real complaint about this book is the lack of any meaningful discussion on proposals. All professionals new to consulting should know that proposals are an important marketing tool. Sure, there are a lot of consultants who avoid writing them, but the purpose of the proposal is not only to market the current project but A CHAIN OF PROJECTS. Proposals don't have to be overly complex. In fact, 65-85% of the material can be standard boilerplate. However, when you are long gone and your presentation is all but forgotten, your proposal and final reports will likely still be around. Believe me, the proposal is a powerful marketing device (if done correctly). Unfortunately, this book provides zero insight into how to craft a winning proposal. Otherwise, this is a good little guide for new consultants.

After having read two of Holz' other books, I was really looking forward to receiving the \\"...Brochure and Letter Handbook\\" -- particularly since our firm is currently revising its brochure.  Unfortunately, the book spends most of its time describing the various types of brochures and their uses instead of how to actually write one.  Important questions such as what sections should be included in the brochure? and what words and graphics are most powerful? have been glossed over.  Instead, Holtz spends too much time describing the brochures he has included as examples.  Whats wrong with this?  Well, the examples are circa 1980s and even then they would have been considered relatively low quality.  Suggestions to print or photocopy your narrative on blank pre-printed brochures is a sure way to announce to potential clients that \\"I am a low-quality, work-from-my-kitchen consultant.\\"  What about other components of your marketing kit?  I haven't found any mention of such valuable additions.  Consider Holtz's recommendation that, if you have a number of specialties, you should have several different brochures.  Really? Maybe he should explain this to the world's largest consultancies.  Instead, they typically use general brochures featuring folder pockets die-cut on the inner front and rear covers.  This way they can continue to use their general brochure and then include a cover letter, additional material describing their specialities, articles their firms have written, a copy of their newsletter(s), press releases, client testimonials, and/or a host of other information.  Holtz's examples of model letters are also horrible.  The language, in particular, is noteable for its use of 1950s and 1960s style formality.  Consulting is a business based upon relationships.  Your letters, therefore, should be reflective of the relationships you've established (or wish to establish) with your clients.  They should be warm, personable, and sincere.  I'm so disappointed in this book that I'm thinking of reviewing my other Holz books with a more critical eye.  If they don't measure up to my original evaluation, I'll discard them to make room for more valuable resources.

If you're interested in getting ideas on how to present ideas graphically, this is a good little book.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, several of the articles were prepared by graphic designers (some by hand in fact) and not computer graphics packages.  If you're looking for suggestions on how to present ideas graphically, this is perfectly fine,... even useful.  However, if you're looking for information on how to prepare graphics using Excel, you're out of luck (however, there are dozens of other books that can help you).  That's just not what this books is about.  Instead, the book gives you several suggestions for expressing the relationship between various activities (flow charts, diagrams, etc) illustrating performance timelines (bar graphs, area graphs, etc), and other information.  However, where this book really shines, is in showing you how to incorporate various illustrations into your graphics to make them truly unique and informative.  The benefit of this book is in teaching you how to conceptialize and develop unique graphics -- not in telling you how to produce generic off-the-shelf graphics.  I'd recommend this book, along with \\"Information Graphics\\" by Harris and \\"Digital Diagrams\\" by Bounford, to anyone interested in learning more about charts.  Overall Grade: B+/A-	2003-04-14

The quality of the audio cassette I received was so bad I couldn't concentrate on the actual content.  Ann moved back and forth from the microphone which, of course, increased and decreased the microphone's \\"pick up.\\" In addition, it contained a countless number of popping \\"P\\"s.  However, most annoying of all, the tape sounded as if it was recorded at the bottom of a large tin can -- the tape was very flat (mono).  When paying forty dollars for a single cassette tape, I expect more than merely an amateur production; I expect and am entitled to a professional production.  Very dissappointed.	2003-04-13

Its too hard to find what you need.  This book is a prime example of why I hate this format.  As an example, let's assume that you want information on \\"Getting People to Participate.\\"  You go to the corresponding section and now have to wade through every question in the section to find something that may or may not be applicable to you and your session.  There's no doubt that there is some useful information to be found in this book; unfortunately, its just too darned hard to find it.  Save your money and buy a copy of \\"The Ultimate Training Workshop Handbook\\" instead.	2003-03-23

The book is not absolutely horrible.... its just so fundamentally basic as to be elementary.  The principal message: add up all of your expenses along with how much you want to earn and simply make certain that you charge customers/clients more.  Hummmm... food for thought.  If you've ever taken a business class in high school (not to mention college, an MBA program, or have any business experience at all), this book is beneath you.  Otherwise, the book has been well-written and well-illustrated.  Grade: C-/D+	2003-03-07

Based upon the previous reviewers' comments, I was really looking forward to receiving Julian's tape.  Unfortunately, the tape is literally an autobiography of Julian's past efforts at audio publishing.  It is not presented as a \\"how to\\" which was precisely what I had been lead to expect.  As interesting as Julian's war stories may be, they are not terribly informative to those of us looking for the nuts-and-bolts of audio publishing.  The quality of the recording is modest (not bad at all for a do-it yourselfer; however, not studio quality).  Save your money and purchase of copy of \\"Words on Tape\\" instead.

This book is merely a compilation of case studies.  There are few -- if any -- check lists, tables, charts, bullet points, or step-by-step methodologies to help you implement the concepts within your own company or organization.  In fact, THERE ARE ONLY 21 PAGES not dedicated exclusively to either a case study and/or an analysis of the various case studies presented within the book.

I was really looking forward to receiving this tape.  However, the material was really not \\"as advertised.\\"  Rather than demonstrate how to tailor a single speech to numerous audiences, Mr. Burgett suggests that we build a database of 100 or more components.  Then we simply pick-and-choose and rearrange the various components from our extensive database.  Interesting.  But hardly \\"Earn[ing] Happily Everafter with One Speech.\\"  Also he spends a great deal of time talking about the basics of research.  Quite simply, I was after a unique methodology of adapting a speech (or speeches) to a broader array of audiences.  Also, the tape was very amateurish.  It appears that it was recorded at his home with an inexpensive recorder.  At a couple of points in the tape, I could hear the sound of doors opening and closing.  I guess I deserve to share some of the blame; after all, what should I have expected for $...?  My advice is to save your money and do a search on the web -- you'll find far more useful information... and it'll be free.	2003-01-10

The entire book and tape revolve around this single message.  Mr. Peters provides no implementable plan or suggestions on how to adapt this message to you, your department, or company.  In fact, you have to ask yourself, \\"Is it truly necessary to change everything?\\"  Most of us would have to say \\"No.\\"  In fact, this is more often than not a recipe for f-a-i-l-u-r-e.  Instead, A RETURN TO BASICS is what is needed in 90-95.0% of the cases.   However, my biggest complaint isn't that I believe Mr. Peters is wrong, it is that his recent books and tapes are filled with superfluous and outragious statements that fail to advance the listener's or reader's understanding of the concept.  When I buy a management book or tape, I want information and concepts that I can quickly take to my company and implement to our mutual benefit.  Unfortunately, Mr. Peters' recent works appear to be nothing more than pep-talks and cheerleading sessions.  You have to ask yourself: \\"Where's the beef?\\"	2003-01-04

What luck!!! The authors provide a wealth of knowledge that is immediately implementable. When so many business books merely serve as \\"sales pieces\\" for their consultant-authors, it is sometimes surprising to find one that is actually actionable. I highly recommed this book to anyone interested in market-based management and value-chain management. [One note of caution: This book is ALL business. In otherwords, it can take a little \\"work\\" to read through a small number of dry and technically written sections. However, I think you'll agree with me when I say that it is more than worth the effort.] Two thumbs way up!!	2002-12-14

Marty Whitman is one of the &quot;deans&quot; of modern value investing.  Unfortunately, I believe he's been tainted by his role at Yales' School of Management.  The problem with this book is that he works too hard to make his writing style &quot;academic.&quot;  As a result, his points are rarely easily communicated to the reader.  Despite having attended one of the Nation's leading business schools (much more highly-ranked than Yale's SOM), I often felt that gleaning information from this book was like having my teeth pulled -- painful.  If Marty would like, I could easily refer him to a number of other books that communicate much more complicated material in a far easier to understand manner.  Perhaps he could use one as model for future editions.  However, in spite the writing style, the material is quite useful and insightful.  Definately worth the price.	2002-09-05

Let me start off immediately by saying that I have no vested interest in promoting this book.  However, having said that, THIS BOOK IS BY FAR THE BEST I've seen focused on aligning employees and corporate strategy.  The book provides very meaningful and immediately implementable ideas on how to incorporate performance-based compensation systems throughout the organization.  \\"Aligning Pay and Results\\" would be particularly useful for managers and companies implementing a shareholder value program.  Certainly, there are other books which cover the subject well and even expand upon some of the ideas; but I have yet to find one that does it better.  \\"Aligning Pay and Results\\" is absolutely a \\"must buy.\\"	2002-04-18

Of course, for senior M&A advisors, Hooke's book is also the perfect \\"leave behind\\" to educate prospective clients on the entire M&A process.<br />However, if I had the opportunity to extend a single suggestion to Jeffrey Hooke for future editions, it would be: Have a new cover designed which more fully reflects the level of quality and excitement of the text!!!	1999-08-27
