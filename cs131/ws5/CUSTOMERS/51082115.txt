Â Mix one dead (by accident?) rock & roll star, his ambitious widow, and some lost tapes for a comeback album. Add in Jack Tagger, a once famous reporter, now reduced to writing obituaries, who has an idea the rocker's death may not have been the accident it seems.<br />Carl Hiassen's latest romp has wit, style and fun to spare. And if you've ever worked at a newspaper, you'll love all the inside jokes. Hiassen's biting humor, fun characters and inside knowledge of newspapers (and insight into the music biz) make this higly recommended. And there's a unique use of a frozen lizard!	2003-03-31

College student Ed (our hero), is dumped by his girlfriend. He gets involved with a new love,and has run ins with night wanderers, cannibals, psychos and... well, it gets weirder (and kinkier) from there.<br />Laymon has a nice flair for the creepy, but some of the elements just don't gel together, and the ending is rushed. We never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care, and the bad guy is just a meaningless plot device with weird kinks.<br />For a better treatment of a similar theme, try the out of print &quot;The Night People&quot; by Jack Finney.	2002-11-08

Cussler (along with Craig Dirgo) recounts the real-life searches for a number of famous shipwrecks (and a lost locomotive) in this non-fiction book. You'll see the inspiration for a lot of the fictional Dirk Pitt's adventures in Cussler's narratives.<br />While the book is enjoyable, some of the searches are given a shorter shrift, and others are longer, leaving you wanting more. Also, each section is preceded by a &quot;dramatic&quot; rendering of how a ship was lost, and some of these sections are a bit flat. Actually, I wanted more detail on Cussler's searches and his adventures with his NUMA buddies.<br />Still, if you like Cussler's Pitt adventures, and love sea stories, you'll want to at least give this a look.	2001-08-08

Her aunt (and enemy?) The Queen of Air and Darkness, wishes her to return to the land of Faerie. But why? This is an exciting, erotic, well-written fantasy adventure, and is definitely a bit removed from Ms. Hamilton's other series, the Anita Blake novels.<br />If you enjoy sensual (let's say VERY sensual) fantasy/adventure, dive into Merry's adventures; you'll be glad you did.	2001-02-12

She's been hiding out in California working as a private detective, until her old life catches up with her in some very interesting ways. Her aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness, wants her to return to the Court. Of course, up til now, Merry thought her aunt wanted to kill her - so what's going on now?<br />You'll enjoy sifting through the various plot twists, the great characters, and a LOT of sensuality and sexual content. This one's not for the kids, folks.<br />A bit different from the Anita Blake series, but great escapist fun.	2001-02-05

Batman finds himself in the position of being the protector of the fabled Holy Grail.

However, the supporting cast and the villain (s) are all well  drawn, and  the Corporate takeover setting is a welcome twist.<br />Good, but  not highly recommended.	2000-05-05

Yes, it's a surprising adventure with a young Will searching for his mentor's killer, and romancing a lovely young lady  named Rebecca Lopez who has problems of her own (she's a secret Jew, in  hiding from the Inquisition). You may also notice some interesting  similarities to the film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; and Kellerman's  book came first!<br />While it's a good read, the book does go on a tad too  long (a sometime failing of Kellerman's), and the revelation of the killer  seems a bit tacked on, as Rebecca's story takes center stage late in the  book. Still, this is a very entertaining novel, and well worth a look.	1999-10-06

Here, I didn't feel I got inside the characters heads or feelings  enough.<br />Not recommended.	1999-09-21

This is the first Kellerman novel I've read, but I know from her history that this is a big change of pace for her. It's a book that owes a lot to the &quot;Night Stalker&quot; series of the 70s, sort of crosswired with a  detective story. An excellent mix of ideas that have been done before in a  novel way.   But one of the flaws of the novel is that it has  a big cast  of caharcters, and there's not enough time  to develop them all.<br />Still,  this is an intriguing novel, and a good summer read. Let's hope we see more  of Romulus Poe in future adventures.	1999-08-12

Still, it's a good summer read full of action, narrow escapes, and a pretty clever plot  about a conspiracy that leads to the heart of the Vatican.<br />However, there  is a last page revelation that sort of negates what has come before.

Siddons gets beneath the  veneer of suburban living, and shows how the unknown can unravel even the  most solid realtionships. This book is atmospheric, spooky and unsettling.

Despite the  cover copy's assertion that these are stories by the &quot;masters of  science fiction&quot; at least two of the stories (those by H.P. Lovecraft  and Clive Barker) are clearly horror tales, and Donald A. Wollheim's  &quot;Mimic&quot; at least skirts that genre.  Also, there are a couple of  stories included that are relatively minor entries in an authors ouvre,  such as Robert Silverberg's &quot;Amanda and the Alien,&quot; included  because it was made into a cheesy cable film several years ago.  Still this  is a good collection of tales, particularly if you've been disappointed  with the film versions of such classic stories as Barry Longyear's  &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; and Philip K. Dick's &quot;Second Variety&quot;  (filmed as &quot;Screamers&quot;). Worth a look, but a mixed bag.	1998-08-21

I know a lot of reviewers have criticized him for the length of this book, but I found it absolutely enthralling. The further adventures of Dr. Kriezler and his stalwart band of investigators makes for great reading.

But in telling the tale, Lehane offers us a view inside the SOUL of his main characters, and their own reactions to the kind of evil and prejudice they uncover. I read the second Kenzie/Gennaro novel (Darkness, Take My Hand) first, and this is equally well-done. Miles ahed of the rest of the run-of-the-mill Chandler wannabes, Lehane is a writer who entertains us, and makes us think. Highly recommended.	1998-06-24

Still, it's a fun, well-paced read, and he stays true to the characters of both universes. For fans, the Epilogue is a special treat! Perfect summer reading for Star Trek and X-Men fans.

I had heard a LOT of great things about this novel, and Stephenson is certainly creative, but we never get inside the minds and feelings of these characters. The technological aspects of the novel (and the neat twist on the computer virus idea) are superb, and there is some excellent descriptive work. But it just doesnt have the strength of characters who really move the story, and involve you in it.  A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME.	1997-10-06
US	51082115	R15ZICAYW1PTYF	1856957071	645212410	Red Harvest (Isis Series)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Solid hard-boiled detecive novel inspired 3 films	Red Harvest by Dashiell Hammett, is a tense, fast-paced well written tale of Hammett's hero, The Continental OP, cleaning up a criminal-ridden town by setting all the various factions againts each other. I enjoyed this novel, though I prefer Raymond Chandler's style to Hammett's. Hammett's is a little more sparse. However, if you searching for a good introduction to the genre, here's a good place to start.  Trivia note: This novel has inspred three movies (none credited the book as inspiration). Toshiro Mifune as a samurai in YOJIMBO; Clint Eastwood as the man with No Name in FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and more recently, Bruce Willis in LAST MAN STANDING.	1997-09-19

Unfortunately, it runs out of steam a bit toward the end. But this is stilla  great beach or late nite read and Maxim is a talent to watch	1997-09-09

I borrowed this from a friend originally, then had to go out and buy my own copy! Fluid writing, fast-paced action sequences and a main charcter you can identify with. Dave Elliot wakes up one day and finds his well-ordered life (job, wife, e tc.) turned upside down as his boss pulls a gun on him and he's trapped in his office building with people who want to kill him! Don't start this unless youre prepared to finish it! Highly recommended!	1997-09-09

A compelling story of a man's search for meaning in his life (and sorting out his realtionship with his late father) set against a background of journeying back through time to meet with rock icons like Hnedrix and Morrison, who represent various parts of Ray's (the main character's) psyche.  Shiner's knowledge of rock history is excellent and the plot device used to send our hero back in time is less techno-oriented and more &quot;Twilight Zone-ish&quot; in nautre.    This is a highly enjoyable novel. If you're a music fan, don't let the sci-fi tag steer you away from this, and vice versa.	1997-08-01
US	51082115	R2YFTODGWYEWK5	0804111359	207158162	The Secret History	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Well-written character study of college kids &amp; murder	An intriguing first novel about a group of college friends whose love of Greek classicism (and a great teacher) leads to murder.  While many critics have found this book pretentious, I found the characters interesting and well drawn. In fact, the charcters are the most interesting part of the book. The murder that occurs and what leads up to it is less interesting than getting inside these characters heads.    Read this for a well-written look at five people and a look inside their heads as they go through a terrible year in college.    If you're looking for a good mystery however, look elsewhere. This is a character study.	1997-08-01

That's not the case here: Ian McDowell's novel is excellent! Told from the point of view of Mordred, Arthur's bastard son by his sister Morgawse, this is an inetersting twist on an oft-told tale. The characters really come alive, and Mordred (often relegated to second rate villain status) is fully fleshed out here.  The novel is full of emotion, and the characters REALLY come alive. Telling the story from Mordred's point of view makes for some interesting viewpoints (Merlin a pervert?) but it's all smashingly done!    I can't wait for the sequel!	1997-08-01
