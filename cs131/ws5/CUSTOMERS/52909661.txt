I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I bought this book.  The premise sounded a little hokey and I thought that the psychic angle had been done to death, but I was really wrong.  Contact is well written, well plotted with incredible description and great characters.  You can't ask for more in a book.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone to read and if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  Read it, you won't be disappointed.	2005-03-11

I made it to page 60 before I had to stop reading it.  Parts of it were like watching Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Dracula movie.  I found it difficult to feel anything for the characters.  Nor could I truly get a good picture of them.  The plot skipped all over the place and I found it hard to follow at some points.  I don't recommend it to anyone.	2005-01-24

I was pleasantly surprised.  The plot was fast paced, well-crafted and believable.  The romance (which was also well done and well developed) wasn't the main thrust of the book, the story was.  The only problem I had with this particular book is that I didn't get a complete mental image of the three main characters, Jake, Nikki and Michael.  I suspect that the problem was that I hadn't read the other books in the series published before this one.  But, since I loved this one so much, I intend to not only read those books, but the rest of Ms. Arthur's books.  A great read!	2004-12-31

I began it with the hopes of reading an original story and, if she could have pulled it off, using a nuclear bomb to garner American pressure to get the British out of Northern Ireland is interesting.  However, I found it uninteresting and the romance was soooo predictable and so annoying.  Charlotte immediately feels something for her captor and after a few hours ends up in bed with him.  Finding out that he's her long lost ex-husband who is also a terrorist puts her back in bed with him.  Same cookie cutter as all the other bad romances.  I was so disappointed that I skimmed every ten pages until I got to the end.	2003-09-01

I got none of those things.  The relationship between the hero and heroine was poorly developed, I felt nothing for any of the characters, the plot was far from riveting and I skipped most of the book just to get to the end to find out who the Angel was.  The sub plot involving Detectives Garrison and Kelso and Garrison's ex-husband was much more interesting.  It was just a disappointing book.	2003-02-27

The romance between Mike and Joan isn't full of sparks and fire, but it's still sweet.  Regardless, it moved fast with a great plot that you just can't seem to put down.  I have to admit that I was really interested in the ongoing Sam/Alyssa thing and I figured that I'd just skip to those parts, but Brockmann makes it hard to do that.  You want to read the entire book.  I was also eager to see how she dealt with the infamous Mary Lou and I wasn't disappointed.  I still don't like her, but her story is really, really good.  I also really enjoyed the secondary WWII story, it was just as well developed as the rest of the book.  Never a dull moment.  I'd highly recommend it!	2002-11-30

Out of all the books in Brockmann's SEAL Team 16 series, I enjoyed this one the most.  The plot is rivetting and complex.  Each character, and there is a multitude of them, is amazingly well-developed so you 'feel' for each one of them.  The setting is exotic and compelling in and of itself.  And I even enjoyed the secondary story she wove through this one.  In the past I've skimmed over them, but this one I enjoyed and it fit into the main story really well.  The only thing I didn't like about this book was the way the story between Locke and Starrett ended up.  But the series isn't over yet...  It was just a great book and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a fantastic read!  I can honestly say that this is one of the best books I've ever read.	2002-03-06

However, while you feel for the heroine, the other characters are rather undeveloped leaving you wondering at the end why she even bothered to put them in the book.  The romantic element in this book is ridiculous and contrived.  She could have left it out and the book would have been a five star.  The romance seems unlikely and lacks emotion.  Read it for the suspense.	2001-12-05
US	52909661	RVXA30QRAWWVZ	1551668386	988408599	The Conspiracy	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Really interesting plot.	This was the first of Cresswell's books that I actually liked.  The plot is interesting especially in light of today's terrorist activities and it's well crafted and rolls at a good pace.  However, the main characters fall in love without much pretext. Yes, they've known each other for a long time and yes, they've kissed and noticed an attraction, but they go from finally getting together after three years of avoidance to a hastily crafted sex scene.  I didn't feel much of a connection to Verity once she became sober.  Michael had about as much emotion as a stick.  The use of a ghost works when he first appears, but then it becomes obvious that he's just there to shove the book along.  You read his words and think - oh, please, give me a break.  At times the dialogue was stilted and strained and there was a great deal of 'telling' and narration that slowed it down.  But all in all, thanks to the interesting plot, it was a good read.	2001-11-12

The plot is original and unpredictable, the characters are well-developed so much so that you 'feel' with them, and the writing is great!  It was nice to see Val finally be human and have a dark side.  When I first saw that he was the hero, I almost didn't read it, but Carroll works magic with him in this book.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a really good book.	2001-10-31
US	52909661	RFYZB15TYYWSK	1929613539	427572155	Walk in Moonlight	Books	2	2	7	N	Y	Disappointing	First, let me say that I purchased this book on a recommendation and went in with no preconceived notions. But unlike the rest of the reviews, I didn't like the book.  I found its plot too sweet, too contrived and the characters hollow.  I can say that Laurey's powers of description are wonderful.  You feel like you're in the small, quaint English village or in the B and B or in Orchard House.  But even with the 'quaint' feeling, I couldn't finish the book for the reasons stated previously.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy sweet, sappy, gushy love stories, which I don't.	2001-10-24

Once I started I couldn't wait to get it over with.  As usual, it moves quickly, but it lacks substance in some places.  And seeing old characters come back is great, but none of them have really grown. In fact, I found them annoying in their consistency.  Some of it even got to me and while it bordered on the erotic, it also bordered on the gross (more so than usual).  While the ending was 'odd' (aren't they all?), it wasn't the flash that I've come to know as LKH.  The book just seemed to be too long, like she was looking for stuff to fill the pages. I'd recommend reading it to keep up with Anita's life, but only for that reason.	2001-10-22

The plot is interesting and I liked the small romantic element (hence the 4 stars), but the characters were shallow and their emotions were all over the place.  If I had to compare it to something I'd have to say that it's a really tame Anita Blake.  The vampires can't seem to figure out if they're monsters or not.  And the author mentions some things and assumes that they're common knowledge.  But, if you want a light read then it's a good choice.	2001-09-27

As a mother it was difficult for me to make it through chapters one and two, they really aren't for the feeble hearted.  But once you get past them you won't be able to put the book down.  I thought Gardner's first book was the most rivetting, compelling, well-writen, intense, yet disturbing book I'd ever read.  She topped it with this one.  The plot is intense, rivetting, complex,disturbing, well-crafted, well-written and the ending is impossible to foresee.  The characters are well-developed, interesting and unforgetable.  You won't be able to put it down once you start reading it!	2001-02-10

If you enjoy laughing out loud, falling in love and escaping to a different world read the Blue Viking - you won't be disappointed.	2001-02-07

The characters are intense, the plot is incredibly riveting and so well done.  Just when I thought I had it all figured out I discovered that I'd missed by a mile.  It's filled with suspense, romance and enough dark moments to keep you reading from cover to cover - you'll never want to put it down.  It's not like her first book.  It's not supposed to be.  It's supposed to stand on it's own and it does, it really does.	2000-11-28

I really enjoyed 'When Darkness Falls', more so than I enjoyed the first book of the trilogy - 'Beneath a Blood Red Moon'.  'When Darkness Falls' is filled with rivetting suspense, intense characters, and a sitting on the edge of your seat plot.  I hated to put it down.  Drake really shows her creative imagination in this one - her back story development on Lucian is fantastic.  I also enjoyed her discussions of good vs. evil and all the gray matter in between.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves vampires, suspense, romance or just wants a great read!	2000-11-13

When it arrived I immediately opened it then wished I hadn't.  The book is filled with the same exposition about how much Julian loves Dara, how long he's waited for her and how he has 'need of her' over and over.  After reading that narration and the tedious sex scene the second time (not even halfway through the book) I lost interest.  There isn't much diaglog so the story moves slowly.  In my opinion the book could have been over at page 150, but Feehan drags it out for 227 more pages.  It was all empty - more 'need', more 'velvet', more and more of the same sex, the same whining by Julian and Dara and the same arrogance of Darius...  Even the battle in the end - the one where Julian faces the vampire that ruined his life - is boring.  It's over in minutes.  The man spent centuries looking for the vampire only to kill him off without much effort.  Unlike her other heroes - Jacques, Gregori and Aidan, I felt nothing for Julian.  And even less for Dara.  The characters are wooden, so is the prose.  Stick to some of her other books, this one is a real sleeper.	2000-11-08

But I was disappointed.  The dialogue was good, so were her characters, even the plot was original.  What disappointed me was the writing.  She relied on so many cliches that I've read in so many other romances.  I just expected more from her.  I forced myself to finish it just to see how she brought it to a close, but I did so by reading only the dialog.  I really wanted to like it, but I didn't.	2000-11-06

I  love books where you can feel the intense emotion between the hero and  heroine, where you are so moved that all you can do is sigh - this is one  of those books.  I can't think of a single thing I didn't like.  This is  Christine Feehan at her finest.

From the first pages you're yanked in and you can't get back out until you've finished the book  (which you'll do in one sitting) - you can't put it down.  Chance and Sunny  are well-developed - you feel for them the moment you meet them.  Your  emotions run high as you follow them through their adventure and you cry  for them in the end.

This is my first book by Hayes and I bought it because of the review she received in Romantic Times.  I wasn't disappointed.  It moves quickly and has a hero and a heroine you feel for.  The only problem I had was that the  black moment wasn't so black.  It sort of left me flat.  I kept thinking  I'd find another one before the end, but I didn't.

Like every other Anita Blake book, I loved Obsidian Butterfly.  Yes, it's Anita at her best.  Yes, I missed Richard and Jean-Claude. But I'd have to disagree with others who think that this book was solely about Edward.   Through her usual flair, Hamilton shows us that one of the biggest, baddest  'monsters' in Anita's life isn't really a monster after all.  And that  maybe, just maybe, there's hope for Anita.  Hamilton gives us a view of  another side of Anita - the one who feels guilty about loving the monsters,  the one who wonders what it would be like to be with a human again.   Granted the book has serious sexual overtones (a few of which made me  cringe), but I think it makes a big statement about Anita's character.   Through her great characters, incredibly vivid description, twisting  unusual plot, and first person narrative, LKH has given us not just a book  about Edward, but a book that gives us a little bit of insight into Anita  and her future.  If you like LKH - read it.  If you're following the series  - you have to read it to fill in the holes.  If you're just looking for a  great book - read it, you won't be disappointed.	2000-01-20

As someone who enjoys feeling as if I'm part of the story, I found this book to be a very detailed, very informative how-to.  Through extensive  examples, Wood leads the writer through the pitfalls and the perks of using  description.  If you've already read other books on the subject, you will  find some things repeated here, but take a look anyway.  By choosing  passages to make a point or by rewriting a passage several times, Wood's  view is inciteful and fresh.

The dialog was stilted and forced. It lacked suspense, was long winded and beyond unbelievable.  The only thing I felt for any of the characters was  pity - they appear in such a bad book.  I got to page 81 and couldn't go  any further.  This is my first Catherine Coulter and it will be my last.	1999-08-11

Having read the trilogy - White Lies, Midnight Rainbow and Diamond Bay - backwards I can honestly say that this one is my favorite!  The plot is original, the characters are great (it was wonderful to finally get a  handle on Kell Sabin), and it's superbly written.  I'd have to say that  this is a must read for any Linda Howard fan or for anyone who loves a  great love story!	1999-08-04

This is a great book for parents and can be for children.  Its specific information that will make an awkward time easier, however, the text is very dry and may require some translation for younger children.  I bought  it for my 9 year old and was really impressed, but it needs to be screened  because not all the sections are appropriate for any age.  As always - work  with your child, explain it to them and use this book as your guide.	1999-08-04

One of the things I liked most about this book was that it didn't fit into the legendary 'romance formula', it concentrated on a plot filled with action and intrigue and let the romance come later.  However, I did miss  Howard's customary passion a little.  And while I loved the body of the  book, the ending fizzled because it seemed forced like she was only allowed  to fill so many pages and she had to wrap it up in ten or less.  The action  dies at the end as does the romance and I found it a disappointing end to a  rather interesting, fast-paced book.	1999-08-02

It's the first one of the Mackenzie saga that I've read and I loved it.  It's fast paced, interesting, has great characters and a nice plot twist at the end. Read  it, you won't be sorry.	1999-07-30
US	52909661	R23KMIEDLKD8P0	0553579630	59733836	The Last Warrior	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A fair read, but a great original plot.	If you love the art of the Japanese sword as well as San Francisco, this book will fascinate you.  The plot was interesting, her concept of an American samurai was great, but what I found disappointing was the forced  way she brings the hero and heroine together at times. I guess what I  didn't like was that it read like a 'formula romance' - boy meets girl,  they argue, they're forced together, they fall in love, have a fight,  separate, then get back together.  She needed more , at least for me, for  it to be a page turner.  But if you like a traditional romance, then buy  this one, you won't be disappointed.	1999-07-28

It tends to run a little long in parts, but the love story is sweet none-the-less.  Unlike the Bride Finder, there isn't much sexual tension and if you're looking for  steamy sex you'd better look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a sweet  love story then this one is for you.	1999-07-24

St. John's attempts at sexual tension are slightly amusing, but succumb to a lack of emotion.  However, she unfolds her story  masterfully and the ending is worth reading the rest of the book - it will  reduce you to tears.  That's why I gave it the 4 stars.  You truly 'feel'  the characters and you accompany them every step of the way.	1999-07-21

The prose is dry, the plot contrived and basically ridiculous, the dialog boring. It reads like a medical textbook.  I started  to read it by skipping ten pages at a time, but then realized that I'd have  to ignore the whole book just to get to the last page.	1999-07-12

She uses the words 'need' and 'heat' too much.  Other than that one small complaint, I find her work compelling, interesting, packed with amazing characters that  you end up falling in love with, and plots that range from other worlds to  wizards.  This book, like her others, involves a hero who can't get past  his past and a strong heroine who can't believe she's even taking the time.   But Kendall has no choice.  She is bound by her love and respect for a man  that everyone else despised, including the hero, his bastard son.  It's a  great read!	1999-07-11

Ms. Dare certainly lived up to my expectations in this follow-up to Dangerous Ground.  It was a great read that I couldn't put down.  The characters are well developed and the plot keeps you turning the pages.   It's too bad she's exhausted the Wolf Pack - I'd love to read another!  I  simply loved it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little Tom  Clancy with a romance thrown in.  You won't be disappointed.	1999-06-06

The story was touching, the characters interesting and well-developed, and it's a great way to start off the Wink and a Kiss line.   I've read all the other books in the Thorksson line and knew the  characters well and it was really touching to see Thork's second son  finally find love.  If you want a great love story read it, you won't be  disappointed.	1999-05-13
US	52909661	R27UI49S7WWBIZ	0375500898	142953671	The Marching Season: A Novel	Books	2	1	3	N	Y	Disappointing	After completing Mark of the Assassin I couldn't wait to devour The Marching Season.  However, I found it disappointing in comparison.  Reading more like a travelog of England and Northern Ireland, Silva assumes that  you're already familiar with the characters and for those who aren't you'll  be left feeling empty.  Mark of the Assassin was a page turner - I skipped  pages in The Marching Season trying to find the next section of real  action.  He's still a great read and if you only read this one you'll be  impressed.	1999-04-23

Hamilton.  What a waste of money!  The characters are developed, but they aren't interesting.  The plot is weak.  Is it a  romance?  Is it a mystery? Is it horror?  I find it hard to believe that  after a few brief questions and one date that Mitch and Diedra fall madly  in love.  The relationship isn't developed just as no other plot thread is  truly developed.  I finally stopped reading page by page around page 60 and  just skimmed the rest.  I found it highly disappointing.	1999-04-09

The plot is the same - gorgeous man finds woman in distress, takes her into his home, has sex with  her.  Yes, that's what romances are about, but Johnson keeps using the same  scenario - if you've read one of the Kuzan line or one of the Dumas line  you've read all of them.  You could easily exchange the name of Sasha Kuzan  for Pasha Dumas and it really wouldn't make much of a difference.  Her  'trademarks' are getting old.  She needs a new plot twist besides a war and  the capturing of the heroine.  She needs a plot that doesn't involve first  night sex, the philandering hero who feels the same emotions at the same  time, the reconciliation that always occurs in the same fashion with the  hero and the heroine feeling the same things as every other hero and  heroine, and if I have to read one more time that the hero is so distraught  over the pain endured by his true love in childbirth (&quot;He turned pale  watching her suffer, wincing at each labor pain, deciding, as the ordeal  continued for what seemed endless hours that he would see that she never  had another child.&quot;) I may scream.  Every hero says it or thinks it!   Every book is the same!!!  Sure her books are hot.  Sure they're sexy.  But  its the same sex!  I am so disappointed that I won't be picking up another  Susan Johnson novel - as I've said - if you've read one, you've read them  all.	1999-04-01

I selected With All My Heart because San Francisco is one of my favorite cities.  The first two chapters were slow, but once you get past the build-up and the necessary scene setting  it's a great book.  I haven't read the others in the series, but it didn't  matter.  Ms. Goodman weaves enough of the details into her story that the  reader isn't left scratching her head wondering who these people are.  The  romance is touching, the characters well developed and the plot is full of  twists and turns so you have no idea what's going to happen next.  I'd  recommend it to anyone who enjoys the city or a good romance.	1999-04-01

As a fan of the early Tom Clancy I was again disappointed in his later works.  Ruthless.com has a fair plot but with too many characters to really follow.  Clancy fails to develop most of the characaters thus keeping the  reader from becoming attached to them and not really caring what happens to  them.  I was slightly intrigued by the plot until it fell apart at the end  leaving me wondering why I didn't follow my first hunch and leave it  sitting on the bookstore shelf.	1999-02-10

I can't say enough good things about it. It divides the city into neighborhoods then goes through each one not only listing the good  points and points of interest, but also listing the bad.  The information  is practical and easy to find and understand.  His carefully researched  data helps one understand the city and the culture that make it so unique.   From parking garages to street vendors this is the book to have on San  Francisco.	1999-01-14

I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I enjoyed  The Killing Dance.  This one is big on detail and lycanthropy with the vampires taking a back seat, but it's great to see Anita finally find some balance between  becoming a monster and remaining human.  I look forward to the next one to  see how she answers all the questions she raises in this book.	1998-12-11
