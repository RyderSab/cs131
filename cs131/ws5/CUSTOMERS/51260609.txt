Karen Kelley did an incredible job weaving erotism into a well-written plot that threathens romance with murder and betrayal. And many kudos for the secondary romances as well!! I enjoy stories set in New Orleans but when I am taken (as a reader) into the Louisiana bayous...that is when the fun really begins. The scene of the heroine taking the hero out into the swamp in a piroque, for safe keeping, was just awesome....and then when they hit land....I will never forget it. YUM!! Southern Exposure is quite simply...fantastic!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-22

After twenty plus years of marriage, Anne Marie Jackson's husband leaves her for a younger woman, then her friend persuades her to take the vacation of a life time. In Italy, Anne Marie plans to meet up with Giovanni, the Italian guy she had meet in high school when he had been a foreign student in America. She had had a crush on him then and now that she is free from a ho hum marriage, she wonders if she and Giovanni will become more than friends. However, he is proving to be very elusive, and instead her attention is claimed by a sexy stranger she sees casually lounging outside her hotel when she arrives. <br />Marco Moretti is definitely more than he seems, and Anne Marie notices he is eager to meet up with Giovanni as much as she is, but wonders why. Marco offers himself as her personal tour guide and Anne Marie finds him very hard to resist. When events happen to make her cautious of him, she tries to distance herself but he is always there...when she needs him and when she does not. Anne Marie can not resist Marco, and finds herself falling hard for this gorgeous, mysterious Italian man. <br />There is only one thing I like better than a Cajun hero and that is an Italian one!! \\"That's Amore\\" is like a Harlequin Presents (a series line I enjoy very much!) but much, much better, as it is a longer length story. The heroine had always longed to visit Italy and she truly has the trip of a lifetime, the highlight being the sexy hero. He is such a modern guy, from his ever present cell phone to a loving grandmother that wants him to marry and have bambinos. Visiting Italy myself has always been a dream of mine and I lived it vicariously through this heroine. *g* Carol Grace blended this story with so much authentic Italian allure and flavor that I was totally absorbed. \\"That's Amore\\" is a wonderful romance, Italian-style!	2003-07-02

He vows to help her locate her  father and she refuses to let him do it alone. But emotions run high, as  Lorenz is deeply in love with her and has asked for her hand in marriage,  only to be turned down. Hurt and angry, Lorenz sets off in search of her  father, without her, only to discover the dirty ruffian trailing him is  none other than his beloved...Emilie.<br />This couple's struggle between each  other will hold you enthralled.

Jake Donnelly can not believe his beloved Aunt Sophie left everything she owned to her dog in her will. Even his favorite piece of property, the  cabin he grew up in, on the lake. Which is all he really cared about  anyway. And to make matters worse, his aunt wants him to be Muffin's  caretaker. How does a tough FBI agent deal with this ordeal? But deal he  must or turn over Muffin, and the inheritance, to a dog shrink. So Jake  grudgingly takes ownership of the long suffering canine and learns he must  take Muffin on his yearly two week vacation at a dog resort. Ridiculous as  it all is, Jake has to abide by the will, but he is not happy....until he  sees the lovely spa owner.<br />LeAnne Crosby owner of Happy Hounds, loves  Muffin and is very happy to see him on his arrival. She is instantly  attracted to Sophie's nephew and sizes up the situation between man and  dog. And knows she must help them, as Sophie loved these two males dearly  while she was alive. She patiently and tenderly coaches Jake on how to care  for his dog. And happily watches as the bereaved animal reluctantly starts  to respond to his new owner. But all does not go well...within days, LeAnne  is shot at and Jake takes her and Muffin away from the resort for safety.  They spend precious time together in the cabin and naturally their love and  passion for each other grows. Jake starts to deal with some emotional  issues from his childhood with the love and help of LeAnne. Sigh!<br />This  story was delightful and touching. Although the shooting and fleeing from  bad guys was an important part of the story, it did not overpower the  humorous element. This book is a well plotted story with entertaining  characters and satisfying to the very end and I enjoyed it a great deal.	2000-08-12

His mother has been taken in by a young woman that is nothing short of a con. Rose Severin, better none as  Desire√©, travels around as a spiritualist. She longs to become an actress  but until that time she performs seances to help the loved ones of dearly  departed souls make peace with their grief. Travis does not accept what  this woman pratices as a job for one minute. And he vows to expose her  fraudulent business and has her arrested for fraud, then run out of  town.<br />His mother wants to see her sons wedded and she longs for  grandchildren, so she sets out to make this happen, starting with her  oldest son. The scheme she pulls is certainly effective, which sends Travis  roaring out of town to bring back the thief that stole his mother's wedding  ring. Oh boy, the fireworks explode in this Texas town!<br />This story kept  me amused as the gypsish heroine went all out to keep the hero in a  constant state of upheaval. Much to my delight, as he was a tad arrogant  and needed to be brought down a peg or two and this heroine did it quite  nicely. Her antics had him falling for her in spite of what he thought of  her wrong doings. They were great together! I do look forward to the rest  of this trilogy as I am curious to see what lengths Mama Burnett will go to  to have her other sons wedded as well. She is definitely an interesting  character!	2000-08-12

This is the first book I have read of Ms Hill's and if this story is any indication of what she is capable of, then I have to say I have been missing out on some fantastic books. I am truly hooked on this author now  and I am going to dig her other books out and read them as soon as  possible.   Lucien LeDeux has been labeled 'bad boy of the bayou' since  childhood and for good reason, as he has made the label a self-fulfilling  prophecy with his audacious teasing of the Creole-born Sylvie Fontaine. He  issues a threat to her at a school dance when they were both thirteen, that  they would one day slow dance in the nude. Now twenty years later, he still  feels a strong urge to shock and dismay her.   Luc is a lawyer and his  brother's dilemma demands that he seek Sylvie's expertise as a chemist to  test contaminated bayou water for oil spillage from his father's company.  Upon his arrival in her lab, he encounters her in the midst of a secret  experiment and as always he 'rattles her cage' and in the chaos he  unintentionally eats her jelly beans that is loaded with a love potion that  she has invented. She was on the verge of testing it on a human subject and  is freaked out when her childhood nemesis gulps down the potion that she  knows will make him sexually hungry for her. At this point is when the fun  begins!    I absolutely loved this story!  It is outrageously funny and  the romance is wonderful. Not only was the story of the hero and heroine  great but the secondary characters were enjoyable as well, from Luc's  lovable little aunt Tante Lulu to Samson and Delilah, Sylvie's 'in love lab  rats', this story held my interest from the first to the last page. This  book is a romance reader's dream!	1999-12-18
