However, the Angry Left and their behavior in this election has brought me back into the fold...just look at some of the venom spewed in the reviews here.  The fact is, Coulter is an extremist, but a necessary antidote to the fantasies of the left.  Just the other day, I heard a father tell his son in a used bookstore that the Rosenbergs were innocent.  No one who has read Coulter's Treason would still buy that line.<br /><br />As for this book, because it is mostly reprints of her column, it avoids one of the most serious flaws her previous works have fallen prey to...that of very poor editing.  Ann has a knack for saying the same thing over and over...is she fleshing out the page count?  I don't know.  As to the content, well, you know what to expect by now.  I do know this, however - a world with Michael Moore in it needs an Ann Coulter.	2004-10-18

This book IS NOT some bloated Noam Chomsky fairy tale about America and its misdeeds throughout time; it IS a very nice survey of the 'special relationship' between America and Great Britain, and its enduring components of blood, class, and nostalgia (as the original title that I own went).<br /><br />So, look elsewhere for loony paranoid fantasies; here you will only find the usual intelligent Hitchens style.	2004-10-05

The problem is, he's pretty damn funny.  Now, I don't care for Al's point of view on almost every issue, but, with the exception of P.J. O'Rourke, we Republicans are a little short on the humorous side.  Franken scores some easy points of off Ann Coulter and garners HUGE laughs with the Chickenhawks chapter, but he fails to make a convincing case that the media is not biased (particularly in the wake of Rathergate).  And yes, I know Fox is biased to the right, and I admit it...but even NPR won't admit a leftist bias.  NPR!!!  But such is the divided society we live in.<br /><br />Liberals should love this...conservatives with a thick skin and a sense of humor will enjoy it, too, for the most part.	2004-10-01

(Here's a tip for you guys...if you want to lose every election from here on out, keep it up!).<br /><br />Collier and Horowitz, as editors of this fine tome, have put the nail in the coffin of Chomsky's reputation.  Time and time again, we have seen this apostle of the disenchanted 'progressives' (progressive - what a joke!) blame America for every single wrong in the World.  Why, if the United States didn't exist, what a wonderful world we would live in.  More problematic than his extreme opinions, however, is his blatant disregard for truthfulness, well-documented here (Michael Moore, anyone?).<br /><br />I am a big fan of democracy, and that means different perspectives and opinions.  How sad it is, though, that 'left' has, as in the late Vietnam era, once again become synonymous with anti-U.S., and how fitting that a Vietnam-era protester, who has his own problems with the truth, is the left's new standard-bearer.

What struck me, besides the book's considerable merits, among them being a good story exhaustively researched, and well told, was how much of this will be overshadowed by the Oscar-winning movie adaptation.<br />How many members of the Academy had read this book before casting their Best Picture votes?  I would submit, very few indeed.  Although the movie has some fine points (the lovely Jennifer Connelly, a decent performance by Russell Crowe, and a nice visual look), it so distorts the story as to turn it into a work of fiction.  Others have detailed these descrepancies in greater detail than I have the time, patience, or space for, but just to name two very obvious ones will suffice - the delusional fantasy of the college roommate and his daughter, a key, if not central, element of the movie, is a complete falsehood; and the hokey, if emotionally satisfying, speech at the Noble Prize ceremony is another Hollywood add-on that struck me as false even before I read this fine book.  In any event, read the book - it has plot twists and turns enough, without fictional embellishments, and deserves its own audience, and for that matter, enjoy the movie, too - as a fictional work based very, very loosely on the truth.	2003-06-15

He is not a historian, per se, but a mouthpiece, really.  This is not a criticism - those who confide in him occupy the highest positions of authority in this world of ours.  That having been said, Woodward is at his best, as is often the case in this book, when he is revealing what went on behind closed doors, and at his worst, as this book also illustrates, in providing perspective.  Perhaps this is why his greatest source, the slippery Deep Throat, helped him so much in launching his career - he provided perspective more than details, sort of a ying to Woodward's yang.<br />Bush at War should perhaps be titled Powell at War (with Rumsfield).  It is clear that Colin Powell was his primary source, the provider of the notes (well, I would guess also Rice, to some extent) of the National Security Council meetings that provide the backbone of this chronicle.  While it is clear that Woodward was given some access to all the primary participants (Tenet also appears to have been a primary source), the hawk wing of Rumsfield, Wolfowitz, Perle, et al, is given short shrift.  Obviously, they chose not to participate as fully.  Why?<br />The answer would appear to be that Powell and the diplomats at State lost this battle, and felt the need to get out their side of the story.  To the victors go the spoils, and the spoils here are the end of the Taliban and the Hussein regime in Iraq, less than two years after the epochal 9-11.  That Powell felt the need to make his case in this fashion speaks volumes about his relative isolation in the Bush White House.  It also is a bit of a sad commentary on the cautiousness of Powell, a fine man by all accounts.  Woodward and Powell did not have access to a crystal ball at the time of this book's publication, but the doomsday scenarios painted by the State Department for the most part have proven to be unfounded.<br />Bush at War provides insider information at a seldom seen level, and is a fascinating read, but, in the end, an incomplete look at one of the most pivotal moments in our nation's history.seen level, and is a fascinating read, but, in the end, an incomplete look at one of the most pivotal moments in our nation's history.	2003-05-06

'Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot' was an absolutely hilarious tome, and 'Why Not Me' was not far behind.  Unfortunately, this new book, while entertaining overall, just doesn't pack in the laughs as much as his prior efforts.

Verghese has that effect on you - a journal writer at heart, he brings out the writer in the reader.  I see far too much of myself in David - for those in the know, the ease of relapse is both understandable and horrifying familiar.  In the end, Verghese fails to understand the demons that haunt his best friend - but thankfully for him, this is due to a lack of walking in his shoes, rather than a deficit of compassion or intellect.  I can't say that this book makes me feel good - but it does impart valuable knowledge on a variety of subjects.

Unfortunately, Toobin has taken his cue from Paul Begala, James Carville, and their ilk and decided to take on Ken Starr instead.  The book is rich in detail and undeniably entertaining, but Toobin just doesn't seem to get the magnitude of the President, having sworn to defend and uphold the constitution of the United States, swearing falsely before a Grand Jury. In addition, the single most important fact of this whole ordeal is completely absent:  that is, the fact that any man of honor would have resigned his office in the wake of such scandalous behavior.	2001-10-16

So why should you read it?  First, the characters - Selby has drawn each of the four participants in this race to hell with stunning precision - after reading the book (and seeing the largely faithful movie) you feel as if you honestly know these people.  Second, the terrifyingly accurate portrait of the downward spiral of addiction.  Each of these characters reacts differently to his/her being hooked, but, with the exception of Sara, the brutal truth finally becomes too evident to ignore, at least until the next &quot;little taste&quot;.  The isolation of the addict is brilliantly rendered as Sara declines to go out, Tyrone gladly says goodbye to his &quot;fine fox&quot;, and Harry and Marion lose the intensity of their love for each other to their more urgent love of heroin.  Finally, it is Selby's gifts as a storyteller that provide the main reason for this book's classic status - I have read &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; before, but never have I been so riveted by it.  The final 50 pages or so just go by in a horrible blur.  Don't expect a light at the end of the tunnel - Selby doesn't celebrate dreamers, he condemns them for obscuring their view of what is with delusions of what could be.  Powerful stuff.	2001-09-10

The second half is the story of the murder trial(s) of Jim Williams, one of Savannah's most interesting residents.  The second half is much more interesting than the first.  Perhaps that is because every time Williams makes an appearance, things turn interesting very quickly.  (Having seen the movie, I can't picture Williams without thinking of the remarkable Kevin Spacey).  One character who draws a lot of attention in both the book and the movie is the Lady Chablis.  In the movie she occupies far too much screen time - her role in the book is much more reasonable.  I suppose the popularity of the Lady is due to her &quot;exotic&quot; nature as a drag queen, but I find her character to be pretty unremarkable - it seems faintly ridiculous to complain that she could be any ol' drag queen, but realistically, she adds nothing to the story of any substance.  I wish more attention had been paid to the &quot;occult&quot; aspects of the story - the title seems to invite this scrutiny.  The fact that an extrememly wealthy Southern man on trial for murder puts more stock in voodoo than his defense lawyers IS remarkable.  I found myself wishing Berendt would have questioned Williams at length as to the reasons he chose to believe in these supernatural powers.  Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil does a great job of transplanting the reader into &quot;Old South&quot; Georgia with enough colorful characters to keep the interest level high; it's just a shame none of us will ever get invited to one of Jim Williams' Christmas Parties.	2001-08-15

In any event, it is truly a delight to read the sections with Simpson on the stand, stumbling over his own lies, equivocating, spinning, and making it up on the fly.  The arrogant celebrity murderer is exposed from page 1 for the truly despicable jerk he is.  The O. J. Simpson case is somewhat unique in that closure was needed for not only the victims' families, but for the millions outraged by the unfathomable criminal verdict.  I am happy to say that Petrocelli gave the Goldmans and the Browns a little of that closure, and with this book, he provides some for the rest of us as well.  Required reading for those still angry about the trial, or, God forbid, anyone who still maintains Simpson's innocence.  Too bad this is out of print; grab a copy if you can.	2001-07-30

When it comes to political humor, I would have to rank Franken up there with P.J. O'Rourke on the other side of the aisle.  What I like about Franken, as opposed to such incredibly unfunny people as Molly Ivins and Jim Hightower, is that he expects the reader to have enough intelligence and wit to &quot;get it&quot;; there is none of that cornpone crap you get from Ivins and Hightower that makes me wish they were from anywhere but my home state of Texas.

Overbye also does a good job of at least attempting to explain relativity to a lay reader, while also not ignoring the other important works of the young Einstein on Brownian motion, gravity, etc.  I do find the title more than a little misleading, though - Einstein's marriages to Mileva and Elsa and his dalliances with others seem to have little connection at all with the progress of his scientific thought.  I suspect that the title is little more than a device to capture attention and sell books.  I also find it odd that the book just seems to end for no apparent reason around the time of his divorce from Mileva.  Still, if you want a good read about a true genius and his early life and works, this is one of the better places to turn - just don't expect much &quot;scientific romance,&quot; except for the beauty pouring out of Einstein's head.	2001-07-16

The narrative carries the story forward, rather than the philosophy, and a great narrative it is.  Rand manages to encompass almost all of the dreariness and paranoia of Stalinist Russia by following the lives of three young people involved in a love triangle of sorts.  We the Living explains why Rand took such &quot;harsh&quot; stances in favor of capitalism - she lived the alternative, and found it repugnant in the extreme.  Highly recommended.	2001-07-13

Hitler's crimes, ghastly though they were, seem born from a misguided sense of being slighted and unrecognized for his &quot;genius&quot;, whereas Stalin seems to be the textbook example of a psychotic sociopath whose paranoia knows no limits.  I am reminded of a scene in Martin Scorcese's &quot;Casino&quot;, where the mob bosses are discussing the fate of an associate.  They go around the table, talking about what a stand-up guy he is, he would never crack, he's done a lot for us - then its time for the last boss to speak.  &quot;The way I figure is - why take chances?&quot;, he says, and just like that, the associate is as good as dead.  Stalin took this one step further, it seems - to have even known him or any of his associates in any capacity whatsoever, or for that matter, to even be a well-known person in any field, seemed enough to warrant a death sentence.  The writing and narrative are strong throughout (I particularly enjoyed the account of the end of Beria, the child-molesting deviant) and Radzinsky keeps a strong moral compass without becoming preachy.  If anyone, anywhere is still under the misconception that there was something romantic and glorious about the Russian Revolution, please read this book and disabuse yourself of your delusions.  Highest recommendation for this one.	2001-07-05

Simpson	Books	5	15	19	N	Y	Definitive Account of a Double Tragedy	Here's hoping this one comes back into print soon.  Toobin presents a nice narrative here, with plenty of the juicy inside stuff, without losing sight of the two tragedies that occurred:  the horrible, bloodthirsty slaughter of Ron and Nicole, and the acquittal of a clearly guilty murderer.  If anyone out there seriously still believes in O.J.'s innocence, it's time to check out of Denial Land. The cynical playing of the race card is detailed thoroughly, as is the star-struck way that Ito handled his courtroom.  Toobin is not blind to the mistakes of the prosecution, but he sees equally clearly that &quot;Guilty&quot; was the only possible verdict a juror could have reached (I don't know what the twelve people empaneled in this case were, but jurors they most definitely were not). Toobin has an eye for the telling detail, and his writing skills make this a sometimes fun, sometimes sorrowful, journey through the most unjust trial of modern times.  Highly recommended.	2001-06-19

Any discussion of her work needs to take into account the fact that her then &quot;radical&quot; ideas in such areas as free markets and the primacy of the individual over the collective are now accepted as the Gospel in most parts of the world.  Quite a bit of credit for this is due to Miss Rand - and if you think that's giving her too much credit, consider that Alan Greenspan used to sit at her feet (no doubt Mr. Greenspan would repudiate parts of her philosophy, as do I - no matter.  You don't have to be in 100% agreement with someone to acknowledge their brilliance and influence).  Atlas Shrugged was to be the summation of Objectivism, in which Ayn poured out all of her arguments in the form of a speech by her ideal man, John Galt.  Did she succeed?  Well, at last count, there were over 600 reviews submitted on this item - compare that with almost anything else on here.  People will be loving and hating this book for as long as the printed word is around.  To those that hate it because it can be a little flat in characterization, and because her love scenes are flawed, I ask that you give her credit for her courage in attempting to define a philosophy through a novel.  To those that hate it precisely because of the philosophy, I will echo Miss Rand and say &quot;check your premises&quot; - a surprising number of her arguments remain impregnable to refutation, at least any logical refutation.  This is the kind of book that can inspire 20-page reviews, but bottom line - you don't have to be a &quot;true believer&quot;, nor blind to the sometimes flawed writing, to appreciate that Atlas Shrugged is a book about ideas, and it continues to challenge each new generation (and give quite a few people some renewed purpose in their lives).	2001-05-23

A coworker left a copy at my job and I picked it up out of curiousity.  What a find!  Hilts writes well and incorporates a wealth of knowledge into the tale of a man who had his memory removed.  Far from a tale of amnesia, this is an exploration of the inner workings of the brain, but even more, it is a testament to the power of memory.  Indeed, Hilts makes a strong case that memory is in fact the quality that makes us most human.  At times moving and disquieting, this slim work fires the imagination and changes perspectives.  I hope, if you've read this review, that you will give this book a shot - it deserves a wider audience.	2001-05-18

Keegan took three great battles - Agincourt,  Waterloo and the Somme - from three distinct eras and concentrated on the &quot;fog of war&quot;.  In other words, we don't get the feeling of great generals commanding heroically the pieces of a chess game, but rather are with the pawns as they are bounced cruelly about from life to death, from defeat to victory, often without discernment of where they are or how to seize an advantage.  Keegan doesn't shrink from the carnage, nor does he dwell on it - he deals with it as the price or perhaps the definition of war.  Subsequent Keegan works, although excellent all, have a hard time living up to this one; perhaps this is because he could only surprise us once with his knowledge of the military and his ability to alter perspectives.  After that, we all expected it.	2001-05-04

Such a thing, of course, will never exist except in the minds of those who are completely ignorant of writing.

Smitty sets out to tell the tale of the forgotten Patriot League, and the final inglorious season of the Ruppert Mundys.  As the other reviewers have noted, this is high farce - sometimes too broad, sometimes too cruel, but often hilarious.  I can't quite recommend this as highly as some of the others (for the record, I am not a baseball fan and I think it definitely would be funnier if I were).  However, there is enough talented wordplay for me to give this four stars.  Not Roth's best, but far from his worst.	2001-05-02

I knew very little about urban planning, New York City politics, or public works.  Caro handles the subjects so thoroughly that the lack of familiarity mattered not at all.  Moses was obviously a giant of a man.  He accomplished great things and made colossal blunders; he was a man of great vision who was blind to the effects his policies had on the less fortunate.  The contradictions are laid out in full detail in this monster of a book.  It is hard to comprehend the work that Caro must have put into this book;  it stands as the definitive biography of Moses and the textbook of urban policy in America.	2001-03-07

True, the story is about the mind-boggling little riddle Fermat left for posterity, but the concepts and personages introduced go far deeper.  Singh also has the good sense to know when the advanced mathematics have left the reader behind, and paints the final modern stages with a much broader brush.  Still, enough of the early efforts are explained in such detail that the reader can still grasp the main ideas behind the complex equations.  Fermat's Enigma is a great read, and a good history of one devilish proof, but it is also a great overview of mathematics.	2001-02-21

Rhodes tells a riveting story, astonishing in its complexity, yet he still manages to explain the concepts without talking down and to convey a sense of expectation one would expect from a spy thriller.  Each contributor to this massive achievement is fully fleshed out, and the overall effect is to make the reader want more, more, more.  The book holds up very well to additional readings as well, and as a non-scientist, I find that each time I read it I understand a little more.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.	2001-02-16

The authority is no less than Gilmore's own semi-famous brother.  The abuse that Gilmore's questioners were sure was there is indeed laid out in heartbreaking detail.  In the end, though, questions remain - what was real in Bessie's remembrance of ghosts and demons? What was the terrifying secret that Frank Gilmore kept from his family?  The fact that these questions remain unanswered, however, only serves to reinforce that life is usually a lot more messy than fiction.  A troubling book with darkness at its core - read it, but learn from it.	2001-01-31

The simplicity of the writing is beautiful; Mailer stays out of the way and lets the story tell itself.  This is more than a book about a crime; it is the story of people and how they relate to one another.  There is great distance and extreme closeness, and there is evil and stupidity and poignance.  This book leaves an impact on the psyche.  If you have not read it, you are missing out on a landmark.	2001-01-11

Unfortunately, although the intelligence and cleverness still come through, the narrative is just not that interesting this time around. Most of Eco's work can be read and re-read, and still remain delightful. I struggled to get through this one just once. Here's hoping for better next time.	2001-01-05

For anyone caught up in the illusion of the glory of life in the fast lane, the second half of this book, dealing with Belushi's last great binge in minute-by-minute detail, should be a real eye-opener. Woodward paints a balanced portrait of a much-loved, charasmatic individual trapped by his own demons.  Alternately fascinating and horrifying, this is perhaps the best celebrity biography I have read. I sincerely hope it comes back into print - if not, I suggest you try to hunt a copy down; it is worth your time.	2000-12-27

Spencer has crafted the beginnings of a classic, but in the end, weak characterization of some of the minor players and too many unresolved loose threads left me a little disappointed when all was said and done.  Still, the book is a quick, enjoyable read, and does contain many thought-provoking ideas and concepts.	2000-12-09

Rob's second chance with Laura took me by surprise with its feeling of real tenderness.  As a 32-year-old, I am undoubtably at just the right age to share Rob's doubts about the validity of a young man's judgments, but I think I would have found something meaningful in this book at any age.  There's definitely a big step between what people like and what they are like; I suspect Rob has become a man when he reaches that realization.  May we all be so lucky as to have a Laura to give us a chance to grow.  The best work of fiction I have read in many a moon.	2000-12-02

Touched on is a good phrase, because this book is really a hodgepodge of &quot;resources&quot; taken out of context (context, Mr.  Marrs, look it up!) to support some very silly ideas.  The final chapters  dealing with the true &quot;Ancient Mysteries&quot; are laughable, and  would make a very bad piece of fiction, even.  This is not journalism, by  any stretch, but, if truly believed by the author, a sign of encroaching  dementia.  The only reason I give this two stars is it is entertaining in  stretches.	2000-07-30

I am a conservative, but surprisingly liberal on some social issues, so I  definitely not a member of Hillary's &quot;right-wing conspiracy,&quot;,  and I have a lot of respect for the office of the President, regardless of  which party is currently holding it.  However, I do believe that Clinton's  multitude of scandals, particularly the sordid Lewinsky affair, have  degraded the standards of the office, perhaps irrevocably.  Coulter's books  has strongly reinforced that opinion.  I am docking the book one star for  an offensive reference to assassination and the fact the Coulter is  sometimes a bit repetitive in her arguments (this book could have been  about 50 pages shorter with some tighter editing).	2000-07-24

Like Shelby Foote with his three volume &quot;Civil War - A Narrative,&quot; Schama has leapt beyond the realm of history into that of literature.  His characterizations of the major figures are fascinating, his judgments insightful, and his prose is a sheer delight.  Schama never loses sight of the true contradiction of this and all revolutions, freedom derived from the very real threat of violence.  The tragedy of the French revolution, he reminds us, is that each successive regime to take the reins of the state confronted the revolutionary violence which lifted it to power with incrementally harsher measures of &quot;control,&quot; culminating in Robespierre's Terror and the military dictatorship of Napolean.  Shama also draws with the greatest clarity the straw men which fueled the public's patriotism, whether the fear of foreign influence over the Crown, the succession of famine plots, each more wildly implausible than those preceding, or the paranoid hunts for those who &quot;betrayed&quot; the revolution, never mind if they were the inspirations for it the day before.  Shama never flinches from the brutality; neither does he shrink from portraying the humanity of the Revolution's participants.  Highly recommended to all readers; do not assume that a lack of interest in revolutionary France will prevent your complete enjoyment.	1998-06-03
