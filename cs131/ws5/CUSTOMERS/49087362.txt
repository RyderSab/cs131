It's not always true, but it is always fun, as fiction and autobiography blend to create a good read. Has all the sex, boozing and pathos that was typical of 1920s Paris as its been memorialized in literature, whether that's a good thing or not is for you to decide.	2004-07-07

I picked this book up randomly at the library, because the title was a bit odd for a novel- and boy am I ever glad of my penchant for quirky titles right about now! It led me to what is sure to be one of my favourite authors... that is, if this book is any gauge of Donald Harington's talents. <br />With colourful characters, humour from bawdy to book-learned, and an understanding of humanity and history I've rarely seen in a modern author, Harington's 'The Architecture of the Arkansas Ozarks' definitely is a masterpiece. In this book he traces the saga of the Stay Morons, focusing on the Ingledew family in particular. He uses architecture as a conceit to show how 'the great world spins forever round the ringing grooves of change' (paraphrasing Tennyson).<br />Just remember &quot;the base is heavier, the upper part lighter, and... the roof is pitched.&quot;	2002-06-26

Maybe on the surface, but this book is as dark and cynical as they come. When we first meet one of the main characters, Cuckoo, she is having a mid-life crisis, so she boozes it up and tries to drown herself. Fortunately she is rescued by Marcus, the object of every man's lust- and every women's, too! He even gets raped later on. Oh yes, how light & entertaining.<br />We also meet a miserable tyrant of a film director who speechifies on actors being clay, and him being the potter. This is a man who would stop at nothing for art. I won't say what he does but you'll see what I mean. At least Marcus puts him in his place. I was like \\"Yeah!~ You go boy!\\" Sure, all this is ample material for spoofing, but underneath there are some heavy issues being dealt with.<br />The same dark pattern can be seen in many of the other characters, such as the narcissistic, historically obsessed Archie, or Leni, whose guilt over her German heritage leads her to an odd kind of atonement for the sins of the fathers. Oh yeah, the ending is so positive and cheery... lots of hope there(note the sarcasm). An alright book, but certainly not one with a joyful message.	2002-04-02

Tryon takes the reader back to a time when everything was glamourous and there was something almost magical about the movies. But he then proceeds to tell the very REAL behind-the-scenes story of some leading ladies, who share a common thread in that they were all involved with the same man at one time or another. <br />This is the kind of book you can't put down. There's lots of melodrama, intrigue, sex... and even murder! Also some pretty funny twists, especially the first story. (If you read it you'll see what I mean.) Glorious camp! Five stars.	2002-01-27

The book, if read ironically, would be a weak satire, but I don't think this is what Sanders intended. Coming at it as a Christian potboiler (if that's even a genre), it starts pretty bad and proceeds to fall flat on its bottom. The (laughable) descriptions of the sex act were just plain creepy, and those inclined to religion will hate the way Brother Kristos fulfills every stereotype of the preacher who is a money-hungry, hypocritical zealot. I'm not a Christian, and even I found it to be uncalled for. <br />Basically, the book is a whole list of failures. Put every category out there- narrative, characterization, dialogue, language- and all are found to be lacking. This was my first and last venture into the world of Lawrence Sanders, and if you're smart you'll never pick up his fiction to begin with. Zero stars.	2002-01-27

Woohoo!) Dripping with irony and a cool sensibility, the first-person narration of Kenzie, our modern-day Marlowe, is stellar and true to the genre. Like Chandler, Lehane is also an expert at unique descriptions and uses similes that either make one chuckle or marvel at their imagery. The language used almost makes the violence romantic. I say almost, because Lehane shows the reader violence in all its gritty realism- no glorifying what should never be glorified- but somehow the way it's described is poetic enough to be savoured and read over repeatedly. Kinda like the martial arts films where they make fighting look like ballet.<br />The theme of racism in the book bordered on preachy, but the elimination of moral superiority and self-righteousness saved it from being a wretch-inducing sermon. Lehane has a very good grasp of the victim mentality and handles abusive relationships very realistically (not surprising, since he counsels abused children), which is to be praised, because in the wrong hands, victims can become a cliche and like the race issues, make one wretch at the flat, cardboard characterization. There's no sense of the author having thought to himself &quot;I'll create a token abused person (interchangeable with token gay and the token minority) character for my series! That oughta pull their heart strings, and maybe another 1% of the population will identify because they've been abused (or gay, or a minority). Look at me, expanding my market. Making me some more dollars.&quot;<br />Corruption, violence, one-liners, pain, politics- this book has it all. This was my first foray into the Kenzie/Gennaro novels, and without a doubt, this is one series I'm definitely gonna keep on reading.	2001-11-02

Eliot is a valuable book, both for those who are not familiar with Eliot and for those who are but just devour all the information about him that they can (like me). This is a very slim volume, about 100 pages, and divided into five sections. The first section gives the reader a brief biography of Eliot, just to lay out the landscape. The second section progresses into Eliot's beliefs both spiritual and literary, giving one an idea of the issues he was most concerned with and which therefore influenced his poetry. The last three sections deal with the poems themselves, first giving an overview of Eliot's style and common themes in his work &amp;etc., then getting more in-depth with the individual poems. As always with Frye, there are many outstanding insights, some I've never heard or read anywhere previously, and others I have, but never quite understood till he explained it in that coherent way he explains everything- then it all finally makes sense! This book has added to my pleasure of reading Eliot moreso than any other introduction or collection of essays on Eliot has. Those psychoanalysts and post-structuralists have done Eliot a disservice by their attempts at criticism and biography- the way they write about him makes him sound so prosaic and unappealing! Frye obviously knows his subject well, and he writes about him in a lucid, engaging, unpretentious fashion, helping the reader grasp concepts in Eliot's works which would otherwise prove daunting. Everyone who loves Eliot needs to own this book. Also, if you're a student struggling to understand Eliot, do yourself a favour and find this volume! It is out of print, but you may be able to purchase a copy on the 'net. If not, your local library or used book store may have it.<br />One final note: this book is not necessarily helpful if you're looking to understand a specific poem of Eliot's and that's it. This is more of an overview of Eliot's poetry and a study of its evolution, or as one reviewer put it: &quot;Frye's study takes a more holistic view of Eliot's career; and it's especially successful in relating Eliot's literary theory to his practice and various works (written in different periods) to each other.&quot;	2001-10-12

The story is told in a series of flashbacks, tracing Gloria's life and loves, and then taking the reader forward to the present to examine how her experiences have shaped her as a person. There are many metaphors and symbols running through the book, such as The Faerie Queen parallel and Sir Thomas Wyatt's poetry as a relfection of Gloria's inner life (Gloria is an Eng. Lit. major in college, so there's a lot of bookish stuff going on here). The novel is well-written and has that vraisemblance that makes the reader feel as if these characters are living, breathing souls. Even the characters who don't have that big a part in the book are written in such a realistic style. Maillard knows what it is to be human-- more specifically female(!)-- and he showcases it finely in this book. I loved it and will definitely be reading more of this gifted author's books.	2001-09-29

It alternates from boring the reader to making them cringe at the pathetic attmepts Kroetsch makes at creating patterns, meanings and symbols that transcend character and place. This is the kind of junk that young hacks churn out in creative writing class, and it also seems like it was written with academia in mind. It has all the requirements to meet an English Lit. course's criteria; it can be picked apart and would serve to teach students about different techniques and literary devices, although they could (and should) learn from much, much better authors. This book is dangerous and it sucks, while most books in Canons of literature don't. Also, the devices used to give significance to events are so blatantly out in the open it's as if he just threw together these elements with no concern for story whatsoever- going by the guidelines of one of thse &quot;how to write fiction&quot; books, as it were. (By the way, you should avoid those books at all costs if you're serious about being a writer...they homogenize your vision of the world and inhibit your originality, and you'll end up writing junk like Badlands.) <br />How this got rave reviews I don't know- how it even got published is a mystery to me. The author seems to be lacking any sort of warmth and understanding of humanity; his characters are flat and don't act as human beings would. This is probably the work of a cold pseudo-intellectual who thinks the world revolves around him and has no concern or compassion for his fellow humans. Considering how the protagonist of this novel is a man who fits that description, I wouldn't be surprised if Kroetsch is what I've pegged him to be. Either that, or he's just a hack who got a lucky break. Maybe he knew the right people, or paid them off, or he slept with the publisher or something. <br />Not a rewarding book. If you have to read this, I feel for you. If not, avoid at all costs!	2001-09-27

I had trouble putting it down, the writing was just that taut and suspenseful. Although I don't agree about whodunnit (I think it's the surgeon guy who went nutso...a guy never mentioned once in this book) and I was pretty sure of who Ellroy would have it turn out to be from early on (although that could be due to the fact that I read too many mysteries and can guess pretty easily) I did thouroughly enjoy this novel. I don't know much about the Dahlia's background, so I can't comment on the accuracy with which she was portrayed, but I will say that I did find the story Ellroy wove out of Elizabeth Short's life to be fascinating either way. The one thing I didn't like was the psychologically overdone Lee- can you say cardboard? But you're allowed one lousy character in a book full of great ones. The dumb cops were a hoot, and all that manly man stuff had me in stitches (the interrogation room beatings and the phallicly charged gun-toting).

I skimmed thru it, and my first impression was that it was a pulp novel from the 40's. I was mistaken. What this book actually is is a couple of days in the life of a doctor who performs open heart surgery, and also has an open &quot;humanistic&quot; heart himself- hence the title. He seems like a pretty nice guy, but he's not that great of a prose stylist, and the whole cybernetics angle was rather dull. I don't know that I'd recommend it for an engaging read; I'm only giving it 3 stars because the intent was good and the doctor's compassion and feelings were at times expressed very well; there were moments when I got a glimpse of this man's soul and felt he was writing from his &quot;open heart&quot;. But these points in the book are few and far between, so you might want to pass this one up. It's out of print anyhow. Not surprising.	2001-05-07

This book is rich with some of the most fascinating observations on love in general and homosexual love specifically. The flower metaphor at the starting of the book is particularly clever. Proust has more of a sense of humour than usual in this volume. Around the middle of the book this is especially evident; there is more sarcasm, irony, and wit throughout than in other volumes. I found myself highlighting many passages as I was reading, and oftentimes just one sentence of Proust's work is enough material to write a whole book on! His observations are so loaded and so true that they can be stretched out a long way before they've been used up. I find myself constantly in awe while reading In Search Of Lost Time; Proust was so gifted in so many ways that it's a privilege to read his writings!

With 'Ulysses' and 'Finnegan's Wake,' man, have you ever got to work to make sense out of what you're reading! I don't mind the work, but it's hard going and takes much time- time that I don't have right now. So, until that day when I do have time, I'll have to content myself with 'Portrait...' I don't know about most readers, but Joyce's semi-autobiographical novel reminded me of 'Of Human Bondage' in many ways. You know, guy comes from religious background; he's shy, broody, and inclined to a love of words; there are 'moments' when he begins to appreciate the aesthetic; there's talk of hell and the protagonist worrying about being a sinner if he falls away from the church...and so on. So if anyone out there found 'Portrait' difficult, try 'Of Human Bondage'....ya might find that it's your cup of tea. To abuse a word, for me, 'Portrait...' is a book of 'moments'. There are scenes that are brilliant, almost magical; and then there are scenes that border on the pretentious. Overall, it is worth reading, because these moments are worth the fodder you have to read through to get to them.	2001-04-03

I found that it was empty and devoid of meaning, but written in such a way as to make you think there was some sort of meaning behind it. Nabokov just threw together some very 'deep' thoughts and had the protagonist use irony to appeal to the sardonic in all of his readers.

With his brilliance, wit, and keen observational skills, he weaves together one unforgettable story of mistaken identities, colourful characters and superb irony. This book had me bursting out into uncontrollable peals of laughter (but then again, what Evelyn Waugh book doesn't?) time and time again. This is, simply put, a work of genius-- no doubt of that. Evelyn Waugh will forever remain one of my literary heroes. If I could only write half as good as he did....	2000-12-10

It's very rooted in Eastern philosophy and is in many ways opposed to the western views on death. Westerners tend to view death as a failure or an embarassment and not as the natural course of things, like the Easterners do. This novel parodies the insincere, uncomprehending views on death that many of us hold. Davies also brings things into perspective on a larger scale by tracing Gilmartin's (the dead protagonist) ancestors, from his great-great-great grandparents up to his parents through a film festival of sorts, helping his spirit to realize what death, life, and the 'hero-struggle' really means in the long run, or the never-ending now. If anyone found this book underwhelming, it may be because Davies did not explain the character's development for the reader in clear terms, assuming perhaps they were bright enough to catch it on their own. It takes more than a little bit of thinking to get this book, and I've been doing a lot of that since I finished reading it. Davies has taught me a lot, and I highly recommend his fictions to any and everyone.	2000-11-04

He wrote with such realism and truth, he was so dead-on right in almost anything he said, and he managed to convey important lessons and wisdom, sometimes without you even realizing that you were retaining these valuable pieces of information. Nightmare Town, a collection of a variety of his short stories has a few brilliant selections, a few average ones, and yes, even a few not so good fictions. The title story is one of the strongest in the book, and the Continental Op stories-- my favourite ones in the book overall-- are above-average as well. Even the stories that aren't all that excellent usuallly do have a good punchline at the end-- contrary to what those not in the know believe, Dash Hammett did have a great sense of humour, and if you read carefully enough, you'll be amazed at the wit and irony you'll find. Even though this book doesn't do him the best justice and others are superior to it, this collection is great for the non-fan as well as the Hammett lovers. Bing, bang, boom-- 5 stars!	2000-10-24

From the first page, this novel does what all Chandler books do-- transports you to a whole 'nother world, so real it feels like you're actually there. FML is such an awe-inspiring accomplishment for the immensely talented man of letters, Raymond Chandler. Most of the time I was absolutely floored, just sitting there with my mouth wide open, marvelling at his genius. Writing is hardly ever this good, and when it is, the great stuff usually isn't the abundance of the book (as RC's is), rather, it's in little snippets here and there. There must be a God, because Chandler's writing makes me realize the potential of us humans to transcend the ordinary and be what he is-- extraordinary. Not to mention that the mystery will have you guessing all the way through, and even without the cynical prose (yes, I said prose) which manages to be beautifully ugly and positively negative at the same time (I told you he was a genius), is excellent in of itself. So, I urge every person who hasn't yet done so to read Raymond Chandler. He is not just a mystery writer (which usually means sub-standard literature) but he totally, without a doubt, transcended the genre. I guarantee his writing will blow you away. His clever, cheeky remarks, his sarcasm, his minimalistic prose, his cynical outlook, the dames, the coppers, the criminals-- that and more is what you can look forward to in this masterpiece of the English language.	2000-09-30

It is very well-written and the descriptions of people and places are so vivid as to just jump right off the page, taking you along for the ride, to experience the ups and downs of Ms. Winterson's life along with her. It's one woman's realization of her Unnatural Passsions (her mother's name for homosexuality) that are in no way acceptable in the Pentecostal church. The scenes based around this particular aspect of the novel add an ironic tone, which I love. Wit and wisdom can be found throughout the book, making &quot;Oranges...&quot; at times a very thoughtful read.  The only flaw in this book, as others have stated, is the awkward fairy tale bits that just didn't seem to belong there at all. Other than that, it's a heartfelt semi-autubiographical novel of a gay woman (though this is by no means a &quot;gay&quot; book...I'm straight and it made not one bit of difference to my enjoyment of it) and also a great humourous look at religion and all of its contradictions and excesses.	2000-09-22

It's nonetheless worth  reading, and as a woman, reading Thompson is such a treat. I get a lot of  flack for saying this, and many women disagree, but his female characters  are amazing. I just love them all. They're so brilliantly written, and  besides the fact that his books are based on Greek mythology (ripping off  the classics is a tried and true way of writing a great story) that's the  main reason why I read him. This book is no letdown in the awesome babes  department. Two very unforgettable criminal-type women inhabit the pages of  this book.	2000-09-13

The Thin Man, Dashiell Hammett's high-society detective novel, is most  definitely NOT like the movies based on the book. While the movies are  about a gay, carefree couple who solve crimes and do a lot of social  drinking, the book is more about a couple in a destructive relationship.  Nick only married Nora for her money, and they both know it. He's also a  womanizer and an alcoholic (as is Nora). Nora is a younger woman who seems  enchanted by Nick's sinful ways, and allows him to use her as he feels free  to. The whodunit mystery, although discussed very much in the book, is not  the most interesting part of the novel, nor did Hammett intend it to be.  Read it for the satirical potrayal of bad relationships. Not just Nick and  Nora's, but the dysfunctional (although dysfunctional may be an  understatement) family they help to solve the murder. <br />The Thin Man is  also notable for the use of a certain word to describe male arousal.  Hammett was attempting to pave the way for other authors to discuss  sexuality more openly. Unfortunately, it didn't quite catch on.	2000-09-13

Although he's never turned a  tale anything but excellently, this is somehow more endearing than most. It  starts out normal enough, with a man who just became an earl (Reginald,  third Earl of Havershot) going off to Hollywood to save his alcoholic  cousin from the deadly drink. He meets an actress by the name of April  June, the very embodiment of virtue, on the way there-- or so he thinks. He  also runs into his ex- finacee, whose engagement to him he bungled by way  of a little accident with a cigar. After some very cold ice cream, he needs  to have a tooth pulled. In the dentist's waiting room he meets little Joey  Cooley, the child actor, Idol of American Motherhood, who will be  undergoing the same torture as him. Well, both souls get administered some  laughing gas, and this gives them the ability to be masters of the art of  astral projection. But the thing is, little mischevious Joey puts his soul  into Reggie's body, rather then his own. Reggie then has no choice but to  inhabit the body of the child star with the golden curls. Now we've got a  dilemma. See, Joey wants to poke everyone in the snout, and in Reggie's  body, now has the strength to do so with optimum results. Uh-oh. And now  Reggie is left with the mind of a grown man, but the mean Miss Brinkmeyer  (the &quot;tall, rangy, light-heavyweight, severe of aspect' woman with  whom he shares a mutal hatred...animus is in the air) and all other of  Cooley's keepers, who treat him like the eleven-year-old child they think  he is. Double uh-oh. <br />This book is one of the funniest things I've ever  read, not only because Wodehouse is a master of the English language and  shows such a conatagious affection for it, but because it's a very zany  tale that never fails to make you laugh and keep a smile on your face all  day. There are so many more hilarious moments in this book, and not a page  goes by without a good, hearty chuckle. I would highly recommendthis book  and all of Wodehouse's books, for that matter.	2000-09-08

All of what Joanna Russ writes about rings true with me,  and at the same time I wished it wasn't so. I've always known what she says  to be as it is, but I just accepted it, and didn't really give it much  thought.

A good read, and also it makes really cool  noises when you scratch it (hardcover). I read the book, and when my eyes  got tired, I played Classic Rock on the book jacket. <br />Maybe I'm reading  too much into this, but could Skink be the antichrist? There are a lot of  parallels in Hiaasen's books that would indicate that it might be the case.  After all, religious scholars say the antichrist is in human form here on  earth and is a militant environmentalist. Supposedly, eating roadkill would  fit the description, too. Antichrist is supposed to not kill animals  himself, but has no qualms about eating those which are already dead.  That's my belief, and it is a bit bizarre, but it makes reading Hiaasen all  the more fascinating. Well, if not, the scenarios in his books (which are  filled with the type of events that would potentially be leading up to the  second coming and Skink himself), are eerily similar to what religious  scholars believe to be true.	2000-09-06

This is such a funny book, but underneath all the satiric and wickedly  evil humor lies a truth so awful that it may be hard for you to face it.  The story is told with all the subtlety of being hit by a Mack truck at  high-speed. This novel was surely no easy feat for Waugh to write. _Vile  Bodies_ is crafted in such a brilliant and many-layered style, and still  communicates it's deep underlying message very clearly, so even those not  looking for a hidden meaning will see the truth. The scathing wit and utter  absurdity are the veneer that once penetrated, will take you to a place  deep in your mind that is all too real. Buy this book and take a second  look at life.	2000-08-11

And the unbearable nature of it all wakes Eddie  up out of the complacency of his life. That's what this book is about. Not  to mention that Goodis' writing is like reading hard-boiled poetry. The  words flow together beautifully and have an air of mystery and profundity  about them. The last two pages alone will stay with me forever as a fond  memory.
