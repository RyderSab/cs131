She is one of the six great creators whom I believe wanna-be comic book writers and artists MUST study if they are to truly contribute to the genre, whether they like manga or not. However...<br />I found myself dissapointed with &quot;The Art of Ranma 1/2,&quot; eventhough it confirmed what i already knew to be true. (That's why it gets 3 Stars... it's a good book, but...)<br />Rumiko Takahashi is, first and foremost, a cartoonist. This is very clear in her &quot;The Art of Ranma 1/2.&quot; This book of paintings culled from a variety of sources, such as video covers and pin-ups and posters from the 'Ranma 1/2' series' original run in a Japanese anthology comic book are pretty, but they are nothing special. Takahashi's talent shines when it is applied to panel art rather than single illustrations.<br />&quot;The Art of Ranma 1/2&quot; is only of interest to hardcore &quot;Ranma 1/2&quot; fans... but if you're one of those, it's a must-own. Takahashi offers a range of insight into the how's and why's of the series and the illustrations in an interview and through liner notes. But, as an art book, it should probably be passed on.	2001-11-01
US	51631888	R1QGJCXEQIGDRQ	156971178X	670836733	Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Still one of my &quot;expanded universe&quot; items	One of my fondest memories of Star Wars--fonder even than watching the first movie--is coming upon Russ Manning's &quot;Star Wars&quot; during its run in newspapers. While I can't really quibble with the other reviewers opinions, I think he's being a bit harsh; the style in this volume is classic newspaper story telling, although somewhat redited for the Dark Horse volumes as were all the reprints of the newspaper strips.<br />Yes, I can't argue that the Al Williamson/Archie Goodwin run on the strip was more in line with the overall thrust of the LFL expansion of their Star Wars property. However, there is a charm and an excitement in the Manning strips that is not present in the slicker, longer storylines that followed.<br />The tale of Leia and Luke struggling to convince a planet that specialized in the manufacture of starfighter weapons components and the ultimate space battle against Darth Vader and a Star Destroyer, not to mention the mysterious Blackhole who had been charged by Vader to hunt down the Rebels, were among the elements that made up my first long-form writing efforts, fan fiction. I can trace a line directly back to those efforts and that strip and my current career as a writer. Boba Fett's appearance in the final section of the book--created by Alfredo Alcala and another artist after Manning left the strip for health reasons--also sparked my imagination and inspired a love for the character that exists to this day. Boba Fett's appearance here remains my favorite in the Expanded Universe.<br />I recommend others take a look at these classics. Who knows? Maybe you'll be inspired as I was.	2001-11-01

RPG and Resource Book	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Excellent RPG and fan resource	Guardians of Order continues to produce top-notch books that work well whether you are a gamer or just a fan of the cartoon series that they are adapting/describing.<br />This release describes the &quot;Tenchi universe&quot; as it appears in the original animated series (and the follow-on, excellent graphic novels), and it does an excellent job of describing the characters, the setting, and the storylines. The simple and versitile game mechanics that are featured in all Guardians of Order anime adaptation games once again do a cracker-jack job at simulating the characters and action of the series.<br />The selection of images from the animated series are also reproduced with excellent quality. (I faulted an early effort from Guardians for its murky reproductions--I have no such complaints to offer with this volume! The full-color pages and stills are stunning to look at!)<br />I recommend this book highly, whether you're a gamer or just a Tenchi fan. (Heck, I recommend this game if you're a gamer who's never heard of the Tenchi franchise; this book is chock-ful of ideas for a lighthearted science fantasy setting/game.	2001-11-01

Demands on my time and thoughts of more responsible ways to spend my money almost caused me to stop buying the &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; graphic novels with &quot;Terrible Master Urd.&quot; The ending of that book was so perfect that I almost didn't want to have it ruined by knowing what came next.<br />Boy, am I glad I chose to stick with the series. <br />&quot;The Devil in Miss Urd,&quot; the latest installment in Kosuke Fujishima's hilarious and touching &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; romantic comedy series continues to establish new high marks for quality in the series.<br />The storyline of this installment once again takes a turn for the darker as Urd's evil half is exploited by the demonic Mara, partly as another scheme to drive Belldandy back to Heaven but also simply to return to the friendly relationship she enjoyed with Urd when they were kids. Mara being Mara once again fails to fully consider all ramifications of her plan... and the resulting *two* Urds may both die before the story is over.<br />Fujishima's characters and their relationships continue to evolve in this volume--with Belldandy and Keiichi taking a backseat while Mara, Urd, and Skuld step into the spotlight. The art is, as always, the gorgeous mix of cartooniness and realism that Fujishima becomes increasingly adept at. In fact, I place Fujishima in the same class as Masamune Shirow--a writer/artist whose style should appeal even to those who don't general like &quot;anime&quot; and &quot;manga.&quot;<br />&quot;The Devil in Miss Urd&quot; may not be the best point for those unfamiliar with the series to jump on though... that would be &quot;1-555-Goddess,&quot; even if Fujishima's art is a bit rough in it. Other good choices would be &quot;Ninja Masters&quot; or &quot;Miss Keiichi,&quot; the two volumes immediately preceeding this one. But, if you have even a passing familiariaty with the characters of the &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; series, I give &quot;The Devil in Miss Urd&quot; my highest recommendation.	2001-08-15

'Maison Ikkoki' is a romantic comedy that focuses on Godai, a young man who falls in love with the manager of his apartment building. The manager is Kyoko, a young widow who is still recovering from the loss of her husband, her first and (so far) only true love.<br />The series follows the development of Godai and Kyoko's relationship, as it is threatened by romantic rivals, the general weirdness of the other residents of Maison Ikkoku, and misunderstandings that, if featured on sit-coms, might actualy make them worth watching. The readers also get to follow the emotional growth of Godai and Kyoko, both of whom really have a lot of maturing to do when the series starts.<br />'Maison Ikokku' consists of 14 volumes. As with all of Takahashi's work, the art is pleasing to the eye, the characters are all likable, and the humour is genuinely funny. Some elements of the story grow out of Japanese culture, but the characters are developed enough that the reader can nonetheless relate to all their reactions, viewpoints, joys and heartbreaks.<br />Pick up Vol. 1 today, follow the series through to the end. It's a great story... and you get to watch Takahashi's style evolve as well.	2001-05-22

In Vol. 4, we get to 1942 when all the elements finally congeal into the stories that still stand head and shoulders above most of the work being done in comics today, 60 years later. This volume is still not a 5-star effort, but it is an excellent read that is full of stories that holds up nicely six decades later<br />While Will Eisner's The Spirit has been reprinted multiple times over the decades, these DC volumes are the first time the series will be printed in proper order and in its entirety. It is fascinating to read these stories and watch as Eisner and his assistants find the format and styles that would make comic book history.<br />Although each 240-page volume sports a US$40 price tag, I think these are items that belong on the shelves of every aspiring comic book creator and any person who fancies themselves a serious fan of the artform. Will Eisner's 'Spirit' series is where much of what we consider the basics for good graphic story telling was first used.	2001-05-14

With this, the fifth volume, they appear to have finally grown up. As an underscoring of that, this book is also the one that has the fewest fantastical elements, with the Skeleton Key not being used even one time.<br />'Roots' has none of the fantasy elements that were present in earlier volumes in the series--Tamsin refuses Kitsune's requests to go world-hopping with the Skeleton Key more than once, Mr. Racoon hardly does anything at all, and Kitsune all but gives up her magical nature and learns how to fit into the 'real' world of Garfield. <br />In some ways, the lack of magic makes 'Roots' a curious period at the end of the 'Skeleton Key' series. (I may be assuming too much, but this book felt like the *end* of the adventure.) On the other hand, it works nicely as a story about that stage we all have to face in our lives... the one where the kid stuff has to be set aside and we have to focus on finally mastering the skills we're going to need to survive outside &quot;the nest,&quot; not to mention LEAVING the nest.<br />However, the kid stuff never fully leaves us, and we can always return to it when the time is right. So, maybe, Kitsune and Tamsin will have more adventures in the future. <br />Whatever happens, Andi Watson delivered another nice read, with characters as charming as ever.	2001-03-28

First, let me state up front that I am NOT the Steve Miller who co-wrote these novels, so I'm not singing my own praises here. I AM a Steve Miller who's also a writer (and who may have chosen a different variant on his professional name if he had been aware of the other Steve Miller who also writes sci-fi/fantasy, but for now I guess we have to share... :) ), but we are two different guys.<br />With that aside, I'll just say that I greatly enjoyed &quot;Partners&quot; and that I hope to start &quot;Plan B&quot; (the follow-up novel) next time I have a trip I have to take. In fact, &quot;Partners&quot; is one of the most enjoyable books I've read so far this year.<br />Lee &amp; Miller write with the kind of style I wish I could. It seems breezy and effortless. Their tales are populated with likable characters whom the reader almost can't help but care about. The adventures are exciting, the romances touching, and the action fast-paced and exciting.<br />I highly recommend this omnibus of the first three Laiden Universe novels to anyone who enjoys sci-fi that's focused on characters rather than tech. The section about the 'hows' and 'whys' of this particular volume is also interesting reading.	2001-03-13

'Sam and Twitch: Udaku' is a graphic novel in the best hardboiled detective/police procedural/buddy flick tradition. It features a pair of supporting characters from the 'Spawn' comic book series, but there's nary a superhero or super-demon in sight--save for a brief but humourous appearance by Spawn himself. Instead, we have Sam and Twitch returning to the police force... and immediately becoming embroiled in their strangest case yet, while having to fend off crooked cops and I.A. officers with unknowable motivations.<br />Bendis has woven an excellent story with this work, and Angel Medina's art has come a long way since I first saw him working with Barry Blair on the Nightwynd line of comics. I still see some Blair-like influences here and there in Medina's work (not a Bad Thing... I was quite fond of Blair Aircel material years ago), but Medina is coming along nicely as an artist with his own style.<br />I've never been much of a Spawn fan, but this is an excellent graphic novel, and I'll be looking for future volumes. Sam and Twitch are a pair of nice additions to the crime genre. I would, in fact, have given the book Five Stars if not for some poor production value... sometimes, the dialogue (which is presented without the traditional comic book bubbles) get lost against the toned art, and at other times it is lost in the gutter of the binding. It's a distraction that pulls one out of the otherwise engaging read.	2001-02-20

However,  there is no question that later works produced after the creator found his  or her voice are far better from a pure entertainment viewpoint.<br />Volume  One of DC's &quot;The Spirit Archives&quot; is primarily interesting for  the glimpse into the evolution of master storyteller Will Eisner's grasp of  his style and craft.  There are some glimmers of the greatness that the  Spirit strip will eventually display, but from the jaded eye of 60 years  past, the stories in this volume are merely remarkable because they...  well, were 60 years ahead of their time.<br />Even in its earliest stages,  Eisner's &quot;The Spirit&quot; shorts were heads and shoulders above the  vast majority of its comic contemporaries and even much of what creators  are putting out today. Volume Two, which apparently won't be available  through Amazon until next month, even more of the gem that is emerging as  Eisner and his assistants continue to improve. The most remarkable thing  about the tales in that book is that even the ones that are very clearly  tied to the politics of the time (Spirit battles a number of facist agents  and even tries to convince Hitler of the error of his ways), remain  powerful and entertaining tales where many other such comic book adventures  fall flat when read today. Further, Silk Satin puts in her first couple of  appearances. She was nifty from the very beginning. :) <br />This is not the  first time a publisher has brought the masterful Spirit comics to light,  but it is the first time an effort has been made to print ALL of them, in  order. My hat is off to DC Comics for giving everyone the chance to enjoy  this cornerstone of American comic book history in its entirety. I hope  this venture becomes the commercial success it deserves to be... because I  want to own all 15 volumes of the series.	2000-08-18

Unlike the first volume, which contained mostly recent stories, this one seems to cover a range of  years, judging from the art styles. They're not all winners, but over all  this book is yet more solid evidence that Takahashi is a master of the  graphic story telling medium. Whether you're a fan of &quot;manga&quot; or  not, there's no denying that she's a skilled artist and writer who deserves  the accolades and success she has enjoyed.<br />Most of the standout stories  in the book are, sports-themed. 'Excuse Me for Being a Dog!,' (a young  boxer turns into a dog whenever he gets a bloody nose) 'Winged Victory,'  (the tale of a rugby team that's lost 999 games in a row and the ghost who  watches over it), 'The Grandfather of All Baseball Games' (a young man  plays hardball with his obnoxious grandfather), and the title story (in  which a kendo instructor is put in the body of the club's pretty manager)  all use sports either as the backdrop or motivation for the story and its  characters. The characters in these stories are Takahashi at her most  charming.<br />'The Diet Goddess' (about a girl who buys a dress with the  intention of losing enough weight to look good in it) and 'Happy Talk'  (about an adoptee who embarks on a search for her biological mother) are  two slice-of-life stories ala the majority of the shorts from the first  'Rumic Theater' volume, and the 'Maison Ikkoku' series. Again, Takahashi  presents us with charming characters the reader can't help but care about,  in stories both funny and touching.<br />Dissapoints in the book include 'To  Grandmother's House We Go' (about a pair of hardluck cases who try to  collect the large birthright of a deceased friend for themselves) and  'Reserved Seat' (a curious tale about a rock singer who is haunted by his  grandmother and Tarakazuka). The first story is simply too short and it  feels rushed on every level--the ending feels particularly  unsatifactory--while the second is the only Takahashi story I've read where  I felt no sympathy or good will toward any of the characters present in  it.<br />Finally, there's 'Shake Your Bhudda,' a tale that appears to be early  Takahashi, both based on the art style and the story's pacing. It's clear  she was still mastering her craft, and there's very little to recommend  this tale. In fact, I feel the book might have been better served if it had  been left out all together.	2000-06-14

From  one-on-one battles, to commanding armies, Conan stands tall in the book,  even when he has been beaten down by his enemies.<br />I ordered this book on  a lark, not expecting to like it that much. I'm in a tiny minority of R.E.  Howard fans... I'm not terribly fond of most of his Conan stories. But  'Hour of the Dragon' is a definate exception. It might be because Conan is  older in the story, and is a king who has responsibilities beyond his own  survival, but I found him much more engaging than in other tales. And so, I  am once again left awestruck by the fact that an author who was writing  over 70 years ago has yet to be topped by those who have been working in  the genre he more or less invented in the decades that followed.<br />This  deluxe hardback is a welcome addition to my library. I like it even better  than the other Grant edition I own ('Black Vulmea's Vengence') because the  colour plates are by an artist whose style is more to my liking.	2000-06-02

Near-future SF seems to be almost as hard to do well as fantasy. Too often, authors of both kinds of material rely on tired cliches or an assumption that a reader will fill in the blanks rather than taking the  time to create and then ground their story in a fully realized  world.<br />Thankfully, Peter F. Hamilton took the time in 'Mindstar Rising'  to fully introduce the reader to the 21st century world of Greg Mandel (a  veteran soldier turned trouble-shooter for hire) before launching his  characters into a thrilling mystery plot.<br />The end result is a futuristic  detective story that has heavy techno-thriller aspects and touches of the  fantastic, by the way of psionics and precognative abilities. Nonetheless,  it all makes perfect sense... and at no time does the reader feel like an  alien in the setting. This makes his already well-drawn characters even  more believable.<br />If more writers were willing to spend the time that  Hamilton spends on world-development, we might see non-media tie-ins  reclaim some of the shelfspace in the bookstores. We certainly need more  writers of Hamilton's calibre working in the science fiction and fantasy  genres!	2000-02-09

I like the Diane Tregarde books. I like the Valdemar books. In fact, 'Oathbound,' 'Oathbreakers' and 'By the Sword' are three of my favourite books by her. So, when I saw 'Oathblood,' I knew  I had to get it... it was about Kethry and Tarma, and, despite the fact  only one of the stories was billed as new, I figured they were *all* ones I  hadn't read before, as I don't read any of the magazines that had run the  short stories.<br />Well, now I understand why 'Oathblood' had such an  episodic feeling to it: Many of the 'chapters' are actually short stories  that have undergone little or no revision.<br />The high points of this  anthology were the first story (which details the events eluded to  'Oathbound'--the meeting of Tarma and Kethry) and the last story, the piece  first published in this volume. The other stories are either slightly below  par for Lackey, or were already presented in book form as part of  'Oathbound.'<br />All in all, I was dissapointed for the first time by a book  bearing Lackey's name. Perhaps she has fallen victim to what I call the  Stephen King Syndrome... where the author has seemingly become more  concerned with cranking out product that producing good, solid reading  material?	2000-01-23

This is one of the finest novels published as part of TSR's Ravenloft line, and Larissa Snowmane is  one of the most memorable figures created for the setting.<br />I liked  Christie Golden's take on Souragne and Anton Misroi so much that when it  came time for to rework the Ravenloft game setting for 'Domains of Dread'  that I made sure the land was reshaped to be closer to the novel than it  had been in previous presentation.<br />If you have an interest in dark  fantasy or the gothic horror genre, track down a copy of this book.

Out of the eight or nine books of his I've tried to read, I've only finished four and there were only two of these that I liked. <br />'On a Pale Horse' was one of them.

This is a title that works such as 'Ranma 1/2' and 'Maison Ikkoku' proves that she richly deserves. 'Rumic Theatre' certainly displays many of the touches  that her fans love, but it also shows that she is capable of creating far  more sedate stories that might well in some cases happen to those we know  our even ourselves.<br />'Rumic Theatre' is a collection of six of the finest  Takahashi stories that I've read so far. As always, the characters are  likable and engaging, the tender moments touching, and the comedy  top-notch. The stories are more down-to-earth than we are accostumed to,  dealing primarily with the trails and tribulations of everyday people--all  of whom are characterized in a believable and three-dimensional  fashion--but that typical Takahashi magic is still very clearly evident on  every page. What's more, the art in this collection is among the best she's  produced.<br />My personal favorites in this collection are 'The Tragedy of  P,' (which revolves around a pet penguin in an apartment building where  animals are absolutely not allowed), 'Hidden in the Pottery (where reality,  perception, and the dangers of gossip are examined), and 'Extra-large  Happiness' (where a young wife sees her future happiness endangered by a  gremlin that only she can see). The remaining stories are also of high  quality, but the characters and situations in the three mentioned above are  the ones that moved me the most.<br />Even those who don't typically  appreciate the 'standard' style of Japanese comics (embodied by Takahashi  and Shirow), you should consider buying this book. If you appreciate the  art of comic books for more than just slam-bang superheroics, you won't be  dissapointed.	2000-01-23

Grant produced this and other deluxe volumes of R. E. Howard's stories a couple of decades ago, focusing primarily on the ever-popular Conan tales. <br />Well, like the six volumes of the Bean  R.E. Howard Library (which, among other things, collected all the Bran Mac  Morn, Solomon Kane, and King Kull tales in single, affordable volumes),  Black Vulmea's Vengance collects a handful of Howard efforts that showed  that he could create heroes, action, and character interplays far more  interesting than anything found in his most famous stories.<br />Two stories  and the novella found in this volume can either be read as top-notch pirate  stories, or they can be read as typical Howard action tales. What *isn't*  quite typical Howard, though, is the presence of female characters that  display a bit more depth than one usually finds in his work.<br />Considering  the relative age of this book and the fact that I received a first edition  when I ordered it, I imagine that there are only a limited number of these  left. I urge all Howard fans, as well as those who appreciate well-written  adventure fiction, to order a copy. The price is definately right for these  fine, hard-to-find tales. The book would have received Five Stars if the  colour plates present had been better executed. They were the only  dissapointing aspect of this hardcover collection.	2000-01-20

I can't stand  obvious machine lettering!<br />My latest purchase was the Lum Urusei Yatsura:  Perfect Collection, I think 'Lum' is left in the dust by virtually  everything she has done since, even the stand-alone stories in the 'Rumic  Trilogy' collections. Takahashi's storytelling abilities and comic timing  have only improved over the years, as has her art style. <br />There are still  many laughs in Lum, and the prototypes for Takahashi's stable of characters  are all evident, but unless one is interested in seeing what her work was  like when she was still learning her craft, the Perfect Collection should  be passed up for more recent works like 'Ranma 1/2,' 'Mermaid Saga,' 'Inu  Yasha.' <br />The only benefit that I see in 'Lum... The Perfect Collection'  is that it's a cheaper sampling of early early Takahisi than 'Rumic  Trilogy'... although 'Rumic Trilogy' shows that she had a wide range even  in the early years.	2000-01-12

'Inu Yasha: A Fuedal Fairy Tale' is a perfect blend of the darker side of Takahashi we see in 'Mermaid Saga' and the more comedic antics of 'Ranma 1/2.' Sometimes, the events on the page are humorous and horrific at the  same time!<br />The series is split between fuedal era Japan and modern day  Japan, as the plucky high school student Kagome and the half-demon Inu  Yasha attempt to track down the fragments of a gem that grants demons  unlimited power, traveling back and forth through time via a magic well.  Their adventures are varied and the stories always  well-paced.<br />Character-driven and populated with entertaining and likable  characters who simply will not admit how much they actually care for each  other, 'Inu Yasha: A Fuedal Fairy Tale' is another fine series that those  who have liked Takahashi's other works should pick up as well.	1999-12-30

Howard's most famous creation, I've always enjoyed the stories of Kull a great deal more. The brooding man of honor at the helm of a decadant nation has always held more fascination for me than the  hack-and-slash adventures of Conan. If you like fantasy and/or pulp  fiction, you MUST read this book!<br />Don't let the awful movie from a couple  of years color your impressions of what these stories are. You'll find some  echoes of them on the screen, but their true power can only be found in  this anthology, the only place that I know where all Howard's Kull tales  have been collected.	1999-12-22
US	51631888	RZE39OI3Y6WMC	0671876953	101956842	Solomon Kane (Solomon Kane #1)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Must-have for any lover of dark fantasy and horror fiction	Solomon Kane's adventures are, in my opinion, among the best tales penned by R.E. Howard. None of his other heroes are as driven as Kane, nor as mysterious. The approach taken to the supernatural in these tales is also  far more clever... and the supernatural seems far more horrific as a  result. <br />This book collects all of Howard's Kane writings, including even  a poem that amounts to Kane's farewell appearance. It's a worthwhile  addition to the library of any lover of fantasy and horror fiction... more  modern writers in both genres owe more to Howard than most of them  realize.<br />On a final note, the 'fanboy' in me was particularly excited by  the Kull cross-over in one of Kane's African adventures... when our hero  stumbles into the final vestiges of the Alantean civilization!	1999-12-22

The four Robin Hudson books has prompted me to think of Sparkle Hayter as one of my favourite authors. Still, 'The Last Manly Man' didn't seem quite as entertaining as the previous books.<br />I guessed where Hayter was going  before she got there in most cases, and a good number of jokes just didn't  do it for me. Robin herself remained in true form, but the supporting cast  seemed a bit off... although I did enjoy learning that her neighbour wasn't  quite as crazy as she has seemed in previous books.<br />Still, I will be on  the look-out for the next Robin Hudson mystery, feeling confident that  Hayter will come back around to where she was with &quot;What's a Girl  Gotta Do&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Cootie Girls.&quot;	1999-12-20
