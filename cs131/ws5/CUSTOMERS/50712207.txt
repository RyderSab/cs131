Unfortunately, these types of girls exist, as do these types of parents. The writer took a big risk in this book - and it may put some people off but it is worth the time. I was hoping a bit for more of an epilogue - I was rooting so hard for these girls I really wanted to know how things turn out for them - you get some clues, but maybe there will be a sequel? I can DEFINITELY see this made into a movie. Love books that flip from past to present so well and this one definitely does.	2005-09-07
US	50712207	R3J98Q7AP10WQW	1400063833	97937991	Until I Find You: A Novel	Books	4	8	9	N	N	too long, but intriguing	I think the weird things that sometimes are 'off-putting\\" to a reader are overshadowed by Irving's incredible writing abilities. I so loved \\"the Wurtz\\" and \\"emma\\" and their character development  - there were a few too many \\"penile references\\" but I can honestly say I've never thought I would finish an 800 page book but I so wanted to know how Jack's life turns out. Things are definitely not always as they seem and this book proves that so many people, other than immediate family, are truly your \\"family\\" and provide your basic views of the world. It also shows that you can overcome obstacles including abuse if you are willing to find help and the truth. This book could have been 100 pages shorter at least, but it is so well written if you can get over the \\"slightly perverted\\" parts.	2005-08-22

Had so many funny parts & great characterizations of stereotypes of so many different types of women!! NOT for the faint of heart- but a great mindless escape for a vacation - loved it!	2005-07-19

If you read the \\"Kite Runner\\" and were moved by the journeys faced, this book will make the \\"Kite Runner\\" seem like a comedy. The journies these boys faced and the hunger and suffering they endured and mind-blowing. I truly believe that every teenager in America who is lazy & thinks they \\"have it so bad\\" should read about what these brave men endured to know how lucky they are to have a roof over their heads and live in this country. Well done, but very, very sad.	2005-07-19

Only problems - Burr put up with a lot - as the story progresses this will make sense to you. Also found the RoseMae character a bit unbelievable - she would leave someone in a tree with no explanation? Love the southern baptist portrayals. I would recommend reading this as close to \\"all in one sitting\\" as possible, as the author has flashbacks throughout the story.	2005-07-04
US	50712207	R25XZ46DTMFW7E	0743265025	288228634	The Starter Wife	Books	2	3	6	N	N	maybe 2 1/2 for the funny Will lines?	I have never read a book that mentions the main characters obsession with her weight more than this one. I was on vacation, totally open to \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" and all that, know it's a hollywood \\"summer read\\" and did finish it. However, it is pretty trite, the homeless person track was a bit over the top, and if this book in ANY way represents the shallowness of true hollywood marriages, then boy am I glad I live on the east coast. I have to admit, I did want to find out what happened at the end and LOVED Will, great funny lines for him. If it's there and you're on vacation, skim through it, if not, maybe try something else.	2005-06-02

Caught myself laughing out loud on the beach. And you really want things to work out for this character, appreciate her ability to confront the horrors we've all had growing up and then being single. Great book, really loved it. Perfect relaxing, but attention-holding vacation book!	2005-05-30

US	50712207	R8Q127MV42U76	0385511809	740331338	Saturday: A novel	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Very thought-provoking	I have never read McEwan before but heard good things & saw a pleasant interview on the Today Show. There are parts, like the squash match and the food shopping,that are a bit too tedious & detailed, but after finishing the book, you are definitely left thinking about it. I so admire his writing about his marriage and it's importance in his life. I disagree with the one reviewer's comment about the Mercedes - he is a humble person. So much to think about after and during the read - very \\"big picture\\" questions come to mind 24 hours after reading this. I would strongly suggest reading this in long sessions if time permits, I found it much more enjoyable to read longer portions at a time- not an easy book to read \\"scatteringly.\\"	2005-04-22

The parts about Holmes were intriguing - sad that in those days there was no technology/means of tracking vanished people. Sorry, the general concensus of our group was a thumbs down.	2005-01-25

I think that women who need to realize that \\"being married\\" isn't their sole purpose in life will find this book interesting. I didn't care for the way the younger sister basically gets away with something unforgiveable, perhaps that could have been dealt with more.....but really liked it.	2004-09-08

I knew it would be hard to raise one, but with the author's experience he gives an excellent picture of the far-reaching effects of an autistic child that the average person would never consider. And you want so much for him to be loved & accepted. Would definitely recommend this book! However, I disagree with Amazon's suggestion that if you like this, you will like \\"timetraveler's wife.\\" I just could NOT get through that very, very long book - did not hold my interest at all.	2004-09-08

I did feel for Gert and her friends were nice, but not quite as supportive and a tiny bit immature. I think there should have been a few more &quot;bad dates&quot; in this to make it more realistic. But I did enjoy it.	2004-08-03

I seriously think that anyone with as many hangups as Joy though with a delightful, devoted man like Gabe would have sought SERIOUS counseling to get over her issues. That was the piece that was missing. With so many people that loved her surrounding her in her life, someone that unhappy would have been forced into counseling. However, not to get to deep- willing suspension of disbelief prevails and it's a good chick book. The weddings are funny and it makes me SO JEALOUS that all of my girlfriends don't live that close and that everyone has to get a babysittter for us all to get together as often as these gals do!!! good beach read, but get it at the library, don't buy it.	2004-07-26

Only 2 gals actually finished it - it is VERY VERY long. I read about one half and just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Had to jump around a few times to remember how old everyone was. Maybe I just missed the boat, since a LOT of folks obviously liked it. But no one in our group really loved it.	2004-06-28

Some parts were funny - but we do wonder what her husband and children will think of down the road when they read her exploits with other men.	2004-03-01

It was interesting, well written, etc, and the writer's personal accomplishments in spite of her illnesses are amazing.<BR>I had heard of all of the &quot;historical perspective&quot; that I would learn about this era - - didn't see much of that at all in this book. It was ALL about horses and nothing else. The life of Red is a very sad one and the chemistry between Smith &amp; and the horse was really amazing. I just don't know that this book needs to be 300+ pages long.	2003-02-16
