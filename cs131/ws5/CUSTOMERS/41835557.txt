Dennie Hughes takes lessons learned from her own dating experiences and incorporates years of know-how as a relationship or should I say \\"relationtip\\" columnist for the USA Weekend to offer good solid dating advice that works.  However, if you are on your way out the door for your next date attempt, this is not for you.  \\"Dateworthy\\" requires thought before practice.  This book is ideal for women reevaluating current situations or starting from scratch.  The adventurous need not read.  My favorite subject matter is the reality check for the \\"Fractured Fairy Tales\\" where Ms. Hughes reviews the so-called myths taught to women from childhood about love and marriage.	2005-03-26

The pharaoh who slept in darkness and obscurity for 3000 years was still hidden under the sand in the Valley of the Kings. Englishmen Howard Carter along with the financial support of George Herbert, Lord Carnarvon would make Tutankhamun a household name and famous around the world.  <br />  <br /> It was Professor Percy Newberry who introduced eighteen year old Howard Carter to Egypt in 1894. Carter accompanied Newberry as a painter to sketch artifacts, but Carter found is purpose for living. Without university training he learned the skills of an archaeologist. He also learned to read and write hieroglyphics and the histories of the pharaohs. One pharaoh in particular called to him and that was the undiscovered Tutankhamun.  <br />  <br /> Lord Carnarvon an adventurer himself and never one to back down from a challenge suffered terrible injuries in an automobile accident. Later, he was advised to spend his winters in Egypt where the climate was more suited to his condition. It was there that he developed a taste for excavation and sought Howard Carter. <br />  <br /> For several years Carter searched the sands only to discover trinkets. It was believed that the wealthy amateur excavator Theodore Davis had previously exhausted all the treasures to be found. Davis even claimed to have found a cache of Tutankhamun without actually finding the pharaoh. Although frustrated, Carter pursued what was in his heart and soul. On 4 November 1922, Carter's team came across a staircase leading down into the sand. On 24 November, Carter reached a door with a cartouche reading Tutankhamun. But the discovery would be a joy and a curse.  <br />  <br /> Carter's discovery produced international interest and excitement beyond measure. Government officials, journalists and visitors from around the globe demanded access to the tomb. The battle ensued. Together Carter and Lord Carnarvon would face the climate of World War I, Egypt's National Party, the Antiquities Service, illicit antiquities dealers, the Abd el Rassul clan, Prime Minister Saad Zaghlul, the Egyptian press, envious Egyptologists, a host of self-important nobles, and thieves. The discovery of the century that should have produced scientific and artistic enthusiasm instead produced pettiness, lies, betrayal, corruption and jealousy.  <br />  <br /> This incredible true story is brought to life by Christian Jacq.  <br />  <br />	2004-07-26

In the 17th century B.C. the Hyksos used horse drawn chariots and other advanced weaponry to conqueror and begin a one hundred year occupation of Egypt forcing its people into slavery and oblivion.  From the beginning twenty year old Queen Ahhotep along with her husband the Pharaoh Seqen devised a strategy to retake Egypt.  Now, Queen Ahhotep is thirty nine, her husband Seqen murdered and her eldest son Kamose is Pharaoh.  <br />Headquartered in Thebes the Thebans along with a loyal cast of supporters such as Afghan, Moustache, Qaris, Moon, Emheb, Heray, Neshi and Ahmes begin the second wave of attack following the lead of Seqen.  With a sizable well trained army and a swift sailing fleet they head for the impregnable Per-Hathor to the south.  They continue following the Nile south to conquer Elephantine and Buhen in Nubia facing the military might of King Nedjeh of Kerma.  Victories in hand the Thebans head north toward the Hykos capital Avaris in the Delta.  Along the way they retake Kebet, Qis, Abydos, Dendera, Nefrusy, Khmun, Sako, Faiyum, and Memphis getting all the way to the gates of Avaris.   There is only one problem for the Thebans there is a master spy among them.<br />The Pharaoh Kamose after taking the port of Avaris is forced to retreat.  Returning to Thebes it is found that Kamose has been poisoned and dies at the hand of the unidentified spy.  <br />For the Hyksos Emperor Apophis there is Khamudi the self serving perverted High Treasurer only interested in furthering his wealth, Jannas the brilliant military Commander who seeks Khamudi's ruin and presides over the massacres of innocent Egyptians, Windswept, Apophis' sister, who is one of his many secret collaborators, and Aberia who strangles victims with her bare hands and commands the new prison camp inSharuhen.<br />Jacq's writing is so vivid and imaginative.  I feel like I am right there in the mist of it all.  I feel the power of the magic in the ancient rites performed to provide guidance to the Egyptians.  Jacq takes historical fact and makes me live it.	2004-05-11

Religion...Fascinating Tale	After reading the \\"DaVinci Code\\", I was curious to read another work by Dan Brown.  \\"Angels &amp; Demons\\" was even faster paced with more action and more suspense.<br />Robert Langdon, Harvard Iconologist, will experience the most harrowing 24 hours of his entire life.  He will discover HSCTs-High Speed Civil Transports (Boston to Geneva in just 64 minutes), visit the famous CERN in Switzerland, find proof of the secret society the Illuminati, discover antimatter, and unearth a plot to destroy the Vatican.<br />Maximilian Kohler, director general of the CERN (Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire) contacts Robert Langdon immediately following the murder of CERN physicist Leonardo Vetra.  What makes this murder so mysterious is the ambigram burned into the chest of Vetra.  It is a symbol for the ancient Galilean brotherhood known as the Illuminati.  Kohler needs Langdon's input on the situation.<br />It seems that Vetra along with his physicist daughter Vittoria made a scientific discovery-antimatter- the most dangerous energy source known in the world.  Now Vetra was dead and the antimatter canister was missing.  The Illuminati which has promoted the interest of science versus blind religious faith has carried it to Rome and to the center of its ancient rival the Vatican.<br />On the eve of a papal conclave four cardinals are suddenly missing.  They have been kidnapped to become sacrifices to the Church of the Illumination (the Illuminati lair).  One cardinal will be killed each hour starting at 8 pm until Midnight when the antimatter will explode somewhere beneath Vatican City.  Each cardinal will be branded with an ambigram at one of the four markers in Rome leading to the Illuminati lair.<br />Langdon and Vittoria Vetra begin a frantic search against the clock for clues leading to the markers among the vast amount of Roman churches to find the four cardinals before its too late and locate the antimatter before it incinerates Vatican City. <br />Brown incorporates many historical facts along with fiction to make a very interesting and entertaining story.  I found myself interested in the workings of the Vatican, art history especially Bernini, Galileo's work and the concept of the ambigram.	2004-04-25

Known as the Egyptian \\"Joan of Arc\\", Queen Ahhotep led the resistance that would restore Egypt to its former glory.  Mounted with a new weapon of war the horse-drawn chariot the barbarian hoard known as the Hyksos lead by its Emperor Apophis would invade Eygpt and subjected it to a century of despair and slavery.  <br />A rich and prosperous country Egypt had known tranquility until the 18th century B.C. when it experienced its first major foreign invasion by a collaboration of peoples known as the Hyksos.  The Hyksos were able to overrun Egypt by using an animal unknown to them at the time called a horse.  In addition, the Hyksos used wheeled chariots that could carry up to four soldiers during battle and threw bronze-headed spears.  Turning the Egyptian populace into slaves, the Hyksos displayed unfathomable ways of torture and cruelty bleeding the land dry of resources and wealth.  With its military headquarters established in the Delta city of Avaris only the small island city of Thebes remained free of the ruthless tyrant Apophis's reach.   Thebes under the rule of Queen Teti the Small was seen as unchallenging to the occupation.  Unable to lead the battle of resistance herself her eighteen year old daughter Princess Ahhotep took up the reigns.  Now as Queen Ahhotep established the resistance that would return freedom and reunification to Egypt.  By her side in battle was her husband the Pharaoh Seqen-en-Ra whose head was horribly disfigured during an attack in war.  Queen Ahhotep preserved the Pharaoh Seqen's memory of bravery by having him mummified without removing traces of his wounds.  <br />This is the first volume of the Queen of Freedom trilogy.  Queen Ahhotep's sons Prince Kames and Prince Ahmose continue the battle of this true history.	2004-03-31

It will leave you guessing at every turn of the page.<br />Dan Brown's character Harvard symbolist Robert Langdon goes to Paris to give yet another lecture and becomes involuntarily involved in one of history's greatest mysteries...the Holy Grail.  What is it truly?  What does it mean?  And how does it affect the outcome of all that the world has come to \\"believe\\" as fact?<br />The curator, Jacques Sauniere, of the Musee du Louvre in Paris is murdered, but this is no random killing.  This man happens to be the Grand Master of the secret society known as the Priory of Sion.  Established in 1099, this organization is bound to secrecy in the preserving and location of the Holy Grail which has been sought for centuries.  After being shot in the museum, Sauniere uses his own body; Da Vinci's encrypted artwork, and his avid use of code to pass on clues to his granddaughter Sophie Neveu in locating the infamous keystone which leads to the Grail.<br />Robert, who is falsely accused of the murder, teams up with Sophie who happens to be a Police Cryptologist.  Becoming suspects on the run through Paris the two must play detective.  In deciphering Sauniere's clues they come across a box for which they have no idea what is inside.  What they find is what is called a keystone.  Who ever wanted this keystone is behind not only Sauniere's murder, but three other murders that same night of prominent members in the Priory of Sion and a nun.<br />Their adventure leads throughout Paris, to Westminster Abbey in London to the Rosslyn Chapel in Edinburgh, Scotland.<br />The keystone holds a two thousand year old secret that can change the fate of all.<br />This book is a true mystery from start to finish.

Initially, I wanted to read this book to learn about the history of the Ottoman Empire, but I learned how Allied forces reshaped the geographical as well as the political landscape of this ancient area of the world.  This book provides a detailed history of the so-called \\"development\\" of the Middle East beginning in 1914.  By 1922 France and Russia as well as Britain had drawn dividing lines separating frontiers, established states and appointed leaders of their own choosing to govern.  Today the Middle East is still conflicted from this inherited time.  <br />By 1914 a quarter of the globe was under the British Empire's (King George V) control while a sixth was held under the Russian Empire (Tsar Nicholas II).  The western hemisphere fell to the United States (President Wilson).  After the European nations had divided the continent of Africa, it was looking for a new frontier to conquer and the only one remaining (other than Asia) fell to the Ottoman Empire.   In the mists of World War I the Ottoman Empire led by a Sultan and the Young Turks Party aligned itself with the German Empire against the Allied Forces of Britain, Russia, France, Italy and eventually the United States.  Ultimate defeat of the Germans led to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire by the Allied Forces with Britain imposing its imperialist designs over all.  <br />Britain especially believed that the people of this area not only wanted, but needed to be governed by them.  They would become Protectorates of Britain.  Their occupation had destroyed the indigenous political structure.  Instead Britain proposed a leadership under European design such as the use of Kings.  However, the annexation of the Middle East brought forth a foe that European leaders could not foreseeor comprehended.  Islam.  The hold Islam had over Arabic and Turkish speaking people was beyond measure.  Uprisings were quelled by European armored vehicles and airplanes.  Forces unknown to dessert people who still fought hand-to-hand combat and traveled by horse or camel.<br />Winston Churchill who understood that modern war toys required oil to function was the first to realize the importance of this region for its valuable oil reserves.  Now, this region was more important than ever.  <br />Colonialist Britain faced many revolts for independence in the Middle East starting with  Egypt in 1918, Afghanistan in 1919, Arabia, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Eastern Palestine (Transjordan), Mesopotamia (Iraq),  and Persia (Iran) in 1920.<br />This book also addresses the ideology behind Zionism and Palestine.	2004-03-07

This is not a mindless book of senseless drivel.  This is not a typical autobiography.   Sting has quite a memory.  I can barely remember what happened yesterday.  He incorporates in great detail the many specific good and bad adventures of his childhood and young adulthood, the numerous people, relationships and emotions that formed his outlook on life and the musical influences that make him what you hear today.  \\"Broken Music\\" comes from a term used by his grandmother to describe the horrific sounds he made on her piano.  Do not look to read about all of Sting's known successes.  He focuses on the days before stardom hit.  Sting is an intelligent soulful man regardless of fame.

Since then, I have purchased many of his other books.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  If you want to feel closer to God in a modern sort of way, seek Max Lucado.	2003-12-03
US	41835557	R24FGSP66YENI3	0553208845	36215520	Siddhartha	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	A Journey Towards Spirituality	Although written in 1922, Hermann Hesse's \\"Siddhartha\\" is still poignant.  Siddhartha, a young man, is the son of a Brahmin (a Hindu man of the highest caste traditionally assigned to the priesthood).  However, Siddhartha is not interested in pursuing this avenue for himself.  He wants to contemplate Self (life).  He does so by becoming an ascetic for several years then decides that he needs to experience more of life.  He turns to seek out all the pleasures of life.  From one extreme of life to the other Siddhartha comes to realize that a true life seeker cannot accept the teachings of others if he wishes to learn something himself.  He learns that true seeking is having no goal, finding means, being free and being receptive.  He realizes that wisdom is not communicable.  It cannot be taught.  Only knowledge can be taught.  In addition, truth has two sides (yours and mine), life is an illusion (things do not make you happy) and time is not real (life continues into death).<br /> \\"Siddhartha\\" will make you appreciate life.  You will find that in order to appreciate happiness you have to experience sadness.  The things that others claim make you happy will only bring you grief.  Happiness is what you make of it.  Accepting life is the road to peace.	2003-11-27

The story revolves around a North Carolina couple named Wilson and Jane Lewis.  Jane is the daughter of \\"The Notebook\\"'s characters Noah and Allie Calhoun.  Wilson and Jane are on the threshold of their thirtieth wedding anniversary.  In the story Wilson becomes enlightened towards his behavior or lack of towards his wife during their marriage.  In being a provider he has neglected his wife emotionally and spiritually.  He wonders why or even if she's still in love with him.  He desperately tries to reconcile his ways.  Instead of trying to improve his wife, he tries to improve hisself.  He takes full responsibility for all his actions.  If you are familiar with Sparks, you will know the end way before you get there.  However, it won't stop your curiosity.  The love story is wonderful, but it's one that is hard to come by in real life.  Most women will probably have a copy of this in their favorite man's Christmas stocking this year.  Men could gain some helpful hints about what women would like to experience in their relationships.	2003-11-18

Russians from all walks of life were arrested at random on bogus charges to be cattled into the gulag system which in turn provided millions of men, women and children for slave labor.  The Russian economy took into account how many prisoners there were available.  If there was a shortage, more were merely arrested.  There were more &quot;reasons&quot; for arresting someone than for not arresting them.  This provided the logic behind the whole system.  For example, a group of brothers were arrested for winning a soccer match because they defeated the favorite team of the NKVD (a.k.a. KGB) leader.  Prisoners were tortured (for false confessions), beaten, starved, frozen, raped, mutilated, traded, and deprived of humanity.  Being killed or dying was the least of one's problems.  This truly is one of Russia's biggest historical secrets.	2003-11-09

Because you will want to continue your reading immediately after you complete this one.  Everyone has heard the stories about Kleopatra and her life.  Karen Essex takes those stories and writes them in a way that you feel you are there actually observing it.  Kleopatra (spelled in the Greek version) was the most powerful woman in the world during her time.  She put no limits on her life or ambitions.  In a family (the Ptolemies) that merely used Egypt as a playground Kleopatra focused on its greatness.	2003-11-09

Once a great admirer of Stalin's, Khrushchev became known for the &quot;Khrushchev thaw&quot;.  A time when things reversed themselves from what Stalin originated.  Stalin had been a monster to his own people and Khrushchev was afraid of him.  Khrushchev had convinced himself that Stalin was doing what was best for the people at the time.  Through sheer luck (or whatever you want to call it), Khrushchev was spared from Stalin's purges and there were 20 million who were not so fortunate.  For a man with little education, little cultural experience, a very short fuse and a loud mouth he became the successor of Stalin and leader of one sixth of the world's population.  His relationships with Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy as well as Chairman Mao are addressed.	2003-11-09
