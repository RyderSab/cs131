But it's a lousy attempt to pull the wool over the reader's eyes; it's unethical and almost unforgivable that neither the author nor publisher have admitted to the book's fictional status, as of October 2003. As a fictional account, the book carries many of the expected traits - child abuse, fatal illness, family strife, all of which are fine in their fictional surrounding.  The problem comes from the fact the book is sold as an autobiography, a memoir, a journal.  It's none of these;  it's a work of pure fiction, with not a single word of truth in the entire sordid journey.  We the public are more than happy to read both fictional tales and autobiographical volumes, but we do at least deserve to be treated with respect;  this is sadly lacking when a fictional author releases a fictional tale which is then poorly disguised as a true-to-life memoir.  <br />Read it if you want to peruse a &quot;what might have happened to someone, at some point, somewhere along the line&quot; tale.  But don't believe that it's a true account - it simply isn't.	2003-10-16
US	51791731	R3A9US4CCDMYPZ	0451205553	634041775	Trauma	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Inconsistant	The premise here is very, very effective - a woman who cleans houses after trauma scenes and thus deals with horror on a daily basis; and whose own frustration will eventually and inevitably reach boiling point.  Her personal life is difficult, with a lecherous boss, a selfish, belligerant oaf of a husband and a son who seems to be following in his father's footsteps - and herein lies one rather large error.  In the beginning, we're told the son is 17, yet further into the story he is referred to as being only 15 years old - no explanation or reasoning, just a simple mistake, it seems. Remarkably enough, this is the second title I've read by the author that's contained such a glaring error. There are also grammatical and typographical errors, but these reflect more on the publishing house than the author, in all fairness.<br />Having said that, Masterton does write a very good horror story, and &quot;Trauma&quot; is no exception.  We're sympathetic with the downtrodden and frustrated protagonist, and we can completely empathise with her situation.  The storyline is a very effective study on the horror we sometimes bring upon ourselves, and there's just enough gore to satisfy the demon in us all.<br />3 stars, as I would have actually liked the story to be longer!	2003-04-19

Yeap, it's all of these.<br />If there weren't a few glaring inconsistencies, this book would've garnered 4 stars. The first (and most screamingly obvious) is very early - we're first told the main character has been married for 7 years (\\"when she'd married him 7 and half years ago\\"), then a few pages later the same character remembers her wedding and honeymoon, FOUR years ago. Sure, it's possible (but not plausible) that the honeymoon happened 3 years later; and really it's only a minor niggling point. If you can get past that, there's a strong chance you'll enjoy the rest of it.<br />Anyway. The story IS creepy - Celtic mythology is a hobby of mine, and this book included intriguing glimpses of both traditional Irish culture and the mythology contained therein. There's a good steady amount of suspense, some graphic scenes of deliberate violence and a hint of sex that makes quite a nice package in all. Unfortunately, I'd figured out the bad guy by about halfway through, and I'm certainly not a genius...there's also a subplot involving the main character's spouse that seems to have no purpose other than to flesh out (pun intended) the main storyline. There are a couple of technical and historical inaccuracies too, which do detract from the credibility a little.<br />All in all, it's not Masterton's best offer, but it's certainly not his worst, and it's a fun read that'll occupy you for a couple of hours.<br />3.1/2 stars out of 5 :)	2003-04-18
US	51791731	R3URS91CLIEVWU	0451204123	161070434	The Association	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good old horrifying fun	I don't expect much from horror books, admittedly. Basically, my criteria are \\"scare me, make it quasi-believable, and don't mess up the ending\\". With that in mind, \\"The Association\\" rates a not too unhealthy 4 stars. What is particularly enjoyable is Little's trademark ability to take the mundane and twist it around until it becomes the horrifying. Sometimes, it's what we're familiar with which provides the most terror...<br />Maureen and Barry have left California, to reside in an upper class \\"gated community\\" in Utah. With idyllic views it appears to be the paradise for which the couple yearn. But not for long.<br />When the couple bought their new property, a condition of purchase was that the couple must agree to, and comply with, the community's \\"Homeowner's Association\\"'s rules and regulations. And this is where only real criticism comes in - I found it so unlikely that *anyone* would purchase a property without having (at the very least) a real understanding of the purchase conditions...and more likely, the help of a lawyer to translate the legalese. Anyway - the couple neglects to read all of the fine print, and not long after they move in the trouble starts. To begin with, the Association/community restrictions are petty annoyances - no loud music, no pets, rules about the appearance of the property and so on. But as time goes on, the restrictions become more demanding and people begin to disappear after disagreeing with The Association, and Barry and Maureen begin to suspect something far more sinister is at hand.<br />Of course, they're right!<br />And that's really as much as I want to give away. The story basically follows Maureen and Barry's experiences at the hands of this warped and dangerous Homeowner's Assocation. We're treated to little spurts of graphic violence, nicely intermingled with paranoia and outright terror. There is sympathy for the main characters, and just the right amount of outrage at the sheer nerve of the Association's enforcement of their rules. <br />All in all, it's a good read. The only other criticism would be towards the legal side of things - there is simply no way a Homeowner's Association would be allowed to get away with *that* much without intervention, no matter who (or what) was controlling the picture. Having said that, if you can get past the obviously unfeasible bits, it's well worth a few hours of your time.<br />Nice, scary stuff - and readable in an afternoon or two.	2003-04-05

Whilst his own conclusions don't always follow \\"fairness in journalism\\", it's important to remember the nature and context of the content, to begin with.  <br />In particular, I found the chapters relating to child kidnapping, and teen suicide, both enlightening (in terms of factual evidence offered - I had no problem actually tracking down the references and checking myself), and frightening (in terms of what the media WOULD have us believe instead of facts).<br />Glassner also covered the breast implant scare very thoroughly.  Again, I was able to source some (but not all) of the reference material myself, and confirm the reality of the situation, in it's own context.  Because I'm at a distinct advantage having worked on both sides of the drug and clinical trial industry, I found myself being particularly judgemental on the material covering this topic, but Glassner did a very good job in showing how even government agencies (the FDA) can have their hands forced by anecdotal and media-invented \\"proof\\", where clinical evidence was largely ignored.<br />In other chapters, the pervading message that \\"It's the guns, stupid\\", whilst well-intended, often misses the mark - as we know, there's a large (if not the majority) number of would-be criminals who would use a knife or other weapon if guns weren't available.  The tool doth not the crime maketh.<br />The bottom line is, we ARE living in an age when the media can and will use it's force to breed and support stories and misleading statistics, which sadly often take anecdotal stories and portray such as \\"truth\\", when the truth is often quite, quite different.<br />I gave the book four stars - it's really somewhere between 3 and 4, but there's no \\"half star\\" counts.  So, four it had to be.  Absorb it, use your own common sense and resources, and above all...don't believe everything you see on TV.	2003-03-21

Misleading \\"facts\\", emotionally-based opinions and very little else - which is really a shame.<br />I'm a European ex-pat, living in the US, and I was present during the election debacle. Yes, we KNOW it wasn't exactly \\"above board\\"...and yes, we know that the family ties linking the President to various self confessed extreme right wingers are stronger than steel...but Moore could have (and should have) chosen a much different formula in getting his message across, and some of the blatantly misleading facts he offers are something I'd expect from a 10th grader - not a respected journalist.<br />Sadly, the book reads like yet another \\"Stupid White Man's\\" pity party, and fails to give a solid or even factually accurate representation of the US.<br />I gave this book two stars - because in some places the material has great comedic value.  But if you're looking for an accurate critique of the nation, save your money.	2003-03-07

This should never be forgotten or ignored when discussing obesity.<br />Also, the author's sources are sometimes taken out of context, and in other examples simply not present at all.  As an example, on p.56 she talks about a woman who \\"was allegedly told by her doctor that her obesity prevented pregnancy\\".  There is actually more truth to this statement than is conceded to by the author (estrogen is stored in fat cells; the more fat cells you have, generally the more estrogen you have in your body, and unopposed estrogen is a leading cause of anovulation), but this is never addressed.  Another example is on p.64, when Poulton cites \\"20 deaths...within the first 6 years...\\", referring to the introduction to the US of liposuction. What she fails to mention is the context - how many procedures were performed in this period?  Is that 20 deaths out of 200 procedures?  2400?  24000?  It's inconsistencies such as these which demean the author's credibility somewhat.<br />Having said that, the book does highlight the very unhealthy obsession with weight-loss that is now pandemic.  Interestingly (to me at least), the book was written only a year before the diet drugs Redux and Pondimin were taken off the market, after being found to cause significant heart valve damage (along with PPH) - I would be very interested to see an updated issue of the book, if only to see if this is addressed adequately.<br />Do try to obtain a copy though - it's informative for the most, andit's an important book.	2003-01-18

One reviewer mentioned he'd lived across the hall from some 'sluts' he knew, who were \\"nice people\\".  His attitude is actually half of the problem, but that's by the by.  Onto the book.<br />Emily White has given us an exercise in pinpointing the dangerous clique society that engulfs our schools and encourages seperatism and prejudice.  The mentality behind labelling girls as \\"sluts\\" is fairly well discussed, and the author did actually hit a raw nerve with me, as I was one of those girls was *was* labelled.  With that in mind, this review is admittedly biased.<br />I did appreciate the conversations with other \\"sluts\\", and I would love to see this book as required reading in schools everywhere.  Perhaps the most startling thing about this book though, was the author's actual attitude towards these \\"sluts\\".  On one hand it was sympathetic, and justifiably defensive of the whole stigma, but on the other hand, all too often it appeared that White was actually part of the problem, in her use of labels.  Maybe I misinterpreted it.  Regardless, it's an important book that's very accessible to a wide audience, and would be a great addition to any teacher's bookshelf.  We can all learn something here.	2003-01-12

But that shouldn't be a surprise, or a hindrance - it IS the \\"TIBETAN Book of Living and Dying\\", and not the \\"Generically Believable For Everyone, Book of Living And Dying\\".<br />With that in mind, I loved reading this book.  From the first page, I was drawn into a world where compassion and mindfulness reign, and it's these tools that will help us face the inevitable truth that we *are* all going to die, at some point.<br />Rinpoche skillfully shares his own wisdom, that of many other masters, and anecdotal evidence of what may happen when we physically die, and the stages we may go through during the process.  <BR>Topics discussed include the Bardo states, reincarnation, the concept of karma, and fear of the unknown.  The book is very readable, and covers the material therein with sensitivity and warmth. At times, it may be difficult to the average Western mind to grasp the concepts of such things are reincarnation - but as Buddha himself did advise, the goal is to read, absorb and take what YOU find important from the lesson...not to read blindly and accept everything blindly.<br />To anyone even vaguely interested in Buddhism, death and dying or simply becoming more aware of their own self, this book is an invaluable addition to your library.<br />Truly a classic.	2002-12-20

Thich Nhat Hanh once again delivers simple, yet hauntingly beautiful words that reach into your heart and provide comfort and wisdom.<br />Within the first 10 pages, I found myself crying tears of relief - finally, I was able to understand how my anger is created, why I feel that way, and how I can work towards embracing anger so that it does not remain a destructive force.<br />Using simple, accessible language, we're taught how to understand different types of anger, what causes our anger, and how we can both embrace and release our anger, thereby encouraging peace and happiness. It's one book I wish I could buy for every person I know. I keep going back to re-read certain passages, and every time I read, I gain a new insight, a new understanding.  Particularly, the &quot;peace treaty&quot; was a beautiful idea, and one which I did find extremely helpful.<br />Included are meditations and practical methods one can use in times of stress and angst.  The book does include some Buddhism-specific ideas and lessons, but that should not disuade the non Buddhist from reading.  We can ALL learn from this wonderful wisdom.	2002-11-15

Books	4	11	12	N	N	Wonderful, simple advice	A great little appetizer, filled with flavourful pieces of advice and snippets of common sense that we can all use in our daily dealings with the world, most of which are taken from Buddhist sacred texts.<br />One wonderful example of this is, &quot;What would Buddha do about that coffee habit?&quot;, to which the response is: &quot;Our country is full of sickly-looking, skinny people, just because we don't drink tea. Whenever people feel weak, they should drink tea (Kissa Yojoki)&quot;.  In that simple piece of advice, we're told both a common sense and medicinal answer to that coffee habit (the author tells us that tea is healthier than coffee, which is truthful). The author expands on the passage, giving a short interpretation of the lesson including &quot;...When we have to have something, the truth is that thing has us. Ask yourself who is master, who or these things you 'need'.  If it's not you, something is wrong&quot;.  It's passages such as this that make us stop, and think &quot;oh yeah...&quot;.<br />To a serious scholar of Buddhism, this book may lack substance and true contextual meaning, and may leave the some readers gasping like a fish out of water, reaching for a more substantial main course.

Written in very simple English, so that even the most inexperienced student of Buddhism (that would be me!) is able to understand, this book describes eloquently, and with a sweet and simple passion, the key concepts of Buddha's teaching.<BR>Included are beautiful examples of what can happen when we incorporate such concepts as Right Thinking, Right Action, Right Mindfulness, amongst others.  I do want to add - so the reader isn't in the slightest bit misled - that in the Buddhist context, the use of \\"Right\\" refers  NOT to a moral definition of right and wrong,  but rather the difference between beneficial, and nonbeneficial trains of thought and action.

The use of prayer and meditation is strongly recommended in the book, which may put off the non-religious person.  However, being as the book is aimed largely at the Pagan population, it may be a moot point. I found the commentary compassionate without being patronizing, a task that is difficult within itself.  &quot;Living and Dying&quot; is certainly a book we've needed for a long time.  So rarely is death treated with such respect and objectivity. Death is a reality, a part of life that we need to embrace, and not fear.  And while I'm nowhere near the state of embracement, I can, with the help of this book, at least reconcile the fact that &quot;inevetable&quot; should not mean &quot;hopeless&quot;.<br />I recommend this book, for many reasons - the dialogue, the topic coverage, the compassion - and I'd include it as &quot;essential reading&quot; for any Pagan.	2001-05-27

After all, this is a look at the life of George Bush, father of good ole' Dubya.  During the election, I'd watched the media virtually strip the whole Bush family of their dignity. I'd listened to both sides of the election debate, and being a UK citizen, couldn't honestly understand what all the fuss was about.  I'd always assumed (though I'm embarassed to admit it)that GB and his son Dubya were victims of white-rich-boy syndrome.  And, I did expect the same from Bush Snr's book.<br />Under the pretense of supporting my husband's Republican interests, I snuggled up on the sofa with a blankie and a hot toddy, and settled in for what I thought would be a tedious read (thus the blankie..). After the first 10 or so pages, however, I began to enjoy the book. I began to see a naive, frightened young man, out on his own for the first time, terrified of both his own naivete and the War.  His sense of morality, family life and loyalty, even then, were obvious. As I read further, one theme kept revolving wonderfully in my head - that of his love for Bar (Barbara Pierce-Bush).  Call me a sucker, but a guy who so clearly adores his beloved can't be all that bad.  A picture was emerging of a man who loved and lived strongly and passionately - not exactly what I was expecting. The more I read, devouring the letters from his fledgling years as a businessman with Zapata, and his political trials and tribulations,  the more I saw the human side of George Bush.  And I liked it.  <br />The letters themselves do range from tear-inducing, heartwarming and funny, to quite honestly, brain-numbingly boring (at this point I'll advise readers to read EVERY letter - it's essential American history..don't think you can skip and miss a couple!) But even through the not-so-stimulating letters, you are always reminded that above everything, George Bush is an American, with a loyalty and passion towards both his family andhis country that is rarely seen.<br />Read this book.  If you're American, it's essential reading.  If you're not, then read it anyway - just to see an amazing collection of letters that illustrates one American boy's life.<br />Bravo, George!	2001-05-04

Prior to reading this book, I didn't really believe in miracles.  Truthfully. Now, however, I find myself a believer. Truthfully.<br />M.R. Sellars has indeed created a miracle in his first novel, &quot;Harm None - A Rowan Gant Investigation&quot;. Writing a first-class thriller without resorting to cliche and folly is in itself a master accomplishment.  But to do so whilst portraying a frequently misunderstood religion successfully (and without pretense), is simply miraculous. On this fine journey, Sellars takes us into the life of Rowan Gant, a practising Witch.  A likeable fellow, Rowan becomes involved, via his close friend Ben Storm, in what appears to be a cult murder.  What ensues is a story of magick, mystery and human nature. The tale spins you around like a whirlwind, picks you up and throws you onto a rollercoaster ride like no other.  The characters are realistic, the technical content is simply incredible, and the ending will indeed surprise and delight you. This book will also scare the pants off you.  It did me...and I'm not easily scared!<br />You must buy this book.  As a supernatural thriller, &quot;Harm None&quot; deserves 5 stars.  As a cross-genre first novel, &quot;Harm None&quot; is a miracle.	2000-12-27
