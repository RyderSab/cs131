As the title indicates and as other reviewers have noted, The Way of Kata concerns deciphering and analyzing forms to maximize your understanding and your ability to apply the movements in competition and in a real fight.<br /><br />But even if you have never practiced kata and have no intentions of doing so, this wonderful book has tons of information on the fighting arts that is interesting, informative and practical.<br /><br />Every page has little goodies, call them gems, which are at once fascinating and educational. Authors Kane and Wilder have many years under their high-ranking black belts and their resultant accumulation of history, powerful anecdotes, and real-life examples of what works and what doesn't makes these gems shine throughout.<br /><br />It goes without saying that kata practitioners will benefit greatly from this book. People who don't practice kata will find it to be an excellent resource and a fine addition to their martial arts library.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Loren Christensen author of WARRIORS and co-author of ON COMBAT.	2005-10-07

His self-deprecating humor is often laugh out loud funny, while having a tinge of Everyman. Every honest man.<br /><br />While Ayres's slant is about his admitted cowardice, he is actually quite brave. A real coward wouldn't have gone to Iraq. A brave person feels fear, admits that he is frightened, and then goes forward to do what needs to be done. That is what Ayres does.<br /><br />The lead character of a book should be a changed person by the end of the story. Chris Ayres definitely changed during his short tour with the Marines. It would have been interesting to see how he would have changed had he stayed for six months.<br /><br />This is a good read: informative, educational, and funny. Perhaps most important, it's honest.<br /><br />His disturbing description of standing before the burning Twin Towers on September 11, watching as people leaped to their death and then seeing the subsequent collapse of the buildings, will remain with me for a long time. For sure, the image of the man sitting on the curb reading to his child during all this will be burned in forever.<br /><br />As the author of WARRIORS and the co-author of ON COMBAT, I highly recommend this great read.	2005-09-30

Pham has penned a marvelous book that should be read by every Vietnam veteran, everyone who lived during those tumultuous times, and every young student wanting to understand the times and the tremendous sacrifice made by so many.<br /><br />Pham's book is a powerful account of one Vietnamese family's experience during the war, the end of the war, and their survival in the years that followed. Pham's mother struggled with establishing a new life in the U.S and his father struggled to stay alive during years of hard labor and `reeductation\\" by the North Vietnamese.<br /><br />Through it all, the author grew to manhood, joined the Marines and served honorably as a pilot. Over the years, a sometimes bitter, sometimes thankful, and often confused young man grew to know the strength of his family and especially the strength of a father who sacrificed so much.<br /><br />Quang Pham signed my book during a reading in Portland, Oregon but I didn't see what he had written until I had left. It says: \\"Thank you for your service in Vietnam.\\"<br /><br />Well, thank you, Quang, for your years of service in the Marines and for your father's tremendous work and courage during the war.<br /><br />Loren W.

In her latest book Strength and Power Training for Martial Arts, she tackles the subject with knowledge gained from years of training experience and practical application in the ring.<br /><br />I've been training since 1965 and over the years I have learned that there are few absolutes in the martial arts. But there is one that's close: fighters who train with resistance - weights, machines and Swiss ball - are almost always superior to those who don't. It just makes sense: resistance exercises, properly done, increases your power, explosiveness, and speed. Not a bad deal for two or three 30-minute sessions a week.<br /><br />Now, there are definitely wrong ways to go about resistance training, but fortunately Sprague shows you how to do it right. She discusses the various muscle groups, explains how they are used in the martial arts, and then shows you the best way to develop them. She also discusses concepts of cardiovascular training, the impact of flexibility on strength, and how to use your mind in training.<br /><br />No matter what your fighting art, this books works.<br /><br />Loren W.

I found Webb's description of the city, its people and their customs to be right on the mark.

First of all there are 480 pages with over 1000 photos! And the Table of Contents takes up six pages with double columns on each page. This puppy is huge but it costs only $29.95. Even if you disagreed with some of the material - not that fighters are strongly opinionated - you're still getting more than your money's worth. It's that loaded and that good.<br /><br />As the title says, the book is about kickboxing, that is, full-contact fighting. Not point fighting where eight times out of 10 the technique wouldn't have had an effect. In kickboxing, the players are really hitting and trying to defeat the other fighter by hurting him so badly that he can't continue, or by knocking him out. So you're not getting foo-foo techniques here; the material in this book is designed to hurt.<br /><br />The authors have been there and done that. Combining their vast experience, they have produced a tremendous book - a huge book -that will keep you reading, learning, and stealing techniques  for a long time.<br /><br />As a guy who has written 18 books on the martial arts and has been punching and kicking for 40 years, I highly recommend Complete Kickboxing.	2004-11-04

Lawrence Kane has written a tremendous text that fills a big void in the martial arts genre. There are many books on how to punch and kick, but as the book title states, this one is about how to teach the martial arts. But it's not just for the teacher; there is plenty of solid information for the student, too.<br /><br />Kane discusses in a highly readable fashion:<br /><br />* Understanding learning style differences<br /><br />* Using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to understand student predilections<br /><br />* Fostering a positive learning environment<br /><br />* Apply the six teaching styles to the martial arts<br /><br />* Lesson planning<br /><br />Just because a martial artist is a black belt or has earned several black belts, doesn't mean that person can teach. That is why this book is so needed. Martial Arts Instruction will help the teacher - new and veteran alike - be the best one he or she can be.<br /><br />I've been training the martial arts for 40 years and have written 18 books on the fighting arts. I found Martial Arts Instruction fresh, insightful, and highly informative. Most importantly, Kane's teaching ideas work.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-11-01

After the murder, the skinhead population and their crimes escalated as in no other city, so I was sent to the Gang Enforcement Team where I could monitor skins and investigate their crimes. I spent four years focusing on them, including working as a bodyguard for Tom Metzger during the two-week civil trial, which is covered so well in A Hundred Little Hitlers.<br />Though I was \\"the skinhead expert\\" and Public Information Officer for everything that was skinhead related, Langer's painstaking research and powerful, compelling writing kept me turning the pages, mumbling at least a hundred times, \\"I didn't know that.\\"<br />This book is more than just a gripping tale of murder. Langer includes the history of the white supremacy movement; history of the various players; the politics in the movement, in the justice system and in the city; police procedure; and courtroom drama, all told from the standpoint of scholarly research, and profound analysis and conclusions. She shows great bravery as she paints a picture that isn't always politically correct in the delicate world of race relations. But she does so with truth, which wasn't always the case during this period (and still isn't today).<br />During the late 1980s and early 1990s, black gangs were shooting up neighborhoods virtually every night, Southeast Asian gangs were terrorizing their own community with high-tech, automatic weapons, and Hispanic gangs were killing each other and spraying innocent neighborhoods with bullets. Some of this made the news, but much of it didn't. But should a skinhead draw a swastika on a wall, it led at 5 o'clock.<br />I tried for two years to get a reporter to do a story that showed how black gangs often perpetrated more racially motivated crimes than skinheads. Finally, one reporter had the guts. The camera showed me holding 24 police reports of black on white crimes, but only six reports depicting skinhead crimes against minorities in the same four-week period. The next day, the reporter got in trouble at his TV station, and I was ordered by the chief's office to never, ever, do that again. The truth was not politically correct.<br />Langer doesn't mention this specifically, but she does discuss how the relationships between whites and blacks in Portland \\"required immediate vengeance for the death.\\" She discusses how the police produced a politically acceptable case to the DA, rather than digging deeper into the facts of what really occurred the night of the murder. She talks about how the Justice Department had elicited the \\"racial motivation\\" plea bargain, which was the platform for all that followed. And she asks what would have happened if Tom Metzger had not been the \\"white supremacist of the hour,\\" if Morris Dees had not had his \\"agency\\" theory all ready for his next target, and if the three skinheads had gone to trial and all the facts, the truth, had been brought out.<br />This is an incredible, courageous writing achievement, a definitive work about a murder, about hate, about our justice system, and about morals.<br />From a guy who was there, I highly recommend A Hundred Little Hitlers.each other and spraying innocent neighborhoods with bullets.

She did it in Fighting Science and she does it again in The Science of Takedowns, Throws and Grappling for Self-Defense. You won't find 40 pages of warm-ups and 50 pages of basic punches and kicks. Instead, she jumps right into the meat of the subject and doesn't let up until the last page.<br />Sprague is one of the top analytical martial arts writers publishing today. Just when you think you are familiar with a concept or technique she is discussing and demonstrating, she adds a new piece of information, sometimes big, sometimes small, but always in such a way that makes you go, \\"Oh, okay. I see why that technique works.\\" Or, \\"I see now why mine doesn't work.\\"<br />With such subheadings as \\"The inherent weakness of your stance;\\" \\"Positioning preparatory to the takedown;\\" \\"Combining linear and circular motion;\\" \\"Shoot and gap closure for lower leg takedown;\\" \\"Ground mobility exercise;\\" \\"Takedown using two points of balance;\\" \\"Stick grabbing exercise;\\" \\"Center of gravity and momentum in throws:\\" and dozens more, you not only get your money's worth many times over, but you gain knowledge about the many aspects of the grappling arts that will overlap to all new techniques you learn in the future.<br />This is a book you will reference in the years to come.

Lee's speed was absolutely incredible. His backfist was nearly imperceptible and his footwork for closing the gap was a blur.<br /><br />What a loss to the martial arts world that he left us so soon.

First Avenue is Clausen's first book, and the former Seattle police officer places much of the story on First Avenue and around Pike's Market.<br />The storyline accurately emphasizes the low-key relationships that a beat cop will establish with the everyday citizens, both the good and the bad, who inhabit his territory.<br />Clausen is a good writer and the story has the rich detail that only a real cop could put into a crime story. On the other hand, the story is just too low key. For sure, most police yarns have action that is far over the top, but in First Avenue, Clausen has gone the other way. In the end, the book is a well-written, ultra slow paced yawner.	2001-07-05

Author Sandra Kitt had a good police advisor (I am a retired police officer) as all of the police action and procedure is accurate.<br />Kitt is a black woman. She says that she enjoys putting white and black people together in intimate relationships in all her books to see what happens. That is what made this book much more than an average police yarn.<br />Good, easy read.	2001-06-09

As a veteran of fighting in the real world, Alain Bureese does not glorify street fighting, bar brawling, fighting over women, or fighting for no other reason than a need to kick somebody's butt.<br />He titles his first chapter, &quot;A Little about the Game&quot; but then points out in the first sentence that fighting is not a game. He says it this way. \\"Serious consequences happen when people fight. People get hurt and people get killed. Many wind up behind bars, and unlike in Jailhouse Rock, it's not fun spending time in prison on a manslaughter charge for killing a guy in a fight.\\"<br />Hard-Won Wisdom contains a slew of self-defense techniques, concepts and principles that the author has found applicable from his many years traveling around the world and frequenting some very rough places.<br />However, the book is also about the nature of fighting and ways you can avoid it. He says: \\"There are people who become addicted to and like violent encounters. How you handle these feelings determines what kind of person you are. The first step to overcoming the problem is recognizing the feeling. The next step is to realize and determine what brings it out. This takes a lot of introspection, but it can be worth the trouble. You learn this about yourself and control it - or it will control you. Remember, it gets expensive paying for things you break and people you hurt.\\"<br />Hard-Won Wisdom from the School of Hard Knocks is applicable to the needs of police officers and martial artists, not only for the techniques that it teaches but for what it teaches about the nature of fighting toe-to-toe. The book will not only help you understand some of the dangerous people you encounter every day, but it will also help you understand yourself.<br />As an author of 13 books on the martial arts, I highly recommend this one.	2001-05-16
US	51732923	R2IJS962MAHBQ5	0967880912	558641304	Crime Scenes	Books	4	4	4	N	N	very good	There are a lot of anecdotal police books being published these days, many of them self-published. The primary reasons officers are paying to see their books in print is that publishing houses are rejecting them because many are poorly written, and even the good ones are not selling well.  There are exceptions. Chicago police officer Gina Gallo has authored a well-written anecdotal police book titled Crime Scenes, published by Blue Murder Press.<br />Gallo pulls no punches as she colors the gritty world of Chicago's mean streets, the gangs, guns, hookers and the dope. She tells the story of cops trying to make a difference and trying to stay alive in a world turned upside down by street violence and stupid bureaucrats.<br />She begins with a story that reveals a little about police humor, that thing that keeps cops sane. Gallo handles humor wonderfully in this opening story and in others that follow as she shows just how goofy people can be. But just when she gets you laughing, sometimes out loud, her next story will tug at your heartstrings.<br />The book is not just about cops, but about victims, too. Some of those are funny, but many are heartbreaking, revealing a compassionate side of police work never reported by the media or seen by those who look only for the negative in police officers.<br />Each story takes five to ten minutes to read, which is perfect in this fast-paced world. Be careful, though: The stories are sort of like potato chips. You can't stop after just one.	2001-03-24

They are the ones who must face the dragon so that others can go about their lives with some sense of peace.<br />In this wonderful book, the author has allowed the cops to tell it like it is. If you are offended, outraged and disgusted by what you read, it might be because the reality that cop's work in is far removed from your safe world.<br />Cops face humanity beneath the veneer of societal graces, a place that is often horrific.

What's amazing is that some of these dummies have survived in this world as long as they have.<br />While you will laugh out loud at the stories in this book, know that there are thousands of other dumb acts by criminals that could have been included and thousands more that have occurred since this book was written.<br />And while you laugh, keep the sobering thought in mind that many of these dumb crooks are dangerous.	2000-12-31
US	51732923	R24X0LN5M6SLAT	1930782136	958283385	Quarter Moon Rising	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Intense with realistic characters	Kent Perry recently retired after serving 28 years with the Portland Police Bureau. As a detective, he investigated more than 100 homicides, and he has brought that gritty world to his first novel, a character-driven, police-procedural story that only a real cop could have written.<br /> Kent has a wonderful sense of story, a knack for instant characterization and the ability to maintain tension from the first page to the last. Just try to put the book down during the last 40 or 50 pages.<br /> Quarter Moon Rising is the story of a residential robbery that turns into a can of worms. Two people end up dead and millions of dollars in paintings are stolen, including one called Quarter Moon Rising.<br />  The lead detective, John DeSoto, must conduct his investigation while battling personal demons, an authoritarian captain and pressure from the media. Along the way, we meet a host of characters: cops, thieves, swindlers, tramps, brutal killers, and many others. Although some characters we see only briefly, with just a couple of sharply-written sentences, Kent fleshes them in so well that they instantly come alive.<br /> Kent's writing really shines when he is describing violence: tight, raw and in your face, no doubt the result of personally seeing dozens upon dozens of victims and investigating the events that led to their last days on Earth.<br /> He also does a wonderful job with dialogue, which can be a problem for new writers. His characters speak realistically and in character, all without drawing attention to the writing.<br /> The paperback...runs 388 pages and at 5 ½ by 8 1/2, it's larger than the average paperback.<br /> I highly recommend Quarter Moon Rising. Not because it's written by a fellow police officer, but because it's a darn good book.	2000-12-07
US	51732923	R1W48GLIBP0WES	0671034855	552051704	Portraits of Guilt	Books	5	11	14	N	N	A powerful book	I had just a passing acquaintance with Jeanne Boylan when she worked in the Detectives Division of the Portland Police Bureau in Oregon in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After leaving  Portland, she took her incredible crime-fighting skills all over the country to help solve some of the biggest cases in the last several years.<br /> It's nearly impossible not to follow her career since she is in the news frequently and has been a regular on at least one TV program. Her crime fighting weapon? A pencil.<br />  Jeanne Boylan is more than a sketch artist; virtually every large PD has one of those. She brings to the craft a talent that is so rare, so seeming mystical, that she's been called on to assist in virtually every high-profile manhunt in the last couple of decades, such as the Unabomber, Polly Klaas kidnaping, Susan Smith child drownings, Oklahoma City bombing, and the murder of Ennis Cosby, son of the actor, Bill Cosby.<br />  Boylan also brings to the task of &quot;facial identification art&quot; a unique understanding of mental trauma and an ability to probe deeply into victims' subconscious minds. Alone in a room, she talks to crime victims for hours, discussing their hobbies and interests, while interspersing questions that pry out true memories of the perpetrator's face. The end result is a sketch, a portrait, really, that looks eerily like the suspect's face.<br />  In her new, best-selling book, Portraits of Guilt: The Woman Who Profiles the Faces of America's Deadliest Criminals, Boylan explains how she works to reach under the layers of pain, beyond the contamination done by well-meaning police officers who, in their haste to find the perpetrator, bombard the victims' memory with photographs of possible suspects. She probes deeply into the victims' psyche to find the pure image of the face that was seared into the brain, sometimes for only a few seconds, at the moment of trauma.<br /> Boylan narrates her own story--how she got started and why she feels the need to accept every case the FBI gives her. Although she doesn't reveal in great detail how she is able to almost psychically formulate a portrait, she does make it clear how law enforcement's antiquated way usually buries the evidence, making her tough job even tougher.<br /> As the book progresses chronologically through her cases, Boylan reveals the slow disintegration of her marriage, while simultaneously her career takes off to a level of near celebrity status.<br /> Boylan discusses why she is compelled to continue to help police agencies and crime victims, though at times the work takes its toll on her personally. She also talks about her workshops where she teaches law enforcement about human memory, why it should be considered evidence and how it should be protected. She feels good that she is influencing the way in which police departments interview crime victims, though their acceptance is a slow process.<br /> This is a fascinating book with lots of fresh insights into many of the most infamous cases in recent history. For example, the evidence she uncovered in the Oklahoma City bombing will leave you curious as to whether all the suspects are in custody.<br /> I strongly recommend this book.he feels the need to accept every case the FBI gives her.

He wasn't competing but was there as a celebrity guest. <br />I stood with others at the back of the tournament hall and listened in awe as he talked about having just finished filming Marlow and his plans to leave soon for Hong Kong to begin filming a movie. <br />Later, I watched him warm-up a great tournament fighter named Luis Delgado. Lee's speed was absolutely incredible. His backfist was nearly imperceptible and his footwork for closing the gap was a blur. <br />What a loss to the martial arts world that he left us so soon. But we still have this book of his notes. It a wonderful bible, if you will, that will make any martial artist look at his own training to see how some of Lee's ideas can fit. <br />There will always be the Jackie Chans and Jet Lis who will come along and dazzle us with their screen antics. But Bruce Lee was a seeker of knowledge, a true master of the fighting arts and philosophy. Some of it is in this wonderful book.  <br />As an author of 13 books on the martial arts, I highly recommend this book for every MA library.	2000-11-10

Don't you wish you could warm up first before you tackle the big OCD?<br /> Well, check this out. There is a quick and easy way to warm up before you get to work that will make you feel loose and energized your entire shift. There is also a routine that you can use that will increase your flexibility faster than you can imagine.<br /> Here is why flexibility is good for hard-working crime fighters.<br /> * Stretching feels good after a long shift in a car or behind a desk  * Flexibility increases your range of motion  * Flexibility reduces the chance of your getting hurt  * Flexibility is good for your joints  * Flexibility may increase your strength  * Flexibility increases your speed<br /> Can't see yourself doing ballerina stretches and you're a little afraid you just might like wearing a tutu? Well, don't worry about it because here are a book and video that present a revolutionary Russian system of stretching that's easy to do and get results fast.<br /> I wrote in my review of Pavel Tsatsouline's book Power to the People! : Russian Strength Training Secrets for Every American that Pavel's methods get results while violating many of the &quot;truths&quot; that have been held as sacred for so long in the world of strength development.<br /> In Beyond Stretching: Russian Flexibility Breakthroughs, he again offers result-producing methods, this time for increasing flexibility, while again violating what has been held as truths ever since you were in grade school gym class.<br /> Beyond Stretching is divided into three main chapters. In Chapter one, &quot;Nerd Stuff,&quot; he lays the foundation of his unique system. In Chapter Two, &quot;Do It My Way,&quot; he gets into the physiology of his system as to why and how it works, and in Chapter Three, &quot;Mobility Drills and  Dynamic Stretches,&quot; he demonstrates the actual exercises. These are not the usual flexibility exercises done the usual way.<br /> Pavel's writing style is no nonsense, efficient and quite often funny. If you are looking to be coddled, you won't get it from him. He tells you when something is tough and then he tells you to do it any way. The beauty of it is when you do what he says, you will begin seeing progress in a couple of weeks.  Here are some of the things you will learn in this Beyond Stretching.<br /> * How to develop optimal flexibility in weeks instead of years  * How to do splits and high kicks even if you are over 40 or 50  * How to avoid injuries  * How to not feel like the Tin Man in the morning  * Learn how much flexibility you really need  * Learn how to display maximum flexibility without a warm-up  * Learn how to stretch in the morning to be loose all day<br />Personal Note: I have been training in the martial arts for nearly 36 years and, as such, stretching exercises have been part of my regular routine. As a result, I'm more flexible than the average guy. After reading this book and viewing the video, I tried four of Pavel's exercises.  Three weeks later, my flexibility had improved by about 20 percent. At this rate, I figure I'll be able to scratch my head with my big toe in a couple more months.<br />Loren W.

Nonetheless, there are still some good things in it that can motivate the reader to seek out more on the subject.<br />For example, there is Norris's red-line drill, which is still an excellent training method to push the karateka beyond what he thought was his top speed. He also touches briefly on mental imagery, which is arguably one of the top training methods used today by top athletes in virtually every sport. Lastly, Norris illustrates, with plenty of pictures, his concept of blitzing, that is, charging straight in and launching a hand or foot technique every half step or so.<br />This is still a good book worthy to be in every fighter's library.<br />Loren W.

You'll learn how to deal with such vital aspects of undercover  operations as handling wary, greedy or double-crossing informants; covering  the inevitable mistakes you'll make while undercover; and choosing the  appropriate weapons to carry in case things go wrong.  The book is  written in a clear and entertaining voice, far from the dreary, dry read  found in  too many police technique books. VanCook takes you through the  details of undercover work while making you feel as if you are being let  into a private world only a few experience.  Here are some of the  chapters contained within.  * A special message to women undercover  officers  * Creating an undercover identity  * Creating an alternate  personality  * Personal transportation  * Undercover Overnight  * Getting  into character  * Rehearsing your new identity  * Advance training  *  Working narcotics and other illegal drugs  * Robbery, burglary and theft  *  Homicide  * Electronic aids  * Creating illusions  * Undercover weapons  *  Developing memory  * Testifying in court  * And lots more<br /> One of  the features I like about Going Undercover is that not only does VanCook  explain in detail how to do a particular phase of undercover work, but he  also shows how things can go wrong, which they usually do, and what you can  do about it.  For example, in a chapter called &quot;Creating  Illusions,&quot; the author explains how you can convince a burglary  suspect, who you are trying to get next to, that you are an armed robber.  He even shows how you can take the burglar along on a &quot;robbery.&quot;  VanCook then illustrates what can go wrong even with the best of plans.  The author's writing is conversational and filled with humor and crammed  with excellent information. I recommend this book.I recommend this book.	2000-04-13

I bought this book for two reasons: I enjoy all of  Loren Christensen's books and also because I am not naturally fast. The drills and exercises in this book made me a much faster martial artist.  I especially liked his  discussion on how to create an illusion of speed and make your opponent  think you are much faster than you really are.

It's mostly about racist skins but there is plenty about antiracists, too. It's not a historical read on the subject, but rather a  book that provides an in-depth insight to how skins think, act and what  they want. I recommend it to students writing a paper, police officers and  community folks.  Those who haven't liked the book are those skins of a  particular set who feel they have been slighted.	1999-07-20

I laughed, was moved and disgusted all in the same story. It's an incredible revelation of the human condition.  The anecdotes, which range from one to four pages  long, chronicle events from the 70's and 80's, as well as a few recent  incidents, in an area one officer in the book called, &quot;A place  forgotten by God.&quot;<br />Policing was indeed different back then, and if  you've been around long enough, this curb side look at skid row will have  you laughing and saying to yourself, &quot;Oh yea, I remember that.&quot;  Like any good story teller, Christensen has woven some tales together and  modified some he could not other wise have told.<br />While Loren lived most  of these stories, other officers contributed a few. Some of the anecdotes  are so disgusting that you will have to put the book down, though a short  time later you will want to pick it up and resume where you left off. There  are four chapters: Characters, Sex, Violence and Bodily Excretions, and  Loren says there are several stories that could have fit into all of them.  He says that Skid Row Beat is not for the easily offended, the overly  politically correct, or those who view community policing as a religious  experience. The tales run the gamut from absolutely hilarious, to  stomach-turning gross, to poignant. One story will offend, another will  move you, and another you will retell to your friends.  Skid Row Beat is  a quick read and I suspect more than one copy will find its way into the  &quot;library&quot; next to the porcelain throne where one can read a story  or two, put the book down and pick it up the next time you are making a  visit.<br />This book reflects a time before &quot;politically correct&quot;  was even a thought, much less a phrase.  Times were different, and after  reading the book you can only reflect that we have come a long way since  the days when it was still a crime to be drunk in public, and the beat cop  was expected to &quot;take care of business&quot; on his district. Many of  the skid row beat cops were street monsters who were tough as nails on the  outside, but with hearts bigger than all of outdoors.he beat cop  was expected to &quot;take care of business&quot; on his district.
