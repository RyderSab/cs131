Well, Stephen is an old friend of mine from times in Kosovo.  The ideas in this book represent years of research and thinking.  They also represent long hours of listening to his probing of Islam while we drank coffee in the Grand Hotel Pristina.  His mind is so detailed and he talks so fast, it is difficult to follow.  I have used his book on Kosovo in my honors courses and students found it very \\"enlightening.\\"  The Two Faces of Islam is intense, complex, detailed, thought-provoking.  One should never underestimate the thoroughness and penetration of the author's thinking and knowledge.  I have trouble with some of his ideas, but no one raises serious questions better than he does, which is his intent and his talent.	2002-12-02

The famous players with the\\"invisible maestro\\" of the entire prosecution?  None other than Rudy Giuliani - now the hero of 9/11 but then the 39 year-od US Attorney who led the entire prosecution.  And the Mafia, the FBi undercover agents, capos, and so it goes - with implications for the White House and the power heavies.  As fresh a subject in 1988 as it is now.

In its richness, attention to detail, vivid scenes, a depth of understanding and imagination, and a dedication to historical accuracy, it reminds me of another such work, \\"Galileo's Daughter.\\" Small wonder that \\"Year of Wonder\\" has been selected as both a \\"NY Times\\" and \\"Washington Post\\" Notable Book.  It is the best single fictional work on the Black Plague - a phenomenon that depopulated Europe up to 50% in some areas such as Florence, Italy and surely 35-45% in other areas of Europe, wiping out at least 1/3 of Europe's population.  This dreadful recurring nastiness, with a horror 20th century folks cannot imagine, ushered in a European mentality that shaped and molded the civilization of a Continent.  And created the conditions for growth, increased wages, and labor demand.<br /><br />What Brooks does is reduce this century of astonishing death to one small isolated village in England.  We live through the intimate details of the horrendous deaths and the living of those who survived in a way no one has yet captured so strongly.  I would recommend that one read this jewel of a novel in conjunction with the work by Norman Cantor, \\"In the Wake of the Plague - The Black Death and the World it Made.\\"  And perhaps, most important, to journey through the plague with \\"A Journal of the Plague Year\\" by \\"eyewitness\\" Daniel Defoe - enlarging upon his own childhood memories.  Possibly the most important record of the Plague written, Defoe gives us the observer's incredible account, while Brooks shares a solid researcher's remarkable imagination and literary excellence. And captures the internal struggle occurring within so many thinking folks of the time about God as causation and Nature as causation.  If God brought the plague upon the \\"house,\\" the solution is in prayer and lamentation.  But if the Plague came out of nature, then the observing eye and a slight emergence of the \\"scientific method\\" might discern causation that has remedies based in reality.n reality.	2002-08-13

I read 3-4 mysteries a week in between my non-fiction work. And it is difficult to avoid boredom, necessity to keep \\"research notes\\" while reading, characters fixed in clay, complexity that swirls in unintellible circles, clumsy writing, vapid portrayals, unrelenting darkness for the sake of darkness, and to remember a week later that I even read the book.<br />So what do I and avid mystery fans look for, even require? Complex, intricate plots that one can follow without a check list. Characters that catch one's imagination. Straightforward writing that captures the time and the place and the people. Riveting suspense that goes somewhere. Perhaps a touch a humor and a handful of humanness. And careful attention to detail and reality. Sheldon gives us all of this - and in ONE BOOK!<br />This mystery, the 3rd in a series, is as fresh and involved as the first two. The author loves his writing, lives his characters, walks his scenes. And his characters grow, book by book. And so does the author. The California Bay Area has been overdone in books and movies. But Siegel brings it alive with a freshness and joie de vivre that places one there, walking the walk, learning the cultures, listening to the sounds, smelling the smells. He takes his reader INSIDE the city to experience it, not just watch.<br />And his \\"plots.\\" I wonder if any current mystery author develops a more intriguing, yet concise, panorama of carefully interlaced plots than Siegel. They require, demand attention, but not labor. And the great bonus - his characters. He does not just \\"develop\\" them, he enlivens them. And we begin to know them, root for them, understand them, hope for them. How many times do we have the opportunity to walk away from a novel and really care about the folks in them, and hope for continuing change and growth in the next book? Not often. But here we have come to know the whole bloody family and the friends and their challenges and joys and sorrows. This writer really has it all and he shares it so \\"nicely\\" with his readers. Surely this mystery will hit the best seller list again and raise enormous anticipations for Book #4. \\"Thanks for the memories,\\" Sheldon Siegel!s and sorrows.

I have read all, and I mean all the legal mysteries in the  past 5 years.  Take the top ten authors and compare this writer, this book.  True, several of the top ten have had difficulty sustaining the excitement  and intricacy evident in their 1st or 2nd books.  A few of those ten have  become, yes, BORING.  Some have substituted fast paced legal labor with  just plain labor and the reader suffers.  Siegal is fresh and brillliant.  The tightness, intricacy, rigorous attention to both plot formation and  dialogue, superb descriptions, supersonic pace, Hitchcockian ending equal  one of the best in the past 5 years.<br /> One of the few writers who does  NOT allow intricacy to slow the pace, to require the reader to &quot;keep  notes,&quot; to read laboriously.  Beautifully researched, carefully edited  (FOR A CHANGE), crafted with an appealing development of characters (THEY  DO NOT JUST SIT THERE LIKE SO MANY LATELY) compel a constant reader like  myself to sit up, perk up, stand up and get a cup of coffee for a long  night ahead.

Instead of trudging through it, word for word, the well known habit of reading the book jacket, glancing through the chapters, perusing the introduction and conclusion, and reminding themselves of the author's past laurels has incapacitated the reviewers from penetrating the reality of Plum Island. &quot;His skills still work at top levels, his sentences show grain like fine wood work, his dialogue has much human layering, and each page carries a deep gloss.

The idea of biological and nuclear accidents is compelling, as is the interconnection with archaeological digs, a range of potential murderers, and a few diabolical CIA types.

Ponder for a moment the book jacket's blurb from the Philadelphia Inquirer (which raises serious questions about that person's lack of talent.One suspects DeMille got caught up with his words, decided the book would not sell if it did not &quot;last&quot; for 500 pages, and went on vacation before submitting a decent finished draft.	1997-10-19

Such a tight, intriguing, carefully drawn plot.  The characters are fresh and intelligent.  The roller coaster action hangs together without distraction - so difficult to do.  And Carlotta Carlyle, woman detective par excellence, has not become brown and jagged with age. Boston makes for an interesting setting.	1997-10-18

Appears both he and the publisher of this new paperback rested on his past laurels - with the former whipping out a messy and ill-drawn plot in a weekend and the latter failing to even read it before sending it to the printer.	1997-10-18
