He writes of the day to day life of sailors from the 19th century that is very knowledgable and page turning.  I finally got to see what it would have been like.  He created characters that I felt interested in and wanted to learn more about.  If you've ever wondered what it was like on a sailing ship- Lundy will anwser all your questions, and entertain.

Incredibly real characters, action, history filled pages!  I loved every page!  Mr. Davey created a group of characters that I honestly haven't seen in too long.  His book is filled with likable people (and of course some that aren't likable) that made the world take flight while I read it!  Does that make sense?  I mean to say that reading his book made the world around seem better-ya know?  Great, happy, AND well developed characters.  I got what I always want out of this book.  I got a week of pure pleasure being lost in it's pages!  That's all I ask of fiction- take me away to a better place!  Let me see things and experience things I 've never felt before.  Davey does this perfectly with this, and his second book.  If you're not interested in aviation, don't worry.  This is still a great story worth reading.  If you do love the history of aviation like I, then be prepared for some great facts and insight.  Bravo Davey!  Keep the books coming!	2003-01-01

This book is full of &quot;Cusslerettes&quot; - those short, facinating narratives into the world of history.  Forget the failed searches and insight into his life (though they too are written wonderfully and a pleasure to read) and enjoy the incredible tales of men and machines set in situations that dumbfound.

Let the mind unload away from a tv.  Too many of these reviewers seem to forget that.  This book, and all in the series are excellent escapes to a world of action and wonder.  Think of escaping to different areas around the globe, and always coming out the hero!  That's what you get from Cussler's books.  He peels away the blandness of life and gives you a kick in the rear!  I'd hate to see people miss out on his works because of some of these reviews.  Entertaining fiction rarely gets better.	2002-12-31

His books show history as being populated by regular, yet interesting characters. He takes the time to reveal to his readers the unique personalities making up the story, much like an old hand filling in the new guy at work. For this reason, I feel that anything written by him could be immensely interesting. Now imagine him writing about something that is quite interesting: WWII. As usual he has produced a work that cost me plenty of sleep from staying up until the early morning hours, unable to put it down.<br />For the story itself, it is incredible. What those men went through is amazing. I found it very enjoyable to read about a group of guys made into supermen by the author. The brotherhood formed amongst them made me wish that I could have have experienced it. Perhaps this is what held my interest the most. Now if only he'd turn his talent loose on WWI...	2000-12-28

As someone who loves to read about history, this book encompassed all that I appreciate so much in an historical account: straight, to the point, no nonsense telling of the facts and emotions rellenvant to a time in history as seen through the eyes of an ordinary person. Rooney does an excellent job showing to the reader that there was nothing special about him or how the events unfolded for him. He was just any young man dragged into war and left to experience the events as they happened. That he was able to begin a long and enjoyable career in journalism thanks to the war is quite typical of how life seems to unfold (how many of us look at where we are in life and realize that just a slight curve in the road got us here?). Beyond that, it was a pleasure to read an account of WWII by a person who's honesty and intelligent wit are so looked foward to on sunday nights.	2000-12-10

As a history buff, I find myself pulled towards the romantic side of war. Although my views are quite regularly blown away with each new wartime history that I read, few others did it so completely (&quot;Iron Coffins&quot; by Herbert A. Werner is definitely on par with this book). &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; dissects a normal soldier (enemy soldier, depending on where you are on the globe) into a perfectly normal, emotional young man. You not only are able to see the terrible waste of life that epitomizes WWI as a whole, you also see one soldier's attempt at wading through the hell of war. It's amazing to think that a generation survived it, and that the world still goes on.	2000-10-17

This book opened something in me that I wish more would: the desire to write. While reading Vonnegut's varied works, I felt myself itching to grab the wp and start writing--anything! Perhaps his imaginative stories or the fact that each one was so different from the other brought this on. Whatever the reason, the book exposed a deep mental level that few others even scratch.

The one thing that I enjoy most from Ambrose's works is the fact that he brings a human side to his books. You don't just read about facts from history, instead you read of people that populated the time and how they dealt with issues at hand. This book is no exception. Ambrose filled it with insights into the unique characters who were the only ones capable of executing such a feat. This is definitely an enjoyable book that gives deep and interesting insight into a fascinating subject.	2000-10-16

The book was somewhat interesting, in a crash scene sort of way--you find that you can't stop reading on, even though you know you shouldn't.

All in all, the story consisted of two dimensional characters, a loosely researched plot, and outdated science. Save your money!	2000-10-15

Although this book was very enjoyable to read, it lacked the character depth and highly tuned plot so looked foward to in the other books of the series-- I felt that I was reading a quickly thrown together storyline with  only marginal thought given to the usually complex characters.

I've read many nonfiction books on submarine exploits during WWII and can say without a doubt that this book of fiction has all the gripping suspense and realism of those others, plus a very compelling list of characters and  a story that carries you through until the very end.

The concept of showing everyday life on a seasonal basis could have been a complete joy to read, but unfortunately  the authors seemed to think they were writing a Calculus book or other such  thing of unenjoyment. As in the latter case, interesting facts get stale  fast if not presented with some sort of readablility. Give me a work by  Keegan or Ambrose anyday over this.	2000-05-13

Although the plot was interesting (even though it was merely a Jurasic Park), the writing, character development, etc. was lacking considerably. Why, oh why, couldn't Crichton have populated the story with three  dimensional characters that one could enjoy following? All of the  characters could easily have been replaced by Good Guy 1, Good Guy 2, Bad  Guy 1, and Bad Guy 2, and NO harm would have come to the story--that's how  underdeveloped they were! As for the writing, there are ways to begin  dialogue other than to type He said, &quot;...&quot;    And what about  atmosphere, tangible descriptions, etc? In short, the book had a good  concept but unfortunatey seemed to have been written merely as the  forethought to a script.	2000-03-22

What struck me about this book were the revelations of what was really going on during the Cold War. The USSR toppled when I was in High School and to see the friction that existed when I was a child is remarkable. If you think back to the 70s and 80s, the real struggle that existed can be  lost.

I never found myself wishing that it would end, in fact I'm unhappy now that it has. Clancy proves with this book that he is one of the best story tellers  of our time. He used his usual form of many seemingly unconnected twists  that in the end all came together and made perfect sense. That is why all  900 pages were fun to read. As for the plot, it was the BEST I've read this  year.	2000-02-08

Udet wrote his account with a straightforward yet highly descriptive style. Don't expect any dry verse or dull monotone. He captured all the emotions and thoughts that he must have experienced in a way that some novelist would be hard pressed to mimmick. It is interesting to read of his  many achievement in war (second highest scoring German Ace) and then to  read of his near failures after the war. In short, this book gives the  story of a remarkable life that reads in such a way that it is truely hard  to put down. You owe it to yourself to search for this book.

Death's Men gives a highly readable account of the British soldiers of WWI. The author used well placed first hand accounts along with his own well thought out views to give a very complete picture of the men who  fought the war.

Let's start by saying that the plot and action are top notch Cussler. But...the author seems to have taken it for granted that most readers aren't first time readers to his books. As such he left out considerable  character development. All the action in the world gets stale fast if the  entire cast of characters are two demensional. By merely providing simple  observations into who the characters really are makes all the difference.  You see this at the end when the writing becomes much more enjoyable to  follow (love involvment, change of relationships, etc.)	2000-01-20

WWI premier ace, Manfred von Richthofen gives an honest and respectable account of his amazing career. His straightfoward, blunt style of writing allowed the pages to flow quickly. The popular image of the Red Baron as a  cold-blooded, &quot;machine-made&quot; German is quite inaccurate. Instead  you see a portrait of a man who pokes fun at the human mistakes made early  in his career as well as some humorous accounts that he graciously gives to  the reader. Note: There is a preface by C.G. Grey that I believe is best  read as a postscript. Most of what is written by Grey is correct as seen  through the eyes of the British but it is overly clouded with war time  propaganda that may cause the reader to approach Richthofen's account with  a biased, defensive manner. One should approach this work with a neutral  mind and allow the pieces to fall where they may. Franks, in his  introduction clears the air considerably, but still the damage may be done.	2000-01-17

This book has it all: well researched facts, highly readable style of writing, and thought provoking comments on the immense waste of life known as Verdun. The reader is able to see first hand the enormous waste of lives  caused by the often aloof and childish actions of those few in charge.
