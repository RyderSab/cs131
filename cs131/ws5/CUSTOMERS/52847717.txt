US	52847717	R1Y13MTWD0PZAM	0007107234	405854401	Little Book of Karma	Books	5	8	10	N	Y	The best book I have read about Karma.	I have read several books about Karma, and this volume is the most concise, and clearly written karma volume that I have ever had the pleasure to read.<br />My ONE complaint with this volume is that the author tells you it is possible to change your future; but does not tell you how to change the future. You change the future by changing how you think and react mentaly (consciously and subconsciously) and in the way you speak (affecting the world around you).<br />I want to quote a few portions of the book; followed by my comments.<br />Page 10: &quot;Astrologers with notable exceptions, all too often reinforce the idea that we hava an unalterable destiny, It is mapped out at the momebt of birth in the alignment of planetsin different constelations and there is nothing we can do about it.&quot; _|You CAN change your future; because I have done it many times ago. I was supposed to die from a terminal disease 23 years ago.<br />Page 12: &quot;No matter how accurate a reading, the wrong interpretation can do more harm than good.&quot; _| This certainly is true.<br />This book has 100 quotes; that you are supposed to open at random and read than study on the quote. I have quoted some of them below for your convenience.<br />-----<BR>     Environment<br />Environment is not the ultimate factor in determining our destiny. Too many people have defied their environment, upbringing and cultural background and achieved greatness for us to believe otherwise.<BR>-----<BR>     Regret<br />Instead of regretting the past, create the future<BR>-----<BR>     Transmuting Negativity<br />If you have a pattern of negative thinking, introduce a new positive thought to transmute it. If you expect failure, visualize success; If you expect illness, visualize health; and so on.<br />     This method with the direction of universal lifeforce energy<BR>     is how I cured myself of the terminal disease.<BR>-----<BR>     Higher Beings<br />Masters, angels, avatars, and gods never force us to believe in them. But evert step we take towards them, they take two towards us.<BR>-----<br />Aloha nui loa. Two Bears	2004-05-13

It was the Kabbalists of the 14th century (if memory serves) that invented the Tarot.<br />Here is the major points of my argument.<br />1. the four suits (Cups, Pentacles, Swords and Wands) represents the four elements.<br />2. The suits are numbered from 1 (ace) to ten. There are 10 sephiroth (spheres of consciousness) on the Tree of life.<br />3. There are 22 major arcana. There are 22 letters in the Jewish alphabet, and there are 22 paths interconnecting the 10 sephiroth on the tree of life.<br />4. There are four face cards of each suit. The Kabbalah teaches the universe began with 10 dimensions, then the upper 6 dimensions collapsed and leaving a universe of 4 dimensions (Height, Width, depth, and time).<br />Thank you for your time and attention.

US	52847717	R1TBHSIWDSAMY	0966014227	665935544	Mana Cards	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	Fairly accurate tool for Hawai'ian spirituality	Aloha nui loa.<br />If you buy this item; please be aware that you will only receive the deck of cards with no book. <br />This is no problem  because there are four cards that list brief meanings of the 44 cards in three or four lines of text that cover both sides of these cards. If you need better descriptions of the cards, and other data; I would recommend that you buy the set with a deck of cards and a book.<br />These cards with explainations of the 44 cards does not specify how to do any reading other than pulling one card at random. I hope there is more information about other card spreads in the book; because one single card may not provide enough data to be worthwhile.<br />Now about the cards themself.<br />The cards are flimsy and bend too easily. <br />The artwork is absolutely beautiful. <br />It would be very beneficial if the cards were plastic coated so the cards would be more durable.<br />I am not entirely happy with the deck.<br />1. The cards are large, and women with smaller hands may have a difficult time trying to shuffle the cards.<br />2. There are five cards with double meanings depending on which way the card is displayed. These cards are #2 Po/Ao, #5 Ku/Hina, #9 Mano, #38 Papa/Wakea , #44 'Ano'Ano. There are only 44 cards in the deck, and they should have added 5 more cards so each card would have had a single interpretation; but this is just my opinion.<br />3. I have a problem with the illustration of four cards listed below. <br />#16 Menehune: The card shows Menehune building a rock wall, and behind the Menehune setting rocks in place are Menehune carrying assorted sized rocks and putting them in piles according to their size_| Legend states that Menehune work for the Ali'i (royalty). The Menehune work all night for one shrimp  (for each of the Menehune), and any job that is not completed in one night is left undone, and the menehune work by passing rocks from hand to hand in a long chain that stretches from the quarry to the fish pond or rock wall being built<br />#22 Pele: The card showa a woman made from red-hot lava._| A more accurate depiction would be a photo of the Volcano and Caldera because Madame Pele can appear in three forms. The physical volcano, a woman of almost any age, or a small white dog.<br />#23 Laka: The illustration shows a woman with yellow dress,  bending over slightly to look at something to the right of the card. _| Laka is the goddess of the hula, and it would be more appropriate for her to be dancing the hula, and wearing a grass skirt.<br />#29 Mo'o: The Mo'o is on dry land holding a net in the water (to catch fish I suppose) The Mo'o is in assorted shades of green with red eyes and mouth. Sitting beside the Mo'o is a bare breasted woman with long hair, and green skin_| The Mo'o should be in the water because it reportedly lives in fish ponds, and the Mo'o should be solid black. The woman with the Mo'o should have a normal flesh tone and wearing a pink dress, and pink flower in her hair.<br />The illustrations on the other 40 cards are very good. The illustrations of #6 Hi'iaka, #12 Kanaloa, #15 Awa, #17 Ti,  #24 Ho'oponopono,  #35 Maui, #40 Kane, and  #41 Hina are PERFECT!<br />4. I have a problem with the interpretation of #5 Ku/Hina. The interpration quotes that Ku is the god of war. _| Ku is the god of growing plants. Legend states that during a famine; Ku says good-bye to his wife and children, then goes outside and stands on his head; then descends into the earth, and his wife repeatedly visits the place and cries for the loss of her husband. Later a breadfruit plant grows there (watered by her tears), and ends the famine. It was Kuka'Ilimoku who was the god of war.<br />I have been fascinated with Hawai'ian mysticism and spirituality for years. This will become apparent if you read my &quot;So you would like to study HUNA and change your life&quot; guide, and my two HUNA listmania lists, or reading my website [...]<br />I only use the name HUNA because many people are already familiar with the name; because of the writings of Max Freedom Long, Serge Kahili King, Charlotte Berney, Arlyn J. MacDonald, and others. These people will have a frame of reference to what I am discussing. If I had done the research Max Freedom long did; I would have named this system pule me mana ( pray with energy).<br />I do not believe the Hawaiian people had an official name for this form of mysticism. To the Hawaian people; this mystic approach to life was as natural as breathing.<br />Aloha nui loa. Two Bears	2004-02-27

Allan P. Lewis studied with a living kahuna. Clark Wilkerson studied with another kahuna. Serge Kahili King had a Hawaiian relative. Laura Kealoha Yardley studied wuth kahuna David Kaonohiokala Bray, and her grandmother which was Hawaiian, and others.<br />Myself; I studied almost all of the writings of MFL, and I see MFL as a sincere dedicated researcher; but in a few places; he made mistakes because of his imperfect understanding of Hawaiian Spirituality. There have been several important sources of information in MY HUNA practise.<br />1. MFL &quot;Secret Science Behind Miracles&quot; &amp; &quot;Secret Science At Work&quot;<br />2. Allan P. Lewis &quot;Clearing Your lifepath; With Kahuna Wisdom&quot; &amp; &quot;Living In Harmony; With Kahuna Wisdom&quot;<br />3. Clark Wilkerson &quot;Hawaiian Magic&quot;<br />4. Direct first hand experience when working with the system.<br />Page 13:&quot;There was no concept of a single &quot;God&quot; as taught by thr Christian Missionaries.&quot; _|This is NOT correct. The Hawaiians DID know of a single Creator (God if you prefer); but hey did not work with the single Creator because they believed that the spiritual powers above the Akua were beyond Human comprehension. In my research; I have seen the Creator's name spelled 5 different ways (AEO, EO, E'O, IAO, and IO) In my opinion the name E'O is the correct spelling. The ' represents a glottal stop which is pronounced as a short pause in speech.<br />Page 13: &quot;The Hawaiians had no concept of sin&quot; _|They did not recognise sin as portrayed by the &quot;christian&quot; Missionaries; but they did understand hurt. The ONE HUNA commandment is &quot;Harm nothing with hatred&quot;<br />Page 18, and throughout the book; Ms. MacDonald places a glottal stop before the names Unihipili (ooneheepeele), and Uhane (oohanee) There should not be a glottal stop before these names. The author does correctly spell the higher self 'Aumakua (Owmakooa)<br />Page 36:&quot;The 'Aumakua is centered in the right hemisphere of the brain.&quot; _| this is incorrect. The 'Aumakua does not reside inside the body. It is found 6 inches to 3 feet over the head. The Uhane is located in the brain, and the Uhihipili is located in the solar plexus.<br />Page 39:&quot;However, the 'aumakua will not interfere with the desires of the other selves unless it is asked.&quot; _|I have a list of times when the 'Aumakua has violated the person's free will.

Illness, Ward Off Evil Spirits and Much More	Books	1	14	22	N	Y	Ms. Morrison teaches magick; but NOT the ethics of magick.	I have MANY problems with this book.<br />Page ix: &quot;Kahunas practised the arts of the Huna&quot; _| The kahunas NEVER called their spiritual technology HUNA. The Kahunas would have called it ho'omanamana if they called it anything. The system called HUNA began in 1917 or 1918 by Max Freedom Long (MFL). MFL was trying to reclaim the lost secrets of the kahunas. The Hawaiian people would not discuss these spiritual matters with MFL for fear of persecution. The &quot;christian&quot; missionaries, and their puppets in the government made it ILLEGAL for the Hawaiians to practise their form of spiritualiy. MFL gave this system the name HUNA because Huna means secret. <br />MFL made several leaps in logic (I am fond of saying that in some places MFL added 2 and 2 and came up with 6). Such instances are --- 1. MFL's belief that Jesus was an initiated kahuna. 2. That Hawaiians are a lost tribe of Israel. 3. That HUNA was a lost tradition of &quot;christianity&quot;, and others.<br />Page x: &quot;I do not wish you to harm anyone very much with the darker spells, as it may be that they'll backfire and harm you instead. _| This author feels it is perfectly OK to to work magick on others against their will. This is NOT acceptable. May I remind you of a few things?<br />1. The one HUNA commandment is &quot;Harm No One And Nothing With Hate&quot; which I abbreviated to &quot;Harm Nothing with hatred&quot;.<br />2. A line from the Wiccan Rede says &quot;An ye harm none; do what ye will.&quot;<br />3. The young carpenter cautioned people correctly with &quot;Ye reap what ye sow (paraphrased)&quot;<br />4. India amd Tibet teaches the law of karma.<br />Page 5: &quot;If you can't visualize  a face clearly, then you can't do spells. It's as simple as that.&quot; _| Balderdash. Whether magick works or not depends on how much energy, emotion and intent you put into the magickal working.<br />Page 6: &quot;Wicca is the witchcraft you hear the most about these days. It is a nature religion, I feel, believes it's the one true faith. I never met a ruder, more self-righteous bunch of people in my life. I would have nothing to do with the Wiccans if I were you.&quot; _|Wicca is an invention of Gerald B. Gardner. a blending of witchcraft, mental mysticism, and freemasonry.<br />It is MY opinion that Ms. Morrison is not as enlightened as she believes herself to be; or she would not be so reactionary against people of another faith. Everyone must walk the path that is right for them.<br />Page 6-7: &quot;I received many letters from Wiccans over the years and they are so ignorant that they do not even realize that the brand of witchcraft I write about is an ancient belief predating theirs. They think my witchcraft is phony and doesn't work. That I try to promote beliefs (which I don't) and that in general I have no right to be writing my books._| The author DOES have a point; but she did not need to be so harsh. Wicca only goes back to 1949 when Gerald B. Gardner went public. Many wiccans are introduced to the one size fits all vision of witchcraft espoused by Silver Raven Wolf, and many other Wiccan authors today, and they are POORLY trained in how magick really works. It is NOT in the spell. The magick is in YOU; How much emotion, energy, and intent are you willing to put into the magickal working?<br />Page 7: &quot;I learned this pool game trick from a Kahuna in Hawaii who taught me to concentrate mt powers. After practicing concentration for a while, I killed a bee by concentrating on it. I willed it to die, and it did.&quot; _| The author is telling the truth about the power of magic. However; the Kahuna should have taught her the one HUNA commandment. To willfuly kill one of the Great Spirits creations for no reason is evil.<br />Page 24 lists a spell that I will quote part of.<br />&quot;Bring the man to the woman,<BR>O Amakua of the forests and<BR>     the oceans and the skies.&quot;<br />I have studied MANY mystical traditions (HUNA is onlyone of them); but throughout this book the author continually misspells the Hawaiian name for this guardian spirit. The correct spelling is 'Aumakua, and is pronounced (Owmakooa).<br />I would sincerely recommend that you allow this book to collect dust on the bookshelf.<br />If you choose to follow this book; then do so at your own peril; because I can do nothing more than try to warn you.<br />Aloha nui loa: Two Bears	2003-10-16

I did not give this book five stars for three reasons.<br />1. The user can NOT receive dramatic results from the book by reading and performing the exercizes once. You will need to go back and repeat the exercizes a few times until releasing becomes second nature. Unfortunately; the author or publisher did not include an index of exercizes. <br />This means you have to search and search through the book to find the exercizes. So until the author releases a second edition with a table of exercizes; use a hi-lighter, bookmarks, or copy the pages with the exercizes.<br />2. I found it very tiring; the author placed many testimonials interspersed in the book, and to read the book sans testimonials; it is difficult. <br />I think the author would have served the readers better if he had insert 5 or so testimonials as inserts in the text of the book, and placed all of the other testimonials in a seperate chapter or section of the book. This way; people that want to read testimonials could read them, and the others (such as me) could have ignored the section completely.<br />3. This mind technology is effective; but is incomplete; because it does not use the soul power achieve faster results.<br />Now I need to address some portions of the book.<br />Page 8: &quot;We are all unlimited beings&quot;. _| we are NOT unlimited beings. Only the Creator is unlimited; but I will say that we are far more powerful than 98% of the people think they are.<br />Page 19: &quot;We can have freedom and happiness now.&quot; _| I agree with that statement COMPLETELY.<br />Page 29: &quot;This natural ability to release our emotions was lost to most of us because, even though we did it automaticaly as young children without conscious control, our parents, teachers, friends, and society as a whole trained us out of it.&quot; _| I agree.<br />Page 54: &quot;Letting go gets easier to do the more you do it.&quot; _| This statement is absolutely correct; but in the beginning' you may literaly fight for every milimeter you gain! This is because you will literaly have to change the way you think and react to stimuli.<br />Page 71: &quot;Stop rushing past life&quot; _| This is correct. Most people are so busy in their mind chatter that they are rarely ever living in the present moment. <br />Page 102: &quot;Emotions are just emotions. They are not you, they are not facts, and you can let them go.&quot; _| I could not agree more! You are your soul, and your lifetime of choices that lead you to this destination.<br />Page 253: &quot;Here is a fictitious account of how programming can run amok. Let's say that, when you were a child, you has an abusive relative who just happened to be a tall gray-haired womam. Therefore, after interacting with her often, you make an unconscious decision to the effect that all tall gray-haired women are dangerous&quot; _| This anecdote is EXACTLY how we build up walls in our mind. Most people view the world's population as groups instead of individuals. Most people have faulty programming in their subconscious minds. This faulty programming CAN reach such extents; that some people are running through their life on automatic pilot, instead of living consciously.<br />Aloha nui loa: Two Bears	2003-10-03

Cut a limb from a tree and use it as a wand, use tealight or votive candles, use a kitchen knife for an athame, pick up two rocks to represent the God and Goddess, you might visit yard sales, and pick up ceramic figurines of birds, etc.<br />Page 173: &quot;Most magical people begin working with totem animals by choosing their favorite creature.&quot;<br />I thought this was to be a book about Wicca instead of a book on Shamanism. Furthermore; the totem animal chould choose to work with you; not the other way around.<br />Page 320: &quot;Reiki is s channeled form of energy healing that originated in Japan&quot;<br />I am a Master/Teacher or higher in five different forms of Reiki, and can state categoricaly that Reiki is not part of the Wicca system or vice versa.<br />Page 372: &quot;To understand where the concept of demons comes from, we have to look deep into history and the split between the Pagan belief system and Christian superstition used as a vehicle to control the people.&quot;<br />I have no use for &quot;christianity&quot;, but I am deeply offended that the author gives her belief credence; but relegate &quot;christianity&quot; to superstition.<br />Page 435: &quot;Citrine Purpose: Anti-nightmare, protection, psychism&quot;.<br />The Author has Citrine and Amethyst confused here. Citrine is healing, and works withthe 2nd and third chakras. Citrine is one of four stones that do not need to be cleansed of negativity.

I like this book; I am NOT entirely happy with it; but it is a well written volume.<br />Page 7: &quot;There is something different about a person who is meant to be a Native Healer. You are born with a special kind of power, gift, talent, and knowledge.&quot; _| I can not agree more. I received many beatings, and was put on medication (at the age of six!) for telling the truth about what was happening to me. It's as if you are living in the same world; but with a different set of rules.<br />Page 7: &quot;But a real medicine man should not have to identify himself as such. It is not the indian way.&quot; _| Medicine people will not identify themself as such for fear of offending their helping spirits.<br />Page 12: &quot;The path to becoming a Native healer is full of trials and tribulations, suffering and sacrifice.&quot; _| It takes time for the Shaman to develop compassion for their brothers and sisters; but I believe the Shamanic path is MUCH worse in the east (especially in the bible belt) than where medicine people are common.<br />Page 15: &quot;I have met people who claim they identified their &quot;totem&quot; through meditation or a tarot card reading, but they are only fooling themselves.&quot; _| I have never had a tarot card reading to discover my totem animal, so I will reserve comment. I CAN speak to discovering your totem animal via meditation. In meditation you will experience the totem animal you EXPECT. Your totem animal will NOT infrienge on your free will.<br />Page 31: &quot;To become a medicine man or woman you must be a lonely person because human beings won't really understand you.&quot; _| I think the author mis-wrote. I would substitute the words &quot;lonely person&quot; with the word loner. Just because a person is a loner; does not mean she or he is lonely.<br />Page 35: &quot;Some of the medicine people in the southwest use datura medicine.&quot; _| Datura is a halucinogenic, and will induce visions like other halucinogenics such as Peyote, Hayascua, and others. I do NOT recommend the use of halucinogenics. Anyone that can not journey in the spirit world without these crutches is not much of a shaman (in my opinion).<br />Page 35: &quot;but I did try peyote once with Stanley during one of his sacred ceremonies.

Many times the prospective medicine person is left to their own devices. If you experience things others do not; go in nature, and pray for guidance, then look for omens, and record your dreams (your spirit helpers can easily offer guidance through dreams).<br />Page 61: &quot;For me it became a calling into the medicine ways and an initiation into shamanhood.&quot; _| This Shamanic initiation idea drives me up a tree! A shaman can not make or initiate another shaman. If the spirits work with you; you are a shaman (no matter what you call yourself or others may call you). If the spirits do not work with you; you are NOT a shaman. It is that simple.<br />Chapter 6 &quot;The training Of Women Healers; Past And Present&quot; is a bit explicit.<br />Page 119: &quot;There are insane asylums in this country full of people who have become posessed, no matter how the White doctor tries to rationalize and explain it.&quot; _| I could NOT agree more.

It is often seen as a shadowy figure darting across the room, but many people simply dismiss it as a figment of their imagination. Thom further explains that the shadow comes in two forms human or a large cat.&quot; _| I am of the opinion these shadow entities are shape shifters, and will take on whatever appearance that will cause the most fear or panic.

Esmeralda Arana in her book &quot;The path: A Practical Approach To Sorcery&quot; reports being frightened by a large shadowy spider during a hypnogogic state.

Books	5	75	89	N	N	This will work for many; but prepare to work for it.	&quot;Happiness Is Free&quot; is a marvelous book with a simple system that helps readers work toward self mastery. However; this will NOT work for everyone. <br />Furthermore; the many people this program will work for may incorrectly believe turning your life around is easier that it is, and give up in frustration.<br />My suggestion is for you; to not read through the book one time and set it on the shelf, and believe you have solved your problems.<br />Do the exercizes, then take the baby steps, then keep taking these small steps for 6 months to a year, then look back and see how far you have progressed.<br />I wish to comment about various portions of the book.<br />Page 3: &quot;When I had studied various body centered disciplines including Yoga, Tai-Chi, Shiatsu. I had actively participated in various courses, including EST, Actualism, theta seminars and Rebirthing.&quot; _| Mr. Dwoskin and I have been down many similar or same paths. (Yoga, (Qigong instead of Tai Chi),( Kiatsu instead of Shiatsu), Actualism, Theta development, and Rebirthing.) I also did Reiki, Seichim, HUNA, Crystal healing, etc.<br />Page 7: &quot;Having cleared out the neegative fears, All the negative &quot;I cannots,&quot; I would focus right on the answer to every problem, and get it very quickly. And so my whole life turned around  from being depressed and sick&quot;_| I could NOT agree more. Let me caution you that turning that corner and walking out of the pits of despair is NOT easy. So prepare for a lot of internal work. This will fall away from you quickly looking back in hindsight, but at the time; success WILL be an inch at a time.<br />Page 15: &quot;I saw that the source of all this energy, of all intelegence was basicly harmonious' and that harmony was the rule of the universe.&quot; _| I can not say it better, or agree more.<br />Page 16: &quot;I saw that the only limitations I had were the ones I accepted.&quot; _| I agree 100%. No one fully understands the potential of the human body, mind, and spirit.<br />Page 18: &quot;It is such a delight when you're in tune, in harmony-you see God Everywhere!&quot; _| this is remarking the obvious. God IS everywhere (including you and me).<br />Page 21: &quot;We should only accept what he or she teaches once we prove it for ourselves through our own experience.&quot; _| Agreed. If this does not work for you; does not mean it does not work for anyone, each of us have different spiritual questions to answer.<br />Page 35: &quot;The more you can lead with your heart and not your mind in this process the easier it is to do.&quot; _| True; but the more you open your heart; the easier it is to be hurt until you master your mind.<br />Page 39: &quot;the original thought of &quot;I am seperate from the All&quot; necessarilt creates a feeling of lack and lonliness.&quot; _| Agreed. You will need to remind yourself at times that &quot;We are all connected&quot;. There is no lonliness only the perception of lonliness.<br />Page 65: &quot;Prayer is for those who need praying&quot; _| This is Mr. Levenson's opinion; but I do not share it.<br />Page 66: &quot;But Prayer admits duality-God is &quot;out there.&quot;&quot; _| I disagree. I see no contradition to say I am part of God. but there are other parts of God that hears and answers prayers.<br />Page 84: &quot;The ego is very tricky. It often talks us out of this path for a short period of time, sometimes a longer period of time.&quot; _| Agreed. Training the mind is long and ardurous.<br />Page 85: &quot;You give up limitation. You give up misery, but you never give up anything worthwhile.&quot; _| I disagree. You give up precious time that you can not regain. It would be MUCH better if parents would be gentle with what a child is taught to believe.<br />Page 86: &quot;You nust have a very strong desire to change, because you are such a victim of habit&quot; _| That is only 1/3 of the picture. Desire is NOT enough. To change you also need Courage to take proper actions on the new path you have chosen, and Perseverence to keep taking those small steps until you can walk and then run.<br />Page 87: &quot;The best place to grow is right where you are. The best time is now.&quot; _| Could not agree more. You can not say I will take those large steps when I get there, but if you continue living on autopilot; you never get to the point where you can take those large impressive steps. Crawl when you can, then walk.<br />Page 90: &quot;The more you grow, the less you need to grow.&quot; _| I disagree. the more I grow toward mastery,  the more work I see to do.   Every answer tends to create more questions.<br />Page 106: &quot;Everyone wants a continuous, constant, eternal hapiness with no sorrow whatsoever&quot; _| I know this is a cliche; but &quot;You only appreciate the mountaintop after walking through the valley&quot;.<br />Page 131: &quot;The best way to increase our capacity to love is though understanding ourselves.&quot; _| A better analysis is <BR>&quot;Are you; your own best friend?&quot; You can't love or respect someone else until you love or respect yourself&quot; Speaking from experience here.<br />Mahalo: Two Bears	2002-11-27

I have seen Amethyst's, Labradorite, Smoky Quartz, Obsidian, Raindow Obsidian, Ametrine, etc; lose their coloration with use. <br />2.

On page 125-126 the author discusses Tigers Eye, and Cat's Eye as if both stone are one and the same.<br />This is not so. It's true that both Tigers eye, and Cat's eye are asbestos fibers in silicon dioxide; but the appearance, and price varies greatly.<br />In Cat's eye the fibers are straight, and the stone is more eye like in appearance. This is a gem quality stone at gem quality prices!<br />In Tigers Eye: the fibers are crumpled or twisted. I have picked up nice specimens of Tiger's Eye in four different colors as cheaply as 75 cents each!<br />Implying that Cat's Eye and Tiger's Eye are the same stone is like saying that Peridot and Olivine are the same stone.

The author postulates that Wicca and Druidry has endured more than 1000 years of persecution. This may be true for Druidry, but Wicca has only been around for that past 53 years. <br />Wicca did not exist until Gerald Gardner wrote his series of books after the anti-witchcraft laws were overturned in England. From my studies; Wicca appears to be a combination of mental mysticism, Freemasonry, and Witchcraft.<br />2. This author completely ignores the tools used in Druidry.<br />3. I believe this author read too much Wiccan literature and incorporated it into his vision of Druidry.<br />Wiccans believe in both a God and Goddess, Druids acknowledge a single creator (based on other druid material I have read).	2002-11-25

The Author lists the use of salt water to cleanse your crystals on page 54. I do not recommend this method because salt is a corrosive agent, and repeated cleansing in salt water could break down the lattice structure of crystals. <br />I DO recommend cleansing stones by the following methods.<br />a. smudging them  in the smoke of a purifying herb or incense.<br />b. placing the crystals in sunlight.<br />c. burrying them in the ground so the negative energies can be transmuted.<br />2. I wish the author had listed the hardness of the assorted stones. This way you could use assorted stones of similar hardness so they did not damage one another. It would not be wise to carry a peice of Clear Quartz in a pocket with a peice of Moldavite. Moldavite is only 5.5 on the hardness scale where Quartz is a 7.0, Boji stones are 7.4. Ruby is 9, and Diamond is 10.<br />3. This book with 700+ pages is quite difficult to hold and read.

I DID find chapter 10 &quot;The Moldavite Letters&quot; very interesting because I too have noticed changes in myself in the last two months of carrying a peice of moldavite in my pocket; Two Bears.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2002-07-08

I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that is interested in HUNA as a way of life.<br />I wish to commend Ms. Berney for being the only HUNA author that began in the steps of Max Freedom Long (MFL) for gathering information from Hawaiian sources and including a subset of the Akua (deities) the Hawaiians acknowledged. <br />&quot;Hawaiian Magic And Spirituality&quot; Scott Cunningham has a more complete list of the Akua, a list of various types of kahunas. and even information about the little people (the menehune) of Hawaii.<br />To be an effective HUNA practitioner you must bring the three selves into harmony. Ms. Berney gives simple exercizes in assisting the three selves reach harmony and balance.<br />Each of the three selves has a distinct job to do in crafting an effective HUNA prayer action. <br />The Uhane (middle self) decides what will be prayed for. Select your prayer picture wisely. Choose a prayer picture as if the prayer has already been manifested (This allows the Aumakua (high self) to use the path of least resistance to manifest your prayer.<br />The Unihipili (low or basic self) gathers a surcharge of mana (Hawaiian term for universal lifeforce energy), then sends the energy and the prayer picture to the Aumakua.<br />The Aumakua will take the surcharge and mana, and ramp it up to mana loa, and uses the prayer picture, and the mana loa to bring your prayer picture into manifestation on the physical plane.<br />Most of the prayer actions fail because the Unihipili has complexes and fixations (guilt, fear, shame, wrong ideas about money, etc), and feels unworthy of requesting help, and will not send the prayer picture and mana to the Aumakua. The Aumakua tries to maintain harmony and balance, and will not assist in prayer actions that violate harmony and balance.<br />On page 72; Ms. Berney lists the HUNA vow that her teachers taught her. If you want to memorize and live by her vow; be my guest because it has some wonderful precepts. However; I recommend people memorize a four word tenet &quot;Harm nothing with hatred&quot;. If you will live by those four words; you will keep all of the precepts in the HUNA vow.<br />I have two nitpicks about this book.<br />1. In places; she seems to imply there was one kind of kahuna. There were various kinds of kahuna. The title &quot;kahuna&quot; means master or expert.<br />2. This book has one weak area. That of assisting you in clearing the Unihipili of complexes and fixations. Ms. Berney recommends that you read the books by John Bainbridge, or visit a Vector Counselor.<br />There are simple rituals you can perform in order to persuade the Unihipili that you are aware of your errors, and have a sincere desire to make ammends.

I have been around the world of alternative healing for years, and a book like this is very disappointing to me personally.<br />I bought this book to see what the author would have to say about the four alternative healing methods that I am most involved with (HUNA, Qigong, Reiki, and Seichim).<br />Chapter 2 is dedicated to to HUNA, and based on what I read; she used two sources for HUNA information \\"The Secret Science Behind Miracles\\" Max Freedom Long, and \\"Huna: A Beginners Guide\\" Enid Hoffman.<br />Max Freedom Long (MFL) was a tireless researcher, and he spent the last 52 years of his life trying to reclaim the wisdom of the kahunas. Unfortunately Max had several problems.<br />1. MFL was a ha'ole, and the Hawaiians would not talk to him for fear of persecution. This was only 97 years after the \\"christian\\" missionaries did their good deed of civilizing the \\"savages\\", and castigating the beliefs of the hawaiians as Satan worship.<br />2. MFL was raised \\"christian\\", and he allowed his beliefs to influence his perceptions of HUNA. In some of MFL's volumes; he goes so far to say that Jesus was an initiated Kahuna.<br />3. MFL completely overlooked the role of the Akua(gods and goddesses acknowledged by the Hawaiians. The Hawaiians knew of a single creator; but worked through their Aimakua, Po'e Aumakua, and the Akua. They believed the levels above the Akua was beyond human comprehension. MFL did not acknowledge any levels above the Po'e Aumakua.<br />Ms. Hoffman took the writings of MFL, and expanded on it to the best of her ability; but unfortunately she was using faulty material as a base.<br />Ms. Coddington constantly refers to the spiritual beliefs of the Kahunas as \\"the Huna\\". HUNA is only a name that was given to this by MFL.<br />I am unaware of the real name the Hawaiians gave their spiritual beliefs. The Hawaiian word for religion was Ho'omana. If I had done the research that MFL did; I would have called the Hawaiian form of spirituality as Pulemana (which means to pray with mana).<br />If you are interested in HUNA; please see my two HUNA listmania lists, or my \\"So you would like to\\" area about HUNA.<br />I was very distressed to see her list \\"Accupuncture\\" in the \\"New Age\\" area on page 143.

Lewis made some nice comments about the 52 years of HUNA research done by Max Freedom Long. <br />It IS true that Max was a tireless researcher; but Max did not have the entire picture. He went to the islands in 1917 to teach School. Occasionaly he would overhear the Hawaiians comment about miraculous feats performed by various Kahunas. When he would ask the Hawaiians for more details they would stop talking for fear of persecution from a ha'ole. Max did a wonderful job in reclaiming as much as he did under the circumstances.<br />Max made two major mistakes. His &quot;christian&quot; beliefs caused him to believe Jesus was an initiated kahuna. He completely overlooked the role of the Akua (gods and goddesses as in Hina, Kane, Kanaloa, Ku, Lono, Pele).<br />You have to understand; this was only 97 years after the &quot;christians&quot; did their good deed of trying to destroy the native Hawaiian culture, and outlawed practises performed by the kahunas because of fear.<br />Ha'ole means breathless one: This is in regard to the missionary priests that did not breathe deeply to accumulate a surcharge of mana before prayer to help the prayer  come into manifestation, as the Kahuna Pule (prayer kahunas) did.<br />Page 10: Mr. Lewis is absolutely correct about the 10 parts of a human being. <br />The 10 parts are; The three selves (Unihipili, Uhane, and Aumakua), three aka bodies, three voltages of mana (mana, mana mana, and mana loa, and the physical body; 3+3+3+1=10.<br />Page 82.

I expect to see many negative reviews of this book \\"The Path: A Practical approach to Sorcery\\"; because many people will read the title, and incorrectly assume this book is full of spells, incantations, and curses. Well those people simply do not understand what magick (or sorcery in Ms. Arana's nomenclature) is all about.<br />Many people think magick is chanting an incantation and a $100 bill falls to the ground in front of you. Most people have the similar misconception of what Alchemy was about (transmuting base metals like brass and lead into gold); that was only a tiny part of what alchemy was about. True alchemy was about transmuting (purifying) the soul in order to escape the cycle of reincarnations.<br />Now with that out of the way; this book is a wonderful essay of one woman's long pilgrimage from darkness into the light, and I recommend it to you HIGHLY!<br />One part of this book disturbs me greatly. Ms. Arana repeatedly talks of one of her mentors (the books of Carlos Castaneda). On page 119 Ms. Arana states \\"Those people who thought that his books were about the use of psychotropic drugs missed the boat entirely.\\" I read many of Dr. Castaneda's books, and freely admit that I missed the boat.<br />I am NOT in favor of people taking psychotropic drugs at all. The drugs WILL allow you to perceive and interact with other realms; but you will lose any control over the experience, and I can tell you from first hand experience that not all of those beings are sweetness and light!<br />This book is NOT a complete path to mastery; but will greatly assist you in taking your first stumbling steps towards mastery. I am fond of saying \\"The more one works toward self mastery; the more inner work s/he sees that needs to be done\\" Two Bears.<br />Please be patient while I point out a few things in the book.<br />Page 2. \\"I began to have lucid dreams or what people commonly refer to as out of body experiences.\\" Lucid dreamimg is not a full out of body experience where the astral body seperates from the physical body. According to Stephen LaBerg (the man that coined that coined the term \\"Lucid dreaming\\" if memory serves.) states that lucid dreaming is one of many gateways to out of body experiences.<br />Page 3. \\"I do not pretend to be a guru of any sort.\\" I could NOT agree more! There are NO shortcuts to self mastery. You MUST do the HARD work yourself. So prepare to do a lot of internal work!<br />Page 28. \\"I have asked the Elemental Force to help to help mr change something about myself,\\" Just in order for you to understand her nomenclature; this energy has been called by countless names (Akasha, Ch'i, Itaki, Ki, Mana, Nuwati, Prana, etc.)<br />Page 34. \\"If one stops the internal dialogue, one \\"stops the world\\".\\" It is VERY important to visit the silence; because in the silence you can re-program what is allowed to pass through your filter, then release negative emotions such as anger, hatred, bigotry, tendencies to commit violence, etc. I can verify this from first hand experience.<br />Page 49. \\"During REM sleep, the body protects itself by paralyzing the voluntary muscles so that when you dream, you don't start acting out what is occuring in your dream and injure yourself.\\" Ms. Arana is one of the very few people to correctly identify the purpose of sleep paralysis.<br />Page 71. \\"First imagine that the mind is like the hard drive of a computer; a hard drive with a massive but finite capacity.\\" This statement is in error. The mind is infinite. It contains all of the information of the current lifetime and all previous lifetimes (The brain is not the mind. The brain is only the operating system to access the mind.). A person that refuses to accept the notion of other realms will stop experiencing them, a person that has tendencies to hold grudges, commit violence, etc; over time will build walls that limit their their potential to experience other acts such as mercy, forgiveness. love tolerance, etc; This in no way means thehard drive is full (You are only tearing down self imposed walls). By going into the silence and reprogramming what our filters will allow to come into our perception; we can change internaly that begins to change our physical reality. The occultists had it right in the statement \\"As above, so below; as within so without.\\"<br />Page 85. \\"I have never seen anything in my lucid dream resembling the \\"predator\\" or the \\"sucker\\".\\" I must disagree (one of the few page numbers I forgot). Ms. Arana talks of the predators or gardners that strips away energy from the human beings energy body and uses it as food for them. On another page she relates the story while in a hypnogogic state that she saw a huge black spider that came through the wall that terified her, and she willed herself to wake up, knowing it wasn't real.<br />It was real.

A real roller coaster	This book tells a WONDERFUL story of a white medical doctor caring for an indian child with pneumonia. When the child began his recovery; the boy's father tried to pay the doctor, and Dr. Brown refused payment because of the way the indians had been cheated and mistreated by the government that made treaties and habitually broke them, and white settlers.<br />The boy's father was stunned by the doctors kindness, and insisted on giving him a pipe bag with bead and quill work. (A pipe bag is traditionaly made from leather with two segments or pockets if you prefer. Traditionaly; the pipe bowl, and stem are kept separate, and are only put together when you pray with the pipe.). This book tells the story of this pipe bag (allegedly belonging to Crazy Horse), and the story of the three people that cared for this pipe bag before returning it the Sioux.<br />This book also tells the story of Lionel Little Eagle (the third keeper of the pipe bag), and his beloved wife \\"Tammy\\" that was dying of cancer. <br />This book takes you on a roller coaster of emotions. In some places you will laugh hystericaly (as in 'Hey You' on page 37, 'Old Coyote's encounter with the kitchen boss' on page 46 and others. In other places prepare to find tears welling up in your eyes where Mr. Little Eagle relates the story of his wife's passing. and  teaching \\"Trapper\\" (the son of Mr. Little Eagle, and Tammy\\" why they use the pipe (like making a telephone call to God), and Trapper picks up the pipe and puts it to his ear like a phone and wants to talk to his mom.<br />There are many nice illustrations.<br />On pages 59-62; Mr. Little Eagle relates one of the best versions I have seen of the White Buffalo Woman legend that I have seen.<br />In my humble opinion; if this book does not reach you; you do not have an open mind and heart.<br />However; with the platitudes mentioned above; I am disappointed with some portions of this book.<br />1. On page 47-48 Mr. Little Eagle relates the words of an elder that states in olden times the pipe was much larger about the size of a child's head, and his anger about non indians having the pipe. Mr. Little Eagle does not seem to share the attitudes of the elder because on page 9; he refers to himself as \\"a simple member of the human race\\" which is quite similar to mine \\"A human being; doing the best I can.\\"<br />a. I know a gentlman that mines the sacred stone in the pipestone quarries (He sent me a photocopy of his permit to mine the stone). According to my acquaintance; it is extremely unusual to find veins of pipestone (Catlinite) more than 3 inches thick, and in order to get the sacred stone; they sometimes have to go through veins of quartzite up to 8 feet thick to reach the three inch vein.<br />b. Attitudes of anger and bigotry as expressed by the elder is making the problem worse not better. I want to see Nick Black Elk's vision of the flowering tree, and people living together in peace and harmony come to pass. People (indian or not, elder or not that have anger and hatred for non indians carrying the pipe in a sacred manner is causing disharmony. Evelyn Eaton the author of \\"I Send A Voice\\" relates her encounter with Native American anger and bigotry that was directed toward her because she carried a pipe. I have received many vitriolic comments from alleged indians after reading some of my reviews.<br />2. On page 142; Mr. Little Eagle tells of his meeting Wallace Black Elk the \\"grandson\\" of Sioux Holy Man Nick Black Elk. Wallace Black Elk is NOT the grandson of Nick Black Elk. I have VERY much respect for wicasa wakan (holy man) Nick Black Elk. I have NO respect for this new age flim flam man that inflates his ancestry to make himself look better. I know a man that was named by Ben Black Elk (the son of Nick Black Elk), and I know the real family of Nick Black Elk have been confronting this myth for years.

In my humble opinion; the BEST way to reach harmony is to put the past behind us, and go forward into the future; there all races teach one another, and explain why things are considered sacred, and what it means to use a pipe in a sacred manner. We can only do this if we open our hearts and minds, and allow the past injustices to remain in the past.

I am a Shaman; but Wicca was one of the many faiths I explored.<br />I have several positive, negative, and neutral things to say about this book, so I will seperate them into three lists.<br />Here are some of the things I like about this book. I am limited to 1000 words. ;-)<br />1. The altar layout illustration on page 64 is nice and complete. (You should not allow this to cause you undue concern. Start where you are; even if you have nothing more than a birthday candle, matches, and use your finger to cast a circle. You can always add tools as you find them, or feel the need to add them.)<br />2. This is one of the very few books to correctly identify the invoking, and banishing pentagrams. (I can count the number of books that got something this simple correct on one hand. Banishing prntagrams are always drawn widdershins (counter clockwise).)<br />3. I HIGHLY praise this book for teaching the shielding exercize on page 77. (I wish more authors would teach simple shielding techniques to assist against psychic attacks.)<br />4. I praise the authors for discussing the belief factor on page 82. (It is impossible to have faith in something you do not believe.)<br />5. I HIGHLY praise the authors for discussing the perils in some forms of divination as in Ouija boards, spirit tapping, etc. (If you are interested in divination; I would HIGHLY recommend that you set up a shield (as described on page 77) before practicing divination to protect you from evil and negativity in the area.)<br />Here are the problems I have with the book.<br />1. The book is heavy and cumbersome. (I would have preferred for the book to be in a smaller format with more pages. The wide pages put a lot of stress on the wrist when trying to hold the book.)<br />2. On page 108; the authors claim that Wicca is a nature worshiping religion. (Uh... ahem... er... ;-) I don't think so. I have never heard of or saw a Wiccan worshiping a tree or a stream. They always cast a circle andinvoke Deity.)<br />3. On page 74; the authors discuss white and black magick. (In my opinion; magick is simply magick. the white or black connotation only comes in depending on the magickians intent.)<br />Here are some of the things I am neutral about, and I hope you will consider.<br />1. On Page 75; the authors discuss a visualization of roots growing from the base of the spine into the ground. (I would recommend you switch the visualization of roots from the feet growing into the earth (because your feet are already on the ground).)<br />2. On page 80; the authors talk of cleansing the athame with salt water. (Salt is corrosive and could lead to the blade of the athame rusting. I would suggest that you channel your energy into the athame to bless it and raise it's level of vibration, or smudge it by passing it through the smoke of a purifying incense as in Copal, Frankinsence, or Sage.)<br />3. On page 116; and others; the authors refer to the energy used as chi. (Ch'i is only one of the dozens of names this universal lifeforce energy has been called over the past 5,000+ years. Here are some of the more common names (Akasha, ch'i, Itaki, Ki, Mana, Manitou, Nuwati, Orenda, Orgone, Prana, Qi Ruach, and many others.))<br />E-Mail me if you have questions or comments; Two Bears.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2002-03-30

I bought this book because I wanted a view of Shamanism as practised in this area of the world because the term Shaman was coined by the Tungus people of Siberia.<br />The rituals and ceremonies are simple and could be performed by just about anyone.<br />Chapter 6 deals with assorted forms of diviniation.<br />The book is clearly written and concise; however; the author uses terms used by the Mongolian Shamans throughout the book, and in a few places; this is tiring and tedious.<br />My only real complaint deals with page 91 &quot;A more potent hallucinogen, the mukhomar mushroom has been connected with Siberian and Mongolian shamanism from ancient times.&quot; (In my opinion; hallucinogenics are NOT needed, and NOT recommended.)<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2002-02-13

The account of the little girl that did not want to return home (and others) were touching.<br />I did not give this book five stars because<br />1. In my opinion; this book is written like an advertizement to get people to take courses in Shamanism from the Foundation for Shamanic Studies (Ms. Ingerman is one of the FSS instructors).<br />Dr. Michael Harner (and the other authors recommended in my shamanism listmania list) puts the tools in your hands.<br />2. I have done soul retrievals; but I hate to do them (because the Shaman can not tell how much misery the person can stand (there is a lot of bad memories and emotional baggage the recepient has to deal with), and if you overload the recepient; the soul fragments will leave again). I would much rather teach the person Shamanic practices where they can conduct their own soul retrieval peice meal with the support of their totem (power) animal.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2002-02-04

Rabbi David Aaron writes about the Kabbalah, but does not provide enough information to practise the Kabbalah.<br />I have read several books on the Kabbalah, and many more books on other forms of mysticism.<br />He calls the bottom sephiroth &quot;Malkus&quot;. The other sources I have read on the Kabbalah call it Malkuth. The material about the 10 Sephiroth appears to be sound (based on my limited knowledge of the subject).<br />I wish he had given meditations, and directions to assist people in practising the Kabbalah; but I fully understand why he did not (even though I do not agree with it) <br />Traditionaly; the Kabbalah is not taught until a person is 40 years of age, and is well grounded mentaly and Spiritually. This was tradition. Not a rule set in concrete.<br />However; there needs to be books that teach this knowledge to people that seek it, and do not have easy access to Kabbalists.<br />I only have one minor complaint.<br />The Rabbi habitually states that Abraham was the first person to acknowledge a single Creator. This is true in the faith of Judaism.<br />However; there are other faiths that predate Judaism that acknowledged a single Creator (not everyone was an &quot;idolator&quot;. Using Mr. Aaron's label). Abram (later called Abraham) was born in the 10th generation (after the flood), Genesis Chapter 11 gives the lineage from Shem (Noah's son) to Abraham. So Judaism could only be about 3600-3800 years old. Depending on which set of numbers you accept.<br />Taoism and acknowledgement of &quot;The Tao&quot; goes back 5000 years or more. Taoist prinnciples are in the treatise on internal medicine written in 2445 BCE.<br />The American Indians many of the nations did not have a written language until recently. but they acknowledged the Great Spirit, and passed on the information oraly. <br />Many people become confused when they see indians mentioning Wakan Tanka, Manitou, Untalanti, Ogedoda, and many other names. There were more than 500 AmericanIndian nations speaking 175-200 languages. It is only natural they would use different names.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2002-02-03

Part of these tactics is a computer game (in Enders mind) in  mock battle against the buggers. What is really happening; is that his playing the game is directing real soldiers in real battle against the buggers, and Ender is unaware that he is indirectly responsible for the death of millions on both sides of the war.<br />After Ender learns what he has done, he starts a new philosophy or religion that he calls \\"Speaker for the dead\\".<br />As a speaker foe the dead; he is asked to come to a planet (which if he lands; he will have to spend the rest of his life there because of the Descolada virus that causes lifeforms to mutate into symbiotic lifeforms, and any person trying to leave the surface will be destroyed because the hegemony will not allow this contaigion to spread to other planets) to speak on behalf of two humans that were killed by the Pequienos (an indiginous sentient lifeform that looks like a mixture between pig and man.

On pages 84-89; Mr Volkmar discusses the Chakras. (Based on my experience the Chakra model of distributing universal lifeforce energy throughout the body is incorrect. I accept the Chinese model of meridians as distributing energy throughout the body. If the Chakra system were correct; then Accupuncture and accupressure would not work.)<br />4.

It IS true that halucinogenics will open the doorway to the visionary experience, but IMHO the would-be Shaman loses any control over the visionary experience, and a Shaman without control over the experience is IMHO a worthless Shaman. <br />I am a firm believer in the philosophy that drugs are not necessary (never were necessary for me). I personaly feel that it is an insult (interpret the word sin if you prefer) to yourself and your Creator to add unnecessary toxins to your body.<br />I love Frank Foolscrow's reply when somoene asked him if he used peyote.

Not in my opinion. ;-(<br />First; Dr. Wesselman is unable to decide whether to write about HUNA (as espoused by Serge Kahili King (not much regard for this author when it comes to HUNA).), or to write about Core Shamanism as espoused by Michael Harner. I have a high amount of respect for Michael Harner, and the Foundation for Shamanic Studies.<br />Second; These experiences happened to Dr. Wesselman, and he had no control over the experiences. The Shaman MUST have control over the experience (either by his/her conscious will, or by getting help from his/her totem (power)animal that protects and guides the Shaman on journeys into the Otherworld. Sometimes the Shaman has to be the 800 pound gorilla and tell the spirits where to get off. A shaman without the inner strength and will to do what must be done is a worthless Shaman.<br />Third. Every visionary experience was to visit Nainoa living about 5000 years in the future. To me this is very suspect. When I began seeing and hearing the spirits 40 years ago, I encountered many different spirits. Some were friendly, and many were not.<br />fourth; The largest portion of the book occurs 5000 years in the future (after the fall of western civilization) with elephants, spotted tigers, and many other animals today only found in circuses and zoos. It is improbable if not impossible for those animals to be the decendents of the animals in circuses and zoos. I say that for two reasons.<br />a. the gene pool would not be sufficient to sustain the colony.<br />b. If western civilization falls, and people get hungry, you will see the people killing animals for food, and decimating the forests for wood to use as fuel to keep warm in cold weather, and use for cooking the food they can get, and animals in cages would be food the hunter gatherers could get much easier than wild animals in the forests.<br />I encourage questions and comments about reviews; Two Bears.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2001-12-24

This book has some wonderful techniques to change the dream of you life. In my opinion; many of the techniqies in other shamanic books are better.<br />However; I have several problems with this book.<br />1. Mr. Perkins is an environmentalist wacko. (I agree with Mr. Perkins that nature should be protected, and I am all in favor or protecting the environment. However; there needs to be a balance somewhere, and nature should not be given precedence over the needs of human beings.)<br />2. Mr. Perkins is a proponent of the halucinogenic he called Awahusca. (The real name of this plant is Hayascua sometimes called \\"the vine of death\\". In \\"Reality Is Just an Illusion: The World of Shamans, Ghosts and Spirit Guides\\" by Chuck Coburn. Mr Coburn relates the experience where he took Hayascua admisistered by a tribal Shaman. In \\"The Way Of The Shaman\\" by Michael Harner. Mr. Harner relates the story of having Hayascua administered by a Conibo tribal Shaman.)<br />3. I am NOT a proponent of the use of any halucinogenic substance because these substances open the doorway; but the would-be Shaman loses any control of the visionary experience. Allow me to quote Frank Foolscrow a wicasa wakan (holy man) of the Teton Sioux; after someone asked him if he used the halucinogenic cactus; peyote \\"I do not need drugs.

Ms. Rysdyk completely ignored the subject of protection.

You should cast a medicine wheel and call in the white light or smudge the area to protect your body while you are out and about. If you want help with this E-Mail me.)<br />2. Ms. Rysdyk completely ignored the subject of integrity. (When you give your word to the spirits; they expect you to keep it. To use a Shamanic motto &quot;Walk your talk&quot;.)<br />3. On page 57 Ms. Rusdyk relates the journey to get help from her power animal in getting a new job. (I perfer the term &quot;Totem Amimal&quot;. The Spirits are there to help when you need it.

(I wish more magick books dealt with the ethics of magick)<br />Page 3-4: \\"The Craft is accepting, generous, and loving. It's gentle, unobtrusive and supportive. It's an ethical way of life<BR>that, once embraced, brings immeasurable joy and wonder to everyday living. Simply Put, the Craft is a serious religion.\\"<br />Page 4: \\"Magic on the other hand, is defined as the change of any condition by ritual means. It's nothing more than a simple manner of channeling focused energy toward a specific goal. In fact Christians do it all the time. They pray for something and they get it. Whether God answers their prayers or not is anybody's guess\\" (I wish to thank Ms. Morrison for having the courage to put this in print, and taking magick out if the supernatural arena.)<br />Page 7-8 lists a fairly complete version of the Wiccan Rede.<br />Ms. Morrison Suggesting that people use what they have as substitutions. Here is one such example.<br />Page 61 \\"If you can't find dried chamomile, don't fret. Just pick up a box of Celestial Blends Sleepy-Time Tea at the supermarket. It's made of chamomile and will work just as well.\\"<br />(Scott Cunningham (another Wiccan author) in one of his books relates the story of using a butter knife to cast a circle after forgeting his athame. The power is in you. Not in powerful spells or that you use expensive tools. If the Wiccan path resonates with you. Start where you are.) <br />Throughout the book Ms. Morrison cautions people about various herbs that are dangerous. ( I am very glad to see that. Just because herbs are natural; doesn't mean they are always safe. A little digitalis from the herb Foxglove can save a heart patient's life. Too much would be fatal.)<br />Page 97: \\"This tool isn't something we purchase. It isn't something we cull from a tree or create of our own accord. Yet it holds unsurpassed magical power -- magical power so advanced that nothing else comes close. This tool, of course is the human brain.\\" (Well put, and I could not agree more! I will only add that meditation and visualization exercizes will enhance your mental focus.)<br />-----<BR>I do question the following sections in the book.<br />1. Why does Ms. Morrison place the spells in the text of the book? (In my opinion a separate section of spells would make it easier for people to find what they are looking for.)<br />2. Why are there 13 complete Esbat rituals in the book? (One Esbat ritual with a seperate chart of colored altar cloths, candle colors. flowers, etc used on the altar would have been sufficient.)<br />3. Why does Ms. Morrison list a chart of dream symbols on pages 179-184? (Everyone's dream symbology is individual to them based on their previous life experiences. If two people dream of dogs, the dream interpretation may be radicaly different; especialy if one person always perceived dogs as loyal companions, and the other person had been attacked by a dog.)<br />4. Pages 189-191 about stones.<br />a. Green Agate. (Is this the Green Moss Agate?)<br />b. Blue Agate (Is this the Blue Lace Agate?)<br />c. Apache Tears. (This stone is also called Obsidian by lapidaries.)<br />d. Adventurine. (This stone is also called Green Quartz by lapidaries.)<br />-----<BR>I perceive three weak areas in the book.<br />1. teaching the readers how to raise and direct power. Magick is like a bank. You  can only get out what you put in. <br />2. Ms. Morrison uses word pictures to describe altar layouts. Many people are visual and need illustrations.<br />3. I don't recall Ms. Morrison encouraging readers to keep a book of shadows or creating their own spells.<br />Personaly; I would suggest that you add \\"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\" by ScottCunningham to your library to fill in the weak areas of this book.<br />-----<BR>I was disappointed  to read on page 77 of \\"The Craft\\"; Ms. Morrison suggests using three drops of  your blood in the consecration of your athame. <br />In my opinion; blood rites have no business in Wicca; ecause the rede stresses harming none (including yourself).<br />(...)<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2001-11-21

A more youthful appearance is only one of the benefits.<br />Now these exercizes will NOT make someone in their 80s appear as youthful as someone in their 30s; but is it not uncommon for somone to turn the clock (appearance wise) back 10-20 years.<br />Please E-Mail me if you have questions or comments about this review.

If you want a speedy (but intensive) workout that is still in the Yoga model of exercize check out the five exercizes in either of these books.<br />&quot;The Ancient Secret Of The Fountain Of Youth&quot; Peter Kelder<br />&quot;The Five Tibetans&quot; Christopher Kilham<br />Both books describes the same exercize regimen but calls them by two different names.

I dispise writing negative reviews; but one that refuses to stand for the truth will fall for anything. This is a hodgepodge of myths circulating in the Reiki community. I happen to be a Master/Teacher of five forms of Reiki, and have the certificates to prove it! I have stuffed my certificates in a mailing tube; because if the heat emanating from my hands is not enough to convince someone I am a Reiki Master; then the pretty peices of paper will not convince them either. Where to begin? 1. If a Reiki practitioner EVER uses the \\"Reiki Finish\\" on you or an aquaintance; please contact the authorities. No Reiki practitioner of Master should EVER touch the breasts or genitals. 2. On the page introducing Virginia Samdahl (the technical advisor for the book); the information is simply FLAT wrong. Ms. Samdahl claimed to be the first occidental to receive mastership in 2,500 years. Everyone that knows anything about Reiki; admits that Sensei Mikao Usui discovered the system known as Reiki, Sensei Usui was not born until 1865 (136 years ago). Far less than the alleged 2,500 years. 3. the story of Sensei Usui's encounter with the beggar king in the slums is pure ... 4. the story of Larry Arnold's incident with the bee sting (He has alergic reactions to bee venom). Reiki CAN do wonders. I have seen astounding things many times, but Reiki 99.999% of the time will NOT work anywhere near fast enough to override an alergic reaction. The energy used in Reiki gives the recepient's own healing system a kick start. 5. Reiki is NOT, and should NEVER be used in place of proper health care. Any Reiki practitioner or master that tells you not to go to the doctor or to throw away your medication is a fool, and you should RUN (not walk) away from that person. Reiki is extremely simple. The channeling of universal lifeforce energy to the recepient for healing. ... ... ... Two Bears. Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2001-08-29

At this; the author does a fair job. Unfortunately; the author gets several things wrong on the Sioux side of the equation. 1. Throughout this book; the Lakota Sioux name for the Great Spirit Wakan Tanka is spelled as Wakantanka. 2. On page 35 the author associates water with the west of the medicine wheel. the books I respect link Earth with the west direction. 3. On page 46 the autor talks of four virgins cutting down the Cottonwood tree for the Sundance ceeremony. A young girl makes only the first cut, and she represents the White buffalo Woman that brought the pipe to the Sioux. 4. On page 50 the author talks of the four directions, and doesn't mention two more directions Sky and Earth until page 53. When I pray with the pipe I offer smoke to the seventh direction (the center) because the Grear Spirit is everywhere. This last statement is only my opinion. 5. Page 50-51 places the colors differently. I use the colors as spelled out by Lakota Sioux holy man Nick Black Elk. Black in the west, white in the north, red in the east, and yellow in the south. You can see this form of medicine wheel by looking at the cover of &quot;Native Wisdom&quot; Ed McGaa. Ed McGaa is a member of the Sioux nation. Now that my nitpicks have been cleared out of the way I wish to compliment the author for the following portions of the book. 1. Pages 53-55 The author tells the truth about the three most important plants used by the Sioux. Sweetgrass, sage, and tobacco. 2. The author tells the truth about what tatanka (the buffalo) really meant to the people. The indians made their tipis, clothing, moccasins, from the buffalo hide. the Sioux made needles and beads from the bones of the buffalo, and the indians used the sinews of the buffalo as thread, and the Buffalo skull has a place of reverence on the altar at many Sioux ceremonies. 3. Page 61 &quot;This attitude also means a reverence for all other living things in the world. Everything was put on this &quot;island&quot; earth by the Great Spirit. All people and things are relatives.&quot; I am happy to see that Mr. Zeilinger truly does understand Sioux spirituality whether he is capabable of crossing all of the Ts and dotting all the Is or not. I will leave you with a quote I use from time to time. &quot;How can you worship the Great Spirit and not have respect for the Great Spirit's creation?&quot; Please E-Mail if you have questions or comments about this review.

Ms. Kehoe did a good job at tracing the practise of the ghost dance from the time that Wovoka (A Paiute medicine man) was given this ceremony to the masacre by the military at Wounded knee creek South Dakota in 1890 to the second incident at Wounded knee creek in 1973.<br />For people interested in seeing the ghost dance watch the dance in the movie &quot;Billyjack&quot; after Billyjack goes through the ceremony with the rattlesnake. I have heard that Wovoka's son  or son-in-law supervised that scene of the movie.<br />Basicly the people would dance until they would faint from exhaustion, and while unconscious they would see into the spirit world something similar to an OBE.<br />On page 62: Ms. Kehoe states that Nick Black Elk (Sioux holy man) was a practising Catholic. It is true that Black Elk went to mass after he married the second time. However; the prayer that Black Elk offered on Harney peak, and is recorded in the book &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; John G. Neihardt, it is abundantly clear that his spiritual beliefs in Wakan Tanka (Sioux name for the Great Spirit) never wavered. He may have went along with Catholocism for peace in the family, or to stop the proselytizing church members. I used the same tactic early in life.<br />Ms. Kehoe; made one statement on page 65 that made me angry! She implies that Nick Black Elk had partial blindess by using gunpowder in his yuwipi healing ceremony to fool the indians into thinking the spirit helpers had arrived by throwing a pinch of gunpowder in the fire.<br />With my understanding of Sioux spirituality, and the properties of gunpowder. I state categoricaly that this is impossible! 20 years ago; I used gunpowder to reload the cartridges for my high powered rifle.<br />In the Yuwipi ceremony the indians remove all furniture from the room, and place quilts over the doors and windows to block all light from entering the room, and the wicasa pejuta or wicasa wakan (medicine man or holy man) has his hands tied behind his back with rawhide, and then they usualy wrap him up in a star quilt like a mummy and the quilt is tied around his body. The wicasa pejuta or wicasa wakan is placed on the floor, and the lamp is put out leaving the people in total darkness (there is no fire, and the yuwipi man is tied up in a quilt; making it impossible to use gunpowder in this manner).<br />Ms. Kehoe may have meant the Inipi (sweat lodge) ceremony so I will describe that to you. A sweat lodge structure is built of saplings or willow limbs, and a large fire is built to heat rocks until they are red hot. While  the rocks are heating they dig a hole in the center of the structure to hold the rocks, and the removed dirt is used to build a mound to the east of the structure, then the indians cover the ground with sage, and quilts are put over the structure. Water is poured over the rocks making steam inside the structure. (It would be impossible for Nick Black Elk or any wicasa wakan to use gunpowder on the rocks. Everyone is drenched with steam, and is sweating profusely. Gunpowder will not burn or explode if it gets wet. This is the reason for the saying (keep your powder dry.).)<br />I am NOT asking you to take my word for any of this.

This is a wonderful story about a white woman that became a medicine woman (winan pejuta). <br />At the beginning of the book Ms. Eaton was living in a shack, in ill health, and barely surviving. A friend suggested that she go to a medicine man (wicasa pejuta) and ask for a healing at a sweat lodge. As time goes by; attends cerempnies, and as more time passes she goes through fasts, and later obtains a Catlinite (pipestone) pipe and becomes a medicine woman, and used her gift to help the people around her until her death in 1983.<br />Unfortunately; she had MANY problems with some indians because she attended the ceremonies, and was a pipe carrier. It did NOT matter to them that she helped the people, she had undergone three fasts, and the spirits had chosen to work with her.<br />This animosity is STILL going on from some indians to whites, and mixed bloods that are not indian enough (in their opinion) to practise this form of spirituality. I have received some very angry E-Mails from people that claim to be indians, and are offended that I am a pipe carrier, and choose to follow this path. One person went so far as to challenge me with \\"Your people stole our land, and how dare you now steal our religion!\\". <br />I am not stealing anyones religion. I am only following a path that works for me. I know there is real spirituality in this path, and it answers more of the questions I have (It even explained the experiences I had 40+ years ago). I have studied most religions from agnosticiam to zen.<br />Now; I do have a few minor problems with this book.<br />1. There are several misspellings in this book.<br />2. She incorrectly assumes that all medicine people or holy people MUST use a Catlinite (pipestone pipe).<br />The spirit helpers choose to work with the person based on their integrity, and sincerity. In 1999; the Bear Totem animal would NOT be denied. The Bear repeatedly showed up trying to get my attention and let me know that it had decided to work with me. At that time I neither had a pipe, nor used tobacco in any way...	2001-08-21

On page 39; Mr. Wildish states there are 365 accupuncture points on the body. There are 705 accupuncture points.<br />8. On page 54; Mr. Wildish states that accupuncture is painless while inserting the needles. Some of the accupuncture points can be very painful while inserting the needles. After the needle has entered the point and the ch'i flow has been altered, it is painless.<br />9. Page 92Mr. Wildish implies that Sensei Mikao Usui (the founder of Reiki) was a &quot;christian&quot;. There is not one scintila of evidence that Sense Usui was a &quot;christian&quot;, or that he ever traveled to the United States, or that he ever attended a Christian University in Chicago. I am a Reiki master, and have searched for information about Sensei Usui for years.<br />10. Why is does a book titled &quot;The Book Of Ch'i&quot; go into fields as diversed as Chi Kung (Qigong), Zhan Zhaung, Accupuncture, Shiatsu, Do-In, Reiki, Tai Chi Ch'uan, Pa Kua, Hsing I Ch'uan, Budo, Aikido, Iaido, Feng Shui, Meditation, Therapeutic Touch, and Reflexology. This book is ONLY 242 pages in length, and does not cover any of them in enough depth to really assist you.<br />I would recommend yjay you leave this book on the shelf.<br />If you want to begin energy work look for another volume, or E-Mail me for recommendations.

I really dislike writing negative reviews, but sometimes it is necessary to call a spade a spade. Unfortunately this is one of those times. ;-(<br />These sections were disappointing.<br />Page 9: \\"and each meridian has the same amount of energy\\".<br />This is not only wrong, but dangerous. Six of the 12 primary meridians operate on yang (a hot and active) Qi. The other six primary meridians operate on yin (a cool and passive) Qi. If you were to flood the yin meridians with yang Qi you can really mess up your endocrine system. Something I do NOT recommend.<br />Page 24: The UN (Under Nose)vital point shown directly under the nose is in the wrong place. That vital point is on the colon meridian, and is located on the upper left lip.<br />Page 26: The authors say that vital points on the side of hand. back of hand, little Finger, middle finger, index finger, and thumb are the same on both hands. This is NOT so. The lung, pericardium, and heart meridians terminate on the right hand, but the colon, triple heater, and small intestine meridians terminate on the fingers of the left hand. If you stimulate the SH (side of the hand) point on the right hand you will be stimulating the heart meridian, and on the left hand you would be stimulating the small intestine meridian.<br />Nowhere in this book shows an illustration of where the meridians are on the body.<br />This Book speaks of the meridians, but not once discusses the 8 Qi vessels.<br />This book only discusses 17 vital points on the body. This is woefuly imcomplete (2.5%) when you understand there are 705 of these vital points on the human body (I use 63 of them) but then I am not an accupuncture therapist.<br />Please E-Mail me if you have questions or comments about this review. ....<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2001-06-19

But with limitations	I would like to give this book five stars, but with my years of energy work I see two flaws in Dr. Krieger's (Dolores Krieger holds a Ph.D in nursing) book.<br />The things I like about this book.<br />Several places in this book; Dr. Krieger uses the phrase &quot;You do not stop at your skin&quot;. (A statement I agree with completely!)<br />Page 5-10 the introduction explains how Dr. Krieger began her exploration of energetic healing by observing natural healers like Oskar Estebany, and Dora Kunz.<br />Page 11. The Kirlian photos of fingertips showing the energy field around the fingers before, during, and after a healing session (proving there IS something to the notion of energy healing instead of coincidence).<br />Page 12. Dr. Krieger refers to the subtle energy by the sanskrit term &quot;prana&quot;. This subtle energy has been explored by people all over the world, and has been called by dozens of different names. Here is an abbreviated list (Akasha, ch'i (Qi), Ki, Mana, Manitou, Nuwati, Orenda, Orgone, Ruach, and many others.)<br />Page 15. According to Dr. Krieger there is a written history of this subtle energy dating back 5000 years. (I am aware that The Yellow emperor of China wrote his treatise of internal medicine in 2445 BCE (about 4,450 years ago.)<br />Page 23-34. This section of the book contains simple exercizes where about 95-98% of people can feel and experience this subtle energy and proove it to themself (from my experience, and talks with Qigong masters about 2-5% of people are insensitive to this subtle energy). (Everyone needs proof in the beginning in order to gain confidence that this energy is REAL and not only wishful thinking or coincidence.)<br />Page 62-63. Has nice photos of Dr. Krieger's friend and mentor Dora Kunz.<br />Now for the two disagreements I have with this book.<br />1. Dr. Krieger severely limits her potential because Therapeutic touch is taught to direct this energy to the recepient a few inches away. (This subtle energy can be directed thousands of miles away as effectively as if the healer were standing right beside the recepient. I have doccumentation where I have passed Reiki attunements to people over 10,000 miles away with their experiences. Dr. Larry Dossey relates in &quot;Prayer Is Good Medicine&quot; (if memory serves) the results of a double blind study where half of the Heart patients  in a large hospital were prayed for by people of various faiths, and the people that were on the prayer list (without knowing anything about the test) experienced less complications, and required less medication for pain.)<br />2. Dr. Krieger teaches only how to direct the healers personal reserves of energy. (There are mental exercizes as in Qigong, and healing modalities like Reiki, Seichim, and others that can teach you how to tap into an infinite supply of energy without depleting youe personal reserves of energy.) <br />(Repeatedly depleting your personal energy reserves can open you the healer to illnesses. If you ever feel weak or nervous stop immediately.)<br />Please E-mail me if you have questions or comments about this review. Two Bears.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)	2001-06-02

Many people will become VERY angry about this book.<br />Some will become angry because they assume they spent money on trash.<br />Others will become angry because they will begin to understand that they have denied their God given power for years.<br />I wish to give Dr. Mishlove two thumbs up for his masterful research and doccumentation.<br />Ted Owens lived far from a saintly life, and had a fragile ego, and used his power for both positive and negative ends, and he will be held accountable for the way he used or misused this power.<br />Now to Mr. Owens idea that he communicated what he wanted done to Space Intelegences (SIs) Twitter and Tweeter, and they were the ones that carried them out. In my opinion; Tweeter and Twitter did not actualy exist. I believe they were only figments of his imagination in an attempt to seperate him from the responsibility of what he did.<br />Rabbi Yonasson Gershom wrote a terific review below. However; he is in error about one thing. It IS possible for mankind to affect the weather. The American Indian has influenced the weather for Millennia. I say weather modification can be done because I have done it myself.<br />I have doccumentation where I have taught students to direct this force (Akasha, Ch'i, Itaki, Ki, Mana, Manitou, Nuwati, Orgone, Orenda, Ruach and many other names) and punch holes in clouds, affect candle flames, and more. <br />I also have doccumentaion where I have affected the energy field of people from thousands of miles away.<br />The good Rabbi is absolutely correct about evil and negative entities. I also have doccumentation where I have performed house blessings and exorcisms.<br />In &quot;Chi Kung: For Health and Vitality&quot; Sifu Wong doccuments sending ch'i to a person 2000 miles away for healing.<br />In one chapter of this Book Dr. Mishlove doccuments a sudden onset of a severe sore throat immediately following a heated telephone discussion with Ted, then Ted calling Dr. Mishlove two hours later appologizing, and promising never to do that again, and the sore throat left as suddenly as it appeared.<br />This also can be done. In several of the case reports of &quot;Recovering The Ancient Magic&quot;, and &quot;The Secret Science Behind Miracles&quot; Max Freedom Long doccuments some Hawaiian Kahunas using the death prayer and killing people in a matter of days, whether the intended victim was aware of the curse or not. <br />Dr. Alberto Villoldo a deffinate disbeliever at the time doccuments where he tests a Shaman to affect his health negatively from thousands of miles away, and doccuments it in his book &quot;Shaman, Healer, Sage&quot;.<br />I only hope that people will  raise the blinders and become aware of the power given to us by our Creator, and use it for the betterment of mankind. <br />We should use this power to heal mother earth and all of our relations.<br />Please E-Mail me if you have questions or comments about my review.

A Reiki practitioner should never touch the breasts or genitals.<br />Page 79. &quot;Chinese sources speak of 12 major energy channels called meridians and 8 minor ones&quot;<br />Here the author delves into Qigong again, and not only that supplies wrong information. There are twelve primary  meridians, and hundreds of smaller meridians. the Baihui vital point on the crown of the head is a meeting point of 100 or more meridians. I guess &quot;the 8 minor ones&quot; the author is referring to are the 8 Qi vessels. Qi vessels and meridians are not the same thing.<br />The information regarding the chakras on pages 101 and 102 is incorrect. Most notably where the author links the Pineal gland with the 7th chakra. The Pituitary gland should be associated with the 7th chakra because the Pituitary gland releases hormones during your life that regulates all of the other glands in the endocrine system. The pineal should be associated with the 6th chakra (the third eye).<br />It really grates on my nerves when I see someone try to speak with authority when it is patently obvious (to someone that has been there and done that) they do not know what they are talking about.<br />I am a Master/Teacher of three forms of Reiki, a master of Seventh Facet Seichim, and a lifelong student.<br />Please E-mail me if you have comments or questions about this review.

After reading the MANY negative reviews for this book; I decided to update my earlier review and explain a few things to some of the self professed Feng Shui experts that ripped this wonderful book.    1. This book is about the black hat sect of Feng Shui. NOT the Form or compass sects of Feng Shui.    The Form and compass schools of Feng Shui work expertly in Asia where the homes are built facing south to take advantage of the heat of the sun in winter. Homes are designed to better take advantage of Feng Shui from the beginning.    Here in the west when the homes are built where they face every different direction imaginable; so the rigid compass school of Feng Shui does not work here as it does in Asia.    The form sect of Feng Shui DOES work in the U.S. but not many people practise that variety, and is very complex to understand.    2, The Black hat sect of Feng Shui is the easiest sect of Feng Shui that I have EVER read!    3. Ch'i primarily enters the home at the front door. It is only logical to turn the compass in the direction your home is facing, and viola; you end up with the black hat sect!    4. I read lots of books on Feng shui (teaching both the form and compass sects; and in my years of trying; Feng Shui was pointless.    I bought this book quite some time ago, and learned that my prosperity corner was in the bathroom. I starting keeping the commode lid down, and the bathtub and sink closed. amd placed a peice of jade in the linnen closet. since I have been doing this; I have been more prosperous than at any other time since I lived in this apartment. I have sold more than $4,000 of books, got a raise at my job, AND gave three HUNA workshops (One in Atlanta, Ga, and two HUNA workshops in Ontario, Canada), and will probably be going to the Caribbean next year to give a HUNA workshop.    5. I KNOW from first hand experience that this book works, and will help anyone with an open mind.    6. If your house faces south; the compass sect of Feng Shui will work GREAT; but if you are like me, and your residence faces North west, or in some other direction; then BUY this book!    I am NOT entirely happy with the book because it is weak on cures for dealing with shars (poisoin arrows).    E-Mail me if you like.	2001-01-04

This universal lifeforce energy has been around since the beginning of the universe, and people from all over the world have discerened this energy, and have called it by dozens of names over the millenia (Akasha, Ch'i (Qi), Ki, Mana, Nuwati, Orgone, Prana, Ruach are some of the more common names ).

In addition; I have a stack of printed E-Mails of some of my students attunement experiences.<br />Page 71: &quot; The course normally takes two days (or four sessions) amd includes a further energy attunement to intensify your inner healing channel - to as much as four time thar received with first degree&quot;<br />  This is NONSENSE! Science has not been able to prove the existence of Ki energy yet. So science certainly hasn't been able to measure something that isn't supposed to exist. A Level II Reiki practitioner can channel more Ki than they could as a Level I because in Level II they are given techniques to focus and calm the mind and calm the breath they were not given in Level I.<br />Page 76 - 77: &quot;Even if you have little money to spare, and think you couldn't possibly afford to pay some of the larger sums required, I can assure you that if it is right for you to learn from a particular Master the relevant money will come to you somehow.&quot;<br />  This is INEXCUSABLE! Money should NEVER be the determining factor if a person is to learn Reikior not. I pass free attunements (in an attempt to balance the scales for bad things I did early in life). Some of my students have insisted on bartering something in trade for the attunements and knowledge, so I have accepted a pound of coffee, crystals, a personal natal horoscope chart, books, and other similar items. ;-)<br />Page 82: &quot;One of these major effects, therefore is what is called the 21-day clearing cycle&quot;<br />  I don't know why people continue to perpetuate the myth of a 21 day cleansing process. I told some of my students about the cleansing process, and with others I said nothing about a cleansing process. Generaly; the ones I told about a cleansing process experienced one. Generaly the ones I did not tell about a cleansing process did not experience one.

I have so many problems with this book I hardly know where to begin.<br />Back cover &quot;The only book written by a Qigong master and Chinese Physician.&quot; Master Lam Kam Chuen is a Qigong master, and a Chinese doctor, and his initial book &quot;The Way of Energy&quot; was published in 1991 (6 years earlier than this volume.)<br />Repeatedly through this volume Master Hong Liu refers to transmitting external Qigong. He is transmitting external Qi not Qigong. Qi is the energy. Qigong is the system of transmitting it. This is a minor nitpick, but I point it out for clarification.<br />Page xiii of Foreword &quot;There are twelve of these meridians which correspond to twelve organs.&quot; There are 12 primary meridians, 8 Qi vessels, and hundreds of smaller meridians. The Baihui vital point on the crown of the head is the meeting point of 100 or more meridians. There is no organ called &quot;The Triple Heater&quot; but there is a triple heater meridian that ends on the fourth finger of the left hand.<br />Page XVI of foreword. &quot;Almost anyone who wants to devote twenty years to study Qigong as he has can master it.&quot; Horse feathers! I have been practising Qigong for years, and a Master/Teacher of three forms of Reiki, and a Seventh Facet Seichim master. Reiki is the transmission of this same Universal Lifeforce energy. In China is is called Ch'i (QI), and in Japan this energy is called Ki. It does not take 20 years to be able to transmit this energy for healing. I have had some recepients scream (from surprise not pain) at the heat of my hands. Many of the people I pass Reiki attunements can transmit this energy as effectively as I in considerably less time than 20 years!<br />Page XVII &quot;And there is no better person in the United States to provide this information that Dr. Hong Liu.&quot; Any number of people can provide factual information in this vein. Qigong masters L.V. Carnie, and Richard Mooney, James MacRichie an Accupuncture therapist in Colorado (if memory serves), myself or any number of other people.<br />Page 56 &quot;Since notes could serve as proof that a person had studied Qi Gong, they were abolished by the masters of this healing art.&quot; This may be true AFTER the communists came to power. There are scrolls dating back to 2445 BCE with Qigong information. This information was clearly originaly intended to be shared.<br />Page 62 &quot; Do not reveal them to anyone else or you will lose your power.&quot; Then the very next paragraph says &quot;I was to practise these exercizes every available minute of each day. Master Kwan even said that I should do these exercizes during my meal breaks instead of eating.&quot; Am I the only person that sees contradiction in three sentences on the very same page?<br />Page 112 &quot;In Chinese medicine, we believe that prostate cancer is caused by blockage of the Sanjaio, Kidney, an bladder meridians.&quot; I have NEVER heard of the Sanjaio meridian. The Kidney meridian ends on the little toe of the left foot. The Urinary Bladder meridian ends on the little toe of the right foot. The Gall Bladder meridian (because Dr Liu did not specify which bladder meridian) ends on the fourth toe of the left foot.<br />Page 204 and several of the other recipes for decoctions, and tinctures Dr. Hong Liu uses Ma Huang (Ephedra). This is a very powerful and dangerous herb so use with extreme caution!<br />Page 218 &quot;Another simple yet effective exercize is to focus on the yong Quan point, which is on the bottom of the foot in the middle of the arch. This Qi spot is on the left foot for men and the right foot for women&quot; Wrong again, There are two Yong Quan points (on each foot directly behind the ball of the foot). There are similar vital points in the palm of each hand, These vital points are called Lao Gong.<br />If you have read my review this far and want to practise Qigong, I make the following recommendations.<br />Beginners with no Qigong experience.<br />  &quot;Chi Kung: For Health And Vitality&quot; Wong Kiew Kit<br />  &quot;The Way of Energy&quot; Lam Kam Chuen.<br />Advanced.<br />  &quot;Ch'i: The Power Within&quot; Geoff and Phyllis Pike<br />  &quot;Chi Gung&quot; L.V.

During darkness plantlife takes in oxygen and releases carbon  dioxide.<br />b. plantlife is dormant for a large part of the year, and for  bacterium to break down rotting trees, and leaves actualy takes oxygen out  of the air we breathe. <br />2. Global warming: When the NWS set up weather  stations they set up the stations in areas where the the heatsink effect  from the vast areas of concrete and asphalt in cities would not give false  readings on these instruments. Cities have grown, and interstate highways  have been built. and those sensitive instruments are providing false  readings.

There is MUCH I agree with in this book and some I disagree with.<br />Disagreements first.<br />1. On page 94 Mr. McGaa implies that Word Processors updates files on disk incrementaly. Only some word processors do  this.<br />2. On page 149 Mr. McGaa categorizes his wotai (personal stone) as  a portable altar. I disagree because it is only a stone. I have been  carrying a personal stone for years. The Cherokee word is watai.<br />3. On  page 198. Mr. McGaa purports that Democracy was an invenion of the Native  Americans. If memory serves Democracy was first practised in the days of  Aristotle and Plato. Furthermore the U.S. was not set up as a Democracy. It  was set up as a Republic. Now it IS true that the U.S constitution was  loosely based on the Iriquois constitution.<br />4. On page 199, Mr. McGaa  perpetuates the myth of the seperation of church and state in the  Constitution. There is NO comment of &quot;Seperation of church and state  in the constitution. That comment was written by Thomas Jefferson in the  Federalist papers not the Constitution.<br />6. On page 205 Mr. McGaa talks  about abortion and contraception. I vehemently disagree with his philosophy  of abortion, but do agree with his notion of  contraceptives.<br />Agreements:<br />1. On page 6: I appreciate Mr. McGaa's  humility in his comment &quot;I may be wrong. You might be right. I don't  know.&quot;<br />2. On page 30: Mr. McGaa purports  that &quot;A good teacher  welcomes questions.&quot; I could not agree more.<br />3. On page 112: Mr.  McGaa purports that the pipe can be considered as a portable altar and I  agree completely.

(cats that had  kept the rat population in check. were wontonly destroyed because that  might be &quot;witches familiars&quot;).<br />6. On page 207-8 Mr. McGaa  discusses homosexuality. I agree completely that Great Spirit does not make  mistakes and EVERYONE should be treated with dignity regardless od sexual  preference.<br />7.

This could NOT be farther from the truth.<br />1. Israelites had a written language thousands of years ago and they wrote the Torah, Talmud, and other important texts. The Hawaiian people had NO written language until the \\"christian\\" missionaries created the Hawaiian written language.<br />2. The Jewish language is full of consonants and harsh sounding words. The Hawaiian language only has 13 letters, and is more melodious. The Hawaiian language has the five vowels A, E, I, O, U, and the consonants H, K, L, M, N, P, W, and the glottal stop usually marked as an apostrophe (') and pronounced as a short pause (even silence was important in the Hawaiian langguage)<br />3. To the Jews; the Creators most sacred name is YHVH, The Hawaiians name for the Cretor E'O.<br />4. The Jews viewed the Creator as a wrathful jealous Creator that demanded blood sacrifices. The Hawaiians knew of the Creator E'O; but generally worked with their 'Aumakua, the Po'e 'Aumakua, or the Akua. The Hawaiians believed that all spiritual powers above the Akua were beyond human comprehension.<br />Mr. Glover goes on to state that there are aka cords between the Uhane (oohahnee), the Unihipili (ooneehepeele), and 'Aumakua (owmakua), and ALL communication between the Uhane and 'Aumakua MUST go by indirect method through the Unihipili. This is NOT so. Every time you think of a person; you send out an aka cord, and through these aka cords you can send mana (universal lifeforce energy), or thoughts or ideas. So when you begin to work with your 'Aumakua; you send out more and more of these aka cords that complete the triad of selves.<br />Now it is true that prayers have to go through the Unihipili because the kino kanaka (physical body) has to be instructed by the Unihipili to breathe deeply and gather the mana surcharge to aid in manifesting the prayer action...	2000-04-25

Sifu Lam neglects to include an illustration of where the meridians (energy  pathways) occur on the body. &quot;The Way of Energy&quot; also neglects  this information.<br />2. On page 109 Sifu Lam implies that Qigong (chi kung)  exercizes will improve visual acuity. This is true providing that the  visual deteioration is caused by lack of blood flow to the eyes. However  deformity of the lens in problems like astygmatism will not be  helped.<br />After studying the exercize regimen in this book, I noticed that  this book only includes the first five Zhan Zhaung (Jan Jong) poses listed  in the earlier book &quot;The Way of Energy&quot;, and the fact that he has  changed the name for some of the poses.<br />On page 150 Sifu Lam cautions  readers to pay attention to the subtle signals their body sends to them. I  agree with this 100%! <br />Overall: this book is a very good place to start,  but IMHO &quot;The Way of Energy&quot; is the better book.<br />If I may be of  assistance feel free to E-Mail me.<br />William H.

However; Ms, Horan continues to perpetuate two myths about Reiki. 1. The 21  day cleansing process. 2. Dr. Mikao Usui a Christian. The Cleansing process  is different for everyone. My cleansing process lasted for two days, but I  had 25 years of energy work before receiving my attunements. Dr. Mikao Usui  (The man that discovered Reiki in the early 1800s) was a buddhist. Ms.  Horan mentioned two associations of Reiki Masters. &quot;Reiki  Alliance&quot;, and &quot;AIRA (American International Reiki  Association&quot;. I can add two more associations to this list.  &quot;Reiki Touch&quot;, and &quot;GRMA (Global Reiki Masters  Association&quot;. I am a member of the GRMA. Ms. Horan added one nice  touch to this book. Namely the Kirlian protography on page 20 demonstrating  the difference in the Reiki practitioners energy field before and during a  Reiki treatment.

This book has VERY little to do with Reiki (Pronounced as Ray Key). This book lacks the symbols used in Reiki. This book lacks instructions for passing attunements. This book continues to perpetuate two Reiki myths.       a. The 21day cleansing process      b. Mikao Usui (The discoverer of Reiki  was a Christian.) The cleansing process varies in length from individual to  individual. You can reduce the cleansing process after a Reiki attunement   from weeks to days by drinking more water, getting more rest after the  attunement, and giving yourself Reiki treatments. Mikao Usui was searching  for the type of healing practised by Buddha, Christ, Mohammed, and others.  However; from reliable information. I have learned that Dr. Usui was a  buddhist. Last Nitpick: Ms. Horan is a traditionalist Reiki Practitioner,  ie a person should wait three years before receiving the third degree Reiki  attunement. There is a very good reason for waiting 2 months or so between  attunements because it takes time for the body to adjust to the increased  flow of energy, but to wait three years is excessive in my opinion.

A Reiki  practitioner should never touch private areas of the person receiving the  treatment. In fact; with level II or above Reiki practitioners need not  touch the recepient at all. 3.

While it is true that you CAN hurt  yourself. In my opinion the Nei Dan aspect of Chi Kung is nowhere as  dangerous as some of the breathing exercizes.  On page 27 Dr. Yang cautions  readers to perform the hand forms exactly as shown. The Hand forms are the  least important aspect there is to Chi Kung. The mental (Nei Dan) and the  breathing exercizes are far important. Now you should perform the hand  forms as accurately as possible so that you will derive the most benefit  from them. But if your joints, muscles, and tendons will not allow to  perform the form exactly. do not worry about it. Perform the hand forms as  accurately as you can. and give your body time to adjust.  When performing  the Chi Kung exercizes, perform them with a relaxed and cheerful attitude;  or don't do them. The exercize &quot;Draw the bow&quot; On the Cover Dr  Yang demonstrates the arm holding the bow where the wrist is straight  pointing two fingers in the direction the arrow would go. There is a very  easy way to improve this exercize and cause chi (qi) to gather in the arm.  You should bend the wrist back as nearly  90 degrees as comfortably  possible and only extend the index finger. This will stimulate the liver  meridian. Try the exercize both ways and decide for yourself which way is  more effective. Dr. Yang spends quite some cames talking about the  meridians (He uses the term channels&quot;. however; I wish Dr. Yang had  included a drawing to show where the meridians occur. May your chi (qi)  flow wild and free.	1998-10-26

I have read several books dealimg with Zhan Zhaung (pronounced Jan Jong),  and I have recommended some of them, but with a disclaimer &quot;Not safe  for beginners&quot;. &quot;The Way of Energy&quot; IS safe for beginners,  if the authors advice is heeded. Do listen to the signals your body sends  you. This book has a safe and effective exercize system called Ba Duan Jin.  to loosen the joints, muscles and tendons. On first  glance you may assume  that standing in one pose for a few minutes is extremely easy, but don't  let that fool you. Zhan Zhaung is one of the most demanding forms of  exercize ever developed.  In my opinion standing in the second  position  &quot;Holdinng the balloon&quot; for 15 minutes will give you more of a  workout than power walking for 3 miles. It will deffinately build your  endurance!  With dedicated practise it isn't unrealistic to build your  endurance to where you can hold one pose for an hour or more.  I like Zhan  Zhaung because it doesn't abuse the body the way most exercizes do, and I  meditate during my Zhan Zhaung sessions. This way I don't have to make time  for exercize and meditation. I am not entirely happy with this book because  it doesn't have a drawing showing where the meridians occur on the body, or  teach how to lead chi along the meridians to clear blockages. If you think  Zhan Zhaung is too easy, there are several ways to increase the difficulty.  a. increase the difficulty of the pose by widening the stance, bending the  knees more, or holding the arms higher. b. increase the time spent in Zhan  Zhaung c. hold weights.	1998-10-21

I was expecing great things from this 420+ page book. Unfortunately I am VERY disappointed with &quot;The way of Qigong&quot; by Kenneth S. Cohen for two reasons.<br />1. the mental (Nei Dan) aspect of Chi Kung is mentioned only in passing with no useful information.<br />2. There is no illustration, or adequate description of where the meridians appear on the human body.  Meridians are channels under the skin that distributes Ch'i throughout the body; much the same way arteries and veins distribute blood, oxygen, and nourishment to the cells. On pages 255 and 256, Mr. Cohen displays where the meridians end on the hands and feet. Completely inadequate information.<br />-----<br />&quot;The way of Qigong&quot; contains adequate information on the physical (Wai Dan) aspect of Chi Kung. However; without the mental (Nei Dan) aspect of Chi Kung; you will only receive about 1/3 of the true benefit of Chi Kung.<br />&quot;The way of Qigong&quot; contains adequate information on various breathing techniques.<br />&quot;The way of Qigong&quot; contains several methods of meditation.
