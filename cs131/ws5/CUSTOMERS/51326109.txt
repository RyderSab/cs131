KA could have went at least to 30.  <br />Actually, I can kind of see 28 being the end of the series in a way.  Though there were many questions left unanswered, some questions were answered sublminally.  Aisha figured out Felicias game.  Nina, Lucas, and Zoey mended their relationship.  And we discovered that Claire is not an ice princess.  It had the traditional everybody lived happily ever after cliche.<br />I look forward to reading some more of KA's work.	2002-06-06

I have begun to gain respect for Claire as the story continued.  On the flip side of that, Zoey has become more nerve racking with each book.  <br />A foot note to Christopher.  I understand that he was being polite by inviting Felicia to hang out with him and Eesh.  However, you might want to take heed to the unspoken tention that exist between the two of them(espceially from Aisha).  I thought that perhaps Christopher would have learned after the other numerous screw-ups with Eesh, that is obviously not the case.<br />I am glad that Mr. P had the little talk with Zoey about love and forgiveness.

Christopher needs to quit being such a jerk to his sister.  It is not her fault that Aisha was a bit more intelligent than he thought.  Her suspicions would not be aroused, if he had not been so rude and mean to his sister and had just been honest.  He created his own misery and he deserves to be miserable.

Aisha would have had nothing to worry about if she had just been up with Christopher from the beginning.  Once again, Lucas needs to get a hold of himself.  He completely misses the point everytime.  I am quite sure Zoey would have been thrilled that Lucas liked her writing.  However,  He should not have read that story in the first place.  Zoey told him specifically that she would show him her story some other time.  Just like in the beginning when Zoey would have keep telling him no about sex, she kept telling him no about invading her privacy.  Lucas is hard headed.  I have absolutely nothing to say about Lara, Claire, and Aaron.  It is one thing to be angry at Aaron, and for whatever reason not like Sarah.  But, she had absolutely no consideration on how this would emotionally drain her father.  The same father that tried to do whatever he could to keep her driving secret buried.  As for Aaron, he is bad news all the way around.  Benjamin is kind of redeeming himself by searching for Nina.	2002-04-28

I have not really been crazy about Claire from the beginning; however, I really don't like her now.  She has no right to ruin her fathers life, because someone else complicated hers.  She needs to take it out on Aaron not her father and Sarah.  <br />I really hope to see Jake and Kate hook up.  I really am starting to like Jake.  As for Lara, I have absolutely nothing to say about Lara.  She doesn't deserve any pity.  She has no common respect for other people.

Zoey get a grip.  I don't even know where to begin with Benjamin, except for pathetic.  I understand him being disappointed about the surgery; Hoever, he has no right to shut out Nina.

However, he allowed Nina to come with him during the test and he even slept with her.  So why doesn't he quit being selfish and let his woman be by his side and quit acting like it is pity.  I like Ben; but, he is messing up.  As for Zoey, well history does repeat itself.  These were similar circumstances that lead to her and Jake breaking up.  Aaron is a bit manipulative, but that is what Lucas gets for pushing the sex issue with Zoey.  If he would have been intelligent enough to back off the other 100 times Zoey said no, this situation would no exist.  <br />I understand that he loves Zoey, in fact I get that.  But, no is no, and when she told that she wasn't ready for that he should have left well enough alone.	2002-02-17

I understand her confusion at seeing her parents together after all that confusion errupted on book 6.  However, she is naive to think that she could just forgive and not deal with the issues.  <br />I am not just talking about Lucas and Claire making out.  I am referring to feeling so pressured to have sex.  In her mind she may have just figured that it was a guy thing and that is how boys are.  She has truly found someone that is her equal.  I give two thumbs up for Aaron and Zoey. <br />Quietly I give two thumbs up for Jake and Lara.  I think they can best understand each other and no one else can.  I like how Jake denied that beer, even thought he was craving it.  That took real courage.<br />Claire deserves to be by herself.  The thing about Claire is that she knows that she doesn't have to be manipulative and underhanded to get what she wants, she just chooses to.  Which in itself is bad, because the only thing she will have to look forward to is alone in antartica.	2002-02-08

The storyline would have really been great if she did not remember anything.  Ben and Nina are my favorite couple and I just loved what they went through.  The situation with Jake, I thought was touching and awsome.  I can't entirely blame Claire for her reaction, but yet I really felt where sean was coming from.  Whether Claire likes it or not looks does matter.  But, Sean could have been honest about who he was.  The best way for someone to accept you for who you are, is to know the real you flaws and all.	2002-02-06

After reading this book, I can honestly say that it was all true.  I really liked how time and time again Bilbo proved his value to the journey, especailly when the dwarves began to question his worth.

It was interesting how Troy and Nate were similar; except, Troy new how to save money and Nate didn't.  I felt sorry for the Phalen heirs, because they were doomed from birth.  I even had some sympathy for Troy; simply for the fact, with all his wealth he was still lonely and angry.	2001-05-12

I have decided to read some of Pat's earlier works starting with the Body Farm.  <br />The Body Farm was very interesting and fun read. I realize that Kay has a disfuncitional family.  Kay's mother is selfish and not very nuturing, and those characteristics have transfered to Dorothy.  Dorothy wants the same affection that Kay gets from Lucy; but, she does absolutely nothing to deserve it.  I understand that Lucy being a lesbian is an issue between her and her family.  However, I feel as though is referred to a bit much.	2001-01-01

And now that I have finished this one,  I understand the complex personalities.  I now realize that all of these characters relied on Benton to reaffirm their position in life.  Kay has a really bad issue with trust.  Her sister is not a very nuturing parent or sister.  Dorothy is completely jealous of Kay.  Lucy is stuck in her circumstances and is very needy.  Marino is still in love with his wife and Kay.  He knows well that Kay will never feel the same way, so he completely smitten with jealousy.  The one thing that all these characters have in common,  they are all afraid to deal with themselves.  Benton was their safety net.  I really like the odd twist of this book.  I must admit my disappointment with Diane Bray's death.  I think Kay really needs somebody to go toe to toe with.  Diane and Kay would have been a nice rivarly.	2000-12-27

I agree with the reader who stated that the Kay novels should end at this point.  Point got a little more personal than Unatural did.  There are definetly more issues to deal with personally.  I agree with the fact that Pat did not embelish on the foal or the actual point of origin.  I am inspired to read the previous Kay novels, to really get a feel for Unatural and Point.	2000-11-21
