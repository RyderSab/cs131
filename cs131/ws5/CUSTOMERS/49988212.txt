How did I managed to give this book five stars when it is the series' installment I most complained about?  There are aspects so brilliant they make up for any flaw I might find--the second reading allowed me to see the reason behind these so-called flaws.  The book is startling as an almost 180 degree flip from the cute, wonderlandish feel of the prior books, something I originally found disturbing.<br />And yet the disturbing quality is good.  It's necessary as J. K. Rowling explores the world outside a child's fantasy.  Some may complain, but Harry is growing up--I found his whiney attitude considerably mild in comparison with the many angst-ridden teens I've seen.  Considering all that Harry has been through, I'd be more disturbed had he acted naturally.  And let's remember that many teenagers do read these books--they need someone to connect with.<br />And connect teenagers should.  The dark world that is this book is the twisted mutations of many things familiar to a teenager.  The ultimate sinister teacher is embodied in Umbridge who, if examined, is morbidly evil in an even soulless way.  Even tests are hyperbolized fantastically.  Wild, enchanting, and over-the-top: I like it.<br />I feel J. K. has even improved in her writing.  Tight, quick, description paints an incredible world beyond the now-familiar Hogwarts.  It's a pivot:  the once-strange school has become safe to readers, so Rowling takes them beyond it into the wide wizarding world.<br />This is an excellent fantasy, dark and rich and wonderful.	2003-12-27

What a lovely collection of fairy tales!  People have their favorites from among the French tales; they're familiar and classic, but too often watered down.  It's delightful to see a collection of some original &quot;parlor&quot; stories in their beautiful prose, an amazing form of literature that I feel is rather ignored.  The introduction gives depth and history to the stories as well.	2003-12-27

It really was one of Disney's most beautiful films.<br />That's why I enjoyed this book so much.  It gives an in-depth look at the art, the style, the making, etc.  Each character is discussed with their background.  Best of all, there are amazing pictures--sketch, rough-draft, final--that are absolutely georgous.<br />This book is a great look into the movie.

A very long time.  That is why this book is such a treasure.  Not only does Mr. Alexander give us an entertaining story with lovable, quirky characters, but it works in the tradition of a true fable as it tells of true lessons in life.  I know this is but a review, but I'd like to take the opportunity to point out one particular lesson I found:  Take notice of Jen's gifts.  When first selected, everyone was less than impressed and thought them nothing but junk.  But as various people experienced in the lines of the various gifts meet them (i.e. Voyaging Moon and the flute), they truly appreciate the gifts as practically priceless.<br />So, yes, ignore my annoying observation, and please consider my recommendation of this book.  You will not be disappointed.	2001-07-05

For some odd reason, this has to be one of my favorite editions of Andrew Lang's collection. I'm not sure why.

Sure, all Animorph readers have no doubt wondered about what would have happened if that group of teenagers had just kept walking that fateful night.  That is exactly what we get to see in this book... sort of.  Jake, depressed after an iffy battle, is given the oppurtunity to go back in time, walk past the construction site, and live life normally.<br />The resulting story is nonetheless somewhat entertaining; indeed, a new perspective is shown.  But I still found it trite, inconsistent, and just flat-out boring.  We get some plot/character twists and a couple of minor chase scenes... and nothing else.<br />Yes, it was interesting to see a what if?  But now let's get back to reality.	2001-05-26

Originally, I'm not really sure why I purchased this book... I didn't exactly have my heart set on reading this book, but it was cheap and didn't look bad.  When the book arrived, it turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise.<br />Unlike other mermaid collections I've read, this one is actually addressed to the little girls who are interested in mermaids, but not so simple as to turn off collecters and scholars.  Before each tale is a small summary of information about merfolk in various cultures to set the background for the tale.  Nothing extraordinary, but it's kind of nice to get some mermaid trivia.  Best of all, the author makes an attempt to get stories from a wide variety of places; there is a story from Switzerland as well as Japan!<br />I strongly recommend this collection, for it can be enjoyed by anyone.	2001-03-21

It is exciting, funny, scary, romantic--everything you need for  a good read.<br />The story is about a teenage boy named Eddie Fanta who is  going through some troubles. He can't get over his grandfather's death or  his parents' divorce, he's unpopular, he couldn't get a girl if his life  depended on it. Most of all, he's doubting God. But then he meets Louis, a  crippled recluse who also happens to be an inventor. Eddie gets his hands  on some spectacular inventions, and his life is completely changed.<br />While  extremely entertaining, &quot;Eddie Fantastic&quot; makes you think. God is  easily recognized as the Master Scientist, but what can copying His  inventions bring about? I am strongly reminded of the scriptures  &quot;precept upon precept, line upon line.&quot; We could be given the  most wonderful gifts imaginable... but are we ready for them?<br />Exciting  and thought-provoking, this book lives up to its name: Fantastic.	2000-08-20

I'd tell my friends about this book I've seen, and we'd all giggle, unsure of what it  actually was about.  Seriously, I thought it was just some lady bashing  fairy tales and digging up all the dirt on them.<br />Well, it's certainly the  latter, but nothing was bashed.  Tatar obviously has done a lot of research  in creating this book.  Many venerable references were used.  Tatar dives  into the world of fairy tales; their history, their content, the truth  behind them.  It is fascinating.  I've been aware of some X-rated material  behind Disney's works, but my eyes were still opened at the horrors hidden.  Now I KNOW why all the *step*-mothers were jealous of the beautiful  daughters.<br />A delightful addition were the several tales and prefaces at  the back of the book.<br />&quot;The Hard Facts of Grimm's Fairy Tales&quot;  is an fascinating, educational book for any student or lover of fairy  tales.  My one qualm is how Tatar seemed to be doing some name-calling and  finger-pointing in several incidents.  An unbiased approach would have been  better.	2000-08-02

She makes an easy transition between the usual kid books and something more appreciated  by an adult.<br />&quot;Briar Rose&quot; is the story of Becca, a young  journalist whose grandmother passes away.  Gemma, the grandmother, had  always had a bit of an obsession with the story of Sleepin Beauty, and  would entertain Becca and her sisters with it as they grew up.  But as  Becca matures, she realizes that Gemma seriously thinks the story is about  her.  The strange thing is that no one in Becca's family knows about  Gemma's past.  So, armed with a few photos and Gemma's story, Becca sets  out for Europe, where she unravels a story about the Holocaust and the  truth about her grandmother.  It seems like a good idea, but it comes off  as rather weak.<br />The novel is not, as it seems, a fairy tale in the sense  of fantasy.  Yet Yolen tries to pass it off as a realistic fairy tale,  which is kind of weird and corny.  She also presses in a bunch of  *politically correct* stuff that, good in its own mean, just doesn't fit  well.  The story line runs too much in a straight line, with alternating  chapters rushing back in time to Gemma's story telling days.  Though fairly  interesting, some of the story tends to drag.  Still, Yolen's heart was in  the right place, and the Sleeping Beauty symbolism of the Holocaust was  rather brilliant.<br />All in all, &quot;Briar Rose&quot; is good light  reading, something you can sit down for an afternoon, enjoy, and maybe get  an education out of.	2000-07-17

The story is of that of Emily and Austin.  Austin is the best friend of Emily's brother, and her  lifelong crush.  Austin leaves on his mission, burdened by his parents'  high expectations.  Emily goes off to college to become a tv anchorwoman,  but suffers a tragic accident.  Both characters are delightful and  realistic, people you could get to know.  The book is, at times, serious  and spiritual, but as always, the author makes us all laugh with the humor  he throws in.  &quot;Emily&quot; is a wonderful lesson about what a servant  in Christ really is.  So read it!	2000-07-15

However, it is quite different.  Then again, different is good.<br />In the book summary on the  inside cover, &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; was described as  &quot;pivotal.&quot;  I can think of no better word to describe it.  As the  middle point of the book series, it is definitly a turning point, with  plenty of changes.  Still retaining the original magic that enchanted so  many, this book contains more adult humor, utter terror, a bit of romance,  and the most utter heart-wrenchings than I've seen in the other books.  It  is absolutely brilliant.<br />Harry is now 14, and certainly acts like it.  He  and Ron have discovered girls, which leads to some pretty hilarious scenes.   There is also a dream come true: a trip to a professional Quidditch  Tournament.  And at Hogwarts, a special event has been set up for the  school year involving two other schools: a tournament (to bridge  relationships and understanding between wizards, ect.)  And, most  importantly, there are rumors that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named shall rise  again...<br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is a must-read!   It is full of the excitement and adventure we've come to appreciate.   Still, Rowling is aging her books along with Harry, so this one may not be  as suitable for little children as the original.  There is a particularly  scary chapter. Unlike the predesscors, this book ends on a more fearful  note.  A more serious note is taken on, and the end is powerful, beautiful,  well-written, but a sad tear-jerker.  And Harry IS growing up.  But  overall, the book is excellent!	2000-07-11

It still grasps the horror of the  concentration camps, but it is a fantasy, watered down a bit and told  through the eyes of a child.<br />This is the story of Hannah, a 13-year old  girl who is somehow transported back in time into the body of Chaya, an  orphan living with her aunt and uncle in a 1940's Polish village.  All goes  well until Nazis come, dragging the entire village off to a camp.  There,  Hannah meets Rivka, a strong young girl who is stuck in some sort of Limbo  between accepting her station in life and never giving up hope.  Hannah/Chaya becomes stronger, and gains a better appreciation of her  family's past.<br />The story is absolutely terrifying, but overall is a  beautiful story of hope and overcoming obsticles.  I am very impressed with  Yolen's characterization of Hannah/Chaya and her use of symbolism.  This is  no where near as terrifying as other novels of the camps can get, but that  is because it is for children, and would probably terrify them anyway.  Still, any adult or teenager could sit down and pour through this.	2000-07-02

Maybe that is because  she joined up with Tchen.  They work quite well together.  I hope they'll  do another novel together.<br />&quot;Spinners&quot; is a finely crafted  retelling of the fairy tale Rumplestiltskin.  As usual, the story is told  from a surprisingly different point of view.  The story begins with a happy  young tailor. He is passionatly in love and has his whole life ahead of  him.  Determined to win his bride, he does something rather stupid,  eventually loosing everything.  This is when the familiar story starts up.  The novel is delightful, charming, and spooky.  The characters are  absolutely endearing, in their own, unique ways.  Like earlier reviewers, I  wasn't too pleased with the ending.  In itself, it was a fine ending;  But  the rest of the novel is just too emotional, and the ending just doesn't  fit in well.  I was hoping for something much more... I don't know, warmer.  But the rest of &quot;Spinners&quot; is fantastic.  The writers do tend to  get a bit carried away with the descriptions of spinning (I think I might  go teach a class on it now) but it fits in somewhat.<br />Napoli manages to  keep her signiture spookiness, but I felt this was a much more warmer book,  and I  really enjoyed it.  As always, this isn't a children's book, but I  think someone a year or two younger than Napoli's usual target audience  could stand this.	2000-07-01

When I first looked at &quot;Dragon's Blood&quot;, I wasn't so sure it would be a good book.  I'm a fan of Jane Yolen, but, well, it just didn't look interesting.<br />I was wrong.<br />&quot;Dragon's Blood&quot; is an  amazing work of fiction.  Though I was, at first, strongly reminded of Anne  McCaffrey's Pern, the society described in this book took on it's own  identity.  Yolen creates an amazing planet and culture that arises in the  future.  While the people do have technology, it is not spectacular.  Instead, we are introduced to a charming, though struggling, society built  by criminals, a world based on an economy where dragons are raises to fight  one another.<br />The story revolves around Jakkin, a teenage boy, who is,  unfortunalty, a bonder (basically a paid slave)  He was born free, and his  dream is to pay off his bondage and return to freedom.  To do this, he  steals a  dragon hatchling.  he plans to raise this dragon into a pit  fighter, and thus earn his freedom.<br />I was impressed with Yolen's vivid  desciption and emotion.  The story kept an enjoyable balance between  light-hearted entertainment and deep meaning.  The characters were strongly  devoloped and realistic, adding more to the tapestry of the novel.<br />Like  many readers have said, this book may not be suitable for children, for  there are subtle references to prostitution.  Some may find this shocking,  but it fits well with the book's society.  Besides, the references are  subtle, so a younger, naive child would probably read past these references  without a second thought.<br />Overall, &quot;Dragon's Blood&quot; is a rich,  vivid, imaginative novel, and a worthy tribute to Jane Yolen.  I am looking  forward to reading the book's two sequels.<br />P.S.  My review title is a  delightful little cussword used in the book.  I'll probably be using it  often.	2000-06-27

In this volume, he strays from the more commonly known tales, and instead publishes a collection of exotic tales from Muslim/Hindu countries.  I've  never heard many of the PLOTS before, and we all know that many fairy tales  share common plots.  These tales are surprisingly different, and  delightfully enjoyable.  Anyone who is tired of the traditional Europeon  tales that, while still fantastic, are just too well known, this book is a  wonderful addition to anyone who enjoys folklore.  The pictures are  amazing, too.	2000-06-26

It has a deep, intriguing story line, undeparted from the original plot, polished with simple, yet powerful, prose. I am quite certain that everyone  is familiar with the story of Hansel, Gretal, and their visit to the candy  cottage.  In this amazing retelling, we are priviledged to see the tale  from the *witch*'s side, and the torment she suffered through.  It is  extremely phsycological, yet is not overbearing.  The Ugly One, otherwise  known as the Witch, is a kind, God-fearing midwife in a small village in  medieval Europe.  Through her innocence and good heart, she is slowly,  unwillingly, lead down a dark path, where she is finally under the power of  demons.  Yet through it all, her good heart manages to keep her out of  trouble.  She hides from human contact, fearing the demon presence would  become too powerful.  That is, until two children become lost in her woods.  This is a finely crafted novel about a poor soul who is tortured, and I  shall never be able to look at &quot;Hansel and Gretal&quot; the same way  ever again.  It is beautiful, delightfully creepy, and sprinkled with  symbolism. Napoli, as stated at the beginning of the book, researched  medieval European culture, spirituality, and superstition before writing  this book.  While I really wouldn't recommend this for children, it is  deeply satisfying for anyone else.	2000-06-21

These are the lesser known tales and fables that are certainly  worth a read.  They're fantastic!  The drawings are beautiful, too.

This book was recommended to me by a devote Christian/romance novel addict friend.  I really don't like romance novels.  But, oh, this is a  wonderful book.  Rivers, while delving into some romantic stuff, provides  description, but not so much that you want to puke.  Over all, this is a  beautiful book about forgiveness, finding oneself, and the wrongs of  judging others.  I think Rivers was so scared of being corny that she  didn't dare try to put in a lot of emotion, but there is still a fair  amount of emotion.  The story revolves around Angel, a prostitute who has  taught herself not to feel, having been used by men all her life.  Then she  meets Michael Hosea, who insists she marries him.  She soon finds herself  warming up and falling in love with Michael, but the low opinion she has  for herself keeps getting in the way.  The message happens to be more  powerful than the actual story, though at times the plot is very absorbing,  especially at a particular climax near the end.  This is an amazing  retelling of the Book of Hosea, and I've learned to never judge anyone.  Tacky and unpolished at parts, poetic at others, &quot;Redeeming Love&quot;  is worth a read, even if you don't like romances.	2000-06-06

Still, she always gets them original, and doesn't dish  off a whole bunch of cloned books.  That's why I love her.  Again, we're  not disappointed. In &quot;Before I Say Goodbye&quot; wannabe congresswoman  Nell goes through the loss of her husband when the boat he was on with  several associates suddenly explodes.  The thing is, Adam (her husband) may  have been involved with an architectural scandel, leaving way for anyone to  have a motive to kill him.  To learn more, Nell seeks the aid of psycics.  To my surprise, the book did not totally dive into the psycic thing, only  putting it a healthy dose that we could all deal with.  The story is very  exciting, especially with the two side stories that eventually weave their  way into the main plot.  The story is not exceptionally good, but is still  quite excellent, and Mary definitly gets points for originality, even  though it does follow the same rules.  But again, that's why I love her  books.  So if you're a Clark fan, read this!	2000-06-05

You don't see many works like &quot;Harry Potter&quot; anymore.  It's so refreshing to see the fairy-tale books popping back up for kids again.  She creates an impossible little world of magick which is both funny, sad,  scary, and altogether charming.  These books were not to be aimed only at  children.  It creates a lot of humor and plots the adults and teenagers  would enjoy.  While entertaining, it had its serious side.  I cried at one  part.  I  was thinking it was a children's book, but there are some pretty  freaky things in there! It reminds me of the old fairy tales, and is thus  wonderful.

Okay, I read all the customer reviews about &quot;Rose Daughter.&quot; As a lot of them were pretty negative with a  lot of stuff to back it up, I prepared to read the book with my most discerning mindset.  McKinely had done  &quot;Beauty&quot; and I was sure that  was all she could get out of the Beauty and the Beast story. I was  surprised.  &quot;Rose Daughter&quot; is absolutely  beautiful. The story is done in a fantasy style, with rich, vivid  descriptions and  word usage. It is so hard to find writing  like that anymore. It makes a novel so much more artsy and  absorbing. The book has a darker side, and is almost a mystery, in a  certain sense. There are spells,  sorcerers, simularcums,  stuff that &quot;Beauty&quot; didn't have. Don't get me wrong,  &quot;Beauty&quot; is fantastic, and not  worse than  &quot;Rose Daughter.&quot; But the two books have so many differences that  they just can't be compared.  The ending, to say the least,  wasn't quite what I expected, but nonetheless, I enjoyed it. =D I probably  wouldn't have done what Beauty did, but then again, I have a  twisted sense of morals. Hehe. Anyway, I  don't see why so  many didn't like it. &quot;Rose Daughter&quot; is one word: Beautiful A	2000-04-16

I am planning to collect all of Andrew Lang's color fairy tale books.  It has an excellent group of stories from different fairy tale writers, including Perrault, d'Aulnoy,  and Grimm.  This book was originally printed in the 19th century.  It has  not been abridged, nor have any of the original pictures been taken out.  (Be warned, they're *artistic*)  These are the original, unaltered by  Disney versions, and contain the nightmarish plots they were meant to have.  Anyone who collects fairy tales should have this.	2000-04-16

Okay, I read all the customer reviews about &quot;Rose Daughter.&quot;  As a lot of them were pretty negative with a lot of stuff to back it up, I prepared to read the book with my most discerning mindset.  McKinely had  done &quot;Beauty&quot; and I was sure that was all she could get out of  the Beauty and the Beast story.  I was surprised.   &quot;Rose  Daughter&quot; is absolutely beautiful.

All right, as a former Animorphs reader, I was as excited asany one for Applegate's new series.  I read the first three, and,while enjoying them, was slightly disappointed.  But I continued, realizing it takes awhile to get the series running.  And that's what it looks like it is now doing!  Applegate has got her characters' personalities up and running.  I was surprised.  In the preceding three books, the characters were rather dull.  Then along comes Jalil, and the book gets really psychological.  The story itself was fascinating.  It is easy to tell that Applegate really poured a lot into this book.  The gang have wound up in a city dedicated to the underworld goddess Hel.  Of course, they get involved with her...	2000-04-07

I found this oneperfect.  Brooks, while still following the screenplay, takes thestory into his own hands.  He includes several scenes of his own that aren't in the movie.  These scenes create more motives for the characters.  The book is also useful, as it helps to figure out the names of everyone.  Admit it, it can be hard to do that must by watching the movie.  I now understand the movie better, and I enjoyed learning by the way of Terry Brooks' beautiful prose.  Non-Jedis probably won't enjoy it, but for this is a great book to add to the collection of any Star Wars fan.	2000-03-30

The fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm date back to centuries ago, but only in the 19th century were they written down and collected.  An avid fan of fairy tales, I consider this an important treasure.  These are the  original, untouched-by-Disney, pure tales.  All 250, incluidng 40 never  before seen, are in this.  Many are actually redos of the same tale, but  always with a different twist.  They are full of gore and violence and  everything else, but I've been reading them since I was little.  The author  Jack Zipes also provides plenty of history notes on the collecting,  writing, and translating of the tales and the lives of the Brothers Grimm.  All in all, 'tis excellent collection!	2000-03-29
US	49988212	R39EYCNXLLBW19	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A Beautiful Work of Mythology	Frank Herbert's DUNE presents a society and universe created entirely by the author.  The story was very complex, and written wonderfully with just the right amount of discription.  Herbert made up his own religions and forms of politics which are absolutely enchanting.  One of the story's  components was the classic &quot;coming of age&quot; tale.  Paul, heir to a  Dukedom, moves to the world Arrakis, aka Dune, where his father has taken  control.  However, a rival family isn't too happy about the situation.  Thus unfolds a tale of conspiricy and wonder, and Paul is suddenly revealed  as a legendary man foretold.  I especially enjoyed the psychological  accounts of Paul's metamorphis.  However, I really didn't like the person  he became, but I prefer this change.  The book was a tad more political  than sci-fi, and the story becomes rather entangled in itself.  I was very  impressed by the complete world Herbert created, but I found myself not as  absorbed as I perhaps should be.  The ending, the last couple pages, were  rather disappointing, compared with other highlighs of the novel.  There  are many thought-provoking one-liners and symbolism in the book. However, I  am still not absolutely enthralled with it.  Still, I recommend this to any  who enjoy fantasy worlds.	2000-03-20

In fact, it inspired me to my current way of writing. The weird thing is that the first time I saw this book, I really did not want to read it.<br /><br />But a book that originally began as Ms. Levine's writing class project has proved to be something truly wonderful in a world of far too many Cinderella retalings.<br /><br />The idea here is that the reason Ella (our Cinderella) obeyed her evil stepfamily is because, well, she had to, due to a curse that made her literally obedient to everything command given her.<br /><br />Despite this, she is a spunky heroine that you cannot help but love and does her best to make the best of her world, with the help of a fussy fairy godmother and the friendship of a handsome prince.<br /><br />I like the movie allright, but it is so different from the book that is cannot properly do this justice. It seems all sweet and fluffy, but each time I read it I am blown away by its emotional power.<br /><br />Cute and girly, but still worth its Newberry Honor.	2000-03-01

Such orders have I missed since passing on to highschool.  Eager for a chance to reminisce, I pear over the paper. Such delightful looking  titles, so many choices.  my eye catches something.  COuld it be? The  sequel to the famous novel?  I find a pen.  Several weeks later, sis skips  home from school, lugging an armload of books that I ordered.  Included in  their midst is the Gyspy Game.  I read it.  I burst into tears at the utter  horror of stupidity and lack of point.  All the magic of the Egypt Game has  disappeared, leaving us with an utterly disappointing novel that concludes  with a cheesy, Barney-and-Friends, lets-be-nice-to-society plan in the  making.  Curse the day I wasted money on such filth!  Curse whoever limits  us to a minimum of one star, instead of freeing us to the negativity beyond  zero!	2000-03-01

The story is told through the eyes of the prince, the young man lost by the coast to be bewitched by the strange foundling girl. It leads into a passionate, but wonderfully vague, romance that never quite reveals the true mystery of what Undine is and where she comes from. The ending was absolutely marvelous. The writing is spectacular and this is a fine example of a fairy tale.	2000-03-01
