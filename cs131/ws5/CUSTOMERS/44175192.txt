I intend to read it again with pad and paper at hand.  It has had a noticeable effect on my personal prayer life as well as my outlook on the Christian life, churches and accomplishing the Great Commission.  I first noticed the positive effect that it was having on me when someone found it necessary to wake me up in the middle of the night to ask me to pray.<br /><br />Although it is identified as a Beginner's Guide, it seems very comprehensive as far as the extent that it discusses Biblical doctrines with respect to prayer and intercession.  It provides a good foundation for prayer.<br /><br />First and foremost, the author makes it clear that the absolute foundation of intercession is a relationship with God.  The intercessor should make that the absolute priority for without that you might as well not even go on to Chapter 2.<br /><br />Other topics discussed are perseverance, group intercession, faith, intercession for non-believers, and the ever asked question, \\"Why?\\"  Why is prayer necessary given that God knows what we are going to ask even before we ask it?<br /><br />Also, it should be said that the principles outlined in this book are totally Biblical.  The author can perhaps be described as leaning towards the Charismatic/Pentecostal persuasion in Christianity, but this book does not fixate on that persuasion.  It is not extra-biblical, and the principles taught in this book can be understood and applied by people who are of the Charismatic/Pentecostal persuasion and by those who are not.  It's a very Biblically sound book.<br /><br />One topic that is disappointingly not discussed is the act of \\"abiding\\".  \\"If you abide in me and my words abide in you...\\"  What does it mean to \\"abide\\" in Him?  I think a chapter should have been devoted to that.  But even with that absent, the book is tremendous, and applying the Biblical principles in this book has had a startling effect on my prayer life.effect on my prayer life.	2005-09-16

The youngest was 18, the oldest in his early 20s.  Full of faith, they left their moms, dads, homes, security and everything they knew.  Their destination was certain danger and misery, possible torture and death.  Most never returned.<br /><br />Little visible progress, illness, obstacles, death of friends, co-workers and their own children, illness, antagonists, indifference, illness, financial concerns, war, illness, discomfort, loneliness, depression, persecution and cultural and language barriers plagued them.  The first few years seemed to yield no progress.  The missionaries were discouraged.  They contemplated giving up.  Some actually did leave.  Then things got worse.<br /><br />But the Judsons and others were so convinced of their faith and so confident that their obedience to God's will would produce fruit that they never gave up.  And eventually their work yielded fruit.  First, one convert.  Then a couple other converts and a lot of people who were seriously interested started showing up at their door.  On some occasions people literally begged to hear about Jesus and for copies of the gospel tract that Adoniram Judson had printed in the Burmese language.  The rest is history.<br /><br />It's an inspirational book, and one can appreciate the work of God throughout the book from Judson's infancy to the Karen people who eagerly accepted the gospel.<br /><br />In addition to Adoniram, the respective characters of his wives were discussed in depth.  One can't help but admire with amazement the determination, courage, godliness and fervency of all of these women.<br /><br />This book is impeccably researched.  Names, dates, events and details are abundant throughout the book's 500+ pages.  The author has done extensive research.  The author has also left a comprehensive bibliography and laments that some of Judson's letters home were destroyed (at his request) after the death of his first wife.	2005-09-12

The Reina-Valera version is so complicated, and a big thick impersonal book is intimidating and uninviting for a vibrant young girl.<br /><br />This True Images Bible is very attractive and inviting for young girls, and I am certain that my young friends will enjoy reading this.<br /><br />The book is peppered with focus stories, commentaries and other effects that facilitate the reader to contemplate how the related Bible passages relate to them and their lives.  These commentaries deal with subjects like God's love, prayer, immigration, loneliness, family, drugs, various topics related to sex and dating as well as other topics of interest to young people.<br /><br />The sex and dating subjects may cause a parent to have reservations about giving this to their daughter, but they shouldn't.  These issues, truth be told, will one day have to be addressed by every young person, and the manner in which these issues are addressed in this book are not inappropriate but addressed in a caring yet direct manner.  They could also be used by the concerned parent to facilitate a discussion on these touchy issues.<br /><br />The book also has a subject index and other useful and interesting features including an explanation of the gospel and an invitation to receive Jesus Christ as personal Savior.	2005-08-01

We know the stories about the lives of the pharoahs but not of common laborers.  Until now.  This book documents the life, not of a chief, but of an ordinary Native American woman.  We see how she lives, how she feels, how she thinks, and she is open in expressing her opinions on political issues as well as cultural and social issues.<br /><br />In addition to telling the accounts of her life, the author Mary Brave Bird opens up to allow the reader to see deep into her heart and innermost thoughts.  She is very candid not only about her thoughts and feelings but about her actions as well.  She does not try to hide her faults and describes her own infidelity and irresponsibility without excuses.<br /><br />While reading the book, one is tempted to judge her.  But don't.  She must be applauded for being so open and honest.<br /><br />At one point, she assigns blame to the white man for all the ailments of Indian society.  Yet remarkably she knows that more handouts from the government or more government programs will not be the answer.  The Indians themselves are the only ones who can lift themselves out of poverty, and she is honest in that her own decisions and her own behavior has prevented her and her children from living better lives.	2005-07-22

It's not a discipleship book or doctrinal review.  The author has written other more indepth books on this subject, and in More Than A Carpenter he attempts to present this in a brief, easy to read book.  His primary audience seems to be students, both Christian students, persons contemplating Christianity and even skeptics.<br /><br />In my opinion, the book accomplishes what it set out to do.  Josh McDowell has been involved in ministry to students for decades and has learned to communicate on their level in a manner that they can easily understand.  This book deserves its place as a Christian classic.<br /><br />But I do not wish to limit my recommendation of this book to young people only.  Christian adults will certainly gain a lot from reading this book.	2005-07-14

The author conducted what must have been hundreds of interviews with friends, acquaintances and family.  He consulted as many newspaper and magazine articles and no doubt walked the streets of Austin and Oak Cliff.  The result is a detailed description of his subject and the environment.  Yet it's not a forest for the trees situation.  The details do not drown out the overall story.  Sometimes excessive details can make a book boring or hard to follow.  Not in this case.<br /><br />The author begins the story with the Vaughan's migration to Texas from Kentucky.  He also describes the evolution of Dallas as a music town starting as early as Blind Lemon Jefferson.  Stevie's years as a school boy in Dallas, his years playing small clubs in Austin, and his nonpublic life are described in as much detail perhaps more indepthly than his life as a famous blues superstar.<br /><br />SRV lived his entire life the same way he played guitar: pedal to the metal.  Drugs, girls, partying, jamming were all done fast and hard until he passed out from exhaustion.  After 18 hours or more of sleep, it would start all over again.<br /><br />After decades of life pedal to the metal it is amazing that he survivied.  But he didn't just survive.  He cleaned himself up and became a better person.  It seems like he was a nice person.  He spent a lot of effort helping other musicians especially underappreciated blues musicians.  He insisted that his Double Trouble bandmates received the same salary as he even though clearly SRV was the only reason people came to see Double Trouble.<br /><br />The book also explores the mystery of the 1982 Montreaux Jazz Festival performance where the band was booed.  Besides a couple of freaked out hippies dancing in front, the rest of the crowd (probably arthouse goons) sat and watched the performance in contempt and booed enthusiastically in between songs.  The book offers an explanation, but perhaps in some minds the crowd's behavior at that event will remain an enigma.<br /><br />Summary: good book, well written.  If you like SRV, then you won't regret having gotten this book.event will remain an enigma.<br /><br />Summary: good book, well written.

The author describes himself and his actions without trying to win your praise.  A bad son, a bad brother, a bad friend, a bad husband, a bad father.  He does not try to hide his faults.<br /><br />He is also very candid as to his thoughts and feelings towards politics, people, the white man, events and whatever else.  He really opens up his heart and mind for the reader to plainly see in this book.<br /><br />He does make some rather crazy claims (like the Aztecs weren't making human sacrifices but performing open heart surgery) about some things, but his eyewitness accounts of events he personally witness and participated in are consistent with reports of other eyewitnesses so there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of his stories about his adventures in Nicaragua or other events of his life he describes.<br /><br />He's not a very likeable man.  One doesn't know whether to feel sorry for him or to dislike him.  For certain, one does feel sorry for anyone who ever crossed his path: his wives, his children, his friends...	2005-07-01

It does not try to hide that fact.  Not included are atrocities committed by the Indians against settlers.  But it is nevertheless a viewpoint that needs to be told, and Dee Brown tells it well.<br /><br />It's not the first book that reports from this viewpoint.  This book is similar to Helen Hunt Jackson's book which was written almost a century earlier.  Despite Jackson's depiction of unforgivable behavior, it not only continued but got worse as Dee Brown eloquently describes in his book.<br /><br />This book is easy so easy to read it almost seems like a novel, but unfortunately it is nonfiction.  The book is peppered with footnotes and references to documents that support the accounts, a quality that is often lacking in other books on this subject.  I've researched other issues at the National Archives, and let me tell you, it is time consuming and a pain in the neck to request a few documents.  The volume of material that Dee Brown cites in his book definitely took a lot of painstaking research and patience.<br /><br />I have two complaints:<br />1) It ends in 1890: atrocities and mistreatment of Native Americans continued for over a century.<br />2) It doesn't tell the many GOOD things that the evil white man has done.  Yes, there were people who did not kill, rob and/or imprison Native Americans.  Some were honest and treated them fairly, and some, like Helen Hunt Jackson, petitioned Congress and the President on behalf of Native Americans.  I wish those acts were included also.	2005-07-01

Professor Sachs describes his round the world adventures in working to solve some of the most severe economic conditions in modern history.  Thrilling was his account of making his proposal to an unbathed Eastern European leader into the night (while the leader consumed a bottle of whiskey and smoked an untold number of packs of cigarettes), working through the night to have a written economic strategy proposal by morning and then, months later, watching with fingers crossed the behavior of the economy after his plan was put in place.  Jeffrey Sachs is a high stakes player.  The well-being of millions is often at stake.  Disappointing was his account of how Russian and other world leaders ignored the majority of his proposals to transform the Russian economy.  I've read books about Geronimo and Crazy Horse, climbing Everest, and revolutions, and this book was just as exciting.<br /><br />Thrilling also is that it is possible to, maybe not eliminate, but greatly reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty.  Disappointing is the fact that the necessary assistance from the wealthy governments of the world probably will not materialize.<br /><br />This book is merely an overview of Professor Sachs's plan to eliminate the poorest of the poor.  This is about how to give the absolute poorest of people (those living on less than $1 per day) a boost up to the bottom rung of the economic ladder of development.  The poorest of the poor, Sachs claims, with no infrastructure, no education and no capital, are often achieving negative per capita economic growth.  Sachs claims that, once on the bottom rung of the ladder, these poorest of the poor will then be able to begin climbing.<br /><br />Professor Sachs suggests using \\"differential diagnosis\\" to determine the causes of deep poverty and devise a strategy to alleviate it and begin economic growth.  Decades of experience have taught him that different countries and different regions and villages may be impoverished due to different causes.  These impediments to growth must be first diagnosed through careful analysis followed by a strategy specifically designed to overcome these impediments.  His method is not a one size fits all approach.<br /><br />This book is not about enhancing development in economies that have are already on the economic ladder and growing.  Countries like Bangladesh, although poor, are already on a path to economic growth and, with small accomplishments in read per capita GDP growth every year, will be able to continue to improve standards of living.<br /><br />Criticism of this book began before the book was even available.  It's not surprising that the harshest criticism comes from those who obviously have not read this book.  Sachs is often criticized for failing in Russia.  The critics never point out, probably because they are not aware, that neither the Russian government nor outside governments and institutions followed his advice.<br /><br />A popular criticism of this book is that Sachs's solution involves merely throwing money at a problem.  This is perhaps the most misguided criticism.  Sachs's plan does involve development assistance from wealthy countries; however, the amount he suggests that is needed is no more than countries have already pledged to contribute.  Moreover, Sachs is clear that financial aid without a development strategy will produce little results.  Sachs proposes an analysis of the impediments to development at the village level followed by a diagnosis and strategy to overcome them.  A stable, honest government is essential in carrying out the plan.<br /><br />Another popular criticism is that aid has shown to be inadequate in addressing the problems of development.  Sachs addresses this issue in the book.  His argument is that the amount of aid has been so low in the most impoverished countries that it could not possibly have a significant long-term effect.  The governments in the United States invest30% of GDP in public goods - roads, bridges, ports, police and courts, education ($10,000+ per student in many areas) - in order to achieve a growth rate of 2% in real per capita GDP.  Should we be surprised that an investment of a few dollars per citizen is ineffective in Africa?<br /><br />Sachs is also criticized for suggesting that aid be given to corrupt governments where the money will merely end up in an off shore bank account.  Sachs is very clear throughout the book that it is imperative that the recipient countries devise and implement a poverty reduction strategy and stick to it.  Countries that are not committed to this \\"need not apply\\".<br /><br />In the end, Professor Sachs has made a good proposal that WILL be effective in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of deep poverty and a track record to prove it.  Unfortunately, his plan WILL NOT be implemented primarily because of resistance from Washington.30% of GDP in public goods - roads, bridges, ports, police and courts, education ($10,000+ per student in many areas) - in order to achieve a growth rate of 2% in real per capita GDP.

We have a booming economy, the highest real per capita GDP in the history of the US and the 2nd highest in the world, a historically low rate of unemployment and productivity growing faster than even Greenspan imagined.  Just how are we suffering from this immigration?  Answer: we aren't.<br /><br />As for the cultural effects, go to Honduras and see the larger cities peppered with McDonalds and Pizza Huts and see the young girls dressing like Britney Spears.  It's quite obvious that the rest of the world is more influenced by US culture than vice versa.<br /><br />And as to the cultural effects, I say, \\"Bring it.\\"  That's right.  Bring it.  Irish, bring your beer.  Italians, bring your reciptes.  Indians, bring your curry (but not so much).  Japanese, influence us with your work ethic and team work.  Germans, bring your engineering expertise.  All these cultures have enhanced American culture.<br /><br />When the rhetoric is removed and the actual evidence is examined, it's clear that immigration has caused no damage to the USA.

Yet this book is written so as to be easy to read.  The author tries to refrain from using technical terms but writes in plain English and explains the concepts so that they could be understood by the interested reader, not just economics students.  This is not a textbook.<br /><br />The author makes a strong case for the benefits of globalization.<br /><br />I would also like to add that this book is not political.  The author is not a political hack posing as an economist to provide another piece of propaganda for the faithful to feed off of.  This is a legitimate book that addresses globalization from an economist's point of view.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the author does not delve deeply into the many adverse effects that globalization can have on some individuals.  While society as a whole certainly benefits from globalization, some individuals can and do suffer temporary adverse effects from the process.  I only wish the author could have spent more time in how society can reduce these temporary adverse effects.  Martin Wolf is a brilliant economist and writer, and a deeper analysis by him of this area would have been beneficial.	2005-04-14

He was a civil war hero and missionary.  Yet he is accused of leading one of the most heartless, brutal massacres in American history.<br /><br />Was the Sand Creek massacre a misunderstanding?  Was it an intentional, cowardly massacre of a peaceful Indian village consisting of mostly women and children?  Or was it a justified attack against a group of hostile, bloodthirsty criminals?  Unfortunately, Bob Scott's book is not an objective analysis of the incident.  Scott, a long time admirer of Chivington who wrote a book praising him as a civil war hero, writes this biased book to defend Chivington, not to objectively look at the facts.<br /><br />The author attacks the testimony of James Beckwourth and Kit Carson who weren't even witnesses but doesn't address the accounts of Silas Soule and others who refused to participate.  He fails to mention a Private David Louderback who was in the camp at the time of the massacre.  The private was sent to escort trader John Smith.  If this group of indians was so dangerous, why was a private sent to trade with them?  Would you tell me?<br /><br />The author does honorably admit that a prisoner was summarily executed.  He also honorably admits that Chivington on several occasions made racist comments about his victims and encouraged the killing of even children.  These were well documented, and even the biased author could not dispute them.<br /><br />So that leaves us with the enigma of Chivington.  The Christian preacher, missionary and war hero who led one of the cruelest slaughters in US history.	2005-04-14

It gives a brief explanation of some widely held Catholic beliefs and practices in an easy to read book.  It also explains some of the more contriversial beliefs.  He gives a good explanation of how these beliefs and practices originated and why they originated.<br /><br />The assumption of Mary into heaven is called \\"The Great Assumption\\".  And what a great assumption it is.  It is based on absolutely no facts.<br /><br />This book also contains several other great assumptions like purgatory and praying to saints.  These are based on nothing other than assumptions.  The author calls this Tradition.  Some of these doctrines conflict with the writings of the apostles themselves (i.e. saints interceding for the living and calling someone \\"father\\").  The author admiringly admits this and proceeds to makes excuses for the false doctrine.<br /><br />Many of the beliefs and practices of catholocism are based on what the author calls Tradition.  He gives an indepth definition of what he calls \\"Tradition\\".  This is acceptable to some extent.

This book is NOT the same old same old.  No.  The author has original thoughts on almost every subject covered, and after reading the book and after careful, meditative reflection I have changed my opinions in a couple of areas.<br /><br />On Homosexuality: Dr. Campolo DOES agree that the Bible maintains that homosexuality is a sin.  He is clear.  But he believes that someone with a homosexual orientation can refrain from engaging in sinful acts and be acceptable to God and a good Christian.  Is this any different than someone with a bad temper submitting himself to God and striving to exercise self-control?  Many of today's churches are accepting of remarriage after divorce (something that Jesus addressed)yet hold homosexuals in contempt (a subject that Jesus did not address).  They protest in the streets against state recognized homosexual marriages without thinking twice (or even once) about divorce and remarriage.  Is it any wonder why homosexuals think we hate them?  Perhaps Romans 5:8 is missing in some of our Bibles.	2005-03-15

Well educated and deeply religious, he chose to spend much of his life in a lawless, bookless society.  No doubt the irresistable call of adventure as well as the curiosity as to what lies on the other side of that hill called the young man to this life.<br /><br />Most amazing is the stoic response to incredible hardships these men showed.  Being attacked by indians, scalped by a bear, lost in the mountains and walking across vast, unknown deserts did not deter this man.  Remarkable!<br /><br />Jedediah Smith's journal is one of the few sources of information about the lives and travels of the mountain men of the early 1800s.  Imagine the stories that would be available to us had more of the mountain men been able to document their adventures.	2005-02-11

Money certainly isn't the answer to all the world's problems, but it would certainly help alleviate some of the suffering.  It's sad that even after having read such heartbreaking stories few people wish to do the easiest act to help: write a check.<br /><br />Surprisingly absent from this book is the author's suggestions for a solution to the problem.  This speaks of Urrea's intelligence or perhaps how much he's learned from his experiences.  THERE IS NO EASY SOLUTION!  There is no remedy that can be written in a few pages in a book.	2005-02-07

The author outstandingly introduces to people, some of whom are his close friends, who live in an entirely different world and yet have the same desires and dreams as we although they are often too discouraged to dream them.<br /><br />The author, a reasonably intelligent man with a good education and experience, is also wise enough to know that there are no easy remedies to the poverty that afflicts the people in his book and so many others.<br /><br />The saddest part of the book is actually in Urrea's follow-up book, \\"By the Lake of Sleeping Children\\".  In it, he describes how people have contacted him about the region seeking to do research, write articles or event o a television show.  \\"Very few,\\" he wrote, \\"want to send money.\\"  Sending money is not the solution to poverty, but writing a check is the easiest thing to do to temporarily alleviate some of their suffering.  So go and have a good cry.  Then, after you get down on your knees and thank God for the blessings you have, consider putting your compassion into action.	2005-02-07

Many of the criticisms are legitimate concerns, and Dr. Bhagwati gives an economist's response to them.  He also discusses possible remedies in the form of government policies that could be implemented to lessen the adverse effects of the globalization process and enhance the benefits.<br /><br />However, many of the criticisms of globalization are so ridiculous that they don't even deserve a response.  Dr. Bhagwati devotes much of this book (too much in my opinion) to address them indepthly.<br /><br />Also, as noted, some of the criticisms of globalization are legitimate especially possible adverse effects on the environment and tribal cultures.  Dr. Bhagwati tries to write off these legitimate criticisms also.  He would have been much wiser to recognize these very serious concerns.<br /><br />And that is my major complaint about this book.  The process of globalization can have a detrimental effect on some individuals and some groups.  The book would have been much better had Dr. Bhagwati admitted this and addressed perhaps possible ways to reduce these adverse effects.  To conclude that globalization is good for all and painless for all just isn't realistic.	2005-01-13

The author reviewed thousands of pages of documents, conducted dozens of interviews and visited dozens of sites.  He reviewed evidence presented by both sides: the FBI and the Indians.  He considered the opinions of people on both sides.<br />  However, it's not just a research book.  The book is peppered with the author's own opinions and speculations as well as the opinions and speculations of other people interviewed.  He retells the story several times through the eyes of the different witnesses.  Some of the witnesses actually change their accounts more than once.  In the end, the killer himself (whoever that may be) is probably the only living person who knows what really happened.	2002-11-27

The author is candid in describing both the good and the bad in the people he meets and in himself.<br /><br />I mock at some of the people that society considers heroes.  The stories about SuAnne Big Crow and Billy Mills certainly describes modern day role model heros.	2002-11-02

The author never releases the hold she has on the reader for the rest of the book.  I read it three times in the first month.  I couldn't put it down.  So many books on Native Americans end in 1890 as if Indians dropped off the face of the earth after the first Wounded Knee.  This book is an eyewitness account of recent Lakota history.  A look at how many Native Americans are still struggling for civil rights and still struggling to find themselves.	2002-10-25
