They are in the middle of the events that occur between the humans and the goblins.    Makenna was a simple hedgewitch who joins with the goblins after her mother is murdered by humans due to religious problems by human leaders named priests.  Though she has simple spells, her alliance with the goblins who has their own set of spells makes great trouble for the humans wanting to inhabit the woods occupied by the goblins.    Tobin is a knight who has been wrongly accused for treason.  Due to his family's background, he is spared death and is given a chance to redeem himself by bringing in Makenna, who humans have come to believe is an all-powerful sorceress.    It took me a very long time to get into this story.  Probably because the story starts in flashbacks and it frustrated me because if it starts in flashbacks then maybe the story started at the wrong time.    However, it got really good near the middle of the book.  What fascinated me the most was a discussion of where the Goblin's power came from, hence where the Goblin's came from.  Then it went on to discuss how the Goblin power was evolving.  I found that very thought out and intriguing.    In the end, I found the book to be a fantastic and satisfying read.  I don't regret picking this book up at all.  It isn't just a book for young adults as fantasy lovers of all ages should enjoy this book.  Hilari Bell has written another book called \\"A Matter of Profit\\" and I look forward to picking that book up as well sometime.	2005-09-13

It is the second-to-last book.  This automatically means it needs to be the darkest and saddest of the books to build up to an emotional, whirl-wind finale. <br /> <br />Harry Potter returns in this 6th book of the series.  We meet up with him once again at the Dursleys as he awaits the beginning of his next year at Hogwarts.  But we also meet up with the government of the wizarding community who is having nothing but bad luck in the war against Lord -- well -- he-who-must-not-be-named. <br /> <br />After Harry gets to Hogwarts, new mysteries abound.  For one, Harry is getting mysterious help from the so-called \\"Half-blood Prince.\\"  Only because J.K. Rowling felt it necessary to share, I will tell you that the Half-blood Prince is neither Harry nor Lord Voldemort.  While trying to discover his true identity, he is also perplexed by the strange actions of Draco Malfoy and he also attempts to discover what it is that he is up to.  On top of this, Harry and Dumbledore are working together to piece together the past of Lord Voldemort so that they may discover what it will take to finally destroy him. <br /> <br />When asked if another main character will die, J.K. Rowling answered, \\"Yes.  Sorry.\\"  I don't think many really cried (as the author had) at the death of the main character in book 5 (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) but I can imagine that many eyes will not remain dry at the end of this book.  Mine remained dry, but this is only because I'm a self-centered, heartless, uncaring prat. <br /> <br />But it is not all woa and misery for Harry Potter.  Some good things do happen to him, one of which I had been hoping for since book 2 (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). <br /> <br />The mark of a good book is when you don't want it to end, and you couldn't put the book down until you got there.  Well, this is such a book.  The entire Harry Potter series has been fantastic, but I haven't enjoyed a Harry Potter book like this since the first one.  It is fantastically paced and almost impossible to set down.  The end is satisfying, but whets your appetite for book 7.  If you've loved the Harry Potter series, of course, don't stop now!!  You will find this book to be a wonderful read with its deep imagination, wonderful characters (familiar and new), mind-boggling twists, rich story, fantastic dialogue, and incredible ending.	2005-07-17

But it ultimately comes down to the story and I'm actually finding most of this to be a fun and engaging read.  Now, don't get me wrong.  This is not a book I would describe as being hard to put down.  There are some flaws in the story and the way a machine would react to things (for machines, they are waaaaaay to sentimental).  There are many story lines to follow and I started skimming through certain boring ones. <br /> <br />If you can't get enough of the Dune universe then I would recommend picking up this book.  We get an early glimpse of the creation of the mentats, Bene Gesserit, the sword masters, th empire under the rule of the Corrinos, and the Guild. We also see Arakkis (Dune) before the universe discovers its importance and the settlements upon it that become what we all know as the Fremen.	2005-06-29

As the Author of the book pointed out, dialogue is supposed to contribute and further a plot and make it interesting.  The problem with this book was that there was no plot to further and no story to make interesting.  This book isn't fiction nor should it be, this is a book on a non-fiction matter that the Author decided to turn into a story,\\" the Reviewer says. <br /> <br />\\"So, it doesn't work?\\" asked the Reader. <br /> <br />\\"Not at all!  In fact, the editor of the book is turned into a fictional character as well and even he or she is opposed to explaining dialogue in his chosen way.  If I want a story, I'll pick one up.  I wanted something that will teach me and this book wasn't it.\\" <br /> <br />The Reader contemplates the opinion of the Reviewer and asked, \\"How should it have been different?\\" <br /> <br />The Reviewer scratches his goatee while thinking quietly to himself and replies, \\"Well, first of all, this should not have been done in Dialogue.  Like I said, it didn't work.  It turned out to be a conversation that jumped all over the place and was very distracting from the subject matter at hand.  It should have been done in textbook style with subjects neatly covered before moving on instead of jumping back and forth between topics. <br /> <br />\\"Also, I would include story samples that were not written by the Author, as they all were.  That made me loose credibility with the Author. <br /> <br />\\"Finally, the Author thinks he is funny and hits us with a lot of `witty' dialogue during the banter between the Author, Fred Foyle, and Nan Dedditor (Nan the Editor).  Sadly, he isn't funny and it distracted from the subject and just plain irritated me.  If the bookwas not done in dialogue the `humor' would have not been in the book and it would have been better,\\" the Reviewer explains. <br /> <br />\\"But, was there anything good with the book?\\" the Reader asked. <br /> <br />\\"Don't get me wrong, I did find some useful information.  But you've got to dig for it and if you wish to refer to it later on, good luck!  The topics are scattered and revisited so much that finding anything again is complicated.\\" <br /> <br />The Reader then asks, \\"So, who should read this book?\\" <br /> <br />Again, the Reviewer thinks about it for a little bit, \\"I would recommend other writing and dialogue books long before recommending this one.  If you've got nothing else to read and still want to learn about Dialogue then pick up this book.  You might learn something.  But I don't think this will do much for most people who want to learn how to write better.\\" <br /> <br />The Reader looks the Reviewer in the eyes and says, \\"This review annoys me.\\" <br /> <br />The Reviewer looks back at him and says, \\"I am attempting to show you how this book is written.

I'm excited that the Dune universe is being expanded with the House Trilogy and the Legends of Dune and will even finish off the cliffhanger that Frank Herbert left us in his last book. <br /> <br />I read the House Trilogy and was fairly disappointed.  The story was somewhat interesting but lacked the depth and maturity that Frank was able to write.  I was mostly disappointed in that the entire series didn't seem worthwhile because we already knew all the events that unfolded in the trilogy.  Everything new they put in the books wasn't really worthwhile.  I was left a little reluctant to continue with the Legends of Dune trilogy. <br /> <br />However, so far so good.  It still lacks the depth and maturity that one would expect from Frank Herbert, but it is better written than the House trilogy and is actually discussing events that wasn't already known from Frank Herbert's books.   <br /> <br />From Frank we know that the Butlerian Jihad took place (and humans won) and that the feud between Atreides and Harkonnen started there.  There is very little else mentioned.  But the events of the Butlerian Jihad have a lot of effects on the society of Dune and it is nice to finally find out what happened there. <br /> <br />The story is interesting, despite its flaws.  We also see an early glimpse at the relationship between the Atreides and Harkonnens before the grand betrayal takes place, but I think we'll get a deeper look in the following two books.  We also get an early glimpse of the creation of the mentats, Bene Gesserit, Guild, and inventions such as personal shields and glow globes.  We also see Arakkis (Dune) before the universe discovers its importance. <br /> <br />In the end, I was left looking forward to the next book in the series.  I'm enjoying this look at the Dune Universe 10,000 years before the beloved story of Paul Atreides takes place. <br /> <br />Oddly, this is the first book without Duncan Idaho.	2005-06-14
US	52139318	RBL6T3CZGYO38	0553580302	698766211	House Harkonnen (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Why This House Series?	As I had mentioned when I reviewed House: Atreides it seems like these books are rushed.  Decades of thought were put into Dune before Frank Herbert put pen to paper, and yet Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson seem to crank one out once a year all while writing other books, comic books, book tours, and other distractions. <br /> <br />It seems that this is their specialty.  Because after this series they went right into wiping out another trilogy detailing the events of the Butlerian Jihad and now they are writing two more books summing up the events of Frank Herbert's masterpieces. <br /> <br />I did like some of the plot points of House: Atreides and you get a closer look at familiar (and non-familiar) characters from the Dune saga in House: Harkonnen.  But in the end, I was left wondering why?  Why, why, why?? <br /> <br />First, why the name?  All three major houses (Atreides, Harkonnen, and Corrin) are featured in all three books.  What little extra attention this book gave to the Harkonnen's was hardly worth calling it a book after their name.  More focus was given to the Atreides house in all three books. <br /> <br />My other why was why was this series written at all?  There really is nothing new here.  Everything new is unimportant, with the possible (slight possibility) of the stories of House Vernius.  Everything that was important is already already known from the first Dune book. <br /> <br />However, if you are a Dune fan I would still suggest you read this.  There is very little depth added to the characters we already know and love, but another visit into the Dune universe is still nice, fun, and comforting.  You get a slightly new perspective on the story of Dune. <br /> <br />I think the best thing they did was they didn't change any of the characters to justify their actions in the Dune novel.  Not once did I say, \\"Now, that isn't the Duke Leto I know,\\" for Duke Leto or any other character. <br /> <br />So, if you love Dune, consider this series.  Better yet, pick up the Butlerian Jihad trilogy.  I'm in the middle of that now.  It still lacks of the depth of anything Frank Herbert wrote but you are dealing with Dune long, long before any of this part of the story takes place.  We get a good idea of what the Butlerian Jihad was about, but this look into the Dune Universe is much more new than this series ever will be.	2005-06-13

I was one of those people who loved the original trilogy but have been, thus far, disappointed by the new trilogy.  However, if the movie is as good as this book then Lucas might have finally made the movie we've all wanted to see. <br /> <br />This story is obviously the final transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader in preparation for Star Wars: A New Hope.  The transformation is pretty believable (not perfect) as Anakin's emotions, desires, and passions overcome him and turns him into Lord Vader. <br /> <br />The bridge is also created that explains the death of Amidala, the erasing of memories of C3PO and R2D2, the elevation of Chancellor Palpetine into the emperor, the births of Leia and Luke, the destruction of the Jedi, and the hiding of Yoda and Obi-wan. <br /> <br />The book is pretty dark, though this will most definatly have some of the best sci-fi battle scenes ever and the light saber battles will be better than we've ever seen.  There are some dull parts when they are dealing with politics.  But the best part about this book and movie is that Jarjar Binks is in neither.  That should give it five stars alone. <br /> <br />With a few weeks left before this opens in theaters, the real question is whether or not to read this book.  My answer is, \\"That depends.\\"   <br /> <br />Do you want to know how the story goes before seeing the movie?  If so, then yes, read this book.  I don't think there will be anything in the movie that isn't in this book.   <br /> <br />Would you like to know what the characters are thinking or some of their motivations?  If so, then yes, read this book.  Matthew Woodring Stover does an excellent job of not converting the script over to simple dialog and a battle play-by-play. <br /> <br />Would you likely read this book after you've seen the movie?  If so, I would recommend reading the book first.  That has always been a general rule with all book/movie combos. <br /> <br />Otherwise, wait for the movie. <br /> <br />Inthe end, I must say that the book is very well written and very enjoyable.  The story is fast paced (maybe too fast paced in some areas, but these are Jedis -- not sloths -- we are reading about) and hard to put down. <br /> <br />The audio version of the book is wonderful.  Jonathan Davis does an excellent job with the character voices.  Okay, Yoda's voice was a stretch, but all of the other voices I thought were very close to dead on.  Mr. Davis also does a fantastic job of putting the right emotion into everything that was read.  Also, there are many sound effects in the background that add to the story.  For instance, when there is a space battle happening, you can hear Star Wars space battle noises in the background.  There are light saber noises in the background when they are in use.  And you can even hear the bleeps of R2D2 whenever he speaks.  This is one of the best audio books productions I've ever listened to, and I've listened to a lot of them.	2005-04-27

His presence was long past due and his death had me sitting there saying, \\"It's about time!!\\"  But his death set the stage for a wonderful book, and that book is Shadow of the Giant.    The overall story is fantastic.  There are three main, interweaving plots.  The first is Bean and Petra's search for their children, which Achilles has put in (usually unsuspecting) surrogate mothers in the previous book.  This is a good plot and you cheer as Bean and Petra look for and find most of their children.  This was left unresolved at the end of the book and I suspect that one or more of their children will be the focus of the next book, if there is one.    This is also Peter Wiggin's story, probably pretty close to what Ender Wiggin wrote in \\"The Hegemon\\" as Speaker for the Dead.  His desire to unite planet earth and what he goes through as Hegemon of planet Earth and his unification process.  It not only focuses on his strengths as the future world leader, but on his weaknesses.    And then there are the political parts of the book.  The children of Battle School and Ender's little gang are becoming the leaders of the biggest nations on earth and are practically declaring war on each other.  This was the weakest plot in the book, but still interesting.  Irregardless of weak plot, I can't think of anybody who could write it better.    The book is satisfying and leaves you wanting more.  But what do you suspect from an author as wonderful as Mr. Card?  What makes the book great, like Ender's Game, is the ending.  It isn't the big surprise that Ender's Game has, but it is every bit as satisfying.  A couple of times it almost had me in tears.  This has to be the best dnouement I've ever read.  There is even a brief \\"appearance\\" by Ender himself.    The story is a five star story... but the audio book wasn't five star material.  Like a lot of Ender's previous audio books it was performedby a cast, but it struck me that whoever produced this audio book did not know what he or she wanted with the cast.  First the cast took turns reading chapters.  Later, they took part in a conversation with two cast members reading different character's lines.  Later, two voices overlap and change mid-paragraph.  There was no consistency!!  Though when Peter speaks to the world as Hegemon at one point, it sounds like it is broadcasted through an early 20th century radio, which I thought was creative (but unrealistic for events that take place over a hundred years from now).    If you want to hear a cast done exceptionally well, listen to Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials.\\"   Maybe BBC Audiobooks America should listen and take notes, or just avoid doing the cast altogether.	2005-04-19
US	52139318	RQ2XK2V9UL7EA	0553580272	737842842	House Atreides (Dune: House Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Entertaining, But Nowhere as Good as the Original	Frank Herbert, before writing the original Dune novel, spent 20 years of research and story outline before putting one word on paper.  What resulted was the book that every other Science Fiction book is compared to. <br /> <br />Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson seem to crank out a Dune novel about once a year.  The result is that this book, while entertaining, is nowhere as deep, thought provoking, thorough and engaging as the original.  While the original had many feints within feints within feints, this one might get as deep as a feint within a feint.... maybe two.  A big complaint is the dialogue as you have characters saying things that Frank Herbert would never pen.  I actually found myself cringing with some of the conversations that took place. <br /> <br />The biggest thing that stirred my ire was that there is a scene that was a blatant rip-off of a scene from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Continent.  Don't worry, it isn't hard to spot, but it sent off warning bells immediately.  Heck, I dropped an extra star just because of it.  I would rather wait 2-3 years to get a really good Dune novel than one a year that takes from so many other stories.  Come on, Brian and Kevin, let's try and do some original thinking here! <br /> <br />With that said, I still found the book to be entertaining.  These books were written from Frank Herbert's notes so the events that unfold are largely from the imagination of Frank.  I found the pace of this book to be a bit faster than the other Dune books.  A lot of people complained that Frank's sequels were too drawn out and long-winded (hard to argue with that) so the quickened pace of the plot development is refreshing. <br /> <br />This does cover a lot of ground in the Dune universe.  I loved the original Dune books and wish Frank could have written more, but this series is still fun to read considering I have nowhere else to go to fulfill my Dune appetite.  So if Frank's original six books left you craving more than I would suggest that you pick up this book as well as the others.  However, if you will not be able to handle visits into the Dune universe that are nowhere as wonderful as Frank's books then shy away from book. <br /> <br />If you've never read Dune before and are considering reading this, I would discourage it unless you like those cheesy Star Trek novels that are basically cranked out in the same style.  I would highly suggest you pick up the original Dune book first.	2005-04-11

Unfortunately, Frank Herbert passed away after the writing of this book.  However, his son (Brian Herbert along with Kevin J. Anderson) has announced that he has found the notes for the remaining book(s) and am currently writing two more books to finish off the Dune series.  Therefore, while this book does end in a bit of a cliffhanger, this may be resolved within the next couple of years. <br /> <br />This book resumes a few years after Heretics of Dune and the death of Miles Teg and destruction of Dune.  The main focus on this book is the Bene Geseret as they attempt to turn their home planet into a replacement for the Dune Sandworms and also to battle the Honored Matres. <br /> <br />It all leads to a wonderful ending that is actually quite the cliff-hanger with many unanswered questions.  The biggest question concerns the Honored Matres.  While the Honored Matres are wiping out the Bene Geseret, they appear to be fleeing from another enemy themselves.  The enemy is not revealed by the end of this book, but I believe that this is the underlying purpose of Leto II's Golden Path. <br /> <br />So, that begs the question.  Should this book be read knowing that this ends in a huge cliffhanger?  Because the conclusion to the book is in the works I would say whole-heartedly \\"Yes!\\"  Because Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson are writing from the notes of Frank Herbert, the final books should contain the original story that Frank wanted to portray.   <br /> <br />Also, if you have read the other five books and are debating whether to read this one, well, you would be nuts to stop at the end of the fifth book and should not hesitate to continue on to this book. <br /> <br />I did find this an enjoyable read, though difficult and slow.  I have no regrets reading this book, even if it wasn't being concluded.	2005-03-27

The only familiar character is, once again, Duncan Idaho.  You get to know him even more than in all the previous books.  But there are now two new interesting characters.    The first is Atreides descendant Miles Teg who is a great warrior and leader.  He looks like the old Duke Leto Atreides and is called upon by the Bene Gesserit to help restore the memories of the latest Duncan Idaho Ghola.    Also there is Sheeanna, a young girl with the ability to speak to the great worms of Rakis (Arrakis/Dune) and the desire to align herself with the Bene Gesserit.    The story is not the easiest read, but it builds up to a powerful and fascinating ending that leads right into the sixth book.    The most interesting part of the book, I found, was watching how Duncan Idaho's previous memories were restored.  In previous books, other than the 2nd, it was just done before we even met the Duncans.  This time you get to experience what Duncan goes through, and how he feels, and this really makes these fascinating.    If you've loved the Dune universe and the previous four books, don't stop.  This is a great book to continue the Dune epic.	2005-03-11

Sure, the same old groups are there (Atreides, Bene Geseret, The Guild, and a remnant of the Freman) and there are two people that carry over from the previous tale (The Ghola Duncan Idaho and Emperor Leto II).  But this seemed to be nothing but conversations and lacked action, which the first Dune book was chalked full of.  But after became familiar with all the new characters I slowly began to like and then fall in love with this book. <br /> <br />At the end of the third book, Leto covered his body with the sandworms of Shai-hulud and in doing so became nearly invincible.  Following the \\"Golden Path\\" he started on in the third book, Leto controls the galaxy and is preparing the galaxy for the time when he must eventually pass on. <br /> <br />This book is high on emotion, much more than the previous books.  I feel that Leto becomes the most developed of all of Frank Herbert's characters (with the possible exception of Duncan Idaho, who I'm learning even more about in the fifth book).  You feel his loneliness, his troubles, and the demons that haunt him.  You will weep for the horrible sacrifice he makes for humanity. <br /> <br />The first three books lead up to Leto's reign.  If you are interested in seeing where the \\"Golden Path\\" reads, you really should continue the series.  This is highly recommended if you loved the first three books.	2005-02-23

That was 10 years ago and I am ashamed to say that I listened to them.  But after Dune: The Children of Dune the movie came out, and after reading good reviews here on Amazon, I decided to ignore them and read the sequels anyways (after re-reading the first). <br /> <br />In the end, I'm very glad I did.  The second book was a bit slow, but the third book really picked up again.  Don't get me wrong, this is not as fast paced or exciting as the first book, but I still found it an interesting and provocative read. <br /> <br />In the third book, we get to know the twins of Muad'dib who we saw as babies in the second book but have grown up a bit (mentally by decades but physically by 9 years).  Still present is Alia, Paul's sister.  Paul's mother returns along with many others from the first two books. <br /> <br />There is a plot underway to assassinate the twins and return power to House Corrino.  There is also something going on with Alia, who appears to be possessed by her grandfather, the terrible Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.  And there is also a strange preacher who preaches against the empire and religion set up by Muad'dib and ran by Alia. <br /> <br />As with all of the Dune books, there are plots within plots within plots.  You do need to pay close attention to keep track of them and who is involved. <br /> <br />If you love a great epic with a smart plot, unforgettable characters, and from the mind of a fantastic imagination then this book, as well as the other books in the Dune series, are highly recommended.	2005-01-31

It almost defines the genre and you can see its influence in almost all Sci-Fi literature today. <br /> <br />What makes Dune especially exciting is how complex and thorough it is.  Dune is not a simple story, but then, neither is life.  You have so many characters and groups of characters all with different and opposing objectives.  You see how the decisions and actions of one can influence the course of so many other groups of people. <br /> <br />The characters are all so real, deep, and believable.  The plot is sensational.  Getting this bird's-eye view of the rise, the fall, and the rise of the Atreides family is a real thrill unmatched by very few other books. <br /> <br />Yes, this book is a must-read even for those who do not read the science fiction genre often. <br /> <br />On a side note, I was warned in high school about continuing the series as most people I talked to considered it dull and boring.  I'm in the middle of Book 4 right now and I attest that while the next two books are not as fast paced as this one they are still quite interesting with a fun and complex story line.	2005-01-25

Paul Muad'dib Atreides is now the emperor of the known worlds and respected as the messiah of the Freman religion.  But a plot is underfoot to destroy his reign and get house Corrino back into the emperor's throne. <br /> <br />While this is not as fast paced as the first Dune, it is still an exciting read with just as many plots within plots within plots as the original.  It is a good portion shorter than the original and others of the series as this mainly focuses on the pregnancy of Chani, the desire of Irulan to have children with Paul, Irulan's involvement with the plot to bring Paul's downfall, the return of the ghola Duncan Idaho, the guild's fear of the events unfolding on Arakis, the finding of a dwarf who possesses the names of the enemies of Atreides who also has a strong role in the plot, and the introduction of many rich characters. <br /> <br />Frank Herbert may be a lot more philosophical (read: long-winded) in this book and its subsequent sequels.  If you can get passed all of that then you have an amazing story that I found just as rich as the original Dune book. <br /> <br />If you loved Dune I, then make sure you stick around and read this book.  If it doesn't tickle your fancy then drop the series.  But if you find it as intriguing as myself, you can thank me later.  :D  As for me, this was most definitely a \\"must read\\".	2005-01-25

But it just didn't really get me too inspired.  The plot was rather simplistic, the dialogue was laughable, and the characters were quite hollow.  It didn't do anything for me, but it is easy to see why some people can find meaning in these words. <br /> <br />I could recommend a list of books I would rather have read instead, though.	2004-12-22

I first re-read the 7 Habits to refresh my memory and happily delved into the 8th habit. <br /> <br />There is really two parts to the eighth habit.  The first part was easy to identify with, which is to find your voice.  How?  In a simple way of putting it, it is by excercising your experience with the first 7 habits, especially building the body, heart, mind, and spirit portions sharpened by the 7th habit.  There is more to it than that, which Covey goes into a lot of detail to explain.  And when I say a lot, I mean A LOT!!!!  His examples are good and easy to identify with.  This would be a strength of this book that I thought was missing from the original 7 habits.  But he still spent way too much time expounding on this.  However, the idea of TQM and 6-sigma blood-letting made me laugh out loud (a compelling and entertaining example of why it is important to have the right paradigm). <br /> <br />And then came the second half of the habit, which is to inspire others to find their voice.  But in reading this, it more appears that this was geared towards leaders within a business... whether departmentally or from the top ring of the ladder of your organization.  His theories echo those of many leaders including some of my favorites. <br /> <br />The first part of the habit I think would be wonderful for anybody who has internalized the first seven habits.  For anybody else, well, you might be pushing it.  The second habit would be more for top management of an organization or business students.  In fact, many of the principles that Dr. Covey touches on would go well with an OB or Management 101 class.	2004-12-22

Before his death, which happens at the beginning of the story, you get a brief glimpse of his life and personality.  After his death, Eddie is taken to heaven where he meets five people.  From each of these three people he learns what type of impact he had on their lives, and visa versa, and a lesson is learned to help him to more understand his life and find meaning \\"in it all\\".  In most of these lives, he finds he has had an impact more than he had imagined. <br /> <br />This type of story can easily become preachy... but I never thought that it had.  While I didn't really find much insight (there was a little) from this story, I would imagine that there are people out there that could learn something of their own lives from this story.  I can imagine why many people would feel touched reading a story such as this.  However, to cover all the bases, more than five people would need to be met and then this book would become rather repetitive, long, boring, and preachy.  Five people was a good way to hit many of the bases and keep the story interesting. <br /> <br />Despite the search for some self-realization, this is actually an excellent story.  I love character stories, and you find a fantastic character while exploring the life of Eddie.  He is easy to identify with and like.  The depiction of Heaven is imaginative and interesting. <br /> <br />Recommended, sure!!  You might find things in here that I didn't, and plus, it is a great story. <br />	2004-12-20

This isn't the first Card fantasy I've read (I like his fantasy much more, with the exception of Ender's Game and Shadow) but this was one of my favorites. <br /> <br />My favorite thing about Orson Scott Card is his characters.  And this book has the best of them all.  First there is \\"Price\\" Ivan who was born a Ukrain Jew who defected from Russia and ended up in the United States.  He meets the Christian Princess Katerina who was enchanted to fall asleep and would later on become the basis for Sleeping Beauty.  You have a talking, immortal, good natured bear who is married to the meanest meanie of them all, Baba Yaga (Okay, repeat after me, Baba Yaga... one of the funnest names to say aloud).  Can it get better than this? <br /> <br />This story is fun, interesting, entertaining, and educational with enough plot twists to be considered one of Orson Scott Card's best. <br /> <br />If you would like a good fantasy, give this book a try.  It isn't too long and the pace is very good.  The ending leaves you satisfied but, none-the-less, begging for more.  Probably not the best bed-time story for young children, but more for mature teenagers and up (there is a splash of needless swearing in it). <br /> <br />Come on, give it a go!!	2004-10-28

Usually over 40 hours a week (yes, it is full time job!!!).  I usually avoid abridged works but picked this one up because of a friend who really enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I got soooo lost.  Things were too abridged, conversations and situations were way too short, and I had trouble following the story.  In fact, I've given up after the first tape (that's HALF THE STORY!!!).  I mean, people were killed and others being healed and thing would change so quickly I couldn't remember who was who and had done what.<br /><br />If you want to enjoy this book, get the book.  From what I've heard, this really is a great story especially for those totally lost in the world of Dragonlance.  If you like Dragonlance a lot, don't waste your time reading this abridged stuff.  Either read the book or wait for the full version to come out.<br /><br />If I could say one good thing about this audiobook is that it is done with a caste of characters so that certain voices went with certain characters.  I've really liked stories like that.  Listen to the His Dark Materials works by Philip Pullman for a perfect example of how this should be done.<br /><br />But why people waste time making abridged works is beyond my comprehension.  Is the extra cost really that troublesome?  I would have bought the other two books, I'm sure.	2004-10-15

This is a difficult read from cover to cover (as I trudged through it), but it is a good book to keep around as a reference.  Not excellent, but good.  This isn't so much a \\"how-to\\" on writing setting but more of a \\"why setting is important\\". <br /> <br />At the beginning of the book the author (Jack M. Bickham) explains that not enough detail is given to setting in writing classes and offers this book as a means to fill that gap.  However, Bickham touches on most aspects of writing from the perspective of setting.  So, is your plot weak?  Look at it from your setting. <br /> <br />I would recommend that you read the first chapter or two and then keep the other chapters in mind if you feel you are stuck in a story and believe that an adjustment to setting could bring your story back to life.	2004-10-14

And for a elementary children, this is a wonderful book. The read is relatively quick so they aren't overwhelmed by the thickness and it is still a fun story with characters that you feel terribly bad for.  <br /> <br />The prose is perfect for children. It is easy to read and filled with alliteration. Best of all, this book goes out of its way to teach vocabulary to children. Instead of filling the book with long words (for children) expecting the children to look up the words they didn't understand (which they won't), it goes out of its way to explain the bigger words.  <br /> <br />This is the story of the Baudelaire siblings and continues where the second book left off as they are taken to their Aunt Josephine's house to be taken care of. While they have some initial problems with Josephine because of her neurotic tendancies, they feel safer in her hands than when they lived Count Olaf but not as happy as they were living with Uncle Monty.  Again, another scheme is hatched by Count Olaf to take control of the fortune. Again the only thing that can help the Baudelaire orphans is their wit, wisdom, and bravery.  <br /> <br />You are warned at the beginning of the book, and throughout, that this book does not have a happy ending. It is part right. The book does not have the best ending, but it doesn't have the worst ending either. I'll pick up the other books, but it does appear that this book will not leave you hanging and wishing for a different ending. Actually, I prefer this ending which shows that not everything will go your way which is the norm in life and not the exception. I don't think elementary school aged children are too young to start learning this, if they haven't already.  <br /> <br />If you have young children (grades 2-6) I would highly recommend you encourage them to read this series. This would be a good step into getting them to like reading. HarryPotter, while it is a fantastic read, should be left to those who are slightly older and/or better readers than who this book is targetted towards.	2004-08-23

He had to take Satan that he had written about in the five previous books and give him a history and make sense of what it was that he was trying to achieve.   <br /> <br />What is given to us is not only a Satan with a clear understanding of Evil, but a Satan who actually cares about others.  A Satan who actually cares for humanity.  A Satan who is misunderstood by others. <br /> <br />A lot of the mysteries of the previous five books are uncovered as a bet is made between Satan and Enoch on the fate of humanity.  This also explains why everything happens to Luna and her decendants the way they do.  At the end of the book, only one question is left open which is answered by the final book.  But this work of fiction was fun and thought-provoking.  If you've read the other five, you can't stop before reading this one.  If you haven't read the other five, read them first.  It makes this book more interesting.	2004-08-19

With Artemis Fowl, Eoin Colfer had done an excellent job of creating exciting and interesting characters and throwing them into a fun, fast-paced, and original story. <br /> <br />The Supernaturalist fell short of the Artemis Fowl series (I have no read The Wish List yet) in that the pace was slower and the characters were more dull and lacked substance.  Hands down, the best thing about this book was the climatic ending.  But it didn't leave me wishing for more. <br /> <br />If you liked Artemis Fowl, you won't necessarily like this book.

Any book/author that encourages youngsters to learn more about science and the applications of math, enhances the imagination about the far reaches of space and what it holds, and makes it fun and entertaining will, of course, be highly recommended by me.<br />This is the story of Kip Russell who's biggest desire is to make it to the moon.  This story not only takes us to the moon but also to the edge of our solar system and beyond.<br />There were two things that I really liked about this story.  The first was the desire by Kip's father that Kip obtain a REAL education, not just the simplistic and spoon-fed \\"education\\" of our public high schools.  I was also very impressed that this book shows the applications of math in science, though now-a-days a computer or a good calculator would be used instead of a slide-ruler.<br />There were some things that bothered me about this book, though.  First, the dialog was a little bit surreal and watered down.  The two \\"geniuses\\" seemed to be spending WAY too much time explaining to each other what was going on.  The other was the trial of the human species at the end of the book.  Actually, it was a trial of two different home worlds and it struck me that while there was very little difference between the two races, they received two very different sentences.  Those who stood up to support the human race did nothing to support the \\"worm faces,\\" and the result of the trial didn't amount to very much anyways.<br />However, I would highly recommend this book to anybody who enjoys science fiction and I'm looking forward to picking up more works by this author.	2004-05-18

Of particular interest is what happened to her shortly after Mym left... which is the setup for book #2 (Norton's love, Orlean) and the last book.<br />As with all of the other books, Satan is there to cause mayhem in her life as he continues to champion the cause of evil.  When Orb meets and starts to fall in love with a man named Natasha (his father wanted a daughter) she is warned by all of the incarnations that Satan might have a hand in it and to be on her guard.<br />This book is very good, and you see how all of the Incarnations are related to each other in one way or another... including Satan, the Incarnation of Evil.	2004-05-13

The best thing going for this book is that it is, for the most part, brief and to the point.  It describes the things that Trump believes will make you rich, gives an example of how he applied it to his life, and then moves on to the next topic.<br />However, his advice is generally bull crap.  If one can get rich by learning to play golf and screwing other people (both something he spent a lot of time on in this book)... there would be a LOT more rich people in the world.<br />Unfortunately, the book turned to fluff the rest of the time.  He spends a lot of time explaining who has made his &quot;screw you list,&quot; and ends with information about the Apprentice, season 1.  Now, I loved ever episode of it and I very much enjoyed reading how Trump got involved with the show.  But most of it sounded like a commercial for the show.<br />I did like some of his advice, but there wasn't that much in this book that made it astounding or original.  Bottom line: I don't think a single person is going to get rich reading this book.	2004-05-13

And, it just keeps getting better!!!<br />Piers Anthony does a wonderful job developing his characters and in this book, Mym and Orb are no exception.  We got an introduction to Orb in the prior book and it was wonderful to have her come back briefly in the beginning.  Mym, however, is a new character.  From the beginning, it is hard to imagine a pampered, stuttering prince becoming Mars... but Anthony does a good job of convincingly making it happen.<br />The only thing I did not like about this book was that the character development was a large part of the book and I had to keep asking myself, \\"Okay, so, when are they going to have Mym assume the office of War?\\"  But after assuming the office, it gets very good.<br />Mym is a lot like Zane (Death) from the first book as he assumed the office... not afraid to go against the status quo.  War is also like Death in that War does not bring on war (much like Death does not bring on death) but instead facilitates and manages it.<br />My favorite part of the book is when Mym finds himself in Hell and to get out of Hell he builds and army and attacks the forces of Satan.  I thought this was very creative and a lot of fun.  It was also wonderful to see War balk Satan twice in this book.<br />If you've liked the rest of the series, I would encourage you to continue reading it with this wonderful addition.	2004-05-13

This is the story of how he got there to begin with and his struggle to survive.<br />This is a fantastic read.  It is a lot like \\"Castaway\\" with Tom Hanks except this primarily takes place in a lifeboat and not an island.  There is also a lot of similarities with \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.  Unlike Hemingway, Yann Martel actually makes this story involving, reflective, and interesting.  Yes, Martel beats Hemingway!!!!<br />Like \\"Old Man\\" and \\"Castaway\\", this is a story of survival.  You see the difficulties and hardships that Piscine has to survive in order to see his adventure to the end.  His biggest enemies:  fear, lack of water, lack of food, carnivores (not just animal ones, either), loneliness, and a slowly loosening sense of sanity.  His biggest ally: God!!!<br />I loved this book and would recommend it for anybody looking for something interesting, fun, different, and/or insightful.  Yann Martel creates a wonderful character in Piscine.  He is philosophical and witty throughout the entire book.  It is fun to think, \\"What would I do in his shoes?\\"  This is a great book for readers of all ages!!!  I would highly recommend picking up this book.	2004-04-29

It is a story that took place several decades ago in the Deep South back when black segregation was unfortunately prevalent.  It is a story with a court trial that will show you the character of many residents of Clanton... but the court trial is not what makes this book amazing  (dislike a lot of Grisham novels).  Like To Kill a Mockingbird, the most interesting things about this book are the characters and their reaction to the court trial.<br />The biggest strength of this novel is the character development.  You see how the protagonist, Willie Traynor, grows from a new resident working for a small newspaper to somebody who owns the local newspapers and finds a good fit in a town who generally will not trust you unless they trusted your grandfather.  You fall in love with many of the characters in this book, including Miss Callie, a black woman with a mountain of faith in God and a strong desire to see her family grow up with as many opportunities in life as possible.  She is almost too good to be true, which is her only fault.<br />I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good character book.  The town is rich with a cast of lively resident and the story was nearly impossible to set down.  I really loved this book and I think you would, too!!	2004-04-29

But the ending to this series was rather disappointing and lacked the imagination that the first two books had.<br />This is the finish to the story of Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry as they fulfill their destiny that has been building up since the first book.  All of the major questions and mysteries are answered in this book, but I still felt rather disappointed.<br />What really brought this story to a screeching halt was the introduction of the mulefa.  While what she learns about them are fascinating, it is hard to keep a book exciting while describing a slow-moving group of creatures.<br />This book wasn't as fun as the other books, and was a lot darker.  As cheerful and fun as the first two books were, this book has got Lyra and Will all grown up, all too soon.  It seems like they've become responsible grown-ups too early and the exhilarating rush of the first two books are missing.<br />This book does leave you hungry for just one more, especially since the ending does not come the way you wish it would.  But if you have read and enjoyed the first two books, then you've got to pick up this book.  It is still wonderful, especially compared to a lot of crap that is out there, but it just wasn't as good as the first two books.	2004-04-29

Inside he befriends Lyra and finds a powerful knife which can be used to move between worlds.<br />Together, Will and Lyra join together to pull each other through their challenges as Lyra learns more of her great destiny and improves her understanding of dust and the origins and usage of the alethiometer.<br />The action isn't as strong as the first book, but this is still a wonderful story.  If you've read and enjoyed the first book I would highly suggest picking up this one and continuing from the first book's cliffhanger.  A lot of questions are answered in this book and a few more questions are introduced as well.  It all makes for a fantastic finish in the third book.	2004-04-29

It is nice to see the big story really start to develop.  I had started loosing hope on the second book (I would suggest skipping it) but am really committed to the story now that I've finished the third one.<br />Niobe is a character and her life is a real joy to read.

I stumbled across this book accidentally and was interested by the description of the story.  I didn't know if I would like it or not and figured that I would read it for an hour and if I liked it I would continue to read it.\<br />If you can't tell from my rating, the reading went on for more than an hour.  This ended up being very hard to put down and I really enjoyed the experiences of Zane as he learned the office and role of Death.  Of interest was the story of Luna (Zane's love) and Death's hand in thwarting the plans of Satan over her.  <br />Also of interest was the author's view of how Death is only a part of life and not something to be feared of.  It was nice to find this true message in this work of fiction.<br />I found this to be very imaginative and original.  I loved it and I look forward to the other books in this series!!  I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a book that is both different and philosophical.	2004-04-19

Sorry to say, I was very disappointed by this book.<br />For one thing, it took a quarter of the book just to get the hero of this book, Norton, to assume the office of Time.  At least half of this book was spent in what Norton believed to be another world having experiences that had very, very little to do with the story.  It did show a little bit of Norton's character, but it was a bothersome distraction from the real story.  This means that the real meat of the story was only told in 25% of the  book which, to me, is just a waste of time.<br />This book was really confusing and I felt that Piers Anthony could have done a better job of explaining of the office of Chronos, the Incarnation of Time.  I felt I understood Death's office very well from the first book but this book did not really show how Chronos worked in his office.  The only power he demonstrated did not demonstrate the responsibilities of his office.<br />I will probably pick up the other books because other reviews here seem to indicate that this is the most confusing and disliked book of the series.  I would recommend this book if you are going to read the entire series... but I wonder if the rest of this series could be told without this story.	2004-04-19

After finishing college, I wanted to lose the pounds that I had stored away while sitting on my butt studying all the time.  I had heard a lot of praises for this book, so I went out and picked it up.<br />The thing I liked about this book is that it really gives you a mental edge over your diet.  While reading this book, it caused me to reflect on my lifestyle and how a lot of the things I was doing was making me easily gain weight.  It teaches you how to eat properly and encourages exercise while setting your life up in a fashion that will allow you to more easily tackle weight loss.<br />I not only liked the mental edge, I do like the fact that this diet was realistic enough to recommend and encourage exercise.  Most diets claim that they can help you lose weight without any exercise but Dr. Phil actually is much more down to earth in the reality of that aspect.<br />The only part I disagreed with was the part dealing with WHAT to eat.  I'm not a big fan of starchy (ie, surgary) foods and was surprised to find that a quarter of each meal was supposed to be high in starch.  I did replace this with another diet (read my other reviews, you'll figure out which one).<br />Between the two, I have lost nearly everything that I wanted to loose and I did it with very little effort.  I would highly recommend this book to anybody looking to lose weight.<br />This audio version is abridged and things are left out that you should read.  If you like what you hear, make sure you pick up the book and read through that as well.  However, listening to Dr. Phil preach and teach these 7 keys to you really helps with the motivation.  His voice just makes you want to lose all the weight!!	2004-04-12

I liked the premise of this book... a couple of kids going back in time among the Nephites and Lamanites of old to experience their hardships, learn to apply touch lessons into their lives, and learn to love The Book of Mormon.  This story focuses on the time a few years after the Title of Liberty was raised by Captain Moroni.<br />This is the story of Jim who is in need of a spiritual experience to increase his faith and bring him back into the fold of the church.  He has help from his friend, Garth, a Book of Mormon expert, as they accidentally go back in time while searching some old caves.  Jim's little sister (Jenny) comes along as well and gets kidnapped by the Lamanites.  Jim befriends many common Book of Mormon heroes as they try to save Jenny and get back home.<br />For children over 9 or 10, this is a GREAT read.  It really brings the Book of Mormon to life.  For adults, well, I found it a little bit childish for my tastes but I have heard that the following books are more mature.  I'm looking forward to reading more about these types of adventures.  My only real complaint was that the ending seemed to wrap itself up too quickly.  It was almost like the author was tired of writing the book and just wrote to get it over with in a hurry.	2004-04-12

While this is not the best young adult series, this is still a lot of fun to read.  Also, it is a quick read that focuses on an interesting story without a whole lot of useless fluff that some books have.<br />This is the story of Artemis Fowl, a young genius with two desires in life:  gold and the sanity of his mother.  To pursue the former he launches an ingenious plan that involves kidnapping a fairy and holder her for ransom for a special fund that the fairies keep.  The outlandish characters are fun and interesting as well as the interaction between them.<br />A recommended read for kids of all ages (even us approaching 30).	2004-04-12

Unlike the first book, there is a lot more character development as you get a better look at the characters from the first book.  The largest development comes from Artemis Fowl, who, it turns out, actually does have a heart!!!  I must admit, that while I did enjoy the first book, the coldness of the main character really left a bad taste in my mouth.  That was resolved in this book.  I'm really looking forward to picking up the third book sometime.<br />This book is recommended for kids of all ages... but read the first book first because there is a lot of character interaction that you need to understand.	2004-04-12

I would have been happy if this novel were half as good as Ender's Game... and it was more than that.  This was fantastic, a real page turner that you can't put down.  If you loved Ender's Game, you'll love Ender's Shadow.<br />This is a parallel novel (not a sequel) to Ender's Game.  It is the same story only told from the perspective of Ender's right-hand-man, Bean.  Only it isn't the same story because there is a lot about Bean that Ender (and therefore us) don't know about.  Where did Bean come from?  Who is he?  Why is he so smart?  These questions and even more are answered in this story as we find out that Bean had more influence that we had thought by only reading Ender's Game.<br />If you have not read Ender's Game I would suggest reading it first.  The real story is about Ender, and while Bean is just as interesting a story, the story is best seen through the eyes of Ender Wiggin first.  But if you love Ender's Game, pick this one up and read it.  This only adds more life to the story.<br />Orson Scott Card, the master at creating loveable, believable, and fantastic characters, does an incredible job of bringing Bean to life.	2004-04-12

If you haven't read Ender's Shadow, or even worst... haven't read or listened to Ender's Game (the novel, not the short story) then there will be a lot of things you don't understand.  <br />I picked this because I loved the novel and thought I might listen to it from time to time (I've read Ender's Game twice and loved listening to the audio book as well) but I wish that they would produce an unabridged version as well.<br />Other than that, I just love this adaption and am glad I've added the audio version to my collection (I spend a lot of time in my car).  If you've loved the book, this is a great listen.  If you haven't read the book, I would suggest doing so over listening to this abridgement.	2004-04-12

Sure, there was one or two I didn't care for all that much (or, possibly, didn't understand) but on the whole I'm glad I picked this series up.

As a teenager, I had read all of Stephen King's works.  Now, as somebody who wants to write, I was very excited to have found this book.<br />This is really two books in one.  The first is a quick autobiography of Stephen King.  It begins with his family life... his mother and genius brother.  He wrote about some of the things that has influenced and inspired his life and his stories.  He wrote about how he first began writing and what life was like before and after writing success.  When I first read this, I was shocked to find him writing an autobiography instead of giving lessons on writing.  However, I not only ended up loving this section, but it also gave great insight on what it takes to BE a writer.<br />The next section is his \\"No bull crap (that was censored)\\" approach to writing.  He gave several tips on things to do while writing (like, of course, writing in the active voice) and he also gave several examples of things NOT to do while writing.<br />If you want to be a writer, you've got to pick this book up.  Stephen King is truly a master of the art of writing and found this book to be an invaluable addition to my library!	2004-04-11

I've heard nothing but good things about this book and thought I should go and pick it up.<br />I can see why people do nothing but rave about this book.  It is truly wonderful; a real work of art.  It is amazing that Harper Lee never wrote any other books.<br />This is the story of Jean Louise, known by her loved ones as Scout, and the experiences of her family and her home town of Maycomb, Alabama back in the 1960's when blacks were still largely oppressed by whites.<br />You fall in love with Scout, her brother Jem, her father Atticus, and most of the residents of Maycomb throughout the first half of the book.  Through the eyes of Scout, you really see how things used to be during that time.  Also, through the upbringing of her father, you begin to understand why some people do things that don't make much sense on the cover.  You learn to try and see things through there eyes before passing judgment.<br />However, in the second half of the book, judgment unfortunately come to Tom Robinson.  He is standing trial for raping a white girl and the events of the trial will unveil the true character of nearly everybody in Maycomb.  It is sad, but it is a real character piece.  While it is slowly paced, especially at the beginning during the characterization part of the book, it is still hard to put down.  The characters in this book become as alive and real as the people in your own town.<br />It is a book that will cause you to reflect on your own life, and how you treat those you meet.  It is a book that will make you realize the ugliness and terrible results of racism.  It is a book that every person should read whether forced to in school or not.  It is a book I will read time and time again.  It is a book I highly recommend.	2004-03-27

However, Nephi had testified many times his love for the words of Isaiah.  How can Nephi say that these words are so wonderful when all I could find was confusion?<br />A Sunday School student had suggested this book to me and after resisting for many years I took the plunge and bought this book.  I decided that I would give Isaiah one more shot.<br />And I am soooooo glad that I did.  First of all, Nephi was right, these are wonderful words.  You learn about the mission of Christ, what he has planned for the restored church and the children of Israel.  You learn what certain words mean and what reference Isaiah was trying to make.  I sat down and delved through this book cover to cover.  I now love and have a good understanding of the words of Isaiah.<br />I just finished reading 2nd Nephi the other day... the entire book this time.  I was actually looking FORWARD to getting to the compare Isaiah verses.  I loved it!!!  Also, I have found that reading other books of the Old Testament now makes a lot more sense and has more meaning for me.  This book will remain in my library for years to come.<br />Highly recommended, even for those well versed in the Book of Isaiah.  It has really added a lot of meaning to my scripture reading and has made me love the Old Testament and the Book of Mormon more because of what was written here.	2004-03-26

Very similar to Orwell's 1984, this is the visionary look of what happens when government has too much power to control our lives and censure our media.  In this story, books are the source of evil because they encourage free thinking and contain ideas that discourage the ideals of this government's philosophies.  To control what people think, books are banned and burned by firemen.  Firemen, as far as people believe (because books don't exist that disprove this), have always been around, burning books to protect the public from the evils they portray.  This is the story of Guy Montag, who is a fireman.<br />Guy Montag lives the life of any dedicated fireman.  He does his job, pretends to be happy, and spends much of his income on TV walls so his wife can have more people in her \\"family\\" in which to converse with (and be controlled by).  <br />His life changes when he meets his seventeen year-old, free-thinking neighbor, Clarisse.  Guy's eyes are open to a new world as he finds a new love for thinking for himself and discovering the wonders of books.<br />This book has really appealed to me of late because of my own new-found love in books.  If you don't appreciate having libraries in every town and an endless supply of books in which to enrich your imagination then you need to read this book so you can imagine what life would be like if books were banned along with your ability to think for yourself.  Consider this a MUST READ.	2004-03-08

I've been interested in technical writing and feel it would be a good addition to my repertoire of skills, which is why I wanted to find and read a good book on technical writing.<br />Based on many positive reviews here and on recommendations from others, I decided to start with this book and one other reference manual.  I quickly read this book cover-to-cover and was very satisfied by its content.  It was very thorough on covering every aspect of technical writing, even giving a glimpse of what a technical writer's daily life.<br />And the results?  I've written two technical documents since which have both won high praise by co-workers.  Even **I** am shocked at how well they look and how fluidly they read.<br />If you are interested in technical writing at all, don't hesitate to pick this book up.

As you read this book, you must realize that in order to avoid becoming what this book portrays, we need to fight the system now.  Because, as Winston learns, once the system is in place it is practically impossible to destroy it.  Keep this book in mind while our government makes specific policies... especially while we lose our freedoms and rights of privacy in the name of safety, fairness, and prosperity.<br />And what amazes me (but wouldn't surprise me) is how much the people love what they have; not knowing what they have lost.  It is amazing how government can set your mind at ease with the right propaganda.  A perfect example was how the government was saying how it had exceeded its prediction in the production of boots (which was actually a lie) and one of its citizens commented on how well they had done in supplying the needs of the people.  In the same breath he asked if Winston had any razorblades, which had become very scarce in the recent weeks.<br />And even scarier, it shows how easy it is for the government to twist (spin) our language and use it against us.  For instance, in the book we see the Ministry of Love, which is used to torture free thinkers and those who would disagree with Big Brother.  We see the Ministry of Truth, which is nothing more than spreading lies on the wealth of the nation and its citizens.  So on and so forth.  What is especially incredible about this book is the detail of the language that George Orwell went into, while creating a new language called Ensoc (English Socialism).<br />This book shows all of this... and more.  It is the model of what any country should NOT become.  There is a lot to learn from this visionary book.  You can instantly take a lot out of this book.  Read it and take a look around you and you will be surprised and how quickly our society is headingin this direction.  Fight this trend before you, yes you, fall in love with Big Brother.	2003-12-20
US	52139318	R1SXYQ4V4I6AIP	0451188462	562576523	Desperation	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Classic Stephen King!!!	It's been a while since Stephen King has written a book as good as this one.  I put this in the same category as The Stand and It.<br />To be honest with you, I didn't like the start of the book.  I had to force myself through the start of it and right when I was going to really give up... it got good.  Hey!!  Just like The Stand!!<br />But it didn't just get good, it got really good.  A real page turner once things started heading in the right direction.  I couldn't wait to put it down clear till the nail-biting conclusion.<br />I liked the characters that Stephen King created in this book.  As real-to-life as any Stephen King has created.  Marinville is a joy to read even though he can be a complete jerk.  The story of Steve and his hitch-hiking friend, Cynthia, is fun as they are thrown into the story.  But especially the story of The Carver family, and the young child, David. <br />The theme of this book is that God is cruel, and while his cruelty is refining, there is a purpose to everything that happens... whether it is good or bad.  While I don't believe God is as cruel as Stephen King makes him out to be (hey, this is through the eyes of Stephen King for crying out loud), it does make you stop to realize the small and simple (but sometimes large and complicated) things God will do in your life to bring about his will and good-will to man-kind.<br />A fantastic read and highly recommended... but this book is not for the faint of heart.	2003-12-12

Okay, being a has-been TV star and writing books telling people to avoid breads and dairy products does NOT qualify you to write a book on raising children.<br />Dr. Ruth Sharon's insites were sometimes good.  But Marilu`s additions were horrible.  Some of them didn`t even answer the question.  The perfect example was one woman who complained that she and her husband disagreed with if the children should keep their rooms tidy.  She then goes on and says what SHE does and how her brothers were known to grown interesting plantlife when she was a child.  THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION.  And one of the chapters she wrote just had me fumming.  I am convinced that Marilu Henner has any idea of what life is like in the real world.  It was a chore to make it through this entire book.<br />Reading this book is like shopping at a thrift-shop.  You`ve got to go through a ton of garbage to find a few pounds of something useful.  Some of their ideas were worth discussing with my wife.  But all in all, I don`t think the time I (quote unquote) invested into this book had any valuable return.<br />There are so many other parenting books out there that are more worth the time to read.  Don`t waste any time on this one.	2003-12-11

(and that's saying a lot)	This was originally written as a short story, which can be found on Orson Scott Card's web site [...]  However, while developing The Speaker for the Dead, he decided that it would best serve as a sequel to Ender's Game, his short story.  So, he turned the short story into a novel which won the Nebula and the Hugo award... the first author to ever win both in the same year.  Then, he wrote the sequel (Speaker) which one both AGAIN!!!<br />This book is a true work of art.  Mr. Card's ability to expand the personality, depth, and life of Ender Wiggin is truly incredible.  The added insite on why Ender was so special in proportion to his siblings makes this story wonderful and did an excellent job of creating plenty of fodder for the sequels.<br />This is a story which takes place in the future.  Earth has been attacked by an alien races (the formics) and by a shred of incredible luck, we beat them with a lucky shot.  But... will we be so lucky the next time the Buggers return?<br />Earth needs a leader.  Someone the likes of George Washington, Alexander the Great, George Patton, etc. etc.  Only he or she needs to be better.  This is where Ender comes in, a young child who has the makings of this great leader.<br />What is the best way to train a child?  Of course, through games.  So Ender is trained for years from very simple games to the unbeatable games (which Ender does end up beating).  But when Ender is better than any game put in front of him, those placed in command to train him must do all they can to improve his sense of command... even if it means cheating and changing the rules to put Ender at a disadvantage.<br />The real game is Ender's life and his sanity as he is pushed to the edge to improve his gaming abilities.  Will the leaders push him too hard or will Ender succeed in becoming the most brilliant commander of all time?  You will find out as you read this brilliant, fun, imaginative, and fantastic page turner.<br />This story is also told from the perspective of Ender's right hand man (child), Bean, in Orson Scott Card's parallel novel Ender's Shadow.  I would highly suggest reading this book first, but you get even more added insite by reading Ender's Shadow.  Both are must reads... especially if you love Ender's Game half as much as I do.<br />A movie is in the works with the screenplay written by Orson Scott Card... I imagine it will probably be as wonderful a movie as this is a wonderful book.<br />If you want to be thrilled, PICK UP THIS BOOK!!!  Also, the sequels are fantastic... not as fantastic as Ender's Game, but a great read in their own right as we follow Ender, his siblings, and Bean into old age... and beyond.  Out of 5 stars, I give it a 10!!!!	2003-12-02

It even appeals to me because the person that the loving sacrifice was made for was named Jim.<br />Now that the story is told with beautiful and lifelike illustrations makes it even more powerful.

When I had heard the Michael Crichton was writing a time-travel book I thought, &quot;Yes, finally, somebody who is doing to do it right!&quot;  However, in my opinion, he fell short of expectations.<br />For one, his multi-universe theory didn't really add up.  For instance, his theory was that it worked like a fax machine.  Except his reasoning behind not needing a fas machine on the other end was too unrealistic.  It seemed like he was taking the easy way out.  Also, I disliked his reasoning to why no paradoxes exist in time travel.  Again, it was the easy way out.<br />However, in the back of the book is nearly four and a half pages of books he read to research 14th century england.  The background information he had was incredible.  It really made me believe that what he was describing really took place back then.  I started wondering if he had built some multi-universal time traveling device to tidy up the rough spots in the book.  I`ve really got to hand it to him on such a thorough description of life in those times.<br />Would I recommend this book?  Oh, yes, highly.  I`m looking forward to the movie that comes out soon on it.  I hope the director paid as much attention to the details of that timeframe as Crichton did.	2003-11-20

It is very colorful and cute.  The children really enjoy looking at the book and counting along.  I bought it a little bit too late for my son (though he loved the other Corduroy books) but I co-own a day-care and the other children just love this book.  And since it is a board-book, it can withstand the abuse young children tend do dish out to books.<br />A word of advice, don't buy this book used.

He gives a wonderful story of how he made money opening up a comic book viewing \\"store\\" and he sites many examples of how he purchased assets and turned them into a great money making opportunity.<br />This book has done well on the best-seller lists and for good reason.  He advocates learning many financial skills but neglected to teach them himself.  But for those who are interested in getting out of the rat-race and becoming self reliant, this is a good book to start with.<br />My largest complaint:  he does take a while to get to the point.

This one is great as that any beginner to Windows XP will catch onto its concepts well, but even as an expert I've learned a lot of things from this book.<br />As an example, I was reading another book and it was telling me about a feature I could use.  I thought it was a great feature and went to try it out and it didn't work.  Disappointed, I figured that this particular book had just lazily copied the information from Windows 2000 (which it worked fine it).  Then I was reading this book and it explained that this particular feature is turned off by default in Windows XP and then explained how to get it turned back on.<br />That is what I love about this book... it explains in excellent detail the many quirks of Windows XP and how to fix them.  I've been looking for a book like this.  As an administrator, these quirks can be frustrating and whenever I pick up this book I seem to think, &quot;Oh, man... if I only knew that when I ran into that problem last week.&quot;<br />If you are an administrator, I would highly suggest have this book on your reference shelf.  Even better... read this puppy cover to cover.  It does cover a lot of the basics, but pay attention to the boxed sections marked &quot;tip&quot; and &quot;caution&quot; and &quot;InsideOut&quot;.  Even if you only read these parts, you will be a better administrator.<br />I will be very interested in checking out other materials written by these authors.

It is very informative and, hands down, the best out there.<br />Technical books are usually very dry, but this one explains programming concepts well with excellent examples that are easy to follow and implement into a T-SQL program.<br />This book has most definately made me a much better programmer.  I started off barely able to write a decent and effective SELECT statement and now I feel like I can do anything with this book and the Microsoft SQL Help File.  <br />This book does not cover database design or administration, so if you don't know anything about databases then you might want to start with a beginner's book and then move up to this book later on.<br />No doubt, this is a very highly recommended book.	2003-10-10

If you want to read a book with many level of symbolism, pick up this book.  If you are like me, and you are more interested in a good story, there are many others that I would suggest picking up.

Here is the story of a young man who is raised in the poorest of the poor in Limerick, Ireland who had to beg for food to eat, pick up coal off the streets for heat, write threatening letters to friends and family for extra money, and even help tear down a wall in his house to feed the fire.  It sure made me feel spoiled and appreciate the good life that I have.<br />I liked the stories.  Every childhood is this eventful, or at least should be.  You learn to like Frank McCourt and even identify with him as he questions the things in life, like the angel on the 7th step and religion in general.  You read as Frank McCourt spends years saving up money so he can do what his teacher urged him to do: Go to America where he can have more opportunity.<br />I loved this book and the movie did a very fair job of depicting the events of this book.  My only complaint is Mr. McCourt's lack of quotation marks.  Sometimes it is very hard to understand who is talking at a given time.  You can figure it out from the context, but you would expect more from an English teacher.  The quotation marks would have made it flow better.<br />However, I would not hesitate recommending this book to anybody.	2003-10-08

Story, story, story... why tell a story if it lacks story?  A distant second would be good character development.<br />This story has both.  And I love Stephen King's approach to telling a story this time... a group of guys (and a gal) sitting around, shooting the bull, and telling of their experiences with something that looks something like a Buick.  Story!!  Meanwhile, you gain a deep appreciation and understanding for nearly every character in the book.  It made me feel like I was listening to a bunch of guys swap stories around a campfire.<br />Is this Stephen King's best work?  Definately not.  But that should not stop you from picking up a copy of the book.  It is still a fun read, though a little bit slow at times, that builds up to a satisfying ending.<br />If I were to find a complaint about this book, it would be Stephen King's choice in constantly shifting viewpoint characters.  I guess this was the ideal way to tell this story, but I felt the transition between viewpoints weren't done very well.  Especially since they all sounded like Stephen King!!  Maybe that was my disappointment, the viewpoints and backgrounds all changed (and even genders) but they all sounded the same.<br />I also think one of the strengths of this book is Stephen King's depiction of these small town state troopers.  You learn to love them.  You learn to appreciate them.  You almost get the impression that Stephen King was a trooper all of his life.  My hats off to Stephen for such wonderful reality.  BRAVO!!	2003-08-26

It struck me how well he was able to protect the leaders by using common scare tactics (\\"Listen to Napoleon or Mr. Jones will come back\\") and changing the rules, or commandments, to suit the desires of Napoleon (adding the words \\"in excess\\" to the commandment that animals are not to drink liquor).<br />This book explores the possibility of a utopian society and is closely fashioned to the vision of the communist party.  While its founders have good intentions (Ol' Major and Snowball), the downfall comes from overzealous, greedy, and corrupted leaders (Napoleon).  Can Utopia be created?<br />There are many, many lessons to be learned from this book.  There is something for us all, especially if you are interested at all in politics.  It is good to remember this book so that we, unlike the animals on Animal Farm, don't slowly become enslaved by the leaders sworn to protect us.<br />Notice the word slowly.  At the beginning, a revolution takes place where the Animals take over the farm, establish their noble 7 commandments of Animalism, and the people appoint Napoleon and Snowball to guide them in their new society.  Napoleon is quick to take power from Snowball and begins using Animal Farm for his own greedy purposes.  He abandons and changes the rules of Animalism to suit his purposes.  Old traditions, such as the anthem sung by Ol' Major and the markings on the flags symbolizing the work of the common beast, are done away with.  So are the committees created by Snowball for the improvement of the animals.  Napoleon surrounds himself by bodyguards and, through an act of cleansing many of his enemies, begins to rule the farm in fear.  No animal seems too shocked when the pigs begin to walk upright like their enemy, but are more shocked to see the whips come out again.  In the end, the leaders become the very people that Animal Farm was created to be protected from and are duped into a worst lifestyle than was given to them previously for the welfare of the leaders.  This didn't happen overnight, this happened over the course of a few years.  In fact, most of the animals on Animal Farm weren't even part of the original revolution.r enemy, but are more shocked to see the whips come out again.  In the end, the leaders become the very people that Animal Farm was created to be protected from and are duped into a worst lifestyle than was given to them previously for the welfare of the leaders.

He has such a wonderful way of explaining things and illuminating certain details.  His writing skills really impressed me.<br />This had the potential of a five star story but fell short in a few areas.  The biggest one was his characters.  While you learn to understand the motivations of the main character, Benjamin Chase, a war hero with a past that he is not particularly proud of, the rest of the characters just don't make any sense to me.<br />For instance, we have a homicide detective who has 1) the ring of the killer, which is a BIG clue that should lead right to the killer, and 2) somebody claiming to be in contact with the killer.  He can't figure nor seems to do anything with the vital clue (#1).  He also ignores Ben (#2).  The detective believes Ben originally, but gives up on him too easily and on such false pretenses.  I can almost understand taking the cop/guard but he could have left the phone tap behind so Ben could record the incoming calls.  Was it being put to use elsewhere?  I doubt it.<br />It seems like the murder victim had some lousy friends.  His &quot;lover&quot; couldn't care less he had died or that she, too, had witness something utterly horrifying.  She was shocked at first, but recovered quickly.  A little too quickly.  In fact, a lot too quickly.  The best friend also doesn't care because, hey, we all die anyways.  I don't know, I think most teenagers would have a little bit more reflection on their own immortality.<br />And then there is the shrink... WHERE TO BEGIN????  I'll leave it at that.<br />And I can't go over the victim's parents without giving too much of the story away, but there that doesn't add up either.<br />Ben also picks up a love interest during the course of this story.  This story would be better without even mentioning her.  It added to the story's disbelief.<br />The basic plot of the story started off good.  There is a psychopath who wants to execute others for their sins.  Okay, that is fairly believable.  But then at the end you find out the true motivation of the killer.  Oh, boy.  Boy, oh boy, oh boy.  I won't give it away, but he should have stuck with the original idea.<br />I will probably give the author another shot sometime in the future.  As I stated, his writing ability is wonderful.  Hopefully other stories are a little bit more thought out and more believable.	2003-07-26

Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.<br />This was two stories in one.  The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with.  The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.<br />The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book.  Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen.  As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.<br />Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book.	2003-07-09

I was one of the few people not completely thrilled by book #3 (at the end of 2002) and thought I would stay away from Harry Potter and read this closer to the release of book 5.  However, my lovely wife bought me a copy for Christmas and since I had a little spare time on my hands, I went ahead and read it.<br />To be honest, the first half of the book I wondered why I was putting away my studies for this book.  It took Harry Potter that long to finally get to school, much less really get into the main plot of the story.  It just seemed to drag on and on and on all surrounding a Quidditch match that Harry wasn't even in.  Sure, it gave us a good introduction to many key figures, even for book 5, but I thought it could have been shortened a lot.<br />But after arriving at Hogwarts and the drawing of Harry's name from the Goblet of Fire... things REALLY pick up.  For the rest of the book, I just could not put it down.<br />I loved it.  It was fantastic and a brilliant read.  Harry begins to become a great wizard in this book.  And that is when I love reading Harry Potter the most, is when Harry is learning the craft and becoming the person that will fulfill his destiny (as later learned in book 5).<br />Dispite the first half of the book (which I docked a star for), this is a great book.  If you've read the other three books, there is no reason to pick up this book.  I didn't regret reading it.  If you haven't read any of the other books, pick up book one (or where you've left off) and enter the wonderful world created by JK Rowling that is full of imagination and wonderful storytelling.	2003-07-06

Andrew Duthie) did not write clearly.  For instance, in the debug chapter, he wanted you to view a document called 'trace.axd'.  The author wrote, \\"Appending trace.axd to the base URL for the application will display the list...\\"  I had to read that sentence about ten times and still did not know what it was asking me to do.  The picture that followed helped me to figure it out.  This is just one example, and since it was at the end of the book, the one most fresh in my mind.<br />If you are unfamiliar with ASP, I don't think the author had you in mind while writing this book.  You can't read more than a couple of pages without it saying, \\"In classic ASP...\\" or \\"...unlike classic ASP, ASP.NET...\\" or something to those effects.  This might confuse somebody who is new to ASP (and ASP.NET) as it provides more information that we really want to know about.  At the beginning of the book he explains that ASP.NET is totally different from ASP.  I think the author should have left it there and left ASP in the past (where I think it belongs).  He did include an appendix on upgrading yor applciations from ASP to ASP.NET, which is good.  But continuing to bring up \\"classic\\" ASP in the book I think is bad.<br />This book is divided into four parts.  The first part is aimed at the beginner to help somebody new to ASP.NET start programming with the basic programming of VB.NET explained and what makes ASP.NET different from ASP.  It also gives you a brief (too brief) introduction to the server components you can add to an ASP.NET web page.<br />For the final three parts the author really started losing me.  It was like he was writing at level 3 and then shot up to level 8 between part 1 and part 2.  He would casually write about topics and use terminology not defined earlier in the book.  The only chapters I really got information out of was chapter 9 (Accessing and Binding Data, a brief inroduction to ADO.NET) and chapter 14 (Tracing and Debugging ASP.NET applications).  Chapter 14 should have come MUCH earlier in the book.  However, half of the examples provided did not teach me much, and often times did not work very well.<br />All in all, I would not recommend this book, and regret buyin it (and paying retail on top of that).  There is much better out there.	2003-07-03

But it is worth the read anyways.  Think of it as the Sean Hannity Show without Man on the Street.  If you like listening to Sean (which I do) then pick up this book.  It is like getting a blast of his show without any liberal idiots calling in, pick up this book.  If you would like a little ammunition while debating your liberal friends, pick up this book.<br />If you are a liberal... ummm... skip this book.  Hillary's would probably give you more to go on.  This book was not written for the liberal but for the conservative.  In my opinion, this book isn't even written to change anybody's minds, but to support the fight for liberty for those who already agree with Sean.	2003-06-26

I love it, could not put it down.  It offered many tips from the trade.  Best of all, and this is more than worth the money, it has once again inspired me to write.<br />Now, I'm not going to become the next OSC by reading this book, and there is no single book that will teach you how to become a wonderful writer (especially not in under 200 pages), but this is a great book to get you going.  It is no small wonder that this won Card another Hugo award.<br />There are other books in the series.  I can't wait to pick them up.	2003-06-26
US	52139318	R1NRSOBEIAVCJ4	1573458082	856259335	Storyteller in Zion	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Thought Provoking	Okay, okay, okay.  I might be coming at this with a little bit of bias.  OSC is my favorite author (other than Mormon, Moroni, and Ether of course) so it is hard to be overly critical of this book.<br />However, it has caused me to think.  I don't agree with everything stated in there, but I don't think this book was meant for you to do that.  I think Card wrote this book not to persuade, but to get people to think.  And, for me, it did.  It seemed the only thing he really argued for was in his first chapter, whether the Book of Mormon was artifact or artifice.  I really enjoyed that, it defended the BOM from a point of view that I had never considered before... that of a writer.  I think my favorite chapter was the one on Consecration.  This chapter made me feel about three inches tall (standing on my tippy-toes) and made me reflect on how little I am contributing to Zion... and how much I need to make sure I change that amount of contribution.<br />If you are looking for deep Mormon doctrine or something to boost, create, or expand your testimony, this is not the book for you.  If you would like to get a feel of being an artist in Zion, some of the thougths behind OSC, and/or some inspiration then you might want to pick this book up.	2003-06-26

I enjoyed watching Harry grow up a little bit as he continued in his journey to fulfilling his destiny. Even if he spent the first half of it being a big jerk to nearly everybody he (and we) cared about. But, it was a good reminder that, yes, he is human. And a teenager.<br />It was also nice to see some questions finally answered... and I eagerly await the next edition as the war continues between him and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.<br />The only reasons I knocked it shy of 5 stars was that I didn't think this was the best of the series. Book 4 (or at least the second half of it) was a lot better. Also, there were a lot of errors in the book, but that probably occured because of the great lengths JK Rowling took in keeping the story a secret. Though I should consider giving her back that star for how well she DID keep it a secret (I was surprised that I hadn't found an illegal copy of it on the Internet before release date). There were also a few bits of the book that seemed to drag for some unimportant reasons, which might have more relevancy in future books for all I know. If it were an option, this book would really deserve 4.49 stars, but I rounded it off.<br />One thing I did notice while reading this book, it did remind me of Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. The many similarities between these two books are astounding. D.A. could easily have stood for Dragon Army.<br />Looking forward to Harry Potter 6!	2003-06-25

But I feel like he could have done an excellent job summing it up in 20 pages... or less.<br />He mentions at the end that you need to hear something 200 times before you really learn it.  Well, it seems like everything is repeated more than that.  After getting through half of it I found myself getting aggrivated with its redundancy.<br />If you are the type of person who does not like being told to do something several dozen times (hem, hem... I'm sure that is most men) then don't buy this book unless you run across some cliff-notes or something.<br />If I were to advise John Gray I would have written two editions.  The Venutian edition would be thick explaining men and their caves to women while the Martian version would be thinner, to the point, and only repeat things two or three times on women and their wells.<br />Other than that, I thought this book was really good and contained a lot of useful information that I have used and will continue to use to communicate with my wife and other Venutians in my life.	2003-06-25

It most definately makes you think (and fear) about computers and what it can do to our society.<br />I have a big complaint that books written about computers are often way off the mark (ie, The Net).  But this one does extremely, extraordinarilly well.  A fast read that is hard to put down.  This book has made me a Michael Crichton fan.  I'm excited to start reading his other works.	2003-06-25

However, this is THE MASTER.  I have read the entire Ender series and this one seemed to be the most predictable and the least entertaining of them all.  But let me back up a bit, this is STILL a great book.  I bought it and could not put it down.  Though I can't put my finger on it exactly, this book was missing some of Card's magic.  Something seemed to be missing.  Probably because we've already seen everything up Achilles' sleeve and this didn't bring out anything new.<br />I loved the further character development of Bean and those in his life.  As always, there were the ethical delimnas he struggled with (though it was nice to have him not struggle with the last bit of action he had to perform at the end of the book) while trying to save the world and protect those he loves.  The ending was very good.  And of course, this is all opened up to a sequel.<br />Great book, highly recommended.  I'm looking forward to the next release when we follow the further adventures of Julian.	2002-09-01

Orson Scott Card is a marvelous story teller.  The plot is wonderful, the character development is fantastic, and the ending is marvelous.  There is nothing bad I can say for this book and it is little wonder it has won several awards and is now being developed into a movie.<br />But don't stop with this book.  The adventure continues with the other books written on these characters through the eyes of not only Ender but of his right-hand man (boy), Bean.	2002-07-22

I've needed to refer to each book SEVERAL times to take care of one problem or another.<br />My only complaint, now, is that it is outdated by design (in other words, it is printed).  The withholding of a star may be a statement about Microsoft and their tendency to release buggy software, but as service pack after service pack has been released, I find myself trusting this information less and less.  I always read from the reference books and then double check online to make sure it hasn't changed, as that has happened on occassion.<br />If you are getting these books, I would advise you to do the same.  Microsoft's support page should be bookmarked in your browser.	2002-02-19
US	52139318	RU53RTABSKFEG	0782125093	670742250	TCP/IP 24seven	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Hard to follow	This book covers a lot of information, but it is very hard to follow.  Gary does not describe things very well.  I'm not just talking about the typos in the books (only a few), but he doesn't really cover what I want to  know.  He only goes over the basics of how something works and then  explains how to set one up.  Very rarely does he cover the actual  management of things like DNS, DHCP, WINS, and others.  I still have the  same questions that I had after reading the Microsoft material.  There have  got to be better TCP/IP books out there with better explanations of the  materials.  Even the organization of how he presents the topics don't make  sense most of the time.  For example, on page 139 he has an excerpt about  getting more information about RFCs and yet he hasn't discussed RFCs since  the previous chapter.  How about presenting this information when you first  began your (brief) explanation on what RFCs are.  Don't waste your time on  this book.   The story-telling aspect is the only thing making this book  readable and understandable.	2000-04-20

If you have read the other three books, drop what you are doing, buy it, and read it.  Hey, what are you doing reading this review, just buy it already!  On a serious note, this book was fabulously written.  My only wish is that  it had focused more on Ender and his involvement in everything.  However,  his 'children' filled in quite well. The character development was  fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed the play between each and every one of  them.  I could feel the emotions and pains of them all. In three words...  just buy it.	1999-11-03
