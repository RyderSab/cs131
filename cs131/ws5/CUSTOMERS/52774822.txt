I have been birding for 23 years. My life list is a respectable 450 species in North America. While some reviewers may not carry this book around, I will guarantee you the National Geographic Society (NGS) Field Guide to the Birds of North America is the #1 choice among every birder I know.<br />On my shelf I have a dozen guides...in fact probably every one published. Some are better for some things (such as Sibley), but overall this one is HANDS DOWN my favorite.<br />What makes it so good? With due respect to Roger Tory Peterson, the illustrations and written clues in the NGS guide are unmatched.<br />Secondly, in the 4th edition, National Geographic has demonstrated a fervent desire to keep up with the ever-changing naming conventions from the American Ornithological Union. Other guides simply do not keep pace.<br />If you are new to this hobby, this is THE guide. If someone told you they are interested, but they don't know where to start, this is THE guide to get them.<br />The one to get if you only get one. The one to use if you have many.	2003-01-23
US	52774822	R3KW04RKJEQ98E	0674006135	160288803	The Structure of Evolutionary Theory	Books	5	35	41	N	Y	Superb, but not a walk in the park.  A really tough read.	Cleary the capstone to Stephen Jay Gould's life and career.  While his hundreds of articles in NATURE put him at the same cocktail party with Carl Sagan, this tome puts him at the same party with Charles Darwin.  Another reviewer hit it on the head.  This book is not as accessible as his other writings.  The Structure of Evolutionary Theory is intended for the experts in the field of Evolution.  It presumes a lot of the reader, background that frankly even with a BS in Zoology, I don't have.  At 30 bucks, it's a great value for the money, one of those books you'll keep around and read a chapter or section at a time.  I don't think Gould intended to be pedantic, but he was clearly thinking at a level above most of us.  A quick excerpt to demonstrate my point.  From the bottom of page 152: &quot;The challenge of punctuated equillibrium to natural selection rests upon two entirely different issues of support provided by punctuational geometry for the explanation of cladal trends by differential species success and not by extrapolated anagenesis, and for the high relative frequency of species selection, as opposed to the exclusivity of Darwinian selection on organisms.&quot;  If you can figure this out, even in context, you can have my Mensa card.	2002-07-26
US	52774822	R37VJ2NXEUL2KS	0312276885	840537150	The Sigma Protocol	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	Fitting Closeout to a Wonderful Career	Many of the other reviewers are right.  This is Ludlum's best book in years, but I can't place it on par with the best in recent fiction.  I have been a Ludlum fan since day one.  And perhaps like you, I was disappointed in his later efforts, but few were as adept at weaving a story.  That is taking a thread here, a thread here, a thread here and building a tapestry.  Unfortunately THE SIGMA PROTOCOL turned out to be less of a tapestry and more of an afghan (no pun here).  You feel the tugging of a great concept, but are led from the prospect of an enormous, implausible worldwide conspiracy to an implausible conculsion.  Many questions are left unanswered.  Along with Stephen King's BLACK HOUSE, this is the second book in as many months which has used the theme of world-wide missing children to bolster the story.  Both results belong closer to the science fiction aisle than the horror or mystery section.  In the end, a good read.  Buy the paperback for a rainy weekend.	2002-02-06

It IS hard to follow the many travels of The Fellowship, and later all the other bands and armies moving all over Middle Earth.  And perhaps this book is not perfect, but I think it does an amazing job of anchoring the story.  Using this as a reference while reading the Trilogy is indespensible for placing the travels in context.  These books are a journey...the stories of journeys.

Long ago (1977) and far away (I think he may have still lived in Utah) Orson Scott Card managed to jot down one of the most captivating stories ever written.  The saga continues.<br />Taken out of context, SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON is not Card's best work.  But it does an amazing job filling a nagging gap in Earth's post-Bugger War history.  We always knew Peter came to be to Earth, what Ender was to the Galaxy, but we didn't know much more than that.  Card weaves a beguiling story that dovetails perfectly with the first five books.<br />I found SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON facinating from the continuing perspective of &quot;gifted youth who are forced into greatness.&quot;  In the most powerful fiction, it's difficult to imagine how the human race could have placed its future entirely in the hands of youngsters, but 25 years ago, only Card guessed the prowess of youth against the Game (the video game).  Today, I know precious few adults who can whip the average 10 year-old on PlayStation2.  If and when war comes to full-scale computer-driven battle, is it such a stretch to think Earth would turn toward youth?<br />And in HEGEMON, only Card could build a plausible sceario which effectively answers how youngsters could be so important to the future of Earth even when the computer-driven Game is not the overarching center piece.  Card says it in his end notes &quot;A giant game of Risk.&quot;<br />For years (bordering on 2 centuries) Earth pulled together as one people against the Formics, the Buggers.  Political infighting remained civil--words not arms.  With the war over the great powers are back to their old games and desires to control Earth.<br />Card, shows as no one else could, how and why children (Battle School graduates)make the differnce.  And for his female fans, I think he does a fantastic job developing two very powerful female characters.  We can all use more of that.<br />If there was an overarching disappointment, it's that Card supposes human nature won't change, even after Earth was one against an alien race.  The seed that spelled doom for the Buggers, is deeply planted in the human psyche.  I prefer more uplifting themes.  Who needs reality?<br />So, good book?  Yes.  Great book?  No.  But Card says there are 2 more to come.  Let's consider this a new base from which to launch the next great chapter in this saga.ange, even after Earth was one against an alien race.

My favorite section in a Barnes &amp; Noble, or Borders is the &quot;Staff Recommends&quot; section, that little corner where real people tell you about good books.  On &quot;Marie's&quot; recommendation in Fairfax Virginia, I picked up THE GOLDEN COMPASS.  I got home before I realized it was intended for Young Adults.  No matter, I'm 47, by page 10 I was hooked.<br />The Golden Compass is wonderfully written and gripping.  Philip Pullman does a 'fantastic' job wrapping an engaging story around a concept I had not seen in 20 years of reading fantasy.<br />Gifted children will love this story, but I think it's too complex for new readers.  I say, 'gifted children' because I find they love the challenge of a youngster forced in to greatness by no choice of their own.<br />Such is the fate of Lyra, who to avenge the kidnapping of friends and acquaintances in her psuedo-real Oxford University neighborhood, enters a quest of epic proportions to save them. Along the way she enlists the aid of fantasy characters so real, you will laugh and cry along with her.<br />There are armored polar bears who talk, witches who fly on boughs of pine, a &quot;compass&quot; to help her find her way, and a long-lost relative yearning to be found.<br />Highly recommended for all whimsical, young-thinking readers.	2000-11-28

Gone for Soldiers was an interesting read, but not engaging.  As a military officer, I had a big problem with the incredible inflation characters like Robert E. Lee received.  Hundreds in that war had more impact, yet because of Lee's later success, he got the focus in this novelization.  Mr Shaara was remiss in his treatment of the war from any Mexican perspective.  Most notably lacking was a better treatment of the chilren from the military academy who were defeated at Chapultepec Castle.  Their legend has achieved near saint status in Mexico, so it would stand to reason US audiences would want to know something about their sacrifices.  Also missing was the treatment of St Patrick's Brigade, a very interesting subplot about the Irish-American conscripts who turned coat in the vicinity of Mexico City and began fighting for the Mexicans.  They too get heroic mention in Mexican versions, but are ignored here.  Certainly a novel covering the Mexican-American War using speculation about real people is a tough nut, but the book would have been a better read had more of the perspective from the other side been included.  In post-script I would have added that a large percentage of our problems and misunderstanding of Mexico today, stem from this most egregious intervention.  Who, after reading the book, can truly say they have any idea why we were engaged in that war?  Mexicans have NEVER forgotten.  It shapes their view of the US and the subsequent land-grab that was 50% of Mexico in 1845.  They aren't happy to this day, and who can blame them?	2000-10-03

One recent book interest has been adventure stories including THE PERFECT  STORM, INTO THIN AIR, ENDURANCE, etc.  I had shyed away from ISSAC'S STORM  because I couldn't imagine what Larson could tell me I didn't already know  about the 1900 disaster at Galveston.  I shouldn't have waited.  Even the  most seasoned weather geek will learn from this book.  Like Carl Sagan,  Larson has a knack for putting complex concepts in layman terms.  I took  away new simple descriptions of tropical meteorological concepts.  However,  that is not the genius of this book.  Erik Larson did a wonderful job  piecing together thousands of bits of information and crafting it all into  a gripping read.  What's missing?  Photographs. Like SHIP OF GOLD IN THE  DEEP BLUE SEA, this book is screaming for a companion book of photos.  Eric  said he waded through over 4,000; 250 of the best would make a super  addition to this treatise.

The thing I like about this book is it does not presume anything of the reader.  I don't care how good you are, or how long, or how little, you have been playing guitar,  you should get this book.  You WILL learn  something.<br />Starts from dirt simple and goes to special articulation.  Unless you are a pro, you will find a chapter in this book that challenges  your ability.  Golf for Dummies is the best Golf Book ever written.  I  think Guitar for Dummies is a very close second.	1999-02-21

I find myself weighing every other Stephen King book against The Talisman.  If you like books about precocious  youngsters who are driven to extraordinary feats, then this book is for  you.  As much fantasy as horror, it is not easily categorized.  Read it.  My teenagers loved it too ... when they were still in their teens.	1999-01-27

Sir Ernest  Shackleton attempts to keep his crew of 27 alive for over 2 years ...  stranded, unprotected in the Antarctic.  It's true. It's true.<br />Alfred  Lansing's 1959 account drawn directly from the diaries of survivors is a  superbly-written, gut-wrenching experience.  You cannot put this book down.  One of the absolute best books I have ever read, hands-down, period...dot.  Order this book right now!!	1998-08-23

I first read Ender's Game on the recommendation of my brother in 1986.  I am a constant reader, but Ender remains the single best book, of any genre, I have ever read.  Don't misunderstand.  This is a very simple book to read with very simple concepts, yet a powerful theme and message.  I can recommend few books to all ages, but I have seen this one become the favorite of 8 year-olds and 80 year-olds.<br />Science fiction?  Well sort of, but that would scare some folks off.  It's the characterization in Ender's Game that gets you hooked and keeps you hooked.<br />Plot?  Leaders of Earth search for the admiral of the fleet that will fight the coming invasion.  Even at light speeds the invasion is years hence, so they have time to find a very young genius and train him with a series of games.  The kid is Ender.  He is very good at games.<br />Read this book.	1998-07-21
