I especially liked pg 197 concerning the reference to Mozart and of course the trucks. then add gruesomeness. most authors do not combine them all, or if they try, its not impressive. Koontz is awesome!	2005-06-14

Koontz last few years have rendered very good books with a few exceptions.  this book was definitely a waste of my precious reading time.  i skipped over several chapters to get to the end which rendered nothing of value.  i quickly emailed my friends advising them to skip this one.	2004-06-22

Grisham's humor and wit are delightful. I may be a little prejudiced (born and reared in the south).  I have known people like the characters in \\"The Last Juror\\",especially Miss Callie.  Some white people were like that too. One being my mother, who is no longer with us.  I have no doubt where she is, if there is truly a hereafter.  One never went to my mothers house and left hungry.  Also, I and my brothers and sisters were never allowed to go to the \\"show\\" or play cards on Sunday.  I found it amusing that Miss Callie might administer the death penalty for adultry as easily as she might for murder.  My dating days with warnings about how my mother felt about premartial sex would be a good analogy for me.<BR>Our lives have changed so much since her death but I fondly recall her love for us and her many friends.  This book awakened many wonderful feelings.	2004-02-14

Inspite of the frightful encounters these characters get themselves into; I find myself laughing with delight at absolutely marvelous thoughts of elvis(failing to move on), morality opinions(regarding the phone booth), normally mundane shopping experiences(ice cream and tires), and such.  Keep up the good work.  I can hardly wait for another book.	2004-01-22

I am enjoying this book tremendously.  it takes place in areas in which i have lived or visited; raleigh, nags head, knoxville, chapel hill and durham. I have traveled on the roads, ferries and waters .  The plot is exciting.  after seeing so many reviews stating that this is not Iles best, and since this is the first of his books I have read, can't wait to read the rest. so i must return to this book right now. i am indeed obsessed.	2003-10-21

I am therefore a little biased in my review.<BR>This book is actually the very best of all his books.  I enjoyed his delightful humor as he mixes it with the horror.  I have not read Dean's early works as I am not fond of books based on weird creatures, space aliens and such.  I am so glad I did not stay away as I would have been deprived of the talent I now cannot wait to read.<BR>Most authors burn out after awhile---not Koontz.  He only gets better.	2003-06-09

Of course by far a simplified version.  How about the wife situation?  Lose one to tragedy but find another quickly.  Did'nt that happen in both books? Ken Follett did a much better in depth story about that period of time.  In fact I am surprised that Follett's is not a classic.  The Jester was not one of Patterson's best.	2003-03-10

It reads like one of Grishams slow courtroom dramas.  Only slower.  It seems that everyone must have an affair.  Thats what authors do when they don't have substance.  This was like a grocery store paperback.  Sorry.	2002-11-10

All the characters lack depth.  It made me think of the book, The Prince of Tides.  Someone with problems goes to New York to find himself.  But the Prince of Tides had so much more.  In fact, it is one of my favorite books.  I cannot believe I spent several hours reading this book  hoping something would happen to make me believe that it belongs in the best seller category. Actually I never read it all, I skipped to the end after finishing two thirds of it. Surely this author must be related to the publisher and was due a favor.  I am so glad this selection was a loan from the library and I lost only valuable time.	2002-09-06

The characters were not people one would like to have as best friends. Ray could become special with a little encouragement. I could imagine the wonder of discovering his find (do not want to divulge too much).  It could happen to any of us.  I could see my Dad as the father and could relate to his style of no nonsense lifestyle.  I recommend the book to all of you who like Grisham.	2002-02-10

I especially enjoyed the humor.  His gift of writing page turning books has returned to an even higher level.

Its very good.  So many authors who do well in the beginning, run out of steam.  Baldacchi is better than Grisham. And Cornwell,  after just &quot;trying to read&quot; Isle of Dogs and finding it so shallow and boring, this is wonderful.  Will write another review when I finish. Gotta go see Harry Potter today so Baldacchi must wait.	2001-11-17

That book was all about feeling sorry for oneself and reviewing everything that happened in earlier books.  What a waste.<BR>However, Isle of Dogs is so boring. I read about a third, then decided to check Amazon to see if I was missing something.  Seems about everyone agrees with me. Some of the humor is interesting.  Especially since it is new for Cornwell.  The plot is so silly.  Cornwell's first four books were great.  After that, beats me what happened.	2001-10-19

But like &quot;The Bretheren&quot;, there was no fantastic ending like in &quot;The Firm&quot;.  His grandmother was so like mine.  She was generous to anyone in need. The grandfather was also like mine, quite stubborn.  The grandfather showed more love to the grandchild, Luke, because   its so hard for him to outwardly show love to his own children.  The church events were humorous.  Luke's reflections on things were funny too, however, I do not think 7 year olds are ever that perceptive.	2001-02-21

This book is  not the best of her works like Shell Seekers or Coming Home.  However, I  like anything she writes and look forward to her books.  I have read them  all.  Sit down in a big chair with something you like to drink and go on a  magical trip.  You'll feel like you're right there with the characters. Do  not look for sleeze, just comfort.  When you complete the book, go hug  someone.  You can hardly resist.  I'm booking a trip to Scotland.	2000-08-31

Imagine being married to such a wonderful storyteller.	2000-01-23
