In the end, she has to choose between Alexie and Nicholas, a Tsarist soldier whom she fell in love with before meeting Alexei.<br />The back cover reads: &quot;In 1917, war-torn Russia is teetering on the brink of the Bolshevik revolution.

When the Cossack captain, a man of dark and compelling desires, discovers Katya's background, he has no intention of allowing her to leave or to deny her evident desire fo him.

She is a writer and a woman comfortable being a spinster, such so that she hires a male prostitue for her thirtieth birthday.  As it turns out, the man that comes to see her is not who she thought it would be, but Jack Devlin, a business tycoon who is interested in publishing one of her stories.<br />The book is fast-paced and the story is telled in Ms. Kleypas's usual way: full of hotter-than-hot scenes that will keep you warm at night.  If you want a story that has hot scenes as well as love, then this is the book to get.<br />The back cover's blurb reads: &quot;She was unmarried, untouched and almost thirty, but novelist Amanda Briars wasn't about to greet her next birthday without making love to a man.  When he appeared at her door, she believed he was her gift to herself, hired for one night of passion.  Unfogettably handsome, irresistibly virile, he tempted her in ways she never thought possible...but something stopped him from completely fulfilling her dream. Jack Devlin's determination to possess Amanda became greater when she discovered his true identity.  But gently bred Amanda craved respectability more than she admitted, while Jack, the cast-off son of a nobleman and London's most notorious businessman, refused to live by society's rules.  Yet when fate conspired for them to marry, their worlds collided with a passionate force neither had expected...but both soon craved.&quot;<br />S.	2001-06-08

For some reason, she's been going back to her  original roots--that of the historian--more and more.  Don't get me wrong,  I like to read the historical events in her books, but I would love to read  more about the characters themselves and less about the history in the  future.

Along comes Madeline, who makes Logan feel an emotion he doesn't  trust.  She's hard-headed and althought her predicament was real, I didn't  feel much sympathy for her.<br />I was pulled into their lives as the story  progressed; and although the end was quite good, I felt that Madeline gave  up very easily.<br />The back cover blurb reads: &quot;Because the  Dream...Young, high-spirited Lady Madeline Matthews is expected to wed an  aging, lecherous lord.

Ever since I bought it a couple of years ago, I've gone back to it again and again.  I just can't get enough of it!  <br />While it's true that Margo seems a bit too  spoiled and selfish at the beginning, you also come to understand her  motivation for using her body--which is her only asset--to create a world  for herself.  Margo is not all bad.  She's caring about her friends, and in  her own way, she does things for them.  She gives them support, and is  there when they need her.<br />I liked Josh from the beginning.  He could  easily have been a very snobbish, spoiled person, but he wasn't.  He cared  very much about his sister and nieces.  The good relationship between him  and his family was evident, and that clearly says something about  him.<br />Although we don't see much interaction between Margo and Josh, the  reader does believe that there is a caring, loving relationship developing  between them.  Although Josh is a bit too possessive, it's reasonable since  he's had to do without Margo for a very long time.  Personally, I like them  and think that they would be great people to know.<br />If you like the DREAM  series, you may also want to try the MacGregors, the BORN IN trilogy, the  Stanislaskis, and the O'Hurleys.	1999-12-29

He was danger. He was love...and she was meant to spend forever with him. Trouble was, the almighty Kingman Marshall insisted marriage was  for fools. But for better, for worse, Tiffany vowed she'd walk down the  aisle as King's bride. She was young, beautiful...and totally off-limits.  He was too old, too jaded and too burned with secrets to indulge in  fantasies of happily-ever-after with sheltered virgins. But what he  wouldn't give to carry the ravishing Miss Blair over the threshold to  womanhood. Be careful what you wish for...&quot;<br />Althought I like Diana  Palmer very much and I've read lots of her books, I have to say that I was  disappointed by this one.  There just weren't any real emotional  connections between the hero and the heroine.  The ending was lacking and  the whole plot was a bit...flat.<br />Try &quot;Color Love Blue,&quot;  &quot;Dark Surrender&quot; (written as Diana Blayne), or &quot;Fire  Brand&quot; (written as Susan Kyle) for great stories.	1999-12-23

A man who attracted and repelled, teased and  tormented, until she was caught, trapped, drowning in a raging torrent of  chuming emotions and irresistible desire.&quot;<br />I believe Ms. Palmer's  style is a constant.
