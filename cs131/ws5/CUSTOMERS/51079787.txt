As a conservative Christian, I believe in the inerrancy of the Word of God, and Dr. Waite had some good points.  In the book, he has a section entitled &quot;superior translation technique,&quot; and I agree with his assessment.  Being a student of both Greek and Hebrew, I appreciated Dr. Waite's affirmation that the WORDS of Scripture are important.  After reading his book, I had much less of an appreciation for &quot;dynamic equivalency&quot; and favor the word-for-word approach.  However, I must take issue with his unwavering support of a Bible version that makes use of such late manuscripts (some of the verses in the KJV have no early textual basis, and some are as late as the 12th to 15th centuries).  He attacks the modern versions of the Bible for denying the deity of Christ, and he gives several examples of this by comparing the KJV with other versions. Tending to use the NASB, I checked some of his examples and found them wrong.  He accuses some of the modern translations as stating that Jesus was the Son of Joseph rather than the Son of God, but interestingly enough, in the KJV in John 1:45, Jesus is called the Son of Joseph.  As a born-again believer in Jesus Christ, my faith in His deity isn't shaken by this in the least.  Mostly this book has a lot of rhetoric and not much else, but it did give me an appreciation for more literal translations of the Word of God.	2002-07-24
US	51079787	R1DCGFV99EQDX5	0553561952	759809265	Indiana Jones and the Hollow Earth	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Rather quite British	Actually, I think this book deserves three and a half stars.  The plot was excellent.  I looked forward to reading about Indiana Jones exploring the inner earth and finding a race of &quot;supermen&quot;, but as so often happens in fiction books, small details get missed that cause the book not to be as good as would have been had these details not been overlooked.  First of all, everyone who's seen the Indiana Jones Trilogy well knows that Indiana Jones is a rather crusty, if intelligent character.  This book, however, presents him in such a way that I expect he should be eating scones with Earl Grey tea.  His vocabulary in the book was definitely more British than American (why, I wonder?).  Actually I found the dialog for most of the characters, well...rather out of character.  Secondly, I was dismayed at the poor German used in the book.  For example, the author has an SS man using the word &quot;javolt&quot;.  The correct word is &quot;jawohl&quot;.  Additionally, the author mistranslates the SS motto by stating that it means &quot;my honor is pure&quot; rather than &quot;my honor is loyalty&quot;.  A quick look at a German dictionary would have done the trick.  It was still a fun story even though it stretched credibility in these areas.	2002-03-02

I bought this book after seeing the movie of the same name starring Sean Connery, with the view that the book had to be better than the movie.  It wasn't.  While admittedly a fascinating story, the book was saturated with dialog between Brother William of Baskerville and his pupil Adso of Melk, which made the reader feel as if he was intruding in a personal conversation.  Additionally, there was entirely too much Latin used in the book.  If the Latin were confined to an isolated phrase here and there, fine, but I found myself having to skip entire paragraphs, because they were written in Latin.  This made the book very difficult to read, and although I knew the premise of the book from having seen the movie, very difficult to enjoy as fully as I'd hoped.  It would be a much better book if footnotes translating the Latin had been included, but it was a fascinating story nevertheless.	2002-02-14
US	51079787	RXX9AESJL5ZPW	0804105006	843613118	Inside the VC and the NVA	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Great book	Overall I thought this was a great book.  It went into great detail concerning even the most mundane details of VC/NVA life (I consider this an asset, not a liability).  I enjoyed reading about how they fought, what kind of weapons they used, and the tactical and logistical details of the various VC/NVA units discussed.  This book is limited in scope, after all it is called \\"Inside the VC and the NVA\\", so of course it's not going to go into detail about the ARVN fighting ability and THEIR details, nor does it address allied \\"atrocities\\". There were some drawbacks however.  The VC and NVA interviews were interesting, but I think the information contained in them needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Although the authors address and dismiss the possibility of coercion, I think that's a very real possibility.  Secondly, the book could have done without the input of the generals.  For the most part, I thought the comments of the generals were suspect.  After all, they had the kill ratio/body count agenda.  All in all, a great book.	2002-02-14

Oulton's translation is a must for the scholar and church historian.  This volume (Books VI-X) addresses such things as the Novatian heresy, various martyrs, the Apocalypse of John, and Constantine and the acceptance of Christianity as the Roman religion.  In addition to addressing these fascinating topics, Oulton's translation gives footnotes to explain some of the more ambiguous things addressed in the books.  The best quality of this book is that, while the reader gets the English translation on one side, the reader also gets the Greek on the other.  An essential work for the scholar and church historian.	2002-02-14
US	51079787	RQB16C9LMA476	0061097500	330150179	Katastrophe	Books	2	0	2	N	N	A marginal read	With the lack of the traditional summary on the back cover of the book, I had no idea what the book would be about.  However, as I had a five hour wait for my next flight, I figured I'd give it a shot.  For the most part, the book was a long, drawn out story.  I had a few major complaints about the book, one concerns the language.  The author attempts to have some of the characters speak German, yet the forms used are improper.  As a student of German, I found it disheartening that the author used the full verb form when he was trying to have the characters use the imperative.  The story was that much less convincing because of the linguistic errors.  There was also a historical error.  The author has the elderly Hitler Youth members listening to Strauss at a party.  A brief study of the history of the Third Reich would reveal that the music of Strauss was banned in Germany at the time, because Strauss was Jewish.  Elderly Hitler Youth members, then, would most certainly NOT be listening to Strauss.  Additionally, there was a factual error that any editor should have caught.  Initially, one of the characters is paid one million dollars, but further in the book and with no explanation, the fee is changed to a hundred thousand dollars, and the author stays with this for the duration of the book. So which is it?  One million or a hundred thousand?  That error also made the story more difficult to read.  I give the book two stars because the latter third of the book was quite a page turner.  All in all, though, I would recommend skipping the book altogether.	2002-01-17

Straightaway the author has a propagandistic style, glossing over the way in which Saigon was &quot;liberated&quot; by the Communists.  This book is a day by day account of the fall of Saigon, and the author includes interviews with key Communist leaders, such as Tran Van Tra.  It is definitely an interesting read with some great photographs, but I believe that the author shows a definite bias toward the Communists, and his bias often gets in the way of honest reporting.  It's a good book to read if you want the other side's perspective.	2001-08-12

This particular volume of &quot;The Vietnam Experience&quot; series takes the reader through events concerning Vietnam beginning with the Second World War and ending with the presidency of Diem.  There are many seldom seen photos in the book which the reader will find appealing.  The only problem with the book is the left-wing slant.

The Prologue definitely got my attention, and I kept wondering &quot;what's going to happen with this?&quot;  As a Baptist seminary student, I found Kienzle's insights into and explanations of Catholic theology personally helpful in understanding that faith and the politics within it.

This book was great in that it had great information on the war, which it  often gave from the soldiers' perspective.  The photos were excellent, and  the book would've been better with even more photos.  The only real problem  I had with the book (really the whole series) was the left-wing slant it  contained.  This particular volume devotes entirely too much space to the  incident at My Lai.  There was much more going on in Vietnam than My Lai,  so in that sense it lacked balance.  All in all, this was a good book.	2000-08-14

The plot is great, and I had such high hopes.  The plot, however, was not enough to keep my attention for very long.  The book droned on and on.  The book didn't have  much to keep the reader's interest at all.  Generally with adventure  novels, one finds enough action to keep one's attention until the climax of  the story, but this was not the case with King Solomon's Mines.	2000-07-30

Most books on satanism are written by  theologians, but it was interesting that he was a policeman.  Another  benefit of this book is that it educates the reader on various satanic  groups, including the Church of Satan, Santeria, and Wicca.  This book also  contains case studies of some who are involved in these various groups.  If  you want a good overview of satanism, read this book.	2000-07-30

For the first few chapters it was, but most of the rest of it are flashbacks to when the main character began his career in the Marines.  Ultimately, it read like a  long-winded biographical sketch.

I had heard that Susan Atkins had gotten saved, but I wanted to know the circumstances from her directly because many Christians tend to take a  report of salvation of someone famous at face value, when in fact, there  was no such conversion.  I enjoyed Susan's very candid account of her life  and the interesting way that she came to know the Lord.  I was somewhat  skeptical of her account of the Sharon Tate murder (she claims she didn't  actually kill Tate), and in reality only the Lord will know what really  happened there.  It appears that she has been genuinely saved, as she has  borne much spiritual fruit in her 25 year ministry to youth and others.  I  recommend this book to anyone who is searching for real truth.	2000-07-03

The idea of having a planet that's inhabited by apes where humans are the animals is indeed an interesting plot.  The problem with the  book is that while the plot is interesting, the way the story is told is  not.

Mulligan's book is interesting because he give the reader a &quot;play by play&quot; account  of a day in the life of a prisoner from his capture in 1966 to his release  in 1973.  One of the things I appreciated about the book was his faith.  He  kept referring to the Lord Christ and the fact that he prayed to Him  several times daily for strength.  As a Christian, I found this a great  testimony.  The story was told fairly as well, for Mulligan not only tells  the reader of the evil things that the animalistic North Vietnamese did,  but also the compassion (genuine, not propaganda) that some of the NVA  soldiers showed him.  This book will put the reader's own life in  perspective.  The small things we go through pale in comparison to what  Captain Mulligan went through.  He is truly an inspiration to me.	2000-06-19

It has the characteristics of a quality fiction novel, yet this story is true.  The author brings the reader into the story  by giving the name, rank, age, and place of birth of many of the  characters.  This makes the ordeal of the men a personal experience for the  reader.

It had plenty of action, but with the action, there was realism.  It did not possess the fake &quot;blood n guts&quot; action of most Vietnam  novels, but it gave a realistic picture of the kind of combat that went on  there.  Durden dealt with many facets of the Vietnam experience, including  the emotions felt by the lead character, Hawkins, and some of the other  characters.

His personal experience is moving, and the documents contained in the book make it even more interesting.  What a tragedy these  deaths were, but by reading this book, one gets a profile of the type of  person who is susceptible to this kind of sick cult.	2000-05-01

The reader knows that someone's after Bolan, yet they don't know who.  The action in the book is outstanding, and the suspense keeps the reader turning pages.	2000-05-01

While it is more faithful to the text than its predecessor, there are areas where the translators speculate regarding the true text.  This is fine on occasion, but there are  areas where the NLT actually stretches the text.  For instance, in the  narrative of Jacob and Leah, Leah's biggest fault was that she had  &quot;pretty eyes.&quot;  While the meaning of this phrase is difficult in  Hebrew, the meaning is clearly NOT the one set forth in the NLT.  On the  whole, it tends to be faithful to the Greek and Hebrew while being easy to  read.  Would recommend this for those unfamiliar with the Bible.	2000-04-27

US	51079787	RN9YLJ9UGYFFJ	0310365007	691248738	The Expositor's Bible commentary : Matthew, Mark, Luke, with the New international version of the Holy Bible (Expositor's Bible commentary, Vol.8)	Books	3	2	6	N	N	Scholarship diminished by poor format	This commentary possesses much good information.  It is exigetical and interesting, and is of great help to the student of the Bible.  The single flaw in it, however, is the format.  This commentary uses much  parenthetical notation, sometimes lasting for several lines.  This makes  for difficult reading.  One does not know where the commentary ends and the  notation begins.  In addition, the reader is forced to hop from  parenthetical notes to footnotes and back again.  The format makes reading  difficult, but the content is excellent.	2000-04-21

Having been born in the Detroit area, I find his references to places I know refreshing.  His gift for holding the reader's attention is superb, and this book especially demonstrates that  talent.  The story line is unique, and the twists and turns in the plot are  surprising.  This was a very good read.	2000-04-21

The plot was interesting, but there  were elements in the book which made it hard to follow. One didn't know if  these were taking place or not.  It was as if Kienzle was trying to put in  a book what you'd see in a television murder mystery.	2000-04-21

His constant mishaps nearly make the reader laugh out loud.  A very good book.	2000-04-21
US	51079787	R1O3TC5QW7Y45D	0345366212	538617097	Chameleon	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great story	This book contains the plot line common in many of Kienzle's books:  the murderer has something against the clergy.  The story was unique in that the killer goes after prostitutes.  One would not expect that in a Catholic  novel, but it's a great suspenseful story.	2000-04-21

From the very start, you're engrossed in the novel, trying to guess whodunit.  The ending is surprising, and as always, I enjoy Kienzle's references to the Detroit area  of which I'm familiar.	2000-04-21

Howard Marshall's commentary on the Epistles of John has much to commend it to the pastor, Bible teacher, or scholar.  His treatment of the passages is thorough, and his text critical footnotes are helpful.  The  only problem with the commentary is the bit of fluff that it contains.   Marshall tends to interject his scholarship with things like old hymn  lyrics, which the reader may not find helpful, yet this book is highly  recommended based on both scholarship and readability.	2000-04-12
