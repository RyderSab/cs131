US	52862683	R1X72XI2KYKP6E	1400033764	398634354	The Swallows of Kabul	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Wrote about things I couldn't relate to in a very accessible way	Ever since I watched the movie The Exorcist, I've been very fascinated by pacing in both movies and books.  This book has very interesting pacing.  The first chapter explodes with a stoning of a prostitute and introduces the jailer and one of the people who did the stoning.  The book then calms down, introduces a few more characters, and then builds and builds until the climax.<br /><br />This reminded me a lot more of a short story than it did of a novel, even though it's 200 pages long.  The story is very tight, and just like when I've read a really good short story, I felt like I didn't get all of the intricacies in the story.<br /><br />This book is translated from French, and I think that the translator used much bigger words than were really needed, but it surprisingly didn't take away too much from the book.  Besides the vocabulary, the translation was very good.<br /><br />I also think this is an interesting story regardless of the setting.  I don't know much about politics or current events, but was still very intrigued by the whole story.<br /><br />This story is a tragedy.  I love tragedies, and that's what fascinated me most about this book.	2005-10-12

The reason for the three stars--it's obvious that this is the author's first book.

It also tells you more of what not to do rather than what to do.<br /><br />But, as I've been thinking about it for the last week since I finished the book, I've realized why this book is so good.

US	52862683	R18LJUE3EI0TNI	015602943X	798265328	The Time Traveler's Wife	Books	5	9	11	N	Y	A sappy romance cleverly disguised as well-written science fiction	This is the closest thing to a trashy romance novel I have ever read.  However, I've read a lot of science fiction, and this is one of the best, most solid, science fiction books I have ever read.<br /><br />I love time travel concepts, and I digest everything I can on the topic.  An interesting contrast to this book is the movie \\"Butterfly Effect.\\"  I enjoyed that movie, but the movie was full of holes, and the consistency of the time travel didn't make sense in places.  This book contrasts to that movie because this book is rock solid.  I know time travel is fantastic, but the author plays very consistently within the \\"world\\" she creates in this book.  So, given that the author's premise actually could happen, she expertly and soundly crafts her story within a very consistent science fiction premise.<br /><br />I also really like that this book was written by a woman.  I think with this book, Audrey Niffenegger proves women can write science fiction better than men.<br /><br />This is probably the most accessible science fiction book I have ever read.  At my book club where we discussed this book, most of the women didn't like it, but they said as far as science fiction, it was probably the most likeable of a science fiction book they could think of.<br /><br />There are tons of ways to look at this book.  It seems like everyone I've talked to about this has picked up different things from it.  One person said she really liked how this book talks about soul mates.  One person said it reminded her of what Alzheimer's patients go through when they live in the past.  I really felt it gave a message of hope in a situation of finality.<br /><br />I've usually been disappointed in \\"best sellers,\\" but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I loved the language in this book.  She uses very interesting language and has a very fun vocabulary.  I'm not a dog ear-er, but I dog eared about five pages where I loved the way she described things.  My favorite quote from the book is this: \\"And Noah was a weird old man with a houseboat and a lot of cats.\\"<br /><br />Henry reminded me a lot of myself.  He's cold.  He does what he needs to do to survive.<br /><br />I cried when I read this book, and I don't know if a book has moved me that much before.  I feel embarrassed saying that, but I count the 20.3 million amazon customers among my closest friends, so I'll confide I not only cried, but I wept.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, and I'm not sure if I could give anything away if I wanted to because this book is so hard to describe.  I don't think you could describe it in fewer words than the author used to write it.<br /><br />But, there are situations that happened in this book, because of the time travel theme, that evoke unique emotions.  Just one example is how Henry is able to get to know his mom as an adult (from observing her from a distance) even though he didn't know her very well, because she died when he was young.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone.book is this: \\"And Noah was a weird old man with a houseboat and a lot of cats.\\" <br /> <br />Henry reminded me a lot of myself.

As he nears completion of his research, the government becomes interested in it.  Alec finishes his formula, and it works exactly the way that he had intended.  He's about to use it to grow plants in the desert when the government steals it from him, and uses it to make a bomb, to destroy the desert country that Alec was trying to save by growing his plants.<br /><br />Deborah Tannen is that scientist.<br /><br />Her research is pure...her research is good.  However, this book could be used for any purpose.  It could be used to bring a husband and wife much closer together.  It also could be used in the most horrific ways to manipulate both men and women.<br /><br />This book explains everything.  It explains why men won't stop and ask for directions, and more importantly, why women want them to.  It explains why women get jealous that their husbands talk to people in groups, but then their husbands won't talk to them when they are alone.<br /><br />And, it kept explaining things....I can't think of any common male-female difference that this book didn't explain and have a model for why.<br /><br />Also, I felt a little gay when I was reading this book, because I thought.... \\"These are things that I'm really not supposed to know.\\"  I feel like I had learned too much, like I had stumbled into a temple that held the keys to the secrets of the universe, but that I was not ready for it.<br /><br />And, it's more slanted toward women than toward men.  That's okay, but I think that half of the all of the copies of this book that sell have been sold to women.  And the other half of the copies of this book that sell are sold to those same women who then give them as gifts to their male friends, who end up shelving the book.  I ran into three guys so far who had been given this book as gifts, but who haven't opened it.<br /><br />This book has more content in five pages of it than many books have in all of their pages.  Even if I hated this book, I would have to give it five stars, because it's got so much good research in it.<br /><br />But, I loved this book, and so I'm giving it a very enthusiastic five stars.so far who had been given this book as gifts, but who haven't opened it. <br /> <br />This book has more content in five pages of it than many books have in all of their pages.

In my job at work, I'm helping to increase our inventory accuracy, and it gives a lot of extremely good information.<br /><br />Why did this hold up so well?  Mostly because the authors talked about the timeless principles of warehousing, such as minimizing distance traveled with the forklift, theories about where to put high moving versus slow moving items, and theories about size and type of storage space for type of inventory stored.  In \\"cutting edge\\" places of warehousing such as automatic picking and barcoding, they give a basic explanation, but also explain that future technologies would make any further discussion obsolete.  As it is, all of the discussion is very relevant.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend this book to anyone who is working in a warehouse, or who needs to know more about warehousing.  It is very easily accessible, and has a lot of very good information.	2005-07-14

I finished this book about three weeks ago, and this book has stayed with me ever since.  It's probably too soon to say this, but this is one of the two best books I've ever read.<br /><br />The way that I read this book is that I read each story twice--After I finished a story, I started it again.  They say that if a short story is a good one, then the second time through will be better than the first and this was the case for every one of his these stories.  I recommend this approach of reading them twice to everyone.  These stories are so good and have so much in them that if you've only read them once then you'll miss so much.<br /><br />The two hardest types of writing are the short story and the play.  It's very interesting that Labute crosses over into the other hardest type of writing, and makes something this incredible.<br /><br />While I was reading this, I thought, \\"Labute is just showing off here.\\"  Showcasing, I think is what they call it in sports.  For me, it was kind of like being able to rewind time and see the greatest moves of Michael Jordan.  It reminds me of the dirty joke about the dog, which has the punch line of \\"Because he can.\\"  And, I wonder why Labute writes this stuff and writes it so well.  Is it simply because he can?<br /><br />This book also allayed my fear about Labute, which is that he's eventually going to run out of material.  I've read most of his plays now, and I've been kind of afraid that he would eventually run out of material because some of the themes are starting to cross.  I now realize that as long as darkness lurks in the hearts of men, that Labute will never run out of material.<br /><br />These stories are haunting and dark.  Some of them are so horrific that I would be unable to describe to a friend what they are even about.  Somebody said that one story in particular left him in the fetal position, and for the life of me, I'm not sure which one that would be, because about half of these stories did that to me.<br /><br />Some of these stories have a surprise twist, and some of them don't.  I found it really interesting how they were mixed up.  And if you think the point is just the twist, read it again.  These stories are much more complex than just mysteries.<br /><br />And, I love the title of this book.  It begs the question of \\"What lengths will people go to for only seconds of pleasure?\\"  It's a very multi-faceted title also, because it's a lot more than just that question--one of the stories is called \\"A Second of Pleasure,\\" and gives a different take on the title.<br /><br />If I ever meet Labute, I'm going to ask him these questions: \\"Where did you meet these people?\\" \\"How did you get to know them so well?\\"  He's clearly going above and beyond just writing from his own experience here.  These people are so amazingly different and he brings them to life.  I know these aren't real people, but they seem so real in this book.<br /><br />If anyone who is reading this didn't like any of the stories, then go back and read the one you didn't like just one more time...you'll appreciate it more, I guarantee it.  This, of course, doesn't apply, if you didn't like it simply for the subject matter, which, like I said, is haunting.to me. <br /> <br />Some of these stories have a surprise twist, and some of them don't.

It's basically that to get into a movie, you suspend your disbelief as you watch amazing things happen.  This usually works unless you have something that is just to amazing, or too inconsistent with the rest of the movie, that breaks you out of your suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />That's what happened when I read this book.  I kept getting reminded: JOSEPH, YOU'RE READING A BOOK.  The biggest way this happened is with the point of view of the author.  It's in first person, but I was unable to tell if it was supposed to be from the 14-year old girl, or if it was supposed to be from someone the author's age reminiscing.  Again, the reminder...A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL IS NOT WRITING THIS STUFF.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the book.  It's got a lot of cool stuff, a cool premise, and intriguing adventure, etc., etc.  But...<br /><br />The worst and most glaring parts were how the author tackled the racism issue.  The main character bounced back and forth from being caring and sensitve to being cold and oblivious to racist issues.  It was done in a very jarring way.  Again, I was reminded...THESE BLACK PEOPLE AND THIS WHITE GIRL AND THE ISSUES THEY HAVE ARE NOT REAL.<br /><br />I have a friend who said that a black friend of his thought that the book made black people look stupid.  I'm not going to argue that, but I do think that the main reason it did is because of the poor writing.<br /><br />Also, the author used two tactics of very begining authors...\\"The whole premise is based on a lie,\\" which when the truth comes out, everything is better and gets resolved, and \\"Meta medium\\" which is that the book is about an aspiring author.<br /><br />I feel bad for the author.  After she finished her book, she must have realized that it had all of the glaring flaws that I mentioned, but these flaws are so tightly interwoven into the fabric of her book that it would have been impossible to surgically remove them.  It must have been depressing to realize that she couldn't fix the mess that she made.  Kind of like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar.  Oh well, at least she made a lot of money on it.to surgically remove them.  It must have been depressing to realize that she couldn't fix the mess that she made.

There are actually only a few concepts taken from this book that made it into the movie--a) that the iron giant can fix himself, b) that the boy's name is Hogarth, and c) that the iron giant eats metal.  Nothing else is the same, really.<br /><br />Brad Bird is a genius to make the movie he did out of this book.<br /><br />I didn't realize this, but the book was written in 1968.  It's very much in children's book format, with small, chunk-sized stories, that would be very fun to read out loud.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this book.	2005-06-21
US	52862683	R2AFFU5TJZP502	0939246422	725101759	World Class Manufacturing	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Very good snapshot of 1994	This book is basically about all of the buzzwords or TLA's (Three Letter Acronyms) of 1994.  I found it a very fascinating book.<br /><br />This book is a compilation of about fourty different authors, each of which write a different chapter on a different aspect of manufacturing.<br /><br />A lot of the chapters focus on the buzzwords of the time, like JIT, TQM, QFD, ISO 9000, and SQM.  I found it really interesting to see what had changed and what had stayed the same.  I have the following observations: 1) That all of the government based programs (ISO, Malcom Baldridge awards) are still around, 2) That everything that has a pattented, proprietary chart or graph is gone (QFD, NewComp), 3) That everything that claims to be everything to everyone is still around (JIT, TQM, Benchmarking, ERP), 4) That the biggest difference between now and then is that computers have allowed connecting the supply chain further (This book talks about the ability to connect to your suppliers, and then talks in a separate section about how to connect to your customers.  Modern books push the Customer of Customer and Supplier of Supplier concept).<br /><br />It was really interesting, because things were a lot simpler, as far as supply chain back then, so I recommend reading this to everyone to get a good idea of the basics.  A lot of the newer books that I've found delve right into complex concepts like the Advanced Supply Chain Model that connects everyone to everyone else.  Where do you start learning in a model like that?<br /><br />The funny thing is that every chapter was extremely interesting, except the one written by the compiler, Thomas Wallace.  His chapter was really boring.  The guy can compile, but he can't write.  But the other 39 chapters are great.<br /><br />I really, really liked the format of the book.  Each chapter is set up in the same format with 1) the body of what the book is about, 2) definitions of key words, 3) Q&A, and 4) chapter summary.  Probably the definitions were the most interesting part because they didn't just repeat parts of the body of the text, but they provided a lot of additional information.  Whoever came up with the format of this book was a genius, and really should roll it out to more books.the definitions were the most interesting part because they didn't just repeat parts of the body of the text, but they provided a lot of additional information.

All of these media have matured, in that there are the best books, the best speeches, and the best art already available.<br /><br />Music, graphic novels, and movies would be the next level of complexity in that they combine two forms of media.  Music is the only one of these media that has fully matured, in that there is lots of music out there that is better than the best in either vocals or poetry.  There have been a few movies that have transcended the separate media of photographs and literature, but really not very many.  Movies is still a relatively new media, and I think that in about 20 years you will see lots of movies that are better than either of the components of photographs or literature.<br /><br />Which brings me to this book--this book is a land breaking book in that it finally pushed graphic novels past the point that either books or art can achieve on their own.  Craig Thompson has finally brought the medium of graphic novels \\"into its own.\\"<br /><br />And, then the Internet and \\"TV of the future\\" would be ultra-complex media.  My guess is that it's about 100 years from now before anyone makes a website that's better than a good book.<br /><br />This story made me cry.  Every chapter made me cry.  I read it a chapter at a time, and savored it.  I recommend that, because there is so much in this book.<br /><br />If you're looking to be surprised by a book, read another one.  I could tell the ending from the first chapter or two, but it didn't matter.  The strength of this book is in the emotions it evokes.<br /><br />This book did something really cool toward the middle--it portrayed perfection.  Everything was perfect for just about 10 pages.  I don't know how Craig Thompson did it, but he created something in this book that is larger than life, that is tangible, and that will probably stick with me forever.<br /><br />Maybe in a few years after I've read this book five more times, I'll figure out the magic of it and post another review and explain it all.  But, for now all I can say is that I'm awed by how perfect this book is.<br /><br />Also, this book isn't a teenage love story.  It's a story about childhood memories.  It has the phantasmagoric effect of remembering.  I loved it.ges.

I'm reading all of the Sin City books, and I just finished this one.<br /><br />I'm totally amazed at how closely the movie follows the book, and yet there were subtle differences that make the movie better, and the book more interesting to read.

This was a hard book to trudge through, probably because of its very narrow target audience.<br /><br />This book is written to the level of Senior Vice President of International Operations at a $800+ million company.  It's at a pretty high level and maybe that's why it was so hard to read.<br /><br />With only a few minor modifications, this book could be called: \\"World Class Marketing\\" or \\"Quality Improvement: New Directions.\\"  It's technically about Supply Chain Management, but it's at such a very high level.	2005-05-26

He talks about all of the mechanics of public speaking, but something big is missing from this book.  Also, leadership via public speaking, which seems to be the titular topic of this book, is missing from the pages.<br /><br />Mr. Pearce reminds me of one of my statistics professors.  This professor, which I'll call Mr. Banal, was a very smart person, had studied a lot, was up on the current statistics methodologies, and was a nice person.  However, Mr. Banal's lecture consisted almost entirely of an analysis of what he thought of the textbook.  Mr. Banal always had some new \\"insight\\"--which usually amounted to a very minor disagreement that he had with the author of the text.  He talked about this minor disagreement for the entire lecture hour.  I think that doing this allowed him to feel good about himself, because he was proving to the students that he was smarter than the author of the text.<br /><br />This was really confusing to me.  Who should I believe, Mr. Banal or the author of the statistics text?  The author seemed a lot more interesting (which is funny considering the subject), but Mr. Banal was the one who ultimately would be testing me.<br /><br />This is what Mr. Pearce does in his book.  He is constantly rewriting speeches of others into a \\"better speech.\\"  A really funny example of this occurs during the end of the book, where he's quoting Anita Roddick, managing director of The Body Shop International.  Roddick is an excellent public speaker, and he quotes often from one of her speeches, which is probably the most interesting part of the book.  Toward the end, Mr. Pearce cherry picks a paragraph from her speech and reworks it.  The initial paragraph wasn't all that bad, but Mr. Pearce's \\"improved\\" version of it was terrible.<br /><br />This is the same kind of difference between a sports commentator and an avid fan.  The sports commentator will describe the athlete, what the athlete did during the performance, and trace the effects of the athlete's performance.  This is very complex and requires a lot of skill.<br /><br />The avid fan will say things like, \\"I would have done this...I would have done that.\\"  This requires very little skill at all.<br /><br />Mr. Pearce is the avid fan, telling us what he would have done, rather than actually doing anything himself.<br /><br />It kind of seems like Mr. Pearce was writing this book for the dean of UC-Berkeley, rather than for the public.improved\\" version of it was terrible. <br /> <br />This is the same kind of difference between a sports commentator and an avid fan.

I've been working with my trainer at the gym to help my posture, and this book really helped me to understand some of the underlying concepts of posture.<br /><br />This book is written to women, and I am a man, but I thought that this was actually a very good idea.  There are a couple of references to \\"men should do this instead,\\" when they are needed, but I thought that focusing on one gender made the book very clear and very understandable.<br /><br />Which reminds me of the coolest thing about this book, which is the illustrations.  All of the illustrations are of the same woman.  And this is very cool, because I was able to tell really quickly what good posture was and what was not.  By focusing just on women, and by focusing just on one person giving examples of good posture and bad posture, it made the book very understandable.<br /><br />Also, Janice Novak gives the meat of the book in the first ten pages, where she talks about her \\"One minute to better posture\\" exercise.  This is a really cool exercise that will transform your life instantly.  It's really cool, because the book starts out with a real bang and then the rest of the book supports that initial bang until the end.<br /><br />The only improvement that I would suggest for the next edition is to have pictures of all of the exercises, and have two pictures for the two-step exercises.  This would increase the size of the book by about twenty pages, but I think it would be worth it.  I can be slow sometimes and pictures help me a lot.	2005-05-23
US	52862683	RA957F07PR9H3	0836280008	794880790	I Can See You Naked	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Doesn't talk much about nakedness or nudity	The title of this book is funny.  Ron Hoff actually only mentions it in the first three pages of the book, where he says that he actually tried picturing the audiences naked three times, and it was so distracting to him that he had to stop.  The rest of the book goes from subject to subject on public speaking.<br /><br />I can tell that Ron is an excellent public speaker just through reading this book.  He speaks from years of experience, and it works well.  He's also an excellent book writer.  I really like how this book covered all of the topics that you can think of on public speaking.  Each chapter usually has a list of things to think about or things to work on.<br /><br />It was written in the 80's, so some of the references are dated, but it's really interesting how all of it really applies to today.  And, this book is salted with just the right amount of illustrations.<br /><br />I learned so much about public speaking by reading this book. I've read four books on public speaking, and this one is by far the best.  I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />I did get some funny looks when I was reading the book in public places, probably becasue \\"Naked\\" is emblazoned on the cover, and there are illustrations of a lot of naked people on the cover.  But the knowledge I got was well worth any funny looks.	2005-05-22

Marv was my favorite movie story.  I was really sad to see him die in the first book.<br /><br />But, this book is really cool, because it takes place about the same time as Book 1, chronologically, and Marv is in this story a lot.  This story is the first story with Dwight in it, back before he got his facelift.<br /><br />I was also relieved that they didn't cherry pick the best story lines for Sin City 1, the movie.  This story is every bit as well written as the other stories.<br /><br />There's a lot more nudity in this book than the first one, and the book is printed entirely in black and white.	2005-05-19

I loved the dialogue, I loved the tension, and I loved how Labute builds and build--how well-crafted his plays are.<br /><br />I really don't want to give away much of the story.  So, all I'll say is that in the first few pages the main character comes back into his childhood town, happens to meet a girl that he knew 12 years ago, flirts with her, and decides to rent a room from her and her husband.<br /><br />This play uses the N word a few times.  And, as with all of Labute's plays, I recommend that you read the introduction after you've read the play.	2005-05-16

It's really worth another read, keeping one or more of the following topics in mind.<br /><br />Topic #1: A woman's struggle with bulimia<br /><br />Signs of this first topic permeate the first half of the book.  I hesitate to bring this up, because I know that morning sickness, especially severe morning sickness is real.  However, there are cues to that this is not just morning sickness, and it's not just the unusually violent morning sickness because of her autoimmune disorder. It's something more.  Like many people with bulimia, Martha hates her bulimia.  She would love to talk about it, but she needs to keep it guarded.  During her descriptions of throwing up, it becomes obvious that she's been wanting to talk about throwing up for quite a while, but that the only way she can \\"safely\\" do so is to mask her bulimia behind her morning sickness.<br /><br />Topic #2: A wife's denial that she is in love with a gay man<br /><br />John is made out to be a manly man--an artificially manly man.  In fact, whenever he can be talked about as manly, he is described as manly.  Why does she have this need to make him into being so manly?  Also, a pervasive theme throughout this book is how connected they are, how they are soul mates.  This is all done in a very artificial way.  Martha seems to be trying to convince herself way too hard that John loves her in a straight way.<br /><br />Topic #3: How mean spiritedness can sometimes help people to cope<br /><br />It's interesting how this book has been rated so high, and Martha's subsequent book has been rated so low.  Both use the technique of mean spiritedness.  However, I think that the difference is who the mean spiritedness is directed at.<br /><br />In this book the mean spiritedness is directed at a) Stuffy Harvard intellectuals, who push people too hard academically, b) People with prejudice toward people with disabilities, and c) People who viscously advocate a \\"abortion at all costs\\" attitude toward children.  These are all socially accepted people to be mean spirited towards.<br /><br />In her next book, the mean spiritedness is directed at a) her dying 90-year-old father, and b) devout religious people.  Devout religious people is an iffy topic to be mean spirited toward, but being mean spirited toward your dying 90-year-old father is always taboo.<br /><br />It's fascinating how this book does a pretty good job at masking her mean spiritedness, because of whom the mean spiritedness is targeted to.<br /><br />I know that a lot of people use the coping mechanism of being mean after the fact when the people who hurt them are no longer there.  However, I think there are much better ways of dealing with underlying problems.<br /><br />Topic #4: How some people \\"sensitively\\" treat people with disabilities as animals<br /><br />I've noticed that the people I know who have members of their families with disabilities fall into three categories: a) that they treat their family members as equals, b) that they treat their family members as \\"special\\" or animals, that they can condescendingly \\"learn\\" from, and c) that they really don't like their family members, and they ignore or shun them.  I think that of the people I know, that 80% fall into the first category, 10% fall into the second, and 10% fall into the third.<br /><br />Martha Beck falls into the second category.  Adam is not an equal.  He is someone to condescendingly \\"learn\\" from.  I was thinking this all the way through the book, and I was surprised when Marthaconfirmed this by literally comparing Adam to a pet cat in the last 20 pages.<br /><br />I was sad about this.  I know a lot of people who are in the first category, who aren't condescending to their family members with disabilities.  It's too bad that more of those people don't write books about their stories.<br /><br />Topic #5: Hypochondria doesn't even do this topic justice<br /><br />The author mentions every time that John was sick in the seven years chronicled by this book.  The author mentions about ten different diseases or disorders that she has, none of which is bulimia or mental illness, which I could believe.  I could believe that she has an occasional disorder or two, but ten is a bit much to be believable.<br /><br />Topic #6: How an extremely religious upbringing can leave someone soulless<br /><br />This topic fascinates me.  Martha grew up in a regimented, religious environment.  She tried to escape it by going atheist for a while, and then was ultimately pulled back fiercely, and became a lot more of a \\"religious crazy\\" than she ever was before.<br /><br />This kind of thing happens all of the time.  Look at any religious fanatic that you have ever met, and they have the same story...a) Extremely strict and kind of weird religious upbringing, b) an attempt to escape and an attempt to turn their backs without ever dealing with the issues that their upbringing caused, and c) the metamorphosis into being a prophet-like figure, by figuring out some new truths above and beyond what the religious dogma of their youth taught, and d) a need to share these new truths with others.<br /><br />This is Martha's story to a T.<br /><br />And, the fascinating thing is that this cycle leaves a person without a heart and without a soul, and totally fixated on their new religious truths.<br /><br />Topic #7: A chronicle of one person's descent into mental illness<br /><br />Usually, if someone has a supernatural \\"gift,\\" then it would get exhibited in one or two ways.  Martha has about twenty distinctly different supernatural \\"gifts.\\"  I think that Superman only has about 15, and those are the fictional products of over 100 writers over the last 70 years.<br /><br />I think that one supernatural gift is believable.  Two to three are questionable, and four or more indicate mental illness.  Martha has twenty.<br /><br />The fascinating thing for me was trying to figure out what was actually real.ok, and I was surprised when Martha confirmed this by literally comparing Adam to a pet cat in the last 20 pages. <br /> <br />I was sad about this.

US	52862683	R2F0RSDMTBJNXV	0679761063	255646884	The Master of Go	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Reads like a collection of newspaper columns	I'm giving this book five stars because it's one of only three fiction books available with go as the theme, and I love the game of go.<br /><br />But, this book reads like a collection of newspaper columns.  You can literally rip any chapter out of the book and not lose any continuity.  Each chapter is on a different subject, starts with a different chronology, and has a different point.  For example, one chapter is about the long hair on the Go Master's eyebrow, and starts when he was still alive, and ends with some post-mortem photographs.  Another example, one chapter talks about the Go Master's competitor's wife, and how years ago she was very pretty, but now she's a lot more weathered but she still has hints of prettiness, and how she's supportive of her husband throughout the tournament and raises their kids.  Like I said, rip these out, and you really don't lose much.<br /><br />It also movie-ifies the Go Master and his competitor.  It makes the Go Master out to be the nice guy, and his competitor out to be the bad guy, with no good qualities at all.  I'm sure that the actual go match wasn't as dramatic and lively as this book makes it sounds.<br /><br />But, it does do an excellent job of portraying all of the excitement an everything that goes through the head of a very skilled person involved in a board game.  I remember playing games of chess or go and it seemed really exciting to me, but afterwards when I tried to explain how exciting the game was, other people would just look at me with a blank stare.  This book does a good job describing that feeling in an explainable way.<br /><br />I'm a go player, so I understood a lot of the go references.  If you haven't ever played go before, it might be pretty hard to understand, especially because go is different than any other game that I've ever played.  But, here's an intro course.  White 100 means the 100th move, and Black 101 will be the next move, the 101st move.  This is the way to tell chronology in the book.  Go is very interesting, in that the first 50 moves, or the beginning game, aren't very complex, and so they go fast.  The next 100 moves, or the middle game, are extremely complex, and the final 50-100 moves, or the end game, are very simple.  Usually the game is decided in the middle game, and the end game is just kind of a formality.<br /><br />That dynamic is totally different than any other game, and so what that means to the non-go player is that none of the charts or graphs of the go moves will make any sense, because the book talks about the middle game, which is so vague and nebulous to an onlooker.  At least in chess, an onlooker can say \\"who captured more pieces\\" and get a good idea for who is winning.  There's no way for an onlooker to ask a simple question to go players to determine who is winning.<br /><br />It's an excellent book to read for a cultural experience, since it's written by a Japanese author about a go game in 1938.  I especially thought the chapter on the American visiting Japan was funny.<br /><br />Also, the first part of the book makes it sound like the Go Master's final go game was responsible for the Go Master's death.  I think that's just the author dramatizing it.  In one of the later chapters I found out he died about a year later.  Plus this Go Master dude was like 70 lbs, 85 years old, and just sat around in an old folk's home playing games all day.  People like that die all the time.<br /><br />All in all, worth reading, but I do hope that more people write books on the game of go, because I love the game of go.ology in the book.

Actually, this is THE course.  This book reads like the script of a self improvement course.<br /><br />And, it's sad, because I would have loved to take this course.  I think that the actual course is well worth however much he's charging for it.<br /><br />However, Walter's course doesn't translate well to a book format.  Every couple of pages it has an activity that would work well in a classroom, but fails miserably in a book.  You're supposed to do all of these activities where you write stuff out on papers and wait a week while you try stuff.  Since I just wanted to read the book, those were kind of annoying.<br /><br />That's sad, too, because I would have loved to read an actual book by Walter Anderson on this subject rather than a script of a course.  He should have an editor totally rearrange this into book format, and then re-release it.<br /><br />It's got excellent content, and the content was exactly what I was looking for--how to re-program your brain, the negative power of \\"no\\" statements, tips on telling stories, and tips on giving speeches.  But, the presentation of the content is poor.<br /><br />And, I don't mind blatant self promotion of purchasing additional stuff in a book as long as the book has actual content.  This book does deliver of both the blatant self promotion and the actual content.	2005-05-02

The part I liked best about Labute's \\"Your Friends and Neighbors\\" was the arguing between Ben Stiller and Catherine Keener.  That argument only lasted for about five minutes, so the fact that Mercy Seat is an hour-long argument is treat for someone like me.<br /><br />This play has only two characters, and it is extremely fascinating and extremely complex.  Ben Harcourt is Labute's typical Aaron Eckhart character.  But I think that Abby Prescott's character type is new for Labute.  She's a very smart, and seemingly genuine and nice woman.<br /><br />Labute says in the introduction that this is his first play solely about relationships.  He does an excellent job.  My only recommendation is to skip Labute's introduction to the play until you've read it through once.  It's an extremely cool intro, but I feel that it gives away too much of the plot.	2005-04-29
US	52862683	RQE7WDQW3VKW5	0843128682	592384036	Being Happy!	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	A surprisingly excellent book	I finished Being Happy this afternoon, and I've been trying to figure out why it made such an impact on me.<br /><br />It's filled with motivational stories that everyone has heard before, like about Edison failing 1000 times before he succeeded, how we can learn imagination from children, and how the people who thought about free throws improved just as much as the people who practiced.  I've heard all those stories before, so the greatness of the book isn't that.<br /><br />Maybe it's the organization of the book.  The book is organized into five chapters: Patterns, Live Now!, Toward the Direction of Our Dominant Thoughts, Goals, and Nature.  I thought this was a very good analysis of the components of happiness.<br /><br />Maybe it's the author's command of the subject material.  I could tell that the author really enjoyed being happy and that he's a good example of how to be happy.  He also presents the material without being preachy, without being self-aggrandizing, or without making too much of a sales pitch for his training company. (He does have a training company, but the book only references it once.)<br /><br />So, I think I'll continue to be perplexed for a while about why I liked this book so much.  All I know is it made a positive impact on me, and I feel happier and more confident after reading it.	2005-04-27

It only has the first three comics of the 60-issue series of Transmetropolitan, but I actually really liked that.  The first three issues really get you involved in the story--after I finished this first book, I decided to read the entire series.<br /><br />Transmetropolitan is centered around Spider Jerusalem, a journalist.  He practices \\"gonzo\\" journalism, and I had to look it up...it is \\"a style of first-person reporting where the usually-anonymous reporter becomes a central character in the story, a conduit of subjectivity.\\"<br /><br />What that means basically is that the journalist is in the middle of the story, isn't objective, and can affect the outcome of the story.  Something that reflects his style is Spider's saying: \\"The Truth, no matter what\\"<br /><br />So, if you're a journalist, you'll probably love this series.  It overglorifies journalism.  I'm not a journalist, and I still love it.  I think it would appeal to anyone who likes comics \\"for mature readers.\\"<br /><br />And, the first issue is really cool where Spider has Weird Al hair.	2005-04-27

And, as soon as you read Volume 1, then you'll get this, because Transmetropolitan is an extremely interesting dystopian view of a disturbing, yet compelling future.<br /><br />I really like how Transmetropolitan is set in the future, but it just jumps into the story.  There isn't any reference to \\"...300 years from now, when the government is more corrupt and etc...etc.\\"  It just jumps in and tells the story.  This book extremely well written and is all about a good story.<br /><br />I just finished Volume 2 last night, and I ordered the next two volumes today.  It comprises issues 7 - 12 of the 60-issue series, so you get a lot of comics in this graphic novel.  I really liked how it seems to do a lot of setup and characterization for the story to come.<br /><br />I thought it was really cool where in the future, they've invented cancer suppressants for smokers so that you can smoke all that you want to without getting sick.  Not that smoking's cool, I just think it's cool that there are options.

I like how the book breaks each chapter into three sections: 1) how you can organize yourself, 2) how you can work with family and friends to be organized, and 3) how you can pay professionals to help you organize.<br /><br />The book is written in really large type, so I kind of felt like I was reading a \\"stupid book,\\" but it was pretty easy to read, and reading can be kind of tough for me sometimes.<br /><br />And, the book gives a bunch of different examples for a bunch of different ADD situations.  I thought that was helpful, because there is no one ADD mold that fits everyone.  So, some chapters I identified with, and some I didn't.  It's really written in a pick and choose format, so I was able to use what helped me and leave what I didn't identify with.	2005-04-23

In this play Labute writes about the type of situations that you'd see on Jerry Springer, so this is a kind of \\"Labute does Jerry Springer.\\"  I may be an oddity, but I like Springer.  I also like Labute, so this is a great play for the likes of me.<br /><br />This play isn't for everyone, but if you've ever read Labute, then you know that nothing he writes is for everyone.  It probably borders on being his darkest play, with frequent use of the f, c, and n words, and has a bunch of other racial slurs in it.<br /><br />I've kind of been wondering about what kind of a person Labute is.  Is he a kind of Stephen King-type person who writes well, but is really a weirdo, or what?  In the book, Labute writes a two-page introduction that contains such humanity, care for people, and emotion, that it answered this question for me--he's is very human, but is extremely observational about the dark side of life.<br /><br />This is one of my top two Labute plays.  Excellent job.	2005-04-23

If there were a few more biographies available, I'd probably only give it two stars.<br /><br />This book reads like a newspaper written by a mediocre journalist.  Or a compilation of a bunch of articles from Us or People.  It's really annoying to read because of that style.<br /><br />But, it does contain a lot of good information.  It answered most of my questions that I had about Ellen.  It doesn't have any direct interviews with Ellen, but I don't think that Ellen is going to say any more about her past than she has.  In one book, Ellen says, \\"I can't remember anything about my childhood.\\"  And, I think that's probably true.  That's probably why she makes a bunch of jokes about everything, because she's got a horrible memory.<br /><br />And, this book is mostly about the TV sitcom, Ellen.  Probably about 75% of it is about the sitcom, and the biography ends after the end of the show.  So, since she's got a talk show, this book is really dated.  And, three of the chapters are dedicated to various co-stars of the TV sitcom, so this book really isn't a 100% Ellen book.<br /><br />So, if you're a huge Ellen fan like me, you will probably want to dredge through this book.  For everyone else, I'd recommend passing on it and waiting for Ellen's next biography to come out in a few years.	2005-04-19

It took about 45 minutes to read, and I read it very slowly.  After I was done, I cursed myself for paying full price for it.  I should have bought it used on amazon.<br /><br />As far as content, it doesn't have anything revolutionary.  It's a good summary of popular sales skills, but it mostly talks about doing everything that you do in one minute.  I guess that concept's cool, but the book really bangs it over your head, like a frying pan.<br /><br />So, it's worth reading once, but please learn from my mistake, and don't pay full price for it.	2005-04-17

In addition to that, Victor is a great salesman, who has made all the mistakes earlier on so he now knows everything.

You'd have to be pretty dumb or very chauvinistic to think it was laugh-out-loud funny.  So, I really hope that the authors were trying to be serious, rather than funny, but like I said, I couldn't tell.<br /><br />I did think it was very informative.  It's worth buying and reading, for both men and women.<br /><br />This describes the \\"ultimate\\" man.  I would describe it as the alpha man, but the \\"ultimate\\" man in this book would choose being a jerk to being dominant.<br /><br />It's worth buying for men, because every man has thought all of the things that are in the book.  Most haven't given in to their \\"ultimate\\" man side, as evidenced by that most men don't sit around fat, in a tank top, unemployed, and gripe at their wife all day.  If you give in to your \\"ultimate\\" man side, then this will happen to you, and this book is a guide for how to accomplish that.<br /><br />So, you probably want to read the book, but you probably don't want to follow it.<br /><br />It's worth reading for women, to tell how men think.  And, I have news for you--every man, including your really nice boyfriend, has these kinds of thoughts going through his head.<br /><br />Another note: a lot of the negative reviews have said that this is a good book to read to get inside the mind of a rapist, or a psychologically messed up stalker-type personality.  I really think that all of those negative reviews were planted by the authors to stir up hype about their book.  If they were trying to write a funny book, that's the kind of thing that these authors would have thought was funny.<br /><br />But, the flaw in that thinking is that this book doesn't describe rapists or stalkers.  Those types are cowards.  This book, like I said, describes the \\"ultimate\\" man, which is much higher on the alpha scale and much lower on the cowardly stalker scale.  It describes a jerk, not a coward.<br /><br />But, after saying that, I don't recommend giving this book to rapists or stalkers, because they probably would think that this book is describing them, and they would continue to do whatever it is that they are doing, but feel more justified in it.

I never would have thought than anyone could blend science fiction and humor.  Actually, this book is more of a humor book with science fiction thrown in.<br /><br />This book follows the travels of Arthur Dent, as the world gets destroyed, and he gets miraculously saved and whisked away into an outer space adventure.<br /><br />I really enjoy Douglas Adam's writing style.  He never takes himself too seriously.  This is much more a story about the journey than the destination.<br /><br />And, if you didn't know, this is British humor.

I read it in about two hours, and I think I read it pretty slowly.<br /><br />You'll like it if you've ever read any of the style sections in Esquire--it's written by an Esquire editor, and it's written in the same type of formal, aloof, and arrogant tone that Esquire is written in.  So, if you've got a question as far as whether or not you'll like it, just thumb through an Esquire at the bookstore.  If you like it, you'll like this...if not, then you won't.<br /><br />Here's an exerpt I liked: \\"For those still contemplating the wearing of funny underwear, think: When you are removing your pants for the viewing pleasure of another, do you really want the person to laugh?\\"<br /><br />It's a really good way to familiarize yourself with the \\"rules\\" of style very, very quickly.  It's not an exhaustive guide that will really teach you anything.<br /><br />And, it's a tad dated.  Boxer briefs are the in thing now, baby!<br /><br />Also, the pictures of the dog are funny.

Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Best for women who are currently dating a gay man	The best thing you can do with this book is to give this as a gift to a friend who is dating a gay man, and who thinks that she isn't.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that it walks through the steps of a gay man/straight woman relationship, and talks about it from the woman's point of view.  It has a section: \\"What the woman is telling herself,\\" that is very informative.<br /><br />I don't think there are any gay men who match up 100% to the checklist that this book ends up being, but like I said, I think that this book is more a tool for coping than for anything else.<br /><br />Technical stuff: This book is written in a comic book format--mostly pictures.  I finished this book in about 10 minutes.  It's pretty small, too.  Only 80 pages.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent buy, especially since they are selling so cheap used on amazon now.	2005-04-15

I've read a few articles, a few chapters in various books that were guest-written by him, and now I've read this book.  I bought this book mostly because it has a very substantive part on cluttering, and I am a clutterer.<br /><br />The revolutionary approach that David Daly has to cluttering is his 33-item test of cluttering, where the SLP rates the clutterer on a scale of 0 to 3 for each item, and then comes up with a grand total.  If the person scores 55 or above, then the person can be given a diagnosis of cluttering.  If it is 35-55, then the diagnosis may be a hybrid of stuttering/cluttering.<br /><br />He's also got a lot of other good information and resources on cluttering in this book.<br /><br />This book is also the only place that I've seen where you can get actual speech samples of clutterers.  This book comes with a 60-minute audiotape.  Only 15 minutes is dedicated to cluttering, but there are 4 different speech samples of cluttering.  Getting those samples alone is worth the price of the tape.<br /><br />And, to be fair, the book is mostly about stuttering, it's like the tape, only 1/4 of it is dedicated to cluttering, but that's much more than most stuttering books dedicate to cluttering.<br /><br />If you haven't heard David Daly's story, then you should read it on his website at stuttertreatment.com.  The really cool thing about his story is that he was a person who stutters, and he always had the goal of being perfectly fluent.  It took him years to make much progress, but he kept trying and trying, and now he's very fluent.  About 50% of the tape is David Daly talking.  That's really inspirational to me, because even though I haven't ever stuttered, I share his goal of being perfectly fluent.  And, I figure that if he can, then I can, too.	2005-04-15

I think that the Mormon culture is fascinating--actually, I think that any sub-culture that is quirky and not accessible to everyone is fascinating.  I live in Utah, and I've noticed that there isn't much media out there that develops the quirky Mormon culture.  Most of the stuff available is either \\"faith promoting,\\" or \\"bashing,\\" and neither of those extremes really gets into any of the interesting parts of the culture.<br /><br />Enter Neil Labute--he sets some very interesting stories in the quirky Mormon culture.  They aren't faith promoting--they aren't negative toward Mormons...they're just stories set in a quirky Mormon culture.<br /><br />This isn't a \\"slice of Mormon life.\\"  It is, as I've heard people say, \\"Good people who happen to do bad things,\\" even though that grossly oversimplifies these stories.  The stories are fantastic, and they have the typical Labute macabre.<br /><br />I suspected that Labute could do Mormons well after the interesting discussion of pornography that he included in \\"The Shape of Things.\\"  But, I was pleasantly surprised by how well he wrote Mormons in a book dedicated to them.<br /><br />Technical stuff--The book is tiny: 96 pages, and small.  Two of the three plays are monologues, and the other is a two-person play.  It doesn't have your typical play notes, like \\"[The lights dim....a bottle breaks in the background].\\"  These \\"plays\\" are 100% dialogue.<br /><br />I knew it would be good, but after reading this book, I'm going to buy all of Labute's plays that are available on amazon.	2005-04-14

This book goes over the Marv story, and I was amazed at how closely the movie followed the book.  The dialog is almost identical.  Most of the scenes were identical.  The couple of parts that were different were very good, like with Marv's mother--they just cut them out so they didn't have too many characters.<br /><br />But, even though it's very similar, it's worth reading even if you've seen the movie already.<br /><br />This first book is totally black and white, but just like the BW scenes in movie, I never noticed that it was a black and white comic while I was reading it.  I think I heard that later comics have more color in them.<br /><br />And, I have to say that I enjoyed the Marv story the best in the movie, so I'm glad it's the first one in the series.  I'm definately going to buy the rest of the Sin City books now that I've read this one.	2005-04-13

It's published by the American Society for Quality (ASQ) so that's probably why the obligatory reference to process improvement.<br /><br />This book is only 89 pages, like it says above, but it's really good for being a short book.<br /><br />This book talks a lot about how to coordinate the efforts of a group to do process mapping.<br /><br />I've always been a lone process mapper.  I think that unless the person who runs the company loves process maps, then you're going to have a hard time getting enough buyoff from management to get together a group of people to just develop a process map.  But, given that you can do that, this is an excellent reference.<br /><br />I hope Dianne writes more books, because she's a really good writer.<br /><br />Also, let me warn you that this book uses simple process examples.  I actually liked that.  I've already done over 100 process maps, but still I learned a lot from this book, even though the examples are simple.<br /><br />The book explains this in the preface.  Dianne says that there would be too much arguement over the best business practices of business examples, and since the point of the book is teaching flowcharting, then she should use examples that are already familiar to everyone, and examples where there will be little debate.<br /><br />That made sense to me, and I really liked this book.	2005-04-08

The book, however, isn't confusing.<br /><br />Basically, their service is a $600 online business valuation where you type in your financials and answer an online questionnaire, and it spits out how much the value of your business is.<br /><br />However, they do provide a lot of content.  And, this has some excellent stuff in it.  It's mostly financial content related to maximizing the value of your business in a sale.  But, that's the kind of thing that you really need if you're selling a business.<br /><br />I think that most business owners will probably pick up this book too late.  The book recommends that you start your preparations to sell at least 3 years before you actually want to sell.  This is targeted toward small business owners, and I've never met a small business owner who really plans that far in advance.  Most people like that become medium-sized business owners very soon after they start planning.<br /><br />One weird thing about the book--the appendices are included after every chapter.  I would recommend that you skip over them--they just regurgitate what was in the chapter.  I wish they would have been all lumped into the back of the book, like they are with most books.  I like to read books all the way through, and so having an appendix after each chapter was distracting.	2005-04-05

The rest is the introduction that I mentioned.<br /><br />The introduction is very mediocre.  It reminds me of if you were to type \\"Chinese Warfare\\" into google, and read the first page that comes up.  It's probably going to be good, but you're probably better off buying an actual book about it.<br /><br />This book is short enough that you can read the 40 pages of text just going to the library.  I wouldn't buy it unless you really want to study it.<br /><br />I bought this book because I heard that it has applications to business.  There really aren't any direct applications to business.  This is a book written to a general of a Chinese army on how to win a battle.<br /><br />I'm sure that you can draw inferences to anything from business to scrapbooking, out of it, though.

I think that's funny.<br /><br />You can learn a lot from this book, but it is fundamentally flawed.  The flaw is that this book is written to CEO's.  This book is not written to you and me.  That means that if you and I read this book, there isn't a d*mn thing that we can do to apply anything we learn from it.<br /><br />There is another gaping flaw in this book, and that is that this book is written in \\"Bible\\" format.  Much like \\"The Goal,\\" \\"Reengineering the Corporation,\\" and the actual Bible, this book gives enough information to make you feel empowered and important, but is loose enough so that you can make any interpretation you want out of it.<br /><br />I've seen so many misinterpretations of this book.  One company interprets \\"The Brutal Facts\\" as an excuse for firing people.  One company forces all of their employees to read this book, hoping that morale will improve.  One company's management reads this book and pats themselves on the back, even though they resemble the comparison companies more than the G2G companies.<br /><br />So, my only hope is that if you're an owner of a company, that you personally apply this book, and don't force a loose interpretation of this book on your employees.  This book is written to you--it's not written to them.<br /><br />Also, all of the people who say that the survey methodology of only doing a dozen companies is bogus--those people are full of crap.  Also, the exhaustive justification given by G2G of how the dozen companies is statistically sound--that's also full of crap.<br /><br />This book isn't a statistics book.  This book is a compilation of observations by a small team about a dozen companies.  No more, no less.  It is neither statistically sound nor statistically unsound.  It's simply observations.<br /><br />This is the ultimate feel good book, if you are a manager.  It's also a good way to claim that you've read a 300+ page management book by only reading 200 pages, since the appendix is 100+ pages long.

But, this was a really good book.<br /><br />The really unique thing about this book is that it is written to regular people--managers of groups of 4 to 10 people.  Most business books are written to CEO's and so regular folks can't relate to them, but this book is written to everyone.<br /><br />This book is all about discovering the strengths of your employees and using those strengths.  I really like that concept.  My philosophy is that your strengths are indelibly tied into your weaknesses, so you can't really get rid of any weaknesses without really dumbing down your strengths.  The book goes along those same lines.<br /><br />The book does a good job at giving a model for \\"the ideal manager,\\" and gives a lot of good, practical advice.  I think you should take their \\"statistically relevant 12 questions\\" with a grain of salt, however, because unless you use the same methodology as they did in administering those 12 questions, you're not going to get results with the same integrity as they did.<br /><br />Or, in laymen's terms--DON'T use this book as a tool for your HR department to come up with a survey so that you can figure out which of your managers are crappy managers.  DO use this book as a tool for managers to read on their own, and you'll find it helps them to become better managers.	2005-04-03

I read the first 50 pages about two pages at a time, and I read the last 3/4 of this book in the last week.<br /><br />The first 50 pages are amazing.  If you take the time and do all of the exercises that she recommends, it will take a while to fully practice all of the stuff that she says, but it is well worth it.<br /><br />I've heard a lot about diaphragm breathing, but Renee did a better job than anyone else on talking about the subject.<br /><br />I also really liked her exercise of recording your voice, and listing out three positives and three negatives about your voice.  This is a very cool exercise, because it forces you to be objective about your voice.<br /><br />What she says about the power of consonants is revolutionary, and has really changed the way that I speak.  So much on speaking and music is vowel-centric, and she explains that, too.<br /><br />I also really liked how she explained the musical undertone of everyday speech.  I've heard of the concept before, but she explained it better than anyone else.<br /><br />The last 150 pages are good, too, but they don't have practice exercises like the first 50, so you can read through them very fast.<br /><br />And, as a final note, I think that Renee Grant-Williams is the James Bond of our day.  Have you ever noticed that James Bond does everything and knows everything?  When did he get the time to learn Afrikaans I sometimes wonder?<br /><br />The same thing with Renee Grant-Williams-she has done everything.  She's an accomplished musician, she does voice training, she's toured with different bands, she did sales for recording companies, she's an amateur homeopath, she's a pet adoption advocate, and I'm sure she's also battled an evil henchman called \\"Jaws\\" on a moon base.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks Renee for a great, life-changing book.	2005-03-26

I've searched for books on it, and none of them seem to be more than 100 pages.  The reason is that there isn't much to mapping out a process.<br /><br />So, for the limited subject material, this book does an excellent job.  It was a fast read.  I think I read it in about 2 hours, going pretty slowly through it.<br /><br />This book talks about three types of process maps, and from the book it says:<br /><br />\\"Since most readers may already have experience with flowcharts, the main emphasis of this book will be on relationship and process maps.  The steps you should follow to create both types of maps are included.\\"<br /><br />However, I think it focused equally on all three of the types of process maps.  I mention this so you don't think that this will jut be a book on flowcharting.<br /><br />I thought it was good, and helpful.  It gave me some new stuff to think about, and it's a basic look at process mapping.  And, like I said, there really isn't a much more complex way of looking at it.	2005-03-26

This book is actually a compilation of various authors on cluttering, and is edited by Dr. St. Louis and Dr. Myers.  They are also the main contributors, but it has a chapter by Dr. Daly, one by Alf Preus, and an excellent introduction by Charles Van Riper.<br /><br />Pages 11-14 are actually readable in the \\"Look Inside This Book\\" section of this amazon page.<br /><br />I liked this book because it gave at least four different views on cluttering.  I think that it is a great follow up to Weiss's book on cluttering, and I hope that another book is written soon on this subject.<br /><br />I'm a clutterer, and this helped me a lot to understand cluttering.  It also spurred a lot of new thoughts about things I can do about cluttering.<br /><br />I think that all Speech Language professionals should read this book.  Like the title says, it's a \\"Clinical Perspective, so it's written to clinicians, and like I mentioned above, it is well worth searching for.	2005-03-26

This is a very good book.  I think that everyone should read it--both men and women.<br /><br />But, and a big BUT--beware!<br /><br />This isn't a book of tricks or techniques.  I don't think that the authors ever meant it to be a \\"Bible\\" where you can randomly read one verse and pick out what you should do that day.<br /><br />There are two of the rules that you have to do:<br /><br />1) Obey all of the rules, and<br /><br />2) Keep obeying the rules after you are married<br /><br />What that means is: A LIFESTYLE CHANGE.  These aren't tips or \\"techniques.\\"  This book is talking about an all-or-nothing lifestlye change.  I'm convinced that the hundreds of one-star reviews and the thousands of people who had this book \\"mess up their life\\" didn't make a lifestlye change.  Instead, they took this book as a book of handy tips and techniques, and started with one of the more complex rules, like never returning phone calls.<br /><br />You can't just pick and choose the rules.  You have to do all of the rules and make a fundamental shift in your thinking.<br /><br />My second point is that even though this is a good book, and I think that all men and women should read this book, that this book is FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED.<br /><br />The flaw in this book is the type of man that the rules attract.  The rules attract a very strong alpha male who is a fundamentally nice and good person, and who is unmarried.  The reason that this is a flaw is that that kind of person just doesn't exist.  Well, actually he does exist, but of the thousands of men that I've ever met, I've only met one of them who fits that mold.  And he's no longer available, because he was married at 21 to a 19-year old.  The problem is that pretty much all strong alpha male types aren't good, nice people.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of women convince themselves that their boyfriend/husband really is the strong alpha male type and is a good person.  I've got news for you--Those things don't go together.  You can be one or the other, but not both.<br /><br />The authors really need to publish two other books--<br /><br />\\"How to Use a Scaled-Down Version of The Rules to Attract a Beta, Gamma, or Epsilon Male.\\"<br /><br />-and-<br /><br />\\"If You Don't Want to Put Any Effort Into The Rules--Use This Exremely Bare Bones Version of The Rules--These Handy Tips and Techniques Will Work a Little Bit\\"<br /><br />Those are the books that the one-star reviewers are looking for.can be one or the other, but not both. <br /> <br />The authors really need to publish two other books-- <br /> <br />\\"How to Use a Scaled-Down Version of The Rules to Attract a Beta, Gamma, or Epsilon Male.\\" <br /> <br />-and- <br /> <br />\\"If You Don't Want to Put Any Effort Into The Rules--Use This Exremely Bare Bones Version of The Rules--These Handy Tips and Techniques Will Work a Little Bit\\" <br /> <br />Those are the books that the one-star reviewers are looking for.	2005-03-25

I read this book from cover to cover.  Toward the end, I plugged on just so that I could write a negative review on amazon.  But, I think that this book changed my mind about reading bad books all the way through just so that I can review them.<br /><br />This is the third of five project management books that I'm reading.  But, after this book, I need to take a break from project management books for a while.  My head hurts--bad.<br /><br />And, this is the worst \\"For Dummies\\" book that I've read, and I've read about 20 of them.  John Wiley and Sons really needs to recall this substandard book.<br /><br />What makes this book so bad?  A few things:<br /><br />1) Stanley Portny is a bad author.  This book has no life.  This book has no soul.  I've read algebra books that breathe more life into the subject material.  I've read statistics and economics books that breathe more life into the subject material.<br /><br />2) This book is extremely repetitive.  Project management has a lot of different subjects to it.  Project management is an exciting subject.  However, he makes everything from Gantt charts to risk management to a work breakdown structure seem like the exact same thing.<br /><br />3) Stanley Portny is extremely arrogant.  This is the first \\"For Dummies\\" book where the word \\"I\\" is the most commonly used word in the book.  The authors of the \\"For Dummies\\" books usually quietly take a back seat to the subject material.  Not in this book--the author is very prominent.<br /><br />4) All of the examples are the same.  This really bugged me.  All of the examples in the book go something like this:<br /><br />At a recent training session, someone came up to me and said, \\"I don't think I need a certain aspect of project management.\\"  Well, I, Stanley Portny, disagreed with this person, and I made every effort to show this person that they were wrong, and that they did need the certain aspect of project managment.<br /><br />You probably think I'm kidding--I'm not.  Every one of the 100 different examples in the book follow this same model.  It seems that Mr. Portny hasn't ever heard the maxim, \\"There's no such thing as a stupid question.\\"  It seems that Mr. Portny's adage that he lives by is, \\"Every question is a stupid question--and an opportunity to show how brilliant I am.\\"<br /><br />Please don't buy this book...unless you're buying the one that I just read that I'm immediately selling used on amazon.probably think I'm kidding--I'm not.

The cover says \\"How to understand people and predict their behavior--anytime, anyplace.\\"  That statement is so extremely misleading about the book.  It makes it seem like the same kind of book that would appeal to the demographic that would buy \\"Becoming a Psychic for Dummies.\\"<br /><br />This book isn't a quick cause and effect book.  You won't be able to use this book like a reference manual, and instantly define or divine things about people.  What you will be able to do is learn how to begin the process of learning to read people better.  And, this really shouldn't be a surprise, because the author says this in the first few pages.<br /><br />I'd like to address some of the complaints about the book:<br /><br />1) The author is conceited.  A: This book is written by an attorney.  You should be prepared for the author to be conceited.<br /><br />2) This book is too simple.  A: It seems simple if you're just looking for a reference book of behaviors and what they mean.  If you think this book is simple, you just don't get it.  Read a little deeper.<br /><br />3) This book is jumbled up and thrown together. A: If you check out a bunch of other reviews on other books, you will find that this is a common complaint by people who don't really read the book that they are reviewing.<br /><br />You'll notice that pretty much all of the really negative reviews are from men, many from men who are professional salespeople.  The author's style is very much from a woman's perspective, and is very professional.  I know a lot of \\"salesmen\\" types that are very intimidated by professional women, and I have to wonder if this is the reason for a lot of the negative reviews.<br /><br />Also, I bought this book in an airport bookstore, too.  I'm not sure why that's important, but it seems like about half of the people who read this book buy it in the airport.	2004-12-24

And, it's as much about marketing a service as it is an exhaustive compendium on the success of Wal-Mart.<br /><br />It gave me a headache.  It's written in Aesop's fable format, with a short tale in each of the 300 sections, and then a simplistic moral at the end of each of them.<br /><br />I can see only two uses for this book.  It could be an introductory book for someone who has never read a business book before, and wants a quick scan of a bunch of business topics.  The other use could be for speakers.  If you want a ready-made 1 minute speech on a business topic, this book has about 300 of them.	2004-12-24

But, I'm a clutterer, and I learned a ton about my speech disorder by reading this book.  It probably wouldn't have the same life-changing results for everyone.<br /><br />This book is written for the speech pathologist, and there is a lot of technical lingo in it, but I found it pretty readable for the lay person.<br /><br />It talks a lot about the personality of a clutterer, which I found extremely helpful.  Before I read this book, I felt like I was alone in the world and that no one understood me completely.  When I realized that my personality traits were shared with clutterers, I no longer felt alone in the world.  I also realized from reading why no one understands me completely.<br /><br />I can't say enough good about this book.  I think it should be a must read for all SLP's (Speech Language Pathologists).  Also, I think that the more that SLP's understand cluttering, that the more that they will understand the root of speech disorders.<br /><br />This book has a compilation of foundational research in it that has yet to be equaled.  I'm glad that Amazon finally put it on their site, and that people are now selling it used.<br /><br />Also, I repeat that this book probably won't give everyone the miraculous results that it gave me.  But, if you are a 25+ year old clutterer, with few or no secondary disorders or problems, then this book will change your life.  And, if you're an SLP, you really should read it.  You should have access to a technical library that has a copy.	2004-12-24

And, this book was more boring than any of my Statistics texts.<br /><br />It is written in textbook format.  It is also written by a bunch of different authors, so it's really disjointed.  As an example, the chapter guest written by an attorney in boring legalese is probably the most interesting.<br /><br />And, they misspelled McDonalds.  In a book about FRANCHISES!  I could understand if they misspelled Wal-Mart in a book about franchises, but how can you write a book about franchises and misspell McDonalds?  See the misspelling on pages 86 and 196.<br /><br />Also, it is written to franchisors, not franchisees.  Since the marketing of the book makes it look like it's trying to appeal to everyone, it took me a few chapters to figure out that it's actually written to franchisors.  Repeat: It is NOT good for franchisees.<br /><br />I did complete the entire book.  I'm not one of those reviewers who calls the book boring after reading a few pages and throwing it away.  I am someone who plugged through so that I could warn everyone else.	2004-12-15

This book doesn't get boring with Wendy's references, because it talks objectively about a lot of different franchises.

It is also funded by private donations, also.  From some internet research that I did, I found that many of the donations come from martial arts masters from various martial arts.<br /><br />I was wondering why so much funding would come from sources like that.  My only guess is that the real ninja masters have some purpose that is unknown at this time.<br /><br />Overall I find the content of the book stellar.<br /><br />However, I am rating this review only four stars, because I would like to see the book and the website have more techniques in them.  I found the content very interesting, but it focuses too much on the lifestyle of the ninjas and not enough on their actual technique.  But, I did find porking a lot of hot babes very interesting, so maybe I'm being too harsh with my four star review.	2004-09-01

It is set in 1930's Manchurian China, during the war.  The book has short chapters that alternate between two main characters: a Chinese girl who is in school, and a Japanese soldier who is part of the occupation of China.<br />The book does an excellent job of showing the difference in culture of both of these people, who come from far different backgrounds.  In chapters with the soldier's perspective, you get a very serious and tactical view of everything, and in the chapters with the girl, you get a very emotional view of everything.<br />I cried at the ending, and even though the criticisms may be right about the plot line being obvious, I still think it is a great book.  I think that everyone would like it.	2004-02-06

I think that the Mormon culture is fascinating in its idiosyncrasies, and I have been excited for a long time at the  prospect of someone writing a book about its idiosyncrasies.<br />Most Mormon  literature that I have read is very preachy in nature.  The climaxes have  been that the protagonist realizes that the Mormonism is for him or her,  and the main struggle has been about whether or not Mormonism is true.  While this can be a good subject, it is entirely overused in Mormon  fiction.<br />This book is different.  It is a book about the complex  relations between Terry-the disturbed mathematics professor, Blake-his gay  son, and Terry Sr.-his homophobic ultra-religious father.  That is why I  say that it defines a new genre, because it is a well-written book about  relationships inside of a Mormon culture, not about a book about  Mormonism.<br />He has a very good vocabulary, and is very good for a first  time novelist.<br />The following paragraph of criticisms made a very minor  impact for my appreciation of this well-written book:<br />If you don't like  flashbacks in books, then this book is not for you.  The book is mostly a  series of flashbacks.  It contains flashbacks within flashbacks, and  contains an every-other-paragraph-is-a-flashback scene.  Also, the narrator  uses words and phrases that are unique to the Mormon culture such as  \\"beseechingly,\\" \\"murmurous,\\" and \\"bear testimony to this truth.\\"  The use  of these phrases is not extreme, but may make this book a little hard for a  non-Mormon to read.  And even though the characters in the book that are  gay are very complex, the discussion of the nature of homosexuality is  relatively simplistic.<br />Also, if you are offended by swear words or by  frank discussions about homosexuality and stories of a sensual nature, then  you will be offended by this book.	2000-06-03

This is  really the only discussion of edibility, so this book is not a guide to  eating mushrooms, but an overall guide to mushrooms.<br />The cover is close  to being waterproof, which makes it excellent for taking into the field.  The pages are high-quality paper.  This book is a tremendous deal!	2000-05-20

It has popular games like Hearts, Rummy, and Cribbage.  It also has games that I have always wanted to learn how to play, like Euchre and Canasta.  In all, the book discusses over twenty  games.<br />The layout of the book is a discussion about games.  Even if you  have felt confused before in reading through card game rules, this book is  an excellent introduction to playing card games.  It goes over everything  that happens in the game, from the rules, to strategy and tips, to history  of the game-a fascinating book.<br />Because it goes in-depth into each of the  games, you will not find one place in the chapter that has a concise list  of the rules.  The rules are scattered throughout the discussion of the  chapter.  I found it useful to check a book of rules from the library to  read along with this book.	2000-05-20

This book is great  for people like me-I loved PAC-MAN but was never really that good.  Now,  with this book, I'm becoming a winner.<br />This 128-page book was published  in 1981, only a year after the release PAC-MAN.  Part of the draw for this  game is how Uston described the game of PAC-MAN:<br />\\"PAC-MAN, a little  yellow fellow who looks like he has a smile on his face\\"<br />\\"The player  grabs the red control knob (or `joystick')\\"<br />\\"The ever present monsters  soon catch up with and `eat' PAC-MAN\\"<br />Besides being a classic, this book  gives a great discussion of the game.  The game of PAC-MAN is broken down  into five patterns that are presented in a very easy-to-understand manner.  These five patterns are all you really need to know to master PAC-MAN.  The  illustrations, though simple, are excellent.	2000-05-20
US	52862683	R10536DPIFZBJ9	0156907399	762777669	To the Lighthouse	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Short and Intense Book	Woolf's sentence structure is entrancing, and her descriptions of the thoughts of the characters are vivid.  I was intrigued at what goes on inside of Woolf's head because of profundities such as \\"the very stone one  kicks with one's boot will outlast Shakespeare,\\" and \\"so much depends ...  upon distance: whether people are near or far from us.\\"<br />It is nice that a  book this intense can be a quick read.  Anyone can read it and feel that  they have accomplished something, not just the erudite.  However, to really  appreciate To the Lighthouse, you will have to read it a few  times.<br />Woolf's writing style will be hard for many.  She forms many  complex sentences.  The book is mostly about the internal struggles of her  characters rather than a physical action book.  Still, this is a very  poignant book, and her prose is artistry with a purpose.<br />Skip the forward  by Eudora Welty if you don't want a summary of the action of the book.	2000-05-17

At first glance, it sounds too good to be true.  The catch...<br />An extremely comprehensive plot summary for  each chapter will only take about 25 words.  That's right-it takes place  over the course of a day and a night, and the action can be completely and  all-inclusively summarized in only 450 words.  However, there are only two  ways to get this summary:  1) five or six years of study, or 2) by reading  a Cliffs Notes-type book.<br />This book has been fairly assessed as  incomprehensible, numbing, nightmarish, and mind-numbing.  The average  reader will have a excruciatingly grim time completing this book.<br />Still,  I am convinced that anyone who reads every word of this book will love and  embrace it.  Be warned, the love and embrace do not happen immediately.  After reading the first 90 pages, I had the worst headache in my life.  I  could not read for five more days.  I hated the next four hundred pages of  the book.  Around page 500, I began to embrace this beloved work.  It took  the last 250 pages to achieve a unity and oneness with the book.<br />I'm one  of those people who reads the dictionary for fun.  Because of this, I know  a lot of words that I've never heard or have never read.  Ulysses changed  that.  I think that he used every word that I have ever learned by reading  the dictionary, but have not heard in life.  Finding those words in print  is worth reading the 700+ pages.<br />As a smattering of the jewels of  perspicacity of James Joyce, I have included my four favorite parts of the  book.  If you like this small morsel of the volume, you will love the rest.  Enjoy!<br />1.  Moses, Moses, king of the jews, wiped his arse in the Daily  News.<br />2.  Love loves to love love.<br />3.  Q.  Did Bloom accept the  invitation to dinner...?  A.  Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation,  with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity  of regret, he declined.<br />4.  Q.  What in water did Bloom ... admire?  A.  Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in  seeking its own level ... [Insert 30 more things about water] ... the  noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded  flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon., in appreciatively grateful sincerity  of regret, he declined. <br />4.

It gives general information that every manager should know, and it gives specific strategies to deal with management problems and concerns.  I liked how Plenert shows that people perform based on what you measure them by.  I also like how he stated that in order to be a World Class Manager, you must first become a World Class Person.	1997-10-01
