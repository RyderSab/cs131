US	52573608	R2B1FA865ZEN0S	1400042267	59870239	Lost in the Forest	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Getting It Right	A story of family, divorce, remarriage and death with an overlay of that element that makes the whole world go around (but if I spell it out here, the Ammy Nanny will get me).  The family of Mark and Eva dissolved over his infidelity and then Eva and John's family disintegrates in tragedy.  The dynamics of the remaining parents, the children of each marriage, and the history are spectacularly etched out in a Napa Valley of the 1980s.  Each character handles all the drama so very differently, but like a clock, all gears go together into a bizarre whole.  Daisy, easily the least likeable of the children, eventually becomes the focus of the novel, which is very credibly crafted and, well, a little bit creepy.  The evolution of the children into adults is chronicled with detail - Sue Miller does an excellent job of creating very human characters and dialogue.  Miller's depiction of the children of divorce as \\"collateral damage\\" was breathtaking in its accuracy.  Contentment, risks, relationships - of lives lived, of lives to be lived, it is all here and breathtakingly set out.  -Mamalinda	2005-08-17

Though published in 2003, and not highly dated in other respects - the lack of cell phones is the first thing I noticed that seemed \\"off\\" - and then the lack of computers, on-line research, etc.  Was this book written years ago, found in a box, and published, or is the author a complete Luddite?  Government conspiracies, drug traffic, ex-cons, female in a guy job - and  the female characters are almost blow-up dummies and actually \\"do\\" very little except when they interact in bed - it's definitely a boy book.  The setting could have been lush and sensual but instead was only a pen and pencil drawing, with a few strolls down the beach.  The character motivations were unusual, and the alternating smoking/jogging of the protagonist was just ... goofy?  All in all - this book did not work for me.<br /><br />It's readable.  But sure doesn't even come close to Pat Conroy or Anne Rivers Siddons or even Dorthea Benton Frank.	2005-06-20

Nor had I considered African witch doctors.  Alexander McCall Smith takes the reader into modern day Botswana and introduces us to Precious Ramotswe, owner of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency.  A \\"traditionally built\\" woman, with a reverence for her native country and its customs, Mme. Ramotswe is a long way from the lady detectives on television.  The language is poetic and charm of this book lies in the simplicity of the writing and well crafted intuitions and observations of Mme. Ramotswe.  With gentility and common sense, Precious Ramotswe finds the solutions to an assortment of predicaments .<br /><br />The writing is inspired, the setting is vivid and the characters are elegantly believable.  The book was finished long before this reader was ready to leave Botswana behind.  Happily this is the first in a series.  Let me also highly recommend the recorded version (unabridged, of course), read in musical South African accent by Lissette Lecat.  This book (and series) should delight all ages.	2005-03-08

This book provides an amazing amount of insight into the emotional upheaval the birth mother undergoes through pregnancy, adoption and the rest of her life, as well that of her parents, the birth father, siblings and the relationships and family that follow.  The \\"return policy\\" was certainly an eye opener!  An adoptive mother loaned me this book, and even though I am of the same generation as the author, the treatment of the unwed mother was barbaric, insensitive, shocking and the lack of counseling just another way in which society has failed.  A \\"must read\\" for most adoptees and adoptive parents, but also instructional for anyone who has ever known anyone involved in the adoption process.<br /><br />That said, the book is also very dated.  For more recent adoptees and parents, the experience is very different.  Even though published in 1992, much of the information is now more readily accessible thanks to the Internet.	2004-11-24

With slush in his shoes and a life that lacks color, Oswald T. Campbell bids farewell to a bleak and wintry Chicago after the doctor delivers an unexpected death sentence.  A very old brochure magically directs Oswald to Lost River, Baldwin County, Alabama, for his last months.  As Oswald settles in, life suddenly becomes Technicolor and the kind of \\"family is where you find it\\" interaction gives all the characters of Lost River a reason to live and love.  Jack, the redbird, is conniving little pest who knits the disparate characters into a wonderful whole.<br /><br />This is an easy recommendation for ALL ages.

Frequently over the top and salaciously funny, there is little or no realism to this equation.  While it is possible to take the girl out of Brooklyn, it is harder to take Brooklyn out of the girl?  While Kate Jameson has escaped her roots, she isn't the most sympathetic of characters, and the Bitches are of Brooklyn are little more than thinly drawn caricatures.  The convoluted premise of the story is more than a stretch - but escapism is always a fun indulgence, and that's exactly what this tale is.	2004-09-17

I picked this up thinking \\"Sweet Potato Queens\\" or \\"Jennifer Cruisie\\" or one of those sassy chick lit tomes. Instead, I'm finding understanding and strength and comfort - and LOTS of insight and wisdom.<br /><br />The story revolves around 4 neighbor women - from all walks of life and ethnicities - and one ghost.  Roberta has just lost her husband of 60+ years; Trudy is on the brink of an empty nest when she discovers her husband's affair and throws him out;  Roberta's granddaughter Jade is freshly out of a demoralizing marriage; and Shanelle is an escapee from white trailer trash, with two young sons and a macho husband who doesn't begin to understand her need to write.  The women's boxing element nearly turned me from the book, but ended up being an interesting element.  And the ghost Lucille was after my own middle aged, adventure seeking heart.  The strength of women comes through in each page, not brassy or sassy, but faithful and steadfast and caring.<br /><br />One particularly inspiring quote picked up the place in life where I live:  \\"But the evening looms. The house thunders with emptiness. How could my old life be over so suddenly that after years and years of never having a minute to draw my breath now I have so much time that I feel myself sinking into it like quicksand, drowning in it?  A mother finished. A wife dismissed.\\"	2004-09-16

Set during the busy Christmas season, Bretta is a busy and ambitious florist, hoping to cash in on the season of spending.  However, the tale takes more of a Halloween turn when the former owner of the mansion is strangled with the cord of some Christmas lights.  Fast paced, the timing seems off in this book, and too many different components come into play.  The widowed Bretta has fallen off her diet, her long lost father has made contact, and the former owner of her new home has made some interesting demands, and Bretta has issues with the sheriff.  A few red herrings are to be expected in a cozy mystery, but this one meandered past the point of plausibility on many counts.  A baffling &quot;flower&quot; arrangement, with too many design elements?	2004-04-25

Bretta Soloman is a grief stricken widow who has managed to lose 100 pounds.  She also is a florist, and a good friend to an Amish man whose brother coincidentally grows flowers, but who is found with his neck broken in his field.

Ms. Harrison doesn't hesitate to deliver characters you won't like, but does manage to deliver an interesting first novel.	2004-04-25

Somewhat silly and unrealistic but with some interesting details, all with strong evangelical fundamentalist undertones and characters who are mighty quick to don their cloak of righteousness.  Misunderstandings and bickering abound, and the &quot;feminine love interest&quot; in two of the stories actually strikes out physically.  I struggled with the rigidity and hostility.  There is little gentleness or grace - but rather there IS a high level of spoon-fed &quot;belief.&quot;<br />So, perhaps I should just avoid &quot;Christian Romance&quot; entirely? Well, if there had been any hint on the cover of this collection, I might have done exactly that.  But I did bother to read these (bother being the key word?) and would instead refer the gentle reader to the fiction of Frederick Buechner, Jan Karon and Philip Gulley.

The guests might arrive by dinghy, or motorcycle or more conventional transportation.  Lola, transplanted American hostess welcomes her guests and treats them to culinary wonders each evening on the terrace over looking the shimmering sea.  But all is not well at the Hotel Riveria, Lola's husband Patrick having disappeared without a trace and the police (who were initially reluctant to investigate the missing husband) are now eyeing Lola suspiciously.  Add to this a Queenly British guest, a naked man from an anchored sloop, a greedy millionaire on an enormous yacht, and a sleek and sexy \\"childhood friend\\" of the missing husband - as well as a  couple of loving pets and the formula moves from languid vacation to international intrigue.

Beginning with a series of disasters during Megan Donaghue's wedding, the reader is then transported to Ireland with sister Peggy and her autistic young son Kieran to the home of a dying distant cousin.  Misunderstandings, pubs and saloons, alcoholism, schizophrenia, debilitating grief, miracles, and autism, as well as the requisite red-headed Irish tempers give the story realism, and the setting is casually comfortable.

Mr. Mowat paints a vivid picture of the artic region and the various boondoggles designed to &quot;help&quot; the native peoples (which certainly parallels the wretched treatment of Native Americas in this country).

While the premise sounds fun and interesting, believe me - it is not.  Too many characters pour into the first chapter and by the final page I cared not one bit for any of them - there was no realism and no character development.  Language is strong, backstabbing is laced throughout the book, the Christmas part is limited to a study of the tacky decorations in an Atlantic City casino.  There is not a bit of charm, cleverness, or grace - ballroom dancers are represented as toupee wearing, shallow and out of touch, with partners frequently betraying each other.

Holocaust survivor stories meet a coming of age in the 60s tale, seasoned with sand and sea, betrayals, mental illness and drunkenness, which then evolves into a novel of family, faith, friends and forgiveness.  There are numerous vivid and emotionally rich stories within this book, and many social statements.  The language is stunningly brilliant, the characterizations are almost caricatures but somehow quite believable. A multilayered book, that not only maps out the city of Rome, but which is rich in the cadence of the South (specifically low country of South Carolina) with side trips to California, Minnesota, the hills of Appalachia, Canada and Nazi occupied Europe.  Between the places and the stories, music and food weave in and out, and this was a book I was sad to finish.  Crossing my fingers for a film and a soundtrack to go along with it.	2003-12-21

Zoe, the pampered and loved child is all that matters any more.  As the marriage unravels at the seams, the reader is permitted insight into the whys and hows this came to be: &quot;the catalogue of intentional slights, his moments of soft cruelty, his awareness of complicity in creating a relationship that could not work&quot;.  An unsympathetic wife who is shy and difficult to know, a husband who is passively content and unwilling to see his own lack of contribution.  When Griffin refuses to move, the marriage moves on to a &quot;roommate: situation and the two alternate nights out.  Ellen goes to her lover and Griffin finds himself employed as Santa and having a couple of dates.  Watching lives spiral off and become unrecognizable, the hindsight required to see what really was good and what might not have been - the early contentedness moving onto complacency and becoming contempt.

With a touch of whimsy, author Reich, offers the reader a recovering alcoholic named Temperance, with a failed marriage and grown daughter, a southerner finding her way about in a very different environment.  The introduction to the French-Canadian city of Montreal comes complete with a map (I adore a book with a MAP!) and a delicious description of a Canadian summer:  &quot;When summer arrives in Montreal it flounces in like a rumba dancer .... It is a ribald celebration that begins in June and continues until September.  The season is embraced and relished.  Life moves into the open.  After the long, bleak winter, outdoor cafes reappear, cyclists and Rollerbladers, compete for the bike paths, festivals follow quickly one after another on the streets, and crowds turn the sidewalks into swirling patterns.&quot;<br />This novel is low on the testosterone fueled &quot;blood and guts&quot; of typical thrillers going straight for the bones of the issue, sometimes in excruciating and disgusting detail.  Could there be a serial killer in Montreal?  And exactly what has Tempe's college chum Gabby gotten herself into this time?  In wonderfully set scenes, a Testy Tempe begins puzzling out the bones like a jigsaw puzzle ... which causes more than a little conflict with the chauvinistic and impeccably tailored  homicide investigator Luc Claudel.  And is there something behind the flashing blue eyes of Detective Ryan?  Alternately, clever, tedious, insightful, a thought provoking - this was an enjoyable read.-Mamalinda	2003-11-29

Reconstructing the blown up Vallancourt twins was an interesting exercise - but pointless?  Does this really happen?  The turf wars of rival motorcycle gangs have been taking a few innocent bystanders with them, and keeping the morgue quite busy.  Tempe is on hand when a pair of decade old bodies are recovered ... and also finds a very mysterious skull.  Some bizarre coincidences make this book a little hard to grasp at times.  Nephew Kit makes an appearance and manages to get in with just the wrong crowd.  Tempe's keeping company with the feline Birdie mostly, since something odd is up with Detective Ryan.  But the scene where Tempe blunders into the Biker Bar looking for her nephew is so chillingly threatening that it should be mandatory reading for any female titillated by bikers - startlingly raw, frightening and realistic, the reader is left with no illusions on the value of women to these outlaws.

And along comes a dear friend (who usually knows my reading tastes) and hands me the recorded version saying that it &quot;gets better&quot; and that I would enjoy it.  Well, it didn't and I didn't.  Basically this story is an obituary for a dying high school football coach, as well as a treatise on the insanity that goes along with this game.  If you love to rehash every minute detail of football games from the distant past and if football is a religious experience for you, ... well, this will be a wonderful read!<br />Letting the author read this book was also a mistake - Grisham's reading would be just lovely for a short story, but 4 CDs of his rather flat, accented monotone didn't spice up anything, and his switching from character to character was disingenuous: Silo: &quot;Blah, Blah, Blah.&quot;  Neely: &quot;Blah, Blah, Blah.&quot;<br />I have considered myself a long time Grisham fan (including Painted House and especially Skipping Christmas).

It was very interesting to me to move outside my &quot;buddy list&quot; (middle aged white women) and meet &quot;the dirty girls&quot; (sucias).  A very regionally diverse cluster of college buddies who stay in touch after their graduation from Boston University.  Living in Texas where golden brown skin often times means &quot;immigrated at some point from Mexico&quot; - I was less aware of the cultural differences between Cubans, Columbians, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, as well as the many various backgrounds of the less recent immigrants and/or natives of this country.  Ms. Valdez-Rodriguez shows the reader the many different points of reference and I promise that I learned something.  While the writing is light and fun, some heavy subjects are addressed, and each sucia personality is conveyed in a way where they quite become real, warts and all.  Latino males do not fare particularly well, although the Sucias do manage to find a few keepers.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and would highly recommend it.  Actually, I am hoping the Dirty Girls will reappear in a few years time, with more interesting life experiences.	2003-10-13

But as a casual reader (who might only get to read 5 to 10 pages at a sitting), I found there were too many characters to keep up with, too many pronouns to figure out who was who, and that the graphic and unimaginative insertions of &quot;love scenes&quot; were more gratutious than necessary for the plot line.  It was fun to see the Anna character grow (or shrink?), and the plot lines and mystery seem forced, unrealistic and unlikely.	2003-10-05

In the past, I found Mr. Koontz' books to have a clever premise, to be thought provoking, and to have an &quot;unable to put down&quot; element.  This one I put down quite easily.  Actually, Dean Kartoontz seems to be the scary monster that is emerging - too great now for a critical editor that would chop this book in at least half?

In her first foray into the world of personal ads, Sarah manages to select a Mr. Right who is none other than her own widowed father.

In Job's Crossing, if the cholesterol doesn't kill you the colloquialisms might.  Please note that the term \\"funeralized\\" really ISN'T an every day term in Texas, nor do we all talk like this.  The charm of grandma/detective Biggie and grandson/detective J.R. almost overcomes the hokey-ness of the time warp they appear to be stuck in.  While the local actuarial tables would surely indicate that Job's Crossing could be hazardous to your health, never fear, for Biggie and J.R. will surely sort things out.  Gossip, glop, and a spare grandma all garnish this very corny, colloquial cozy mystery.	2003-07-24

No stranger to the time warp of East Texas, these books capture some of that essence but are really just \\"too\\" homespun sometimes.  Grandmother Biggie (about as big as a minute) is raising grandson J.R. with the help of Willa May (cook/voodoo priestess) and her husband Rosebud (handyman and teller of tall tales).  In this installment, the noisy mailman sticks his nose into danger on a number of counts and before the story ends another character will bite the dust too.  Corrupt politicians, a mystery pitcher, hate driven militia (roughly based on the Republic of Texas), and someone who is certainly something quite different from what it seems.  The story travels all over the place with plenty of stops for down home eating, detecting, and some tension building.  Light, frothy and silly; homespun and harried.	2003-07-22

Justice becomes an oxymoron as the main character is led astray from his values, from the girl he loves and greed takes over.  An expose on the big business of advertising, pharamaceuticals, mass torts, environmentalism and sprawl, corporate and personal greed, with a bit of product liability and temptation tossed in for seasoning.  Grisham has a way of painting a picture, and being a moralist, and having a clever twist at the end and his sarcastic comments are always (to me) quite wonderful.  The author also seems to be a man I can respect when it comes to affairs of the heart.  His view point of the failings of our justice system, and the greed of the men in suits may result in the reader having a different perspective on the pharmaceutical industry and class action lawsuits.	2003-07-22

A startling look into the lives of two couples and their children, and the \\"me me me\\" that infects most of our lives.  Beautifully set on Flame Lake in Minnesota, with the four adults and one child alternating narration, this is a peek into how very different things look to each person involved.  The reader is introduced to the incredible ego of BiDi;  12 year old Darcy, who \\"plans on being a world traveler someday, mostly for the experience but partly for the hats\\" (can you tell she was my favorite character?); the philandering but deeply committed family man Sergio (the \\"Ricky Ricardo of Minnesota); the lovable/irritating car salesman/wannabe lounge lizard Dick; and his wife Devera, who is going through plenty of internal crises - the narration really makes the story of the repercussions of a terrible attack in the small town of Flame Lake.

Yes, we HAVE become consumer zombies, and a reconnect with reality is necessary and desirable.  While I might not embrace the suburban ideal I also have to decline many of Callenbach's ideas: powdered milk, building my own furniture, using a public hospital, going on welfare, scavenging old food at the grocery store, living in a mobile home or a gypsy wagon, and raising bees are not what I consider viable stylishness.<br />Callenbach's ideas are wildly opinionated (but what did I expect) and way too out there to entice most of the consumer zombies to do anything but laugh.  He does say some important things about packaging, advertising, and brand names, as well as the ever insidious &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; consumers buy into with regularity.  This is a well thought out and constructed book, but one with little practical value for this user.	2003-04-19

While doing an admirable job as a substitute teacher, she becomes aware of bit of oddness and suddenly finds herself in the midst of a very unusual murder case.  Jeanne Dams does an EXCELLENT sense of setting in her cozy mysteries, and the detective work is plausible.  The Dorothy Martin character with her wacky hats and nosy questions does get on my nerves just a bit, but I like her anyway.

Family life with Tom is wonderful, but is Arch is turning into a teenage monster?  Wherever Goldy takes on a catering job, murder is sure to happen (and it isn't the yummy-licious food, either, recipes included).  The \\"Princess Without a Price Tag Party\\" starts off with Goldy nearly being run over and ends in murder, and Julian being carried off to jail.  Run away dump trucks, compulsive shoppers, an unidentified and an identified corpse, a new hound, snow, lacrosse, jail, espresso, cookies, prime rib, and plenty of puzzles abound.  In her latest culinary mystery, Dianne Mott Davidson returns the reader to Aspen Meadows and a rendezvous with old and new friends ... and Murder.  Fortunately, The Jerk (Goldy & Marla's ex-husband) stays very far in the background this time.  Unfortunately Goldy's church family also seems to have moved into the background, a concession I regret.	2003-04-05

Family dynamics might have been amusing to someone more familiar, but were simply an irritation to this reader.  Replacement hips, broken shoulders, deafness, dementia and free loading 30-year old kids simply are not amusing.  Too many characters, living and dead, that just kept popping up throughout the book made it almost impossible to keep up with the story, the chatter was over the top, but not delightfully so, and the mystery was so very convoluted I really didn't CARE who had done it - I was just ready for the book to end.  Where Ms. Danheim REALLY lost me though, was when a character was calling the airlines to check on passenger manifests.  There should be SOME reality in a cozy mystery, some clever twists, and a lot more of setting and research by my thinking.  This was a senseless hodgepodge.	2003-04-05

But it might give credibility to the child who understands powerlessness?  Probably the intended audience has some experience along those lines?  I thoroughly enjoyed the interweaving of vocabulary and definitions, Violet's \\"inventing\\" tendencies, Klaus's fascination with books, and the rather smarmy narrator conveys MUCH with his voices.  This should appeal to an adolescent who might not buy the goody-two-shoes books directed at that generation.  My friend who recommended this series says that the books become more clever language wise, and that the author \\"starts making his views known on things he finds absurd - for instance, people who follow trends, the \\"in\\" crowd, etc.\\"  So, I think I'll stick with Lemony for a bit.	2003-04-04

The story of PMT (PMS) was so stunningly and brilliantly on target that it should become mandatory reading.

Not a exactly a cozy mystery, the reader always knows &quot;whodunit&quot; - but the arrival of Cass, Livia and Julia in the present makes much of the past.  The twists of hate and betrayal are very realistic, as well as Livia's adjustment to society.  Ms. Layton etches a clever cast of characters in a very unusual situation.  I am hoping she went rather over-the-top with her portrayal of a merciless press, but I sense that she got the vengeful characters just right.  A five star read!	2003-02-16

IN THE HEART OF THE SEA was passed along to me by a reading friend at work. This would not have been a book I would have picked up without her strong recommendation. It is one of the best written books I've read in a long time, a scholarly compilation of information as well as a journal and a notebook left behind by survivors of the whaling ship The Essex which was attacked by a whale. This is the same story that Melville adapted MOBY DICK from.  Melville, however, only had access to the journal of the First Mate, and since that time a notebook kept by the cabinboy has come to light. The author, Nathaniel Philbrick, takes those, and thoroughly researches not only the time and the industry, but the history of Nantucket, including the lives of the women (who basically ran things as whaling might require a voyage of 2-3 years) and the peace loving Quakers, who became a rather blood thirsty lot when chasing whales.  The book also includes a wonderful collection of maps and photographs. [Only the BEST armchair books include maps and pictures!]  The extreme arrogance of man, to cast out into huge oceans (and I mean plural, for the whalers went right around  the Cape) to take on these giants of the sea.  Imagine - no GPS, no radios, no tracking, no instant communications.  To go  after these huge sea creatures in small boats with harpoons - and once they lanced the whale it was a merry ride, like a runaway carriage. The author skillfully knits the story together with lot of scholarly research into the effects of starvation, the plundering of the whale (very much along the scale of the buffalo) and the effects on the people who live through this, the leadership or politics of the ships as well as the whaling island of Nantucket. Let me HIGHLY recommend, and ... interestingly enough the Spousal Unit LISTENED when I  recommended that he should at least look at the pictures and diagrams ... and he just inquired if I \\"had trouble putting the book down\\" (and he is NOT a reader).f I \\"had trouble putting the book down\\" (and he is NOT a reader).	2003-01-26

Keeping the FUN in dysFUNctional, she paints a bizarre cartoon of a family living in a small Georgia town, of small town politics (with a dose of religion for flavoring) and the journey of a broken heart and self discovery.

I do wish I could have LIKED Elizabeth (Birdie) Shore a little better, &quot;poor little misunderstood rich girl&quot; comes to mind here, though. The Jackson Shore character really didn't have much depth to him beyond himself and his beloved sports.  Did he ever really &quot;get it&quot;?  Some of the women characters were richly sketched, and the daughters were artfully portrayed as a study in contrasts.  The setting on the Oregon coast was well detailed and occasionally breathtaking but does it match the rather tropical looking cover of the book?  Just a lot of bits and pieces that did not work for me - the single handed destruction of the dining room wall being one of them.  Some of the rough language seems to come from no where and seems unnecessary and a bit trite.  Not a favorite book, but Ms. Hannah does have an interesting spin on the staleness of a marriage, what makes a family, and finding yourself again.	2002-12-26

No, it's probably never going to happen this way, but it's fun, it's charming, and the dogs will warm your hearts too. The Lucy character manages to be smart, cute, sassy and independent, which is a big improvement over some of the lame ladies in romantic fiction. Zach, as the macho policeman, is a bit much but able to be taught. Crusie also allows the reader a certain amount of imagination when it comes to the lustier moments.

Dorothy Martin is a retired American schoolteacher and recent newlywed to retired Chief Constable Alan Nesbitt.  Escaping the constant rain in their cathedral town, this unlikely pair of sleuths head for the sunshine at the seaside, and another peek at a decades old crime.  The likelihood of a repeat of that crime is a stretch, and Dorothy crosses the line between caring and interested into nosy and bossy one time too many for this reader.  The story has moments of charm and a sense of place, but could have benefited from a map (most books could?).  Not a strong recommendation, but still an interesting escape.	2002-12-01

Indeed, they become quite real.  Ella Brady, beautifully cool, the perfect child, the loved schoolteacher and the Ultimate Ice Maiden, indulges in an affair of the heart with a married man.  Ella manages to get not only herself, but also her family and friends, terribly and publicly burned by the experience.  In an effort to pay back debts, Ella joins forces with friends and proposes a documentary video on the Dublin restaurant Quentins.  Quentins is familiar to all the faithful readers, as are many of the characters.  With what can only be genius, this very seasoned author skillfully weaves many tales within Ella's tale, and allows us to renew our acquaintenance with many characters from earlier books (including the twins, Simon &amp; Maude who once again completely charmed me).  Maeve Binchy characters receive realistic and sympathetic treatment, the dialogue is enormously enchanting, and this reader felt like she was closing her suitcase after a delightful trip to Dublin when I turned that last page and closed the book.<br />Let me say also that this is a beautiful book.  The cover captures exactly the feeling of the writing and the inside flyleaf is a rich and striking touch.	2002-11-12

From Outlander to Outlandish - this 1000 page tome (lots of book for the buck - with very small margins and fonts), the focus is not so much on history, or romance, but bodily secretions.  ... nothing is so disgusting that it is overlooked - perhaps it should be renamed The Complete Book of Bodily Fluids?  In addition to the penicillin experiments, gangrene, and an unorthodox autopsy, this tale certainly qualifies as an amazingly sick effort.  No, I'm not kidding.

With this book, the author really turns her pen into a paintbrush.  \\"We sat together staring contemplatively at the startled looking sea wavelets racing before the fresh breeze, at the clean carved shapes of the Islands; at the gently blue sky strewn with clouds that looked as soft and inviting as white fur rugs; at mists lit with rainbows and mountains silvered with sunlight.\\"  The visuals of the scenery are quite simply breathtaking, as are the wonderful characters that just spring from the pages.  With gentleness and a great deal of humor, the idiosyncrasies of the villagers are delivered in a forthright, but never condescending manner.  The hygiene of this time and place will make a modern mama's blood run cold (and probably the postman's too) and the brutal work load will make you grateful for our modern conveniences.  I predict you will love the charming journey into another place and time - but probably be glad you are traveling via armchair.  While this book stands on its own, I am glad I read it after the other three Bruach books:  The Hills is Lonely, The Sea for Breakfast and The Loud Halo.  The book also contains a delightful little list of Gaellic translations and pronunciations. --Silly Old Cailleach Mamalinda	2002-10-21

This is a glimpse into the loving legacy of a grandfather who reaches out beyond Alzheimers, beyond depression, to comfort and counsel and to guide not only his granddaughter Emily, but to heal old wounds too.  The wisdom of life experiences - absent the wounds, the shared history and the vanity devices we put in place.  The presentation of the book of poetry and clues for Harry's story is a pure delight.  Originally self published, a good editor might have insisted on a little more characterization and better dialogue, but the premise was artfully done. I heartily recommend it.	2002-10-20

A delight from the first page, Jordan Lacy is a most unconventional former police woman turned private investigator/junk shop dealer/jazz connoisseur. As she pedals about Latchings, the dialogue and characterization are absolutely charming - as is Jordan's very active fantasy life.  With a caseload that includes stolen water lilies, a missing wedding cake, as well as a errant husband, Jordan has her sights set on acquiring the Ladybird, a little red coupe with black spots.  As she moves on to missing bankers, mistresses, murder and arson, Jordan finds herself a suspect.  Taking plenty of time for a cup of tea or coffee here and there, Jordan eventually fits together the puzzle pieces - and surprises everyone.  The end seemed very rushed and implausible, but did not diminish my delight in another Jordan Lacy book.	2002-10-20

Dams delivers a cozy mystery that could, should, but really doesn't, deliver.  The setting and cast of characters is clever, with Hilda and family, the Swedish immigrants settled into the ethnically diverse city of South Bend.  Hilda has a romantic interest in the ever so unacceptable Roman Catholic immigrant Patrick Cavanaugh; as well as a smitten police sergeant.  Hilda works as a maid in the home of the Studebaker family, called Tippecanoe (look it up on the internet, a fascinating residence).  While obviously well researched, the story gets muddled with entirely too much dashing about like the proverbial chicken, too many silly misunderstandings and plenty of lying. Erik, Hilda's completely out of control 12 year old brother, finds himself on the run from a child molester.  Somehow Dams works in the historical Orphan Train and the itinerant small circuses.  Many parts of this book just don't seem to ring true, and Hilda was rather unappealing as a nosy, know-it-all, busy body unconcerned with lying to her superiors.  More history, more realism, and less silly dialogue and convoluted misunderstandings might have helped this book.  Three stars, almost a worthwhile read.	2002-10-06

With very different perspectives and the usual mother/daughter drama, this is a very richly readable book that reminds me a lot of Pilcher and Binchy. The dialogue is a little muted, but this is intellectual (as in \\"use your imagination\\") non-bodice ripper kind of romance. An amazing weaving into a very enjoyable book that will take the reader from the Cornish Coast, to swinging London, to Scotland and ... then on to Afghanistan. The timing of this book makes the story all the more interesting in light of current events.<br />There is another generational novel entitled LEGACY OF LOVE which, if you are a more orderly person than I, you may wish to read first.

Cinderella finds her prince on a Caribbean beach, but he's afraid of spiders.  The poor little servant girl falls for the young master.  An ages old mystery emerges that probably doesn't matter anymore.  Plenty of nasty secrets and lies.  The wisely beautiful and seductive Godmother knows almost as much as the oh so faithful and humble retainer.  Peeks into a London literary scene that only bore.  Women pandering to their men who patronize them in return.  The premise of Victoria and her Gardens of Laybridge only teases, as the only flowers really mentioned are those named Lilly, Rose and Daisy.  If your idea of a really fabulous story includes adults who sleep most of the day, drink too much, and who are catty and snide and unfaithful to each other - then this is the book for you!  An insulting, pompous, shallow and dull story, written by a condescending author.  Lovely book for an Anglo-Snob.<br />Obviously, I really really didn't like it.

Raunchy, Ribald, and Randy	Much, much naughtier than my usual read, still TALKING TO ADDISON was a sublimely droll peek into the life of Holly Livingstone and Friends.  The dialogue is quick paced, very British, sarcastic, witty and utterly coarse, lewd, vulgar and bawdy.  An eccentric and highly amusing bit of farce that kept me laughing throughout.  The reader will meet some bizarrely enchanting characters as well as learn when a kiss is NOT just a kiss.  Some screamingly hysterical scenes of \\"a model of a Modern Major General\\" together \\"with many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.\\"<br />If you are missing a sense of humor or easily offended or snared in a quagmire of conformity, I would recommend giving this one a pass.

However, I find her mysteries are convoluted and highly improbable.  This particular cast of characters lack a certain believability/plausibility and the story line meanders until no one knows (or cares) where it is going.  Anna Pidgeon sets off for Glacier National Park to track bears in this installment, the first chapter of which is actually rather repulsive and gross, and we learn about what attracts bears.  Lots of bear lore and gorgeous glimpses of wild places, but (again) a highly unlikely tale.  While the bears can certainly be scary, Anna does receive a sexual harassment threat that was the most terrifying thing in the book.  There is also a plethora of spelling and editing errors in the book, and the map with the west on top was more annoying than helpful.  I will continue to read these books for the glimpses of nature, the flora, fauna and beautiful parks, but I won't expect much in the way of a plot.	2002-09-10

In this dark, but very compelling voyage, Annie Proulx introduces us to an ordinary man, the hulking, clueless news reporter, the unfavorite son, the ever unlucky Quoyle.  Quoyle's very bad marriage ends with the always faithless wife Petal having sold their two young daughters.  Petal and the man she is running with are killed in a horrific crash.  After locating his daughters, Quoyle seeks a very different life.  Returning with his aunt to the old homestead in Newfoundland, Quoyle tries to settle his family into a very peculiar landscape.  Rebuilding their lives after too many mistakes and blunders, he finds his niche writing The Shipping News column for an eccentric tabloid of a newspaper.  The constant threat and beauty of the sea pounds the shores of the generational struggle to sustain life and to find meaning.  Grim, gritty, occasionally brutal scenes are bluntly and courageously and quite elegantly written.  With an ocean full of secrets and dread, ghosts are easily awakened.  Child molestation, incest, grizzly car and boat accidents - nothing is glossed over.  Long brutal winters, the uneasy alliance with government and maritime authorities, a party gone terribly awry, and murder on a Hitler yacht - still the focus is on the simple good life of a man who loves and cares for his family.  The recorded version rather wonderfully captures the right tones, the despair of a cruel life, the desolation of the landscape and the nuances of dialogue and setting in a way that the reader/listener feels like they are poised on the windowsill of the these lives, as we listen to this lengthy story (11 CDs).<br /><br />The author won a Pulitzer prize for this piece of writing, it is not an easy or a gentle read, but is certainly a captivating and intense and an opportunity to see how lives can change.  I am very now anxious to see if the movie does justice to the story.	2002-09-10

A tale of 3 brothers and their family, told mostly through the eyes of Fenno (the gay son) and Paul (the widowed father) and Fern (who unexpectedly intersects these lives).  I struggled a bit with a certain lack of identification with the distant Fenno, and the meandering plot.  Charm, grace and tension share the pages of this very interesting generational study.  Ms. Glass exhibits maturity as well as a skillful and artistic ability in this writing.  I have to wonder how she developed and understood the Fenno character, who was without a doubt an eccentric and atypical protagonist.	2002-09-05

An escapist trip to Robinson Crusoe island in South America was a bit of a surprise, but it has now been added to my venue of places to visit.  Upon returning to her cottages in the Cotswolds and her adoring cats, Agatha seriously takes up Pilates, determines to studiously ignore her new neighbor and to hypnotize away her cigarette habit.  Mrs. Bloxby, the vicar's wife, is a minor character, but has one line in this book that makes the whole read more than worth while.  As Agatha finds herself in the midst of yet another murder mystery, she dons a wig and glasses and goes investigating.  Despite rude remarks about her age, threats and more murder, Agatha perseveres and (of course) nearly gets killed herself.  How M.C. Beaton can continue to improve on her Agatha formula book after book, I couldn't guess, but I found this one even more fun and even wiser than previous volumes.  Exceedingly clever.	2002-08-27

C. J. Box does an unbelievably good job of getting into the head of a young girl, and presents us with an imperfect and highly believable hero.  Joe Pickett, daddy, husband, game warden, who doesn't quite get everything right no matter how hard he tries.  While the mystery wasn't too difficult to figure out, it was real enough that you wanted to reach into the book and help these folks out.  While the world of outfitters and hunters is not my usual cup of tea, four years living in Wyoming and riding horses every chance I got, should make me qualified to say he got the sense of place just right.  The book design, and integration of the endangered species was far above par, but the editing was poor (effect rather than affect being something I particularly found annoying).  I look forward to more by this author!	2002-08-27

Sharon McCrumb brings Celtic/Gaelic magic and mysticism to the pages of this book, a story very difficult to explain.  Ghosts and genealogy and the mountain folks of the Carolina mountains, merge together in a melodious collage of vignettes, each chapter not flowing into the next, but eventually all merging together for a huge picture.  McCrumb knows her craft and executes it beautifully in this Cosmic Possum of a tale, where I am visualizing Emmy Lou Harris melding into Enya, and somehow it just works.  An unusually diverse and rather delicious mixture of characters, Nora Bridgewater, Sheriff Arrowood, a boy kidnapped from a Scottish Isle, a Country & Western Singer, a cantankerous old man, a Vietnam vet on a mission, a housekeeper/pseudo-daughter and lots and lots of dead folks.  The missing main character/protagonist might right be the music?  This is one of those books that should have come with a CD inside the front cover.  Historical fiction?  A mystery?  Highly original, occasionally downright antisocial, still .... is it a ballad or a book?  Read it and see.	2002-08-27

Told from the viewpoint of a born and bred Yuppie, transplanted Californian, master landscaper, father, husband, and son, the story becomes a pleasant surprise quite quickly.  Feminine nuance and sublety and ever present guilt are humourously overacted.  But important issues are tackled with the tongue firmly in the cheek.  Certainly a bit over the top, but the exciting thing is that Househusband GETS IT.  Lincoln (named after the car in his out-of-touch father's dealership) makes gentle suggestions for misbehaving children (Violet is spoiled, but she's mannerly about it), business affairs for the spousal unit, as well as dealing with a charmingly/alarmingly runaway mama of his own.  And the icing on the proverbial cake are the yummy sounding, healthy recipes laced through the book.  I'm thinking this should be required premarital reading.	2002-08-27

The reader returns to Harmony where once again the author shines up the mediocre and the mundane and turns it into a miracle.  A very sympathetic look into the discouragement of leading a church of willy nilly believers, with one or both feet in the past and blinders on their eyes.  The reader will learn why goal setting and a gymnasium aren't necessarily a good thing for a church, and how a run-away wife and mother can pull people together.  The accidental lottery winners and scripture eggs and yes - gossip - keep things interesting, when life isn't always harmonious.  Believe it or not, there is something for everyone here in this story of a Quaker minister challenging faith and depression.  The well intentioned, as well as the goofier members of this congregation, are kindly and humorously set out in caricatures that leave you laughing or shaking your head (and I'm betting you'll recognize some of these folks).  The Friendly Women taking on the liberal press and hijacking the hospital kitchen was simply a touch of genius.  The gentle people of Harmony occasionally practice the fine art of indifference, but joy and faith, steadiness and kindness carry through.  A thought provoking and profound ending that challenges the reader to come up with their own explanation.  Might giving thanks be more important than seeking the truth?<br />Don't miss Gulley's other warm, wonderful and charming books:  Home to Harmony, Front Porch Tales and For Everything There A Season ... divided into easy to digest chapters for all ages.	2002-08-20

Part new age, part time travel, threads of reincarnation mixed with art history.  While the author presents us with some highly provocative and creative scenarios, he really doesn't \\"get\\" his women characters, whose reality seems to be either the pages of Cosmo or perhaps the fantasies of an adolescent.  Specifically, do you know ANY women friends who think they have a fine butt?<br />Obvious flaws aside, the book did teach me a great deal about Rubens, and I think the story worked in a very peculiar and thought provoking way.

The story twists through the pages like a tumbleweed in a hot Texas wind.  The child Kayla comes of age ... and to an awareness that things aren't always as they seem.  &quot;Mother used religion as a wifely whip,&quot; Kayla observes.  Meanwhile, neighbor Lou Jean washes her hands compulsively.  Families, betrayals, and friendships are never quite as they appear.  Balanced by an inherently nice, although spineless father and a wild and rowdy grandmother, Kayla watches as her family life crumbles and transforms, and begins to see things from a different perspective, while the beautiful neighbor next door spirals out of control.  And her mother changes into ... what?  Full of unexpected twists and turns, the summer Kayla's family moves from Cameron to Rosalita evolves into an ever changing mosaic of emotion.<br />From her depiction of the sticky juice of a ripe peach on a hot day to the portrait of a night of Texas football, Cindy Eppes gives an amazingly brilliant portrayal of a sense of time and place, betrayer and betrayed, and of the heart and soul of a girl coming of age.  An amazing entry in the \\"first book\\" category.  I highly recommend this.	2002-07-30

An amazing addition to the Mitford series, one that left me gasping at one point and re-reading it almost as soon as I finished it.  Once again Ms. Karon presents the reader with the gentle village life of Mitford and the lovable but occasionally cankterous Father Tim, and shows us a gentle side to some very difficult issues.  Far from syrupy, the books in this series manage to tackle some really hard turns in the road without becoming a soap opera - more an approach to life through faith and kindness and devotion.  For some people, this might be a difficult read but the message of thankfulness and hope will guide you through the darker parts.  Life with Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, Puny, Emma, the Turkey Club, Harley, Hessie, Hope &amp; Helene - well ALL the favorite Mitford character, continues to challenge and enrich anyone opening the cover of this truly wonderful book.	2002-07-12

Before the days of antibiotics and birth control, as mules and horses were slowly being replaced by automobiles, the winds of prohibition raced through this country and lives were changed forever.<br />Mixing poetry and passion, Ms. Garlock does an elegant job of showing the dynamics of small town life juxtaposed against the illegalities and moral fuzziness of years of prohibition.  The characters spring right out of the pages, and finding a few old friends from THE EDGE OF TOWN was exciting too.  I would not label this as a sequel, but rather like running into an old acquaintance in an unexpected place.  Excellently researched and emotionally rooted, the fine shades of gray emerge to tell a story of the heart.  While old fashioned values prevail, the author does include some lusty passages and explicitly gory scenes of violence.<br />Readers looking for something of a similar genre might try Grace Roberts Wood's books (The Train to Estelline, Grace, A Place Called Sweet Shrub, Dance a Little Longer) and Sandra Dallas'<br />tales (The Persian Pickle Club, The Diary of Mattie Spenser).	2002-06-29

It is a light frothy read to be enjoyed and not taken too seriously.  Parts of this story are pure fun, some of it is sarcastic to the extreme, and some of it muddles around in circles.  Meg, a single gal ironworker/artist, never really became quite human for me, thought that did not affect my enjoyment of this silly frolic where colonial times meet the computer age.  The cover art snagged me, but the dear pink plastic (actually over-wrought iron) birds were very much in the background.	2002-06-29

The book is hard to read, as the sentences and ideas flow into a tangle of words, sometimes forthright and cuttingly honest and then as illusive and mysterious to grasp as the dry wind that blows through Northern New Mexico.  What little I've seen and know of that region, seems hazily yet honestly etched in this very unusual writing.  Summer Wood gives the reader a glimpse of the desolation, the bonds of family and the struggle for survival and meaning.  Very far away from Hillerman's version of this landscape.  More a symphony of wind and hope and hopelessness and caring.  Twice I put the book aside, for it became overwhelming and I could just absorb so much of the rather poetic cadence and illusive emotion.  I am unconvinced that I truly understood it, but I certainly enjoyed the richness of this read.	2002-06-29

In the 9th Little Goldy Book, Diane Mott Davidson whips up yet another delicious tale of murder, mayhem and dessert.  With some very fresh ingredients (and no substitutions!) the recipe comes together for a very palatable mystery.  Set at the Christmas season, Goldy is dealing with business troubles (again), a Testy Teen (folks, Arch isnt going to be human again for about 6 or 8 more years - DMD raised boys, and I did too, and this is The Way It Is), the incomparable and incredible cooking cop Tom, as well as Marla, Julian, the Jerk, and some of the regulars.  With her skillful whisk, Goldy whips in some wine lore, skiing and snowboarding, and survival as a wife, mom, cook, friend and TV star.  Its an exciting trip to Aspen Meadows, an action packed picnic on the slopes.  The author really outdid herself this time, and  delivered a deliciously unique cozy, that deserves 5 stars in the cozy category.  Once again, Goldy gets it just right.	2002-06-24

Family, heart, soul, southern fiction at its very richest.  Voices from the grave and a meeting of the generations as a family icon passes through this world.  Mortality, as seen through a veil of overlaps and spaces, quirks and characters.  Sunrise, Sunset - flows through the chapters like the water of Mobile Bay.  Bittersweet beauty woven through the pages with language artistic and lyrical.  Confusion and chaos, childhood secrets and the furtive secrets of love and life.  One season following another, and don't forget the devil either. This is NOT a light hearted beach read, although the bay beckons and glimmers and the dunes reflect the dimming light.  The depth and intensity of this book left this reader breathless and weeping.  The characters are as authentic as the Spanish moss and the scent of almonds and are a glimpse in our own humanity.  And, perhaps a literal glimpse into the author's own sunset?  Let me HIGHLY recommend this book, it goes to the very top of the scale.	2002-06-20

Put in a stock of good wine, seafood and especially chocolate before beginning this highly original culinary/antique/vintage/kitschy cozy.  A deliciously wordy dip into a part of the Savannah landscape that Behrendt missed, complete with an antebellum plantation house, an outrageous ex-husband, wonderfully dysFUNctional family issues, and a bit of beefcake.  Weezie is a thoroughly wronged ex-wife, with a business in picking treasure from junk piles.  Living in the carriage house/garage behind the Savannah townhouse she helped buy and restore (only to be booted out of by her ex- and the home wrecking Caroline).  Weezie is managing her life though, until an emergency trip to the bathroom lands her in jail.  Accused of breaking and entering as well as a being a suspect for the murder of Caroline.  This book rejoices the issues of family, good friends, knowing yourself, helping but not judging and keeping your sense humor - as well a glimpse into a historic city.  I found it positively delightful and give it five stars in the beach read category.<br />The mystery does not totally conclude when you close the cover of this book, I'd suggest a dance over to the author's website, where another mystery unfolds.	2002-06-03

The language is as crisp and cool as the Maine winter.  The landscape on the island of Eastport in Washington County, is simply wonderously set out - and is a place I actually was blessed to spend some time last summer.  Having a peek during the chill of winter had me turning up the air conditioning, brrrr!  Jacobia and Ellie are quirkily charming characters, who easily become very real and dear friends.  A fun approach to life and a witty sense of humor come through each page.  The rest of the population seems to be made up of hard working, salt of the earth, good to the bone locals -OR seamy, unsavory, irritating characters (including a loathsome ex-husband who isn't to be completely written off).  Even the animals have their charms.  Well, not the skunk.<br />I will absolutely have to have some more of Jake &amp; Ellie, and thoroughly look forward to a return visit.

While the writing gave glimpses of southern charm, the story itself tettered between sadly funny, whiney, pompous and self absorbed.  Many of the chapters begin with an excerpt from the Book of Common Prayer and the connection mostly eluded this reader who began to find it pointless and pretentious.  Except for the wild night of the Green Duck, Jesse seemed elusive, out of touch, quick to judge and label, but lacking in some human way - not at all a mental health professional I'd particularly trust.  The cookie cutter styrofoam homes of southern suburbia were interestingly empty shells, while the trailer courts and concrete block dwellings offered the real southern heartbeat.  And the wedding of her sister on the Randolph County Fairgrounds was absolutely delightful. I was also enchanted by two absolutely lovely quotes on marriage: &quot;Hell, love's the easy part. It's the rest of it that gets you in real trouble&quot; and (from Jessie's daddy, the secret to a happy marriage:  &quot;I wake up every morning and your mother is there, same as always.  I can deal with that.  Most days, I even like it.&quot;<br />As a devoted reader of Rebecca Wells, Anne Rivers Siddons and Lee Smith, I'd like to see this writer abandon the prissy Jessie and really breathe some of that hot fierce air of the deep South into her next book.	2002-05-16

Can I recommend this book enough?<br />Ms. Siddons' foray into non-fiction is an excellent introduction to the depth of feeling and emotion in the many fine books she has written since.  There is something that touches me on every single page of this year long glimpse into the life of this very REAL lady.  Weather, stepchildren, cats, suburbs, politics, it's all there, along with a delicious slice of Maine and summers on the seashore.  \\"On fast-darkening twilight patios, when you are thrumming with sunburn and clean and still damp from a shower, in fresh cotton and on your second tall drink, it can steal away your workday soul.\\"  I find myself again and again in this deliciously emotional piece of non-fiction. \\"I am a natural if sadly undisciplined and haphazard hostess.\\" \\"Do not go gentle into that good night.\\" Her love of words, her politics, her empathy make for one of the best reads EVER. Please read this, and love it for me?	2002-05-03

Tedious to the nth degree, the self absorbed lives don't deserve to be memorialized in a book.  The writing is stilted and stiff and repetitious.  Short little sentences describing every boring nuance of lives that move slower than molasses.  Dysfunctional families breeding emotionally crippled adults - how original?<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say about the book is that I enjoyed the cover art and the original title.  However, the story is devoid of passion, joy and faith and is one of the most tedious things I have read in ages.	2002-04-28

This book is a very dark peek into lives in England during the U.S. Civil War, and post revolution Austria.  The reader is introduced to three unlikely, complex and generally unsympathetic (all childless) couples.  First we meet Monk and Hester - the gentleman/former policeman without a past and Hester, the altruistic and driven nurse, a former aide to Nightingale, and assistant to the benevolent Dr. Beck.  Then the story shows another marriage - former revolutionaries - the good Dr. Beck and the beautiful, purposeless, addicted drama queen of a wife, also quite an unlikely duo.  Wiggling about in the background are the staid Charles and the secretively buoyant Imogene.  The characters are a study in psychological contrasts, with an envious and judgmental police detective, the shallow but highly talented artist, the dedicated father, the wealthy yet haunted by love older widow, the ego driven head of the hospital and the mysterious Austrian - but while well sketched they never seem to breathe.  Deep passions, emotions and dark secrets haunt this darkly hazy tale of murder, betrayal and unworthy obsession.  It plods along slowly to a rather implausible and hasty climax.  When Elissa Beck and an artist's model are found murdered, Monk - the man without a past - must travel into the past to find answers.  Generally well written, with interesting research, philanthropic motives and an ominous glimpse into compulsion and despair.  However, this dark dirge does not inspire me to read more by this author.	2002-04-27

Jane Heller treats us to a entertaining parody of a story, making equal fun of men and women and their inability to communicate.  Cleverly written with the tongue firmly in the cheek, this book was meant as an amusing introspection of cross-gender communications, marriage, friendships, and true love - with characters that are way over the top (but who you might recognize anyway).  Teaching the Wyman Method of Womanspeak, Lynn Wyman is on the top of the game and believes she has developed the perfect program to enable Mars to communicate with Venus (the \\"cure for the common cad\\").  When her marriage and her business implode, we all learn a little about ourselves - not only the importance of communicating, but also about trust and friendship.<br />Apparently some folks thought this was the great American novel or something?  This is a light hearted beach read type satire - in case you are confused.  A sense of humor is mandatory.	2002-04-23

Idealism and ethics (or the occasional lack thereof?) are laced throughout this volume, but Grisham Justice has certainly evolved.  I liked the cleanly concise book, with the big surprise at the end.  The characters (or should I say caricatures?) were interesting if not totally lovable, and kept this reader guessing as to exactly who were the good guys/bad guys.  The book was streamlined and uncluttered and perhaps there WAS an emptiness in Ray.  The airplane lore and casino environment were fascinating as well as the insight into mass torts.<br />Summoned home to a dying father (the Judge), law school professor Ray realizes he wasn't quite fast enough.  And then he discovers a totally unexpected $3 million in cash - and a brand new will.  The premise is certainly thought provoking.	2002-04-16

And she probably wanders about and no one knows of the mischief, mayhem and murder lurking behind the eyes of the deceptively normal lady?  Once again, Ms. Beaton takes us along to meet the ever unambitious Hamish as he casts about the idyllic village of Lochdubh in the farthest northern part of the Scottish highlands.  Where the people have their charms, secrets and nasty grudges, and there is almost always trouble simmering.  To the usual wonderful cast of characters, the faithful reader meets Hamish's new constable Clary the Cook, the frightful Freda Fleming, Officer of the Environment, Lugs the Dog, a rich Greek reopening the Lochdubh hotel, as well as the Fergus McLeod and family.  Ms. Beaton beautifully communicates a sense of place, a cadence of language and a refreshingly original formula cozy.	2002-04-15

On  an evening of low spirits and hard liquor, the ladies conspire to \\"accidentally on purpose\\" knock off the old girls.  The delightful Ellie Haskell, loving wife to the handsome Ben, mama to the darling twins Tam and Abby, and mistress of Merlin's Court gets the action going when she plans an anniversary celebration for the in-laws -- only to find out that the actual wedding never happened.  Set in the charming English seaside town of Chitteron Falls, this story is action packed, completely over-the-top, full of delightfully eccentric characters and wickedly witty dialogue.  Accidents begin to befall the mother-in-laws, and when one of them dies exactly as dreamed up by the quartet, the saga goes into high gear.  A delightfully far-fetched cozy mystery sure to charm.	2002-04-02

The fantasy takes off as she cleans an office in the museum, and comes upon an antiquity that rips through the fabric (bodice?) of time and delivers her straight into the hands of a giant naked Scot legend named Circeen.  A unique spin on time travel, Lisa retains her twenty-first century perspective as the medieval landscape unfolds.  Lisa desperately tries to return to her ill mother in the oh-so-distant future as the flames of passion threaten to consume both lovers.  The love scenes are lusty and explicit and the ending offers quite a unique twist.  Historically researched - battles, food and dress - I was even able to look up the  plaid on the net.  But not really in the same league as the growing ever-so-tedious Outlander series.  Maybe Galbadon Light?	2002-04-02

Events conspire to span centuries of time for the gigantic and wickedly handsome god in a kilt to  meet the beautifully petite, smart, lonely and misunderstood Gwen.  Misunderstandings abound as the duo determine how to fix the future and the past, and the chemistry actually jumps off the pages as the pressure builds.  Lusty (to say the very LEAST) but also cleverly written, excellent characterization and a wonderful sense of setting all come together for an excellent escape from reality.<br />My only disappointment?

But the tale quickly disintegrates into a soup with too many contrasting ingredients, way too much seasoning, and not enough simmering.  Too many characters are introduced but never fully developed, the lovely British setting is not fully integrated, the gardens and interesting or fabulous homes are barely sketched in - but the action can only be described as willy nilly and inplausible.  This would have been a lovely book for a location map, and some charming English country scenes, and a lot more characterization.  I was disappointed and wondered if this book had been rushed to publication.	2002-03-24

At the Jones family farm on the edge of town, six siblings work with their widowed father and life is a usually joyous struggle of hard work and school interrupted by an occasional baseball game and a weekly trip to town and church.  Slowly it becomes obvious to the recently hired policeman and doctor that there is also a serial rapist in the vicinity.  The storyline of this book is fresh and captivating and quite believable.  The writing is definitely above par as Ms. Garlock exactly gets right the palpitations of young love, the joys, comfort and trials of family life - as well as the darkness that does intrude.<br />Almost a fictional treastise on rape in the early 1900s, this is also a very readable book that is hard to put down once started, with a couple real surprises thrown in.	2002-01-25

Three childhood friends are prompted by unusual events to flee familiar grounds and try an over-the-pond holiday at a most unusual bed &amp; breakfast &quot;near the top of the list&quot; - truly in a class by itself.  There are really five main stories (three generations) running at the same time, yet they are clearly delineated.  Richard Peck seems to really understand the dynamics of women's friendships.  The flashbacks to wartime London are fascinating, and obviously well researched.  The characters are well developed, from the &quot;seen-it-all&quot; and rather magical Mrs. Smith-Porter (with a slightly shady background behind her upright façade) to the individual charms of Les, Julia &amp; Margo and the utterly-lacking-in-charm Kimberly.  The Bed &amp; Breakfast was a thank you from a former lover, and through treasure hunts in the London markets, Ms. Smith Porter has furnished it with lovely, priceless antiques and a certain joie de vivre.  Concisely and beautifully written, the story evolves simply through circumstances that are quite amazing.  Mr. Peck gives the readers a flavor of London past and present together with glimpses of foolish lives, marriages gone bad, lives gone lonesome -- and then tosses in a bit of enchantment to show how things can fade into adventure and novelty.	2002-01-24

Please don't over-analyze Agatha - the charm of Agatha Raisin lies in her utter lack of it. Pugnacious and relentless Agatha loves life as she sees it and changes what does not suit. Her ambition to marry her neighbor James Lacey has been realized but happily ever after has not. This reader has often thought a duplex or the house next door might be an excellent aid to domestic harmony, but Agatha manages to annoy and isolate herself and drive her new husband into the arms of another woman. Or, did she? When James turns up missing, the overly thrifty Sir Charles Firth joins Agatha to solve the mystery. As they chase about the lovely Cotswolds, Agatha and Charles come upon some amazing characters as she investigates and simultaneously handles a successful PR campaign, makes a new rock band famous and raises a bundle for the Carsley Church.<br />Ms. Beaton delivers a light hearted anti-romance-mystery, sketches a wonderful sense of place, some totally odd ball characters, gets the dialogue just right and does it neatly and concisely - with humor and delight. However, the book could have been proofed a lot better. Or is that just an idea for the next book?	2002-01-23

Loved the picturesque flower covered Faerie Hill cottage, the star crossed for centuries ghosts, the ceili and the charming locals (who ALL seem to settle their disputes with a quick punch and then a wee dram).  However, it was all a little too contrived.  The Jude character was an absolute \\"poor little rich girl\\" who evoked NO sympathy, empathy, or believability - I just didn't buy her story.  I also struggled with an Irishman named Shawn (isn't it Sean?) and the saccharin charm of the romance was just way too much for this reader.

Faithful readers will know more of the O'Malley story from A MIDWINTERS TALE, YOUNGER THAN SPRINGTIME and A CHRISTMAS WEDDING - as well as a character from one of my personal favorites, IN SEARCH OF MAGGIE WARD.  Greeley delivers on his love of humanity, his deep seated faith (if not always an endorsement of the church) as well as a healthy dose of politics and some absolutely awesome music.  This is one of those books that I wish had a CD inside!  Before the book is over, the reader has either had a trip down memory lane or a history lesson, and feels a part of the Crazy O'Malley family of amazing women and good hearted men.	2002-01-06

The eternally 30ish Kinsey zips along in her VW in a rainy and cold California November, searching for a missing husband as well as a new office space.  While attempting to untangle a myriad of complications, Kinsey finds herself personally indulging in peril.  Grafton's writing had me smiling once again - I just ADORE Kinsey and her smart mouth and some of her more anti-social ways.  And I covet that tidy apartment, her neighbor Henry and the black dress - but I might skip dinner at Rosie's.  Grafton delivers a wonderful flash-back Kinsey tale, a convoluted crime, numerous surprisingly despicable characters, and a taste of California that isn't all sunshine and surf.  Set in the 80s, this latest story also illustrates just how much computers and cell phones have changed our lives.	2002-01-06

This story was really more a Miss Julia meets the Keystone Cops kind of foolishness, and really found nothing especially interesting this round.  The new family unit of Miss Julia, Hazel Marie &amp; Little Lloyd is interesting, but descended into slapstick this go round.  If you just loved the first Miss Julia, and really need another fix, go for it.  But otherwise, I'd recommend waiting for the paperback.	2001-12-28

I did tune in very quickly to the completely male perspective offered by Mr. Irving.  All the female characters could be made of cardboard - there is no depth whatsoever.  Everything seems to boil down to sex, sex and more (nearly always meaningless) sex and the story goes way out into neverland on this journey.  Patrick Wallingford, Mrs. Clausen and the weird Doctor Dog DooDoo were just a little past eccentric or believable and I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the point of the story was.

Before I finished the first chapter I was snickering and giggling, and I continued to do straight through to the end - and then I started it over again.  An exceedingly fun bit of writing, you'll not only recognize some of the characters (caricatures?) - you might even see yourself.  After The Kranks on Hemlock Lane determine they will just skip Christmas this year and go on a cruise on Christmas Day instead, they find themselves hiding behind the blinds, in the shower, or in the basement of their own home.  Not only will they forgo the \\"burning away their paychecks\\" at the mall, the \\"mindless materialism of our culture,\\" and the Christmas parties but they also (gasp!) decline to decorate.  On Hemlock Lane, the 7' tall rooftop Frostys (\\"made to glow by a 200 watt bulb screwed into a cavity somewhere near Frosty's colon\\") announce the season from the rooftop of every home. But one.  The tension builds as anonymous Frosty cards start arriving and the \\"coerced bribery\\" of the benevolent associations nearly brings them to their knees.  The ending takes a twist, that I'll leave for you to find out on your own.<br />If this clever little book appeals to you, let me also recommend M.C.

Watching the newly widowed Kyra cope with the impishly extraordinary but sadly abused Jesse was pure magic for the heart, as was the fairy tale setting of the famous and accepting family. The dialogue was humourous and masterful; the scenes absolutely painted onto the pages. A commanding collection of characters only underscores Ms. Vale Allen's talent, although some of the very earliest characters all but disappear. The dynamics of the child/parent and parent/child relationships are skillfully (and sometimes quite breathtakingly) addressed. However, for this reader/mother, something went terribly amiss with the entire story when the medical dilemma appears. Without spoiling the ending (as some have done!), this reader could not get past what was presented as a viable choice. While modern medicine does indeed pose certain quality of life issues; I have personally seen that this is one of the arenas where there is so much hope, so many answers. The power of the will to live surely should/could have played into this and made a much richer and more believable statement. There is an interesting shifting in the last pages of this story, as well as the miracle of the parting gifts. But this reader is still struggling with the plausibility of the medical issues and decisions, and ultimately believes the story to be a bit past far fetched.	2001-12-01

The lovely cover made me choose this book - but then - OH NO! - I discovered that not only was it (ugh) a romance, but also had something to do with football (double ugh).  For some (wonderful) reason I stayed with it and then wasn't ready for it to end.  The main characters are, for the most part, a delightfully believable bunch and the interweaving of Daphne the Bunny storyline is inspired and skillfully done.  The main characters of Molly (Daphne) and Kevin (Benny) dive right off a cliff into a world of whimsy, of fun, and of family - but also getting priorities straight.  Not only did Kevin find himself alive and kicking in the Daphne books, I too found some of my friends residing inside too.  For a frothy, bodice ripping type of story, it is amazingly well written.  A couple of subplots are efficiently tucked in and then it is off to the land of Nightingale Woods.  The premise of an infatuation ultimately leading to molestation of the male character is more than a little far-fetched - and not very nice - but builds into a fantasy love story that is clever, if not always politically correct.  The book contains some really graphic love scenes, which are somehow are kinder and gentler and nicer than most.  The epilogue is so creative that it just almost makes me believe again in Happily Ever After.<br />Mamalinda (Melissa the Wood Frog?), who also favors shawls, pearls and tiaras, but not while riding her mountain bike	2001-11-17

Once again the reader is treated to a healthy dose of English village life with the emotionally stunted semi-losers Maggie &amp; Fellworth Dolphin.  In this twenty-second century Cinderella story, Fellworth's tyrant of a mother dies, he finds his dull life absolutely full of surprises.  To avoid a takeover by the Evil Aunt Agnes, the prematurely grey, virginal Fell fictionalizes an engagement to the plump Maggie with limp hair and thick glasses and ankles.  As they turn the cottage from a pumpkin into a home, the two of them are virtually unaware of the magic going on in their lives.  Fell begins to grow a backbone, as Maggie goes from ugly duckling to swan.  But Prince Charming and Sleeping Beauty really don't see themselves (or each other) as they attempt to figure out an ages old train robbery as well as the next chapter in their (up to this point) dreary lives.  The author weaves her magic and once again gives us a spectacularly delectable little book with a couple of characters who we enjoy getting to know.<br />This time of year, I would also HIGHLY recommend Ms. Beaton's HIGHLAND CHRISTMAS, as well as the entire Hamish MacBeth and Agatha Raisin Series.	2001-11-17

Ooops, make that 29.  With the usual kooky cast of characters, the sisters plunge into murder and mayhem for one last time.  But the \\"plot\\" of the story continues to take second stage behind the delightful characters and absolutely amazing dialogue in this charmingly original set of cozies, lovingly and realistically set in the colorful southern landscape of Birmingham, Alabama.  The lovely late Anne George keeps her tongue firmly and cleverly in her cheek as she dances the sisters through their farewell waltz.  Where else do you get English lessons and instructions in proper decorum and manners with a healthy dose of sass?  Or a stranger than appears on your steps to impregnate your niece?<br />The book seems fraught with the author's glimpses of her own mortality.  She didn't really make it to spring in Birmingham, for unfortunately it really was late winter.  Not only am I going to miss the wonderful spirit of fun, I sure am worried about Fred and hope that he doesn't marry Tiffany -- and what will become of poor Woofer and Muffin?  Hopefully the purple  boots will give Mary Alice the courage to go on without her Mouse.  Somehow.<br />Oh!  There is even a bit of a surprise for the reader who will even get to know who really did dirty-boogie with Elvis.	2001-11-17

Deborah Smith is a writer that humbles you with the magic of her words and the feeling they convey.  The reviews seem to bear me out (forgive the pun?) and I am not even certain I can DO a review powerful enough to convey my feelings.

Sassy and playful, like Fanny Flagg's delightful books, but more of an intellectual's look at life, the book passes by the Dukes of Hazzard type mentality, and stands like a beacon on its own.  Cooking, livestock and an amazing house are simply the tip of the wonderful things to come - definitely a book to be read not once, but many times.  From a road kill menu to a swarm of bicyclists to a bed that morphs into a mirror and \\"something like a husband\\" the palette is full and rich with fun and love and the wonderful art of being southern.  This would make a wonderful \\"read out loud\\" book that would leave the audience in giggles and begging for more!	2001-11-14

When did I grow up, why am I suddenly getting old?  That point when you notice that - how did it happen? - my children are my age.  The book delves right into the whys and hows of where we are and the choices that made this journey go this particular direction.  A wild ride, with some fun and some annoying characters - very much like life itself.  The characters are well developed, very real - and in her genius, the author shows us a glimpse of what might have been - warts and all.  Reading an Anne Tyler book allows you to watch someone else falter along the thorny path.  It gives a glimpse inside your own pysche, and the opportunity to really explore the maybes in a thoughtful sort of way - which is the real ending of this book.	2001-11-14

Since I was ready for a trip back to Taos, I really wanted to like this book.  The reviews all look optimistic.  Could I have possibly have read a different book?  Sorry, but this reviewer is going to break the string.  I was hopeful to find some marriage of  the richness and charm of Willa Cather's Death Comes to the Archbishop and Song of the Lark; Mabel Luhan Dodge's Edge of Taos Desert: Escape to Reality; the mysticism and local lore of Tony Hillerman's wonderful mysteries; and/or the southwest of Louis L'Amour.  [All of which I'd easily recommend if you want more of the locale.]  Instead of a lovely visit to the high desert country, we have an irritating protagonist, a hodge podge of ideas that probably could have been used to write an entire series of books and a book that seems like it will never end.<br />Here is a partial list of irritations (with apologies for the length of this review, my usual style is \\"short and sweet\\").<br />While the story bypasses the fascinating Taos pueblo, it focuses on ancient religion morphing into something (possibly sanctioned by the church?), witchcraft, devilry, government secrets, AIDS, the genome project, as well as the lab at Los Alamos.  That none of this comes together neatly is no surprise.  The buckets of blood seemed to come out of nowhere, and certainly didn't seem to be either interesting or worthy of mention as a \\"floor finish\\".<br />The unlawyerly demeanor of protagonist Christy Garcia y Grant, La Dona and Iggy.  The lawyers I've worked with (for entirely too long) would NEVER behave in such an unprofessional and quite frankly silly manner, chasing about with a lack of thought, a lack of logic, lack of regard for their personal safety as well as others, and a total disregard for ethics.<br />Christy Garcia y Grant comes from a family of Spanish speaking locals, and studies law.  But never bothers to learn her native tongue (or correct English, actually).  Although she immerses herself with ancient religious customs.<br />The elderly La Dona shooting \\"across the prow\\" at the driver of the car she is riding in? And then RUNNING from the accident and going home?  Yeah, right.<br />Missed opportunities of setting.  Taos is a enchanting place.  The magic of the high country desert, the mesas and the mountains, the clear air and rich landscape and are only given a cursory glance as this crazy bunch dashes about willy-nilly.<br />The protagonist is simply irritating, with her numerous exclamations, her bossy and unsympathetic approach to others - she is either disoriented or delusional much of the time.  The guests in her bed and breakfast receive little in the way of charm or hospitality, the \\"amusing tidbits\\" and \\"story time\\" seem nothing less than insulting.<br />Finally, did anyone else notice that the issue causing all the murder and mayhem was simply lost in the final wrap up?  Or, perhaps I simply missed something in my race to finish this bizarre book.ms.<br />The elderly La Dona shooting \\"across the prow\\" at the driver of the car she is riding in?

The author apparently had a great time with the story line, and left hanging a number of lose threads that might end up being sequels.  For the money, you get TWO books in one, and lots and lots of Bodice Ripping between black holes.  Almost photographic images of each other, the two stories overlap in a charming way.  The premise was fun, imaginative and smoothly written (though not inspired).  The lusty love scenes were numerous, but enjoyably researched?  Diane Galbadon's time travel books have more magic for me, and The Doomsday Book is the classic in time travel books, but if romance doesn't make you quesy, give these books a try.	2001-10-29

Yes, they are lighthearted, far fetched - and absolutely delicious.  Goldy Bear Schultz, caterer extraordinaire, starts her morning with a bang ... and then proceeds to have the worst couple of days anyone could fathom.  The writer gets the Testy Teen just right (again) as well as the dinner and particularly the scones.  This tale also provides a dollop of stamp collecting, a couple of cups of Elizabethan England, garnished with a lovely castle, a luscious labyrinth and some truly tangy individuals - not to mention a pinch or two of morality and romance.  The pace is fast, but I did miss Marla who is very much in the background, as well as a trip to church with Goldy.  Somehow Ms. Davidson manages to whip up an unexpected variety of ingredients and come out with a scrumptious culinary cozy.	2001-09-15

Coming to terms with the sudden death of a companion, a middle aged Irish immigrant heads back to Ireland, to solve a 150 year old mystery of passion. Along the way, her own personal mysteries begin to unravel. An amazingly candid look at mid-life, romance, where we come from and what it makes and takes of us. As well as a picturesque vision of Ireland juxtaposed against the unglamourous and merciless Ireland of the potato famine and religious oppression. A fascinating and utterly bewitching story that will stay with me always. Some of the best writing I have ever encountered.	2001-09-02

The author has a genius for starting out books with a fanciful statement, captivates us completely, and then exposes all the warts.  In this case a chance encounter in a grocery store (a place few of us dream about) sets off a woman's mid-life crisis.  The main character, Delia, is not always terribly sympathetic and certainly has her flaws - and really seeks only a sense of self, tired of living vicariously through her family.  The writing never seeks to glamorize or entice, but rather to focus our attention on those that surround us in a fresh manner.  From difficult family members and quirky characters - Ms. Tyler doesn't polish any of them up, but instead gives us a story that will render the reader introspective and richer for the experience.  I listened to the abridged recording of this book, which was well read - but I have enough questions that I suspect I will want to follow up with the real story.	2001-08-22

Sixty-ish Southern Sisters Patricia Ann and Mary Alice, come upon a second set of sisters and a variety of local characters as they muddle through the Christmas holidays and - a couple of murders.  From the very first sentence (which completely gives away the authors sense of fun) the reader will be charmed at the writing, at the dialogue and especially the characters.  While the petite former English teacher Patricia Ann drools in the library, and comes up with clues in poetry; the more robust Mary Alice is trying to cope with being Santas sex slave.  Police Officer Bo Peep is just trying to keep order and Bonnie Blue Butler makes another appearance too.  Come along with this pair for plenty of shopping, some wonderful food, a little local art lore and muddling through danger zones- all under the watching, err, eyes of the Vulcan.  I wanted to crawl into the back seat of the car when they were loading up with colorful quilts and Christmas trees on top.  A great way to cool off in Dallas in August.  A fun frolic with a couple of real characters!	2001-08-07

Charming, clever and cute at same time, Meg Cabot takes a totally playful premise and dresses it up royally. The smart, sassy kids with excellent vocabularies, the diabolical grandmother, the totally embarrassing parents, and the hunky Lars all come together in this delightful fairy tale for teens. The prom scene with the most popular boy in the school should be a MUST read for any dreamy princess wannabe. Issues of friendship, self esteem and social responsibility also gently seep through these pages. Oh - and I was thoroughly intimidated by all the algebra in the book. Not all fluff, and Mamalinde would recommend a mama/daughter tag team reading of the book.  It has a lot to say to both, and I'll be sharing this book with Princess Carie (our daughter), the Fair Heather, and the girl friends of both boys.  I borrowed a couple of little girls, loaned them my tiaras, and went to see the movie - which is cute, and the premise is the same, but there are HUGE changes.  So, do read the book and the sequels AND watch and enjoy the G-rated movie and the values it cleverly advocates.  And take a little girl or two, or even a &lt;gasp!&gt; boy!	2001-08-06

Suffering with both asthma a plethora of unsuitable men, Jordan approaches her investigative business with the methodology she learned as a police woman, and with an unorthodoxy that leaves the reader grinning.  She has a double bed sit, and a box of &quot;props&quot; she uses as disguises, a love for jazz, and a love of cooking, as well as a store front cover from which she sells underpriced treasurers - Jordan is truly an original.  When things are not going well, then a trip to the beach or the pier will help. The author does an exquisite job both with the setting and with allowing the reader insight into Jordan.  This is a well thought out, and cunningly developed British cozy with heart beating drama on the last few pages. Enjoy!	2001-07-19

Characterization is shallow or over-the-top, the setting is not well sketched, and the story moves around with too many two-named characters, and not enough fluidity between scenes.  By the time I reached the end of the book, I didn't care who had committed the murder.  I was just thrilled to finally be finished with it.  I was hoping for an exploration of the strengths and wonders of middle-aged friendship, with dashes of gardening lore thrown into a setting that was being steadily beautified.  Something more like Susan Wittig Albert's China Bayles series.	2001-07-19

Not just a tale of a mother-daughter struggle, but a realistic, almost voyeuristic view into the real world of families and friends and living our lives.  A spiritual odyssey, full of important truths that will make the reader reassess their lives, leave them gasping and - yes, shedding a tear or too.  Lives out of control, bad things happening left and right, and still a spirit of hope, of reaching out.  The author exhibits a maturity that doesn't match her photograph, and presents us with a well developed tale with believable, very human, characters in an exquisite setting.	2001-07-08

A peek into people's lives as well as the catering industry (and I KNOW I never want that career, all that washing up nearly left me with dishpan hands!)  The characters are so startling alive, warts and all and the dialogue is simply perfect - this is the storytelling Maeve Binchy does best.  With marvelous glimpses into the lives and homes and events, and the most precocious set of twins you will ever meet.  A plot that meanders in the same way life does, with breathless pain, red faced embarrassment, hard choices and simple wonder.  Binchy's books are like little epics of life, and I think she's breathtakingly brilliant and mature enough to know of what she writes.  I can see most of this happening, and love the tone and the Irish cadence - and the issue of families - sometimes we love 'em - sometimes it's harder - and occasionally impossible.  I already MISS these folks.<br />This is a rough and tumble and exceedingly clever read, very true to life, and I'm recommending it.	2001-05-31

Suspending disbelief and reading for the truth and elegance that Ms. Hepinstall paints with an artistic and poetic prose, I found myself enthralled.  In this story she stunningly and symbolically shows how things usually are not quite what they seem, and how indignity can be dignified with grace and will.  In all of this the focus and rhythm and the pure magic of the Louisiana deep woods enchants as the reader is drawn into a whirlpool of humanity and hope.  The eternal male/female struggle has a unconventional spin, a reality that is overwhelming as it is bewitching.<br />Ms. Hepinstall's The House of Nectar will be available in September.

A fascinating departure from the story telling of Mitford, we learn first hand of Dooley's unvoiced fears, Cynthia's own transition, and watch as Father Tim falls right off the cliff of independence and self sufficiency, and into the valley of late life romance.  The reader will also learn who harbored a secret crush on Father Tim and who was late to wedding!<br />Any lover of the Mitford books will appreciate the glimpses and insights this little book provides, but IT IS a novella, and not one of the long visits to Mitford we have to wait so long for!  Actually, the second reading was more pleasurable than the first, since I took time to savor.  The reviewers seem all over the place here - but mostly divided between those who knew what to expect, and those who didn't.  So read up on the reviews and then virtually visit Mitford...  As befits such a special occasion book, the artwork and layout are exquisite.  Hopefully the volume of Father Tim's quotes will be as beautifully rendered.	2001-05-14

Stephanie has an attitude, car woes, some weird eating habits, a number of really, really, really bad hair days, and actually wrestles with a chicken.  But she really draws the line when Rex, the hamster, is threatened.  Ranger and Joe Morelli take turns leaving Stephanie breathless and/or ticked off, Mama keeps on cooking, Uncle Mo stays missing as the body count increases and the scenarios get wilder and wilder.  The cast of characters crosses all lines, and are absolutely extraordinary.  This book was so action packed that I have to give a lot of credit to the author, for keeping the story coherent and (somewhat) believable.  The scene with Lula and the extra passenger still leaves me shaking my head and snorting.<br />Let me recommend this one, as light and silly and fun.  The unabridged audio is sensational and will have you laughing through the traffic.  The reader didn't quite have enough Stephanie attitude, but was still quite good.	2001-04-16

When the Domestic Goddess moves to town, she not only weasels people out of their family heirlooms, she attempts to abolish slovenliness, high cholesterol and smoking - offering help where it is not wanted.  She and her not-so-perfectly plump hubby open a low-end bed and breakfast, and Trixie continues to stir the plot of discontent.  Constable Hamish MacBeth doesn't seem surprised when her body is inconveniently discovered.  Once again the under-ambitious MacBeth annoys headquarters and the lovely Priscilla, as the red herrings mount in number and the clues point in different directions.  The Hamish MacBeth books are light fare -with extremely clever writing, characterization that can only be inspired, and a sense of place set out so well the reader feels transported.  I highly recommend all the books in this series.	2001-04-16

A ruthlessly researched book that takes the reader along on a caving expedition in New Mexico that is more than you ever dreamed of.  Nevada Barr is a master of setting and landscape, the reader truly feels pulled into the book.  However, the characters and plot seem shallow and not particularly believable.  I listened to the unabridged audio and was absolutely captivated by the cave rescue, couldn't wait to get back to my tape.  The reader (Barbara Rosenblat) is not one of my particular favorites but does an admirable job on voices and emotions.  I would recommend this as a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone going to Carlsbad, or contemplating a caving expedition.	2001-04-15

Read by the author, who has entirely the wrong accent - more midwestern or simply generic, it starts out okay, but then becomes hurried, flat and deadpan.  The story itself suffers mightly from the abridgement.  A cozy needs the subplots and red herrings, but they were so numerous in this abridgement that it quickly became confusiong and rather non-sensical.  I missed the little bits of herbal trivia I've come to expect, the richness of the characters was lacking, and generally I would have to say this audio is a mistake.  Take a pass, and read the book.	2001-04-15

The character development and unusual situations make this book light hearted and fun.  Improbable?  Certainly.  Entertaining?  You bet!  Anne George comes up with some fantastic names for her characters, and etches family and marital dynamics that really aren't too far fetched.  The reader will also learn some Birmingham trivia (mostly about the Vulcan), where to buy fried chicken (the Piggly Wiggly) as well as the universal sign for a possum.

Another remarkably resourceful Texas cozy mystery, featuring China Bayles, former lawyer turned herb shop owner.  China is on a post-Christmas overload, needing some soothing winding down time to consider whether to accept an offer to sell the herb shop, and whether to stick around Pecan Springs with McQuaid and son.  She heads for some solitude at a quiet monastery where the sisters raise garlic.  Full of garlic tidbits and trivia, the plotting is excellent and the characterization clever.  Not only does China immediately find herself involved investigating some odd happenings, she also finds an old flame has moved into the vicinity.<br />Ms. Albert sketches the setting so well, I feel as if I had a brief respite.  And there is an exceptionally fun website for China (and friends) at mysterypartners.com, where you can visit between books.	2001-04-04

While the author sketches the landscape wildly beautiful in its austerity and the book seems very well researched, the characters are somewhat flat and unreachable.  While the writing is fine, the story drags and becomes oppressive.  Tragedy, betrayal, abuse, selfishness and hopelessness abound.  The ending is a bit of surprise, but still grey and dull.  Let me recommend Lillian Beckwith's wonderful books if you are wanting a more upbeat (though hardly glamorized) glimpse of the Scottish Isles.	2001-04-04

The characterization and interaction of characters is exceptionally inspired and the reader really feels she knows these folks before the book is finished - they live and breathe - well, all except the corpse, who doesn't survive the chili tasting contest and who no one is particularly sorry to see go.  While the writing is well above competency, the plot does meander quite a bit.  The chili / chile trivia throughout the book was interesting enough that the spousal unit took heed, and the recipe for cake with cayenne pepper was also a huge success!  I particularly appreciate that not only do I have more China Bayles books to look forward to, but also a very fun website to visit these new old friends.  Not only did I learn a lot about herbs and what you can do with them, I'm also learning about chili/chile and thoroughly enjoying the work of an exceedingly talented and smart writer.<br />If you like books with recipes, and have exhausted this series, let me suggest and recommend WORLD OF PIES (also set in Texas) and the Dianne Mott Davidson books.  And the wilder women out there, might want to try the two Sweet Potato Queen books.	2001-03-19

You've got to love the 60 &amp; 65 year old sisters who are polar opposites, I particular think the dialogue and writing is way above the norm. &quot;Mary Alice giggled. She's 65 years old but she still giggles like a young girl. And men still love it.&quot; .... &quot;`Nice,' I said, feeling a slight slip in my personal reality cog.&quot;  And the audio book a PERFECT marriage of reader and material - I couldn't wait to go to my car, and then didn't want to reach my destination.  From the first lines of this story, which I listened to in unabridged format, I knew I'd found something special.  Anne George manages to touch on just the right formula of family dynamics and occasional insanity, with sisters Patricia Ann and Mary Alice.  The rather convoluted plot takes second stage to the wonderful personalities and characters and the craziness we all have in our families.  From sperm bank babies to aging hippies, mother/daughter issues, and the lovably annoying spousal unit - I'm real excited there are more Southern Sisters books!	2001-03-19

The characterization was dull and lackluster (until the really steamy parts) and the whole book was more than a bit of a stretch.  None of the characters was particularly believable, interesting or sympathethic.  I knew a couple chapters into the book that it wasn't for me, but I stuck with it and noticed a lot of sloppy editing toward the end.  So glad I got my copy from the library, I am very surprised this book came out in hard cover.  Definitely paperback material.	2001-03-12

From there I followed the treasure map to FOR EVERYTHING A SEASON, and then on to HOME TOWN TALES.  This book is labeled: recollections of Kindness, Peace and Joy, and tracks the fruits of the spirit through a series of happy, poignant and sad vignettes.  All of Mr. Gulley's books have charm and sweetness and light - and manage to do so without being too heavily gooey and sickeningly sweet.  This collection of simple and ordinary everyday tales, is truly a celebration of faith and goodness and all the fruits of the spirit.  I have recommended these books to everyone I know, and give away my copies as quickly as I buy them.  For all ages, for all faiths, these lovely books have something to say to everyone who picks them up.	2001-03-05

The author portrays the hardships they encounter through a diary of Maddie Spencer, recently unearthed.  Hardship, infant mortality, betrayal, frugality, drought and loss give a lot of competition to the rag tag Indian threats.  Maddie's strong spirit meets the obstacles and moves on, accepting the dictates of her husband in a very sobering attitude of submission.  Very Cather-ish, the author hits the right notes for the austerity and characterization.  Anyone unfamiliar with the eastern portion of Colorado, should put away visions of a mountainous land, and think instead of Kansas.  Brutally cold or brutally hot, with no trees for shade or shelter - truly an inhospitable landscape.  The reader is shown that marriage was quite a different institution during these times - from Mattie to the Indian bride to the wife used for breeding and labor.  Or...is it?  Somethings do stay very much the same.  This story is not just a tale of the pioneering spirit, but a celebration of women and the sacrifices all have made.  I would never call it a romance novel.  Well researched and beautifully written, strikes a very honest tone.	2001-03-05

Whippy Bird and Effa Commander and their friend May Anna meet as childhood friends, and quickly become the Unholy Three.  The story revolves around the successful careers of May Anna and Buster, and all of their life journeys of the Unholy ones as they continue down many forks in the road.  Whippy and Effa are two unforgettable, completely distinctive characters that the reader just can't help but loving and feeling almost like they are eccentric family members.  Perseverence of the spirit and the triumph of friendship (as well as the betrayal) shine through in this very unconventional tale.	2001-03-05

A must read for anyone who loved the SPQ Book of Love (which should definitely be read first).  Jill Conner Browne returns with more celebration of life and love, complete with instructions and recipes.  Irreverent, naughty and nice too, the down home common sense approach of the SPQs is something to celebrate.  You just feel like a kindly friend is talkin' (sense) to you, and you don't want it to end - well, maybe a break for some Death Chicken and Gooey Bars and Bacon Monkey Bread.  When we can't celebrate the purely good and simpler aspects of life, the SPQs show us how to approach those parts with a sense of humor and no humility.  Prissing, hormones, dating tips and revirgination are just a few of the topics.  The recipes and the advice make this a book to own, to go back to for later study.  Pair it with the earlier volume, and it makes the PERFECT birthday gift.	2001-03-05

Queenie Bean is earthy and child like and with a serene sense of goodness as well as a level headed approach to life and married to a gentle giant, Grover.  When Rita, a new bride and aspiring  reporter, arrives at a nearby farm, she sets everything at cross purposes, but Queenie just loves her anyway.  This gentle book hits some hard topics, seems well researched and kind.  The writing and characterization are excellent and very much in tune with the times.  Makes you wonder how very much we've changed, and how very much we stay the same.  As you set aside this book, you wonder if you are as blessed with supportive women friends, and mourn the community feeling most of us have lost.  You will also look about at the conspicuous consumption of these times with more than a little embarrassment.  Well done and thought provoking.	2001-03-03

Books	5	12	13	N	N	A Journey Through TBI, HMOs and Changed Family Dynamics	Okay, the title snared me, but this little book is not about either mangos or princesses, but rather about traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its effect on the author and her family.  Ms. Crimmins sketches a gritty, brutally candid and knowledgeable tale of what happens when her husband is terribly injured in a boating accident.  I would label this book a must read for anyone dealing with TBI, as well as for all of us who will probably come upon it in some form at some time or another.  &quot;Imagine a world where the library is intact, but the librarian has gone insane.&quot;  When something terrible happens in a family, the dynamics that made that family what it was, can and do disappear forever - and what's left is a far shot from what we bargained for.  The book is not warm or fuzzy or inspirational or spiritual, the characters are not always very likeable, but the insights are very personal and true, from her own admittedly stupid mistakes to simple miscalculations, and the reactions of folks who can't or won't understand brain injury.  Ms. Crimmins not only writes of their personal journey through the maze of TBI, but the entire medical support/non-support systems that are in place and how &quot;Managed Care&quot; is a silly oxymoron that is being sold to us to insure [no] care when we most need it.  The transfer of her husband from the Canadian hospital to the US left me gasping - simply incomprehensible and inexcusable.  The responses of the HMO were sobering and agonizing and maybe even criminal?  Crimmins says &quot;I fantasize about roasting the executives [of HMOs] on a spit, then taking them down and throwing a few Band-Aids and a jar of Vaseline at them: 'Here's the treatment - this is what we've authorized for first-degree burns under your plan.'&quot;  Read this book for first hand knowledge and understanding.	2001-03-03

He thought I was kidding, so I bought a tiara.  While he still doesn't get it, I did move up a notch when I whipped up some of Miss Lexie's pineapple casserole.  I was thrilled beyond measure when a church friend (or should I say Goddess?) handed me this book and said that I just had to be a Sweet Potato Queen.  Well, the cover was amusing, and a few pages into this wonderful book I knew I had received a huge compliment.  The naughty but oh so nice Sweet Potato Queens have wisdom and insight for women of a certain age, and deliver it in such a way as to leave the reader laughing out loud (in between rolls on the floor).  Not a book to read in public, or possibly to share with your mama.  But I've paired it with the latest adventure of the Sweet Potato Queens (God Bless the Sweet Potato Queens!) and found it to be the most marvelous gift to give a friend who already has a twinge of the right attitude.  Interestingly enough, it is NOT a regional tome, since Princess Calamity Joan in NEW YAUWK, said &quot;The book almost killed me. I'd get laughing so hard, I'd start wheezing...and then I couldn't breathe at all...and the tears were streaming out my eyes.  I'm far too 'edgy' to be a Su'thrun Belle...and at first I thought...Nuts, these gals have a p'tiklar hook on this stuff....and then it dawned on me that the words in the SPQ's tome were words I'd uttered myself years ago, usually to myself, sometimes to other knowing women...and that all these 'insights' are more about the women and less about the geographical location....I'll bet my last dollar that there are SPQ's in Seattle and Sitka!&quot;<br />So - push that button and order at least a couple of these valuable books, `cause you are going to want to own it as a reference/cookbook and you are gonna want to share the fun with your friends.

But this edgy, rather mean spirited tome was a mistake for this reader.  The wit (and occasional wisdom) of the author was lacking a certain joie de vivre, that made the book about as interesting and fun as reading a technical manual with horrible language stuck in for fun?  I could NOT resist the title, but if I'd opened it and flipped a bit I would never have bought it.  Oh sure, she make some good points - and I agree with at least half of them.  Probably I'm a generation removed from the author and not exactly the target audience.  But I sure wouldn't want my son taking up with her.  I'll be sending this on to a buddy in New York to see if it is worth getting translated.

Mr. Gulley take Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, and with his easy going charm, small town simplicity and devotion to God, gives us all a spiritual hug. From discussion on prejudices (a time to refrain from embracing) to three things you shouldn't live without (a time to keep silence), there is much that is rich and deep to learn and to celebrate. And officially why Summer is the Very Best Season. If you think this book is not for you, because after all, you are not a Quaker - you are sadly mistaken. Mr. Gulley's simple writings and pleasing commentaries will enrich and delight everyone. I will send my copy on to Auntique Bea (who says of Home to Harmony: &quot;picked up Harmony and in a few pages I discovered anew the charm of the book.

This truly remarkable collaboration is as engaging the second or third reading as it was the first, and the story has aged very well.  Remarkably imaginative and thought provoking, with strong overtones of good versus evil, it is my favorite King book after The Stand.  Young Jack's quest lies on the other side of the country, which he must navigate - either in our world or the second world of the Territories.  Part of the quest is to save the life of his dying mother.  On this reading of the tale, I was more able to enjoy the ingenious expedition and all the nuances along the way, without so much focus on the possible ending.  The concept of twinners and the character Wolf once again completely captivated me, and now I am ready for (and hoping for) a sequel.  (?)

However, this 7 year old book does miss a few things about the future - as in cellphones and e-mail - it was amazing to even imagine our futuristic friends hanging about for a phone call.<br />Aye, the but the sky to the north drops clean snow.  Do not waste yet more time on drudgery, but seek ye solace and comfort with this book and thy hound and/or feline. I would but seek ye Lord of the Manor and bade him some distant toil, and send him thence.  Then perchance thou may partake of tales of distance times, mayhap with a warmed jar of libation and a cheery hearth.	2000-12-31

Despite the interweaving of the Jonah and Joe stories, this is not a gentle read, or even a very sympathetic one.  The first few pages of the story are unsettling, and perhaps a cheap trick on the part of the author to pull the reader into a story that simply does not really make it.  Hayden Reese meets obstacles in his life, but rather than acknowledging them head on with the grace of God, he strikes out at everyone until he only has himself and a mean, lonely existence.  Hitting bottom brings about all kinds of changes in his life, and hopefully there is a message here of hope and grace, if you can get past the hurtful (long lasting) anger.  I was unimpressed and unmoved.	2000-12-30

A rebellious aunt and American cousin come to visit and nothing will ever be the same.  Aunt Isabelle warns the tiny and already dramatic ten year old Aine that &quot;Men ... eat feelings.  They have none of their own and live off other people's.&quot;  As Aine approaches womanhood, ancient childhood fears haunt her, as does the prospect of life.  Her unconventional and unfulfilled  mother equates marriage with &quot;mortgaging your life,&quot; and then makes a very dramatic exit.  As Aine's very difficult life unfolds, the constancy and concern of cousin Rupert Bear for Tigerlily is an inspired touch, but (as in life) happily ever after is more than a bit of a fantasy.  This is a pretty yet dark and multi-layered poetic tale that keeps hopefulness on the horizon, and has a lot to say about families and coming of age.  The author is extremely talented, and the reader will feel pulled into this living, breathing family and the various landscapes.	2000-12-30
US	52573608	RYQRUSC3ATYDU	0745167128	130556118	The Loud Halo	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Come in for a wee strupak	The Loud Halo picks up from the Ms. Beckwith's earlier books THE HILLS IS LONELY and THE SEA FOR BREAKFAST.  This is the third of the series, I read them in order and am glad I did!  The kettle is on the fire, a delightful strupak awaits the reader!  Come into the charmed croft life of the spinster school teacher, milking the cows, gathering the eggs, beachcombing and gathering hay.  The antics of the sheep and cows are much more amusing that than of a miserly English visitor (with a doctor of divinity and not an ounce of human kindness).  The gentle nuances of language keep the reader smiling - &quot;just a dress she inhabited from her granny when she died.&quot;  Or &quot;corp&quot; the singular of &quot;corpse.&quot;  The book also contains a delightful little list of Gaellic translations and pronounciations.  While the story is a delight, significant clouds appear on the horizon - progress looms in the form of electricity and water supply, the 20th century is trying to intrude.  Alas, lady in distress, who might be the companion?  --Silly Old Cailleach Mamalinda	2000-12-07

The charm of the villagers is matched only by the vivid descriptions.  While she learns the Philosophy of Peats, she brings to the village of dour Calvinists the joy and celebration of Christmas.  This is my favorite of the three Bruach books (a book well worth owning!), the author has painstakingly and with an abundance of kindness, portrayed the foibles of the island folks - the lisping Romeo named Hector, the antics of the old men, the gypsies, and cows.  A poignant and picturesque escape.	2000-12-07

One of my favorite quotes says it best: &quot;Old ladies, I have believed all my life, are the highest form of human beings on Earth, the strongest, the most articulate, and the top of the line.&quot;-Roger Rosenblatt<br />Delve into the whys and lives of these lovely women who have lived long lives in a kind of  neighborhood that no longer exists.  These lovely oldsters are people you and I know, people we usually take for granted.  Ms. Ansberry very gently attempts to distinguish these six women into a force we can all understand and cherish.  Recognizing the huge impact they make on all our lives, from girlhood through child bearing to old age - the author paints a picture of a hillside neighborhood held together by faith, responsibility, church, illness, loss, hardship, commitment, concern, joy and kindnesses.  You will be enriched by this read, and never look upon a little old lady in quite the same way.<br />As a middle aged mama, studying the landscape ahead, I was inspired by all of these women, but especially Mary, who &quot;refers to women by their maiden names, though they haven't signed that name to letters since the 1930s.  Deliberate or not, it preserves them forever as a young girl and honors their individuality, who they were before they became Mrs. Somebody.&quot;<br />This book will appeal to all generations and would make a truly lovely gift for someone special in your life.	2000-12-05

Crime journalist Molly Cates dives into the mystery and produces her first \\"true crime book\\" - already headed for the best seller list.  Bronk is now scheduled for execution, and Molly is attempting to write the final chapter in the story for her magazine.  But when the second Mrs. McFarlan is discovered murdered in copy-cat style, Molly begins unraveling the tale she has written and believed to be true.  Mary Willis Walker is a master of characterization and suspense, and uses lots of Texas landmarks.  The interaction between Molly, her daughter and ex-husband will leave you howling; the visit with the governor was so real I felt I was there.  The crazy day at the junk yard is astonishing - to say the least.  Beware this book is not afraid of making political and religious judgments which will be sure to make some folks uncomfortable, but it is a spectacularly well written story and I hugely enjoyed the unabridged audiotape.	2000-12-05

Grandma Mazur is even more of a pistol - and she has a falling out with mama and moves in with Stephanie.  The continuing saga of Stephanie's car carnage, girls of the 'hood, and wonderfully troublesome men will not disappoint, but the reader will meet a wonderful new pet too.  Another bounty hunt, another huge laugh, with the slapstick irreverence that Ms. Evanovich takes very seriously.  You will need to watch where you read this book, for you will be hooting and laughing out loud all the way through it.  If you have not read the delightful books beginning with &quot;One for the Money&quot; - I'd suggest you do that first.	2000-12-05

Mr. Sherwood has the knack of a born storyteller, quickly capturing his reader into his tale.  Landscapes are vivid, the air actually seems to sparkle, characters breathe and become &quot;real&quot; and the fun is mingled with a certain poignancy.  The egg toss absolutely lifted my cynical little heart, as did the visual of the ladies running to the dance.  Step back and focus on what is truly important and you'll find this little book simple enchanting.	2000-11-28

Research and background of island life and the history of the times is realistic.  Grim circumstances for the hardworking folks determined to stay where generations of their family have lived.  They find defeat around almost every corner - yet their spirits come together and hope lurks in even the darkest corners.  From ancient stones to the Calvinist culture that attempts to forbid the music of the isles, Mairi and her harp inspire promise and perseverence, and if the tone is a bit feminist for the highly patriarchal, independent island people, the story is clever and mostly believable. The characters are portrayed with a gentleness and generosity as well as strong spirits, the harshly magnificent scenery envelopes the reader, and the historical references make this book a standout.<br />I just finished Lillian Beckwith's books about the Hebrides (which I highly recommend), and found this glimpse into history totally absorbing and fascinating.	2000-11-28

Dorothy Martin, an American widow with arthritic knees and a penchant for hats, travels with the reader into this cozy mystery set on a dramatic island off the coast of Scotland.  Bright flowers, glorious hiking, historic landmarks, mislaid keys, heavenly meals, a canny cat, travel to the dark and mysterious island of Staffa, even a cure for seasickness, factor into a fun and clever whodunit.  When one of the members of an acrimonious church group is lost and presumed drowned in Fingal's cave, Dorothy senses more than knows that it is murder.  Back at the beautiful island, she puzzles out the numerous motives, as a major storm blows an ill wind across the island.  Better batten down the hatches, this one is exciting.	2000-11-28

If you have been for one of the pilgrimages, you will have a frame of reference, and if not, Mr. Iles does a more than capable job of etching in the backdrop.  This is an action packed story of race and politics, first love and morals.  From the good ole boys intent on their own agendas, a cameo appearance by J. Edgar Hoover, to the over-achiever power females, the story line twists and turns and moves at a frantic pace, but is clever and well thought out.  The characters could perhaps have been a little less &quot;cardboard&quot; - never got to know them well enough to miss any of them.  Particularly Penn Cage's daughter and mother, who may as well have been window dressing.  But altogether, a tough and exciting thriller with a surprising twist.	2000-11-28

Betrayal, cruelty, loneliness, hard work and sacrifice seem like the price tag on life - until something truly dreadful turns into something inspiring and hopeful.  The brothers Grimm have nothing on the magnificent Miss Beckwith, who tells this Cinderella story in a most believable way.<br />If you are not familiar with Miss Beckwith's tales of the life in the Hebrides, I would highly recommend tracking down THE HILLS IS LONELY, THE SEA FOR BREAKFAST and THE LOUD HALO.

Remote and harsh, truly a difficult existence, but mingled with fun and high spirits.  Ms. Beckwith takes just the right tone - no condescension, but rather an unvarnished yet sympathetic portrayal.  Seeking a refreshing convalescence, she is intrigued by a response to an advertisement from an isolated croft in the Hebrides: &quot;Surely it's that quiet even the sheeps themselves on the hills is lonely and as to the sea it's that near as I use it myself every day for the refusals.&quot;  The reader never particularly gets to know the author, but instead quietly lives the village life of this remote island.  Alternatively lovable and bizarre, the locals are sketched with much affection and the language is plainly inspired.  The landscape is very much a part of this armchair travel guide to a very uncommon world view.  I am off to find Ms. Beckwith's other books, reading this story was like finding riches.	2000-11-07

Maybe I was hoping the PMS Outlaws were truly raving, raging, squads of estrogen inspired justice seekers?  Defensible and forgiveable on account of hormomal histronics.  Ms. McCrumb has certainly done better than this.  LOVED Frankie Silver, so I am a fan.  But Elizabeth can stay in the asylum and Bill can stay clueless and Cameron may very well have run away (and I might even offer shelter).

This time Parker really misses the mark, and creates a female character that is simply not in any way believable.  The dialogue is witty (as always) but very un-estrogen inspired.  The plot and subplots are neither very amusing nor sympathetic - which basically leaves a tough Meg Ryan type and a cute dog.  The pursuit of the case is illogical since Sunny has no other paying job; the interplay with the ex-husband is self-absorbed and a little weird.  Parker tries to weave in a bit of Robert Frost (thus the title) which does not really make any sense.  The conclusion is rushed and ends with what is rather a desperate cliff hanger, supposed to keep the reader hooked on this series?  Not me!	2000-10-24

With a distant father, a loving household retainer and a &quot;Loser's Club&quot; who competes daily for the stupidest trick ... Peyton's life needed the sudden reappearance of Cousin Nora. I was a little distressed over the recycled story and I quite frankly missed ARS's middle-aged matriarchs as in THE COLONY, THE OUTER BANKS and UP ISLAND.  However, the writing is simply exquisite (as always) and the pink T-bird on the cover just way too much fun.  About halfway through the book, this reader found the magic and the sense of place I have come to expect.  Peyton as a child is a character you won't forget, Nora is absolutely ethereal.  However, the pagan Nana could have been more in evidence.  Siddons has great talent for settings and characters, her books are for dwelling and learning and (sometimes) seeing things from a new perspective.<br />And I fear that I take deep offense to this novel (set in my own childhood years!) being referred to as &quot;historical fiction.&quot;	2000-10-18

Also a soon to be bride, a single mom, a widow,  former Tupperware saleslady, poker player, not to mention a clever crime stopper - the down-to-earth Sheriff Brady wears a great number of different hats in this book and has a level headed approach to everything.  In the days prior to her upcoming wedding, with her excessively domineering mother and future husband handling all the details, Sheriff Brady handles a couple of murders and a missing teenager plus the loss of her neighbor and helper.  In between all the murder, mayhem, and malicious, mean characters; she works in mama duties, Sunday church, a wedding shower, in-laws (past and future), and deals with sensitive personnel issues.  The mothers of the bride and groom are almost scarier than the villains in this fast paced thriller.  You'll want to behave in Cochise County or this sheriff could sic her mama on you!  Somehow I failed to &quot;get&quot; the significance of the devil's claw, but what the heck, it had an enjoyable read.  Characterization is admirable but did get a bit confusing toward the end; I would have gladly swapped a sub-plot or two for a bit more of the setting, maybe even a desert sunrise or sunset?  This is a fun and spirited story and this reader is delighted to learn it is part of a series.	2000-10-16

What could be more &quot;evanly&quot; than a return trip to Llanfair?  Why the beautiful sounds of the Eisteddfod, of course.  In this third in a series of gentle, clever cozies, the delightful Constable Evan Evans has been strong-armed into joining a rather lackluster local choir to compete in a local music festival.  Into the village moves a famous opera singer, Ifor Llewellyn, wanting a summer of rest &amp; relaxation.  Ifor is also an old friend of the choirmaster.  The choir suddenly becomes viable, the mood in Llanfair becomes somewhat volatile, and the opera singer exercises his artistic temperment.  When Ifor is found dead in the house he has leased, there are no end of possible suspects.  This cozy contains plenty of local color, delightful characters, and stunningly beautiful descriptions.  The &quot;dueling church bulletin boards&quot; were a touch of pure delight.  Constable Evan Evans manages to not only solve the puzzle, but also manages to keep three tender maidens at arm's length.	2000-10-10

Besides the malice of middle age and the malice of a meddlesome superior, [Chief] Supervisor Erskine Powell of Scotland Yard, is bullied into investigating a very odd murder on the moors in lieu of his long planned vacation.  Despicable Dickie Dinsdale desperately deserved to die (sorry, kinda hard to resist), but was it truly the bite of a \\"bloody adder\\"?  Supervisor Powell and Sergent Sarah Evans, find a village full of people with grudges, an environmental terrorist, a nympho half sister, cunning stepmother, and (seemingly?) incapacitated father, as well as a fired and a promoted gameskeeper, and the [Almost Always Evil] Big Business - all seeming to have motives.  Another exceedingly cunning cozy with anthropology, geology and historical references thrown into the mix - as well as the usual number of red herrings.  Plenty of cozy time around the fire in the pub, interaction with curious and occasionally charming locals, and a brief cooking lesson equals a delightful blend of detecting and writing.	2000-10-09

Claire leaves behind an unsympathetic fast life of drinking and waking up beside the wrong person (as well as a rather mysterious dark history) to live alone in an isolated cottage in Scotland.  To my way of thinking, it was far better to endure some of her hardships vicariously, but the isolation and beauty will rub off on the reader, who hopefully won't have to endure a damp, cold cottage or other deprivations.  The author develops the characters in a richly believable manner, and paints the landscape with loving simplicity.  As Claire embarks on her journey of discovery, the reader will have some eye-opening moments and perhaps even an epiphany as well.	2000-10-09

This is a tale of coming home and discovering your history, with plenty of betrayal and love along the way.  Micah Winship, works through a pretty awful childhood and becomes an award winning journalist, when her world collapses and she finds herself called back to Lytton, Georgia.  Ms. Siddons is a Southern writer who can make you feel heat, humidity and actually breath the air along with her characters, who also breathe and live and languish.  Excellent portrayal of the south with well sketched, believable characters.  The story is thought provoking and hopeful.	2000-10-04

I like the map at the front of the book, I love the times of silence in the Big Woods - was very fond of Sullivan's GHOST DANCE - but this one did not really click for me.  The guys I live with hunt, and perhaps it brought me a little understanding - but also reinforced my &quot;this is a silly cave man thing to do.&quot;  A little less than gripping, the self-absorbed heroine of this tale is neither very believable nor likable.  Part Native American, she leaves behind her small children and equally self-absorbed hubby, to hunt white tail deer in the North Woods of Canada. (?)  This has something to do with the suicide death of her estranged father.  (?)  Mr. Sullivan never really succeeds in crawling into the head of his female character, or breathing any life into her -- or any of the other cardboard characters.  If you can accept the mystical, enjoy blood sport, and lots of murderous terror inspiring plotting, perhaps you will enjoy the book.  For me it was simply tolerable.	2000-10-03

Mamalinda's favorite quote from the book was on family being where  you find it &quot;based on spirit, not genetics - the people your soul  connects with, the people who fit in your heart.&quot;<br />This book is  actually multi-generational, directed to young, old and the full spectrum  in between.  &quot;Don't give your future to your past.  Don't look back,  let go of regret.  Love.  Forgive&quot; is some of the best advice in the  world.<br />A quirky complaint, though:  Don't you hate it when you can tell  that whoever designed the cover, had not even read the book?  The Blue  Bottle referred to in the story is set out as in the shape of a log cabin,  but the cover has a more ordinary shaped bottle.  Actually, the cover art  was a huge disappointment, especially considering the artistic slant of one  of the characters.  If you like this book, you'll need to go to Jan Karon's  Mitford series next!	2000-09-04

Actually, I suspect a born storyteller.  The cast of  characters is a most unlikely arrangement - our &quot;Lone Star  Monthly&quot; reporter, involved with policeman ex-husband, a pyscho dog, a  double amputee Veteran, an artist/poet/busdriver, a David Koresh style  fundamentalist lunatic, a nun turned assassin, a homeless alcoholic,  pregnant sorority girl, a requiste number of men in suits and some  incredibly strong children -- somehow it works.  The school bus is  highjacked, and the clock is ticking.  Suspenseful and very believable,  full of Austin area landmarks, thoughtful commentary on religion  (IMPORTANT, if true), and a bit of middle aged romance, this especially  clever novel will not disappoint.  I will definitely hunt down the other  books written by this author.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Note: I really did not  care for the name of the book, which surprisingly evolves from an Emily  Dickinson poem - it seemed trite or silly until I got into the story.	2000-09-03

Good  humored and caring, she introduces us to five people from very different  walks of life, creating a family-type unit to nurture and love each other.  Oscar, Elfrida, Lucy, Sam &amp; Carrie are handling issues of loss,  tradegy, family breakdown, divorce, re-marriage, aging, financial woes and  abandonment when they find themselves sharing The Estate House in a small  village in Scotland at the holiday season.  Pilcher's characters exhibit  the richness and depth and character we've come to expect.  The settings  are lovingly set out, from the cozy village of Diblo to the wind blown  Cornwall coast, to the lochs and mountains of Scotland.  An adventure to  crawl into, to dwell, to breathe, to cry and to hope.  You will want to  just reach into the book and hug these characters, they are so dear and so  believable.	2000-09-01

By the time I was finished I had the Rand-McNally  out and was tracking the travels and imaging the glorious landscape which  is painted with awe by the author.  The research was stunning though I  found the characters are a bit much - attitudes and actions were simply a  little too politically correct for the time period.  As the book sweeps you  into this adventure, the characters become familiar and sometimes dear.  Actually, I was ready to load Bella Mia, Super Dog, into the car, and head  for the wilds.  This book is an odd hybrid - very original.  It touches on  Indian folklore, post-revolutionary war, Quakers, the French revolution,  slavery, women's rights (or lack thereof), romance (almost a bodice  ripper), cross-cultural issues, family, and has characters from other  author's books thrown in for good measure.  Somehow it (mostly) works, and  is quite an interesting read.  Nathaniel Bonner's constant use of the word  AIN'T puzzled (and irritated) me.  It seemed very gratuitous and frankly  odd.	2000-08-22

She settles into a  comfortable hotel in the seaside village of Fryham, to mend her heart and  recover from a hair-raising experience.  Here, Agatha confronts the next  step after middle age, as well as finding herself in the middle of a murder  investigation.  Agatha plunges in with her usual abrasive style, winning  hearts (the wrong ones, of course), making enemies (without even trying),  misunderstood and misunderstanding, and never really knowing where exactly  it is that she is headed.  A terrifically terrifying prediction, a bottle  of hair tonic and a love potion get Agatha in more trouble than she ever  imagined.  This 5-star cozy is sure to charm.	2000-08-18

The  Sisterhood captures the message and the magic of long-time faithful  friendship between women, in a fun and high spirited celebration - through  good times and dark ones.  Artistically composed, this poignant book is  written from the perspective of a ya-ya offspring seeking balance in that  delicate mother-daughter love-hate rivalry, with some serious childhood  issues.  But what a fun time the reader gets to have on this journey with  the wild and crazy ya-yas.  Having a crazy southern mother of your own will  provide a certain intuitive head start, but is not absolutely necessary.  The story is magical, joyful and (at times) heart-breaking.  From a Shirley  Temple look alike contest gone terribly amiss, to racial issues, child  abuse, alcoholism, war, and the dysfunction of every family, it's a step  back in time and place and a journey you will not be sorry you have made.  After finishing the book, I had to listen to the abridged audio - performed  (rather than read) by the author.  The audiobook is distilled into a  sequence of related short-stories and is so bewitching both in its content  and its delivery that you'll feel the glee of the YaYas right inside your  heart, along with the gentle caresses of the Moon Lady - you will truly  become a part of the sisterhood.<br />I would highly recommend BOTH the book  and the audio.	2000-08-18

The tape is read by the author's wife who speaks  soothingly and pleasantly in very slow, deliberate tones with very soft  music in the background.  Each side is about 25 minutes (with an intro from  the author on Side 1) and contains one meditation per side, relating to two  of the Celestine Prophecies.<br />As much as I have enjoyed this tape, I  fully expected to also enjoy the audio of the book - an abridgement that  was insultingly simplistic and poorly abridged - Spirituality for Dummies?

The Hardy Boy goes in search of the spiritual, chasing  all over Peru, one step ahead of the evil Cardinal with lots of (rather  inane) adventure along the way.  Please be warned that the abridged audio  is insultingly simplistic.  The reader does well with the voices, but  over-enunciates, and completely misses any emotion with a sing-song  delivery (same tone to say &quot;United States of America&quot; as &quot;I  was so frightened&quot;)?

Now I know why!  If we could get the  automobile slaves out of the vehicle long enough to even just look at the  pictures in this book, perhaps a dialogue could begin.  Strong evidence  that the suburban sprawl is not working, finely diagramed.  The myriad of  rules and regulations that are designed to protect property values actually  contribute to the Dysfunctionality.  The ultimate obsolescence of the  suburban neighborhood, which will not grow old gracefully given the quality  of the buildings, the traffic patterns and layout, the unsatisfactory and  ugly shopping centers, and the lack of vision on the part of the leaders.  Just slums with no infrastructure.  What isn't mentioned (except in  cursory terms) is the abysmal failure of the inner school city school  districts.  This one issue alone contributes hugely to the suburban allure,  and is so hugely &quot;broken&quot; in many cities that it will have to be  addressed for any real movement to begin.  For this reader, it was probably  a case of preaching to the choir.  This could very well be the game plan  for the future, if any developers or city planners or suburbanites are  paying attention.  Actually, probably ought to put it on audio, so they can  listen to it in their cars.	2000-07-07

The first 150+ pages are a  slow introduction to a collection of rather unlikeable characters.  I did  wonder: why am I reading this book?  But once the action begins, it is as  exciting an adventure as you can imagine - and not wholly unrealistic  either.  The strong side of the characters (some of them anyway) takes  hold, and the scenarios are well researched and plotted and very  believable.  Only thing that would have made it any better was a map, but  can also see why that might not work too.  Never did quite understand the  Charlie character, but General Jessica is my new hero.

Entirely too many characters to keep up with (and none  of them very easy to distinguish from the others) this story is told using  backwoods-Arkansas cliches and put-downs strung together to serve as  sentences.

Beautifully read, pronunciations and pace perfect - seldom do you find a reader so well suited to the words she reads.  10 stars would be more appropriate.  How  can I find words worthy of review of this austere, symbolic tale, that is  definitely not for Pollyanna.  Poetic and thoughtful, the reader delivers  the author's artistic and eloquent words with just the right timbre. The  childhood of Astrid Magnussen is sobering.  Born to an absorbed, dramatic,  beautiful and poetic mother, a mother who is also murderous and  manipulative and completely devoid of a soul, Astrid is plunged into the  darkness and hopelessness of California foster care.  Desperately seeking  beauty and wholeness, only to have it snatched away time after time.  Shot  at, attacked by dogs, molested, pampered, spoiled, or abused - each home  leaves deep scars, both emotional or physical.  The author combines this  poetic mother and artistic daughter into a slide show of images, some  beautifully welcome, some dire and grim to the point of horror. The  poisonous blossom of a beautiful flower, the searing, troubling heat of the  Santa Ana winds, the descriptions are richly sketched.  The fires can  almost be seen and smelled, the acid trip is completely disorienting.  Listening to this book was a rich experience, perhaps more so than seeking  the words on a page.  The lyrics glide across the waters at a stately pace,  and though you might wish to disembark, you are captivated and compelled to  finish the journey.	2000-06-22

A wee fey truck along with Beaton's usual delightful dialogue,  well drawn characters and starkly vivid landscape are only part of the  charm of this story.  The murder victim, is as always, totally unlikable,  the suspects numerous, and the plot twists and turns but never loses its  pace.  Will this be the turning point for the unlucky in love Hamish?

Looking for a perfect Christmas gift?  Put this first on  your list, it will suit all ages (and particularly a pet lover).  And no  need to wait for Christmas - the cool, fresh Highland air and Hamish's  gentle spirit were even able to blow away the heat and humidity of June in  Dallas.

A day after Agatha turns down his advances, he is found dead.  An Accident or a Murder? James &amp; Agatha join forces to puzzle it out.  And Agatha twists the plot from being the pursuer to being pursued.  There were a few loose ends in this story, specifically what would a compulsive gambler be doing with all that money in the bank?  And, why would the vet be vicious? Somehow I suspect it was alliterative license, but do I sense a tendency of Ms. Beaton to perhaps &quot;kill&quot; real-life people she might meet in her books?

Taking a well earned early retirement to the village of Carsley, Agatha tries to adapt her  presumptuous and pushy personality to the cozy and contentious community  life.  Aggressive Agatha is clueless in the deportment department, but  determined to fit into her imagined idyllic retirement at any cost.  And  never imagines that the store bought quiche she enters into the village  cooking contest will kill someone.  Agatha's allure lies in her complete  lack of tact and charm, her assertive aplomb, shrewd intellect, rude  responses, and the little glimpses the reader is permitted of the human  Agatha. The scenery is splendidly sketched, the cast of characters  outrageous but somehow believable, and this middle aged mama's only  complaint is that this book ends all too quickly - but hold on - this is a  series, and more Agatha awaits.	2000-06-06

Will the quiet Cotswold village of Carsely ever be able to live  down this notorious incomer?  Crawl into the beautiful scenery and see if  solving the mystery brings this kooky twosome back together.	2000-06-06

Hamish MacBeth, the unamibitious and unlucky in love Police Constable of village of Lochdubh, finds himself both promoted and unofficially engaged to the cooly beautiful Priscilla Halburton-Smythe.  However, a new  inhabitant of the nearby and slightly sinister village of Drim is stirring  up passions, and Hamish MacBeth is sensing trouble.  The beautiful young  man even tries to romance Hamish's unofficial fianc&eacute;, while the matrons of  Drim flock to the hairdresser and the exercise classes and their men simmer  and stew.  Hamish smells something amiss when a local woman is found dead.  Though it is labeled an accident - where has the charming man disappeared  to?  Who is covering up what?  With a dose of highlands persistence, a  strange pagan child, and a wee dram here and again, Hamish takes his mostly  gentle persistence all around the countryside, despite instructions from  headquarters and contrary to the gentle guidance of Priscilla, who seems to  be more interested in just about anything than a passion for Hamish.  Well  written and sketched, an absolutely delightful cozy.	2000-06-06

Okay, our lady detective definitely has a distaste for the diminutive, but she's pretty cool anyway.  Parker steals  some of the Spenser-familiar locales, the coffee and the doughnuts, and  even a Spenser plot, but manages to do a pretty fresh little story from a  very different perspective.  The dialogue is witty, the plot twists are  clever, the character interaction is charged, there is an marvelous dog in  the action, and plenty of lowlifes and violence.  Some of Sunny Randall's  feminine angst  is  pretty much on target too.  A fun and fast summer read.	2000-05-30

The setting is severe poverty, at the beginning of the 20th century in the rural Carolinas.  Julie is a strong and hardworking,  responsible and mostly obedient teenager - not anything at all like our  version of a teenager. Poverty permeates this story of a year in the  melancholy marriage of a mountain girl of 17 and her 18 year old husband.  Floods, fires, near starvation, joblessness, hard work, victimization, grit  and the pleasures and responsibilities of marriage.  Mr. Morgan really  crawls into the head of a woman in this tale, better than any man this  reader has EVER read.  Julie is believable, uneducated but smart, with a  simple faith - though hopelessness laces through this story from beginning  to end.  There is little laughter or light in this peek into the past, but  simplicity, austerity and wisdom that is enriching.	2000-05-22

Beaton kills off the least liked person for miles around, then turns the ever unambitious Constable Hamish out to solve the crimes, despite the roadblocks of the nasty Chief Inspector Blair -- the boss we  all love to hate.  The Honorable Hamish meets up with a beautiful hacker  and into the police computer they travel.  Solving a myriad of other crimes  in pursuit of the Dentist killer, Hamish MacBeth, the charming  and  ambitionless Highlands police constable, plods through snow, sleet and  perverse characters, getting himself battered and bruised both physically  and emotionally.  Hamish, Seeker of Peace and Quiet, finds himself dashing  about the Highlands in the capricious pre-Christmas cold of the Highlands,  disregarding instructions from headquarters, solving robberies, tracking  bootleggers, investigating two murders, encumbered by a surfeit of  beautiful women together with a few compromising positions.  Davina Porter  does a much better job on these tapes, evening out the highs and lows of  her voice.	2000-05-22

To his credit, Mr. Sanderford does try to crawl  into the head of a female, but (of course) he misses quite a lot.  Well  written, an enjoyable read.  Davenport always solves the mystery, but there  is a lot of mayhem, gore, sex and nastiness along the way, along with too  many bodies to keep count of.	2000-05-19

Spenser is back and headed south.  A amusing mystery with a  kooky cast of characters straight from Faulkner -- but (of course) Spenser  is up to the task.  As always, the witty dialogue makes Hugger Mugger a  crisp, fast, and thoroughly enjoyable read.  Susan makes her appearances,  though Hawk is out of the picture this go-round.

The protagonists are battered, believable members of the baby boom generation, who find themselves having to match wits with a  frightening crew of townspeople intent on cover-up of old crimes, and the  very deepest evil.  Native American religion, a priest up for sainthood,  twisted sex, a psychopathic misfit, and dreams and visions from beyond -  somehow it all seems to work.  The title of this book first captured my  attention, as in the past few months the Ghost Dance has appeared in two  other pieces of my reading: RavenShadow and Garden in the Dunes, both of  which Mamalinda has also reviewed on Amazon, in case your next stop is  Wounded Knee.	2000-05-15

The author writes with crisp clarity and sketches very believable characters, harshly beautiful settings, as well as cleverly solving the crime with  plenty of stops for tea and scones.  In this story the delightfully  under-ambitious and unlucky in love Hamish goes undercover as a drug lord -  with his superior Chief Inspector as his wife.  The outlandish interchanges  and fiascos are occasionally hysterical.  Davinia Porter reads the  unabridged version, and does a wonderful job on changing voice, is mostly  pleasant but does get suddenly shrill and is uneven enough in volume that  it is difficult to listen to her with traffic noise.	2000-05-15

No one is terribly surprised or even upset when the &quot;Nag&quot; is  found floating in the sea, and everyone seems to have a motive.  Truly an  &quot;cozy&quot; - the endearing MacBeth takes us all under his wing for  summertime in Scotland, complete with bad food, lots of luscious gossip,  seaside strolls and devotion to his dog.  The tale twists and turns but  never confuses, works its way to an exciting climax, and even has a nice  ironic twist.  From the roses at the police station, to the sometimes vile  Highlands weather, to Hamish's dogged persistence, lack of ambition and  willingness to give credit to someone else, this series is absolutely  charming.  Davina Porter does an admirable job on the voices and accents,  she just takes some getting used to.  My second Hamish MacBeth, and not  only am I hooked, I think I have a crush on this man!  Apparently Hamish  MacBeth is a TV series on BBCAmerica.  Mamalinda will have to seek this out  as well as the other books in this series.  Highly recommended.	2000-05-09

The characters are one dimensional, the plot a real stretch - with all the murderous and bloody activity and bizarre leaps this novel still comes out  as dull and lacking.  While the beautiful Irish setting and the charm of  the Irish people should provide a rich backdrop, the scenes change too  quickly to be savored.  Even translator Torrey Tunet's fascination with  language seemed trite and contrived; she was stiff and not particularly  unlikeable.  The police were insultingly inept; the debauchery of the  villain was so vile that it didn't even make good reading.  A \\"cozy\\"  wannabe that simply does not make it.	2000-05-08

The reader is very, very good and, like the run on sentences are almost charming, like in the stream of consciousness flow and it occurs to me that this is Stella  moving into my brain.  Stella's attitudes toward marriage are like frank  and on target and really refreshing, and then I realize that Stella also  endorses good things - like, first, get an education, and then, like have a  job, and save and invest money (it also occurs to me that this is hard to  reconcile with Stella's spending habits), but don't forget to take care of  yourself and always look your best, but be discriminating in your choice of  partner, and always, always use a condom, and be mostly kind to family but  like don't take any b.s. either.  Do wish they could have incorporated some  of the music into the background!  Rated R -- it was a little racy for a  Mamalinda, and the language is just a bit harsh (but not gratuitous, used  for \\"processing\\").  Not a tape to share with your mother, or plug into the  car for a family trip, it did bog down at times, but all in all it was  really quite exceptional.	2000-05-05

Set during the Great Depression in the bleak, gnarled landscape and drought of West Texas, the characters Josh &amp;  Lucy, now with a 4 year old son, settle into their jobs in a troubled  school.  The deprivation and desperation of the depression sweep over the  reader on almost every page, but the high spirited, high minded scholars  meet each challenge as it  tumbles into the schoolyard.  The characters are  sketched with a light and usually loving hand, and the situations are not  sugar-coated but realistic and often harsh.  The &quot;West  Texas-isms&quot; are accurate and amusing.  The book moves quickly to a  ending that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.  And completely true to  this reader's experience.	2000-05-04

A lively 18 year old has adventures no one could quite imagine when she leaves behind her sheltered existence to teach school out in the  dust, wind, and sun parched plains of West Texas.  For every step taken  forward, Lucinda Eliza Richards becomes aware of the detours the must take  to get there.  Nature and humanity are ruthless and capricious and the  plethora of obstacles and hardship is occasionally overwhelming.  A very  frank and fair look into these lives and times.  Well written and honest.	2000-05-03

Between werewolf disease, Marino's resurrection theory, drug cartels, Loony Little Lucy, weak and bizarre political manuevering,  internet body-snatching (and a coroner's office uses AOL, come on!),  walk-ons by a Senator and Interpol, and a baffling trip to France on the  Concorde, Ms. Cornwell has effectively killed Dr. Scarpetta for this  reader, who just assumes this is some sort of mid-life nightmare?

Look at the cover, and you suspect it might be a little syrupy.  It certainly starts out that way.  But the writing is intriguing and the  characters begin to show a surprising depth.  The emerging rights of women  are delicately addressed together with the civil wrongs of the era.  The  characters surprise us from time to time, the goodness of Queenie, the  shallowness of Edna and Bob, the gentleness and persistence of Josh.  And  Mama with her talking without moving her lips, is a high-spirited throw  back to the prim and proper and occasionally clueless era.  The reader is  left hanging at the end, in particular the whereabouts of Jeremiah and  Keats - we can only hope?  In the meantime, I am headed for the library to  find more by this author.

The author uses impartial and even handed brush strokes to describe the war within the man and the richness of the red road vs. the poverty of the reservation, and the nearly impossible  campaign for balance.  The struggles and lapses are well chronicled, as are  the historical references.  Glimpses of humor, and thoughtful and  deliberate weaving of facts, make this a bit more than just a novel.  Thought provoking and intense, this reader was enriched by the experience.	2000-04-24

I listened to the recorded books version,  read by Davina Porter who does an admirable job on the voices, but  can  suddenly become shrill and strident, not the best car companion.

Nor should anyone rely upon Elizabeth MacPherson's detective skills - it takes 3 murders, a pseudo-suicide and several casualities  before she solves the mystery.  Furthermore, the Elizabeth/Cameron  &quot;romance&quot; looks like a dysfunctional family prototype.  But, if  you take the lighthearted fare as offered, it's still an enjoyable journey  and a pretty good read.  The unabridged audio recording (read by Davinia  Porter and Ian Stuart) doesn't quite do the trick, Elizabeth with a British  accent? Mr. Stuart seems clueless, but with little or no charm at all.  Somewhat strident in tone, and not a particularly good pairing of readers  and books.	2000-04-16

Some of the dialogue is magnificient, though the characters and plot do rather muddle at times, and the ending is rather too much all at once  (but then life can be too).

This would not be a good introduction to audio books, though.

What begins at a genteel and well bred pace, slowly tunnels into the very darkest places and emotions, and made the journey  virtually endless.  Lynley and Havers (and Winnie) take the reader into the  world of Scotland Yard and the most unsavory characters (including those  you might least expect).  The writing is impressive, the characterization  is excellent, and the reader is placed right in the midst of the  investigation.  But all in all the story is devoid of hope -- very, very  dark.  Not having previously read any of Ms. George's book, I think I'll  stop here, for it was a bit too realistic for me.	2000-04-10

John McDonough reads these  books wonderfully, though I recommend the books themselves for the lovely  quotes and thoughtful passages to savor.  This book is the first of the  series, and introduces us to Father Tim and the assortment of delightful  characters that make up the North Carolina mountain town of Mitford.  A  gentle reminder of what is truly important, and likely the first of many of  Ms. Karon's books you will seek.

Visually stunning: the  well dressed little Indian with the parrot on her shoulder and the monkey  holding her hand; ancient stones and mists of Bath; lusty sun soaked  gardens of Italy; the clay painted Indian dancers; a hammock on a boat in  the Amazon;  the high spirited Hattie; the self-absorbed Edward; all the  magnificent gardens -- how on earth does Silko make the transitions in such  a believable manner?  Yes, of course, the author has an agenda, and  magically shows us a version of what she considers important.

Although I enjoyed it the first time in hard back (before \\"O\\" selected it) I also snatched up the recorded version, despite the abridgement.  The reader is excellent, though  Kate Binchy is still my favorite, with mild Irish tones and smooth  transitions between characters.  The abridgement was done with surgical  skill - I was aware of the missing pieces, but the story never suffered for  it.  This would be an excellent introduction to Books on Tape, as well to  the human foibles that Maeve Binchy writes so kindly and sincerely about.  This author has a magic to showing the reader what makes each character  &quot;tick&quot; and assuring us all that we can be lovable despite  ourselves.	2000-02-11

Never any doubt that this \\"thriller\\" was simply a story, a stretch of the  author's imagination, a soapbox to issue social commentary.  The clever pet  doesn't quite save the day, but does deposit a special bit of humanity.  Dialogue is fraught with cliches, repartee is just a bit too cute.  Missing the magic (and cold chills) of Intensity.  An okay read.  Mamalinda  would love to see Koontz' characters grow up just a little.	2000-02-11

Climb aboard as three generations of the Cazalet family (and assorted relatives and servants) prepare to board the WWII Train that is threatening  to pull into the station.  Many, many characters, some lovable, some not.  The children and their irrepressible adventures and clever dialogue are my  favorite, followed by Hugh and Sybil, who don't quite meet in the station  for trying to please each other.  Of course Grandfather, with his inane  invitations and muddling but very cunning schemes, is a dear.  This series  seems a place to dwell, become one of the family, with the reader being  able to have the perspective of seeing within each character.  No, there  isn't a beginning and ending or \\"plot,\\" but the reader will find humanity  and joy and family.  Volumes 2,3 and 4 await this reader.	2000-02-07

A beautifully researched, supernatural tale of betrayal and intrigue.  Abridgement is okay, reader is smooth and a  bit dramatic, but makes her transitions in a satisfactory manner.  Characters are a bit self absorbed, but who isn't?	2000-02-03

A convoluted and seemingly implausible tale.  Not MHC's best by a long shot, but may have lost a lot in the abridgement, which is pretty awful.  Too many characters (and too many of them lawyers!) and the setting jumps  between New York or New Jersey -- never quite sure. Finally, Bess Armstrong  has a smooth, lovely voice, and excellent pronunciation.  But it's kinda  like listening to the voice mail lady read you a story, hard to catch the  differences in characters, and somehow beautifully read and monotonous too?  THE LOTTERY WINNER (read by Edith Bunker!) was a joy to listen to;  and  The Anastasia Syndrome was a delightfully neat collection - but take a pass  on this one.	2000-01-28

Magic story of friendship and coming of age, magically read by the lovely lilting Irish tones of Kate Binchy.  This writer/reader pairing is the best I've ever come across, and though 12 tapes sounds like a lot, I wasn't ready for the  tale to end.  So glad to note in scanning the reviews that teachers are  assigning this story -- though it is thought provoking for readers of all  ages.  Auntie Maeve paints even the unkindest characters with even handed  brushstrokes, and puts the importance of things in perspective, while  projecting joy and hope in a reasonable, reflective and realistic manner.  Now I'm headed to the video store to watch the movie!	2000-01-26

A vicarious adventure riding the Lilac Bus back and forth across Ireland, only the reader gets to crawl inside the lives of each of the passengers. Maeve Binchy's insights and exquisite writing are perfectly matched with Kate Binchy's melodious Irish tones. You will feel like you know these  people and that the journey has been a special vacation.  This story is the  neatly crafted -- though it does not wrap every thing up in a nice tidy  package at the end (that never really happens in real life)!  Human, full  of hope, humor, faith and caring, but if you want a thriller, look  elsewhere.	2000-01-09

When the daughter asks her elderly father &quot;What are you  going to do, dear, now that you're so old.  You made me sad when you said  your life is like a computer you never found out how to work&quot; I found  myself in tears.  Very moving story, of normal (and sometimes shallow)  people.  I'm looking for more reading by this author.  My mid-life crisis  must be preparing me for the late life angst!	2000-01-04

Foolish and light, but well written with (mostly!) believable characters.  A trip to Aspen Meadows can be dangerous,  especially to your diet.	2000-01-03

Having personal knowledge of all these things, Mamalinde finds that the author has conveyed the  stunning, shattering pain with an unerring accuracy.  However, Kathryn (the  Pilot's Wife) seems wooden and contrived, the only character blessed with  humanity seems to be the Pilot. Well written and thoughtful, but devoid of  hope, faith, or any warmth whatsoever.	1999-12-27

The loss of a child, a daughter, a sister, is realistically achieved (and this reader  knows of what she speaks).  But, hope, love and survival shine through  along with a caring community - despite pervasive racism and achingly heavy  burdens. The funeral of 6 year old Clara was more a painting than a  chapter, beautiful vivid and comforting.<br />A book to dwell in, not an easy,  fluffy read at all.  Right up there with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD - truly  great literature, and hopefully the first of many from this author.	1999-12-27

These two authors succeed in telling a compelling story of real people coping with real issues.  It is sweet, sometimes sappy, but worth a read.  The authors manage to balance the different aspects of life from the  &quot;empty nest&quot; character to the &quot;new mom with too much on  her&quot; to &quot;super mom&quot; in a believable manner.  The writing is  a little flat and uninspired; conversations really could use more editing.  The book does not master the joy or grace found in Jan Karon's Mitford  series.  But I hope they keep trying.	1999-11-08

Warshawski dives head first into a story of intrigue, bad cops, inhumanity of women's prisons and middle age.  Her rough edges comfort us, Mr. Contreras is the adopted daddy we all need, and the high-profile bad  guys are purely wicked in their \\"men in suits\\" way.  A somewhat convoluted  and moralistic tale of good taking a real beating as it triumphs over evil.  Almost sounds like Paretsky has a death wish for Warshawski though, the  author literally beats her up all the way through the book.	1999-10-14

This &quot;end of the world&quot; story is based on the Book of Revelations and is very intriguing.  Don't forget Waco though -- there are other books in the Bible that merit study as well.  The authors' theory of  The Rapture was pretty brilliant actually, though I agree with the other  reviewers who found the characters one dimensional and unbelievable.  Disappointments are:  1) that this was to be a 7 book series, expanded now  to 21 (greed?), each one getting worse and rehashing the early books to  &quot;catch up&quot; the reader who did not read the earlier books (am I  alone in finding this insulting?).  Also, the books are in a (nice) large  print on terrible quality paper and ragged margins, making it look like it  was published by 7th graders.  Ugh.  I'd recommend this book, but  absolutely would not recommend the series.	1999-09-10
