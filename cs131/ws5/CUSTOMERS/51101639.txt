Except that Lakoff's frame doesn't have room for the third option, or for any variations of the left or right that call the parental metaphor into question.<br /><br />Which is, of course, typical of the sort of people who want to ram government down your throat.  But why is *Moral Politics* worth reading?  Well, this sort of book provides good insight into the current socialist - er, \\"Liberal\\" (or are they calling themselves \\"progressive\\" now?) - perspective on depriving you of the ability to live your life as an adult.<br /><br />Considering that most of the conservatives writing on the subject are just as completely bankrupt as the skunks of Lakoff's stripe (I make exception for libertarians like Walter Williams and Tom Sowell, who are accepted as conservative thought leaders but who regularly hold the conservatives' collective nose against high-speed grinding wheels), there is a genuine need for the non-Democrat, non-Republican American citizen (i.e., most of us) to find some sort of intelligible and explicit articulation of the arrogantly contemptuous smothering \\"motherliness\\" of today's left-wing statists.  Lakoff provides the closest thing to an official Democratic National Committee promulgation on the subject, and (like *Mein Kampf* and *Das Kapital*) his writings deserve an honored place on your \\"Enemies of Liberty\\" bookshelf.<br /><br />Just don't buy a used copy without closely examining the pages under ultraviolet light.	2005-08-17

The blend of distilled theoretical information with guidelines, directing `real world' implementation, makes this an extremely useful text for those in the position of developing early psychosis services.<br /><br />The first four chapters orientate the reader to the fundamentals of early psychosis intervention. In understanding the theory, one is driven to act, but then how to act? Edwards & McGorry assist us with defining the focus, components of service delivery, documentation and evaluation, with lots and lots of examples.<br /><br />There is also a chapter on models of good practice. By finding out what is going on in the world of Early Psychosis, it is relatively easy to work out where to position your own service, according to the needs and capacity of an individual area.<br /><br />The style is engaging, from the cover design to the thick, glossy paper (making it a hard wearing text you can return to time and time again), the dot points and text boxes, and the lively and engaging style of writing which speaks with immediacy to the reader. It's a bit like having the information delivered directly and explained very clearly.<br /><br />While comprehensive, this compact text (small and light enough to be read at the beach or in the bath!) does not set itself up as the last word. It provides a rich reference list, as well as electronic means for contacting services and specialist centres around the world.<br /><br />Given that Edwards and McGorry offer us such a helpful guide to developing Early Psychosis Services, one which seems geared to making it possible for any interested mental health service to `have a go', it is surprising to find towards the end of the text, a very strong argument against the development of generalist models of service. Not withstanding this somewhat political section, this is an appealing and highly valuable text for those embarking on the exciting journey of Early Psychosis Service development.<br /><br />This little orange book makes developing a service less like wandering in the wilderness, and more like navigating a complex yet clearly mapped out terrain.<br /><br />Margaret Foulds<br /><br />Co-ordinator<br /><br />Alfred Early Psychosis Service<br /><br />--hich speaks with immediacy to the reader.

This notwithstanding, the parallels are sufficiently robust that the lessons learned in the 19th Century should not be lost in our 21st Century dealings with that portion of the world population determined to murder or enslave anyone who doesn't profess abject submission to their 7th Century theocratic political aspirations.<br /><br />Jefferson was right when he published \\"The Necessity of Taking Up Arms\\" in 1775.

I picked up *How to Work for an Idiot* in much the same way I've added to my medical library over the years, and for the same purpose.  I'm trying to expand my knowledge of pathology, particularly the etiology and epidemiology of disease.  And management in these United State today is definitely a disease.<br /><br />Much as I would like to have enjoyed Dr. Hoover's book, I haven't found much in it that is worth the cover price - or the time spent in reading it.  I marked at the beginning a Major Bad Sign when I saw that Dr. Hoover introduced himself with direct and explicit promises of humor and insight.  As a rule, anyone who thinks that he's so doggone funny that he can boast about the jollity his writing will impart is someone who can be reliably expected to provide less chuckles than the Book of Job.  Better if he had approached the subject with an air of deadly seriousness, and let the idiocies of American management do the job for him,  simply and straightforwardly.<br /><br />In fields of endeavor where results are measured less by bloviation, misdirection, and \\"creative accounting practices\\" - as American business managers have been tracking each other for the past half-century - there are the inescapable marks of objective reality.  In medicine, there are the meetings of the Morbidity & Mortality Committee.  There are tumor board sessions, QA audits, nervous phone calls from your liability insurance carrier.  In engineering, we have Kipling's \\"The Hymn of Breaking Strain\\" to keep us mindful of *The Strength of Materials* and the consequences of irresponsibility.  In the education and careers of business managers, however, we have deceit piled upon deception stacked atop fraudulence teetering on delusion that Tower-of-Babels into an ionosphere of grandiose dementia.<br /><br />With business management - particularly in the big corporations - consisting entirely of megalomaniacs, psychotics, sociopaths, compulsive liars, and dimwits, it's no wonder that in spite of myriad technological advances and skyrocketing productivity among the people who actually do things (ever and always impaired by the suppressive stumblebums who \\"manage\\" them), we live in chronic dread of disaster, with no confidence in prosperity or the prospect of getting and keeping a decent standard of living.  Saying that \\"It's the Economy, Stupid\\" is rather like saying \\"It's the Beer, Lite.\\"  The impact of idiot management is pervasive, pernicious, wide-reaching and earthquake-deep.  Along with their counterparts in the political sector of society - yet another bunch of prehensile, psychopathic, and prevaricative parasites - the ex-Business Management majors whose sprawling drunken bodies we used to step over in the college dormitories every Sunday morning are doing damage to the nation on a scale so vast that it conjures comparison with the Black Death.<br /><br />I had looked to Dr. Hoover's book for some insight on this subject, seasoned with a little of the gallows humor such an issue must necessarily evoke.  Regrettably, I got neither.  Worse yet, for an author with a bunch of other publications in his curriculum vitae, I found grammatical and orthographical thud and blunder every time I turned a page, with the writer of this book on Idiot Bosses - who claims that he's a \\"recovering Idiot Boss\\" himself - demonstrating all the ghodawful prose style so common among the functionally illiterate management clowns who occupy expensive suits with no more content than costly hot air.  Not only was this book written by an idiot, but it was edited by one as well.<br /><br />There is nevertheless a good and proper reason to add *How to Work for an Idiot* to your bookshelf, and I would encourage its purchase and reading to anyone studying the pathology of managerial idiocy.  If you think of it less as a guide to the subject and more as a specimen thereof, it's a proper entry into your own personal Mutter Museum of the horribly deformed.<br />...it less as a guide to the subject and more as a specimen thereof, it's a proper entry into your own personal Mutter Museum of the horribly deformed.    ...	2004-04-28

As a previous reviewer noted, the authors of this work undertake to utter an authoritative text on pharmaceutical market planning without even acknowledging the existence of either industry codes of conduct in marketing and promotion *or* government regulatory agencies empowered to come down like an avalanche on pharma companies whose officers violate the restrictions of 21 CFR 202.1 and associated laws.<br />Throughout the '90s, all the industry ever heard from marketing clowns like Lidstone and MacLennan was that FDA Warning Letters and similar regulatory actions were \\"a cost of doing business.\\"  Some of these arrogant weasels even *boasted* of their derring-do in skating their companies over thin ice, their fixation entirely upon annual (or just quarterly!) P&L figures, while their actions built up vast hematomas of bad blood in Rockville, guaranteeing that those of us responsible for getting the approval of new drug applications (NDAs) had to contend with an increasingly hostile reception from the FDA's regulatory officers.<br />The individuals considering the purchase of this book are almost certainly *not* going to be spending their own money on it.  The cost will come out of their companies' budgets, and they'll be buying it either because they're marketing mayflies themselves (and therefore interested in selling their overpriced services either as company employees or outside consultants) or they're management officers who are trying to make some sense out of the marketing doublespeak they've been getting from such people.  Given those conditions, I enthusuastically encourage the purchase of this book.  With it or without it, the marketing people can't do much more damage than they're already doing, so they might as well eat up a chunk of their budgets with this purchase.<br />You management officers, however, should get their hands on Lidstone and MacLennan's dollop of bumf with an eye toward innoculating yourself against the boilerplate arguments voiced by these destructive elements within your corporate structure.<br />Remember that - like the rats they resemble - it's not what they take for themselves that makes the marketers so deadly to the survival of your company and the pharma industry in general, but rather the damage they do in the process of sucking themselves fat upon your payroll.ating yourself against the boilerplate arguments voiced by these destructive elements within your corporate structure.  <br />Remember that - like the rats they resemble - it's not what they take for themselves that makes the marketers so deadly to the survival of your company and the pharma industry in general, but rather the damage they do in the process of sucking themselves fat upon your payroll.	2004-02-29

It stands to reason, I guess, that Italian-Americans would display a degree of provincialism raised an order of magnitude. Or more. This notwithstanding, anyone reading Schirripa's view of the \\"goomba\\" culture should be warned that it's *so* damned narrow and simplistic as to blow even its entertainment value.<br />Like Schirripa, I'm a late-middle-aged third generation Italian-American. Like him, too, I'm of mixed blood. He's half-Italian, half-Jewish. I'm Sicilian on the paternal side, and my mother's family is an only-in-America derivation from Naples and Abruzzo. The difference seems to lie in the fact that while he's a native of New York City and thus tuned to the peculiar insanity of that malignant metropolis, my family got off the boat and headed for the farm country of South Jersey.<br />So let's correct just a few of the many ghodawful misapprehensions you'll get from reading this scoop of frothy pasta-pot overboil masquerading as a book.<br />(1) Most Italian-American men and women of our generation - and our parents' - are far more American than Italian. My father and several of my uncles spent World War II blowing holes in the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and only my mother's brother, Vito (who went throughout his life under the nickname \\"Pete\\"), spent any time in Italy. His opinion of the folks we left behind barely bordered on the printable, and there's been nothing much to change that overall impression in my family. We're some of the most aggressively *AMERICAN* people on the planet.<br />(2) Contrary to the image presented by Schirripa, the majority of Italian-Americans tend strongly to seek steady employment. We don't wear sweat suits all damn day long, we're not particularly inclined to sport gold chains and pinkie rings, and we don't hang out with mob thugs. Don't mistake Las Vegas and New York City for the real world, or confuse Brooklyn (much less the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn) with the honest-to-ghod America where most of us live and work and bring up our kids.<br />(3) A lot of the \\"Goomba\\" language Schirripa spouts about is simply creolized elements of the dialects - principally Sicilian - of the impoverished southern Italian provinces (\\"il Mezzogiorno\\") from which most of our ancestors emigrated. When an Italian-American drops the final \\"o\\" from \\"prosciutto,\\" for example, it's because that's a fairly common pronunciation characteristic among Sicilians. Think of it as the Italian equivalent of a Texas drawl. My mom - whose milk-tongue Italian was thoroughly Abruzzesi - used to tease my dad about his \\"baby talk\\" Sicilian dialect. Schirripa and his ghostwriter miss this - and a helluva lot else besides.<br />(4) Not all Italian-Americans pledge allegiance to Frank Sinatra. He had a fine set of pipes, and did good work when he was jerked up short by smart producers, but his self-indulgent \\"Coo-Coo-Baby\\" crap gives anybody with any musical sense - regardless of ethnicity - a flaming case of the red ass.<br />I could go on, but why bother? I don't mind that Schirripa's trying to peddle a stereotype, but the reader should know before he goes into this pile of crud that it's not even a decently developed stereotype - nowhere near as funny as it could be, nowhere near as good a depiction of the intrinsic silliness of the Italian-American culture as you ought to be reading.<br />As for Mr. Schirripa himself....

Here we see a superb and economical detailing of the ways in which limited resources were matched against strategic exigencies by commanders whose work can only be described as plain damned operational genius.<br />Here you will find the turning point of World War II in the Pacific.  The battles of Coral Sea and Midway were wholly defensive in nature, as was the Guadalcanal campaign.  It was only in the breaking of the Bismarks Barrier that the United States and our allies truly went over to the offensive, ensuring not only that Imperial Japan could not win the war but that the Empire's defeat was absolutely inevitable.<br />No one has yet done a better job of making this picture plain than has Morison's research and writing team, and here you will find the finest single example of their work.	2003-10-07

As such, I've often been called upon to handle the kids' -- and now the grandkids' -- difficulties with school work.  My eldest granddaughter had been tasked with a summer reading assignment centered upon Lois Lowry's novel *The Giver* (1993), and she brought it to me because she was directed to read it with an adult.  Her mother and both her grandmothers decided that I'm the adult.  Oh, well.<br /><br />To skip forward a bit, as the granddaughter is now obliged to deal with the wad of photocopied work requirements associated with this book, I've been digging through the Internet to find background on this novel, and some sort of insight into the teacherly impulses so obviously behind the pre-packaged study assignments dumped on the poor kid in June.  In the process, I've discovered (to no surprise whatsoever) that there's a massive presence for this horrible thing among the ex-Education majors.<br /><br />Understand, please, that I'm a science fiction fan.  I'm thoroughly steeped in the genre.  I also get my living through research and analysis.  Spotting logical inconsistencies, intellectual sloppiness, and lapses in reasoning is the habit of a lifetime.  I also used to read a lot of children's and young adult literature when my children were of an age to plough through such stuff, and I found much of it well-enough written to be pretty admirable.<br /><br />When I began reading *The Giver* with my granddaughter (who's a bit dyslexic, and needs plenty of help to translate text-on-page into thoughts-in-mind), I kept turning from the contents to the cover, unable to believe that this thing had actually won a Newberry Award.  This book was supposed to be on a par with *Maniac Magee*? Or *A Wrinkle in Time*? Or even a second-place finisher like *My Side of the Mountain*?  Then I checked out the Newberry Awards list, and took note of more than a decade of Major Suckage in kids' literature (to which, I confess, I've paid not a whole lot of attention in the years between my own kids' growing-up and the rise to reading of my grandchildren).<br /><br />\\"Ah,\\" I realized. \\"John Taylor Gatto's *Dumbing Us Down* - with a vengeance.  Of course.\\"<br /><br />*The Giver* falls into a speculative fiction genre commonly known as \\"the dystopia novel,\\" which includes Ayn Rand's *Anthem* (1938) as one of the earlier examples.  To the limitedly literate, Orwell's *1984* is perhaps the best example of this sort of \\"if this goes on\\" procedural, drawing horrible future visions from what are supposed to be lucidly reasoned extrapolations of societal ghodawfulness either proposed or actually in train at the time of writing.  There are many more examples, one of them being *An Enemy of the State* by fellow physician F. Paul Wilson, written during the galloping inflation of Jimmy Carter's idiotic presidency.<br /><br />As a dystopia novel, *The Giver* is an example of Extreme Major Suckage.  It is fundamentally dishonest as speculative fiction, and Ms. Lowry is wonderfully fortunate in that the majority of children today - the victims of \\"dumbed-down\\" government schools - are not customarily exposed to books like Alexander Key's *The Forgotten Door* or the juvenile novels written by Robert Heinlein during his contract with Scribners' in the '50s.<br /><br />(At this point I recommend that the people praising *The Giver* read Heinlein's *Between Planets* [1951] or his *Citizen of the Galaxy* [1957].  Compare Don Harvey of the former book - or Thorby Baslim of the latter - to Jonas of *The Giver*, character developed against character, situation contrasted against situation, context versus context, and consider that not only were Heinlein's books written for kids of the same age as my 12-year-old granddaughter but they hit print about 40 years *before* Ms. Lowry published *The Giver*.)<br /><br />The plenum - the \\"world\\" - of *The Giver* is logistically untenable.  That's a fancy way of saying that it's too damned fragile to survive for any appreciable time as Lowry has described it.  Societal systems of such cloying control, if they were liable to a breach such as that effected by Jonas in the story, would have been ripped to shreds long before the events of this novel.<br /><br />This is an important defect, inasmuch as speculative fiction of both types - science fiction and fantasy - relies heavily upon sustaining the reader's willing suspension of disbelief.  Even with the factitious mental retardation inculcated by government schooling, I don't see much chance that a reasonably rational child of ten or twelve years' age could ever manage to get past the \\"Sameness\\" bilge (*Induced* absolute color blindness? Gimme a break!) much less the total suppression of human ingenuity and initiative needed to preserve the sociocultural stasis depicted in this novel.<br /><br />To put this in context, consider that the average episode of *Spongebob Squarepants* provides a deeper insight into human nature than does *The Giver*.  Besides that, the Square One lives in a fantasy plenum - Bikini Bottom and all the silliness therein - that's actually better thought-out and more tightly integrated than the community depicted in Ms. Lowry's novel.<br /><br />I understand why the ex-Education majors (the public school teachers) like *The Giver*.  After all, it's been \\"machined\\" to death with all sorts of off-the-shelf study points and similar pap to be regurgitated by the luckless student (which means that the teachers can stick it to their victims with about as much thought and effort as an oyster expends in getting his lunch), and it's not exactly an intellectual challenge.  Education majors, after all, are without doubt the dumbest damned people graduating from college (see cumulative US military Stanford-Binet scores on officer candidates according to undergraduate major subject area; the three lowest-scoring categories every year are education, home economics, and physical education).<br /><br />Beyond that, though, public school teachers are the most thoroughly \\"velvet fascist\\" folks in the country.  Think of them as Mussolini's blackshirts with an ostensibly kinder, gentler face - and a better public relations apparatus.  These clowns secretly *admire* the \\"Sameness\\" in Ms. Lowry's book, and love to drown the kiddies in noise about how wonderful Jonas' community would be if only the governing thugs weren't as much inclined to have people \\"released\\" as is the average Texas politician.<br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />...tenable.  That's a fancy way of saying that it's too damned fragile to survive for any appreciable time as Lowry has described it.

Gimme a break!) much less the total suppression of human ingenuity and initiative needed to preserve the sociocultural stasis depicted in this novel.      To put this in context, consider that the average episode of *Spongebob Squarepants* provides a deeper insight into human nature than does *The Giver*.  Besides that, the Square One lives in a fantasy plenum - Bikini Bottom and all the silliness therein - that's actually better thought-out and more tightly integrated than the community depicted in Ms. Lowry's novel.      I understand why the ex-Education majors (the public school teachers) like *The Giver*.  After all, it's been \\"machined\\" to death with all sorts of off-the-shelf study points and similar pap to be regurgitated by the luckless student (which means that the teachers can stick it to their victims with about as much thought and effort as an oyster expends in getting his lunch), and it's not exactly an intellectual challenge.  Education majors, after all, are without doubt the dumbest damned people graduating from college (see cumulative US military Stanford-Binet scores on officer candidates according to undergraduate major subject area; the three lowest-scoring categories every year are education, home economics, and physical education).      Beyond that, though, public school teachers are the most thoroughly \\"velvet fascist\\" folks in the country.  Think of them as Mussolini's blackshirts with an ostensibly kinder, gentler face - and a better public relations apparatus.  These clowns secretly *admire* the \\"Sameness\\" in Ms. Lowry's book, and love to drown the kiddies in noise about how wonderful Jonas' community would be if only the governing thugs weren't as much inclined to have people \\"released\\" as is the average Texas politician.     Yeah, right.    ...	2003-08-23

With the understanding that Gingrich is an experienced and well-read professor of history, I put the reader on notice that the storytelling expertise in this novel (and almost certainly the bulk of the explicit, verisimilitudinous historical knowledge needed to make vivid the characters and the circumstances in which they move) is *NOT* the contribution of Dr. Gingrich, but rather that of experienced and accomplished science fiction author William Forstchen.<br />In science fiction fandom (and fandom very much appreciates skilled journeymen writers like Bill Forstchen), we have a name for the \\"mainstream\\" reader who is essentially illiterate in our genre.  We call such a person \\"mundane\\" (from which, no doubt, J.K. Rowling to some considerable extent devised her wizarding-world term \\"muggles\\" for non-magical outsiders).<br />Anyone who thinks that a history professor turned career politician (no matter how skilled he might be in either professional sphere) without any real fiction-writing credit in his vitae can do the kind of work seen in this excellent \\"alternative history\\" novel - while William Forstchen is riding in the shotgun seat - has no notion in hell about the writing racket, and is so utterly brain-dead about science fiction that he might as well tattoo \\"MUNDANE\\" across his forehead as a warning to oncoming traffic.<br />I give Newt Gingrich credit for not taking himself too seriously (a major flaw on both sides of the nave in the House of Representatives), and for his willingness to put his name and a respectable (though beyond doubt minor) portion of the effort seen here toward the creation of good, thought-provoking entertainment for those who still support his politics in a post-Bubba, Shrub-malaise'd era.  But credit Willam Forstchen many times more for the intelligence, originality, well-reasoned thoughtfulness, and nigh-addictive \\"brain candy\\" that you'll find in this book - an example of alternative history SF at its best.<br />...for the intelligence, originality, well-reasoned thoughtfulness, and nigh-addictive \\"brain candy\\" that you'll find in this book - an example of alternative history SF at its best.  <BR>...	2003-06-07

Allen Smith I could get my hands upon.  The premise: a belligerent, zag-tailed feral tomcat is adopted by an elderly millionaire, gets named &quot;Rhubarb&quot; for his fierce cantankerousness, and inherits an ailing New York baseball team that just natcherally rises to pennant contention under the unlikely circumstances attending upon their change in ownership.<br />With no attempt whatsoever to prettify the character of the most un-Disneyesque animal protagonist in the history of popular fiction, *Rhubarb* tickled the hell out of me back then -- so much so that the dentist thought there was a leak in his nitrous oxide system.  It's worth reading no matter how long it takes to find a copy.  Anyone who can't take delight from this representative slice of America in the '50s is so much in need of a prescription for mood-elevating pharmaceuticals that obliging a patient to read the first chapter of *Rhubarb* and watching his reaction could probably serve as a better assessment of depression than the Beck scale.	2003-04-24

In thirty-six years of reading (and citing) NEJM, I've found that there is no correlation whatsoever between the standards of scientific rigor with which they peer-review their clinical articles for factual accuracy and the politically-charged \\"public policy\\" stuff they publish when the editorial officers of the Massachusetts Medical Society have an axe to grind. Dr. McDowell's 2001 review of this book (quoted in its entirety on this Web site in order to extoll Cook and Ludwig's bogus-from-the-premises-up calculation of estimated costs associated with \\"firearms misuse\\") is a perfect example of the marshmallow gooiness of the NEJM's institutional excuse for intellectual rigor whenever the subject of individual autonomy comes under discussion.<br /><br />By the standards of evidence-based medicine, the analysis upon which this book is predicated *CANNOT* be relied upon as a tool for the accurate evaluation of violence- or accident-related trauma associated with firearms. That same would hold true if Cook and Ludwig were looking at injuries and deaths associated with motor vehicles, toys, pharmaceuticals, power tools, agricultural equipment, or sports activities, and if there were a similar study -- using precisely this kind of analysis -- published on misadventures involving any of these other elements of modern life, the editors of NEJM would sandblast the authors with scathing sarcasm.<br /><br />But because this book is about firearms, and because the Massachusetts Medical Society is collectively incapable of intellectual honesty in their continuing effort to restrict the rights of people to think and act for themselves, Dr. McDowall's review demonstrates precisely how deeply into blatant deceit the NEJM will shamelessly descend.<br /><br />This book is bilge, but I encourage its purchase (along with Bellesiles' even more disgraceful and completely discredited ARMING AMERICA: THE ORIGINS OF A NATIONAL GUN CULTURE) as absolutely essential additions to the library of every defender of individual rights. Such works are powerfully demonstrative of the unspeakable dishonesty of the wretched neurotics who have long projected their unjustifiable terrors into the statute books and courtrooms of America in their campaign to secure a specious \\"safety\\" by reducing every law-abiding citizen to the status of a disarmed and helpless victim.ORIGINS OF A NATIONAL GUN CULTURE) as absolutely essential additions to the library of every defender of individual rights.

I fell instantly in love with the story of Kip Russell and gutsy little Patricia Wynant (Peewee) Reisfeld, who represented to me the essence of that unassuming courage and simple decency to which any honorable adolescent boy should aspire.<br />Other recent reviewers have summarized the novel well enough on this Web site, so I won't recapitulate. I *will*, however, remark on the fact that Robert A. Heinlein is the only writer of my experience to have tucked the proverbial \\"expositional lump\\" into a juvenile novel and successfully delighted the majority of his readers thereby, going on for ten pages -- *TEN* solid *PAGES* -- about the design, maintenance and repair of a vacuum suit, and not only kept the pace of his story but used every lick of that engineering tutorial to strengthen the suspense and enhance the reader's involvement in what happened later to the protagonist, his allies and his opponents. Hellacious writing, \\"juvenile\\" labeling be damned.<br />(Incidentally, youngsters reading this review might like to know that Heinlein was a graduate of the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, and was trained there as an engineer. Pulmonary tuberculosis resulted in his medical discharge from the Naval Service in the '30s, but he gave up a prosperous writing career at the beginning of World War II to join fellow SF writers Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he did much work on high-altitude pressure suits -- what we would call space suits today. As such, Heinlein made a personal professional contribution to the technology that today allows shuttle and space station astronauts to spacewalk in safety and comfort, and his technical expertise is undeniable in the pages of HAVE SPACE SUIT, WILL TRAVEL.)<br />---allows shuttle and space station astronauts to spacewalk in safety and comfort, and his technical expertise is undeniable in the pages of HAVE SPACE SUIT, WILL TRAVEL.) <br />---	2002-11-20

We Need Them For Breeding Stock.&quot;<br />That about sums up the character of the sole negative reviewer on this particular work.  Christopher Anvil's short fiction written around the premise of an alien race luckless enough to &quot;conquer&quot; Earth (and finally collected here by Eric Flint), typifies the *Humanity Uber Alles* problem-solving science fiction beloved of John W. Campbell, who bought and published Anvil's stuff back in the '50s and '60s.  More than any other single person, Campbell was responsible for the transformation of Gernsback's &quot;super scientifiction&quot; into the genre we know today, and neither the whining mamzers of the '60s &quot;New Wave&quot; (especially the soggy *New Worlds* dimwits like Moorcock who've been trying to pass off badly-written fantasy as if it were SF) nor the other proponents of &quot;soft science fiction&quot; have ever been able to appeal to the sort of people who read and enjoy the genuinely speculative fiction fostered by Campbell when he began his editorial career.<br />At a convention some years ago, I recall a neofan asking Jack Chalker how to write science fiction.  Chalker paused for a moment, trying to get a grip on the neo's abysmal depth of ignorance, before replying: &quot;Well, you've got to start reading it in 1952.&quot;<br />And that about sums up the fund of knowledge upon which our preceding reviewer predicates his opinion of this book.  I'm willing to bet that if said putz were asked who Gernsback or Campbell were, he would either gape at you in bafflement or start waffling so vigorously that the air would be scented with maple syrup.  Ghu knows what he'd make of queries about E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith, or L. Sprague DeCamp, or any one of a round dozen top writers of the '30s, '40s, or '50s.<br />Though Anvil's *Pandora's Planet* is certainly dated, it offers an insight into the literary history of science fiction that only a damned fool could fail to recognize and value.  On top of that, it's an entertaining read, certainly fulfilling Poul Anderson's old saw about &quot;writing for beer money,&quot; in that the price of a paperback book is about the same as that of a six-pack of decent suds, and it's the author's obligation to provide the purchaser of his book with at least as much pleasure as might be derived from the aforementioned half-dozen cans of brew.<br />Anvil's work delivers that much at the very least.<br />Note: Looking up the writings of the late Poul Anderson is left as an exercise for the reviewer who came upon *Pandora's Planet* and failed to figure out how to get the pop-top open.istory of science fiction that only a damned fool could fail to recognize and value.

Inasmuch as the prevailing motto is \\"Cooperate and Graduate,\\" classes of medical students will join forces to systematically attack the task of assimilating the vast amount of factual information under which they're routinely buried. Because almost all lectures are taken in common (i.e., the first two years of med school jam everybody into the same classroom), it's possible for everyone to make use of the same notes. <br />Enter the Note Pool. Like the doctors they'll become, medical students approach their work with different aptitudes, interests, and educational backgrounds -- and they *specialize*. If there are five lectures in biochemistry every week, the average class of med students is bound to have at least five members with a background (often at postgraduate level) in biochemistry, and there will be a volunteer for each lecture who will accept responsibility for concentrating attention on a particular day's presentation, bashing the material into cogency, and submitting it for photocopying and distribution to the entire class. <br />Back in the days when we ran off our notes on a mimeograph machine, I was a sort of \\"utility infielder\\" for our Note Pool, filling in when people couldn't make it to class, handling the extra lectures that got shuffled into our schedules, and generally shouldering the extra work that came along. (Needless to say, I became a general practitioner.) Neuroanatomy was one of those one-trimester courses that \\"came along.\\" I got stuck with both of the weekly lectures, and that leads us to a discussion of *Manter and Gatz's Essentials of Clinical Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology*. <br />Bearing a double burden of lectures to cover (while also running the Note Pool's mimeograph machine), I had desperate need of a \\"cheat sheet\\" to help me get at the essentials of this subject, and I found it in a much earlier edition of this book. Lucid, economically written, and perpetually on-point, *Manter and Gatz* enabled me not only to educate myself in the essentials of human neuroanatomy but also to put the material in order for the rest of my med school class. The present edition (reviewed here) is BETTER than the book that saved our collective butt back in the days before Mangled Care, and I would recommend it not only to medical students and the FMGs striving to break into the bleak present practice environment but also to medical writers in need of an inexpensive, reliable, and accessible source of information on this extremely important subject. <br />As the present electoral hoo-haw amply demonstrates, the vast majority of the population certainly doesn't make any effective *USE* of what they're carrying between their ears. This notwithstanding, the silly boogers do have central nervous systems, and it behooves those of us responsible for the medical care of these damned fools to know how those neurons and their supporting structures are organized. *Manter and Gatz* provides that much and more.	2002-11-01

Fehrenbach -- is infelicitous in the extreme. Mr. Wright's work will draw the attention of the serious student of *materia militaria* only to the extent to which it can make a contribution to the compost pile.<br />When I first picked up this well-camoflaged book (with its cover illustration and impressive heft, it certainly *looked* as if there ought to be something substantive within), I thought that I was about to enter upon an experience equivalent to a reading of John Ellis' THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE MACHINE GUN (ISBN: 0801833582; 1975), but attending upon the next aspect of what Ellis had called \\"Industrialised War\\" -- the mechanization of combat operations, conjoining the firepower of automatic weapons and big guns with the armored mobility made possible by improving battlefield transportation technology.  What is found in Mr. Wright's word-processed psuedointellectual borborygmi, however, does not in any way rise to the level of Ellis' work, and cannot be considered of lasting value to anyone except perhaps the individual whose knowledge of mechanized warfare is so poor that this heap of half-digested mulch might seem profound.  One of the remarkable features of TANK is that it takes the author so much paper and ink to say so bloody little.<br />In the words of Ambrose Bierce, \\"The covers of this book are too far apart.\\"	2002-10-31

This having been said, *God's Children* is not his best work of fiction.  The average reader won't like it much.<br /><br />The individual with military training or experience, however, will find it thoroughly respectable for the messages it delivers:<br /><br />First, \\"peacekeeping\\" operations are far more hazardous than the mainstream media (and the politicians) would like the public to understand.  The circumstances in which our troops and the military forces of our allies are finding themselves have been -- and continue to be -- deadly in ways that only someone who has served under such circumstances can readily appreciate.<br /><br />Second, the mechanized infantry squad adapted to ride in and fight from the M2 Bradley is too damned thin for sustained grunt combat operations under presently established doctrines.<br /><br />The first consideration warrants closer scrutiny of the [people] in public office who pass themselves off as \\"statesmen,\\" and that's a job for responsible voters to take up.  The second is something that TRADOC needs to address, possibly by considering the ground component of the Bradley crew as a large fire team, and enlarging the mechanized infantry squad to consist of *two* Bradley IFVs with their crews, making each crew a bit smaller and using the space to increase the customary loads of consumables (ammunition, rations, water, fuel) and ancillary equipment (such as the stuff needed to more effectively bunker-in when necessary).<br /><br />I'm quite glad that Coyle is in the entertainment business, but I would be even more happy to learn that he were suddenly and unexpectedly tapped for an S3 position with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  The messages of *God's Children* need to be heard where they will do the greatest good.	2002-07-12

I recognized the unarguable truth of the Laws of the House of God, and knew the Fat Man and Jo (the Journal Club Maniac) and all the slurpers and sleazebags and \\"physician entrepreneurs\\" for whom I'd spent a year of my life doing scut while salvaging their patients. I couldn't stop laughing through the first half of the book, and then a curious thing happened.<br />The second half of the novel left me more and more depressed, remembering the bleakness and pain of that year, and summoning up the hard lessons I had learned -- and was still learning as a young physician in the first years of practice. It reminded me that no matter what I did, the slurpers and the self-righteous stuffed shirts in my profession were going to win. They were going to keep on degrading and destroying patients and their families, gorging on the increasing wealth being poured into \\"the health care industry,\\" and beating the hell out of decent physicians who actually dared give a damn about the humanity of the people who come to us for treatment.<br />And now, nearly three decades later, the laughs are completely gone and the truth is beyond concealment. *The House of God* is a wonderful glimpse of life as a scutpuppy back in the '70s, yes -- but more than that, it's a prophetic anticipation of the destruction of what was once a pretty decent profession, working to achieve something more than a favorable return on investment.<br />The '70s weren't \\"the good old days\\" by any stretch of the imagination, but who could've believed back then that the 21st Century was going to be so godawfully much worse?	2002-06-25

The *Connecticut Yankee* subgenre of speculative fiction has been around for a long, long time, and I confess that I'm a sucker for every sort of change that's been rung on this set of bells.  It's not just the notion of good storytelling predicated upon a clash of cultures but on the impossible-in-mundania juxtaposition of cultures in collisions that simply couldn't happen without time travel and/or alternate probabilities (see *Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen* and *Lest Darkness Fall* and *At the Earth's Core* and suchlike).<br />I confess that I'm also a sucker for stories with a subtext extolling not only the ownership and carriage of firearms but also the willingness of the private citizen to use such weaponry to protect and defend the rights of those around him, \\"gun control laws\\" be damned for the authoritarian bastardliness they've always been.  Flint takes a wonderfully American attitude toward such matters:<br />(1) Armed conflict is neither glorious and grand nor so utterly horrifying that decent, humane people must be reduced to the status of passive victims;<br />(2) Like bowel surgery, the use of violent force in the defense of human rights is something to be gotten through as swiftly, skillfully, and with as little secondary injury as possible;<br />(3) When paying the butcher's bill, the objective is to end the aggressor's existence, either by sending him to perdition or by making him your friend and ally.<br />I'll not go into much further detail.  As other reviewers have observed, there is a plenitude of discussion about the nature of government and the role of the citizen in a society where respect for individual rights is the first and foremost value.  We'd be a helluva lot better country right now, in fact, if people like the senior Senator from West Virginia were to embody the values of Flint's fictional West Virginia mining town<br />*1632* is a fine, readable bit of work, and people who aren't fond of novels like this one are the sort of folks you shouldn't leave unwatched in the presence of your valuables.le bit of work, and people who aren't fond of novels like this one are the sort of folks you shouldn't leave unwatched in the presence of your valuables.	2002-06-24

Kelton is not a bad storyteller, and he's got a good touch at characterization. The truthfulness of his settings I can't satisfactorily address as I'm unfamiliar with the history of Texas and the Indian Territories at the depicted time, but they seem robust enough. The problem is that the work appears to be no more than a matchstick sketch, without much depth or detail, and these characters -- and the situations in which they find themselves -- really deserve much better. If *Badger Boy* is any indication of the present state-of-the-art in Western fiction, then the writers and fans of this genre are stuck at roughly the same phase of development as was characterized in science fiction by works like A.E. van Vogt's *Slan* (which was published in 1946). Speaking as an outsider -- a science fiction fan who has little experience with the Western genre -- can I ask just why the hell a writer as obviously talented as Elmer Kelton is producing stuff that promises so much and delivers so little? Is it that you Western fiction fans are too easily satisfied, and don't support your writers as intelligently and expectantly as you should?	2002-05-16

Edited and compiled by Eric Flint, and with a foreword by David Drake, this book is one of the best buys Baen has offered in a long time.  In addition to \\"Diplomat-at-Arms\\" (the first-written of the Retief stories, and one of the hardest to find), this compilation includes the entire short novel *Retief's War* (whence we draw the immortal quotation recapitulated above).  Flint did a fine job of ordering the stories contained in this book, and did even more shortly thereafter (including collecting Laumer's adventure stories in *Odyssey* and a non-Retief anthology of *The Lighter Side* of Laumer's work).<br /><br />I grew up reading the Retief stories in *Astounding*, and I'm grateful to Flint (and Baen Books) for having given us the chance to revisit so much of the best of Laumer's stuff in this volume.<br /><br />...	2002-01-17

The Grand Dame of usage among the ranks of the American Medical Writers Association, Edie Schwager has always demonstrated punctiliousness and precision as thoroughgoing as is her charm. A warmly-welcomed and well-beloved member of AMWA's Delaware Valley Chapter, Edie has always been the first person for whom I've looked whenever I've attended any of the Association's meetings. She educates without condescension and is patient beyond belief.<br />Most of us come to the field of medical writing from a technical background, usually having been trained as scientists, health care providers, or allied professionals.  Our compositional experience is generally restricted to communications with peers, and the niceties of precise English usage are not well-appreciated by those of us who scraped through the liberal arts side of our education only narrowly (and that only with the utilization of Cliff's Notes and every other kind of cheat-sheet we could get our hands upon).  Enter Edie Schwager's very nice little book of tips and tricks.<br />If you aspire to a career as a writer in the health care field, this book belongs alongside your copy of Stedman's, right next to your copies of Iles' *Guidebook to Better Medical Writing* and Bob Bonk's *Medical Writing in Drug Development*.	2001-12-10
