NO was released), and I found this to be a fun little volume that takes quick looks into Bond's origins, the novels, the films and the phenomenon.<br /><br />But I really had to wonder how the authors could rate THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN better than ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  I found a few other errors, but this, to me, is the most glaring mistake in the book.<br /><br />In \\"The Girls\\" chapter, both ladies from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE are missing.<br /><br />In the middle of page 170, a quote from Tiger Tanaka is mistakenly attributed to FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.<br /><br />Bottom of page 246: \\"sene\\" instead of \\"sense.\\"<br /><br />On page 259, a sentence reads \\"Bond also appears there to visit the grave of his dead wife Tracy in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE,\\" which is very odd since Tracy expires in the final seconds of that film!<br /><br />I also wondered why there was no mention of Sydney Reilly, the World War I British spy of whom Fleming said, \\"Bond is just an imaginary figure--but he's no Sydney Reilly.\\"<br /><br />(There are books and a mini-series with Sam Neill called REILLY: ACE OF SPIES available).<br /><br />These quibbles aside, this is definitely a handy little volume for the James Bond fan.<br /><br />It's on my Swinging Sixties Spy shelf at home.	2005-09-20

Instead of being generic paperback volumes, each book has an new introduction along with explanatory footnotes and interesting appendixes.<br /><br />Anyway, I finished LADY but had some misgivings about the novel.  I didn't care for the ending because I felt the story just sputtered out.  From what I understand, Lawrence was dying at the time he was writing this, so can anyone better versed in his life tell me if this was a factor?  (Or did I just miss something?)<br /><br />I realize that he was trying to say something new about sexuality, and that the brazen affair between Connie and Mellors wouldn't necessarily end in despair and death, but it felt like a lot was left hanging.  I felt that most of the novel was constructed very well, but I didn't get that feeling by the end.<br /><br />I also now know that Andrew Dice Clay could've scored a respectable country lady if he had lived 100 years ago.<br /><br />I felt that there was a conflict between Connie and Mellors that was only touched on but not played out: she was quite in love with him for his crude way of discussing sex and his \\"tenderness\\" in lovemaking, but he never appeared to feel very deeply for her.  At times, he even sounded dismissive of any feelings at all.  And the vulgar way in which he talked to her hardly sounded like a great lover but more of a disrespectful player, so it was hard to want to see these two end up together.<br />(I also questioned Mellors' honesty at the way he kept turning on and off his accent).<br /><br />I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't put it up with MADAME BOVARY or even Henry Miller's TROPIC OF CANCER.<br />But I will buy the DVD of the English mini-series directed by Ken Russell and check that out.	2005-09-06

How can anyone take time to read a book in Vegas?<br /><br />Marc Cooper's writing keeps moving for a quick overview of Vegas history, focusing on the couple of years after 9/11.  For a book crammed with a lot of info and trivia, I didn't find any chapter where it slowed down or lagged.<br /><br />Cooper writes about his own experience as a Vegas gambler (where most visitors and tourists exist), and chats with a transsexual stripper trying to unionize nude dancers, Blackjack dealers and other older Vegas denizens who reminisce about the Sin City they used to know.  He also profiles the \\"Big O,\\" Oscar Goodman, who first made his mark as a mob lawyer and now acts as the mayor of Las Vegas.<br /><br />Cooper then moves on to listen to professionals working with addicted gamblers and an activist-monk fighting for the homeless, showing an underside to the party.<br /><br />(I think the book would've been more interesting if Cooper had used his investigative skills to take a closer peek at the ultra-rich in Vegas, juxtaposing that with the chapters about the bottom-dwelling addicts and homeless.  At the same time I was reading this book, I also read the latest Vanity Fair article by upper-crust gadfly, Dominick Dunne, detailing a lavish visit to the opening of the new Wynn Hotel & Casino.  It would've fit nicely into Cooper's book, broadening it from the richest to the poorest in Vegas).<br /><br />There are several complaints about Cooper turning political near the end of the book.  There are snide comments about the War in Iraq and the Bush Administration, but the book doesn't turn into a complete political screed.<br /><br />The venom Cooper reserves for an abstinence group meeting near Vegas does interfere with the flow, however.  He talks about strippers, gambling addicts, crazy homeless, mobsters and even mob attorneys while remaining objective and indifferent to any of their messy details--but he completely tears into virgins participating in an abstinence program.  It just about ruins the book.<br /><br />(Also, there are no less than six typos in the epilogue alone in the paperback I read).<br /><br />But this is still a good Vegas read.ing objective and indifferent to any of their messy details--but he completely tears into virgins participating in an abstinence program.

They went to a Methodist conference and were bullied by pro-homosexual members into arguing over allowing gay marriages and such.  After 2000 years, the pro-homosexual members have finally arrived to properly interpret the Word of God for everyone.<br /><br />My parents' church is now wrestling whether to split from the Methodist denomination, and my parents are debating whether to bolt from their own church.<br /><br />It's happening, people.<br /><br />As sad as the decline of America's major denominations is, it is encouraging to see so many non-denominational or evangelical churches growing so rapidly.<br /><br />I don't have a problem with the \\"harsh tones\\" of this book in regards to what liberalism is doing to the body of Christ.<br /><br />Just read the Old Testament prophets when they delivered their warnings to the straying people if you want harsh tones.	2005-07-12

A lot I'd heard of, some I hadn't.<br /><br />As far as the liberals dismissing Goldberg and even attacking him, they're just exposing their own bitterness and intolerance.  They learned from the masters of the Politics of Personal Destruction themselves, the Clinton Administration.  (Pointing out Ted Kennedy's past of womanizing, drunkeness, even criminal behavior that resulted in an empolyee's death--then quoting him as the moral \\"conscience\\" of the Senate, especially on women's issues--is not partisanship, it's just simple comprehension).<br /><br />But 100 PEOPLE WHO ARE SCREWING UP AMERICA can't be so easily categorized or limited as one side's rant against the others.  Howard Stern, who actively campaigned for John Kerry last fall, is right next to Michael Savage, radio's pitbull opposite of Stern.<br /><br />By reading this book, you should realize that the people listed in this book aren't there because of which side of any issue they stand on, they're here because they really, really should've put some thought into how they express themselves.<br /><br />But you'd have to have an open mind to see it.	2005-07-08

The book is bigger than you probably think, so be sure to clear off enough coffee table space for it.<br /><br />And it's stunning.  I immediately looked through it and was thrilled with the frames from all the films included.  Any true fan of Kubrick could not have selected better frames from the films to include in this book.<br /><br />I can see there are mountains of information, reproductions of handwritten notes on script pages, many behind-the-scenes photos I've never seen before.  There's even a strip of 70mm film from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY on the first page (I don't know if every copy of this book will include the strip of film or not).<br /><br />If you're a Stanley Kubrick fan, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />As a final note on the last page, Christiane Kubrick says that she still feels her late husband's presence in her life.<br /><br />His vision and attention to detail is certainly still present--and preserved--in this volume.	2005-07-01

And, since this is fiction, Theroux can weave a mysterious drug into the plot that is fantastic and fascinating.<br /><br />The novel has such an authentic feel that, from reading Theroux's other works, I wondered how much of it actually happened.  The opening travel chapters felt like his nonfiction travel books.  I can easily see Theroux, who grew up and (as far as I know) maintained a residence in New England, appearing at high-powered celebrity parties at Martha's Vineyard.  He even makes a brief mention of growing up at a swimming pool.  The added interest in his works, for me, has always been to wonder whether \\"this really happened\\" or not.<br /><br />BLINDING LIGHT is one of his best.	2005-06-17

At first they're interesting, then repititious and tiresome, then unbelievable.<br /><br />This book was like listening to that guy or girl.<br /><br />Living in a GIRLS GONE WILD era, where just about every girl under 25 looks drunk, tattooed and totally slutty, it's hard to feel there is anything unique about this memoir: beach parties and spring breaks provide daily debaucheries on a wide scale.<br /><br />I also questioned the credibility of this book when it comes to diseases: anyone so reckless would've surely picked up something!  I have friends with only a few party indiscretions who found themselves infected with herpes, so for Ms. Millet to drone on and on about long lines of strangers without a word about any infection at all sounds dishonest.<br /><br />The more she writes of her sexual escapades, the more detached and removed she appears from herself.	2005-06-12

He used to bum rides from the Hare Krishnas and somehow found out that the pick-up truck sent from West Virginia to the Krishna house in Athens was the one mentioned in the first chapter of MONKEY ON A STICK.<br /><br />I picked up the book, saying I'd read but not really jumping into it.  A couple years later, during a serious bout of insomnia, I pulled it off the shelf...and then could not put it down.<br /><br />Absolutely fascinating.  It begins with the prolonged murder of a guy the Krishnas wanted dead, then the book takes the reader on the bad, crazy trip of how the Hare Krishna movement started--at first as a magical, mystery tour by American hippies in the Far East before turning into a drug-fueled nightmare of cult control and sex abuse.<br /><br />Like the former Krishna said in his review: \\"You can't put it down.\\"	2005-05-31

In fact, he's on C-SPAN2 right now hawking his next book and saying things so outrageously deceptive that I'm surprised the stage doesn't crack open and Mr. Press falls into the bowels of the earth.<br /><br />He just said, \\"There are no passages in the Bible condemning gay marriage.\\"  Is this guy serious?<br />The behavior itself would get you killed back then, does Press think maybe a few demonstrations and a petition-signing would help the cause?  In the mind of Bill Press, Soddom and Gomorrah might have avoided getting nuked from on high if they'd only passed civil union legislation.<br />But that's the kind of logic you get from someone like Bill Press: It's not an abortion because it's just \\"birth matter.\\"  George Bush can't believe in God because Bush is the enemy.  Etc., etc.<br />When Press insists that God cannot be on the Republican's side because he says \\"I'm sure SHE's a liberal,\\" you know he's going for a rimshot than for anything requiring any depth or thought.<br /><br />I know they absolutely despise the vicious Republican right-wing attack machine (where can I get a T-shirt?) and blame them for exposing the liberal's philosophy as a complete fraud, but they'll never be honest enough to admit that the liberals--like Bill Press--have done more to discredit the Left than anyone else.<br />It's all right there.

The book read like he was trying to maintain the slick, sexy sheen of the Vegas tourism ads without delving into some of the more tragic aspects of all that sex and drugs.<br /><br />One of my best friends in the world is on the Vegas Police Department, and he could tell you a completely different side of the \\"fun capital of the world.\\"<br /><br />(Maybe a dark, stunning expose could be written about the seedy side of Disneyland.  I don't know.  But I read SKIN CITY and felt like a lot of folks in that book were not telling their whole story.

I liked the mystery with a hint of secret knowledge its reputation held.<br /><br />As I asked around, a pretentious stoner friend told me to save a lot of time and just skip to the chapter where John Galt lays out his 50-page philosophy.<br /><br />Another buddy said he'd heard a professor at the Univeristy of Virginia say, \\"I read ATLAS SHRUGGED...then I shrugged.\\"<br /><br />Twenty years later, I reconnected with someone who'd based her worldview on that book, so I decided to give it a try.  (That's right: I finally made it through the whole thing for a woman.  I'm just glad she didn't ask me to build a pyramid or something....)<br /><br />The book was interesting, but I found problems with it both dramatically and philosophically in the last third.<br /><br />I was into the relationship between Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden...but then they drift apart.  After establishing Dagny as a unique, strong, fiercely-independent woman who falls in love with an equally-tough Rearden, I was a little disappointed when her next lover is a man she has no real interaction with--and comes off as more as a groupie than anything else!<br /><br />I enjoyed the work ethic espoused in Rand's \\"Objectivism,\\" but beyond that it would lead to other evils just as great as the \\"looters\\" and \\"moochers\\" she curses here: where would an Adolph Hitler, a lunatic with the hard-working drive of a Hank Rearden, fit into this world?<br /><br />Ms. Rand's contempt for the \\"mystics\\" (or, in politically-correct terms, \\"people of faith\\") appears to be limited to the most freakish raving stereotypes that most spiritual people also abhor.<br /><br />Am I the only one who noticed that, after reading how the heroic thinkers gun down security guards just doing their jobs near the end of the book--and dismissing them as human for not being able to quickly make a decision (it's there, read it), ATLAS SHRUGGED might only be advocating one form of tyranny over another?<br /><br />Still, I'm glad I read it.

The covers were so cool that, even though I already have all the books, I'm considering buying these new ones!<br /><br />For anyone looking to the original novels by Ian Fleming after watching the films, I would say that they all read completely different from their cinematic versions.  Only FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE come close to Fleming's works, and both the novels and films of those are among my favorites.<br /><br />What I remember from the book DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is thinking that Ian Fleming really didn't have an understanding of Americans.  They were either pin-striped Chicago mobsters or tough-talking Texas cowboys--or in the case of this book, both: the mobsters dress up like cowboys in their own private Wild West town outside Las Vegas.  Poor Felix Leiter, 007's CIA counterpart, appears to suffer the real-life slings and arrows of Bond's life, hobbling into this book with a hook for a hand and atop a peg leg.<br /><br />Mr. Wint & Mr. Kidd, the two gay killers who were such campy fun in the film version, appear in the novel as loathsome troglodytes (one of them constantly sucking on a wart on his thumb knuckle) and give Leiter one of his funniest lines: \\"(gay epithet) make the worst killers.\\"  (I laughed, anyway).<br /><br />The Bond novels are definitely worth checking out.  They're different enough from the films to be their own unique experiences.  Fun, darker, more thrilling at times.	2005-03-16

Shaking her head at the Bakker/Swaggart/Roberts scandals, she said, \\"The devil really won that round.\\"<br /><br />\\"How do you know it was the devil that brought them down?\\" I asked. \\"I have the impression that maybe God had had about enough of their shenaningans.\\"<br /><br />But that's about the extent of my stone-throwing.  I end up feeling pity for these people.  And feeling horrible for the millions who poured their millions into these lavish lifestyles.  My great grandmother could have been referred to as one of Bakker's \\"Granny Grunts,\\" the elderly ladies he always beseeched to fess up with the cash.<br /><br />I could see through Bakker even as a kid and felt sorry that my great grandma couldn't.  If anything, I think the PTL scandal made her realize where her real devotion should have been: on the savior mentioned in every PTL sales pitch, not the bawling, over-dressed con artists pleading for dollars for that big water slide in their amusement park.<br /><br />Charles Shepard, the author and reporter for the Charlotte Observer, was the perfect person to write this book: he'd been covering Bakker for years and seeing scams and abuses up close for a long time.<br /><br />Definitely worth your while to read.	2004-09-04

That was unfortunate since LIVES remains a fascinating well-written rock saga that revealed a lot I'd never heard before: the Beatles were BROKE?<br /><br /> (I'm still disappointed that a new edition of Goldman's book didn't include a Penthouse article he'd written about how he'd been attacked and threatened with death threats by the &quot;cult of rock.&quot;)<br /><br /> NOWHERE MAN is easily a more balanced look at Lennon's last days, which also makes it more heartbreaking. It's also scary how much he became like Elvis, the man who sparked a teenage Lennon into rock and roll music: both were brooding loners, both frequently embroiled in spiritual quests, both questioning their extraordinary talents and afraid of venturing out in public, both suffering drug problems. Both died way too young.<br /><br /> Elvis consumed by his appetites, John gunned down in the street.<br /><br /> What I still admire about John Lennon was that he was REAL in a world where every superstar is carefully created and choreographed (it's so much worse these days!). He may not have always been right but he was definitely real. That edgy, loose-cannon quality was one of his greatest strengths as a musician and a person.<br /><br /> The fans who are furious whenever uncomplimentary details emerge about their favorite rock gods need to keep in mind: they were just people.<br /><br /> John Lennon would have been the first person to remind you of that.	2004-07-28

Hollywood's current biggest and most talented jerk getting sentimental about yesteryear's biggest and most talented jerk.<br /><br />At least Penn looks smart enough not to deliberately try to wreck his movies for the next 30 years.<br /><br />I thought of this biography many times during the media coverage of Brando's passing.  I read it to find out if Brando was indeed having a nervous breakdown on film in LAST TANGO IN PARIS (he did).<br /><br />I also found out that he was an enormously-talented man who nearly squandered his entire career with his reckless anger and infuriating selfishness.  I also think he was insane.<br /><br />But we'll always have STREETCAR, ON THE WATERFRONT, LAST TANGO and THE GODFATHER and no amount of the bad behavior chronicled here can take that away.	2004-07-27

I've always been a Paul Theroux fan so I found his latest fiction, THE STRANGER AT THE PALAZZO D'ORO, interesting for a couple of reasons:<br /><br /> The first is that we're reading about a 60-year-old man dealing with desire through his own life and the lives of others. Whether it's an aging countess from his own past or the ridiculous or tragic friends dealing with their own much-younger lovers, it was fascinating for me to read about people still grappling with lust, love and loss at a point in their lives when they should've figured that all out by now.<br /><br /> Perhaps that was Theroux's point: our own hearts will always remain a mystery no matter far we go or how much we see.<br /><br /> How much of this book reflects Theroux's own life?<br /><br /> That was the other reason I found this book so enjoyable: the first two novellas felt full of details from his own youth and I caught glimpses of incidents that would turn up in his earlier novels.<br /><br /> The countess in the first novella reminded me of the &quot;patroness&quot; from MY SECRET HISTORY. The boys plotting their revenge in the second novella reminded me of the comically-absurd caper of MURDER IN MOUNT HOLLY. The girl relieving herself outside of the boy's tent flashed me back to the &quot;mutant&quot; girl in the bathtub in O-ZONE.<br /><br /> Ultimately, I felt like I was listening to not only a great storyteller but also an elder trying to pass something on.<br /><br /> And it might be a warning.	2004-07-26

There had been very little biographical info on the director until his death in 1999 and I think I read most of the books about his films up to that point.<br />I was disappointed with this bio.  It got to the point where the last sentence in every third paragraph read, &quot;And there was only one man for that job, and that man was Stanley Kubrick.&quot;<br />I found John Baxter's bio, also called STANLEY KUBRICK, much more entertaining and enlightening.<br />If you've seen Kubrick's daughter's short film, &quot;The Making of THE SHINING,&quot; on THE SHINING DVD, you get a glimpse of the rewriting frenzies that went on--a genuine shock to me since Kubrick's films appeared so tight and controlled (&quot;We make it up as we go,&quot; Jack Nicholson jokes as a Kubrick assistant literally cringes), a look at the director's temper when a scene doesn't go right, and the scenes featuring his disregard for Shelley Duvall border on cruelty.<br />All of this is more than you'll find in LoBrutto's biography.	2004-06-11

Why not get his latest?<br />PATRIOT GAMES is horrible.  The bad guys, IRA terrorists, are astonishingly inept at every turn throughout the whole book.  There was never any dread that they'd actually succeed at anything.<br />What I really found annoying about the book was the teflon superhero Jack Ryan, his brilliant surgeon wife and their adorable-at-every-turn daughter.  NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE.  I actually began picturing the white GI Joe doll with the black GI Joe doll for Ryan and his Marine pal after a certain point.<br />I mean, James Bond had a scar on his face, smoked too much, and was often a sentimental fool with the ladies--I'm talking the literary Bond here, not the strapping sexual dynamo of the cinema.<br />Does Ryan and his buddy and their families have to be so...perfect?  It made it tough to really relate.<br />The scene where Ryan, laid up after the opening action sequence, bawls out Prince Charles for doubting his manhood is downright cringe-worthy.<br />I'd heard that Clancy had a cow when the film producers tinkered with the story for the movie.  As much as he complained, I feel they'd done him a favor.  Harrison Ford actually made him MORE human than he was in the book!<br />It's been over 15 years since I've read PATRIOT GAMES (and I keep telling myself I'll give Clancy another try), but I can still vividly remember what--to me--is the worst line ever written in a best-selling thriller:<br />\\"Way to go, your highness.\\"	2004-06-07

None of that had been my experience (thank God!).  In fact, I thought it was very cool place to grow up.<br />While CRUM touches on the stifling air and dreadful boredom of that little town (what kid wouldn't feel that way about where they were from?), it also brings to life some of the interesting characters there and provides some laughs about growing up.<br />I've read some of the reviews here that complain about the PORKY's-style humor, but I believed it was part of the narrator's honesty, not gratuitous gross-out pandering.<br />As far as some reviewers' outrage that anyone would compare Maynard to Twain: is there anything in CRUM more unbelievable than Huck Finn passing himself off as a woman and getting away with it?  Try to leave literary snobbery out of this.<br />I've passed copies of the book around to friends of mine, mostly outdoorsmen, campers, hunters, etc.  It spoke to them and they loved it.<br />One friend always quotes his favorite line from the first page: &quot;Across the river lie Kentucky, mysterious land of pig....&quot;<br />Well, I'll let you finish the rest.	2004-05-20

(In fact, the only thing he ever asked for in his divorces were his books).<br />But what really makes this biography worth reading is that the author quotes Burton's own &quot;notebooks,&quot; his diary that he kept over the years.  You definitely get a deeper look into this celebrity as a person than most show business books provide.<br />He was certainly a conflicted man.  Here was someone who was starring in the biggest movie ever made (CLEOPATRA), having an affair with the world's most glamorous actress (he'd buy Liz the Hope Diamond as one gift), living on a yatch off Monte Carlo, and yet he would grouse in his diary: &quot;The French, American and Russian revolutions have meant nothing--the rich still get everything!&quot;  (I'm paraphrasing a bit).<br />I believe his own personal demons brought out his best performances: his HAMLET (available on DVD), BECKET (still not on DVD!), WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD, EQUUS.  There was such a despair in his eyes that it rarely looked like acting at all.<br />There always seemed to be something haunting him: his poor Welsh upbringing and alcoholic father, his abandonment of the &quot;legitimate British stage&quot; for the &quot;Hollywood quick buck,&quot; his guilt over failed marriages.  Unfortunately, he turned to drink too often to numb himself.<br />Richard Burton was a great actor.  Even if some of the pain and rage was real.	2004-01-29

Surely none of them could be accused of being part of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.<br />Well, maybe Dick Morris is.<br /><br />I always felt that history would be unkind to Bill Clinton.  He always appeared to be an astoundingly self-centered man, ridiculously reckless with his personal life and unabashedly shameless with his own greed and lies.  As a columnist said near the end of his term, \\"Clinton may not have been the worst president we ever had, but he was certainly the worst person to have ever been president.\\"<br />In Rich Lowry's LEGACY, we see just how terrible the price America's paid for this president's \\"politics of personal destruction.\\"<br />This book actually serves as good overview of the Clinton years since many other books exist about each scandal.  THE YEAR OF THE RAT by Edward Timperlake & William Triplett and BETRAYAL by Bill Gertz take detailed looks into the campaign finance scandals and Clinton's willingness to please the Chinese.  SELLOUT by David P. Schippers (a Democrat who voted for Clinton twice) covers the impeachment mess, as well as Peter Baker's THE BREACH.

I saw it when I was 9 on New Year's Eve, 1972, and I watch it every New Year's.<br />After finding an old Saturday Evening Post article about how Paul Gallico came to write the novel, I decided to give the book a read years after seeing the movie.<br />(Gallico remembered a childhood trip he took aboard the Queen Mary when a wave hit the ship so hard, it nearly tipped over.  An officer sitting at a table nearby in the dining hall muttered aloud, &quot;Blimey, we nearly went over that time!&quot;  That memory motivated Gallico to inquire insurance companies about capsized ships and he went on to write POSEIDON).<br />There are very few examples of the movie surpassing the book, but this is one of them.<br />Why?<br />Because it's the message in each.  In the film, the defrocked preacher genuinely cares about his small &quot;flock&quot; that follows him up through the bottom of the ship--even going so far as to sacrificing himself to see their survival.  In the book, he comes off as bitter and even crazy, culminating in such an looney act that you can't stand him--or Gallico for subjecting his reader to it.<br />The same could also be said for how the author dispatches other characters.  Other deaths aren't tragic, they're just cruel.<br />I realize it's a disaster story and unrealistic to expect happy endings for most of the characters.  A very smart screenwriter once said that &quot;movies can tell people that life is hard and life can be tragic, but they shouldn't tell an audience that life is crap.&quot;  I got that feeling from reading the novel.<br />Gallico's theme appeared to be: Life is hard, but religion will just make it harder (the survivors left in the ballroom are also rescued in the novel without the hellish journey of the main characters--the crazy preacher took them on a foolish journey).  The movie said: even in the face of disaster and loss, faith, courage and love can still survive.<br />Fortunately, the screenwriters jettisoned most of Gallico's choices and made a movie worth seeing repeatedly and caring about.ive.<br />Fortunately, the screenwriters jettisoned most of Gallico's choices and made a movie worth seeing repeatedly and caring about.	2003-12-15

Then a good friend of mine told me about when he worked at the Vegas Aladdin and saw Jerry Lewis completely lose his mind on a group of little children who'd talked their way backstage during a telethon to give him a donation.  Jerry screamed every type of profanity at them.  (A humiliated Chad Everrett hustled the kids to his limo for a ride home and my friend said he trembled in rage to keep from throttling Jerry).<br />When I saw Jerry on stage in the 1990's, I was stunned by the amount of swearing he did--even as I've seen him in interviews swear he never cusses on stage!<br />Obviously, any honest account of Jerry Lewis will have to try to reconcile the sweet, clumsy &quot;nine-year-old&quot; clown and the rampaging, egocentric monster.  Shawn Levy has done that and I admire his book for not going too far one way or the other.  I picked up the book to read about the unseen film, THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED, and for any insight into the Martin &amp; Lewis split (I'd also read Nick Tosches' DINO), and I'm glad I did.<br />For the people (including Jerry himself) who would dismiss this book as a &quot;hatchet job,&quot; you only have to look at Jerry's behavior and quotes himself to see both sides of him: Jerry not only disowned one of his sons for talking to the Enquirer, he completely wrote him out of every biography of him (&quot;Love hard, hate hard&quot;); Jerry's dismissal of all women comics as &quot;unfunny&quot; and &quot;predominately here to have children&quot;; his recent interview with Bill O'Reilly where he declares that JFK never had an affair with Marilyn Monroe--because Jerry did!  (Even O'Reilly, a man not known to be caught unawares, blinked, speechless).<br />Jerry's wretched behavior, whether drug-induced or simply chosen, can't diminish his contribution to entertainment, only diminish one's opinion of him as a human being.  And I don't think Jerry cares what you think about him.<br />I can just see him as Buddy Love (a creation mistaken for Dean when it was really Jerry), lighting up a smoke and saying, &quot;I've done it all, baby.&quot;diminish one's opinion of him as a human being.  And I don't think Jerry cares what you think about him. <BR>I can just see him as Buddy Love (a creation mistaken for Dean when it was really Jerry), lighting up a smoke and saying, &quot;I've done it all, baby.&quot;	2003-11-29

In most of them, I've read about illiteracy, incest, black lung, poverty and a whole heap of despair.  Okay.  Unfortunately, that was true for some residents--but the West Virginia I knew was friendly, funny, loving and, at times, breathtakingly beautiful.  I make it back at least once a year and it still is all of those things and then some.<br />That's a side of the state I'm still looking for in fiction and nonfiction both.<br />I'm grateful to John O'Brien for the sections of his book that take on the long-standing myths and misconceptions about the Mountain State.  It's definitely worth reading just for that.  The other criticisms I've read on here have merit and I felt O'Brien's emotional problems and his relationship with his father were vague and sometimes even evasive.  He sounded very clear about the state around him but not his own state of mind at times.<br />Still, definitely worth reading if you have an interest in West Virginia and Appalachia.<br />A great step on understanding a misunderstood region.	2003-11-18
US	44511959	R3J5QN0WVUWLGR	038533429X	439139466	Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Stunning	As someone who's read a lot of celebrity biographies, I think that people need to keep in mind that no single volume will ever completely &quot;explain&quot; a person's life.<br />That said, I found DINO to be a stunning read.  Having grown up in Ohio where Dean was always regarded as a &quot;hometown-boy-made-good,&quot; we watched his movies, listened to his records, and faithfully watched his TV show every week.  The lovable drunk persona he cultivated made show business look fun and easy and everyone in my family referred to him as Dino as if they all knew him.<br />So it was something of a shock to read how aloof and distant he was throughout his life.  And I don't mean that in a bad way: it's just odd that someone so easy-going and affable to millions of viewers could keep those closest to him so remote and baffled.<br />Tosches zeroes in on that and makes it very hip.  Dean eases through New York clubs of the 40's, Hollywood in the 50's, Vegas in the 60's--and nothing really impresses him.  Frank Sinatra, the Mafia, JFK, Hollywood studios.  Eh, whatever.  This was the first biography I've read where I felt I knew LESS about a person after reading it.<br />Stylistically, some parts of DINO are laugh-outloud funny and Dean comes off all the cooler for it.<br />Does this book sum up Dean Martin's life?  No.  I've skimmed his son Ricci's book (and will read it someday) and I found BACKSTAGE AT 'THE DEAN MARTIN SHOW' also interesting for another side of Dean (written by his musical director).<br />From all of these books, you might get a decent picture of what he was really like.<br />And they all add up to a very smooth king of cool.	2003-11-17

He asked Chancellor if it was possible for an anchorman to go nuts on TV.  'Every day,' replied Chancellor.&quot;<br />Paddy Chayefsky wrote NETWORK.  That would've been enough to put him in the top grade of all Hollywood screenwriters by itself.  Twenty-five years after NETWORK hit the screens, there were dozens of articles that his script wasn't just a satire of the media, it was a genuine prophecy.<br />But Chayefsky has also done what no other writer has yet to do: he's won three Oscars for screenwriting (the other films were MARTY and THE HOSPITAL).<br />The man is definitely work reading about.  Even if I didn't have an interest in screenwriting, I believe I would still find this book interesting for its look into the &quot;Golden Age of Television&quot; and the behind-the-scenes stories of Chayefsky's film career.  The author has done a wonderful job of coming up with a lot of great details and fascinating anecdotes about everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Sam Peckinpah to Bob Fosse to Burt Lancaster.<br />Paddy Chayefsky was the real deal as a writer and I know his work will be praised and studied for decades to come.  Shaun Considine has done everyone a favor by giving us a look into Chayefsky's life.	2003-10-02

I'm a registered Independent and sample the stuff from both sides, but it's been really weird to watch the Liberals melting down in the past few years.  I can't watch any appearance by Al Franken and Michael Moore without wondering if they're going to completely freak out on the air and lose their minds.  They reek of that much desperation.<br />I used to like Al Franken when he was part of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE (his stuff was funnier and edgier in the 70's), but now he's just so filled with venom and hatred that it overshadows his humor.  I've read parts of his books and all I can see is his deep red hatred of anyone who doesn't agree with him.  But even the screaming angry man routine may be a comedy bit when he stands up to defend Bill Clinton (the ex-prez was a parody of himself on SNL).  Is he kidding?<br />I don't think so.  There's just too much anger and not enough humor.<br />(A much sharper wit and reasoned mind can be found in anything I've read from Christopher Hitchens.  The rest is just shreeking).	2003-09-30

Shared them with friends and--POOF--they were gone.  I just could not keep them to myself.<br />Thank God they've reprinted it!  It's still one of the funniest books I've ever read.<br />I'd read an Esquire article about the life and death of Doug Kenney in the early 1980's and it described how Kenney threw himself into the project (reading yearbook after yearbook and even wearing his high school letterman's jacket to the Lampoon offices every day).  He went on to co-write ANIMAL HOUSE (he played &quot;The Stork&quot;) and then co-wrote/produced CADDYSHACK before he died in a hiking accident in Hawaii.<br />One weird detail: the picture of the kid who died (and no one seems to remember) is an actual school photo of Doug Kenney.<br />P.J. O'Rourke and the others also deserve the highest praise for creating what will be an enduring classic of American humor.  I'll treasure this along with my own yearbooks!	2003-09-29

What started out as a nutty memoir about a clean-freak little boy dumped into a dysfunctional household of demented squalor quickly turned into a harrowing tale of child molestation.  Despite the fact that Borroughs has come to accept his homosexuality (he never really addresses it) and his articulate narrative would make you think otherwise, this was still just a 13-year-old kid getting sexually abused by a deranged adult.<br />It's very well written, but I wish the author would've turned some his powers of observation on himself.  He details the lunatics of his childhood, from his raving mother to her insane psychiatrist as well as lesbian lovers and dirty feral children, but he just throws out details about himself without explanation or reflection.  \\"I'm gay,\\" he simply announces.<br />But, with his life, I could see where he would more interested by the people around him.<br />Maybe that's his point.	2003-09-09

Meticulously fashioned after a real yearbook (right down to the ads and classmate autographs), the National Lampoon yearbook is a comic masterpiece to be enjoyed over and over again.<br />I'd read that it was so successful that Hollywood wanted to make a film of it, but the Lampoon humor was a little risque for a high school setting.  So they moved it to a college setting and that's how we got ANIMAL HOUSE.<br />Fans of ANIMAL HOUSE will spot familiar names in the yearbook: Larry Kroger, Coach Vernon Wormer, etc.<br />I can't wait until I get another copy--and I'm hanging on to this one!<br />Definitely CHECK THIS OUT!	2003-07-30

From that outstanding opening shot of William Holden floating face down in that \\"pool he always wanted\\" to Norma Desmond's descent down the stairs into triumphant insanity, this film will always be one of the all-time greats.<br />Sam Staggs has written an exhaustively-researched book about the whole SUNSET BOULEVARD experience.  It goes into everyone and everything connected with the production, from biographical sketches of the guys playing the piano during a party scene to Jack Webb from \\"Dragent\\" (And does Mamie Van Doren have a memory of Sgt. Joe Friday that'll blow you away!).<br />I would've given the book five stars but I felt my interest waning after the book left the movie behind to discuss the Broadway shows (as well as every instance where someone quoted the movie over the years).  I've never seen the Broadway shows but I'm sure those chapters would've been more interesting if I had (I have more respect for Glenn Close after reading about her).<br />Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of SUNSET BOULEVARD.<br />What blew me away the most?<br />That they weren't really sure what they were doing and where they going when they were shooting the movie.  That it all fell together into one of the great Hollywood classics is a miracle.	2003-02-04

STRANGELOVE is beyond comic: it's still one of the great comedy performances of all time.  And his work in the PINK PANTHER films still scares away every comic actor from ever reviving that successful series.<br />But I've also always had a deep curiosity as I've watched his career.

His beat is mainly Washington and, given the politics of most of the Washington press, I was curious as to how he would treat George W. Bush.<br />Up until Sept. 11th, the press was constantly painting Bush as a frat-boy dolt who rolled into the White House on money and his family name (it's starting to creep back into the coverage again--just tune into CNN or Donahue).<br />But Woodward does an excellent job of examining the president's character and style.  George W has become a leader and a president to be admired.  He pushes for results, has a wide grasp of the bigger picture while focusing on the task at hand.<br /><br />How refreshing to see someone at the wheel who doesn't consult a poll every five mintues to see what he should do or believe.<br />The candid, inside thoughts of all the principals make for interesting reading, especially since anyone can remember the public moments of the book.  It also shows just how difficult it is to get a war off the ground!<br />A good job and an excellent take on modern history!	2003-01-02

While I was riding bicycles in my little midwestern town, Shakur was using bicycles for drive-by shootings!<br />I know this book's category is in \\"African American Studies,\\" but it deserves to be read by all Americans. It's a national tragedy that so many of this country's children--no matter what color--are casually killing each other.<br />This year, 2002, is the deadliest year for homicides in Los Angeles and, from I read in the papers, it's mostly due to gang violence.<br />After reading MONSTER, I believe that Shakur hits on a key solution to the streets: give these kids a father or someone to care and look up to. I realize there are so many other issues (racism, poverty, drugs), but I believe that if a child has someone to care about him or her--they have a chance against everything else.	2002-12-30

It's all here.  You'll read the stories the performers and writers tell and then watch the reruns with a new perspective.<br />I remember watching the first SNL when I was in junior high and have been a fan ever since (I have two favorite casts: the original Players and then the Phil Hartman/Jan Hooks/Jon Lovitz/Dana Carvey period).<br />The book is 565 pages long, but I kept wishing for more insights into a lot of the classic characters and sketches.  A good place to find that kind of detail is in another book that came out in the late 1980's called SATURDAY NIGHT: A BACKSTAGE HISTORY OF &quot;SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE&quot; by Doug Hill &amp; Jeff Weingrad (definitely worth reading for the early history of the show).<br />But the behind-the-scenes dramas and brawls here are irresistible.  I thought Bill Murray's comments had a depth and thoughtfulness while I still wonder how Chevy Chase can keep going back to host with his boorish and obnoxious behavior (when recently interviewed by Fox News about his rude past documented in this and other books, Chevy said probably the most suspicious thing any celebrity could say: &quot;I don't read them...they're all lies.&quot;  Huh?).<br />I really appreciated reading about how the deaths of John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Phil Hartman and Chris Farley affected the other performer/writers.<br />Definitely worth checking out.	2002-12-03

In the spring of 1948 (as Israel was coming into existence), an earthquake pushed a huge boat-shaped hull out of the earth about 17 miles from Mount Ararat. Dave's expertise as a ship salvager and his obsession to find the Ark drove him until his last breath and I defy anyone to prove him wrong.<br />Read it for yourself.<br />What's missing from the book: Dave's struggles with everyone from Christian television to National Geographic to even consider his data.  Dave's adventures and arrest in Saudi Arabia open another outstanding archaeology book called THE GOLD OF EXODUS and, despite my urging him to include such exciting episodes, he avoided exploiting his fascinating travels and struggles.  He avoided all of that Indiana Jones [stuff].  He wanted his research taken seriously.<br />Maybe someday someone will take up his life and his extraordinary find.<br />He certainly deserved it.	2002-09-29
US	44511959	RAGORGVBNICQ9	0671640771	218018168	Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Hollywood Free Fall	I was a John Belushi fan from the first episode of \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and I think his performance in ANIMAL HOUSE puts him in the same league with the great film comedians of all time.  I still vividly remember hearing about his death in March 1982 and still wonder what might have been if he was still around.<br />And I've read WIRED several times.<br />It's a horrible tragedy what happened to him, but hopefully some people can take something away from this book--see the warning and avoid the same the fate.  I think the book is well-written and well-researched (I particularly liked how Woodward strictly reported the facts: someone saw Belushi in the company of a Playboy bunny and Woodward leaves it only at that--when other writers would've piled on leering speculations).  If there is ever a reprint, I think there should be a new chapter by Woodward reflecting on his experience or at least the article (in ROLLING STONE?) that covered the controversy and fallout of the book's initial printing.<br />Nothing can change what a great talent John Belushi was.  The sad details of his final days haven't diminished his accomplishments--but they did make for a scary, compelling book about the underside of Hollywood and man overwhelmed by his appetites.<br />(And stay way away from the obscene film version!)	2002-08-24

As a registered independent, I wandered Washington DC in late November of 1992 with a mournful dread that a oversexed Boss Hogg was coming to stain the White House...and he did not disappoint!<br />Now that he's gone (and Hillary plots to take over the world), I've read numerous books on the Clinton years and the very best--as well as the most damning--come from disillusioned liberals: SELL OUT, David Schippers' account of the impeachment (a Chicago Democrat who voted for Clinton twice), and HOW I ACCIDENTALLY JOINED THE VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY by the former-liberal Harry Stein.<br />And Christopher Hitchens' NO ONE LEFT TO LIE TO, my favorite.<br />No one can accuse these men of being frothing right-wing, Clinton-hating fanatics.<br />Hitchens, who can heap contempt on either side of any issue, employs such a razor-sharp wit that I didn't want this book to end.  I laughed out loud at his analysis of Al Gore's bizarre answer to a voter's question about Clinton's alleged rape of Juanita Broadderick.<br />Caustic, absurd, hilarious--I loved this book!	2002-08-22

Stunning! At last count, I've given copies to over thirty friends since reading it myself--and they've all thanked me for it.<br />It's helped to solidify the faith of those who've always believed and to spark an awareness for those who'd like to.<br />I used to pass on C.S. Lewis' MERE CHRISTIANITY and Josh McDowell's MORE THAN A CARPENTER (and I still do), but this book has really grabbed the people I've given it to, so I've been pretty much giving this one out.<br />I've read a few of the negative reviews here (my favorites are the smug scholars who work themselves into a four-alarm tizzy: you can almost see their veins pound and the froth fly by the time they finish--\\"THEY DIDN'T ASK ENOUGH ATHIESTS!\\") and one thing is abundantly clear by reading all the reactions to this book: Jesus is still freakin' people out as much today as he did 2000 years ago!<br />That should tell you something.	2002-08-18

Thank you, Lee Hale, for naming names.<br />If you were around to see Dino's shows or the roasts, this book will open your eyes to a lot of what happened behind the scenes and give you some insights into many celebrities who showed up on these stages.<br />And at the center is the enigmatic King of Cool himself, the star who breezed in and out only for the show's taping, kept a photo of himself with Cardinal Spellman over his dressing room bar, kept even the closest people guessing whether that was apple juice or liquor in his glass.<br />The more you learn about Dino, the less you knew him--and the cooler he seems for it.	2002-08-15

This book begins as a lean, fast-moving look at how someone becomes a CIA agent, but then shifts gears into how our spies have been burned out, sold out and undercut by the selfish interests of politicians in Washington DC.  You'll find out how Sept. 11th happened.  Certain members of the Clinton administration--as well as others--should be tried for treason!  Hopefully the word will get out with this book and the United States will try to turn our intelligence situation around.	2002-04-30

And very funny.  I realize not every bad review could fit in this book but I wondered where his review of &quot;Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster&quot; was--especially since he referenced it a couple of times in the other reviews.  The only serious omission is the heinous Dan Aykroyd abomination &quot;Nothing But Trouble.&quot;  Maybe we'll get a sequel from Mr. Ebert entitled, &quot;I REALLY Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie&quot;...?	2002-01-28

Since Elvis had no pretensions about his public image vs. private (he's been called \\"the Howard Hughes of show business\\"), he received a harsh treatment from Goldman and it did feel like, as one reviewer said, Goldman \\"was picking on the rube.\\" But looking at John Lennon, Goldman ventures behind the Lennon-Ono \\"myth machine\\" to expose a mad couple's packaging of themselves and the weird reality they really lived.  I liked Lennon and loved his wicked sense of humor, but I also have to admit that madness also fueled his genius and Goldman's book filled me with more pity than anything else.<br />The only thing missing from the new edition is the article Goldman wrote about the persecution he endured for writing about Lennon in the first place (only Penthouse would publish it at the time!). By taking on the cult of rock stars, he ended up enduring the wrath of America's mass media and the rock establishment itself (Rolling Stone dedicated an entire issue to defaming him and U2, those peace-loving ambassadors of goodwill, wrote a song that included lyrics calling for his death!).	2001-11-05
