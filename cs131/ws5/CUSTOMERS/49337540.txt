US	49337540	R2GNFEZJBV1HOK	0898700809	548358171	The Ratzinger Report: An Exclusive Interview on the State of the Church	Books	3	11	15	N	Y	Showing its Age	This book is a report of an interview conducted by an Italian journalist of then Cardinal Ratzinger in 1984.  Because its focus is on the state of the church, much of its content very much dates to the 1984 era, and is not so relevant for today. <br /> <br />For example, at the time this was written, LeFevbre and his followers were not yet in schism, there was no Tridentine Indult, the charismatic movement was just fully coming to the attention of Rome (how quickly it faded!) the neo-traditionalist movement (which included many of the people who tried charismatic worship and declined it) was not even acknowledged, there is no discussion of World Youth Day, the Soviet Union still controlled much of Eastern Europe, and Liberation Theology was still ardently discussed in Latin America.  Vatican II was only 20 years old when this document was written; it is now 40 years old. <br /> <br />That so many things have changed since 1984 radically affects the relevancy of this book.  An entire chapter is dedicated to Liberation Theology, but John Paul II, espeically with his silencing of Leonardo Boff, pretty much eliminated LT from relevancy.  Each of the other issues I listed above significantly affect the content of this book. <br /> <br />The result is that this book is useful for understanding HOW the current Pope thinks about things, but of very little use to understand WHAT he thinks about the church today.  The church today is very different, in relation to the issues discussed in this book, than it was in 1984. <br /> <br />The format of the book is a little puzzling to American readers.  We are accustomed to a certain dispassion among journalist, and clear categories of reporting, analysis, and opinion among journalistic works.  This book takes a much more Italian approach to journalism, with the author reordering many of Ratzinger's responses in order to construct post-hoc themes that were not so well developed during the interview.  The reporter regularly mixes inreporting of what Ratzinger said, his own analysis of those statements, and his own opinions.  As a result, is not always clear whether Ratzinger or the reporter is speaking, as they are often in great agreement. <br /> <br />There are many other books by and about Ratzinger available.  Few of them have such a catchy title, but it seems likely that just about any of them will provide a better view into who the new Pope is, and what he thinks.	2005-09-26
US	49337540	R6X8LL9EIHAMB	0449211584	529593233	Chesapeake	Books	4	7	9	N	N	I truly enjoyed it, but I have a couple concerns	Let me start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this work.  If you haven't read Michener before, this is a great place to start.  Typical of Michener, he tells the story of a region over the course of centuries in this book.  Michener has selected a particular river that feeds the Chesapeake, the Choptank, as his primary locale, but has populated it with geotypical persons, plantations, and towns, rather than any specific actual persons or towns from the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake. <br /> <br />Having grown up in Maryland, I experienced a great deal of nostalgia for the areas he describes.  The characters he creates are believable and complex.  The stories he tells across the centuries are compelling. <br /> <br />I do have three concerns.  The first is minor -- in the green-covered paperback the word \\"scow\\" (a flat-bottomed boat) has been replaced with the word \\"snow\\" in every instance save one.  This makes for some odd reading, especially in the early chapters. <br /> <br />The second seems petty -- I actually believe there is not quite enough information in a nearly 1000-page novel.  He mentions guano trade, which significantly affected the Eastern Shore, only in one sentence at the end of the book.  He doesn't explain some of the early economies very clearly.  (With what was salt purchased from Tortuga?  There was no cash available, and credit with Fithian seems unlikely to have extended there.)  Islands other than the fictional Devon island (e.g. Tighlman Island) suddenly become important at the end of the book, and are referenced as \\"the old rivals of Patamoke.\\"  If they are old rivals, why didn't they appear before?  Did this get cut out of the book? <br /> <br />My third concern is a very strange charge to levy against Michener.  As anyone who has seen the musical \\"South Pacific\\" knows, Michener is strongly opposed to racism.  Certainly in this book there are whites, blacks, and indians of the full range of character and talent.  However, the book still seems to have a strange racist undertone that I can't shake from my mind.  It comes from how Michener ties his story together across the centuries.  Every Janney is feckless (except for the one who becomes a Steed).  Every Steed is enterprising, although not necessarily industrious.  Every Turlock is craven.  Every Cater is proud, even if this is expressed differently across the generations.  Every Paxmore is upstanding, even the sad-sack Pusey Paxmore believes he is acting in an upstanding manor until he looks back on what he's done.  One Steed even refuses to acknowledge her own grandchildren because they have Turlock blood in them, and is praised by the author for doing so. <br /> <br />I realize that Michener was using a shorthand to help the reader keep characters straight across the centuries, but the result is rather too \\"geneticist,\\" arguing that genes determine destiny.	2005-09-02

It seemed to be pretty effective at this, as after a few pages, with explanation from his parents, he was pointing to the baby on the page, and then patting my wife's swollen abdomen. <br /> <br />I found it very touching to think of our daughter's guardian angel resting with her in my wife's womb.  Also, the illustrations are wonderful. <br /> <br />The story, however, moves a little slowly for my 2-year-old.  I'm guessing a child would need to be a little older than he to actually enjoy this book.  As it was, we more read it to him as though the pictures were a power-point presentation, and our explanatory gloss about pregnancy and birth were the actual text. <br /> <br />Thanks, Regina, for writing this book.  We're glad we have it! <br />-Greg Weidman <br />	2005-07-20

Jacobs tells us the story of his year spent reading the Encyclopedia Brittanica from A-Z.  In what may be an entirely new writing form, his story is structured with section headings arranged alphabetically.  Each section tells an anecdote that relates to the heading in some fairly obvious way.  Yet, these sections also tell the chronological story of the author's life during the time he was reading the encyclopedia.  Thus, unlike the Encyclopedia, that has no climax or notable ending (just a small Polish town of drinkers), this story takes us through the author's progress with understanding and relating to his father, his wife's and his struggle to conceive a child, his trip to \\"Who wants to be a millionare,\\" and his daily episodes working as an editor for Esquire magazine.  Each of these threads is nicely held together while strung on the skeleton of encylopedia entries. <br /> <br />Read it!  You will learn a lot of moderately useful yet always fascinating facts, and you will enjoy the journey with A.J. from A to Z.	2005-07-08

Rather, it is a collection of four lectures that the author gave at different points on different occasions, all dealing with the subject of the meaning of the \\"New Covenant\\" as contrasted with the covenants (plural) in the old testament.  One of the talks does address slightly the implications for this study for current-day Jewish/Catholic interaction, but a footnote indicates that this section was appended later to a previously written lecture. <br />The third piece in this collection is simply a homily that Ratzinger gave one Sunday on the subject of God's covenantial relations with us.  The fourth piece deals more with ecumenism in general, and only peripherally in relation to Judaism. <br />I don't speak German, so I can't be sure, but I strongly suspect that the title of this book is mistranslated.  The German title is \\"Die Vielfalt der Religionen und der Eine Bund.\\"  If this were translated as \\"The variety of religions and the one covenant,\\" this certainly would better reflect the content of the book.  With the current title one is inclined to suspect the author of a mealy-mouthed relativism; this is decidedly not the case.  The title seems to come from a phrase in the fourth lecture, but in context the author is presenting a case that the headship of Peter (i.e. the Pope) is the proper expression of the one new and everlasting covenant of Christ's body and blood.  This is seemingly the opposite of what the title implies. <br />I find it useful to contrast this author with the works of the previous Pope.  John Paul II shows a propensity to break a question down into every possible category, and then fully analyze each category.  Perhaps it is the limitation of the form in this book, but Ratzinger here instead will explain the limited scope of the particular question he wants to answer, and then find one or two small germs of truth that advance the discussion without fully answering it.  The result is touching and very affecting.  His analysis in the first section on what does it mean when Christ says he is the fulfillment of the law is striking:  Jesus is speaking of his own death as the fulfillment of the ritual sacrifices of the law.  Ratzinger's treatment of new-age style \\"ecumenism\\" as offsive to human dignity cuts right to the heart. <br />This book is an easy read for an educated layman.  It won't give you in itself a full understanding of the relationship between Catholicism and Judaism, but it will lay out some of the stones along the path in beautiful detail.	2005-06-13

The book is not exactly a history of JPL, although in some spots it strives to be just that.  I suppose one might describe it as a \\"cultural history of JPL,\\" but even that wouldn't fit, as her focus goes well beyond JPL.  Lord spends time looking at project Paperclip and the influence that Nazis had on rocketry.  This is very interesting and well written, but it's not clear why we spend so much time on this.  To some extent it seems only to explain the sad life of Molina, one of JPL's founders who was drummed out of the U.S by McCarthyism.  But why do we spend so much time discussing the biography of Molina, when his latter life had so little effect on the cultural history of JPL? <br /> <br />To some extent it seems to be a history of Lord's own attempts to understand her father's work.  I'm really puzzled why she still believes in the last chapter that her father's work on Mariner 69 was somehow \\"slight\\" or unimportant.  As an engineer who has worked on scientific spacecraft for NASA, I can say with confidence that to have a contractor with the title of \\"cognizant engineer for mechanical devices\\" indicates that this contractor, her father, was very well respected and had a very important position.  Lord does not seem to appreciate how incredibly difficult it is to get any mechanical apparatus to operate reliably in the cold vacuum of space.  Her petulant insistance that her father's role was less important than he made it out to be indicates that she really hasn't understood the culture of JPL yet. <br /> <br />In several sections Lord seems to be attempting to write a history of gender descrimination within engineering.  The \\"Men and Missiles\\" pamphlet is hilarious, and Ms. Norris's \\"recommendation letter\\" from a chemical plant in New Orleans is heartbreaking: \\"We had to let Ms. Norris go because of her outstanding performance...\\" the letter begins.  It continues to explain that she had earned her way to be assigned to a position \\"obviously inappropriate for a woman,\\" and therefore they needed to fire her.  Incredible that such things were written down!   <br /> <br />However, the book is not thorough enough or structured well enough to provide an actual history of gender roles in engineering, so the reader is left just asking for more. <br /> <br />This book is a collection of very interesting pieces.  While I enjoyed reading it, I cannot say that I strongly recommend the whole, as the pieces don't seem to hold together.	2005-06-06

I certainly understood the Kosciuszko rebellion much better in this context than I had in other readings.  Until we reach the Siege of Vienna I found it hard to get into the particular characters in this novel -- they seemed kind of poorly fleshed-out and generic.  After that, I started to care much more about the characters.<br /><br />The most amazing chapter is the description of the Nazi oppression.  Michener has done a fine job of taking this incomprehensibly inhuman horror and helping the reader understand it from the eyes of single (fictional) individuals who experience it.  At several points, I found myself weeping during this chapter.	2005-05-16

In this book, Joshua appears outside the town of Auburn (not sure which state) and sets up a woodworking shop.  Joshua is actually Jesus come back to preach.  The only message he seems to be preaching, however, is \\"the rules the Catholic Church has are not what Jesus intended.\\"  He travels around the town, and people ask him random questions: \\"Joshua, what do you think of religion?\\"  \\"Joshua, what about the Jews?\\"  \\"Joshua, how did you get to be such a genius?\\" <br /> <br />I'm 10 chapters in, and here are the only events that amount to any plot, aside from these endless sermons.  1) Joshua makes a Moses statue for a synagogue (yeah, like that would happen!) 2) Joshua attends a party where the local Catholic priest gets drunk, while Joshua preaches to the people even more.  3) Joshua heals a little girl who has a fever. <br /> <br />It's just all too incredibly boring, and insulting to Catholics, to spend any more time with.  Plus, it's really poorly written.  Everyone in the town is \\"essentially good,\\" and thus essentially interchangeable.  We hear from the author that someone has a \\"prickly personality,\\" but we never see a single example of this personality. <br /> <br />Desperately amateurish and mind-numbingly boring.	2005-01-06

Although I've read the bible \\"front to back\\" several times, the last three times I've skipped the first nine chapters of 1 Chronicles because the long list of \\"begats\\" had little interest for me.  Mr. Wilkinson has made an excellent point that even the most seemingly uninteresting parts of the bible have the words of everlasting life in them.<br /><br />The book is easy to read, even in one sitting, and certainly will draw you to prayer.  One wonders how helpful the \\"Prayer of Jabez\\" actually is, though.  I can't recall a single instance in the book of Winkinson mentioning Jesus or the cross and resurrection.  What a contrast to Paul: \\"I purposed to know nothing except Christ and him crucified!\\"  I'm concerned that this book doesn't have enough of the gospel in it, unless you are meaning the \\"prosperity gospel.\\"<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviewers who have noted that one is probably much better off reciting the Lord's Prayer each morning, and rereading one of the Gospels each week.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this book, but I'm not likely to recommend it to anyone.	2005-01-01
US	49337540	R18M8GP1KKWE8T	0842339655	156621327	The Holiness of God	Books	3	26	44	N	N	I wanted to hate it, but...	I was surprised to see this book in my local Catholic lending library, since RC Sproul is notorious for his anti-Catholic screeds.  So, I checked out the book expecting to hate it, and to let my pastor know that it shouldn't be in the library.  But, I didn't hate it.  In fact, it's a pretty good book.  Sproul does a very good job of emphasizing how important it is that God is Holy, and what that means for us. <br /> <br />There are, however, some legitimate grounds for criticism.  First, the analogy about Lennie from \\"Of Mice and Men\\" being a Christ figure is odd, and actually bungled.  Sproul tries to argue how Lennie is a Christ figure, and how this reveals God's holiness.  However, at the very end of Chapter 4, he suddenly reverses himself and says that actually Lennie represents us, and the animals that Lennie kills represent Christ.  Why lead us through this weak analogy, only to blow it apart? <br /> <br />Second, Sproul accepts uncritically much of the Protestant hagiography of Luther.  His chapter \\"The Insanity of Luther\\" gives the impression of being heavily researched and footnoted, but if you check out the footnotes, your realize that Sproul has simply accepted the all-too-positive view of Roland Bainton, a 1950's biographer of Luther.  In fact, all of his footnotes except two come from this one book.  Only one of the others is from a primary source.  If Sproul had conducted his own research into Luther, rather than just believing a single biographer, he would have found a man who likely was insane, but it was drunkenness and scrupulousness that drove Luther insane, not the holiness of God.  Sproul makes it out as though Luther's delay at the Diet of Worms was for prayer.  History has well documented that rather it was to conspire for his own \\"kidnapping.\\"  This kind of one-sidedness is inappropriate for a book that presents itself in such a scholarly way. <br /> <br />Finally, any Catholic who reads this book will simply see it as missing a great deal.Catholics are accustomed to kneeling in awe of God's holiness, especially in his presence in the Eucharist.  I was left feeling sorry for Sproul that he doesn't understand the great and mysterious presentation of His Holiness that God has provided for us in his own body and blood. <br /> <br />Given those critiques, I really was touched by this book.  It often lead me to prayer, and gave me overall a much more postive impression of Sproul than I had gained simply by reading his detractors.	2004-12-18

Try making sense of that review, and you will get a sense of the difficulty I had in trying to make sense of this book.  The back cover page of this book insists that Mr. Perkins is \\"a professional writer.\\"  If this is so, then it high time that Mr. Perkins quit his day job.  I certainly hope he has some other vocation than writing! <br /> <br />No review could be as damning of this book as actually quoting from it.  So, here's a paragraph from pages 36-37: <br /> <br />\\"Upon reviewing the games particulars it does become evident to some students and players alike that there is a fine balance in the competition of forms involved in its designs.  Between attack and defense in games and the image of the whole set and its balance between its reciprocals and the interior double set of its whole organization it is so completed.  About the interior row of doubles in its number field it has 'wings' of combination tiles.  Wings of ascendance! Individual tiles in the body of the 100 tiles perfectly embody individual numbers in a complete number order of a set of consecutive numbers: such examples as a 0:1 tile for the number 1 in a set of a hundred and 9:9 for a number 99 order are typical.\\" [sic.] <br /> <br />Good luck to you if you can make sense of this book!  His claim that there are \\"100+\\" games in the book is completely absurd.  There are perhaps 6 or 7 new games in here.  Now, if you believe that two games that differ only in which domino, double blanks or double six, is wild are two completely different games, then you might get to \\"100+\\" yourself.  Mr. Perkins gives these two games different names (\\"WILDOUBLE\\" and \\"DOUBLETTO\\") as though they were somehow distinct.  Note that words IN ALL CAPITALS figure prominently throughout the book. <br /> <br />By puzzling and parsing through Mr. Perkins' spaghetti text, I did manage to piece together the rules of a couple new games of dominoes that I hadn't encountered before.  I doubt that he has actually test-played them, as one of them required significant modifications before it did anything except let the second player win immediately.  We have started playing games that we think are somewhat similar to Mr. Perkins' MIX&MATCH, DICEMAX, and DIGADO games with some success.  However, we cannot be sure as trying to decipher these writings is quite a chore. <br /> <br />Here's some additional text, from page 38: <br />\\"From one ordered set of 100 dominoes with some manipulations a new set emerges and another order of prescription: such is the standards for issuing the 2-dollar bill to commemorate and celebrate it: are you with me? One sees the 450 dots on one half of the set as a whole depicted and so a 500-cent bill is issued by government along with those eagles of course, O.K.? This is in keeping with the 900 dots approximately representing $10.00.  'Count' and 'account', as terms of expression are good qualities that may change our lives for the good at best.  Surely we will want to include them in our study of these numbers.  Count on them!\\" <br /> <br />The place in the text where he explains that he believes that by mastering domino forms he will become more attractive to women is particularly embarassing. <br /> <br />Don't buy this book.	2004-11-07

Vinge imagines our world with a single technological advancement -- the bobble -- introduced.  The imagined future is sufficiently credible to make this an entertaining story. <br /> <br />The characters are interesting, but insufficiently fleshed out.  We read an \\"explanation\\" of Miguel's motivations, but that explanation seems a little to facile.  Allison notes that Paul seems to want her to leave, but we don't really get into the internal conflicts that must be racing through Paul to give her that impression.  That Della would fall for Miguel seems only to move the story, not to reveal Della's heart.  The examples could continue. <br /> <br />The plot, however, is briskly paced and well structured, with victory wrapped around defeat, wrapped around victory, in an interesting overlay.   <br /> <br />There are some minor problems with timing.  Della seems to contact Avery while still under Wili's quarrantine.  And Avery doesn't seem to have enough time after he fully understood the bobble to use that knowledge in the Renaissance plan. <br /> <br />Don't look for deep insights into philosophy, science, politics, or the human person in this book.  (Contrast it with Jablokov's \\"Carve the Sky,\\" which is a moving, poetic meditation on the significance of aesthetics.)  Instead, it is a well-paced, entertaining visit to a fairly credible future.	2004-10-25

This book is very well researched and footnoted.  Pula clearly has thoroughly reviewed both original source material and secondary sources.  Although Pula reports the less flattering things said about Kosciuszko, he dismisses them as biased.  Meanwhile, any flattering thing said of Kosciuszko is thoroughly reported.  The result sometimes reads as much like hagiography as biography. <br /> <br />We spend entirely too much time reading about the southern campaign of the revolutionary war, including focusing many pages on a stage of the campaign for which there is no documentation about Kosciuszko's whereabouts.  After this, Kosciuszko's rebellion in Poland is treated in a somewhat cursory manner.  Unfortuntely, Pula has failed to explain to us well enough how someone so consistently described as meek, amiable, humble, and unconcerned with self-promotion could end up being granted powers over Poland approximating that of absolute monarch.  I left this book thirsting for more information about Kosciuszko's leadership in Poland, and wishing for considerably less detail about the british defenses at Ninety-six. <br /> <br />That said, this seems to be the best written, most thoroughly researched, most completely documented biography of Kosciuszko available in the English language today.	2004-10-18

Clark's writing style is very easy to read -- you don't need to be a military expert to understand him.  This account is chronological, even sometimes hour-by-hour, and reports on how we got into a war in Kosovo, and why certain key decisions were made.<br />You will be amazed at the revelations Clark makes about Serbian security and intelligence capabilities, Milosovic's character (or lack thereof), tensions within NATO, and the complexities of US military operations.  I could hardly put this book down.<br />Sometimes, however, the book reads as a personal defense.  He often blames problems with negotiations or operations on higher-ups, or on inherent structrual problems with the SACEUR position.  Any reader should know that many people in the military do not view Wesley Clark with high esteem, and blame many of the problems during Kosovo specifically on him.  I personally found Clark's version of events generally believable, but I wait for history to pass the final judgement.	2003-01-15

Greg Bear has a remarkable vision for the future of both religion and architecture that will leave you in awe.  These are not normal subjects for SciFi, and it's a really interesting trip.<br />I had read Strength of Stones before, and returned to it after recently reading Greg Bear's &quot;Vitals.&quot;  Vitals has a complete shipwreck of an ending (literally and figuratively!), and I'm realizing that this is typical of Greg Bear.  Even his best (&quot;Eon&quot;) has a kind of fuzzy ending.  &quot;Strength of Stones&quot; is great until the last few pages, when the action suddenly shifts to a different continent, with a completely different vision of the future of architecture and religion.  Where did that come from!??!  It seems that Mr. Bear just doesn't know how to end a book in a way that makes any sense.  Despite this, Strength of Stones is a great journey, even if the ending is botched.<br />I docked a star from this particular printing.  The paperback with a green cover is listed as an &quot;iBook.&quot;  I don't know what that means, but I think this is a different publisher than the copy I originally read.  Several sections of this book read like a previous printing of it was sent through OCR, and then the editing was poor.  For example, &quot;walls&quot; shows up as &quot;wails&quot; several times.  Also, one character's name switches back and forth between &quot;Lod&quot; and &quot;Led.&quot;  (I seem to recall it was &quot;Lod&quot; in the original.)  I'm not sure where this publishing run came from, but it's a bit frustrating to read.  If there's an earlier run of this book available in your local used book shop, you might be better off with that version.	2003-01-15
US	49337540	R231S3O6IOW8EQ	0471413879	2724190	Systems Analysis and Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML	Books	2	17	19	N	N	Minimally Acceptable as a College Textbook	The authors take on a pretty broad topic, and give it just cursory overview.  Their 16 chapters are divided into the broad areas of Planning, Analysis, Design, and Implementation.  However, the individual chapters within the text are not well organized within those areas.  For example, what are UML Class diagrams and structural modeling doing in the Analysis phase, when they more clearly belong in design?  It seems like UML has been pasted into a systems book just so that a current buzzword can end up in the title.  When was the last time any of you used CRC cards?  Yet they end up in the same chapter with UML diagrams.<br />Chapter 10, System Architecture Design, is rather disappointing. Although the book mentions terrorist attacks, indicating its 2002 heritage, there is barely a mention of web-based deployment or eCommerce paradigms in this section.<br />Many of the anecdotes collected as side bars in the book are entertaining, but they don't always make a point relevant to the discussion at hand.<br />If this is your textbook for a class, pay close attention to the prof.  You will get much better insights into System Analysis and Design from a real person with real-world experience, than this cobbled-together book.	2002-10-02

This is not his best book (Xenocide) nor his worst book (Homecoming volume 2, so far, although I haven't read all his books).<br />I really appreciated the insight into the lives of Mormons in the south, and the characters are very real and quite memorable.  Unfortunately, the book just really kind of drags in the middle.  I found the point at which other viewers said they \\"gasped\\" or \\"cried\\" to be rather predictable.  I had figured out \\"who did it\\" rather early on, so the other revelations about other \\"suspicious\\" characters just seemed contrived to throw you off course.<br />This book was much better for its characterizations, than for the story itself.	2002-09-12

I'm quite a fan of Orson Scott Card, and I appreciate that he lets his faith infuse his writing.  Although not a Morman, I<BR>recognize Card's inherent morality as one of his strong points.  Unfortunately, in this book, and in this series, Card has gotten away from forming his writing by moral dilemmas, and instead has gotten into subtle propaganda for the LDS church.  It's kind of like L. Ron Hubbard writing about Xebu or clams.<br />The combination makes this work both below Card's normally excellent standards, and also not a very good book.	2002-08-26

Even Grady Booch doesn't use the Booch method anymore.<br />Robert Martin includes one of the best sections on software metrics you are going to find anywhere.  His discussion of coupling is clear and usable.  He was a little too zealous when he &quot;defined&quot; representational objects as &quot;not-OO&quot; because they didn't fit on his &quot;main sequence.&quot;  His main sequence analysis is useful, but he's a little too rigid about it.<br />His definition of the famous &quot;Open-Closed&quot; principle is obscure, but he makes up for it with copious examples.<br />I really must praise his Security System example as one of the best thought out examples in the literature.  His use case analyses, though, are really not up with the times, and were not very well explained in the first place.<br />Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of folks writing better books in the time since.  For use cases, Check out Alistair Cockburn.  For modeling, pretty much anything post 1999 from Rational Software will give you better method introductions.  Read this book, though, for examples of how even big projects can be done well.	2002-07-22
US	49337540	R1K4HB2ZXS3YHO	0380797151	507827222	Deepdrive	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Truly a Space Opera	If you've ever seen the opera \\"La Boheme,\\" or even the musical \\"Rent,\\" you know this story. Well, this story suffers from the same plot problem that La Boheme has -- all of the action is in the first act! After we leave Venus, a little before halfway through the book, we just have a long slow decline as the characters recombine and reminisce. I've never liked this plot, and am disappointed in Jablokov for resurrecting it.<br />I give him three stars though for three things that deserve special note : 1. His language, 2. His Science, 3. His Aliens. As always, Jablokov has a poetry of language and beauty of vision that gives his books a grace, indeed a tangible texture, that few other sci-fi authors achieve. You will remember this book as as much in your senses of touch, hearing, and taste as you do the story. Despite the near mysticism of the Deep Drive, Jablokov remains rooted in hard science. He made me believe that people will live on Venus some day. No mean feat, that! A great planetary vision. Finally, Jablokov does a great job getting rid of the putty-head aliens from Star Trek -- His aliens are fully thought out, and yet emotionally understandable to humans.<br />...	2002-07-17

The priest and the nun ring true as real people, and their relationship (or lack thereof) seems very honest.  <br />The great thing about this book is that, except for the Corpus Dei, it exists in the real world, where real people live, making realistic decisions.<br />Fun!  I'm a devout Christian, but I'd read this athiest's work again.	2002-07-16

It is a rugged construction and a<BR>convenient size to keep open in your hand as you lay down.<BR>The type face is a little small, though, so some folks<BR>may need to wear glasses for a little bedtime reading.<br />The NAB (Revised) suffers from some uneven commentary.  If<BR>you read the introductions to the books and the notes, you<BR>will find that some books are much better commented than others.<BR>The editors should have done a much better job bringing these<BR>differing commentaries up to the same standards.  The commentary<BR>on Romans seems quite thorough.  Other books have verses<BR>that leave you thinking &quot;Hunh?&quot; with no comments.<br />The cross-referencing notes, however, are consistently excellent.  Also, this translation of the new testament is<BR>designed to balance literal translation with readability.  Mostly, they went for the literal translation when those goals seemed contradictory, but it is certainly more readable than, for example, the Jerusalem bible, and considerably more literal<BR>than, say, the New International Version.	2002-07-10

After reading this book, I produced an game playing system with randomized behavior that was able to beat very good (but not expert) players at several different games with quite quick play.  If you want to build a game opponent, or do some basic expert-system logic, or take a stab at a simple neural net classifier, this book can get you started.<br />There's a great deal more to AI than this book presents, and if you want to do anything really sophisticated this book won't get you there.<br />Everyone I have ever met with this book had problems with the binding coming apart.  Complaints to the publisher have not produced books with any better bindings.  It makes it difficult to use as a reference, because the pages keep falling out.  If this was just one copy, I wouldn't mention it, but I have seen at least 30 copies with the same problem.	2002-07-01

Nobody goes beyond the introductory details of C++ into the nitty-gritty better than Bjarne.  Plus, if you want to know WHY the language does something, he often includes little tidbits of what the language would be like without some feature that really clears things up.  Especially useful when one of your co-workers wants to do something really stupid with C++.  You can always find an authoritative quote in this book to tell them why it's a bad idea.  Is someone quoting &quot;Effective C++&quot; to you to say you are all wrong?  Find in this book the exceptions to the rules that Scott Meyers didn't bother to explain.  This book is not for beginners, but no expert should be without it.	2002-06-27

Even then it is overpriced.  If you don't know UML, this book may lead you astray.  The author tells you how to draw things with Rational Rose, but not why you might want to draw them.  Without a doubt, the worst UML book I've ever encountered.  I feel sorry for the author; it seems that she (?) was probably tasked by Rational to write a user's manual for Rational rose, and someone at Rational thought they could make some more money by publishing it as a separate book.  Unfortunately, it's insufficiently thorough to be a worthwhile user's manual.	2002-06-27

Not many readers think well in 3-space, and Stackpole has made complex space battles understandable to those of us who have never left the two-dimensional world of the surface.  Ooryl and Corrin Horn are great characters, and the analysis of politics are helpful if not especially insightful.<br />Thanks to the author!

There are, however, many images from this book that will stick in your head.  The vultures eating a man-sized piece of meat, the Aztec human sacrifice, and the main character &quot;walking on the sky.&quot;  Some of the science is dubiable, at best, and parts of the &quot;Konceptisto's&quot; (English:<BR>Conceptualist? Visionary?  I don't know what term the original used) vision are hard to fit in with human nature.  The plot is average for science fiction.  The visual imagery, however, is worth the trip	2002-04-12

There is a section in the back based on the approved marriage rites that gives you ideas what readings to have, and what prayers should be said at your wedding.<BR>The main text is only mediocre.  Kippley confuses in his own mind the distinctions between his ideas, and what the Catholic church teaches, and so the book fails to make this clear.  For example, the Catholic church does teach that contraception is always wrong.  (Her reasons for teaching that are both more beautiful and more subtle than Kippley discusses.)  It's quite unfair to the church for Kippley to summarize her teaching on openness to children by indicating that a couple is likely to get bored with each other if they don't have children.  And certainly the Catholic Church does not teach that women should never wear denim jeans.<BR>If a Catholic couple reads this book, I hope they discuss what it says with their priest.  I certainly hope that no non-catholics read this book, since they will get a pretty odd view of what the Catholic church teaches.	2002-04-11

As a result, his writing is fresh, lacking cliche'.  Unfortunately, he seems to take a little too much delight in just putting words together, without making that wordplay serve his story.  An unusual description of someone's hat is entertaining by itself, but if the person's hat has no importance for the story, it's just a distraction.  If you have attention deficit disorder, you'll never get through this book, since it constantly diverts you to all manner of irrelevant things.	2002-04-09

Every Catholic household should have one.  Also, if anyone wants or needs to know exactly what the Catholic church teaches on something, this is the place to turn.<BR>The book itself, though, is a little dry to read.  It is very well organized as a reference book, but it's not very exciting to read straight through.  I'm a bit disappointed that it doesn't contain more delight in the beauty of our faith, awe at the depths of God's revelation of Himself, or simply more practical examples for day-to-day living.<BR>Just as you wouldn't read the encyclopedia from cover-to-cover, neither will you read this book straight through.  However, it's very easy to look up any individual question you have, and get the straight story.	2002-04-09

I saw Greg Bear live (he gives great book-tour presentations; not to be missed!) and was really interested after seeing his presentation.  Also, the biotechnology stuff is very well done, clearly explained, and very interesting.<BR>Unfortunately, the story is not very interesting.  The characters are confusing, and the plot has an odd flow.  Bear tips his hand about what is going on pretty early, and so you keep expecting some twist on that story as you plod through the middle.  At the end, things are left in a very ambiguous state, with the main narrator just kind of wondering what happened, and not really sure.  Since you aren't sure either, you kind of wonder why you wasted your time reading the last half of the book.  Plus, Bear switches narrators a couple times during the book.  The transition is disjointed, and gives the impression of a novel that needed an additional round through the editing cycle.	2002-04-05

There was a time that I read every book that Larry Niven was involved in, until this book came out.  I haven't read a single one of his books since.  After reading Dream Park, I thought I'd give him one more chance.  Then came this book, and I decided that if he was going to write such tedious books, I just wouldn't waste my time.<BR>The book involves several teams of players in an imaginary game in which some things are real, and some are just kind of projected into that reality.  Meanwhile, some people are trying to play the game, while some are trying to circumvent it.  It was simply too much effort to keep track of what was real, what was projected, who was playing, who wasn't playing, and who was just pretending to play.  Plus, when you find out, their motives are implausable.<BR>The worst thing about this book is it serves no purpose.  Science Fiction should provide the reader insight about science, human nature, possible worlds, or the direction of society.  This was just a silly reason to tie some characters together and publish a book.	2002-04-05

Take the subtitle of this book seriously -- \\"Answers to your honest questions...\\"  Christopher West has done a great job of surveying the questions that believing Christians have about sexual morality and the meaning of marriage.  I highly recommend it for engaged couples or for those conducting marriage prep courses.  Christopher doesn't beat you over the head with teachings, he just carefully explains why Christians believe what they do, and why that is so amazingly important.  If you approach the book with \\"honest questions,\\" you will be really blessed by the insights you will gain about the nature of the human person, the nature of marriage, and God's role in that relationship.    Much of the book follows a \\"Question and Answer\\" format.  There will surely be some temptation to just look up your particular question.  While it is helpful when used this way, I recommend actually reading it through.  The book is carefully structured to provide a firm foundation for its answers, which will enable you to more fully understand the implications of your own responses to these questions.  Read it straight through, you'll be very glad you did.	2000-10-19
