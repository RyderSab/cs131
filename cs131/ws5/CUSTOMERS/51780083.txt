The second book is quite good, easily the best of the series. The third book is so-so; I never finished it, though. The Hobbit is better than all of them.<br />Tolkien was a below-average writer with an above-average imagination.	2002-08-20

Now there are no more stories worth telling and all human beings are weak. At least we still have the stories and this book has some great ones, and true. For example, there's the one about the American GI on the Italian front who &quot;charged&quot; an enemy position on one knee and the stump of his other leg, shot off at the knee.	2001-03-22

Book starts with the title character being released from jail. You soon find out he was serving time for beating his girlfriend to death. And this is the main guy, the, um, protagonist. Several more disturbing scenes follow, interspersed with weather reports, death statistics, lurid tabloid stories, a chillingly clinical account of how Franz Biberkopf beat his girlfriend to death, extended and repeated quotes from the Bible, the skillful depiction of a psychopathic personality (fellow named Reinhold), the odd lyrical passage. Sort of a Job story where Job deserves the suffering inflicted on him.	2001-02-02

This book gives a good idea of the extremities of  brutality, stupidity, and  treachery that accompanied the Russian Revolution. It may not please some  readers seeking a final, official &quot;judgment&quot; of the event, but so  what? It tells you what happened and gives some reasons why.

I can't think of a better way of describing O'Hara's  poetry. He does things with words that are truly amazing, sound-wise. To  get the full impact, read them aloud. I second the earlier reviewer's  nomination for best poet of the past half-century. The only serious  competition is A.R. Ammons.	2000-03-22

I don't fault him for pushing language (except  &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot;, which, as someone else commented, is  unreadable) -- somebody has to do it. But, in this one, I get the sense  that he sort of kicked back and more or less told his story straight. In  the process he came up with his best novel which is a novel. I read this  book four times in one year.	2000-03-08

This book has a dreamy, insane, &quot;Russian&quot; quality I haven't come across in anything else except Gogol and Dostoyevsky. The book was written shortly after the Bolshevik  Revolution, during a brief period when artists still had a fair amount of  freedom in Russia. It's a haunting book about dehumanization and insanity.	1999-12-16

Everything you need to know is there. It's my short answer to people who ask why I  read &quot;books like that&quot;.<br />&quot;Day of the Locust&quot; is one of  the best novels written this century, and one of the greatest pieces of  satire ever written.<br />Too bad West died fairly young and didn't leave  much.

Bloom isn't a great writer, which may explain why he's a literary critic. But, there's some useful ideas. Particularly good readings of Othello (Iago), Macbeth, Antony and  Cleopatra, Midsummer Night's Dream, and, oddly enough, Titus Andronicus.

Many previous reviewers have likened the Judge to Ahab, and I agree.
