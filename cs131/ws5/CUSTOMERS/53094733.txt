Since then I have been more and more disapointed in her novels, and this one was a big disapointment. The plot is seriously make-up believe, a catholic monastery in the mid of scottish Highlands in the early 19th century, with a lot of things which are not properly explained ( hello, they found the map, but how did such a map indicate where the treasure was hidden? I want to know). Nicest thing about this book is some of the lines, so very passionate, but its hard to see those emotions in the characterss actions. Really disapointing.	2004-06-20

I was looking forward to its sequels, and this middle book did live up to my expectations. It avoids the middle-book-in-the-trilogy problem, it has quite a lot of action and development while still leaving  a lot to happen and be revealed in the final book. On the downside, I was a bit confused by all the secondary characters, because it had been a while since I had read TBDT, perhaps a character list would have helped with that.	2003-07-07

Here she once again twists the rules of the mystery novel, but in another way of course  and any real analysis of that twist of the rules would destroy the fun of the first read, sorry. But I have reread this novel a couple of times, with a great deal of enjoyment at how well she twists expectations and very gently pokes fun at the genre. Great novel.	2002-07-25

I was very glad to have a chance to read it, if it reaches theses prices must be good, right? Not quite. <br />The concept is intriguing and so is the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; but the novel is just too short to  do justice to the story. I was reaching the end of the novel, and I kept thinking I must have skipped some chapters, some scenes because we are told Vers fell in love with Emily, but quite frankly I still got no idea why. She is nice, and supposed to be witty and intelligent, but in their conversations it never seems like she is his match. So while this type of romance sounds fascinating, this novel falls short.	2002-07-18

It's very difficult to describe its charm, or how very good Ms Bradshaw's writing and characterization is. And since the synopsis and previous review describes the plot better than I could do, I won't try and this will end up being a very short review, sorry.<br />But if you like Bradshaw's novels, this is one of her best so far, get it as soon as possible. If you are looking for a fascinating rich portrayal of Hellenistic Egypt, this is the best I have found.<br />The only depressing thing is that lately I have managed to read a lot of Bradshaw's novels and now I got no more of her novels to look for soon.	2002-06-06

But the book was quite disapointing - maybe  part of my problem is that I have been looking for it for so long, but still it does not compare well to Tarr's other &quot;Crusade&quot; books, Alamut particularly, which is much better. Some of the problems I had with A Wind in Cairo is choppy writing, where one is not quite certain what refers to what, a lack of resolution about an event which causes Khamsin's transformation, and somehow the reverse transformation into a man seems oddly unconvincing. And despite trying not to judge the book by some minor plot events but I found the notion of Khamsin having a daughter disturbing, what cames of her, is she totally horse, does he worry about her when he returns to human shape? Very weird. <br />It's an interesting book, but Judith Tarr wrote better ones.	2002-06-03

Two of these novels I have not managed to find yet (for a reasonable price), but so far Golden Urchin is my favorite of Brents novels. Mitji is a white girl which has been raised by aborigenes and as the novel starts she is leaving her tribe to go search for the tribes of more white people. And Mitjis personality is fascinating, she looks at things very differently than expected because of the way she was raised and it is touching to watch her adapt to Western civilization. The love story is also believable and touching. Excellent novel, very recommended.	2002-05-04

This was the first Michelle West novel I have read and it will probably be the last. The settings could have been interesting, but it all ended up being very boring and slow. There are a lot of setting changes which make it difficult to understand what is going on, and if in fact one should care anything for any character around. I just could not care, and it was a chore to finish this novel. Other reviews compare this to authors I do like a lot, but for me this just fell flat.<br />To be as fair as possible, it is NOT an awful book, I can see why other people should think it interesting, but it was below what I would consider an average novel, so my verdict is 2 stars.	2002-04-26

Judy Cuevas went on to write more novels as Judith Ivory, I think I read all of them, if she does not have another third &lt;i&gt; nom de plume&lt;/i&gt;. but I am very fond (maybe even prefer) her older books. Or to be totally honest, all her older novels, except Black Silk, which was somewhat confusing, not in terms of plot exactly, but the writing there somewhat overshadowed the characters and plot.<br />No such problems in this novel. The plot is big but believable, characters are fascinating and it's certainly not run of the mill. Plot and characters, in the late XVIII century the daughter of a commoner falls in love with an earl which falls in lust with her but who will not fall in love back. Really.  I mean, really, he has serious issues which he has to come to terms with, involving a lot of his older history and external motivations. Loved this book, my favorite of all her novels.	2002-01-08

I had liked a lot a few of Kelly's other books, particularly Mrs. Drew Plays Her Hand and The Lady's Companion, so I was quite happy about the new reissue of two old novels and this new novel. But I found it quite disapointing. Part of the problem was inacuracies which dragged me out of the story things like &quot;candy&quot; or &quot;calamine lotion&quot;, which sound like americanisms to me. Other problems were small continuity things like the women the hero is courting having an old fashioned hairstyle in one ocasion but in another a fashionable hairstyle - did I miss any makeover on the way? And most serious of all inacuracies was almost everything to do with Spain, the bits of so-called spanish are almost always inacurate (dama? menina?) but mostly the history and motivations which feel very unlike the real history.<br />And then there is the love story which just doesn't work. And there are a a few clichés and coincidences which had me rolling my eyes. It's very difficult to speak about it without giving away spoilers, so better avoid this paragraph, but was it truly necessary to make Liria a noblewoman so she would be more acceptable? By the way the author does not understand what a grande de España is, it is not a title on its own, it acompanies another title. I  also needed to know more details, had Liria (what sort of name is that?) ever considered letting people think she was married? If not, why? Masochism? What would happen to these two people after this book ends, when they had sex?<br />In all this was a very disapointing book, maybe part of the disapointment is because I was led to expect by unanimous reviews that this was perfect or nearly so, and it did not came even close to me. If you do read this book, hope you like it better than I did, good luck.	2002-01-05

Usually her novels are slices of life in a period, not directly about the movers and shakers though in this case our main character gets to be very closely involved with the main movers and shakers of the Byzantine Empire.<br />This is one of my favorite Bradshaw novels. The novel is mostly about John, an alleged ... son Theodora had, and the glimpses of Theodora and Justinian are somehow more interesting than in other novels I had read about them. Wish I could do justice to the book with a good review ;) but it´s a book whose charm is difficult to describe. If you like Bradshaw´s novels, good luck at finding this one, it´s very good. If you haven´t read any of her novels, Island of Ghosts is another favorite and is much easily available, at least right now.	2001-12-29

Wow. Can't think of what to say, but will try.<br />The novel is set in an alternate history Europe, where either Constantine never converted to Christianity or Julian established the equality of all faiths, and the Byzantine Empire never declined, but in fact by the middle of the XVth century controls most of Eastern Europe and is trying to get as much of the West as possible. And magic works, and vampires exist also. I don't usually like alternate history, the real historical characters usually look unlikely next to the alternate bits, but this novel handled it perfectly, and the real historical characters of the XVth century (Richard III of England, his mother, and brothers, the Earl Rivers, Louis XI of France, the Medicci, the Duke of Urbino) are a joy to read about if you have met them before.<br />Great novel, deserving of a far better review than this one.	2001-12-28
US	53094733	RN5R3VCEOM3D9	0451457978	46111621	Kingdom of the Grail	Books	2	7	10	N	N	Not nearly as good as _The Hound and the Falcon_	I really wanted to love this book. The negative reviews here seemed to focus on the romance plot, which on itself is not a problem, on the contrary, Alamut is a favorite of mine. I am very glad that Ms. Tarr is writing again fantasy novels set in the same universe as the Hound&amp;Falcon trilogy and Alamut and _the Dagger&amp;the Cross_, but a few centuries before. _Hounds of God:_ the last novel of _the Hound and Falcon_ closed that universe to all new novels are set earlier, which certainly offers potential.<br />But on this novel the mix and match of several myths just does not work. I wishI  understood why the Kingdom of the Grail has the feel that it cames out the Pan-Celtic tour to fantasyland, while it is somehow related to the Pyrinees, and the basques. Enough celts, please, there are so very many other interesting European societies! And the plot and characterization is a mess, &quot;she distrusts him, now she trusts him, now there is a big misunderstanding, now he distrusts her...&quot;, oh, dear.... It was a chore to plog along until the end of the book. Not recomended, but Ms Tarr's earlier novels, The Hound and the Falcon, and the Avaryan series certainly are recomended, read them instead if you haven't yet. If you are already a fan of those novels, don't expect too much of this one, and you might end up enjoying it, but in my opinion this is far from being their equal.	2001-12-18

This is the last chronologically of those novels, and the main character, our ghost in sunlight is the daughter of the main characters in Queen of Lightning, and events in the earlier books are determinant to what happens here. But the books are out of print, and this was the first  one I have read and still was able to follow it perfectly. In my opinion this is the best of the trilogy and a very good overall.	2001-11-28

Undefinable being by definition undefinable, it's not so easy to point out what exactly!<br />I will try to avoid spoilers, and mention some It was much less funny and unexpected than the Vorkosigan books, and the politics described were sophisticated in details but naive in their essence - a reunification of two countries presented that matter-of-factly? Why were those countries separate, how will they react to each other, what are the differences between those? Other events did not make much sense, why wait 48 hours for a certain big public event, why not do it in 24 hours, when it might save some trouble?<br />The titles and names used seem to be loosely based on spanish ones, and I can not understand why use titles like roya (for a king!) or royesse, instead of king or princess, when lord and lady are used. It felt pretentious and pointless. And the Spanish-derived names can  sometimes feel very strange for a reader who knows spanish, for example Lupe for a male name. But these are just tiny details, symptoms of something wrong with this book, but not the cause. <br />This book was a disapointment. If you love the Vorkosigan books, give this a try. If you would like to read a fantasy novel with some interesting details and characters, give this a try also. But my advice would be to wait for the paperback.	2001-11-19

The characterization is very good, and if characters are not exactly what they appear at first sight, there are quite enough clues for the carefull reader, and it's part of what makes the books so vivid and intelligent.<br />The only problem with this series is how ridiculously difficult it is to get all 5 of these books.

She is a favorite author, but on this book, everything seems to have came together perfctly. During Hitler's annexation of Austria, Ruth  Berger is not able to escape to join her parents which had separetely travelled to London. Quin Sommerville, a British friend and colleague of her father, a professor of Paleonthology, tries to help her leave, but the only solution seems to be a marriage of convenience which would make Ruth a British Citizen, to be dissolved later. Ruth is in love with her cousin Heini, a talented musician, but it seems to be the only way to save her and she gratefully accepts. But the divorce can not be instantaneous, and Ruth and Quin are thrown together, while they try to keep their marriage a secret.<br />Ruth is as charming an heroine as Anna Grazinsky, Quin is a delicious hero. The supporting characters, Ruth's family, Ruth's fellow students, the ladies and customers at the tea-shop, have a life of their own and would steal any book with less compelling  main characters.<br />A sweet, funny, moving, charming novel, and my favorite of all Ibbotson' s novels.	2001-04-30

A Terry Pratchett book is always a good thing,and I certainly enjoy a 3-star novel by Terry Pratchett more than some other people's 5 stars, but I am comparing this to the other Discworld novels and I thought that it was not a particularly good one. It' s more similar to Color of Magic and Pyramids than to Guards Guards or Small Gods. MY problem is not that this is more &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;darker&quot; or is less funny (it is less funny, lots of recycled jokes), it might have been precisely the opposite. Terry Pratchett has a very special talent to have dark serious things under a lot of superficial fun and jokes, and that underlayer was something missing here, while the what was here was somewhat recycled and felt superficial.  I did not find Wolfgang as interesting, as Fido in Men at Arms for example. For Pratchett fans, I am sure you will enjoy it as I did, but I hope you are not as disapointed in it as I was.	2000-11-10
