The story is both unique and compelling, with some of the most colourful characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

The story was totally predictable, with no suspense at all.  We're supposed to believe that the main character is a great cop who is then totally oblivious about certain things that would be obvious to even a child. <br /> <br />None of it rang true, and the story has been done before, over and over, in a much better fashion.	2005-06-16

Lucas Davenport, the well-dressed, Porsche driving, won't take any crap from anyone member of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is back and must deal with the gruesome murder of a young woman. Just as that investigation gets underway, another body is found and a recently released sex offender emerges as the prime suspect. Lucas soon finds a strange connection to three twisted killers being held in a high-security prison ward, and must catch the killer before more blood is shed. <br /> <br />This book is part suspense, part thriller, and part police procedural. The story moved at a perfect pace, and had some great red herrings.  There are lots of serial killer books out there, but Sandford has managed to take a much-used premise and create a totally original novel.   <br /> <br />Lucas was a bit less domestic in this book (perhaps because his wife, Weather, was out of town?), which I loved.  He's the cool, tough guy who is witty and committed to righting wrongs, no matter what.  The supporting cast of characters, both new and old favourites of the series, were top notch. <br /> <br />A fun subplot is Lucas' quest to come up with a list of the top 100 songs from the rock era. He got an iPod as a birthday gift, and a certificate for 100 song downloads.  In some very amusing scenes, he gets lots of input from those around him.  At the back of the book, there is - you guessed it - the list of Lucas' chosen 100 songs.  <br /> <br />Sandford took not shortcuts with this one. The characters, storyline, pacing and writing style make this a must read and one of my top reads of the year.	2005-05-12

Readers new to the series will instantly be taken in by the two main characters; they are two of the best private investigator characters ever written. The story shows how strong the friendship is between these two men, and how strong it remains regardless of external forces.  <br /> <br />The plot is complex but easy to follow, and moves along at the perfect pace.

Lucas soon turns his focus on police work when he's called to investigate the gruesome death of Mrs. Bekker, wife of physician Michael Bekker. She was brutally killed, and her eyes were removed. Lucas is convinced that the doctor is somehow involved, but he's got an ironclad alibi. Is there more to the story than meets the eye?

The story is full of action, violence and psychological suspense. It's better than a roller coaster ride! The characters, both the good guys and bad, are extremely well written.

I am a big fan of his character, but don't care too much for Lauren's character.

It's got a fast-paced plot and lots of psychological suspense.  <br /> <br />I found the characters a bit frustrating, but that actually worked for the book. The characters, especially Kate, do some stupid and annoying things, but we eventually learn about the charcters' history, and understand why they do the dumb things they do. It adds an element of human nature and behaviour to a somewhat basic mystery plot. That's not to say that the mystery fell flat; there were some twists and surprises which made for an overall good read. The trick to enjoying this book is to not overanalyze - just enjoy.	2005-03-31

Even knowing the general plotline, each murder still had me feeling shocked and empathetic towards various characters. The plot is tight and moves along at a good pace. As in all of the other novels in this series, the characters are likeable and very 'human'.	2005-03-31

The main character, Reid, is written in such a way that readers feel they know him yet at the same time are anxious to know more about him. He's unique and familiar at the same time. I love his interactions with his dog...even non-dog lovers should enjoy their relationship. The setting (Murphy's Harbour in Ontario) is described in excellent detail. The story quietly introduces mystery and action, which lasts until the final page. Well worth reading!	2005-03-31

Stone does share many of the same likeable traits which Spenser has (stubborn, compassionate, fearless, fair), but he's different enough to make it stand out as its own series. This is not \\"Spenser moves to Paradise\\", but it is just as good! The story moves along at a good pace, and it's full of interesting characters and plot twists.	2005-03-31

Human bones, wrapped in a World War II blackout curtain, are found in a reservoir, and it is soon determined that they are the bones of a young woman who was strangled and stabbed several times. Inspector Alan Banks joins Sergeant Annie Cabbott in looking into the matter. Their investigation takes them back in history, to a time when the reservoir was a village, and the war was being fought.  <br /> <br />This is the tenth novel in the series, and Robinson just gets better and better. The book was extremely well written. The story alternates between time periods and narrators, giving readers unique perspectives on the events. All the characters were interesting, and the plot was full of surprises and suspense. I love the Banks character, so I was happy to see elements of Alan's personal life, including his relationships with his son and co-worker, mixed in with the main plot. This is one book that shouldn't be missed.	2005-03-31

The characters, especially Alan, are interesting and compelling right from the beginning. It's clear that the author knows of what he writes, which lends a great air of reality to the whole story. I loved the ending...surprising, action-packed and lots of fun to read.  <br /> <br />If possible, I'd read this book before White's others just because many of the characters in this novel re-appear throughout the series.	2005-03-31

Once again, Sandford serves up an intriguing story line, shifting points of view, and a complex and interesting main character.  <br /> <br />This book has a bit less suspense than in most of the others, but it's still a good read. The focus is less on the chase and more on people's psychological aspects. It's an interesting change, and some fans might even prefer this style to the other Prey books.  <br /> <br />One thing to remember: Sandford, even when not at his best, still writes some of the best books available.	2005-03-31

In this ninth installment in the Reid Bennett series, Ted Wood offers up a new location but lets his readers continue to enjoy the same well-written main character.  <br /> <br />Reading about Reid and his interactions with both his dog and his friend is a real pleasure. The plot had numerous twists and turns, although I found that a few of the events stretched reality a little bit in that they were very convenient.

This story will definitely take you on a ride of wide-ranging emotions. The descriptions of life in war-torn Europe are very good; it's clear that Toews has done extensive research. In addition to the wonderful descriptions and emotions there is a well crafted mystery - there are plenty of twists and surprises.

This is the first book in the Kidd and LuEllen series, which was first published with John Camp listed as the author (Sandford is a pseudonym). This book (like the others in the series) is quite lighter than Sandford's popular Prey series, but it's still quite fast-paced. The dialogue is great and the few plot twists were interesting. It won't quite keep you on the edge of your seat, but it is an entertaining and intelligent read.	2005-03-31

It's endearing yet (thankfully) not sappy. This is not to say that this book is all roses and sunshine! Gough takes you into the world of thugs, drug dealers and other criminals.

When some authors bring back characters from previous works, they often seem to be missing some of what made them effective the first time around. Not in this case! The main story (Bekker) and various subplots (police corruption, interaction with past and present romantic partners) complemented each other extremely well.

A second murder jolts Karl back into focus, and he realises that he must identify the killer before anyone else suffers.  <br /> <br />Wright has a gift - she can make you feel like you're right there with the characters, experiencing the events with them.

The mystery reminds me of the classic 'locked room' mystery with a small group of interconnected suspects. There were lots of design tidbits throughout the story, and while some of the descriptions were a bit long for me (I am interested in design, but only up to a point), they added a unique dimension to the book.  The main character is interesting and easy to care about. I'll seek out the next in the series.	2005-03-29

The author manages to paint a wonderful picture of life in the wilderness of West Quebec.

Animal lovers will get a real kick out of all the animals that were part of the story.	2005-03-29

Unfortunately she learns that an old school friend has died, and she is listed as next of kin, even though they've never been good friends and haven't seen each other in quite a while. Camilla decides to look into the matter, hoping to at least find a more appropriate next of kin. Like with all good mysteries, nothing is ever as it seems.  <br /> <br />The plot was interesting and fast-moving. Keeping things light were the funny dialogue and situations, as well as the quirky cast of characters. Camilla's perfect and nitpicking sisters, a unique assistant who never really does any work, a colorful old lady/neighbour who is always ready to jump into action, and a variety of other interesting friends and acquaintances make this book a fun ride.  <br /> <br />The only problem with reading the book so quickly is that I'm already anxious for the next one!	2005-03-29

Eric became a successful doctor, while Pilot ended up unemployed and a diagnosed schizophrenic. After a particular nasty psychotic break, Pilot ends up in the hospital and claims to have information about the disappearance of his sister many years ago. Is there any truth in what Pilot has to say, or is it a delusion?  <br /> <br />The story is told in the first person, through the perspective of Pilot. What makes this a bit different is that Pilot it omniscient, so we are still privy to what's going on with other characters. I found this a bit strange at first, but it didn't take me long to get used to it.  <br /> <br />The whole issue of Pilot's sanity is fascinating, and it's dealt with in a real and interesting manner. The mystery is compelling, and the characters are well-developed. This an original novel that shouldn't be missed.	2005-03-29
