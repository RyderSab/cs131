It is not a lighthearted novel though. It is full of anguish, death, sexual tension, and idenity crisis. It is a captivating story about a strong individual who is born a girl, raised a boy and goes through an acceptance of her womanhood as she finds love and becomes a mother. The sexual content of the story fits with the story and I believe is an important aspect of medieval times. The Church, and all it's characteristics, plays a central part of this story. At times the storyline is a bit fragmented but as a whole this is an enchanting story!	2004-08-28

Bao Ninh's The Sorrow of War is a work of fiction that tells a story about characters that become real to the reader by the time they come to the end of the novel. The Sorrow of War tells a story of a soldier of the North Vietnamese Regular Army. The story begins when this soldier, Kien, is collecting bodies for the Missing in Action Remains-Gathering Team after the war in 1975. He is returning to many places where he fought his enemies and lost many comrades. This triggers many memories for Kien. We are led through many horrific encounters that seem unreal to those of us that have never been in battle. Kien encounters spirits and ghosts both of individuals he once knew and ghosts of strangers he never met. The format of this book is very interesting. Kien is the main character and the reader is taken back and forth between times. Sometimes Kien is writing his memories of the war and we experience his life after the war. Other times we are transported by his writings to the past and into different points during the war. Then at other times we are reading the author of the book, Bao Ninh's, own words and opinions of Kien. This is a work of fiction but the reader can easily extrapolate that the author identifies himself with the character Kien. Passages and chapters within this book can be read independently of each other. The flow of the book is hampered by this at times and at other times it contributes to the chaotic nature of war and its effect on those involved. The purpose of this book seems to be to show the readers the horrors and obviously the sorrows of war. This purpose is not made to prove a point or to sell an ideal. It is to share a horrific experience and to try to achieve some kind of understanding of a war and how it affects people. This book is not for the weak minded or those with weak constitutions. The scenes of death, killing, rape, and dying are vivid and descriptive. The reader is taken back through the years of battle and the years of searching for peace with a soldier named Kien. <br /> Does the author offer a realistic picture of the war? I believe he does. The viewpoint of the war is that of an infantry soldier. So the main picture portrayed is limited to that frame of mind. I would presume that an infantryman out in the field and out in the jungle would have seen the horrors that Kien witnessed. Kien was a soldier for over ten years. He lost many fellow soldiers and many individuals both men and women that meant much to him. Kien described battles as seen through his own eyes. He spent a long time in the field. This greatly affected him. This had an enormous impact on his psychological and emotional well-being. Being a soldier in the war became the encompassing identity of Kien. After the war he had nightmares. He could not establish healthy relationships with women or friends. He could not maintain studies at the university. Kien was driven to write about his experiences in the war. This drive to put his experiences on paper was his only productive activity. He was seen as eccentric in his apartment complex. Everyone he met and everyone who came to know him saw him as a product of the war. I believe Bao Ninh offers his readers a realistic look at an individual's experience in an extremely brutal wartime setting.  <br />There is a very important and moving passage within this book. This passage is located on pages 192-193. It holds significant meaning to the book as a whole. I believe Bao Ninh wrote this passage and others like it to show that the war was not in vain. It was not just an exercise in violence and brutality for its own sake. The violence had a purpose. It had to have a purpose or else why did so many honorable people have to die? I marked this passage as I was reading the book and came back to it many times. This was the reason, I believe, that Bao Ninh wrote this book. Wars can be won but good people, martyrs for their cause, are sacrificed for that cause. Sorrow exists after the war.We lived through the war but was it worth it to loose so many people? Do the ones that survived deserve the life they have left? Of course they do. If they do not live the life they were spared the ones that gave their lives gave them in vain. I feel that this is the point that the author was trying to make. There may be victory but there will always be the sorrow of war to accompany that victory.  <br />The Sorrow of War is very different from any other book or movie about Vietnam that I have ever read. This book was written from the few point of a Vietnamese soldier. In most American made movies and novels the Vietnamese soldier is faceless and without depth. They are seen as just pawns of a communist machine. In all of the movies and books that I have experienced these soldiers were rarely if ever given any human qualities. This book gave me a new if somewhat disturbing view of the war in Vietnam. A sense of the different culture that exists in Vietnam is expressed in this book. The Vietnamese characters portrayed in this book were give souls and a conscience, as all human beings possess. This contributed to giving me a new perspective on the experience that the defenders of North Vietnam had. This novel broadened my world. I was shown that love and sorrow are all a part of being Vietnamese. The traditional American made movie or novel about Vietnam fails to show the human side of the struggles that the Vietnamese people both from the north and the south went through. A Vietnamese soldier wrote this novel. He fought in the war and his story is not corrupted by western ideals. American made movies and novels of the war dwell a lot on the inadequacies of the North Vietnamese soldier. The Sorrow of War celebrated the North Vietnamese soldier's endurance and perseverance. It described in detail what the \\"other side\\" went through. The role of women was covered in this book. Kien fought alongside and against women during the war. He admired the women soldiers he foughtwith. He respected them. I have never encountered this aspect of the Vietnamese culture till I read this book and took a history course about Vietnam. Western culture does not regularly portray women as defenders of their homes and warriors for their country. As a woman and as a woman who was a soldier I felt a connection to the women in this story. No one ever told them they could not fight and die for their country. I admired them. I saw the way they were portrayed and realized that in my American culture I would probably never see such heroism. Most of the heroines in this novel were either killed or were raped and yet they were still allowed to be those heroines. I see this as a large difference between The Sorrow of War and American made movies and books. Reading this book has added a new dimension to the Vietnam War for me. I am glad I had the opportunity to see the many sides of the issue. <br /> As I have mentioned before The Sorrow of War is a work of fiction. The story is about war and how it can change a person and a country. Some scenes in the book may seem a bit too unrealistic at times. I did not feel that the battle scenes and the death scenes were too unrealistic. War can be even more horrific than any words can describe at times. One could even assume some of the combat scenes could have been even more horrible to the reader and the author held back. What I found to be a bit too unrealistic about the book and its storyline were all of the narrow escapes. Kien was a very lucky soldier to have survived all of the combat illness, and injuries he endured. That luck was what I found to be a bit too unrealistic. The contrast between the acts of human kindness and the acts of human depredation at times seemed too unrealistic. I found myself not sure if a new character that was introduced would try to kill Kien or try to share their rice with him. I enjoy reading military fiction and am not foreign to a bit of blood and gore in the written word. I can seehow all of the brutal details of combat would seem unrealistic to certain readers. What I found to more unrealistic within the story were all of the ghosts and spirits. I realize and respect the fact that other cultures view the non-physical world in different ways. This aspect of the story gave it an unrealistic twist for me. Spirits and ghost are not an everyday part of my world and my culture so it was hard for me identify with this aspect of Kien's humanity. I respected his outlook about ghosts and spirits but did not connect with the realization of them. They are not real to me so that brought an unrealistic aspect to the story.  <br />I do have some criticism on the way the author chose to organize his novel. Sometimes the reader can become a little lost in the words. I am not sure if this was the author's intent or not. This is a translation so that must be taken into consideration. The writing at times is haphazard and leads off into tangents without a climax or a resolution. This style could hinder certain types of readers. I found it both frustrating at times and stimulating at other times. The reader never knows what will happen next or even what time the characters will be portrayed in. The storyline jumps around in setting and in time.  This helps add to the madness and frenzied nature of the theme of the book, war. Others may see this as taking away from the story but I feel it adds to its intensity. <br />This book had a huge impact on me as a reader and as a student of the Vietnam War. This book gave me a more human look at the Vietnam War. I imagine that it gave other readers a dehumanizing look at the war. Reading this book put a face on the other side of the conflict. Reading this book made sights, smells and sounds about war come alive for me. After reading this book I have sought other works in the same genre. The Sorrow of War is a hugely significant work in my mind. It is a depressing book that rips away any hope and yet it still brings the reader forward hoping for something more for the characters. As a future teacher of history and a student of the human condition I hope for an opportunity to be able to share this book with further generations. The American side of the Vietnam War will never be forgotten but we need to make sure that the Vietnamese side of the American War is also never forgotten. <br /> <br />	2004-08-20

They Marched Into Sunlight is a book written by David Maraniss about events leading up to the fateful day of October 17th 1967. This is a true story about many individuals who experienced October 1967 from many different viewpoints. In a seamless narrative Maraniss weaves together three very different worlds of that time: the death and heroism of soldiers in Vietnam, the anger and anxiety of antiwar students back home, and the confusion and obfuscating behavior of officials in Washington. This book is an outstanding achievement in that it interconnects the three worlds of the Vietnam conflict and presents them in a dramatic unity. We meet a future mayor and a future vice-president on the campus at Madison. As readers we witness soldiers question why they are fighting and what they are fighting for in Vietnam. Why is it an important objective of the author to show the different American struggles of October 1967?  What is the author's purpose in taking the reader through drastically different viewpoints related to the Vietnam War?  By presenting three different perspectives of the events leading up to October 1967 we grasp a better understanding of the veracity of Vietnam in the American mindset.<br /><br />As a former soldier I expected to feel more interest in the soldiers' story in Vietnam. I sympathized with their story but I was more drawn to the protesters' story at the University of Wisconsin. I did not identify with the protesters but I was curious about their story. This is what drew me to their story. I did not identify with their cause but it was like being drawn to the unknown. When something is unfamiliar to you, as the protest movement is to me, one seeks to educate oneself about it.  I still do not fully understand their exact reasoning. They seemed to be protesting and rioting for the pure sake of the conflict. I was not convinced that the leaders of the anti-Dow and therefore anti-war protests really had all of their facts. Protests should not be totally emotionally driven. They appeared to have a very narrow view of the reason for the war. They seemed not to see the overall reason for the government and our troops to defend against communism. I suppose it is also definitive of the times that the soldiers in Vietnam also had a fairly narrow view of their role in the Vietnam War also. There were many personas depicted in this work of nonfiction. This was a challenging aspect of this book. I was appreciative to be introduced to many personalities and many points of view but it did hinder the overall enjoyment of the book. I realize that this is a work of nonfiction but the author's scheme and goal of the book may have been hampered by the inclusion of so many figures. This was a huge story to tell and it took many personal stories of individuals directly involved to aid in the telling and Maraniss pulled it all together as best as anyone could.<br /><br />  To examine a perspective from the Vietnam viewpoint I would like to look at the life and military career of Terry Allen Jr. He was the son of a decorated general from World War II. He was next to last in his graduating class at West Point. He had big shoes to fill in his father's shadow. Terry's father had married a considerably younger bride and Terry Jr. followed suit. He was 32 when he married Jean Ponder age 18. They married in 1960 and had three girls by the time Jean was twenty-two. Jean dealt with depression and alienation from her husband throughout her marriage to Terry Allen. While he was in Vietnam she became a proponent against the war and no longer wanted to be married to Terry. She had another man living with her and her daughters. Terry wished to salvage the marriage yet Jean could not see herself married to a man who was fighting and leading the fight in Vietnam. I am looking at Terry Allen from Jean's perspective because I can identify with a military spouse, as I was one for six years. The life Terry led was ingrained into him from birth.  Hewas a soldier because that was what he was supposed to be. I feel that Jean should have been able to separate her feelings about the war from her feelings about her husband. She was not able to do that. Allen died at Operation Shenandoah II without ever reaching reconciliation with his wife. To portray a personality from the protests at the University of Wisconsin I chose to review Paul Soglin. He was a graduate student at the time. \\" The military was not an institution to which members of his family felt special allegiance\\" (pp.94) was how the author described Soglin's family influence on his views of war. Paul's grandfather deceptively avoided military service in Russia. His father served in the draft of World War II but was not sent overseas.  Questioning the American government was the norm in the Soglin household. It was a \\"given\\" to Soglin that he was not going into the military. This factor helped in his choice of universities. The University of Wisconsin had reduced ROTC requirements. This appealed to Soglin. He was raised to protest. His mother even took him to a nuclear disarmament demonstration when he was four years old. To protest Dow's right to recruit on his campus because they were manufactures of napalm seemed a natural cause for Soglin. One factor I would have liked to point out to Soglin and his family would have been that they practiced their rights to protest actions of the American government at the price of American soldiers' blood. That fact seemed to have eluded them. As a college student in the present I have wondered about the need of students to protest. We are in a conflict in Iraq. Where are the protests of this day? Have students become less political? I believe they have. The energy that infused the campuses of the 60's seems to have been left in the 60's. We have important issues today but they do not seem to make their way to the campuses in the form of protests. This is a true story and yet the characterization of the campus protesters and the Madison police was fairly shallow in my opinion. The soldiers in Vietnam were more real to me. Their characterization had more depth. This book looked at the events of October 1967 from three different perspectives; one from Vietnam, one from a campus in Madison, Wisconsin, and one from the president of the United States' viewpoint. All of these viewpoints have merit and taking something away from each one helps us understand what it meant to be an American in 1967 and what it means to be an American in 2004.<br /><br /> As a social science major that plans to teach secondary education I have seen this course s immensely educational and meaningful. I probably would not have chosen to read this book if given the choice myself but, I am glad I have had the opportunity to read it. It has added a dimension to my understanding of the American self of the Vietnam era. The book itself encompasses a brief time frame yet it spans the consciousness of the persons depicted from The Great War to the present. The human spirit evolves and in order to understand where we are now we need to know where we come from. This book<br /><br />has been a stepping-stone for me personally. I am now not afraid to read and learn more about Vietnam and its war.<br /><br /> I would have to argue that the author took a very challenging way of presenting his material. At first this book was not easy to read for me. I am an avid reader and I want to be drawn into a book and its characters. This is a work of nonfiction so I steeled myself to grasp the goal of the author. It took me a while but I did become hooked. The presentation of so many names and faces was a little confusing at times but it was a huge story that needed many players to show the many different angles that were present at the time. I do feel that the personas portrayed lacked the depth that I know they must have had but, in order to have provided that depth this book would have been three times as long and the overall comparison and contrast would have become lost in the lives of the characters. Why is it an important objective of the author to show the different American struggles of October 1967?  What is the author's purpose in taking the reader through drastically different viewpoints related to the Vietnam War?  By presenting three different perspectives of the events leading up to October 1967 we grasp a better understanding of the veracity of Vietnam in the American mindset. Did the author achieve this goal? I believe he did. My knowledge of October 1967 was of no account. I was presented with information in this book that gave me a sense of what it might have been like during that time. The author wanted to weave together the meaning and vales from many different individuals to create a true story that speaks on many levels to many different people. Being many different people and seeing events happening at the same time with different eyes and being able to express our feelings about that is what makes us Americans. Supporting our troops in their fight whether it was Vietnam or Iraq today and allowing them to perform their orders is what gives us the freedom to protest their actions. It is a cycle that cannot be disentangled. If it were not for soldiers dying to protect our freedom and the freedom of any protesters they never could have gotten their message across. I want to thank the solders that served and died in any form serving our country. If they did not do their job the protesters that I do not support would have been silent. Silence is not what makes this the greatest country on earth. One day I may find a voice that is contrary to the majority's voice and I know I will be allowed to speak because of those that protect that basic right wearing the uniform of the country that I love.the Madison police was fairly shallow in my opinion.

There are so many projects in this book that everyone is bound to find one they like. Some are so simple that they are almost ridiculus. Even if you do not think you are a crafty person you will find a craft you can do in this book. As a pre-school teacher I have used various crafts in this book as patterns for larger or more detailed class projects. This is a great buy at a good price.	2004-05-31

This is a great teacher / parent resource book. It is full of bulletin board ideas. The patterns are simple and esy to use. Actually, as a pre-school teacher I use the patterns separtely for many projects. I use this book as a reference for many theme related activities as well as a starting place for bulletin boards. I only wish the patterns on the cover were included in the book (they aren't).	2004-05-31

This is a wonderful resource for the classroom or at home. It helps explain why the activities are developmentally appropriate for the specified ages. This book is very well put together. This book stands at the forfront of my teacher resource collection.	2004-05-31

This text breaks things down well. It may seem a little elementary at times though. It is great for new parents or students studying Early Childhood Development. A great place to start when learning the basics of child development.	2004-05-31

The pictures are simple and bright. It is a great teaching resource. I like to use it as a theme related book during PET week. It flows really well when read outloud. The kids call it the octopus book. If you are looking for a wonderful book to read outloud to your pre-schooler this one is it!	2004-05-30

There had to be an end to the Rowan series. I only wish the end of the series was a little deeper and memorable. The best thing about this book was Laria and Kincaid's relationship. It was just not developed enough. I will not tell anyone not to read this book but I will say that you need to prepare yourself for a not so easy read. I did not waste my money, but Anne McCaffrey has a lot better books out there. She is still my favorite though!	2004-05-29

I am a mother of 4 and a preschool teacher. The colors in this book are simple and bold. It is a great resource for teaching Spanish/English and numbers in the classroom. I like the fact that the Spanish words are not the simplest choices. It challenges the Spanish learner in me. I use this book with pre-schoolers mainly 2 year olds. It is easily adaptable to the older classroom learning Spanish.	2004-05-25

A wonderful guide for identifying and learning about reptiles and amphibians in Alabama. I love this book because it goes into great detail about specimens. It is so much more extensive and educational than a field guide. I have identified various herps correctly using this book. The only aspect I would change would be to include color photos of the animals described. The black and white photos are great but you can not see the beauty of the wonderful reptiles and amphibians. It just makes me want to go out and discover the live specimens for myself. A must have addition to anyone's library.	2004-05-25

This is a collection of 34 case studies of &quot;living fossils&quot;. If you like reading scientific journals this book is for you. It is fairly technical and detailed. It was nice to find many evolutionary based articles in one book. Worth reading but not a quick read.	2004-05-25

This story flows whether you are reading in English or Spanish. Children are so familiar with this story that they embrace the Spanish easily. This translation is a must have in the multi-lingual classroom.	2004-05-17

This book continues the story of psychically Talented individuals in the near future. The characters are getting filled out more in this book. You have to read this one second. Don't try to read it before To Ride Pegasus. Actually they could have easily been combined into one book. They are available as a double set and that is how I bought my copies. This series is a wonderful look at &quot;what if&quot; in our own society. A great read!!! Definitly follow up on the story by reading Pegasus in Space.	2004-05-17

I read the &quot;Rowan&quot; series before I found this book. I actually started reading it only because it was written by Anne McCaffrey (one of the best in the business). Not long after I began reading I realized this was the precursor to the &quot;Rowan&quot; universe. This book was a surprise. A wonderful book written by one of the greatest authors in any universe.	2004-05-14

My 2 year-old classroom loves this book. It flows wonderfully read out loud. I have adapted the story using animal props and puppets. The kids love it. It is a great book to begin teaching science concepts such as the food chains and habitats. It makes a great addition to theme related activities involving frogs / pond life. If I have to have only one book with me at circle time this one is the one I know will grab the childrens' attention and hold it for multiple readings. A wonderful gift and a must own for every parent and/or teacher.	2004-05-13

My review is based on the 3rd edition of this book. This book was required reading in my early childhood education program. It is a great introduction to what is safe, healty, and nutritious for children. A simple straight forward approach to information about children that every parent and/or caregiver should know.	2004-05-12
US	50680347	R3SXGYIDUVHIA2	0345334310	878678749	The Ship Who Sang	Books	4	10	11	N	N	A wonderful McCaffrey book!	I am a huge Anne McCaffrey fan. I have been putting off reading this book though. I shouldn't have. It was wonderful. I did not realize the book was written in the early 60's. I expected it to be dated in some of its technology. It was not. Anne McCaffrey was way ahead of her time. A light easy read that pulls you into the story of Helva and compels you seek out the following books. A great introduction to Anne McCaffrey that leaves a reader wanting more.	2004-05-10

I loved this book. I have always been interested in man's origins. This book traces persons of European decent to 7 women. Even for someone such as myself that has only a passing knowledge of genetics this was an easy informative read. This book was written for a broad audience. This is a great easy read for anyone who has an interest in evolution, genetics, or human history.	2004-05-09

I found this book to be very helpful as a resource in my classroom. With several Spanish speaking students (preschool) I repeatedly returned to this book for answers. I do have some knowledge of Spanish. I can see how this book could not be as helpfull to an educator with little or no Spanish language background. It was very relevant to school situations. I have used it as a resource when dealing with students from 2 years old to 20 years old. Every school should be required to have this wonderful book available to its educators.	2004-05-09

It is full of patterns that can be reproduced. The patterns are simple and bold. I used this book and its counterparts Food, and Plants &amp; Shapes for many activities and projects in my preschool classroom. The pattern fills the entire page. They copy very well. I never paid more than $5.00 for any of the books. They are worth every cent. The patterns fit very well into theme related activities and make wonderful child created books. A welcome adition to any teachers' resource book collection.	2004-05-09

The patterns are easily reproduced and a great resource for theme related activities in the preschool and elementary classroom. I used these patterns for child created books, lacing activities, and collage making to just name a few possibilities. Well worth the money spent.	2004-05-09

(I am the mother of six.)It made such an impact on me that I have been a breastfeeding advocate ever since. This book covers cross cultural aspects of breastfeeding. Beware that this book has the possibility to make a mother feel very guilty for not breastfeeding. It gives a mother infinite reasons of why human milk is what every infant is entitled to consume. I have used this book as a reference to many research projects from formula study to mother - infant bonding. Fathers should be encouraged to read this book. No man should question a mother's right to breastfeed after he reads the views put forth in this masterpiece. I agree with other reviewers that all teenagers should read this book. Future generations would benefit from current generations reading this book.	2004-05-06

I could not put this book down. Any student in psychology or biology should read this book. Any man who would like to understand the underlying reasons of what works on the flirtation market should read this book. This book was down right sexy. Do not start reading it with modern societies' moralities in mind. What it means to be human and human sexuality is a lot older than modern views on sex. This book explores the reasons behind all the things we do in order to \\"get some\\". A wonderfully informative read. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that I was looking for more specific information gleaned from specific studies. Some readers may not need that but I was looking for it. I love it that my favorite book \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" was cited. (Not in a supportive way but I was still glad to see it mentioned anyway.)	2004-05-05

I will truthfully say I bought this book at a dollar store. But I could not put it down. I would gladly pay full price to own this book. If a reader is even slightly interested in medicine or history this book will appeal to them. It tweeked at my patriotism also. You become enthralled by the characters in the story. I could not decide which side I was on so I decided to root for everyone. The goryness and truthfullness of the medical prcedures is not for the weak or immature reader. The sex scenes are also explicit but flow with the story. I felt the story would have held it's own without the detailed sex scenes but they were consistant with the story. I would definetly monitor younger readers with this book. I would not let my 12 year old read it. But I loved it!	2004-01-01

It is a great starting point for new parents or teachers just starting out in the child care profession. It whets the appetite for further readingon the popular theorists. The layout was simple and easy to follow. One of the best things I liked about this book was that it had discussion questions and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter. I have used this book as a teaching tool during seminars where I work. I could see this book as a good supplemental teaching tool in the classroom. A perfect addition to the pre-school teacher's library.	2003-04-27

It showed me new and wonderful ways to appreciate motherhood. Finally, I have found an author that speaks to my mothering soul. I wish I could give Hygeia Halfmoon a hug and thank her for  speaking to my inner spirit. Any mother who is in love with the idea of  being a mother should read this book. It is empowering.	1999-12-15

This book was a lot of fun to read. The book answered a lot of question about how and why things are the way they are with computers. There is nothing on Networking. Which is sad. But  the book is very solid.	1999-12-14
