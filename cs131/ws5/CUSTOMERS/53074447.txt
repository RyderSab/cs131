The plot is linear, while the plot of the previous novel was sinuous and engaging.  Still, there is an enjoyment in traveling back to London and environs in 1930, despite a few annoying anachronisms. <br /> <br />The characters here are quite good, especially Mr. Waite and his missing daughter.  The scene of him in one of his groceries was absolutely marvelous, humanizing, and showed him in quite a different light.   <br /> <br />As for Maisie's background, the most intriguing part of it is the fact that the author apparently borrowed her, almost entirely, from the real life experiences of Vera Brittain, as described in her Great War diary and in her wonderful memoir, \\"Testament of Youth.\\"  Ms. Brittain was in college when the war began and dropped out to join the nurse corps.  She served extensively in France and fell in love with a doctor, who was killed in that conflict.  Maisie has not yet become a pacifist, as Vera Brittain did, but perhaps that is ahead of us.  This is not meant as criticism.  Reality adds texture to a character. <br /> <br />There is much to enjoy in the Maisie Dobbs books, but there are flaws that boggle the mind--little things, to be sure, but very distracting.	2005-09-13

The writer works back and forth in time and place without losing sight of a satisfying finale.   <br /> <br />We see Maisie first in 1929, setting up a detective agency that seems sure to fail.  Her first case is uninteresting on the outside, following a woman thought to be having an affair. <br /> <br />Then we go back to before the War to End All Wars, when Maisie is poor and age 13, entering \\"service\\" with a wealthy London family.  The author continues on that timeline through Maisie's education and entering college, volunteering for nursing duties, and through much of the war--but leaving out one crucial scene. <br /> <br />Finally, we return to 1929, the result of Maisie's looking into a home for severely wounded soldiers--and her parallel experience in the war. <br /> <br />All this works quite well.  The war seems real enough, and London feels right, both in the 1920s and before.  Where the novel trips over itself is in the one dimensional characters.  For example, Maisie's father is Joe Gargery reincarnated, a costermonger with a heart of gold.  In Dickens, as Pip becomes more educated he is ashamed of Joe and then comes to realize that Joe is superior to all the snooty Herbert Pockets of the world.  But Maisie maintains a straight line dedication to her Dad, to the point that he is simply a faceless horsecart driver. <br /> <br />Other characters are equally flat:  Maisie's cockney assistant, Lady Rowan, Maisie's tutor, etc. etc.  If only the writer had worked more on the characters, given them some contradictions, perhaps, this would have been a much better work.   <br /> <br />Some of the writing is annoying, the \\"tendrils\\" of hair that keep escaping from beneath Maisie's cloche.  I personally got tired of those tendrils and wanted to snip them.  Then there is the anachronistic phrase \\"too much on her plate.\\"  What next?  Will Maisie become \\"tasked\\" and even \\"pulsed\\"? <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the novel is worth reading for the plotting only and always with the hope that future Maisie books will correct the flaws.	2005-09-08

Rather, it simply ends in a version of the old Saturday morning serial cliffhanger.  Half Blood Prince is a series of episodes that bridge between book five and book seven to come.  We do learn (through a rather hokey device) a great deal about Voldemort's youth, but we still do not know with any certainty what Voldemort's association is with Harry's parents, especially with Harry's mother.  We see Ron, Hermione and Harry growing up a great deal more, with their hormones working overtime--but we are not told who will pair with whom.  And we see a rearrangement of the characters, Malfoy, Snape, and particularly Professor Dumbledore. <br /> <br />The biggest question we are left with, before finally battling Voldemort to the death in the next tome, is wondering how much we have seen in the latter part of this book actually happened and how much was staged for Harry's benefit.  Dumbledore is, after all, the greatest wizard Harry has ever seen or ever will see, Ms. Rowling assures us at one point.  Look for some surprises in this area.  And where is Malfoy and where is Snape?  And somehow we still have to understand the Dursleys in all this. <br /> <br />For these unresolved issues, I say this is a lengthy interlude and not a novel.  In fact, all seven books will be the actual novel, with each book being a chapter in it. <br /> <br />Let the suspense now build with Potter Phanatics to see what the last book will bring us.	2005-07-30

Someone at the publishing house should have had the courage to point out some problems to the writer:  (1) She repeats information not once but many times, apparently having forgotten that she had already said that; (2) The plot and denouement are not likely and are hard to follow.  For example, the police supposedly look everywhere for the gun that killed Sebastian, and eventually it is deduced that the one place they didn't look was in the drain funnel on the roof of the master's abode.  And lo, there it was, wrapped in a cloth and stuck, barrel down.  To prove(?) that it was the fatal gun, the cistern barrel for that downpipe is dry.  What?  Say that again? <br /> <br />In short, the characters, the dialogue, the atmosphere just don't measure up to the plunges the reader takes into the drawing rooms and rookeries of London, circa 1880+.  Rather than go into this series, the reader would do well to go back and read the Victorian books.  That's a sorry suggestion, and I'm sorry to have to make it.	2005-07-30

But other reviewers have covered the storyline vagaries, and repeating them is distasteful.  The characters are phony.  The dialogue is wooden.  There is no atmosphere, no distinct sense of place.  Cliches abound, and when you think the writer couldn't top the last one--she does.  In short, this book is not even worth discussion.  It should simply be dismissed.  Why didn't the editors and publishers do exactly that? <br /> <br />This was my first book by Ms. Johansen.  It will also be my last.	2005-05-19

I'll admit, that is a somewhat daunting task.  What is evil?  Try to define it without religious overtones.  The wolf and the bear have no concept of evil, just of survival--according to the man in the basement.  Perhaps, as one philosopher has pointed out, \\"What truly separates man from the beast are pointless ritual and mindless superstition.\\"  Wolves have no truck with such human concepts such as \\"evil.\\"  Wolves just do what they do.  But man with his bicameral brain thinks about what he does. <br /> <br />As he tries to sort it out for himself and his \\"warden,\\" the man in the basement seeks some form of atonement for all the imagined or real evil he has done or helped do or perpetuated.  But masochism and discomfort and filth are hardly atonement--at least, in my view.  And self punishment does not help the prisoner in the end, as the reader will discover. <br /> <br />Supposedly the man in the basement has had some sort of healing effect upon Charles.  He is more cordial, does better with women, etc. after his encounters with his \\"prisoner.\\"  Maybe the money had something to do with it.  He says at one point that the money doesn't matter.  But I wonder.... <br /> <br />The book is very nicely written, moves well, and has interesting characters. <br /> <br />	2005-02-16

The plot is out of some silly, puerile comic book of old.  The characters are often laughable, especially the villains.  The atmosphere is all over the place and never real.  Even the obligatory sex scene is silly.  In short, the book is a total waste of one's time.	2005-02-10
US	53074447	R25J4ZOXNCVDLF	0385510454	797048445	The Broker: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Why?	On the positive side, the plot of this novel moves at supersonic speed.  I've read a great many so-called international thrillers, but I haven't found one that moves this fast since \\"The Day of the Jackall.\\"  Unfortunately, the speed of the plot is also a negative, since so many unanswered questions are left in the wake. <br /> <br />Other reviews have examined the plot in excruciating detail, so I won't go into any of that--except to say that most of the unanswered questions about the plot begin with the word \\"Why.\\"  And there are several.  A writer, of course, does not have to answer all the whys.  Still, the reader should not be left in a puzzled state.  Why pardon Backman?  Why would his death tell the CIA anything worthwhile for the future?  Why not have him killed immediately if it has to be done eventually?  Why send him to Italy when there were far cheaper alternatives?  Why spend the money on language lessons?  Why waste taxpayer money on food, lodging, clothes, and all those endless, endless cups of espresso?  Does Occam's Razor not apply to novels of intrigue?  Of course, it it did, the novel would be about ten pages long. <br /> <br />Despite all this, the novel is worthwhile as a study in pace and for its atmosphere.  My disappointment is that it could have been better--much, much better--with a little more thought on the part of writer and editor. <br /> <br />	2005-02-09

The first part of the novel just sort of wanders around, wasting time and paper.  The long sections involving the octogenarian brothers' love affair was just plain dull (was it supposed to be cute?) and kept the reader from the central plot.  Then, the soft-core sex life of our heroine may titilate a few readers, but not this one.  I found myself skipping whole pages.  Finally, the long section explaining money laundering accomplished nothing except tell the reader that the writer did research into the crime of money laundering.  The details could have been dismissed in a paragraph or so; not all the research had to be included. <br /> <br />In short, this is not nearly as disciplined as some of the writer's other mysteries.  \\"R\\" needed a good editor with a handful of blue pencils.  Cut about 100 pages of this, and the book was interesting.	2005-01-11

Disappointing is the only word to describe my feelings about it.  The narrative point of view jumps all over the place, and the reader never maintains an identification with any of them.  The plot is not very interesting.  We don't see enough of Chee and Manuelito to care much about them.  But perhaps the biggest difference between this novel and the previous works is in the atmosphere.  No one created a sense of place better than Hillerman.  But like the narrative technique, the atmosphere here is diluted.  Grand Canyon in a rainstorm just isn't as interesting as the off-road desert of New Mexico. <br /> <br />Perhaps as readers we don't want writers to try something new.  I hope that is not why I didn't enjoy this.  I try to imagine that this is the first Hillerman book I read--would I read another?  Honestly--no.  I can only hope for better next time.	2004-12-11

This is true of every genre, sci-fi, western, mystery, romance....  Elizabeth Peters does an absolutely remarkable job of that in this novel.  Granted, I have a positive predisposition for books set along the Nile; nonetheless this one is outstanding. <br /> <br />The plot and mystery might be described as so-so, but the characters and the ambience of Egyption archaeology in Victorian times are perfect.  The strange romance between Peabody and Emerson is certainly not of the standard variety.  The tombs, the sand, the pyramids, the terrace at Shepheard's...they are enough to carry one away. <br /> <br />I've now read the first four in this Amelia Peabody series and so far have found them all to be most convincing.	2004-11-16
US	53074447	R2ZT4E8OWRE5S6	1582881294	575990647	Suspect	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Too much	Too many writers of thrillers (e.g., Dan Brown) apparently believe that they have to put some new and often ridiculous jeopardy on just about every page.  As a result, the plots become silly.  That is not good.  Readers are not supposed to laugh while reading thrillers.   <br /> <br />There are some surprising turns in this novel, some sparkling scenes, but they are seriously diminished by surrounding them with Parkinson's disease failures of limbs, cut lips that require stitches, broken ribs, a leap into an icy canal, a cut ear that requires stitches, a cut neck, etc. etc. for the hero--to say nothing of the other characters.  And I haven't included all the events that are over the top.   <br /> <br />The writer here would have done well to slow down just a bit and not try to put twenty pounds of danger and action in a five pound bag.  He might have trusted the reader a little more, trusted him to be overwhelmed by the truly remarkable scenes. <br /> <br />The characters are interesting, despite some of the psycho-babble.  Society and flawed parents cannot be blamed for every child gone wrong.  And the atmosphere of pre-Christmas, dank London feels real.  I just wanted to like this book more and couldn't, owing to the over-stuffed plot.	2004-10-15

As far as I can determine, the major provisions are these:  (1) Paranoia must prevail.  The hero can trust no one, not spouse, not parent, not lifelong friend--no one.  (2) The action must be non-stop, preferably condensed to one day, even though this results in patent absurdities.  Lengthy chase scenes are required, it goes without saying.  The chases may be in any sort of vehicles, on foot, or downriver (3) The hero must be virtually superhuman, able to survive falls from great heights, stabbings, gunshot wounds, etc.  The villain must be likewise but not quite so since he has to lose eventually.  (4) The central figure must be a physical specimen of great beauty and in perfect condition.  Usually the hero is a health and physical fitness nut.  (5) There must be sex scenes bordering on the x-rated, nay, animalistic, even though these scenes have nothing whatsoever to do with the plot.  (6) There must be specific, even gratuitous, violence.  Writers of thrillers apparently think violence is, per se, high drama.    One has to wonder what sort of reader the author of this book envisioned.  The plot isn't believable for a second.  The characters are ridiculous.  The atmosphere (mostly Colorado) is often vague.  The only thing going for the book is that it is fast paced and the reader is soon done with it.    Unfortunately there is a plethora of thrillers that follow the same rules, to the letter.  Alas and alack.	2004-09-27

Only a son could have gotten away with such an unusual set-up. <br /> <br />The historic characters are especially interesting:  The hated J. Edgar Hoover with his paramour, Agent Clyde Tolson; FDR's female companion who spent hours alone with him in his bedroom and Eleanor not minding; Eleanor's female companions of questionable sexual orientation; Gen. McArthur, afraid his mama will find he has a Filipino girl stashed in a Washington hotel; etc.   <br /> <br />And we learn little tidbits about life in the White House during the Great Depression.  Alcohol flowed, and prohibition couldn't stop it.  The Roosevelts were responsible for buying all the groceries, and Eleanor had to keep a tight budget; tuna salad sandwiches for lunch, even though FDR hated them.  The cook was really bad--on purpose, presumably, so people wouldn't eat so much.  The floors sagged.  The elevator didn't work much of the time.  The furniture and draperies were shabby.  There were secret entrances to the White House, tunnels to carry away rain water. <br /> <br />And murders happened with surprising regularity, in practically every room of the White House or wherever Eleanor happened to be.  Nevermind that we never read about them in the newspaper.  Eleanor kept a tight lid on the publicity. <br /> <br />In this installment a guard is stabbed right outside FDR's bedroom door, and no one saw a thing.  Two detectives work with Mrs. Roosevelt in preventing the newspapers from hearing of it and in finding the murderer.  The solution is unlikely, even absurd, but who cares?  One shouldn't read the Eleanor Roosevelt novels for the plots.  In fact, if the murder was omitted entirely in most cases, here especially, this would still be quite fun.	2004-09-22

I thought I was never going to get to the other side or this morass, and when I did, the killer confessed in detail when he could have escaped without a scratch.  And then he died.  Poof.  No trial, no cross examination.  All he had to do was say, \\"I didn't do it,\\" and no one would have been the wiser.  There was no evidence against him. <br /> <br />The drama feels contrived from start to finish.  It never approaches reality.  Every time the plot drags (which is often), the author drops the heroine, Kate, into the cold Alaska waters.  Or bops her on the head.  It got just a wee bit wearying after the third or fourth time. <br /> <br />The characters are many and confusing.  Many have nothing at all to do with what plot there is.  Others just walk around.  The atmosphere of Alaska merits this one extra star, but I'd rather get a travel book on the state than to put up with the cold molasses.  Sorry.  This just isn't for me.	2004-09-21

The recipes in all the books are cooked up by someone else.  (2) She wears good Christian underwear.  Perhaps she could be a little more specific in a future novel so that readers will know where to buy this sort of apparel.  (2) Best of all, we learn that heaven is directly over North America, probably centered over Hernia, Pennsylvania, which means that Australian Christians have a lengthy trip halfway around the world when they die.  This latter fact, especially, is worth knowing. <br /> <br />Never mind the plot of any of these Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries.  This novel, like the others from the series, is a bit thin in that regard.  The characters, especially Ms. Yoder, her weird sister, and the even weirder brother-in-law sheriff, are sufficient.  Throw in Hernia and Ms. Yoder's inn, and I'm hooked.	2004-09-21

I say a favor because the D.A. would never take the case, and if the case by some fluke went to court, the detective would be red faced under the attack of the defense attorney. <br /> <br />Enough of these.  Publishers need to make it a rule:  no on the spot confessions followed by suicide will be permitted.  It's been done over and over--and like the exclamation point, it is the sure sign of the amateur. <br /> <br />I started the book with high hopes--an Aleut woman as detective, set in Alaska.  It sounded great.  The characters were interesting and the atmosphere was fine, although perhaps just a bit over done.

Is the novel an accurate depiction of autism?  I'm no expert so I don't know, but it feels right.  There's a bit of the Rain Man here, a little of Faulkner's idiot in \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" and even a touch of Igatius Reilly from \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\"  Still, Christopher Boone is himself, unique, displaced, savant.

Toby Tyler is a small town orphan boy, bored and feeling abused on his Uncle Daniel's farm.  When an un-named circus comes to town, Toby happily joins as a \\"candy butcher,\\" i.e., one who sells refreshments to show patrons within the tent.  Although Toby is only about 12, no one questions his running away or joining the circus.  He is roundly beaten by his employers, and few question their right to that.  Adults simply accept the fact that Toby has a right to leave home and that the circus has the right to hire his services without question.  It is hard for a modern reader to get past this. <br /> <br />The circus itself is a vague world, a nameless \\"mud show\\" that travels by horse and wagon at night from small town to small town.  There were no 3-ring circuses in 1881, traveling by air-conditioned train, a la Ringling Brothers & Barnum & Bailey or Cole Brothers.  The novel's atmosphere is never quite real, never gritty enough, never quite exhausting.  The characters tend to be all good or all bad, with little known of their backgrounds, details that would make them real humans.  Toby himself is just too--well--too nice, too innocent.  He is Shirley Temple as a boy on the good ship Lolipop. <br /> <br />Certainly the circus (and the sea and the old west) was a magnet for a great many boys of the era.  But like so much of the literature of the bygone era, the reality of the setting is never fully explored.	2004-08-14

In the past few years we have seen a considerably more realistic literary detective, and C.J. Box's Joe Pickett is a fine example. Pickett is very married, has two little girls, is a rookie game warden in Wyoming, and not at all sure about what is the right thing to do in every case. <br />  <br /> Early on, Pickett carelessly loses his gun to a criminal, a taboo in law enforcement. He seriously considers taking a civilian job with a pipeline company because he just isn't making enough money to support his family as he would like. Then he must choose between the job offer and the harder but considerably less lucrative right thing to do. It is touch and go for a time. <br />  <br /> The plot involves the discovery of an animal thought extinct for a century and the havoc it will create if the word gets out. Forget about snail darters and snowy owls. The suspense and plot movement are excellent. The characters are interesting, three dimensional, and feel right. The little Wyoming town and the wide open vistas of mountain and canyon are a welcome change in crime fiction. Not all crooks live in large cities. <br />  <br /> My only quibble with it is that the writer went a few pages too long, i.e., too far past the decisive action.

I approached this book with some misgivings, having been disappointed by \\"Chasing the Dime.\\"  But Henry (Hieronymous--I liked that little touch) Bosch is a first-class, believable detective, all the way. He's jaded to some degree but tries to maintain some touch with the populace.  The us-them relationship police have with the press and the \\"looky loos,\\" as civilians are called, is there, certainly, but outwardly subdued.<br />The plot feels right, enhanced by the fact that the writer didn't try to tie up all the loose ends, such as, the surprising matter of Julia Brasher and, not to give too much away, the fact that the killer is not at all a sure thing when we reach the final page.  Not all killers confess into a tape recorder and psychoanalyze their own motives.<br />Bosch makes mistakes.  He goes down dead-end trails after false clues.  He is imperfect.  In short, he is realistic.  So are the other characters, including his partner, the technicians, Bosch's superiors in the department, the suspects, the incidental personae--the entire cast.  They don't always do what we expect, but people in real life don't either.  Too many books have characters who appear to be \\"on rails.\\"  We know exactly where they are going and how the plot is going to follow them.<br />I realize I haven't outlined the plot, but others have, and sometimes they give away too much.  Suffice it to say that I'll read more of the Harry Bosch series and hope for books that are in this same class.	2004-07-20
US	53074447	R16MRUYEN2R6K8	0316153915	77432495	Chasing the Dime	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Unconvincing	Somehow a novelist has to convince the reader that the events described in the tale could or did happen.  This is extremely important in a mystery/suspense/spy/action book.  The writer utterly failed to do that here.  <br />Yuppie genius, Henry Pierce, on the brink of wealth and worldwide fame (dare we hope, a Nobel Prize?), receives some calls for a prostitute named Lilly on his new phone and rather than get his number changed, he races off to find Lilly and &quot;save&quot; her. Bah, humbug. His reason is that his own sister was a runaway, years ago, and was murdered because he failed to help her.  This is supposed to be the psychological motive, I suspect.  If one can accept that premise, the rest of the book is all right, I suppose, even if it is populated with several of the characters from &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;<br />Paranoia, I might add, is too facile in creating suspense.  It has been used and abused in too many other works of fiction.  Ludlum was/is probably the master of the art.  That's why I quit reading Ludlum a few years ago.  I couldn't tell one book from another.  <br />Pierce comes to suspect and distrust everyone, his business partner, his ex-live-in, his secretary, etc.  It got a little tiresome, and when he finally got to the real villain, I no longer cared very much.<br />I'll try another Connelly book, but I have misgivings after this one.	2004-07-15

This is not to say that it isn't a good book.  Perhaps it is because there just isn't enough of Count Olaf, aka Shirley.  There are mean people other than \\"Shirley,\\" but they lack something in comparison with the evil \\"Grinch,\\" who was the first caretaker of the Baudelaire orphans.<br />There are several nice touches, such as, Sunny debarking logs with her four baby teeth and having pieces of wood caught between.  And then there is Shirley, protesting that she/he is not really Count Olaf because she/he has a name plate that says Shirley.  QED, as they say in geometry.

Bush	Books	5	280	325	N	N	John Dean has learned well	It's obvious that John Dean came through Watergate a much wiser man.  So who better to compare the Bush (fils) administration with Nixon's?  The comparisons are indeed alarming.  At least Nixon was elected to the presidency--twice.  Bush was never elected--once.  Nixon graduated from college on his own, but all one has to do is listen to Bush for a few minutes to realize that someone wrote his papers for him at Yale and Harvard.  Then there are the lies, piled atop falsehoods--about Iraq, about everything.  Neither Nixon nor Bush (fils) could keep from lying, and unlike the Clinton lies about sex, no one died as a result of Monica.  They certainly died in Viet Nam and they continue to die in Iraq.<br />But the real question that nags me is why Republicans can't understand the antipathy Democrats feel toward Bush.  So many reviewers have mentioned this.  Apparently they thought it was all right to accuse Clinton of everything, including murder, okay to spend millions on an investigation that ended in nothing, much less an apology.  And then Democrats should line up being Dubya?  Anne Coulter can call Democrats traitors, and Democrats should not respond?<br />John Dean has laid out the case against Bush dispassionately, which is more than one can say for the sneering, smirking Clinton haters.	2004-07-12

It's not easy to say exactly why or where this sagged.  It could be that the details of the romance of the professors got in the way of the murder story.  That should never happen, especially when the love affair does not envolve the hero and when the romance has nothing whatsoever to do with the main plot.  In this case, the love story was gratuitous.  It's as if the writer said, &quot;Editors insist on a love affair, so I'll stick this one in and make the editors happy.&quot;<br />The book does start to move when we begin to learn the background of the murdered monk, but it isn't enough to save this from being considered the least of the Father Blackie series.  In truth, Father Blackie has little to do with unraveling the mystery.  It just sort of happens.  The monk's diary appears.  People step forward with clues.  And suddenly the book is finished.<br />I do hope for better things from Blackie.  He's a nice man.  Arguably....	2004-07-05

Somehow the most recent works feel cranked out rather than thought out.<br />&quot;Styles&quot; reeks with atmosphere, and the characters, stock though they may be, are quite good.  The English country house, locked room murder tale has been overdone a bit (I eschew hyperbole), but it seems fresh-born here.  Perhaps it is because this is the author's first-born mystery novel and she cared about what she was doing.<br />Other reviewers have described the actual plot, so I will not repeat that.  Suffice it to say that the plot works, and the surprises are indeed unexpected.  The logic and denouement are fair to the reader.  The plot doesn't have to be perfect.  It just has to...&quot;work,&quot; for lack of a better verb.  Mystery readers, often without knowing it, read this genre not for the ingenious plot but for the feel of place and for the characters.  If feel and characters are your thing, you can't go wrong with this one.	2004-06-30

The poor, poor orphans just can't find true happiness.  It almost seems that everything will be okay, despite the many Cassandra warnings of the author, and then that dastardly villain, Count Olaf, re-appears and spoils everything.<br />From internal clues in the first two books, I would suggest that the setting is England or Canada.  For example, there is a reference to royal gardens in book one.  However, in the \\"Unauthorized Autobiography\\" the postcard has an American postage stamp:  the Shakespeare commemorative from decades ago.  I wish someone would comment on the setting.<br />The book feels British and as if it is actually directed toward adults, more so than in book one.  It's difficult to pinpoint examples to demonstrate this--perhaps the definition of words is a bit more whimsical and funny.<br />Whatever the case, I eagerly anticipate book three.	2004-06-26

The cold and snow of Michigan's UP feels real enough.  And the book has its moments of good writing.  Still, it almost seems that this is a repeat performance of the previous book in the series.  There just doesn't feel as if there is anything new.<br />If anything, the plot is too complicated for the hard-boiled genre.  There are crimes in three different time periods, and it is difficult for the reader to keep events straight, to remember who was doing what and to whom.<br />The violence is too much, too frequent and does little to the advance the plot.  It almost seems that the author threw in a knock-down fight now and then when nothing else was happening.  Violence can be useful in the proper dosage, but violence, per se, is not drama.<br />Lastly, there should be a rule against having criminals confess to a tape recorder or VCR camera.  This deus en [sic] machina device has been used far too many times by fiction writers, and I groan when I see it coming.  It's just too easy a way out.  The author uses it here in awkward fashion.<br />I've read all of the Alex McKnight books and have enjoyed them, particularly the early ones, but this one is a letdown.  I'll hope for better with the next one.	2004-06-24

Oh, I had to scan over some of it, but I read it only because I so admire the Baudelaire orphans saga.  Anyone expecting this bogus autobiography to be in the same vein is doomed to utter disappointment.<br />Why?  Because the book TRIES to be funny.  It tries very hard to be funny, grunting and groaning and acting silly like a twelve-year old boy trying to impress his little girlfriend with his manliness.  Just as the hobbledehoy is not manly, this book is not funny.  I'd like any reviewer who said this was funny to point out a single page that was even vaguely amusing.<br />Silly pictures, inane newspaper clippings, bogus scripts--Lemony should stick closely to the orphans.

Chips has a narrow world-view and is completely out of touch with most everything.  He is married briefly and his wife dies.  He retires in 1913 but cannot bear to move away from the boys school where he has taught so many years.  His life seems to be taken up by staring across at the school and reading detective novels.  It is hardly enough to sustain a reader's interest.<br />During the World War he returns to the school temporarily, while the faculty is thinned out by army recruitment.  During all this, he seems almost proud of his ignorance in such things as movies, popular music, etc.  The only part I found interesting was Chips' tribute to a former teacher who taught German at the school, the man having been killed in the German army.  <br />Hilton also wrote several short stories featuring Mr. Chips, but they are no better.	2004-06-22

In fact, I think this was a bit better than the last several preceding this, partly because of the new surroundings.<br />Granted, the plots of the cat books are sometimes a bit weak, even outlandish.  And the details of every last thing Qwilleran had for breakfast, lunch and dinner can be a trifle tiresome after the tenth time or so, especially when the same sort of detail is applied to the cats' meals and snacks.<br />But I can tolerate all those because the characters seem real and because the atmosphere is so carefully drawn.  In this case, for example, we have the building owner, the &quot;countess,&quot; with overtones of Miss Havisham telling Pip (or Qwill, in this case) simply to &quot;Play.&quot;  And then there is the apartment building, the Casablanca, with its rickety elevators and other signs of age and disrepair.  I feel that I actually know the countess and can smell the Casablanca or find my way through the hallways in the dark.<br />One has to go by the sum total in evaluating a book, i.e., the credits minus the debits.  That being so, I have to give this a solid recommendation as I look forward to the next in the series.  The perfect mystery?  Not at all.  But pretty good.	2004-06-21

What a dismal life they lead.  But it is not all for naught, because out of those horrible things and the dismal surroundings emerges a most original, entertaining, mildly funny tale one could imagine.<br />Count Olaf and his minions are villains extraordinaire.  Violet and Klaus are perhaps the main heroes, but the reader may find himself drawn most to little Sunny, dangling from the tower, unable even to babble.  The atmosphere couldn't be worse--in the best sense.<br />Children's literature has too often been about good little boys and girls who prevail against the very mild problems they face.  Not so here.  These kids don't make a dent in their problems.  In fact, the problems just get worse and worse to and including the last page.  But real kids love tales of adversity.  A case in point:  the recent surge of interest in the Titanic disaster.<br />Well, this book is a disaster too.  Don't buy it.  Don't read it.

I'm glad I did.  The first book was just irritating, but Ms. Plum is redeemed by the second.<br />The plot moooooves.  It's funny in the right places.  The jeopardy is always present, always real.  We know, of course, that somehow Plum will get Mancuso, bad as he is, but no matter.  That is a flaw of all series crime novels:  the reader knows the hero will prevail.  Otherwise, there wouldn't be a next book.<br />But the plot isn't what fascinated me here.  It was the atmosphere.  It was the cast of characters.  Trenton, NJ is not exactly a tourist Mecca, and the author doesn't try to burnish the city's reputation.  It's cold.  It's dirty.  It's dangerous.  A good portion of the book takes place in sundry funeral parlors, not exactly places we like to visit in the best of cities.  But the author makes it real--I almost wrote &quot;come alive,&quot; but that would be tacky.  As for characters, they are all good, from Plum to her grandmother.  While the reader probably wouldn't care to socialize with most of those who populate this tale, it is undeniable that they are realistic.  Characters and atmosphere:  they are what make or break any work of fiction, and they certainly make this an enjoyable turn.<br />I look forward to catching up with book three, if only to follow the further saga of Plum's Grandma.	2004-06-16

Private detectives of essentially the same description may be found in the works of Dashiell Hammett, Mickey Spillane, James Lee Burke, Steve Hamilton and even Sue Grafton, among others, but somehow Stuart Kaminsky manages to make Toby Peters seem brand new each time out.<br />In each of the series Toby Peters is hired by a person famous in the 1930s or 1940s.  Among his clients have been Salvatore Dali, the Marx Brothers, Eleanor Roosevelt, W.C. Fields and Humphrey Bogart.  In this book, Charlie Chaplin hires Toby Peters to find out who is threatening the life of the clown genius.  In every case, the famous person is great fun.<br />The plots are more or less the same in each book, but somehow they feel new.  At least, they feel okay.  The atmosphere and the characters are what the reader finds interesting.  Peters has a semi-deaf landlady who thinks he is an exterminator and book editor.  In the same rooming house is a midget who works as a literary translater.  Peters rents office space with an incompetent dentist who smokes cigars as he tortures unsuspecting patients.  An ex-pornographer has offices upstairs.  A mechanic known as &quot;no neck&quot; works on the detective's car.  Peters wanders through a world of greasy restaurants, partiaking of tacos and Pepsi.  He listens to period radio shows and drives a Crosley.  It is a wonderful world of nostalgia, jeopardy, and humor.  There is no one quite like Kaminsky, and I would recommend his books to any mystery reader.	2004-06-14

I've just read it again, having forgotten most of the details of the plot, and did not find it nearly as good as I had remembered.<br />The novel did not seem to be &quot;fleshed out.&quot;  The denouement was a bit too bizarre.  Poirot is just a trifle too facile in his logic.  The characters seem leftover from a dozen other works.<br />The British train was, for some reason, the perfect setting for a murder mystery and was employed many times for that purpose.  The Orient Express does provide an excellent backdrop for this study in murder, not entirely separate from the Lindbergh case that was the &quot;crime of the century&quot; when this was published.  The method of laying out the plot is quite good, if a little too thin.  Most books tend to be overwritten--&quot;too many words.&quot;  This one needed more, somehow. As I turned the last page I found that I just was not convinced that this could have happened.  And being convincing  is the key to the literary success of any work of fiction.	2004-06-13

If the same magician pulls TWO rabbits out in a row, we smile.  But what happens if he does TEN?  FIFTY?  A HUNDRED?  That's what the author did here:  too many damn rabbits and only one hat.<br />The plot, which is supposed to be in the thriller genre, I surmise, gets laughable after about the 50th silly turn of events.  The characters are nothing memorable--pretty much stock, cardboard cutouts, central casting has-beens.  The atmosphere skips around so much that the reader can never quite discover the ambience.  The scholarship is often suspect or just plain wrong.<br />Early on the author must have decided to set this in a 24-hour time frame.  That certainly serves to compact the action.  But it also creates patent absurdities, such as a plane that flies at Mach 15.  Such as a superfluous romance that is something out of Ayn Rand.  Such as doing a year's research at the Vatican in about 10 minutes.  You get the point.<br />Perhaps the basic theme (religion vs. the challenges of science) could have been explored better at a far slower more provacative pace, without about 90% of the heroics and O. Henry surprises.<br />Sorry.  Too many rabbits here,  Way, way, way too many.	2004-06-08

By page 70 I was sick of the mess--revulsed.  Scatology, per se, is not humor.  Apparently the writer was not aware of that.<br />The book has no focus. It is an ignorant, pubescent boy's idea of a joke.  Moreover, it is a cruel and malicious attack without cause.  I cannot imagine anyone reading it who was not a reader of Lilian Jackson Braun's novels, and I cannot imagine any such reader being even mildly amused by this nonsense.  <br />Ms. Braun is not the greatest of mystery writers, and her books, sometimes just too cute, do lend themselves to satire.  But a lampoonist is supposed to be--well--clever.  And this is not even remotely a work of wit or a work of art or a work of anything worthwhile.	2004-05-27

Later he moves north 400 miles to a little town and inherits a fortune.  &quot;The Cat Who Saw Red&quot; is the last mystery novel that ties him to the gritty city, and it is the best of the city books--by a considerable margin.<br />Other readers have outlined and commented on the plot, so I will say only about it that the plot here is much better than in the previous city novels.  It moves better and the outcome is more logical, more satisfying.  But the author's forte is not plotting.  It is in the remarkable characters, unusual without being grotesque (a fine line to walk), not the least of whom are Qwill's Siamese cats.  To those who have read none of the series, it may sound just a little too cutesy, having prescient cats solve crimes, but the writer makes it work and work quite well.<br />The writer also excels in creating atmosphere, the city, the newspaper office, fancy and not so fancy restaurants and Maus Haus, a rather weird boarding house for people interested in food--and in pottery.<br />Like Dickens, Ms. Braun invents no astonishing plots.  Her great strength is in making characters come to life in interesting settings.  As in Dickens, characters and settings are sufficient.	2004-05-04

And I don't have a problem with the whimsical aspect of a cat &quot;who&quot; can read (or whatever), although I am somewhat taken aback by the pronoun in the titles, &quot;who&quot; as opposed to &quot;that.&quot;  <br />Where this and the other cat books fall a bit short is in the plotting, more specifically in the outcome or denouement.  Somehow I feel empty handed as I turn the final page.  Without giving away the plot, this was especially true here, in the first of the feline puzzlements.  If the cat mysteries just had a better explanation of events and motives, they would be worthy of five stars.<br />Nonetheless, for pure reading enjoyment the cat books are way, way above most current mysteries that are about as much fun to read as watching a toenail fungus cure commercial on TV.	2004-04-24

Sure as shootin' the detective is going to squirm out of the danger and nail the crook.  Real criminals would shoot and be done with it.  Real perps don't often feel the need to waste time in explanations, especially to someone who is going to be dead shortly.<br />Mystery writers continue to use this easy way out, especially when it's obvious that the evidence adduced is insufficient to convict anyone of anything in court.  This book is a good case in point.  Perhaps the writer just couldn't think of another way to end the book.<br />The characters are interesting enough, although Ms. Plum seems to be a clone escaped from Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series:  smart-mouthed, tough, enduring.  The plot, up to almost the end, is more than a trifle outlandish (a complete novice cutie pie hiring out as a bounty hunter in a tough city--NOT!).  The atmosphere (Trenton, NJ) is gritty and mean; the descriptions of the Garden State capital would induce few readers to want to visit.<br />The humor has its moments, although some asides seem misplaced, askew.    Perhaps the subsequent novels from the series are improved, but I will probably never know first hand after reading this one.	2004-04-05

Then hope that the plot absurdities will be overlooked by the reader.  And the flaws are overlooked, unless one looks beneath the surface.<br />For example:  A body is discovered behind the wallboard of an 18th century Charleston house.  When the wallboard is broken, a terrible stench fills the kitchen.  It would appear that there are two problems with this set of circumstances.  First of all, if the body has been there since the 1700s, it is highly unlikely that there would be a cloying, repugnant odor.  Such an odor would have been detected long ago.  The smell of a hundred pounds of decaying meat can penetrate almost anything.  Moreover, would there really have been wallboard on such an old house?  I'm no expert on Charleston house materials, but gypsum wallboard came much later.  The walls should have been lath and plaster and hair, it would seem.  If there was wallboard, that would indicate remodeling a century or more after the body was deposited there, and surely the remodeler would have noticed the body.<br />Perhaps a reader should not ponder such things, but I can't help it.

At first glance, this book appeared to be merely cute--having a cat that solves crimes--and something I wasn't going to like at all.<br />But I was pleasantly surprised by the relaxing atmosphere of Moose County, somewhere in the northern part of the U.S.  The characters were engaging.  The plot is perhaps just a trifle weird.  I still have a problem with the gimmick detectives, as opposed to the standard sleuth, i.e., the police detective or private eye vs. a cat, an antique dealer, a school marm, etc.  The real detective here is, of course, the newspaper columnist who gets hints from Koko, his cat.  I groaned a little at the concept, but the atmosphere and characters made me keep reading.<br />I wouldn't put this at the top of the list of mysteries, but the novel is a pleasant, light diversion, with &quot;cute&quot; being the major flaw.	2004-04-02

However, the jeopardy is just as real, and the corpse is just as dead--drowned in champagne of the wrong color, in this case.  Does &quot;cozy&quot; mean written by a woman?  There's certainly nothing cozy about Patricia Cornwell's or Sue Grafton's crime fiction.  Does it mean without a lot of &quot;improper&quot; words?  Then, Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, and Mary Roberts Rinehart would fit the genre.  So what IS a cozy mystery?<br />This one is good fun, especially if the reader is familiar with the book, &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.&quot;  The setting is quirky Savannah, and Tamar Myers populates her book with quirky locals to go with the quirky entourage from Charlotte/Rock Hill.  The characters are fascinating, the atmosphere almost palpable.  And the plot has one final twist that send the reader off satisfied.<br />But cozy?  Murder is never cozy.  Tea and crumpets are cozy.  &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a little cozy, perhaps.  But not Tamar Myers.	2004-03-29

The plot isn't all that much, I'll admit.  Otherwise, I'd have given it five stars.  However, I am just enthralled with Magdalena Portulacca Yoder, the skinny, middle-aged  Mennonite innkeeper who runs around Hernia, Pennsylvania, with a small kitty asleep in her bra.  If you haven't read the book, you won't believe that or understand it at all.  Trust me, she does.  And when that kitty is awakened suddenly, well....<br />The Amish and Mennonite neighbors (along with the \\"English\\" inn guests and neighbors) are also memorable--quirky but surely alive.  The town itself and the country inn provide a fine atmosphere, one I would like to visit.  My only reservation is the thinnish plot and a rather vague resolution, but at least we didn't get a confession and then a suicide.<br />I will definitely read more books by Tamar Myers.  Thank you.  You made me laugh outloud, and I haven't done that with a novel since \\"The Confederacy of Dunces.\\"	2004-03-19

Again and again the writer mulls over the suspects without coming to any conclusion.  One almost senses that space is being filled for the publisher, without the plot moving forward a single inch.<br />But that is tolerable, perhaps.  What is not tolerable is the murderer confessing in detail (while a tape recorder is running) and explaining just how the killing took place and why the crime was necessary--and then committing suicide.  Baloney!  It has been done far too many times.  Surely readers are sick of this by now.  The evidence here against the killer is flimsy at best, certainly not strong enough to stand up in court if the accused has a decent lawyer.  All the murderer has to do is deny, deny, deny.  The easy way out of this for the writer?  Those old stand-bys, confession and suicide.  Surely there has to be some alternative to this facile denouement.	2004-03-13

Police procedurals can be fascinating, owing to the fine tuned details that seem to lend a certain reality, but they can also become cumbersome with all the interviews and reports that go no where.  \\"The Cask\\" gets just a little out of hand as one detective repeats the work of another, without moving the plot forward.<br />In real life, murderers are not nearly so clever in their planning as we see here, especially when the crime (strangulation) was not pre-meditated.  Nor are detectives as clever or lucky as the private eye who solves this case by breaking down an alibi, piece by piece, in most unlikely fashion.  <br />Ultimately the author stacks the cards a bit too carefully, a bit too obviously.  Moreover, it's one thing to \\"prove\\" a case for the sake of a novel reader and quite another to make a case that can be taken to court for a conviction by a jury.  The case here would never stand up to rigorous cross examination by a competent defense attorney.  This is, of course, too often the case in mystery novels, past and present.  Crofts solves that little problem by having the murderer confess in detail for the reader and then commit suicide, a most unsatisfactory and dishonest way out of the problem.  The device was used again and again in \\"golden age\\" mysteries and is still seen today.  <br />Crofts' characters are well drawn and seem real enough.  The atmosphere of London and Paris is excellent.  The problems lie in the shifting narration, the over-plotting, and the vexacious ending.  Crofts did much better and more controlled work in subsequent novels, leading me to wonder why this is considered his best by some reviewers.	2004-02-06

But the thief-murderer duo are apprehended long before the end, and the last part is his rather mundane account of how the jewels were stolen in India and life at the prison on the Andaman Islands.  There's actually very little &quot;mystery&quot; or detection to it, since we know who the thief-murderer are early on.  The boat chase on the Thames is not especially interesting or convincing, nor is the romance between Dr. Watson and the pretty client.  What saves this is the almost palpable atmosphere of London in the time of Jack the Ripper, plus the outrageous conclusions drawn by Sherlock Holmes.	2004-01-11

The author's first two mysteries in this series were absolutely excellent.  Since then there has been an inevitable by slight drop in quality.  A reader could almost FEEL the first two novels, see the UP, the bars, hear the night sounds.  While &quot;Blood is the Sky&quot; is superior to most mysteries in its atmosphere, it's a bit down.  That may be because a good portion of it is set in Canada and seems a little vague sometimes, as if the writer were out of his territory.  <br />The characters here are just fine.  There are no cardboard cutouts to represent this or that person, a fault too often seen in fiction, in current mysteries especially.<br />The plot, well described by others, gets a bit too involved sometimes but is satisfying in the end.  It would be easy to get a little lost sometimes.<br />All in all, this is a well-above-average crime novel.  I do hope the author will return to the UP of Michigan as the sole setting for his next opus.	2003-07-31

The books are delightful, pure entertainment for intelligent children and adults.  That alone is remarkable.  If anyone sees evil in Harry Potter, that person has a serious personality flaw in my view.  We read fiction for fun, for the magic of it, no matter how intellectual we may get in describing a work.  If it ain't fun, if it doesn't transport us, then it ain't worth it.  Harry Potter is fun.<br />I hesitate to add that the latest installment is perhaps a bit too long by some 200 pages.  A good editor could have fixed that easily.  It took too long to get to Hogwarts, where I long to be.  I tolerate the other places.  Other than that, I loved it.	2003-07-28

Although I might add one more:  disappointing.  This is my first Marcia Muller mystery, and I expected more from a seasoned writer--too much, as it turned out.  After reading Steve Hamilton, Bill Pronzini, Andrew Greeley, Tony Hillerman, Stuart Kaminsky, Les Roberts, and others of that level, this seems stale as yesterday's gruel.<br />There's no point in reviewing the plot details.  Other reviewers have commented adequately on those.  So I'll proceed to the other two major points of any mystery--atmosphere and characters.  Set in Hawaii, for the most part, I just never quite got there, despite all the green vegetation, flowers and fiery volcanoes.  Beautiful, beautiful, so what?  The characters are pretty much standard fare for mysteries--too rich, too spoiled, too much alcohol and drugs.  As for love affairs, mystery writers might do well to heed S.S. Van Dine's rule from decades ago and leave sex out of the work.  If the mystery is thin, the romance won't thicken it.  The murder and the detection are, after all, why we read crime fiction.  If I want romance, I'll go with Bertrice Small.<br />In short, I doubt that I'll try another Marcia Muller book, at least, not for a long, long time.  Sorry.	2003-07-28

The title alone should demonstrate the latter.  In other novels, Mr. Latimer's private detective gets himself committed to a private insane asylum to protect a client.  In another work, a wealthy man on death row, five days from electrocution, decides he wants to live and hires a private detective to prove the innocence of the condemned man.<br />The subject novel opens with a scholarly professor arriving at a remote Michigan mansion at night during a storm.  He is there at the invitation of his wealthy great-uncle, as are numerous other relatives, presumably to learn about their inheritances.  Quite soon the great-uncle is found dead in his study.  His head is--well--missing--along with his new will.  Everyone assumes the murderer is an escaped lunatic who killed his family by decapitation.  The reader knows better.<br />The plot is funny and ingenious, a trademark of this writer's works.  The Great Depression era atmosphere is fine.  The characters are somewhat standard, except for the narrator, i.e., the scholarly professor whose area of expertise is the English Restoration.  <br />This work is highly recommended for fans of the golden age crime novel.  In fact, read all of Latimer's early works.  He went a little sappy later, even writing Perry Mason episodes for TV and scripts for \\"Topper\\" movies.	2003-06-16

The plot to demonstrate this well-known supposition is just too contrived, too diluted with gratuitous rutting and pointless violence, and too error-filled on minor points of fact.<br />The novel opens on May 29 at a fancy Long Island beach house.  A young man is about to be brutally murdered.  The noise of the crime will be absorbed by the pounding surf.  Then this remarkable line on Page 11:  &quot;The sloppy remains of Hurricane Gwyneth, which battered Cape Hatteras for a week, just hit the Hamptons this morning.&quot;  Imagine that.  The hurricane season as described on the Weather Channel has not yet opened, and there is already a hurricane well over a week old, one that lasted for seven days in North Carolina.  Not only that but there have been six (count them) six other hurricanes or tropical storms before this for the season, since such events are named alphabetically.  It is difficult to take anything too seriously after this sort of error.  And there are others.<br />I had not read a James Patterson novel before this.  Perhaps I did not begin with a good one.  Or perhaps he just cranks them out without paying much attention to the facts.	2003-06-16

Ms. Vowell has a nice dry sense of humor, but that alone does not make her a fine writer.  Perhaps it is unfair to compare her with Molly Ivins--yet.

None of those is quite the right word, but they will have to do.  Other readers have reviewed the plot, so I'll skip that.  Perhaps the characters are what are so electric.  One just has to like Jim Chee, the patient Navajo policeman, and his lieutenant emeritus, Joe Leaphorn.  By now they are old friends to Hillerman's many readers.  In the book just previous to this, we are introduced to Janet Pete's replacement--Ms. Pete went off to the city and left Jim Chee brokenhearted.  Chee's new love interest (most obliquely) reprises here and is even more charming than last time.<br />Still, it may not be the characters that drive a Hillerman mystery.  Perhaps it is the very land itself, the Four Corners high desert of New Mexico, the Navajo people, their culture, the sacred mountains, the dusty, rutted roads, the hogans, the ceremonies and shamans and fears and prejudices.<br />All I know is that I eagerly await Hillerman's novels, and I'm a bit sorry I read this one already, since the wait for the next one will be even longer.	2003-06-05

The dialogue is wooden, sometimes laughable.  Coincidences and cliches abound in amateurish fashion.  Spelling, grammar and syntax cry out for a competent editor.  <br />Characterizations are stiff, one dimensional, nonsensical.  Among the Confederate pirates, for example, is a French Canadian who calls people, \\"Mon ami,\\" and even says \\"Sacre bleu.\\"  Why he is there makes no sense at all.  He seems to have walked in out of a Bullwinkle cartoon.<br />But worst of all is the shallow understanding of history, of fact, of reality.  Granted, a fiction writer can take certain liberties with raw history, but the author of this novel goes off the edge.  These errors go from major points to tiny details.  The Lake Erie piracy of 1864, as described in this book, does not remotely resemble, for example, what actually occurred.  The \\"battle,\\" such as it was, took place on Middle Bass Island, not South Bass.  John Brown, Jr. had no escaped slaves working for him, and it was he who went to warn officials at Johnson's Island prison, not a former slave.  Co. K, 130th OVI boys captured were in mufti and had not been sent to Put-in-Bay.  They were on the \\"Island Queen,\\" bound for Toledo to be mustered out after 100 days service.  The \\"Island Queen,\\" so important to the story, was omitted completely.  Rowing a boat from Put-in-Bay to Johnson's Island would have taken many hours, not minutes as the novel implies.  It took John Brown, Jr. at least 12 hours to make the journey.  <br />Among the tiny details:  the CSA never issued coins; the Perry Monument at Put-in-Bay is NOT the second tallest monument in the U.S.--at least 3 others are taller; the number of guns on USS MICHIGAN is wrong.  The names of the \\"pirates\\" are incorrect.  Nitpicking?  Ah, but the devil is in the details, as the lawyers say.<br />Pehaps if one were not aware of the history and had never been to Put-in-Bay, some of this wouldn't matter.  But the glaring errors of the craft of writing would still remain.  Misspelling is still misspelling.  Alas, carelessness is the fatal flaw in any endeavor, writing included.	2003-05-31

Without reviewing the plot, I'll admit it moves quickly, despite extraneous information on virtually every page.  I could have done without Dr. Delaware's sexual unions with his wife, for example, and without his detailed word maps of Los Angeles streets.  These are minor flaws.  The major flaw is that there is not one single character here that a reader can like or find entertaining.  The victim, the cops, Dr. Delaware himself, the young woman Dr. Delaware is counseling, her nasty brother, her nasty father, etc.  The novel left a rather bitter aftertaste, as if I had eaten something that was on the verge of being spoiled and vaguely poisonous.  Would I read another by Kellerman?  Perhaps--just to see if this is the norm or if Dr. Mate's death (see matar in a Spanish dictionary) brought out the worst in people.	2003-03-08

I'm not opposed from some religious standpoint.  The literary sin is that the writer just tries way too hard and ends up being silly.  There's no flow, no spontaneity.  It's an amateurish version of a Mel Brooks skit, nothing more.  See &quot;Oh God&quot; the movie for a better story, for better humor.

He needed a good editor to tone this down a notch or  two.  It is not necessary to demonstrate for the reader that one knows all  the underworld jargon.<br />The second problem is in the ragged  &quot;edge&quot; the novel has.  In Burke's other novels with the same  hero, there was a hardness also, but it was softened by his affection for  wife and daughter, by his serene occupation away from catching murderers.   There is not much of that in &quot;Purple Cane Road.&quot;  It's downright  mean from start to finish.<br />I had hoped for something more, not that the  author would give us the same old same old, but that he wouldn't sound so  damned angry at the world.  Still, I'm an avid fan of his previous books  and look forward to the next.	2000-08-15

Without the proper ambience,  even the best mystery would fall flat.   CHARACTERS--The detective and all  he meets are well-drawn and believlable.  I never doubted for a second.   PLOT--There are two distinct plots, actually, that eventually merge with a  common theme.  The ending is no great surprise, alas, but it works well  enough and shouldn't be considered a negative.<br />To this fine mix, Les  Roberts has added the spice of uncertainty on the part of his hero.

The fireman casts aside a girl he's about to marry  to take up with a scarred survivor of the circus fire.  Why?  Why was the  first girl even introduced?  And the novel just goes on from there.<br />Most  irritating, perhaps, is the daughter, Martha, whose only reason for being  seems to be to explain to the dumb reader the psychological workings  beneath the surface.  I got to the point that I just didn't care.  Martha  reminded me of Scarpatta's niece in a Patricia Cornwell thriller:  smarmy,  irritating, and ultimately a pain in the you know what.<br />The denouement of  this novel is just too, too pat.  Still, it's an improvement over the  middle third of the book, which is where we are treated to all the pop  psychology.  Alas, this could have been so much better if it had been  thought out better.	2000-08-06

There is no hyperbole, no wringing of hands.  The author simply lets the story tell itself through those who were there, for the most part.<br />Here  is but a single stunning example, from p.109:  &quot;Several survivors said  the one thing they will never forget about the circus fire as long as they  live is the sound of the animals as they burned alive.  But there were no  animals.&quot; How much more effective that is, as prose, than the  alternative method of saying the same thing.<br />Stories of individual  selfishness and total selflessness abound, as they do in an accurate  account of any great tragedy.  The author does not omit either, so that the  reader comes away with a feel for what it must have been like that hot July  afternoon in Hartford, one month after D-Day.<br />I had misgivings about how  well this could be told, before I read the book.  Not now.  I'd recommend  this to any circus fan, to anyone who wants to read something really well  written and thoroughly researched.<br />My only criticism is that the photos,  many taken by amateurs, to be sure, are not well produced.

The author re-creates the era of 1921, when the Cincinnati nine were still reeling from having been cheated out of their victory over the  Chicago &quot;Black Sox&quot; by accusations that the fix was in.  Having  felt the summer heat of Cincinnati and having seen many games at Redlands  (Crosley Field), this brought it all back.  I can't wait to read Troy Soos'  other mysteries.	2000-05-14

It is a little too polite by today's standards:  the detective and his confidants are never in jeopardy.  There is but the one murder and no  real foreshadowing of another possible homicide.  The plot might well have  been improved by more action or at least the threat of something dire.  Despite this, the ambience and characterizations are superior to most  present-day whodunits. The only flaw in the characterizations is in Ms.  Marsh's attempts to write grating American slang.   If the reader likes  Agatha Christie and the novels that are more puzzle than danger, this is a  very good choice.	2000-04-02

After all, it is a work of fiction, and a writer can make the South prevail at Gettysburg, for the sake of a good  story.  The real faults are in the very narration, i.e., the point of view  shifts that are pretentious and annoying--and in the descent into romantic  hogwash. Perhaps the readers of sappy romances will like the shift in  Amelia's character and even believe it possible that such could occur, but  it is not very satisfying to a reader who wants more from a book than sap.  I just couldn't buy the premise, the point of views, and the denouement.  I  wish it were otherwise, because I wanted to like this.	2000-03-11

It wears a little thin, the mindless wisecracks.  The Groucho persona of the Marx Brothers movies was certainly zany, but there  was no serious jeopardy implied.  It just doesn't work, somehow, in a  detective novel, no matter how hard Mr. Goulart tries.	2000-03-04

It is filled with a great many Groucho-like wisecracks, but the ambience of Hollywood and the story fell too far short  to make this worthwhile reading.  The plot and characters were just a wee  bit hard to follow, and I ended up not caring much one way or another who  dunnit.  Readers who like the Marx Brothers and mysteries would be better  served by Stuart Kaminsky's &quot;You Bet Your Life.&quot;	2000-02-19

Supposedly the author has written other  mysteries under a pseudonym.  Does anyone know the name of his other  mysteries?  I would read them all. Usually I have figured out the plot  about half way through a mystery.  I'm not unique.  Most readers of  mysteries can do the same.  But this time I was  wonderully misdirected.   As the pace picked up about half way through, I found myself enjoying the  tale immensely and hoping beyond hope that the writer wasn't going to screw  up the ending.  He didn't.  Thank you, Mr. Allen.  And Bravo!	1999-12-11

There was a comedian who used to do a routine about his  grandfather who called the youth to the dying old man's bedside.   &quot;Remember this,&quot; the old man whispered in the youth's ear,  &quot;a wet bird never flies at night.&quot;  &quot;I never understood  it,&quot; the comedian said, &quot;but I never forgot it.&quot; And so it  is with Morrie and Mitch.  Call me insensitive and non-spiritual, whatever  that means, but I've read better stuff with more genuine emotions.	1999-12-07

It was funny, intriguing, and insightful. Where this goes  wrong is in the middle, when Kinsey keeps visiting her old haunt, the  &quot;Tonk&quot; bar.  The patrons were dull and repetitive, and, worse  yet, the action seemed to stop completely.  One got the sense that the book  was supposed to be x pages long, and this was inserted to reach the  requisite number. The last part is OK, but it just can't quite save the  book.  Too bad.  I will continue to read Kinsey Millhone adventures and  hope for better luck next time.	1999-11-01

This is no magazine article, padded to book-length.  Rather, it is the incredible story of two driven men, with only one thing in common:  their  love of words. I was as fascinated with every page of it as I am of the  OED, each time I have occasion to use it.  In fact, I immediately read the  Murray bio, &quot;Caught in the Web of Words&quot; and recommend that as  well. I am just thankful that I am not so intellectually jaded, suffering  with such ennui, that I could not revel in Winchester's remarkable tale.	1999-10-16

This is just too long, too overblown.  Apparently the author thought that more was better, and he just piled it on. Blame some of this  on the editor at the publishing  house.  If about 100-150 pages had been  omitted, this might have been worth reading. As Gertrude Stein told  Hemingway:  &quot;Prune, Ernest, prune.&quot;	1999-10-16

But the fact is that Ronald Reagan was never a very bright man or a good parent.  He was what  Nancy made of him, and that was not very much at all.  This memoir of  Reagan is, if anything, too kind. There is reason to believe that Reagan  never really understand anything other than a simplistic account of  anything.  Read the book by George Schulz, who had a horrible time trying  to convince Reagan of simple, indisputable facts about foreign policy.  &quot;My mind is made up,&quot; was appatently the &quot;great  communicator's&quot; motto.  &quot;Don't try to confuse me with the  facts.&quot;	1999-10-11

I've read all of Cornwell's novels and have generally enjoyed them--up to this one.  I was looking forward to a good read, and all I got  was this.<br />Enough mewling about the niece and the dead lover!  Get back to  basics, Ms. Cornwell.  And lay off all the meaningless details.  If a good  editor had taken about 100-150  pages of padding out of this, it might have  been okay, although the plot is just a wee bit far-fetched.  Maybe more  than a wee bit.	1999-09-13

Most of the characters are cardboard cutouts, e.g., the pretty, young  writer who does not believe in ghosts, the tweedy academic who is drawn in  because the writer is pretty, the &quot;Chinaman&quot; (actually called  that in the book) who speaks like Charlie Chan for no particular reason in  the plot, etc .  The writing is laced with cliches that will make any  discerning reader groan.  The science, as explained by a learned professor  isn't--well--isn't scientific at all.  Quotations meant to give the opus  some sort of vague scholarship are occasionally attributed to the wrong  author.  Even part of the setting is &quot;borrowed&quot; from  &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; and &quot;Time and Again.&quot;    Maybe this  sort of thing &quot;plays,&quot; but one has to wonder where--and to whom.	1999-06-02

It is, in fact, a frist rate novel in every respect. The reader will be faced with two enormous unanswered questions before the last  page.  One has to believe that the author intended it that way, to make the  reader think about those questions for days and days. If you only read one  novel this year, make it this one.	1999-05-16

This book goes nowhere that most readers haven't been before.  Most readers will already know who JonBenet was and that she was murdered, before they get hold of this tome.  After reading it, they won't  know anthing more significant than before. The author seems to have  gathered every scrap of information from newspapers, magazines and  interviews and then assembled it quickly without much sorting and without  making sense of it.  To add to the confusion, the book is replete with  typos that tend to show just how quickly this was made up at the printery.  The question remains:  who killed this little girl?  We may not like the  Ramseys or their values or their style of living, but there is no PROOF  that they caused the death of JonBenet.  Analysis of handwriting won't do  it.  Any defense lawyer would tear that to pieces.  Fingerprints and DNA on  the body won't prove anything either.  Forget about lie detector tests and  a neighbor who says he heard a scream in the night.  It is still possible  that someone outside the household came in, using one of the multitude of  housekeys that were floating about, and killed the girls for reasons yet  unknown. Without a confession there will never be a conviction in this  case.  Speculation may be interesting as a parlor game, but a jury is going  to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.   Mr. Schiller's book did not  bring the reader one step closer to the truth.  His previous books, some of  which were apparently assembled by a real writer, were masterpieces--but  not this one.	1999-03-01

Ms. Flowers, by no account, &quot;slept&quot; with the president.  Rather, she claims to have had an affair with Bill Clinton while he was a politician in Arkansas.  Even she does not claim to  have seen Mr. Clinton since he went to Washington.  If she ever had an  affair with him, it was a voluntary agreement between adults. Her amateur  psychoanalysis of Clinton is stupid and embarrassing.  Perhaps she has read  too many cheap novels and &quot;women's magazines&quot; that glibly explain  all by having the reader answer a few &quot;revealing&quot; questions.  It  is an insult to the president's mother to blame her somehow for her son's  appetites in women.  And speaking of which, if he is to be faulted for his  taste, it is in opting for the likes of Gennifer Flowers. Her allegation  that Clinton slips from the White House, without the Secret Service, to be  driven by Bruce Lindsey to an assignation, is ridiculous.  Try to picture  someone of Mr. Lindsey's talents sitting in the car, in a cold parking  garage, while his friend is upstairs having fun.  It is beyond all belief,  and even Ms. Flowers cannot attest to it.  She can, however, gleefully  repeat any rumor that reflects illy upon Clinton. These are but a small  sampling of the ridiculous allegations in this piece of trash.  My copy is  in the garbage can. Long ago I came to realize that all this is not about  sex, or lying under oath, or obstruction of justice.  It is about getting  Bill Clinton.  By whom? Big tobacco companies?  They have the money and  motive.  Religious Right?  Ditto.  Gun Lobby?  Ditto.  Ms. Flowers may not  be in their pay, but she is most certainly doing what they approve. Don't  put another dime in Ms Flowers' pocket.  Let the tobacco companies, the TV  evangelists et al. &quot;keep&quot; her if she pleases them.  As an aside,  I have never met Mr. Clinton and am not in his pay.  I am merely a citizen  who is trying to be fair and make some sense of the whole mess.whole mess.	1999-02-08

Having read Jack Finney's &quot;Time and Again&quot; before reading this, I was more than  a little disappointed with &quot;Somewhere in Time.&quot;  It took far too long for the author to set up the premise, and the actual  romance takes place over two days.  The book would have been much improved  if Matheson could have come to the crux sooner and more convincing if he  had given more details on the relationship between the three main  characters. This is one of the rare cases where the movie was actually  better than the book.  Of course, Jane Seymour's beauty may have had  something to do with that. If a reader is going to read one time travel  romance, stick with Finney's novel.  It is a truly wonderful tale and far  more creative.	1999-01-07

Not so, I found upon reading it.  In fact, the book is based only loosely  on the Moxley murder and has a life all its own.  The relationship the  sometime narrator has with an obscenely wealthy, powerful, immoral family  is far more interesting than the murder, which is at the center of the  narrative. Dunne does not come across as a great novelist, if one judges  him by his TV interviews.  This book is not at all befuddled.  Dunne knew  exactly what he was doing with every word.	1998-12-23

This may not be the perfect account of the Black Dahlia murder, but it is far and away the best of all those in print, including &quot;Daddy....&quot;  I read the copy from the local library and had to order a copy of my own.  Anyone interested in unsolved murders (isn't everyone?) may well find this a fascinating work.  The photos are almost too gruesome as are the accounts of her murder.  It is hard to imagine the sort of mind that would control a person to do what was done to Miss Short.  As for the author's speculation, there is some, but that seems permissable in a 50-year-old unsolved murder case.	1998-04-06
