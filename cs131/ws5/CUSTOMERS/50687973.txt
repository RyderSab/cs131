Following in the tradition of other Christian allegories, such a Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress or the classic Hind's Feet in High Places, J. C. Lynn (Jessica Sandoval) offers her Veiling Society for today's adolecents.<br />The story follows Ashley, who has recently lost her mother in a drunk driving accident and subsequently moved from Florida to Washington, who one day stumbles into the land of Specifia, wherein the abstract concepts of earth are incarnate.  There she is guided by Sense and Crazy, both of whom work for Wisdom, to combat the Destroyer, his demon, IT, and their city, Society, in order to free the seven sisters (generally named after the gifts/fruits of the Spirit) and restore the crumbled city of Innocence.  Along the way, Ashley comes up against several humorous puns in the vein of Lewis Carroll - such as literal saddlehorses - and fanciful gizmos to rival Harry Potter's world - such as the weather making airplane.<br />Fun and games take up approximately half of the book, but the true story begins once in Society.  Ashley, Sense and Crazy are captured by IT and given new, brainwashed personas.  They are Providentially saved by Conscience; and Ashley is guided to &quot;the building&quot; to face the cardinal vices and free the sisters - of whom Ashley has been revealed as one: Youth.  The story ends with Ashley's return home and the hope for the conversion of her small family.  Although Lynn hints that the devil is still lurking out there, and that both Ashley and the reader should keep on guard.<br />Wonderfully, the morality for this book is excellent.  The connections between the various allegorial figures, the virtues which are employed to overcome the vices - everything leads to a correct (and relieving!) morality.  The content is tense, but not graphic; and the language and characters are eminently suitable for the book's target audience of pre-adolecents.  However, for the adult, a few of the allegorical figures/places (such as the Love Forest) might cause a groan or two, and Lynn makes no bones about veiling God's voice or His Son's: both speak directly and in BOLD LETTERS to Ashley throughout nearly the entirity of the story.  The first section of the book includes almost no conflict as the companions journey through Specifia, to the story's slight detriment.  However, this lack is more than made up in the second half of the story which takes place wholly in Society, and which begins to take on a mild form of Orwellian atmosphere.<br />Pre-teens and those who enjoy allegorical puzzles will enjoy The Veiling Society.	2001-02-16

Thirty-seven years ago, the Pelloir House of the Basilisk wiped out the Trevalyn House of the Griffin - all except for the heir to the house. Now, having finally come to grips with himself, Rook Caladrius (nee Griffin Tormalyne) sets out from the Bard's Island of Luly to confront his past. Involving intrigue, adventure, and a gripping set of characters, Song for the Basilisk is an excellent read, whether you've read McKillip before or are a long-time fan.<br />Alas, there are a few drawbacks to the book. McKillip's intention, as the title suggests, is an exploration of music upon the world. However, McKillip falls short of her mark, often wandering off to explore fabrics, color, art and language over the effect of tone and harmony. On the positive side, however, &quot;Song for the Basilisk&quot; is one of McKillip's few novels that does *not* include a completely incomprehensible ending (no &quot;opening the mouth and speaking leaves&quot; or some such interesting but utterly confusing image) - making this book an excellent introduction for the first time McKillip reader.<br />Recommended for everyone, particularly lovers of McKillip's other works, those who enjoy Robin McKinley's style, and those searching for political fantasy.	2001-01-10

Readers who are familiar with other &quot;quest&quot; or &quot;travel&quot; fantasies (see especially High Fantasy authors), will particularly enjoy Volsky's highly realistic &quot;take&quot; on what it means to travel. Rather than littering her pages with idealised, happy-go-lucky travelling companions who are somehow able to walk with little to no discomfort, or better, to ride without saddleburn, Volsky's characters are held-up by weather, hostile natives, and delayed trains. Finally! <br />Unlike Volsky's previous three books, &quot;The Grand Ellipse&quot; involves relatively little horror or gore, and the one attempted rape scene is intense but in no way gratuitous.  Those who have been leery of reading Volsky due to her post-&quot;Illusion&quot; books should certainly invest in her latest offering, while those who enjoyed the previous three books will still find the grand scope of this novel invigorating.  Recommended *heartily* for everyone - even if you don't generally read fantasy!  There are very few great authors in the market; Volsky is high among them.  So why delay?!	2001-01-10

All but one from first person perspective (Lal and Soukyan's last hurrah), Beagle continues to weave strange twists on old forms: the girl who would rather marry a thief, the powerful magician who had no love for power, two old mercenary partners who find a need for reconciliation, and - my favourite - the actors who are privy to a most unusual theatrical performance! As delightful and lyrical as these tales are, however, Beagle's world is bleak, leaving all his characters to live in a catch-as-catch can world. Beagle also feels no need to shrink from or tidy-up the language of his characters, as the first story eminently proves. While this excellent ear for the &quot;voices&quot; of the five story-tellers in this wonderful collection is more than appropriate but necessary to each story, young children who loved &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; would be advised to wait a few years before delving into this enjoyable anthology.	2001-01-10

Walker is one of those few. And thank God, too! While Diana Paxson is busy writing against the historic conversion of the Norse to our &quot;White Christ,&quot; Walker is there fighting *for* Christianity.<br />Following the aetheistic Irishman, Aillil, who to save his life pretends to be a priest, we are taken to the historic Erling Skjalgsson's home, where the war between the old pagan ways, and the civilisation of Christ is in full battle. More than the Norse are converted, though, as &quot;Father&quot; Aillil becomes ordained in truth, and learns just what it means to walk Christ's road.<br />Teenagers and younger are warned to wait to read this book, as several scenes depict sexual desire (although not consummation), horrific violence, and a fair amoung of ale swilling. The plot is good, but episodic, making for a slightly slower time reading than perhaps we are currently used to. Gentlemen, especially, will want to check out the longer version of Father Aillil's and Erling's adventures in the two-novel book, The Year of the Warrior.	2001-01-10

Following three characters (on a nearly-systematic rotating chapter basis), Prince Talis Pelucir, Mage Atrix Wolfe, and the fey Saro, the reader is taken on a quest to discover the true nature of The Hunter (created by Atrix Wolfe), find the daughter of the Queen of the Forest, and save the kingdom from a second destruction. Along the way, Talis struggles with his romantic feelings for the Queen of the Forest, Atrix struggles against the Hunter who is his &quot;darker&quot; self, and Saro who is mute struggles against language to warn the men of danger. The scenes of Saro in the kitchen are at once heartwarming, enchanting, and impressive (or so says this complete culinary ignoramus!). Not enough time is given to Talis' own magecraft, and Atrix's story tends to become repetitious towards the middle. However, despite some minor quirks, The Book of Atrix Wolfe is a far more enjoyable, followable, and completed story than Winter Rose. Its theme of the power of words is compelling, its comment on the wrongness of inverting the meaning of words intriguing. As always, McKillip's prose alone is worth the price of the book! A good starting place for those interested in her work.	2001-01-10

However, in typical McKinley fashion, the focus of her concern is less the royal preparations and worries surrounding Briar-Rose (here, Rosie's) singular curse, but around Katriona, the fairy who becomes Rosie's foster mother, and Rosie's provincial tom-boyish life. This behind-the-scenes look at the popular tale is at once sweet and exciting, as Rosie gains the ability to talk to animals (less campy than it originally sounds), both she and Katriona fall in love with the men of their town (if not their dreams), and we are introduced to such memorable characters as Aunt, Narl, and Peony.<br />The only difficulty with the novel rests in its final forty pages, which - in a dreamlike style that seems to be inevitable in these retold fairy tales - attempts to explain the defeat of the evil fairy Pernicia in actions which are mostly incomprehensible. Parents might also find some difficulty in the second &quot;wake-up kiss&quot; (the first being rather more interesting), which is between Rosie and Peony. The moment is brief, and non-homoerotic, however may cause some consternation on the part of young American readers, especially. The conclusion is apparent from about midway through the book, if one is in the least familiar with McKinley's idea of what &quot;happily ever after&quot; means. <br />But niggling quibbles aside, Spindle's End is a truly charming tale, told in those sweet, swift strokes of which McKinley is a master. Those who preferred her recent &quot;darker&quot; books may find this a slight disappointment. But those who enjoyed &quot;Beauty,&quot; and McKinley's earlier books will most certainly enjoy &quot;Spindle's End.&quot;	2001-01-10

A charming retelling of the Cinderella story, &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; explains several of the more touchy points of that legend in a fun, intelligent, suspenseful and romantic way that makes the book a real page-turner. Why, for example, did Cinderella never just up and leave her rotten situation? Ms. Levine posits that unbeknownst to the brother Grimm, little baby Ella was under a curse to always obey - everything from &quot;Eat your peas&quot; to &quot;Jump off a bridge.&quot; The romantic element, promising love based on looks, Ms. Levine rectifies by acquainting Prince Charmont and Ella early on. Also incorporating intelligent language, good worldbuilding, a bestiary of mythical animals, and two fairy godmothers, Ella Enchanted is a sweet romp through Fairy Tales' most common story. A delightful read for every age!	2000-11-22

Following in the tradition of the literary social prophets, such as Orwell, Huxley and Bradbury, Walker joins the growing ranks of Christian apocalyptics, such as Michael O'Brien's &quot;Father Elijah,&quot; Frank Peretti's &quot;Piercing the Darkness,&quot; and Bud MacFarlane Jr.'s &quot;Pierced by a Sword.&quot;<br />Carl Martell, history professor at the non-Christian Christiana College, cannot tell a lie.  But he can sense when others do.  And when acclaimed Norweigan Poet, Sigfod Oski, comes to town, Martell is certain the greatest deceiver of all is in their midst.  Peopled with such endearing characters as the quiet but courageous Lutheran pastor, a born-again disk jockey, and the mythological wolf, Fenris, &quot;Wolf Time&quot; pulls you into Walker's all-too-realistic vision of where America is heading, and what believers will be called upon to endure.<br />Like almost all novels with an agenda (Christian or otherwise), though, the prose sometimes suffers for the Bible verses scattered throughout.  Every conversation between two characters revolves around culture and religion, which single-mindedness may put-off would be readers.  However, Walker's insights are sound, and his morals excellent - and, better, both are handled with a greater delicacy and tension as the book progresses.  Walker is not afraid to present all sides of the argument, to make witches sympathetic while arguing against their theological view, to examine the fundamentalist fanatics' reasoning for fighting fire with fire while showing Christs' equally decisive but remarkably non-violent solution.<br />Christians, especially Lutherans, will enjoy Walker's take on the near-future.  Viking and Norse Mythology enthusiasts will find &quot;Wolf Time&quot; an intelligent look at that religion.  Recommended to teenagers and adults, due to several referencesto sex and violence.  People searching for a follow-up non-fiction work may want to check out Peter Kreeft's &quot;Ecumentical Jihad.&quot;	2000-10-08

There's a terribly interesting subgenre that's dedicated to retelling the classic Fairy Tales, led by such notables as Robin McKinley and Mary Jo Napoli, but as marvellous as those &quot;adult&quot; retellings are, &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; - a supposedly children's-only book - manages to  capture all the romance, all the danger, and all the wit in a lighter field  and do so excellently.<br />Cursed at birth with the geas to &quot;always  obey,&quot; young Ella is at the tender mercy of every command from,  &quot;Eat your dinner,&quot; to &quot;Jump off a bridge.&quot;  Levine  plays on this point excellently, building nerve-wracking scenes off of this  seemingly harmless curse.  Amazingly, the whole Cinderella story works far  better for this single addition (consider: why didn't Cinderella in the  Perrault and other versions just LEAVE?), but Levine adds more.  Two fairy  godmothers are in attendance; Prince Charmont (aptly named) dances  attendance from the first; ogres, goblins, fairies and giants abound (each  with their own language!  Admirable indeed!); and, surprisingly, a goodly  part of the novel is done in epistolary form!  Add to *this* witty,  intelligent language, and beautiful worldbuilding and one has but a small  idea of the joy of this book.<br />The combination of so many new elements  might trip a lesser author up, but Levine's &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot;  moves along at a clip pace, and most assuredly deserves the term,  &quot;page-turner.&quot;  Lovers of high and traditional fantasy, dabblers  in Fairy Tales old and retold, children's literature enthusiasts, romantics  and adventurers would all do well to seek out and read this book.   Appropriate for all ages - a sheer delight to read!	2000-06-26

The characters  and their interrelations are drawn especially well.<br />In &quot;The  Summons,&quot; Bunnie Bessel built upon an interesting moral dilemma that a  bodyguard must face.  I only wish this story had been a novel - the  glimpses into the world seemed to display something larger than a short  story.<br />&quot;Luz&quot; by Patricia Duffy Novak examines humility,  perseverence, and divine favour in a charming and well-wrought story that,  given its content, manages to keep away from moralising while instructing  at the same time.<br />Charles Richard Laing's &quot;Weapons at War&quot;  draws from the well-worn &quot;gimmick&quot; of sentient swords, and takes  it one comical step further, making one swordwoman's whole armament into a  highly opinionated convention!<br />Enjoy!	2000-06-02
US	50687973	RO8E879R2WTBP	044100069X	150984734	Deerskin	Books	3	19	24	N	N	Regarding a Work of Literature	Previous to writing this review, I read with great interest the raging (and ranging) debate over the merit of the extraordinarily talented Robin McKinley's &quot;Deerskin.&quot;  And, as others have mentioned before me,  the difficulty seems to lie primarily in how the reviewer approaches the  novel: as a piece of literature or as a fictionalised chronical of a rape  victim's return to the world.  As I am, thank God, emininently unable to  comment on the verisimilitude of the latter, I shall confine myself to the  former, namely &quot;Deerskin's&quot; literary merit - and pray that those  who read my review judge it likewise as a poor attempt to sum up *writing*  and not *experience.*<br />Drawing primarily from Perrault's  &quot;Donkeyskin,&quot; and thereby also from Grimms'  &quot;Thousandfurs,&quot; McKinley delves into the story of the young,  neglected princess, Lissla Lissar, as she grows to womanhood.  Her mother,  the most beautiful woman in the seven kingdoms, has passed away - but not  before extracting from Lissar's father, the king, a promise that he would  not marry anyone less beautiful than herself.  And who could ever compare  to such beauty than her daughter, Lissar.  The King, in his madness,  declares that he shall wed his own flesh, and, when she (passively)  refuses, he rapes her.<br />This ultimate act of degradation sends Lissar out  with her trusty dog Ash (a present from none other than Prince Ossin) to  the wilderness to escape her father.  She suffers memory loss and  miscarriage (obliquely mentioned), and then is healed of her physical  wounds by &quot;The Lady,&quot; presumably a goddess *long-suffering sigh*.   This prompts her to journey to Prince Ossin's lands where a  quasi-Cinderella story takes place, with the common interest between the  two royalty being fleethounds.  Then comes a ball, a proposal, and a  fleeing (this time taking the glass slipper, aka six puppies, WITH her),  some sort of wandering wherein Lissar acts rather goddess-y herself, and a  final, unsatisfactory and strangely described confrontation between the  princess and her father.<br />In its generalities, &quot;Deerskin&quot; is a  fair retelling of the original fairy tales.  The language is good, if  sometimes confusing; the worldbuilding adequate; the characters oddly often  faceless.  McKinley seems to be attempting to translate some of the  original plot elements (such as the three dresses the Princess demands from  her father in the beginning) into more plausible realities (i.e., the  dresses appear as gifts from Ossin's mother), especially in her  introduction of the dogs as the binding element between a Prince and a girl  who has lost her memory.  <br />However, as admirable as this effort is, it  falls flat.  The fleethounds become *too* central, detracting from  character development.  Rather than demanding dresses like the sun, moon  and stars, and then a cloak of deer/donkey/thousandfurs-skin, Lissar skulks  around her room as though waiting to be raped, and McKinley introduces the  confusing and slightly off-putting deus-ex-machina of &quot;The Lady&quot;  aka &quot;Moonwoman,&quot; which she attempts to bind up in Lissar's very  existance.  <br />The final confrontation with Lissar's father is a stroke of  genius, and sadly lacking in either of the original fairy tales (which  always felt like two stories smooshed into one).  However, the *execution*  of this plot twist comes off badly as McKinley attempts to bring together  all the *thought* elements (Moonwoman, effects of rape, mother-oppression,  burgeoning love) into one dream-like sequence.<br />The reading moves along  very well when McKinley sticks to the basics of the originals - the time in  Lissar's father's court is particularly compelling, and the time spent with  Ossin not bad - but the middle and penultimate segments when Lissar wanders  off to lick her wounds are tedious to read, although they may be an honest  record of a broken mind piecingitself together.<br />Ultimately,  &quot;Deerskin&quot; is am abitious and partially successful retelling of a  particularly &quot;touchy&quot; fairy tales, and McKinley does an admirable  but not quite excellent job with it.  Fans of McKinley's other works might  be disappointed by the intermediary parts of this book; those considering  reading McKinley for the first time would do better to invest in her other  works first.	2000-05-25

If that was their purpose, then I  applaud them.  But as pieces of literature, they are dull, undeveloped,  cliche, and inconclusive.<br />The usual S&amp;S elements are evident in  &quot;Daughter of Witches&quot;: a tyrannical monotheistic church which  actually worships a demonic power (*long-suffering sigh insert here*), a  girl with untapped magical abilities, a mercenary - both male and female, a  mage (female), a streetrat-thief (boy), and several conveniently expendable  temple guards under the control of a lustful, manipulative, tyrannical  meglomaniacal highpriest (male - *insert second long-suffering  sigh*).<br />Ranira's plight is not compelling, mainly because her final  decision - to develop her latent magical talent - is painfully obvious from  the first.  Their flight from the city, while tense at times (the river bit  worked fairly well), counteracts the semi-interesting world-building  conflict Wrede had begun within the city by removing the threat of a return  to the city with every pageturn.<br />In short, &quot;Daughter of  Witches&quot; from the title to the last sentence, is predictable.<br />Those  who first discovered Wrede with her later novels would be well-served not  to invest in her earlier S&amp;S fare, but keep an eye out for upcoming  novels from this otherwise excellent author.	2000-05-10

McKillip is a master of such a speech,  thoroughly evidenced through her novel, &quot;Winter Rose.&quot;<br />The  story is a common one at heart: a coming-of-age story with romance at its  core and a generational mystery beneath that.  The plot moves quickly and  beautifully along, although Rois' frequent stops to press the elderly for  stories pertaining to the mysterious curse at times seem a tad too  convenient - but regardless, the book is one that enchants the  reader...firmly to his seat.<br />Indeed, &quot;Winter Rose&quot; is so well  written, with characters that say so much, though many do nothing  extraordinary, that the sheer pleasure of reading it overwhelms the rather  unsatisfactory ending (what is it about modern fantastist that they must  make love stories ambiguous at their close?), and earns it a more than  hearty recommendation for those who long to catch at wonder.	2000-05-08

However, &quot;A Knot in the Grain,&quot; although  good to read, like eating thick honey for a week, lacked in subtle  substinence.<br />&quot;The Healer,&quot; the story of a mute girl who finds  love in a telepathic ex-mage, began in a promising manner - using phrases  like, &quot;the creaky place that might once have been his heart,&quot; and  so on - but ends strangely, with them returning to the village and some  sense that a deeper meaning was intended but not, at least by me,  realised.<br />&quot;The Stagman,&quot; as others have noticed before me, was  particularly head-scratch-worthy, dealing with a cruel Regent-uncle, the  girl who should be Queen and does not know how, a prince who likes to hunt,  and the elusive stagman who, apparently, the Queen leaves her kingdom,  husband and four children for...what?  Why?  HOW?<br />&quot;Touk's  House&quot; can be seen as an interesting 'take' on the Rapunzel legend,  but ends with the message that kings are rotten and trolls (TROLLS! ) are  lovable.  Again, the ending is confusing, since the images cast upon us  feel as though they ought to be wrought with great  significance.<br />&quot;Buttercups&quot; is perhaps the best story,  structurally, following the wedding of a farmer to a girl twenty years his  junior, and their marital struggles.<br />The last story, from which the title  of the book takes its name, is not quite as bad as the previous reviews had  led me to believe.  The story is a snippet of a modern girl's life, dealing  not so much with the knot as with a magical wishing box she finds.   However, it's only a snippet of her life and leaves several threads  dangling.<br />All in all, fans of McKinley will probably want to buy this  book if only for her voice and not as much for her pat plots.  &quot;A Knot  in the Grain&quot; is nota poor book, it merely isn't her best.	2000-05-08

In their retellings of mainly Grimms' and Anderson's stories (including three that deal with Jack  and the Beanstalk, two with Rumplestilskin, and most with cutesy  cross-references all over the place - I'd no idea so many people had  difficulties with the Hansel and Gretel tale!), about a third are really  well done, a third are written well but with dangerous or offensive  content, and a few are just paltry.<br />The best story in the collection is  the story about Rapunzel, wherein the author (sorry, don't have the book on  hand!) deals precisely with the question of the ramifications of retelling  fairy tales. His conclusion is unsatisfactory - since he         seems to  long to marry the secular answer with the one written on his heart  (basically he says something along the lines of forget the  authorities/authors, and just live your life/believe in yourself/choose  your destiny, etc. - *sigh*), but his execution is interesting. &quot;Jack  and the Castle,&quot; the second of the Jack and the Beanstalk retellings  (the editor really could have used a course on fairy tale delegation) is  also very good, with a satisfactory ending, and good morals - certainly  loads better than either of the other two retellings of that tale which  both took place in a courtroom. &quot;One Fairy Tale: Hard Boiled&quot; is  the search for Rumplestilskin's name from the point of view of a private  eye - a fun read, even if he drags in Hansel and Gretel, like several  others do. <br />However, these are only three stories - there are many,  including retellings of Prince Charming's many loves (well told, but too  many sexual jokes), the Snow White story, the Big Bad Wolf's story, the  Steadfast Tin Soldier's story which include animalistic and sometimes  bestial sexuality and violence. <br />Overall, there are no stories so utterly  compelling that one must buy theanthology just to read it, and the  mediocre and horrid tales more than overwhelm those few which are  half-intriguing.<br />Those who *must* read a retelling of a Fairy Tale would  do well to take a look at Robin McKinley's stories, with another glance for  older readers to Donna Jo Napoli's books.  Or, if all else fails, write  your own!	2000-05-05

The result was inevitable: I read the story - and fell in  love.<br />Needless to say, I was *thrilled* when the World Fantasy Convention  felt the need to distribute free copies of the novel, complete with a  terribly interesting introduction from the author himself.  However, there  were things to do and places to be, and ultimately I was required to wait  until my father had finished pouring over it to read the thing  myself.<br />The wait was worth it.  Card has beautifully transferred and  expanded his short story to novel form - a difficult feat at best.  He uses  the length well: delving into Ender's home-life, detailing his first games,  playing with threads of philosophy, and keeping the reader absolutely glued  to his seat - even if he already knows the story from reading the  original.<br />Oh, sure, there are a few objections: Mazur's role is  humanised, softened, resulting in a slight loosening of the ending  tensions.  And it would have been nice if Card had lingered just a smidgen  longer on the brother' and sister's plot.  And - the largest objection of  all - the last chapter's introduction of the odd quasi-religion Ender  adopts as the newfound &quot;Speaker of the Dead&quot; is poorly realised,  tacked on, and reeks of its sequel.  (And a word of warning to parents: the  book does deal with some adult issues, and includes a fair amount of  violence.)  <br />But even these objections cannot completely override a  hearty recommendation of Card's classic &quot;Ender's Game.&quot;  Whether  you're a lover of science fiction, fantasy (yes, fantasy - he world-builds  like nothing else), mystery, adventure, or just a fan of good plot in  general -you could do no better than to make &quot;Ender's Game&quot; the  next novel on your bedtable.	2000-05-03

From &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to  &quot;Dragonheart,&quot; O'Brien traces literature (and film) from its  excellent Christian viewpoint to the neo-pagan inverse of morality.  He  also includes words of encouragement and means of discernment for the  concerned parent, as well as many pages of recommended reading in the  appendices.<br />However, O'Brien falls short in two major areas.  First, he  attempts to absolutely equate theology with literature, which is a false  and forced conclusion.  Secondly, he spreads his argument too far and thus  too thin - and leaves several gaps in his rationale, which make his  critique a lesser force against the societal dragon.<br />To begin with the  first: O'Brien tends to lean, at least in this book and on this subject,  more towards the ultra-conservative point of view, seeing all literature as  basically black or white, evil or angelic.  If the morals are bad then the  literature is as well.  However, this does not take into account the  hundreds of completely a- and immoral books written supurbly next to the  hundreds of excellently moral books written excruciatingly.  He makes no  allowances for literary merit apart from moral quality.<br />Likewise,  although he is justified in fearing and condeming magic in practice, he  makes two distinctions between the use of &quot;magic&quot; in Fantastic  Fiction - either miraculous or demonic.  He makes no allowances, nor does  he touch on &quot;magic&quot; which is inherent (&quot;indifferent  magic&quot; as it were), such as the &quot;magical&quot; element of  fairies, or singing swords, or eternal trees.<br />His argumentation, too, was  too widely dispersed.  He did not limit himself to solely tracing the use  of the dragon image through literature, but looked at several different  images through at least two mediums, with several tangental lines into  child-rearing, the state of society, and discernment of spirits.  While all  of these are good topics to speak of, and are handled fairly competently in  the book, they have little to do with his thesis and weaken the  argument.<br />Because of the broader nature of his argument, several  important works are not mentioned at all.  The most notible gap lies in his  critique of Disney films, wherein he completely ignores Disney's most  blatantly &quot;new age&quot; film, &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  His  critique of &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; also left much to be  desired, since from his comments it appeared that he had not read the  original work.<br />This is not to say that &quot;A Landscape with  Dragons&quot; is a failure - quite the contrary.  Merely, I should have  liked to have seen it a bit more thought out, a bit more tightened up, a  bit more focused.  As an means of encouragement and support to parents who  rightly mistrust the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, this is an excellent  primer.  But for those who have been reading in the genre and fighting for  God's place back into this realm, his conclusions are often too hasty.  Be  that as it may, it is my ardent wish that &quot;A Landscape with  Dragons&quot; may bring people to the Lord and spare a generation of  children from the wrath of the dragon.	2000-04-26

However, undertake it the  accomplished Andre Norton and Rosemary Edgehill (a.k.a. eluki bes shahar)  do.<br />The set-up is exciting.  Rather than drawing rooms we have the White  Tower (a secret intelligence agency), rather than Mr. Darcy, we have the  Duke of Wessex, and his Lizzy is none other than the cross-dimensional  Sarah Cunningham/Marchioness of Roxbury.  Lady Jersey, Napoleon and even  the Swedish nobility are scheduled to make an appearance in this  international escapade.<br />So why then the two stars?<br />The answer lies  primarily in characterisation.  Our heros, the displaced Marchioness of  Roxbury and the incorrigable Duke of Wessex dislike each other and - as we  are told more than once too often - are very much engaged, and half way  through, very much married.  No spark of interest passes between them,  although given their personalities we might have had a rather nice Pride  and Prejudice romance with a twist of mystery thrown in - but the authors  keep our heros in a state of intense personal indifference (not even hate),  which makes the reader indifferent to their fate, whether separate or  apart.  The secondary characters are a tad more interesting, but,  lamentably, secondary.  The ending twist where Wessex suddenly  will-not-lose-his-lady-love-despite-what-dangers-may-come is therefore  wretchedly weak, especially next to the charming romance of the turncoat's  neice and the missing Dauphin.<br />The plot, as shown through the language,  also left much to be desired.  The authoresses attempted to combine too  many things at once, and ended up with a mismash of frayed threads.   Because, for some inexplicable reason, someone thought it better to bring  in a heroine from another world and then give her amnesia, there are  interminable and reiterated passages where Sarah attempts to convince  herself that she is the Marchioness.  (One can only read, &quot;I am  Roxbury&quot; so many times!)  The same is true for the betrothal - at  least five   or six people say, &quot;You/I/We are betrothed,&quot; to  which is almost always replied, &quot;For nine years.&quot;  OK - I get it  already.  The alternate history element also tripped up the movement of the  plot and the language used to express it.  Nearly once a chapter the  authoresses stopped to explain a bit of history.  While this is perhaps  considerate, it also slows down the narrative, usually has little bearing  on the plot, and is tediously written.  Those who read alternate histories  do so at their own risk of not understanding every nuance.  That's half the  game.  Other plot threads are picked up and never used again, such as the  necklace Wessex gives Roxbury.  On the other hand, some plot threads are  excruciatingly apparent, such as who the Dauphin is, when they are meant to  be a surprise.<br />However, with all that said, I still recommend the book to  those who like to read alternate histories, and/or adventurous Regencies.   A note of warning to those with religious sensibilities - the warring  factions of the time are more than brought in to play, with the added  element of the &quot;old religion&quot; which is never fully explained nor  realised.<br />As for myself, if I decide to read on in the continuing  adventures of the poorly sketched Wessexes, I shall certainly first borrow  the book from the library.	2000-04-26

Very few books combine grace, thought, and metaphor so beautifully as Peter Beagle's classic novel, &quot;The Last Unicorn.&quot;  His use of language is supurb, his plot line delicate and deep, his characterization  poignant and humorous all at once.  Certainly, one should class &quot;The  Last Unicorn&quot; among those works, such as &quot;The Prophet,&quot; that  brush spirituality and show the merest achingly beautiful glimpse of the  shrouded divine.  <br />While rereading this tale, laughing over remembered  lines and shuddering at the phantastical scenes, I was frequently caught up  with surprise at his light strokes of humanity - the reactions to lovliness  personified in the Unicorn, the question of reality and legend, the true  nature of joy and suffering - which I had missed when I had read the  &quot;pretty tale&quot; years ago as a child.<br />Is it too euphorically  hyperbolic to declare that &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; can only be  appreciated by those who long for the beauty, purity and grace the unicorn  represents to be once more present in the world?  Is it too ridiculous to  declare that those who wallow in the dreariness of the seeming day-to-day  may not appreciate this novel, while those who have read this book, and the  &quot;Chronicals of Narnia,&quot; and all those tales that proclaim the  True the Good and the Beautiful as more real than what we see about us will  marvel at Beagle's tale?<br />I hope not - for I should like to think that the  divine spark Beagle has given us in &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; is as  vital to those who prefer Hemmingway as to those who dwell with hobbits.	2000-03-20

I wasn't quite sure whatto expect - certainly this would be no Tom Jones, but it wouldn't be Austen either - however what I found was a pleasant epistolary jaunt through a young girl's first season out.  A jaunt, which, although begun a week late was quickly finished two weeks early!  Customary to 18th century novels, Evelina's history is somewhat romantic, both her guardian and the hero impossibly good (a refreshing novelty, if a little sappy in places.  They were apparently active members in the Mutual Admiration Society), and the secondary characters ridiculously vulgar.  As Burney's first novel, the work shows some awkwardness in construction, but is otherwise excellent.  Readers of modern romances may find the heros a bit formal, and fans of Jane Austen may find the epistlotary form unbelievable, but both they and lovers of historical fiction would do well to invest in this book, which provides an excellent glance into the end of an era, and one charming heroine's attempt to muddle through it.

What?  Another novel?  Ah - such felicity!  I was truly excited.<br />However, as soon as I opened the book, I was likewise  baffled.<br />Jane Austen is perhaps best known for her parlour novels - those  stories which take place within the polite confines of country society,  with brief forays into the questionable confines of London or Bath.   However, Sanditon takes place in a fictional sea-side resort - a truly  unique choice, if rather difficult to imagine without Bertie Wooster  bumbling along somewhere in the background.<br />This bewilderment is quickly  overthrown by Austen's inimitable style which sets out the main characters  within the first eleven chapters: Charlotte, our strangely silent heroine,  the entrepreneurial Parkers and their hypochondriac siblings, Mr Sidney  Parker the love interest, and the usual cast of Grande Dames, silly girls,  sickly girls, ambitious girls and Sir Edward - a man who considers himself  &quot;dangerous, in line with Lovelace.&quot;  With such an hilarious cast  at such an unusual place, one only wonders whither Austen meant for  subplots to go (for we know that the whole will end with the marriage of  Charlotte and Sidney).<br />Anne Telscombe, humbly credited as &quot;Another  Lady&quot; attempts to answer that question, and does so fairly well.  She  has her moments of sparkling Austenesque writing - such as her description  of the husband-hunting sisters gracing every part of the seaside with their  figures in hopes of catching an eligable bachelor's eye, or Miss Parker so  ridiculously worried over the pie - but has many more moments of  pseudo-Austen.  Elements of pop-psychology are evident, research on the  times are clumsily inserted (the interminable seaweed debacle comes to  mind) and sometimes ignored (who may dance with/give presents to whom,  etc.), and the resulting characterisations either too flat or too  &quot;modern.&quot;<br />However, Ms Telscombe has my complete admiration for  attempting such a difficult task as finishing this novel to the  satisfaction of ANY Austen fanatic.  She has done a very good and  entertaining job of it, making Sanditon a worthy read for anyone pining for  a new Austen novel.	2000-02-14
US	50687973	RWEZVIXUVLLYA	031285689X	864267529	A College of Magics	Books	3	42	48	N	N	Original yet Odd	Having just read the delightful but incredibly difficult to find &quot;Sorcery and Cecelia,&quot; which Caroline Stevermer co-wrote with Patricia Wrede (&quot;Mairelon the Magician;&quot; &quot;Magician's  Ward&quot;), I was eager to read more by this author.  Imagine my joy,  then, when I learnt that Ms. Stevermer had written another book in the  fascinating sub-genre of Historical Fantasy.  <br />While &quot;Sorcery and  Cecelia&quot; is set in 1817 Regency England, &quot;A College of  Magics&quot; catapults us a hundred years further, to approximately 1908 in  Edwardian Europe.  The story follows Faris, the young Dutchess of Galazon  (which, one presumes, is supposed to be located somewhere east of Austria  and west of Romania) as she spends three years at Greenlaw University  before returning to reclaim her place in politics.  The catch?  She's just  found out that she's the Warden of the North - and that she must mend the  rift her grandmother made in the fabric of this reality.<br />Ms. Stevermer  writes in a language much akin to the literature of the time (cf. E. M.  Forster, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, etc.) - complete with random moments  of insight, liberally strewn metaphysical poetry, snips and snatches of  song and culture, and occasional forays into the world of subconscious or  &quot;sensation&quot; writing.  However, perhaps because of this attention  to the time period, perhaps for some other reason, the story suffers  several major flaws:<br />The plot is rather dreamlike and...strange.  Often  new plot lines will be introduced without explanation or reason - and then  just as quickly dropped.  The Wardens of the World are explained only in  their existence but never fully in their capacity.  Characters are  introduced, given a place of prominence, and dropped after a few chapters.   Places are never given an exact location except by general reference (with  the exception of their time in Paris).  And the ending debacle is so  surrealistic that one can hardly make hide nor hair of how Faris ascended  the stair, or how she closed the rift, or very much of anything.  The  closing is also unsatisfactory, with no &quot;happily ever after&quot; but  a sort of vague continuing that feels as though it ought to be  significant.<br />Again, one must commend Ms. Stevermer in her ability to so  replicate the disjointedness of Eduardian literature - the attempt to show  life as it is and not as it ought to be - however the result is a strangely  concocted novel that never quite comes together as a whole.<br />Those  interested in Eduardian Literature, or Historical Fantasy will find &quot;A  College of Magics&quot; interesting.  Those searching for an encore to  &quot;Sorcery and Cecelia&quot; would do better investing in Patricia  Wrede's Regency Fantasies.	2000-01-24

The story also follows the Vardrul descendant of  Lady Verran and Terrs fal Ghrizni's son, who in &quot;The Sorcerer's  Heir&quot; had managed to transform himself into a convincing semblance of  a Vardrul.  Their mission: to arrest the fal Ghrizni's dying &quot;Curse of  Darkness&quot; which is spreading over the continent and suffocating the  humanoid inhabitants.  The plot, while inclusive of the major plot elements  of the first two novels, unfortunately revolves around a quest - a plot  form in which Ms. Volsky does not excel (see &quot;The Curse of the  Witch-Queen&quot; for an example of her initial quasi-quest literature).   While the quest does allow Ms. Volsky to make mention of the Turos, the  Strellians, and the Szarians - cast members from her previous novels - it  also acts as an all-too-obvious ploy to wrap up the two-fronted thread from  her other novels.  No theme is greatly explored (until the question of  kinship is flittingly mentioned at the end), no relationships forged, no  link beyond plot made between this and the other two books.  The pace does  go quickly, which is a blessing, but otherwise the book lacks complexity.   Those who want to know how the curse is thwarted and/or those who must own  every book Ms. Volsky has written would do well to invest in &quot;The  Sorcerer's Curse.&quot;  However, as has been mentioned before, &quot;The  Sorcerer's Lady&quot; stands very well by itself - a brief epilogue would  have been all that was required to tell whether fal Ghrizni's curse was  ever effected.	2000-01-17

Alas, &quot;The Sorcerer's Heir&quot; falls into this all-too-common mode.  Continuing the story primarily  through the eyes of Lady Verran fal Ghrizni, we are suffocated in the world  of the utterly alien Vardruls upon whom the Duke of Lanthi Ume makes war  bordering on genocide.  Ms. Volsky is to be commended for her ability to  create a race that is its own civilisation and not just humans with pointed  ears - but the Vardruls are so convincingly foreign (an effect heightened  by the narrator's horrified point of view) that reading about their  civilisation for an entire novel is rather difficult.  Like Verran, one  longs for a breath of the sewer-canals of Lanthi Ume over the  &quot;harmonious&quot; caverns.  Some levity is added by the introduction  of two bravos and their ineffectual attempts to off the odious Duke, and  the explorer who woos Verran is a charming character, but this is balanced  by the Duke's Amazonian-betrothed, who is rather flat-charactered.  Some  interesting questions are tentatively explored concerning humanity's  propensity towards the violent, but are never satisfactorally concluded.   Perhaps that is the main quibble with &quot;The Sorcerer's Heir&quot; - too  much is unresolved by characters who do not significantly change.  Die-hard  fans of Paula Volsky will want to invest in every book of this trilogy, but  for those seeking a good novel, keep to &quot;The Sorcerer's Lady&quot;  which easily stands alone.	2000-01-17

Rarely do collaborative efforts seem to work, but  &quot;Sorcery and Cecelia&quot; most assuredly does!  Following the  adventures of two cousins - the inept Kate in her first season in London,  and the headstrong Cecelia as she discovers her sorcerous abilities - the  reader is swept into a world of danger, mystery and intrigue (and the never  fully explained story of WHAT in the world that adventure with the goat was  about) that makes the pages turn of their own accord!  The historical  research is solid, the content wholesome and exciting, and the romances  (Kate's especially) to sigh for.  In short, as the others have said before  me, this is *fun*.<br />Unfortunately, good novels seems to be out of vogue  today, and you'll have an either difficult or exorbitant time buying it.

That, madam, is what I wish you to say.&quot;  &quot;<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />&quot;Northanger Abbey,&quot; the  first, shortest, most satiric, and least read of Jane Austen's completed  novels, is a delightful treasure that will make you quite literally laugh  out loud (so beware bringing the book to the airport, as I did, lest you  suffer strange glances for your smothered sniggers).  Following the journey  of the coming-of-age Catherine Morland and her misadventures in Bath to the  &quot;horrid&quot; Abbey, Jane Austen presents us with perhaps her funniest  sociological book, that proves not only that teens will be teens in any  age, but that an overactive imagination is not always a blessing, and that  love is often the result of being loved.  Readers should keep on the  lookout for the commentaries on novels, feminine wiles and homecomings from  Austen herself - a technique subdued in her other novels.  The cast also  includes Jane Austen's wittiest hero, Henry Tilney (a.k.a. &quot;Da  Man&quot;), as well as a female foil more duplicitous than &quot;Sense and  Sensibility's&quot; Lucy Steele.  The Signet Classic edition boasts a good  introduction by Margaret Drabble, perhaps better read after the text as a  commentary.  Best viewed as a comedic parody, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;  is a pleasure to read, whether you are a long-standing member of the JASNA,  or just dipping into the boisterous literature of the Regency.<br />Felicitous  reading! Yours, &amp;c.,	1999-12-09

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; can certainly be taken as little else than a charming and amusing Eduardian love story.  But to do so is to belittle the true grace and beauty of this stunning piece of  literature.  Like so many of Forster's works (indeed, like so many of his  contemporaries), &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is about grappling with the  infinite in a world so seemingly, &quot;flat, stale and unprofitable.&quot;  Through the medium of a story, Forster brings to light the heroine's own  internal struggle from childishness, to mindless conformity (&quot;the  ranks of the benighted&quot;), to a sort of &quot;awakening.&quot;  In  short, Lucy Honeychurch's own journey is parallel to the historical changes  in mindset that have formed our  modern restless society.  The book is rife  with meaning and symbol, found in action as well as chapter titles.  The  language is beautiful, the characters charmingly (and sometimes  sardonically) drawn, and the sense of place outstanding.  &quot;A Room with  a View&quot; is an excellent starting place for those interested in reading  the works of Forster, both because of its brevity and also because of its  historical youthfulness (his first novel).  Although I felt the ending  lacked in explanatory action, and I was not wholly satisfied with its  philosophical conclusion, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is doubtless an  excellent piece of literature that works on several levels.  Lovers and  scholars of the various liberal arts would do very well to read this, as  well as lovers of Eduardian and modern British novels.	1999-12-09

What I discovered was exactly the  opposite.<br />&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is long, poorly written, poorly  characterized, agenda-ridden, historically and mythically inaccurate and -  worst of all - dull.  I found the characters completely unsympathetic, the  sex scenes gruesome and drawn-out, the perspective offensive (i.e.,  violently anti-Christian, a strange perspective for one who claimed Christ  on her webpage), and the prose plodding.  <br />As for the feminist aspect, if  &quot;feminism&quot; means the maligning of the opposite sex and the  desecration of erroniously titled &quot;patriarchial religions&quot; - then  this is an excellent example of feminist literature.  If, however, feminism  implies the female's perspective, then Ms. Bradley completely missed the  mark with her unsympathetic, libido or emotionally driven women who  themselves do not understand the fullness, richness and awesome domestic  power of the fair sex.<br />The only impetus to finish the book was that I  tore a corner of the unweildy thing and felt so badly (it was borrowed from  a friend) that I bought another copy for the owner, and now owned a copy  myself.  The lure of consumerism snared me, and I finished the darn thing -  after many, many months.<br />However, despite such a moribund review, I will  give &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; two stars: the first for effort (one can  only imagine the work that went into producing such a tome), and the second  for the revenue it produced which funded Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy  Magazine.  Ms. Bradley, may God rest her soul, was an excellent editor and  mentor.  But as an authoress, she lacked.	1999-12-02

She manages to mix politics, intrigue, horror, suspense, romance, history and fantasy together to form gripping novels.  In &quot;The Curse of the Witch-Queen,&quot; (Ms.  Volsky's first book) we see the beginnings of her inimitable style: the  court of Szar, the Sorcerer King, the slatkum (an alien creature), the  whispering portraits.  However, her voice is by no means complete by this  time.  &quot;The Curse of the Witch-Queen&quot; is &quot;cursed&quot; by a  split plot, a &quot;quest&quot;, expedient characters, and unsteady  linguistics.  Long-time devotees of Ms. Volsky's work will doubtless find  great pleasure reading her first novel, with its hints of Illusion's  Sentients and even The Wolf of Winter's necromancy, but those first reading  Ms. Volsky's work would do better to seek out her recent novels,  particularly Illusion.	1999-11-30

The characters are the &quot;scions&quot; of the  previous two novels - and rather whiney characters at that.  They spend  their time lost in a jungle, afraid.  The reader spends his or her time  lost in the doldrums, bored.  If one is an illustration flipper, like me,  who tends to look at all the pictures before reading the plot, the  &quot;magic eating creatures&quot; are already revealed.  There are very  few books that I cannot finish - this nearly became one of those (except  that I had purchased it, I certainly would not have finished).  If you  enjoyed her Valdemar series thus far, if you read that series merely to  puzzle out her world, then consider your puzzle complete and leave  &quot;The Silver Gryphon&quot; on the shelves.	1999-11-30

Sera, Eliste and Jed have  gone to New Imbria to escape the Duchess, little realising that another  adventure has just begun.  Incorporating some dangling threads (that due to  her tight writing did not seem to dangle) from its predecessor, &quot;The  Gnome's Engine&quot; takes the reader through several separate plots: the  Duchess' revenge, the slave trade in Orania, the mystery of the hobgoblins,  and of course the mystery of the engine itself.  The tone of the work  varies slightly from &quot;Goblin Moon&quot; in its freshness, apropos to  the freshness of New Imbria (the Americas).  Readers will be glad to see  the dashing cavalier Lord Francis Love Skelbrooke in full flair as well -  and may even learn the true colour of his hair!  All in all an excellent  sequel from an excellent author.	1999-11-30
US	50687973	R2QNUPJX28L21M	0441294278	436986687	Goblin Moon	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Fantasy and the Age of Reason - Completely Compatible	Theresa Edgerton, I will state right now, is one of my absolutely favourite fantasy authors in the genre today.  Within the space of a few hundred pages, she transports us to a world both foreign and familiar,  introduces a cast Dickens would envy, and completes a novel that *might*  relinquish the reader's attention given the space of a month.  While  publishers are constantly &quot;upping&quot; the cost and the length (and  the dullness) of their new lines, Theresa Edgerton is an excellent foil -  slashing through the cliche bilge and shining through the benighted press.   Her stories have the added quality of &quot;rereadableness&quot; - for they  rest on limited omniscience rather than surprise.<br />In &quot;Goblin  Moon,&quot; the first book in a duology, Ms. Edgerton creates a world based  on eighteenth century Europe, replete with evil duchesses and dashing  masqueraders, husband-catchers and Faust mirrors, Guilds of gnomes and  dwarves and covens of goblins.  Although readers of her other series (The  Green Lion Trilogy, and its sister Trilogy - both set in a para-Celtic  land) might find the abrupt change in world surprising, yet the first few  chapters will certainly convince them to continue reading.  Students of  this particular era (who suffered through Locke and have been looking for a  means of putting such non-knowledge to use) will find her world-building  especially delightful, from the Fates to the sheep-drawn  carriages.<br />Beware, though.  Ms. Edgerton's novels are notoriously  difficult to find, but more than worth the agony of waiting.	1999-11-29

This book is a  wake-up call to the sleeping masses.  It *must* be polemic in nature,  because it *is* a war-cry.  Through several chapters, Kreeft lays out the  battlelines - good and evil, to be precise - as well as Christ's plan for  triumph: Ecuminism.  The message is as clear as it should be obvious: this  is not the time to bicker amongst ourselves, but to fight the common enemy  of evil.  &quot;Ecumential Jihad&quot; is a book of bleak realism and  divine hope.  We have met the enemy, but he needn't be us.	1999-11-29
US	50687973	R2F3ZYBWDVORMY	0441775330	885610016	The Sorcerer's Lady	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A Must for Paula Volsky Fans	&quot;The Sorcerer's Lady&quot; takes us to the suspiciously Venetian world of Lanthi Ume, where decadance and intrigue are the daily fare.  Ms. Volsky beautifully mingles her usual blend of high society, politics,  terror and fantasy together in this first book of her only trilogy thus  far.  The interest of &quot;The Sorcerer's Lady&quot; is compounded by Ms.  Volsky's decision to place the main characters in a marriage at the outset  - rather than the standard romance which leads *to* that happy state.  For  those who loved the richness of Illusion, (and want one more reference to  the elusive Strell) this is the book for you.	1999-11-29
