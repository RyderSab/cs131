When I first picked up this book, I figured I was stepping into the stylized and trendy world of the Tony Robbins' of the universe.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Its short narrative makes it easy to decide on.  Even a slow reader like myself finished it in 90 minute.   <br /> <br />\\"Who Moved my Cheese?\\" excels because it does not force a litany of business ideas on the reader.  Instead, it takes a simple story and uses to illustrate a much bigger point; not only about business, but human nature as well.  At its core, \\"...Cheese?\\" addresses the natural human aversion to change.  Using the arena of a mouse maze, it uses 4 characters (two mice named Sniff and Scurry and two miniature humans named Hem and Haw) to illustrate different people's reactions to change.  All four characters are used to finding food, cheese in this case, at the same spot in the maze each day.  Soon, the cheese begins to be less in quantity and eventually goes away entirely.  The cheese has obviously been moved and it creates a change that they must confront.  The more instinctive, primal minds of Sniff and Scurry react one way to the situation, and the more analytical, complex human minds of Hem and Haw react another way.   The key to this tale is how different their responses are.   It shows how people can become so comfortable and complacent with a situation that they are unwilling to move even when the circumstances that made them comfortable have changed.   <br /> <br />I, like many people who read this book, saw myself in these characters (as well as other people I know).  I have been afraid of change and of taking the necessary steps to deal with it, just as many other people have been.  I won't say that read this book was a life-changing experience, but it definitely gave me ideas to chew on and that stayed in the front of my mind for days afterwards.  Keeping the story in mind allowed me to embrace change and move forward at a time when I was just standing still and wondering, \\"who moved my cheese?\\"	2004-11-28

It would be safe to say he loathes Ken Starr, perhaps even outright hates Ken Starr.  One thing's for certain, Ken Starr's relentless, and often irrelevant, witch-hunt against President Bill Clinton did nothing to improve Carville's opinion of Ken Starr.  President Clinton was not only James Carville's boss, (Carville being an expert political analyst) he was (and still is) a good friend.  President Clinton was also supposed to only be being investigated by Ken Starr for some supposedly shady business maneuvers with the Whitewater real estate deal that at its simplest was a bad deal that lost some people a lot of money.  However, time and evidence proved that nothing illegal occurred.  Yet, the Republican operatives, who were bitter at losing the Whitehouse to a southern upstart, couldn't accept that.  So, they applied pressure to Starr (a supposed `Independent' Counsel) to find something, anything, they could pin on Clinton.  Starr embraced the challenge with a near religious zeal and somehow managed expand his investigation to such a degree that an inquiry into a real estate deal somehow became a referendum on Clinton's sexual habits, particularly his affair with intern Monica Lewinksy.  This really pissed of James Carville (and that crude word is justified for how Carville felt).  Carville felt the need to address Starr's wild goose chase and \\"....And the Horse he Rode in On\\" is his response.  <br /> <br />Don't let Carville's vitriol, southern drawl, and bulldog mentality dissuade you.  He pulls back the curtain the wizard and reveals Starr to be the fraud that many think he is.  Carville addresses, point by point, all the supposed reasons that Starr is using for turning a real estate investigation into pornography that would make Larry Flynt proud.  Carville fiercely attacks Starr's tactics, his theories, his justifications, his `evidence', and punches a mack-truck size hole in middle of one of the biggest individual abuses of the justice system.  Opponents of Clinton aren't likely to find much to like in this book, but those who were angered by this whole ridiculous process will feel grateful to Carville for giving a voice to many of the emotions they had.  All that, plus a mouth-watering recipe for brisket, makes \\"...And the Horse he Rode in One\\" a valuable read.	2004-11-28

One would think that this little memoir, which owes its title to that famous play in the Super Bowl when Joe Gibbs went for it on fourth and one and John Riggins scored the winning touchdown, would provide a keen insight into the mind and life of football's coaching legends and one of the NFL's true good guys.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Fourth and One\\" turns out to be a fairly disappointing book.  Written during the latter portion of his first stint as the Redskins coach, \\"Fourth and One\\" is a poorly planned and poorly written book.  It seems as if Gibbs (and co-author Jerry Jenkins) just sat down and wrote the manuscript in just a matter of days.  Gibbs appears to be operating mostly from his own immediate personal memories of events and there seems to have been little research put into what really happened.  While the earlier days of Gibbs life and the beginnings of his family and career are events that one would need rely solely on memory for, when it comes to Gibbs coaching career and exploits, there's no excuse for not providing at least a minimum of research into things that are public record.  It's very disappointing when Gibbs is referring to particular moments in his coaching career and gets names of players and opponents wrong.  He gets the scores of the games wrong; he gets the dates (even the years!) of certain games wrong; and that doesn't even cover the situations where he gets the overall story wrong in his dealings with players.<br /><br />Another aspect of this book that is unfortunate is Gibbs constant need to invoke religion and his relationship with God as a cause or resource in every episode in his life.  While there is something to be said for the spiritual guidance that can lead one to success, Gibbs really seems to be trying to force his spirituality onto readers who would prefer to know more about other aspects in his life, especially the football-related ones.  It's not just the message that is off-putting, it's the manner in which it is delivered that disappoints, too.  It's a bit jarring to be in the middle of a passage of some event that Gibbs is describing and then have Gibbs force a `God's will' type sentence in the narrative.<br /><br />In addition to better research and planning, there need to be more of a focus to this book.  If Gibbs wanted to write about his spirituality and how it has helped him in life, then he should have geared the book that way.  As it is, it's trying to reach out to the football fans while also being heavy on the religious message.  There was a better way to go with this book, and it's a shame that Gibbs and his co-author didn't do that.to force his spirituality onto readers who would prefer to know more about other aspects in his life, especially the football-related ones.

Don't expect any Kitty Kelley-style revelations.  This is only unauthorized because it wasn't written in direct cooperation with the band and to attract buyers with enticing `unauthorized' label.  In truth, \\"Hey Ya!\\" is nothing more than a 190 page glowing review of OutKast.  None of this, however, is a knock against the book because, at its core, it's a fascinating look at the beginnings and evolution of one of the true landmark groups in music today.   <br /> <br />From their earliest days after meeting in high school, Andre Benjamin (Andre 3000) and Antwan Patton (Big Boi) set out to make music on their own terms, seeking to be evolutionary and revolutionary.  Whereas most hip hop acts were sticking to tired formulas and unoriginal beats and techniques, this duo (which quickly adopted the appropriately title name, OutKast) kept pushing the envelope and trying create something new.  This biography deconstructs the group by showing some of their earliest musical influences like, understandably, Run-DMC and George Clinton and the more unlikely Kate Bush (a personal favorite of Big Boi's).  It reveals how the two principles disparate styles didn't disrupt the music, but rather enhanced.  It gives a nod a to OutKast's earlier supports like Atlanta's Dungeon Family studios and the Organized Noise studios.  Most importantly, the author, Chris Nickson, spends most of his effort analyzing how OutKast evolved musically (and stylistically) with each progressive album.  Instead of resting on what worked before, OutKast kept taking risks and it made a difference in how they were viewed and in their legacy.   <br /> <br />While \\"Hey Ya!...\\" may not be a packed with amazing revelations, it still gives fans a good opportunity to get inside this seminal hip hop act.  The information is strong and gives fans a stronger connection with this OutKast. <br />	2004-10-07

In the entire breadth and length of world history, few events stir the imagination and possess one's profound interest like World War II.  It is probably because, had it not been a so tragic and so real of a war, it would have made for tremendous cinema.  Never in this world's history has so much been at stake in an armed conflict; and never has there been a war with so many highs and lows, with mind-boggling twists and more drama and tension than 1000 movies.  The early tragic days of war, like Germany's `blitzkrieg' (lightning war) assault on France were tempered by the minor miracles such as the dramatic Allied escape at Dunkirk.  The unstoppable force of Rommel's AfrikaCorps conquering of North Africa was soon offset by Britain's dramatic victory and El Alamein and General Patton's dogged quest to push Rommel right out of the African continent.  These two examples barely scratch the surface of stories in just the European Theater of World War II (Japan's Pacific War is a whole different set of drama and heroics).  <BR><BR>Noted historian, Cornelius Ryan, tackles one of the most ambitious, daring, and momentum-shifting operations of the entire war, the massive Allied invasion of France on June 6th, 1944:  D-Day!  It had been more than four years since the Germans viciously evicted the Allies from the European proper during the brutal conquering of France.  It had also been more than two years since the United States had gotten involved in the war.  Yet, despite the length of time and numerous operations (including the conquering of Fascist Italy), the Allies had yet to set foot back on Hitler's `Fortress Europe'.  Aside from a failed Canadian invasion attempt to Dieppe some time earlier, no attempt had been made to retake the land and open a second front against Nazi Germany.  Finally after months, of planning, the Allies were prepared for begin that `day of days' when the final step towards freeing the world from Hitler's tyranny would begin.<BR><BR>Ryan bringsand ingenious gift of storytelling in recounting the tales of the men who planned and the men who fought in this decisive battle.  Instead of attempting a dry, academic narrative, Ryan focuses on the personal battles of the men in the conflict.  He ranges from expressing Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower's apprehension and distress over green lighting the mission after having already postponed it once to the fear of the paratrooper who was forced to play dead while he hung from his parachute canopy off a church steeple while German bullets peppered the air around him to the hope of a French family as they realized what was happening and that one day their teenage daughter would end up marrying one of the liberators.  The account of how Hitler's advisors refused the believe that this was the true invasion and declined the wake their leader from his nap to get orders lest they feel the Fuhrer's wrath is also vividly depicted.  \\"The Longest Day\\" is full of rich stories like these.    <BR><BR>Ryan breaks his script down into three distinct sections:  The Wait (dealing with the preparation and first postponement of the invasion), the Night (dealing with the pre-invasion paratrooper mission to secure bridgeheads and neutralize German resistance to the coming land attack), and the Day (which deals the actually assault).  Unlike some historians, Ryan gives a fair and balanced of all the participants involved in D-Day.  While British Glider Troops captured crucial bridges that nullified the German counter-offensive potential, Ryan also gives due to the American airborne assaults by the 101st and 82nd airborne divisions.  While most of history recalls the bloody price paid by the American soldiers on the sands of `Bloody Omaha' Beach, Ryan does well focus recognition the dramatic obstacles and astounding accomplishments of the British forces at Gold and Sword Beaches and the Canadian contributions at Juno Beach.  <BR><BR>D-Day was the most dramatic military operationin terms of manpower, complexity, and risk ever attempted up to that point.  While the war would still drag on for almost a year following the success of this invasion, it was clear to many, including the illustrious Rommel, himself, that Germany's last best chance to end the war on favorable terms was over, and it was just a matter of time before the Third Reich was brutally wiped from the earth.  Thanks to Cornelius Ryan, all history buff and casual history readers have, in \\"The Longest Day\\", an historical document allows us to never to forget how these men, to quote Lincoln, \\"laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom\\".	2004-06-13

Alas, TR's star was so bright that, in history's eyes, it has flashed over the lives of those close to him, especially those of his children.  What is a shame is that little has been written about his namesake son, Theodore (Ted) Roosevelt, Jr.  Most of what is known about him comes from anecdotes gleaned from biographies of his famous father.  What was it like to live with the pressure of that famous name?  Fortunately, author H. Paul Jeffers has taken the separate scraps of knowledge about Ted Roosevelt and crafted a relatively absorbing biography of a man who, it can be argued, was the equal of a his father on many levels. <BR><BR>\\"In the Rough Rider's Shadow\\" is a very appropriate title because it describes how Ted Roosevelt had lived most of his life.  What Jeffers is able to reveal is a very accomplished man who bore the name Theodore Roosevelt as a mark of honor instead of a burden.  Ted's path in life was not dissimilar to his father's.  He attended Harvard, and while not the other-worldly student that his father was, still graduated with honors.  He served in the United States Army bravely in the Great War and with conspicuous gallantry in World War II (earning the Congressional Medal of Honor).  He was an admired family man who was a loving husband and caring father.  He even developed a love of outdoor expeditions that his father was so famous for.  The only real difference between the two men was that Ted didn't have the love of politics that TR did.  He served a few terms in the New York Assembly before an unsuccessful bid for the 1924 New York governorship.  After that, he was through running for elected office.  Instead, he did wonderful work in appointed positions such as Assistant Secretary of the Navy (once again emulating his father) and colonial governor in both Puerto Rico and the Phillipines.<BR><BR>Most of what is known about Ted Roosevelt comes from the movie \\"The Longest Day\\" where his bravery on Utah Beach (which earned him the Medal of Honor) during D-Day was portrayed by Henry Fonda.  Because the book is less than 300 pages, the reader is not able to develop a close connection with Ted the way one could with his father via such remarkable books at Edmund Morris' \\"Theodore Roosevelt\\" saga.  Still, thanks to Jeffers research and the assistance of a wonderful memoir by Ted's wife, Eleanor (not THAT Eleanor Roosevelt), we are able to get a little closer to a remarkable man.	2004-04-29

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Scathing, if not completely satisfying	The disappointing thing about Ron Suskind's book \\"The Price Loyalty\\", which chronicles ousted Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's stormy tenure in the Bush Administration, is that it doesn't provide a smoking gun that pulls back the curtain on all the misdeeds and duplicity of this current presidential administration.  That being said, it still may be a `hot knife', as it still shows a frightening look as the inner workings of Bush's top men.  It's frightening to read accounts of powerful and dangerous cabinet men (like Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft, and Don Rumsfeld) make power plays in front of a `leader' (using that term loosely) in George W. Bush who seems passive, indifferent, and perhaps even incompetent. <BR><BR> \\"Price of Loyalty\\", which Suskind compiled based on interviews with Paul O'Neill and documents provided by O'Neill is one part biography of O'Neill's term as the Treasury Secretary and one part revelation of the puppet regime of Bush.  It's a puppet regime in the sense that the puppet is the president and the puppet-masters are forceful people like the big three mentioned above.  The book chronicles the planning stages of the economic policy that O'Neill (in coordination with friend and Fed Chaiman, Alan Greenspan) wanted to effect to help stabilize a weak, and soon to be collapsing, economy.  It chronicles how the Bush Administration was minorly supportive at first, then indifferent, and then downright opposed to O'Neill's plans to shore up what he perceived (and was later proved) to be a weakening economy.  It shows an administration that demand strict adherence and blind loyalty to its views and harshly punished those who didn't toe the line or spoke out against it.  O'Neill's fate was the most telling example.<BR><BR>\\"The Price of Loyalty\\" demonstrates a frightening method to how our current executive administration runs.  While it lacks the strong bite that such a book could carry, it still gives the reader cause to be concerned over the direction this administration is taking us and forces one to re-evaluate whether or not we want another four years of this.	2004-04-27
US	52044836	RRMGQ6JHDPALA	1580621120	906766379	The USS Essex: And the Birth of the American Navy	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Expert history of the Essex and the U.S. Navy	\\"USS Essex\\" is a fine piece of naval literature that does a strong job of depicting the very beginnings of the United States Navy while also telling the history of this remarkable ship.  The USS Essex was the pride and joy of Salem, Massachusetts.  Built in 1799 on the finances of hundreds of `subscriptions' (similar to war bonds) by the local citizenry, the Essex came into existence during a time when the nation as a whole was wary of establishing a government run Naval force.  The arguments against its establishment were that a standing Navy was symbol of the oppression and tyranny of aggressor nations like France and Britain. In addition, the expense of maintaining such a force would be stressful on the finances of a fledgling nation that was still trying desperately to pay down its Revolutionary War debts.  The points in favor of the establishment of a Navy were that American merchant vessels needed protection from aggressive nations, pirates, and the Barbary States of North Africa while conducting trade while also provided a nautical defense of the U.S.' ample Atlantic coastline.  At the time of Essex' construction, state run Naval militias were the accepted form of seafaring force.   The Quasi-War with revolutionary France and the ongoing struggles with the Barbary States (to say nothing of the War of 1812) began to show to the U.S. government the wisdom of having a naval force.<BR><BR>Authors Frances Robotti and James Vescovi have exhaustively searched the history of the Essex, its notable captains and crewmembers, while crafting a thesis that powerfully depicts the U.S. Navy's origin and growth from infancy.  The first half of \\"USS Essex\\" is a bit more of a general Naval history, rather than a record specific to the Essex.  The authors', themselves, concede that the Essex never had the notable confrontations of its more famous brethren like the Bon Homme Richard, USS Constellation, or USS Constitution, or even an infamous demise like the USS Philadelphia.  The Essex was present for portions of the conflict with the Barbary States and had an occasional run-in with a British warship.  It is necessary to take this broader approach before focusing directly on the Essex in order to frame the Essex' role in the evolution of the United States from disrespected rebellious nation to feared world power.  <BR><BR>The Essex was home to such famed captains as Edward Preble, William Bainbridge, and the bold and brash David Porter.  Prior to the end of its service to the United States, it was also home to midshipman, David Glasgow Farragut, a man who would later go on to become the U.S. Navy's first Admiral and distinguish himself during the Civil War.  The authors show how the Essex played an important role in the subduing of the Barbary States.  They also demonstrate, with great detail, the Essex' crucial role in wresting sole domination of a Pacific waterways from the British, while under the command of David Porter.<BR><BR>\\"USS Essex\\" is a tremendous read due to the fact that, not only does it expertly tell the history of this great ship, it also creates vivid imagery of what Naval battles were like back in that time period.  Knowing what it means to `strike the colors', learning the pros and cons of cannons vs. carronades for weaponry, and understanding the unspoken rules of battle and seafaring make this book an invaluable resource for any Navy or history buff.  It is also an enlightening read for anyone who is not as well-versed in our country's great Naval traditions.	2004-04-21

The elder Shaara made quite a name for himself with his fictional, but extremely plausible, account of the crucial Battle of Gettysburg in his seminal novel \\"The Killer Angels\\".  It was fictional only from the standpoint that Michael Shaara assumed the existence of dialogue and minor events in order to personalize and humanize the various historical figures who played a key role in that battle.  Much of those minor events and dialogue were derived from journals, historical records, and conjecture.  The actual larger events are, in themselves, wholly factual.  \\"Killer Angels\\" may be as credible an historical record as any `pure' accounts.  <BR><BR>Jeffrey Shaara has assumed his father's legacy by continuing this genre of historical fiction.  The younger Shaara is probably best known for his novel \\"Gods and Generals\\" (recently made into a movie) which deals with the beginnings of the Civil War up until just before Gettysburg.  \\"Gods and Generals\\" is an excellent novel and I highly recommend it to anyone.  However, I would posit that one his lesser known novels, about a lesser known historical event, may be even better.  \\"Gone for Soldiers\\" is Jeffrey Shaara's account of the largely forgotten Mexican-American War, which ran from 1846-1848.  The reason \\"Gone for Soldiers\\" is such an excellent read lies not only in Shaara's skilled literary style, but in his ability to uncover the stories behind this war that are truly fascinating.  <BR><BR>The Mexican-American War began over boundary disputes between the Mexican government and the newer southwestern states of the United States, most notably Texas (Which had fought Mexico only 12 years earlier to get its own independence).  In an attempt to quell the uprising by the Mexican government, the U.S. Government and President James K. Polk made the egregious error of bringing General Santa Anna back from exile (imposed after he surrendered following the war with Texas) with the belief that he would quell the uprising and re-establish friendly relations with the U.S.  Of course, Santa Anna immediately assumed control of the Mexican government and army and promptly attacked the U.S. forces.  The war then became a quest to get Santa Anna out of power and restore stability to the region.  <BR><BR>The war was fought on two fronts, but Shaara largely ignores General Zachary Taylor's stagnant offensive to the north, choosing instead to focus on the more aggressive and successful amphibious landing by General Winfield Scott's troops to the southeast.  This choice is important because, not only did Scott's offensive play a much larger role in the U.S.' success in the war, but it also introduces the reader to much younger versions of men (under Scott's command) who play crucial roles in our nation's history less than two decades later.  Familiar names like Pickett, Grant, Johnston, Jackson, and Lee first cut their teeth in combat during this conflict.  Later, they play significant roles in our nation's most tragic conflict, the Civil War.  Shaara does an excellent job of revealing the passions, fears, skills, and courage of each individual man, choosing primarily to focus on the young Robert E. Lee.  In following Lee's progress and development from Army engineer to respected combat commander, Shaara enables to see deeper into a man who we only know as the legend he became.  In addition, it is through Lee that we also get to know General Winfield Scott, a general whose war record should put him on the same plateau as such war heroes as U.S. Grant, Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, John Pershing, Dwight Eisenhower, and Douglas MacArthur.  It's a shame that history has seen fit to forget this man.  Shaara does a credible job of reminding us that Scott was a truly remarkable leader.  <BR><BR>Anyone with a love of history would do well to pick up this novel.  \\"Gone for Soldiers\\" is a remarkable accomplishment that belongs right alongside \\"Killer Angels\\" and \\"Gods and Generals\\".	2004-04-20

It is a story so grand and sweeping in its scale that it gives Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\" and Haldeman's \\"Forever War\\" strong competition for the greatest novel written about Earth's future.  What sets it apart from those two books, though, is how it only requires a leap of faith regarding scientific advances to imagining the future \\"The Truth Machine\\" realizes, as opposed to alien intervention affecting the futures in the \\"Childhood's End\\" and \\"Forever War\\".  The author, Halperin, is Harvard educated posits fascinating theories about perilous future of Earth and how the events in this book helped avoid it.  <BR><BR>\\"The Truth Machine\\" has been termed \\"'1984' for our generation\\".  While there are similarities, each book takes a decidedly different view of people having absolute knowledge and no privacy.  \\"1984\\" is about how the government controls the populace through the use of `big brother', a system with which none of the country's citizens are safe from government surveillance and manipulation.  This dark view is contrasted dramatically by Halperin's much more positive view of full disclosure and the methods of achieving it.  <BR><BR>\\"The Truth Machine\\" primarily focuses on the life story of Randall Peterson \\"Pete\\" Armstrong, a child prodigy with total recall memory, whose entire life's outlook has been defined the tragic murder of his younger brother, Leonard, by an ex-convict who was believed to be capable of committing violent crimes again, but could not be imprisoned any longer under the current law structure.  Pete is committed to making a difference for humanity that will atone for his brother's death and help millions of others, too.  In his first year at Harvard (at just age 13!), Pete is recruited to enroll in a small, but exclusive, class of the brightest and most agile students on campus.  In that class, he meets people and establishes friendships that willfurther his identity.  It is there that the idea of a `truth machine' is conceived and Pete realizes that its existence is possible and that he could do it.  The `truth machine' would be a mechanism that would be 100% accurate in determining if a person was lying or telling the truth.  It could help eliminate crime and dishonesty in general.  As long as it is employed universally (and not just by government officials), the `truth machine' could revolutionize humanity and take it to that next evolutionary step which would help it avert its coming self-destruction.<BR><BR>The premise is fascinating and, had it just focused on the development and application of the `truth machine', this would have been a very solid book.  However, \\"The Truth Machine\\" achieves transcendence by becoming a social history of our future.  Over 60 years of time and events are covered in this novel.  Halperin realizes that the company Pete established to design the `truth machine', Armstrong Technologies Inc. (ATI), will have to produce other products in order to keep functioning during the two decade quest to develop its premier product.  Halperin skillfully depicts the formative years of ATI, its development, and the development and growth of the principle people involved.  Halperin also frames each of the story's events masterfully by beginning each chapter with a brief synopsis of world events at that particular point in time.  It enables the reader to put this future into a proper context and understand the urgency and importance that creating the `truth machine' possesses.<BR><BR>What would the impact of such a machine be?  Halperin makes that case that it will help usher the world into period of unprecedented peace and prosperity.  The future is too variable to predict, but dangers and benefits of the future put forth in \\"The Truth Machine\\" are dealt with equally and fairly.

While many of us have a vague recollection of this tale of German private Paul Baumer and his comrades in the midst of World War I (then called the Great War), it doesn't hurt to return to this novel years later and revisit one of the more haunting depictions of war.<br /><br />I personally picked up \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" again more than ten years after I last read it.  I vaguely remembered, but as I started reading, it began to come back to me.  Names like Himmelstoss and Kantorek came forth from my memory.  Tjaden, Muller, and Kat also return to the forefront.  I remembered the bond that these men had (though, not so much Kantorek, and certainly not Himmelstoss).  Yet, I found it difficult to get energized by the story during its first 100 or so pages.  Perhaps it was because the true horrors weren't being depicted yet, only the doldrums of daily life in the German Army on the front lines.  It may also be because I know that the end result of this war was futility that ended up leading to an even greater and more devastating war 20 years later.  Despite this, I was determined to push forward and slowly found my engrossed the journey of these young men from jovial, idealistic youths to battle-weary war veterans before they were even out of their teens.  As I read further, the horror and depression of the midnight mortar attacks and repeated mustard gas assaults began their toll on me the reader.  I began to empathize with the hopelessness and despair these men felt as more of their close friends began to die and the futility of their struggle became obvious.  Reading about the deaths of the comrades was terribly excruciating, but necessary.  Few were lucky enough to die instantly in battle.  Most had to deal with horrific battle wounds which they survived.  Perhaps a leg was amputated, or a portion of one's chest was missing, or one developed a terrible infection from the less than hygienic medical stations.  One thing was for certain; the propaganda-laden `glory' of being a soldier had all but evaporated.<br /><br />Remarque's skilled story telling brings the reader along this journey honestly.  There are no out of place jolts designed to sensationalize this story.  It is an accurate and gripping tale of the horrors of war that you don't get to see or read about on CNN or in the newspapers.  People believing in the glory of war and aggression as the means to solve all problems would be well-served to read \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" many times over.	2004-01-28

I may have been channeling the spirit of Johnny Horton there, but remembering that song causes one to remember the battle it commemorates and the all-too-forgotten war in was a part of.  All that most people know of the War of 1812 was that it was the second time we fought and defeated the British.  Some may know that that was the war when our great national anthem \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" was penned (though most think it was written during the Revolution or Civil War).  Few realize or understand just how important the War of 1812 was to the future of the United States, or just how close this fledgling country came to having its livelihood destroyed.  Even those who know a little more about the war may view the Battle of New Orleans as an unnecessary skirmish coming well after the signing of the peace treaty between Britain and America.  Fortunately, Robert Remini's book, \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\", puts the war into its proper perspective and shows us how important military victory the Battle of New Orleans was.  <BR><BR>For those not familiar, the War of 1812 began because the British would not recognize the sovereignty of the United States and kept conscripting its sailors to assist in Britain's war with France.  In addition, Britain, along with all other European nations, did not respect the United States in general.  The U.S. government believed it needed to take action to secure the safety of its own ships while also sending a loud statement to Europe that this was not a country to be trifled with.  So, they declared war on Britain.  Aside from a few skirmishes, though, the war was not much of note before the parties met to negotiate a peace treaty.  The most notable happenings were the failed U.S. invasion of Canada (still a British colony), the British invasion and burning of Washington D.C., and the famed bombardment of Fort McHenry where the fort's resiliency caused Francis Scott Key to pen our anthem.  While the terms of peace were be negotiated, though, the British forces sensed and opportunity to strike a crippling blow the United States by attempting to capture New Orleans, which would give them control of the Mississippi and essentially end all of the U.S. expansion hopes and keep this nation at only a third of its current size and likely would have slowly choked it to death.  The U.S., recognizing this threat, sent a ragtag force commanded by General (not Colonel, as from the song) Andrew Jackson to fortify and defend the city against British aggression.  <BR><BR>It is Remini's assertion that the ensuing conflict, which at one point included a skirmish where over 1000 British soldiers were killed to only 8 for the U.S., was the first true military victory for this young nation.  He contends that the key battles of Saratoga and Yorktown during the Revolution were more surrenders than decisive military victories and, for that reason, Britain still did not respect the United States because they did feel that they had truly lost.  Even most of the War 1812 was devoid of any decisive engagements.  While Remini's opinion of those last battles of the Revolution are highly debatable, there is no doubting his claim that the resounding victory at the Battle of New Orleans was landmark achievement in the development of United States as a legitimate nation and a fledgling world power.  Remini does a fine job setting up the battle and chronicling all the dramatic twists and turns that took place.  Reading this book is essential to understanding the importance of the Battle of New Orleans and, on a greater scale, the War of 1812.  At just 240 pages, it is a quick read.  Yet, it gives the reader a wealth of detail regarding that battle.  It's a definite must for any history buff.	2004-01-06

It's well known that Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower were never close working partners, even prior to the epic, decade-long feud that began during the 1952 election.  It's a stretch to building a book on the premise of such a partnership and Neal does very little support his theory.  Harry and Ike were two men who initially had great respect for each other and occasionally worked together on issues of common interest, but otherwise had little to do with one another.  The failure to make a case otherwise should have torpedoed this book.  What saves it, however, is that, even with the flawed premise, it is a fascinating historical record. <BR><BR>While Neal is unable support his premise, he does an excellent job and revealing the histories and backgrounds of these titans among men.  He tracks their lives and developments independently until their disparate paths crossed during the last, mad days of World War II.  From there, Neal uses the framework of this supposed friendship to provide informative and interesting accounts of history as it happened during that era.  He covers moments like Truman offering to step aside and run as Eisenhower's Vice President in 1948 if Ike were to run as a Democrat (possibly the foundation of Neal's assertion of a `close' relationship).  He covers the major events like the hostile 1952 Presidential election, the beginning of the Korean War, and firing of General Douglas MacArthur.  Neal uses these events to show the impact it had on each man and the reactions it prompted.  <BR><BR>\\"Harry and Ike\\" serves as a good primer for studying the historical events of that time.  It has the effect of making the reader want to probe deeper into those events. Reading this book led me to seek out and read the incredible Douglas MacArthur biography \\"American Caesar\\".  Given that strong historical narrative of \\"Harry and Ike\\", Steve Neal should not be penalized too much for his flimsy premise.  There's no doubting that it still serves as an effective historical record.	2004-01-06

The politics behind the attack and the revisionist histories that want to lay culpability at the feet of Franklin Roosevelt are irrelevant in this book.  Walter Lord's compelling account deals briefly with the groundwork the Japanese laid to execute this attack.  Then it rolls right into a gripping minute-by-minute account of the pre-attack activities, the attack itself, and the response in the aftermath.  <BR><BR>History, when presented in the worst form, can seem static and boring.  When history is presented in its best form, it comes alive, captivating the reader and transporting them to the events and making them know the people they are reading about.  Though a brief account, Walter Lord's \\"Day of Infamy\\" succeeds admirably in making that day come alive.  It transports the readers to Hawaii on that terrible December morning and involves them in the events of that day.  That, alone, makes this a book worth reading.	2004-01-05

If nothing else, Margaret MacMillan's book on the on the World War I peace conference, \\"Paris 1919\\", shows exactly how complex, intricate, and convoluted the politics were that began the war and would dictate the post war actions.  It's nothing short of amazing how deeply MacMillan probed in order to make the serpentine mess of the Paris Peach Conference accessible to the lay reader.  Most people superficially know that the Treaty of Versailles imposed harsh penalties on Germany for World War I and that Hitler used the national anger towards this treaty as his means of rising to power.  Of course, that is a gross oversimplification.  In truth, the terms of the Treaty were not as harsh as people make them out to be and the language of the treaty made it essentially impotent in enforcing those terms.  By the time Hitler had rendered the treaty null and void, Germany had only paid about 10 percent of the reparations they were scheduled to.  Discoveries like this are present throughout \\"Paris 1919\\".  <BR><BR>MacMillan emphasizes the flaws of the Council of Four and how that affected their ability to develop an effect peace accord.  France and Italy were the most greedy and demanding members of that Council, yet Italy had never won a single battle and France was saved from utter disaster only by the intervention of the United States in 1917.  The other two members flopped as well.  British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, frequent demonstrated his lack of political acumen and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was both intractable with regards to his `Fourteen Points' declaration and nebulous with his definition of what national `self-determination' meant.  With a leadership like this, it's hardly surprising that this treaty became such a debacle.  On the other side, the Germans felt their dealings with the Council were quite suspect.  For starters, many Germans even questioned if they had lost the war, given that no fighting had even occurred on the German soil prior to the armistice.  Second, they felt that the punishments that were to be levied on their country should not be that severe, given that they had expelled the leadership responsible for the aggressive actions that started this war (including Kaiser Wilhelm, himself).  <BR><BR>In the midst of the conflicts between the major powers, there were still many issues to contend with and fires that had yet to be put out.  While the main body of fighting ended in 1918, different ethnic and geographic skirmishes connected to this war continued well into the 1920's.  Turkey and Greece kept fighting for many years after World War I ended.  Many of the Baltic States made their grabs for land and influence while also contending with the collapse of the empire of Austria-Hungary.  Unnatural nations were built, like Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.  Much of this occurred outside the realm of the Council of Four's focus.  Then, there is the little matter of the Russian Bolshevik threat and the Japan's Pacific land grab, both of which received scant attention from the peacemakers (except for a brief expeditionary force sent to Siberia with an unclear goals in trying to contain bolshevism).  <BR><BR>This is just the tip of the iceberg with regards to the wealth of information MacMillan gives to the reader.  At times, the material can seem ponderous, but this is due to some of the subject matter.  There is also the tendency of MacMillan to jump around events and briefly get redundant.  These are minor quibbles, though, when one considers the rich, brilliant narrative that the author has provided in helping to unlock the mysteries and myths surrounding the peace conference that eventually ensured, as one quipster put it, `a just and lasting war'.	2004-01-05

Even if it lacks a deep story or meaningful characters, \\"Starship Titanic\\" still has many things going for it.  For starters, it's a short book, clocking in at a reasonable 256 pages and it reads very fast.  Second, it was written by former Monty Pythonite, Terry Jones (in the nude, no less, according to the introduction), which gives it such and absurd, off-the-wall effect that one cannot help but be amused and drawn in by this book.  <BR><BR>The story of a wayward luxury spaceliner that finds itself (and a few unwelcome passengers) transported from its planetary system to the one that houses Earth.  Some earthbound humans end up boarding the ship for the adventure and then try frantically to get the ship to take them back home when they realize it's leaving Earth.  On top of that, saboteurs from the other planetary system have planted a super-deluxe bomb aboard to destroy the ship.  The humans want to get back home, the designers of the ship want to prevent the bombing to save their economy, and everyone is trying to figure why they can't seem to get an upgrade to First Class even though they're the only people on the ship.  It's unbelievable the level of absurdity that takes place in this book, but there is no doubting how much fun it is.  There is a space battle against a species that tries fix everything it damaged after a battle even though they don't fire weapons that can do any damage; there's an intriguing sexual encounter between the Journalist from the other system and a human female in the desperate seconds before they think the bomb will destroy them all and the subsequent attempts by the Journalist to get that female to repeat the performance; and then there's the bomb, itself.  Lacking a special memory crystal, the countdown for this bomb cannot bystopped.  Yet, it seems possible to distract him from the countdown, causing him to lose his place and have to start over again.<BR><BR>Having yet to read Adam's \\"Hitchhiker's Trilogy\\" (now at five books), I cannot comment as to how this little tale fits into the overall arc of that story and how it meshes with his writing style.  That being said, Jones' Pythonesque influence makes this one of the craziest books to come along in awhile and definitely worth reading.	2004-01-02

His \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", written with and filmed by Stanley Kubrick, is viewed as one of the seminal works in science fiction history.  Obviously, Clarke didn't make his career out of one single book (and movie).  He has been quite a prodigious, and proficient, writer.  In addition to writing three sequels to the \\"2001\\" saga, he also wrote the best-selling \\"Rama\\" series, numerous single novels like \\"Hammer of God\\" and \\"Songs of Distant Earth\\", and untold numbers of short stories.  His stories have won just about every conceivable award for this genre and have achieved the dual goal of garnering critical praise and popular approval.  Of all his novels, though, it may be one of his earliest that still stands as his best. <BR><BR>\\"Childhood's End\\" was first published in 1953, a time when the cold war was in full form and people were beginning to truly look towards the stars for other life and possibilities for exploration.  \\"Childhood's End\\" tapped into that fertile imagination to craft a story of profound scale and meaning.  It begins one day when numerous spaceships suddenly appear in the sky above Earth.  They are flown by an alien species referred to as the Overlords.  The purpose of their journey to third planet of the Solar System is subject to much speculation and fear.  These aliens seem to be a benevolent race that only wants to help humanity solve the problems that plague it.  In fifty years, these Overlords will end ignorance, poverty, war, and disease.  To what end do they do this, though?  The absence of any obstacles and struggles renders humanity complacent and inert.  Is this designed to make Earth pliable for invasion, or is there a greater, more benevolent purpose behind these actions by the Overlords?  <BR><BR>\\"Childhood's End\\" is an appropriate title as it references the end of humanity's childhood.  The Overlords are on a quest to condition thepeople of Earth for it's new role in the order of the Universe.  Current humanity will not be able to handle what is asked of them, but through the generations they can be evolved to be prepared to take their next step.  \\"Childhood's End\\", in the space of a mere 224 pages tells the stories of the different steps of this evolution in an episodic manner that is rich in detail and profound in meaning.  Clarke is fascinated by the potentials of human destiny.  Sometimes, as with \\"Light of Other Days\\", he is not as successful in realizing that destiny as he is in other stories.  \\"Childhood's End\\", though, extraordinarily realizes what humanity can become and its importance to strive towards that.  \\"Childhood's End\\" is as relevant and compelling and novel in 2003 as it was in 1953.	2003-12-30

Lewis is a name that many children and their parents know by heart.  In school and long after, they fell in love with his much beloved 7-volume \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\".  In addition to that seminal work, Lewis was also noted for his profound takes on Christianity, whether he wrote purely theological books or weaved Christian themes into his fictional novels.  One of his more celebrated efforts is his \\"Space Trilogy\\" consisting of the three books: \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"Perelandra\\", and \\"That Hideous Strength\\".  Having yet to read \\"That Hideous Strength\\", I am unable to comment on the overall arc of this trilogy.  Though, I can make assessments out of what I have read.  <BR><BR>The first book in this series is \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\"; a short 160 pages, but by no means a quick read.  It focuses on the travels of this series' hero, the estimable Dr. Ransom as he is kidnapped by two devious scientists, Doctors Weston and Devine, and flown out of Earth (the aforementioned `silent planet') and whisked to the alien planet of Malacandra (the native name for world we know as Mars).  Initially fearful of being sacrificed by Weston and Devine to an indigenous Malacandran species known as sorns, Dr. Ransom escapes once they land upon the world and begins and journey where he meets many of the indigenous species, among them, the subservient hrossa and even the sorns he so feared.  In his journeys, Ransom is struck with awe and wonder at the magical visual world he sees, from the lush, fertile valleys that are only visible from the planet surface to the more desolate, but no less intriguing, mountaintops where few of the indigenous lifeforms still reside.  His travels provide a strong allegorical reference to biblical themes and Christian doctrine.  Malacandra provides a glimpse of what Earth could have been if it had never suffered the fall of Original Sin.  All Malacandran life is governed by a benevolent being known as the Oyarsa, who is subservient only to the being referred to as Maleldil (though easy to view as God, himself).  The Oyarsa of Malacandra laments no longer hearing from the Oyarsa of Thulucandra (\\"The Silent Planet\\" aka Earth), who is referred to as the one who is `bent' or \\"gone bad\\".  Ransom is to ponder the significance of what he has observed and consider how to use that knowledge.  As Malacandra is further from the Sun than the Earth, its indigenous life has been around much longer and can serve as an example its wayward sibling.  <BR><BR>Small print-type, complex sentence structure, and long paragraphs all combine to make reading \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" (and the rest of the \\"Space Trilogy\\") a challenge to those who are not used to Lewis' writings.  Even at 160 pages, multiple readings are recommended in order to absorb all of the themes presented in this book, but don't think that reading \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" isn't a worthwhile endeavor.  Much can be gleaned from its pages and more can be pondered after reading it.	2003-12-30

Books	5	11	16	N	N	Moore tackles the issues that few are brave enough to	Author/filmmaker/political pundit Michael Moore has a number of things working against him.  For starters, he looks a bit like a slob.  While one wouldn't think that this should have anything to do with the political message being put forth, politics has proven to have as much to do with image as substance.  Second, he has become scourge of the conservative movement by attacking issues and causes near and dear to the conservative heart (Big business in \\"Roger and Me\\", the National Rifle Association and gun ownership in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\", both well-received documentaries).  Third, he has a reputation for framing facts to fit his agenda.  Finally, his self-serving speech at the 2003 Oscars did nothing to endear him to those who are already wary of him and his message.  <BR><BR>Let's address these strikes.  As mentioned above, image counts for a great deal.  The neo-conservative movement powered by Fox News puts on this image of professional, button-down commentators who give you the unbiased truth.  A nice suit does not mean that the person is honest anymore than Moore's baseball cap and jeans means his a dishonest, clueless individual.  Where it comes to be the scourge of the conservative movement, Moore should be applauded.  In post-9/11 world, where a spate of conservative mouthpieces of emerged all across the airwaves to discourage dissension of any kind, Moore's boat rocking is relevant and necessary.  As far as framing the facts to fit his agenda, well there is no political commentator out there who doesn't do this.  You think Bill O'Reilly or Ann Coulter don't do the exact same thing in the conservative literary rants?  It's the nature of beast in this genre.  The only strike against Moore that sticks is his performance at the Oscars.  It was unnecessary and seen by most (including his strong supporters) as self-serving and self-promotional.  Yet, everyone in the public eye has had moments like those, so let's digress. <BR><BR>So, what is the purpose of all this background?  It's to set the table for this review of Michael Moore's latest book, the highly relevant and important \\"Dude, Where's my Country?\\"  Don't let the goofy title throw you off and make you think of bad Ashton Kutcher movies (is there such a thing as a good Ashton Kutcher movie?).  \\"Dude, Where's my Country?\\" tackles the most important issues to face this country since that horrible Fall day in 2001.  Since that time, we've been encouraged to not question President Bush and his administration on any aspect of his 'War or Terror'.  We're not to question the civil rights destroying legislation that is being passed; we're not to question the connections of the Bush family to parties who may have been complicit in 9/11 (Moore does not, for any moment, imply that Bush had anything to do with that awful day the way many revisionists damn Franklin Roosevelt for Pearl Harbor.  He mere highlights the fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi and that Bush's cozy ties with them may very well provide a real hindrance in this war.); we're not to question the many wars that Bush has started or is threatening to start in the name of National Security; and, of course, we're certainly not supposed to question the shady business dealings that have destroyed the economy in the past two years or the strong connections these business CEOs have to the Bush Administration.  Fear powers this current government and Moore seeks to break its hold on the people to they can return to doing what makes this country great (questioning dissenting, striving for change).<BR><BR>Now, it may seem like this book serves as just a hatchet job against the Bush administration and conservatives in general.  To take that view and avoid reading this book for that reason is a mistake because you will be missing many of the very salient points made by Michael Moore.  Moore is here to help remind the public that post-9/11 legislation like the Patriot Act and its yet-to-be-passed successor, Patriot Act II, are the biggest threats to personal freedoms since the ethnic internments during World War II and are the most shameful pieces of 'patriotic' legislation since the Alien and Sedition Acts during this country's infancy.  Moore reminds us that this war with Iraq (which I personally support because I believe in the end result of removing Saddam Hussein) was started under false pretenses and done so by sticking a big middle finger up at the rest of the world that opposed military action.  Even more important is Moore's reminder of evil actions wrought upon America by corporate big wigs such as Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Bernard Ebbers upon the public.  These corporate CEOs, who are already rich beyond relative standards (just witness the fact that the average British CEO makes 24 times what his average employee makes, while U.S. CEOs make 411 (!) times as much as the average worker), still felt the need to squeeze a dime wherever they could and swindled the public, defrauded their own employees, and generally destroyed corporate trust in general just to horde more in the wealth among the fewest people possible.  Relations with Bush and Cheney have, of course, prevented any real action from being taken against these men or restitution being given to the employees whose life savings where eradicated.  Michael Moore calls these men the 'real terrorists' and he may very well be right.  <BR><BR>\\"Dude, Where's my Country?\\" asks the questions that few are brave enough to ask and tackles issues that few wish to address.  Moore does this all while never once getting sanctimonious or belligerent.  He takes a generally upbeat approach to his topics and his belief that there are solutions.  Michael Moore, you are to be applauded for your efforts with this book.	2003-12-29

Clarke was the writing force behind Stanley Kubrick's seminal movie, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\".  Clark continued that series with \\"2010\\", \\"2061\\", and \\"3001\\".  The \\"Space Odyssey\\" series may be his most commercially well known, but he also wrote highly acclaimed sci-fi novels such as \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"Songs of Distant Earth\\", and \\"The Hammer of God\\".  In short, Clarke is one the most prolific and proficient science-fiction authors of our time.  In addition to the novels mentioned above, Clarke was responsible for authoring the wildly successful \\"Rama\\" series (four books, the last three he co-authored with Gentry Lee).  The first in that series, \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" was awarded every conceivable honor for this genre of writing; the Hugo, Nebula, and Jupiter awards among others.  Having recently read \\"Rendezvous...\\", it's clear to see that those accolades were well-deserved.  <BR><br />Clarke has always been viewed as a purveyor of `pure' science-fiction.  By that, I mean that he applies real science and real situations to the dealings people have extraterrestrial events and species.  This is almost a polar-opposite of the type of science-fiction available in novels like \\"Star Wars\\", where the space opera and human drama are the prime elements while real science takes a back seat.  A particular area of interest for Clarke has been the subject of `first contact' where humanity first comes in contact with an alien species.  \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" is one of the subject's best examples.  Instead of the aliens of similar construction and environment as in \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Rendezvous...\\" presents a species that is vastly different from anything the humans can conceive of.  It is so different that they may not even recognize the humans at all, while humans can merely hope to grasp at the purpose and function of these extraterrestrials.  <BR><BR>In the early 22nd century, the Spaceguard System designed to protect all the inhabited worlds of the United Planets from threatening comets and asteroids has picked an object barreling through the Solar System at an incredible speed and uncomfortably close to the inhabited worlds.  Upon realizing that this object shows none of the characteristics of a naturally occurring phenomena (in fact, it is a perfectly designed cylinder approximately 150 kilometers by 30), the United Planets commissions the space ship, Endeavour (the only ship close enough and fast enough to catch this object) to rendezvous with this new entity that is being called `Rama'.  Upon the arrival to Rama, the astronauts of Endeavour find ready-made access ways to the inside of this massive structure and, once inside, discover a scene that nearly defies human comprehension.  Although vision is initially hampered by the darkened environment, it becomes clear that the inside of Rama is actually a self-contained biosphere, complete with a frozen sea, naturally occurring landforms, and what appears to be constructed cities.  There does not seem to be any signs of life, but, given the enormity of the structure, there are plenty of places to explore and hopes run high at discovering the mystery of Rama.  Unfortunately, the crew Endeavour only has a few weeks to conduct its explorations.  The Sunward trajectory of Rama is rapidly bringing it to the point of perihelion from which Endeavour could not survive the extreme temperatures.  Back on the Moon (the home of the United Planets headquarters) a committee has been established to observe the developments on, and with regard to, Rama and make the best recommendations about how to proceed.  In addition, there is also unpleasant internal strife courtesy of the colonists of Mercury, the Hermians, who fear what Rama's existence means for there place in the Solar System.<BR><BR>What makes \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" such an impressive novel is how genuine the human reactions to Rama are.  They are initially fearful and then very curious.  When the astronauts enter the main of Rama, they are first awed by the shear enormity of the environment they have entered and later, when a sudden light source has illuminated Rama's interior, they are astounded by the beauty and complexity of this self-contained world.  Clarke's special literary skills convey this emotion to the readers so that they feel like they are a member of the Endeavour's crew, stumbling upon a new world and new existence that had never been conceived of before.  Clarke is honest in his portrayal of the human desire know all the answers to a puzzle whose answers are impossible to obtain.  \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" leaves many more questions than answers.  Yet, that is the point.  Humanity is not on the same level of evolution, technologically or physically, with an alien species that has the capability traverse interstellar distances.  It cannot possibly hope to understand the mysteries of a species that can do this.  It is the questions that humanity is left to ponder that make this encounter so much more fulfilling than any answers that there may be.	2003-12-11

Michael Veron created a little tale of golf fiction that caught the golf world by surprise with its wonderful mix of mystery and golf history called \\"The Greatest Player Who Never Lived\\".  While undoubtedly a fictional work, the strength of Veron's writing and research forced readers to continually read the disclaimer at the beginning of the book that asserted that these events were fictional.  \\"...Greatest Player...\\" told the story of a young law school student named Charley Hunter, who was working a summer internship for the law firm of Butler &amp; Yates, legendary golfer and Augusta National founder, Bobby Jones, old law firm.  Given an assignment to organize all off Jones' old office files, Hunter uncovered a mystery about an unknown golfer named Beau Stedman.  The quest by Hunter to unravel this mystery was compelling.  Combined with a backdrop just dripping with golf history, \\"...Greatest Player...\\" created a story with such plausibility and such reverence for the game of golf, that reader could not help but be awed by this tale.  <BR><BR>A year later, Veron rode used the success of \\"The Greatest Player Who Never Lived\\" to write a sequel called, \\"The Greatest Course that Never Was\\".  It continues the story of Charley Hunter, now a full-time associate at Butler &amp; Yates and a well regarded for his efforts in bringing the Beau Stedman story to life.  As Charley is getting his feet wet in the judicial process, he starts receiving mysterious letters containing obituaries of men he had never heard of with a cryptic notes included.  When he receives a letter containing a mysterious golf scorecard, Charley begins the smell another mystery that requires his investigation.  Charley discovers that this mystery also has a connection with Bobby Jones and Augusta National.  His travels take him to the home of one Moonlight McIntyre, an 80+ year old man who had caddied at Augusta National and been a friend of Mr. Jones'from the earliest days.  Moonlight has the secret of another golf course, as amazing as Augusta, that no one knows about except Jones, Augusta co-founder, Clifford Roberts, and any one they deemed worthy to play that course.  Moonlight knows his life has reached its twilight and he wants the story and knowledge of this course to be passed on.  Wanting to find the right man to trust this information to, Moonlight contacts Charley because of the latter's efforts on behalf of Beau Stedman (who was a friend of Moonlight's).  For Charley, this launches another journey of uncovering the mysteries of Moonlight and this course, seeing and playing the course for himself, and also finding away to preserve the course from those who would do it harm while also honoring its history.  <BR><BR>\\"The Greatest Course that Never Was\\" has the unfortunate task of being the sequel to the amazing piece of work that was \\"The Greatest Player Who Never Lived\\".  It's a quick read and succeeds in uncovering another mystery while educating readers about even more golf history.   One of the weaknesses of this book's is that this mystery just doesn't have the same resonance that the Beau Stedman story did.  The descriptions of the course are fabulous and the interplay between Charley and Moonlight is quite amusing, but the reader will not find the same emotional investment in this story.  After, the story of a piece of land really can't compare with the gripping tale on one man's life.  This book also suffers from not producing a terribly satisfactory conclusion to this mystery.  A twist is introduced in the final few chapters that, while intriguing, undermines the mission of these men up to this point.  There is not the same kind of payoff was in this book's predecessor when Beau Stedman's tale came to light and he was afforded the honors and recognition that he had been unfairly denied his whole life.  Complaints aside, though, there's still nothing too wrong with a book that is a fast read andcontinues to honor the rich history of golf.	2003-12-11
US	52044836	RLYUD5NBW5YAI	0891416315	81743824	Fighting the Bolsheviks: The Russian War Memoir of Private First Class Donald E. Carey, U.S. Army, 1918-1 919	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Memoir of a little known event should have been so much more	Tales of World War I are often the most overlooked in military history.  Everyone knows the war happened; many know the parties involved; few even know the causes of that war.  Yet, it typically serves as a footnote to its much bloodier, more devastating, and clearer cut offspring of two decades later.  Those who know some of World War I do know that November 11th, 1918 served as the day of the armistice between the Allied and Central Powers, ostensibly declaring the end of the physical portion of the war and the beginning of the treaty negotiations.  What few people know is that fighting involving the Allies continued almost a full year after Armistice Day, but it didn't involve any of the defeated Central powers.  With Russia having had to withdraw from the Great War in 1917 because of the Bolshevik rebellion, many western nations looked to that country with fear of the new `red menace' that was being propagated by the Bolsheviks and Communists.  As a result, during the dying days of World War I, the Allies sent what amounted to a police force to such northern Russian provinces as Siberia to contain the Bolshevik threat.  Some skirmishes were fought, men died, but in the end, nothing much changed.  The Bolsheviks still controlled all of Russia and sat as an impending threat to the west and the Allies who were involved in this action were disillusioned by the weather and the need to continue fighting well after their compatriots on the Western Front had returned home.  <BR><BR>Very little has been written about this specific military action.  However, one of the privates in the U.S. Army who served in Bolshevik campaign did keep an extensive memoir from beginning of basic training until being relieved from duty at the end of this action.  \\"Fighting the Bolsheviks\\" is Private Donald E. Carey's remembrance of that difficult time.  One of Carey's sons edited his father's journal and filled in the missing elements that would enable the reader to better understand whatwas happening there.  Unfortunately, \\"Fighting the Bolsheviks\\" isn't a very good book.  It's possible that this is because Donald Carey only intended his journal to be a personal or family record, but there's no getting around the boring, dry nature of the narrative and the events that take place.  Carey does convey the monotony and misery of the environment he served in, as well as the tremendous displeasure he and his fellow American soldiers felt at being enduring the patronizing attitudes of their British superiors.  The problem stems from Carey's preoccupation with needing to make constant reference to and commentary on things like the camp VD inspections, immoral actions (read: sex) by fellow soldiers, and his strong dislike for his British superiors.  While the dislike of the British faction can be understood, Carey's obsession with the carnal behaviors of his fellow soldiers seems self-righteous and distracting.  The first time it's mentioned and Carey expresses his revulsion for those behaviors because of his devout faith, we get it.  We don't need to keep `getting it' throughout the rest of the book.  It almost seems as though the battles fought are merely glossed over so that Carey can launch into another moral commentary about his colleagues.  This is tremendously disappointing and renders what should an insightful look into a largely unknown event into a ponderous and tasking read.  \\"Fighting the Bolsheviks\\" could have been so much more.  It's too bad that it's not.	2003-12-08
US	52044836	R3KU2SWCJ8FWUK	0441008763	496933037	The Coming	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Decent, but somewhat disappointing, sci-fi tale	Joe Haldeman is quite the enigmatic science fiction author.  He has the ability to create brilliant narrative, such as \\"The Forever War\\", yet still produce disappointing stories like the previously mentioned books sequel \\"Forever Free\\" and this book \\"The Coming\\".  \\"The Coming\\" is a quick read with a relatively interesting premise, and given the fact that this book didn't make me angry, uncomfortable, or profoundly disappointed, I will marginally recommend it with three stars.  If it were a longer, more involved book, I might be compelled to change that opinion.  <BR><BR>\\"The Coming\\" focuses on the impact on the scientific community and society in general of a message seemingly from an alien species telling humanity `We're coming' and to be prepared for their arrival on New Year's Day.  What enables part of this story to work is that Haldeman does a credible job of representing realistic responses to such an event.  The U.S. Government and military want to remove the scientist who discovered this message from the project so that they can take control and exact a military response if necessary (`if necessary' to this government meaning `we're going to attack what we don't understand and we do fear').  There is panic among some segments of society and a variety of conspiracies hatched to thwart the various government plans for responding to this alien greeting or threat.  In addition to representing panic, which is a stock sci-fi plot development, Haldeman also focuses on the much larger portion of the population that is enormously intrigued (if not terrified) by this event and are thirsting for any drop of information about `the coming'.  One only needs to look back in the past two years with such monumental events as 9/11, Space Shuttle Columbia, and Gulf War: Part Two to realize that this representation by Haldeman is much closer to true reality than any form of panic.  <BR><BR>Alas, for all these positive aspects, \\"The Coming\\" does have numerous failings that put this book on the fence between a positive or negative recommendation.  The first deals with an aspect of Haldeman's writing that pervades all of his novels; that being his insistence on injecting overt sexuality that borders on literary pornography into his stories.  In some instances, it works.  In \\"The Forever War\\", the loosening of tightened morals and rampant promiscuity was used to demonstrate the dramatic change in society and societal values brought about by time and circumstance.  While some of the descriptions were graphic, they fit the overall story arc.  In \\"The Coming\\", the sexuality references seem nothing more than gratuitous eroticism and have little or nothing to do with the plot.  One who is not familiar with Haldeman's work might instantly be soured on him by these story elements.  Those who are more knowledgeable about his work will expect this, but still find it gratuitous.  <BR><BR>The other failing deals with the fact that, despite an enormous buildup to the New Year's Day arrival by these messengers, the payoff is decidedly disappointing.  I won't go into detail, because the reader should read it for themselves, but it leaves much to be desired.  \\"The Coming\\" is not a bad book; it is just not a particularly good one.  It certainly has its good moments as well as its not so good ones.  At just over 200 pages, though, it's worth checking out.	2003-12-05
US	52044836	R1FCIWU12SXAPW	0345428528	713415479	The Unifying Force (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 19)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Spectacular conclusion to an amazing saga	At long last, the end of the New Jedi Order series and the genocidal Yuuzhan Vong war has come to pass.  After five years, 19 books (plus assorted e-book mini-novels), not to mention several acts of tragedy and heroism, the climatic book has arrived.  With the length and breadth of the New Jedi Order series, there is a tremendous pressure that lays on the shoulder of the author whose task it is to conclude this epic in a manner which resolves every outstanding plot development, does not cheat the audience with any `too convenient' endings, and gives the readers a true satisfaction with the finale and the scope of the entire series.  This great responsibility was placed in the hands (and pen) of James Luceno, the author of the \\"Agents of Chaos\\" Duology (\\"Hero's Trial\\" and \\"Jedi Eclipse\\").  This was some cause of concern because Luceno wrote the only two New Jedi Order novels that I found to be lacking.  The \\"Agents of Chaos\\" Duology wasn't necessarily bad; it just suffered from the `middle book (books?)' syndrome of trying to further the story while knowing that no definitive conclusions could be reached.  Trepidation and anticipation competed equally as I began \\"The Unifying Force\\", the final chapter in the New Jedi Order saga.  With great relief and equal amounts of excitement, I am happy to report that Luceno nailed this one out of the park.  <BR><BR>Fears that a lackluster story and cop-out developments would plague this story the way they have the Star Wars prequel movies have proven unfounded.  Where the previous 18 novels did a grand job of setting up a dramatic finale, \\"The Unifying Force\\" does a spectacular job of realizing that finale.  In a genocidal war between the Galactic Alliance (nee' New Republic) and the alien race known as the Yuuzhan Vong, hundreds of worlds were captured, hundreds of billions of lives were lost, and tragedy even affected the characters we loved most with the deaths of Chewbacca and Anakin Solo, it becomes necessary to resolve theconflict in a manner that honors all the sacrifices that were made.  Luceno creates pure literary magic in this endeavor.  He manages to explore the true impetus behind the Yuuzhan Vong's mission to this galaxy and the species true origins.  He also expands on the true nature and purpose of Zonoma Sekot, provides the gripping narrative for the spectacular and harrowing attempt by the Galactic Alliance to recapture the homeworld Coruscant (now known as Yuuzhantar), and grants appropriately satisfying destinies for our heroes and such reprehensible Yuuzhan Vong like Supreme Overlord Shimrra and Nom Anor.<BR><BR>Luceno does not miss a trick in \\"The Unifying Force\\".  The growing discontent and civil unrest among Yuuzhan Vong proved to be one of the most compelling aspects of the latter half of the New Jedi Order novels, reaching its apex with the defections of such elevated members of Vong society as Master Shaper Nen Yim and High Priest Harrar in the previous book \\"The Final Prophecy\\".  The understanding of this unrest and its impact on the Yuuzhan Vong is what makes the final resolutions all the more satisfying.  <BR><BR>With so many loose story threads to tie up and the hull-crushing pressure of not failing the New Jedi Order fans the way the prequels have failed fans of the original Star Wars movies, Luceno writing manages to more than meet that task and gives all Star Wars fans a truly special ending to such and emotional and gripping saga.	2003-12-02

After months and years of the Yuuzhan Vong pushing and conquering the New Republic/Galactic Alliance inhabitants all across the galaxy (including capturing the capital homeworld, Coruscant, now known as Yuuzhan'tar), the Alliance finally struck back and began putting the Vong on the defensive.  These two opposing forces have finally created the irresistible force meeting the immovable object syndrome.  The tension builds and one of the sides will have to break.  <BR><BR>The forces in play on both sides portend of a spectacular climax.  An Alliance Expeditionary Force, led by Luke Skywalker, finally located the living planet Zonoma Sekot, seeming the last hope for ending the hostilities that have plagued the galaxy.  On Yuuzhan'tar, dissention continues to permeate the ranks of the Yuuzhan Vong.  A politically motivated move by disgraced executor, Nom Anor, to regain power has now gained a force stronger than anything he can control.  Using a 'masquer' to conceal his identity and playing upon the reverence the Shamed Ones of the Vong have for the Jedi, Anor created a rebellious movement that has infected all levels of Yuuzhan Vong culture, including certain members of the inner circle of Supreme Overlord Shimmra.  What's more, Shimmra's claim of an alleged mandate from the gods to continue to pursue this genocidal conflict is slowly coming under scrutiny.  It's becoming obvious to some that Shimmra may actually be a fraud and much of what he preaches, and much of what is central to Yuuzhan Vong culture, may prove to be earth-shatteringly false.  So lays the groundwork for the events that take place in the penultimate story of the New Jedi Order series, \\"The Final Prophecy\\". <BR><BR>Though there is a space battle around the famed Bilbringi Shipyards that involves favorites like Wedge Antilles, Garm Bel Iblis, and Jaina Solo, the primary focus of \\"The Final Prophecy\\" deals with an unlikely truce between higher members of the Yuuzhan Vong and select Alliance members (the oft-absent Corran Horn and the enigmatic Tahiri).  These Yuuzhan Vong, specifically master shaper and heretic, Nen Yim, wish to seek the truth about the existence of the living planet, the honor of the Jedi, and possible treachery committed by Shimmra.  With assistance from High Priest Harrar (a powerful Yuuzhan Vong whose dissident nature is still clandestine), Nen Yim makes contact with the Prophet Yu'Shaa, the leader of the Shamed Ones movement, with the intent of making a secret plea to Galactic Alliance to seek out Zonoma Sekot.  Unbeknownst to anyone, Yu'Shaa is really Nom Anor, and Anor plans to use this truce as a means to further his own political agenda.  The results of this unlikely and unholy alliance are among the most compelling twists so far in the New Jedi Order series. <BR><BR>There are a few things to be said.  For starters, it is nice to see Corran Horn back in the fold.  He has essentially been MIA since the \\"Edge of Victory\\" duology and he was sorely missed.  It helps that he was not forced back into the series with an unnatural storyline.  He is paired with Tahiri to 'capture' Nen Yim and proceed on to Zonoma Sekot.  In Corran's last significant appearance in the NJO, Tahiri was a major factor and there was much that happened between them.  Putting them back together and referencing their past was a very smart move.  Tahiri has become an even more intriguing character now that she is becoming more at one with the combination of her human and Yuuzhan Vong personalities.  She continues to the wild card that keeps events intriguing.  <BR><BR>What is most fascinating about \\"The Final Prophecy\\" is seeing the divide that is taking place among the Yuuzhan Vong.  Nom Anor's antics are nothing new, so his actions throughout are no surprise.  However, the fact that Vong as high up as a Master Shaper (Nen Yim) and a High Priest (Harrar) doubt Shimmra and beginto develop a respect for the Jedi foreshadows greater dissention among the Yuuzhan Vong.  It's become clear that the end result will not be the eradication of Yuuzhan Vong from the galaxy, so it becomes necessary to adjust to the concept of the Vong and the galaxy residents co-inhabiting peacefully.  Zonoma Sekot holds the secrets of how this might actually happen, but it's the interactions between Tahiri and Corran with Harrar and Nen Yim that make it seem as though this is a possible destiny.  <BR><BR>\\"The Final Prophecy\\" is a quick read at 300 pages.  The end seems near, yet it seems still very much in doubt.  It leaves the reader hungry for the final novel \\"The Unifying Force\\" and gives a fascinating look at what the future could possibly hold for the galaxy.	2003-10-10
US	52044836	R9E96FMUWY9KA	0553568728	56129005	The Truce at Bakura (Star Wars)	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Flat and slow, but still compelling	&quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot;, while not the first book to be published in the Star Wars Expanded Universe (Timothy Zahn's &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; has that honor), it is the first chronological story to take place after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.  Literally hours after the final battle above the Endor moon, which rebellion forces are cleaning up the aftermath of the vicious and legendary space battle, and signal beacon sent from the fringe world of Bakura arrives in system seeking out the local imperial presence to request help in repelling and alien invasion.  Luke, who is still physically and emotionally recovering from his battle with the Emperor and the death of his father, Darth Vader, and Han and Leia, who are also recovering from the battle while exploring their burgeoning new romance, are assigned the duty of taking a task force to Bakura to inform them that the Empire is now longer in power and to also provide whatever assistance they can in helping the Bakurans repel the alien invaders known as the Ssi-Ruuk.  <BR><BR>After having read the original Timothy Zahn 'Thrawn' trilogy (&quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot;, and &quot;Last Command&quot;), reading &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; was a bit of a let down.  There are some good moments and good characters to this book, but too often it gets bogged down in the internal politics of the planet (which is still run by an Imperial governor) and the too much time aboard the Ssi-Ruuk ships with the unpronounceable names of the aliens.  One of the better characters introduced is Gariel Captison, a young, pretty, strong-willed politician who advocating Bakuran independence and is a potential love interest for Luke.  The Ssi-Ruuk are also formidable characters, as fierce an alien race the New Republic will face until the deadly arrival of the Yuuzhan Vong 20 years later.  In addition to territorial cravings, the Ssi-Ruuk also seek to enslave huge numbers of the Bakuran peopleto be used in a gruesome scientific process called 'entechment', which actually transfers the life energies of an individual from their flesh body into a droid controlled ship.  These ships are thought to be much more efficient fighters, although the people trapped within them are suffering tremendously.<BR><BR>As with most of the Star Wars novels, &quot;...Bakura&quot; has its fair share of government intrigue and conspiracy, much of which is designed to thwart the efforts by the Republic to help save Bakura.  As mentioned before, too much time is spent on the dealings of the government and that does slow the book down considerably.  Yet, on the whole &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; is a good novel and provides some insight into characters, places, and events that will have a major impact on the Star Wars Universe in years to come.	2003-10-03

Ambrose has made quite a career out of his historical writings.  Viewed to be one of the most, if the most, pre-eminent World War II historians, Ambrose has written many captivating accounts of the brave men who have taken up arms in defense of this country and freedom.  He has also chronicled some of lesser-detailed, though quite famous, events in U.S. history, such as the building of the transcontinental railroad, the journey of Lewis and Clark, and the parallel lives of General Custer and Crazy Horse until their fateful meeting at Little Big Horn.  What is common in Ambrose' writing, and what makes the stories so compelling and accessible to average reader, is that he understands the importance of the human emotions and common bonds produced by the strong friendships of the men whose lives are immortalized in history.  His seminal work, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is THE classic example of this. <BR><BR>Ambrose has chronicled these male friendships in many of his books, but has felt the need to extract some of these stories and have them stand alone in a separate volume on the strength and importance of male friendships.  The result is &quot;Comrades&quot;, a sometimes slow, but mostly compelling anthology of the power of male friendships that took place in form of fathers, sons, brothers, and colleagues for famous historical figures.  &quot;Comrades&quot; is a relatively short book, with each chapter dedicating just a brief synopsis of these friendships.  However, they serve as a primer that makes the reader want to dive deeper in the stories behind these men.  One can read the short about the relationship between General Dwight Eisenhower and his brother Milton, an academic man who was his closest confidante, advisor, champion, and friend and be compelled to flesh out the relationship further by reading the Eisenhower biography.  The stories about the Custer Brothers and of Crazy Horse and He Dog merely whet the appetite for the stories thatpermeate &quot;Crazy Horse and Custer&quot;.  The same can be said for Meriweather Clark and William Clark and &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;.<BR><BR>It could be argued that a book like &quot;Comrades&quot; is nothing more than a marketing gimmick to get people to buy other Stephen Ambrose books.  That is a shortsighted and cynical interpretation.  &quot;Comrades&quot; is a wonderful primer that makes these stories accessible to the common reader and if it spurs them to seek out other books about these same subjects, then that is just a testament to the power of these stories and skill of Ambrose' writing.	2003-10-02

Some view it as an ideological sequel, if not an actual one.  I'm not sure I agree with that, as &quot;Forever Peace&quot; is a vastly different story with different characters and a much earlier timeline.  The only similarities lie in the books respective disdain for war.  &quot;Forever Peace&quot; is not up the level of quality of &quot;Forever War&quot;, but it is still a good book. <BR><BR>The story of &quot;Forever Peace&quot; centers on a full-time college professor and part-time combat soldier named Julian Class.  Julian is part of a new breed of soldier that doesn't physically fight the battles themselves.  Through robotic and biological advancements that bear many similarities to the methods used in the &quot;Matrix&quot; movies, soldiers are now operators whose minds are 'plugged-in' to the warrior-robot machines (called 'Soldierboys') they control and the platoon members they control these robots with.  While not putting the soldiers in any imminent physical danger, the control of the Soldierboys does bring about the high risk of mental and emotional wounds.  These Soldierboys are used primarily to put down uprisings in Third World countries.  These uprisings are caused primarily by conflicts over control of a technology called nanoforges, which are machines capable of designing and creating almost any physical product necessary for survival and prosperity.  In the midst of the strife caused by uprisings, there is also the planned unveiling of the most ambitious and massive scientific experiment ever conceived.  A superconductor designed around Jupiter's moons is set to be activated so that scientists can create and observe the exact conditions of the Universe's creation at its earliest possible moment.  Julian is attached to both of these major events and his actions will play a major role in determining their outcome and future impact.  There is a danger from the continued uprisings that can only be resolved by implementation of a plan based on the Soldierboy technology that can make Earth a peaceful place indefinitely.  The other danger exists in the form of a governmental and religious conspiracy that goes all the way to the stop is hell-bent on concealing evidence that shows that the superconductor experiment may be dangerous enough to threaten the galaxy's existence.  The race is on to see if these threats can be defused and Julian holds the key to them both.  <BR><BR>Conspiracy theories, fatalistic prophecies, not to mention, overt sexual themes, are common elements of Haldeman's &quot;Forever...&quot; series.  They are as prevalent as ever in &quot;Forever Peace&quot;.  Julian is an empathetic character whose own breakdowns and relations with his female academic colleague are full of the tension and sensuality readers come to expect from Haldeman.  The threat and danger of the government conspiracy to conceal the truth about the superconductor project is well written and full of suspense. While I don't feel that Julian is quite as compelling a character as William Mandella from &quot;Forever War&quot; or that his relationship is quite as touching, he still brings a strong presence to the table.  Overall, &quot;Forever Peace&quot; is a good book.  I don't think it is quite worthy of Nebula and Hugo awards (which it did win, but its not nearly the quality of other winners like &quot;Forever War&quot;, &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;), it is still a valuable piece of science fiction and worth spending the time to get to know.	2003-10-02

Aside from Boba Fett, the rest of these bounty hunters are only peripherally known from the brief scene aboard Darth Vader's Star Destroyer in &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; where Vader commissioned the bounty hunters to hunt down the Millennium Falcon (no disintegrations!)  Each of the 5 tales adds to the richness of the Star Wars Universe.<br /><br />The two best tales, in my estimation, are the ones dealing with IG-88, the droid assassin, and Zuckuss and 4-Lom, bounty hunter partners.  IG-88's story goes back to his origins and reveals the creation of his brutal killer ways.  The viciousness of this bounty hunter and the terror he imbues into his targets is palpable.  He's as formidable an assassin and bounty hunter as one is likely to find.  His story is quite compelling.  Zuckuss and 4-Lom could almost seem like an Abbott and Costello bounty hunter team.  Zuckuss is a Gand and 4-Lom is a droid.  Their adventures and bickering during and after the Battle of Hoth end up leading to an unexpected destination and destiny.<br /><br />Not all 'Tales' books are created equal.  Some are decidedly lackluster.  Fortunately, where &quot;Tales of the Bounty Hunters&quot; is concerned, there is no such problem like that here.	2003-10-02

It is not a bad book and, therefore, still worthy of a three-star rating, but it ultimately feels disjointed and rambling.  There's an intangible piece to \\"The Conquerors\\" that seems to be missing.  In the final chapter, when Beschloss summarizes the final decisions and events that took place in the aftermath of World War II, one can't help but think that these summaries don't seem to be relevant to the rest of the text in the book.  <BR><BR>The bulk of \\"The Conquerors\\" focuses on the relationship between President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau.  Morgenthau was a long time friend and confidant of the President from his pre-White House days.  Morgenthau, though Jewish by heritage, was anything but an ardent Jew.  During the era he grew up in, Jewish-ness was something to try and conceal or deny.  Morgenthau did so by proclaiming himself to be \\"100% American\\".  Yet, when word of the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime against the European Jews began to make its way around the world, that news, along with guilt and pressure applied by prominent American Jews, prompted Morgenthau to do an about-face and embrace his Jewish heritage and seek strong retribution against Germany for their actions.  His \\"Morgenthau Plan\\" called for the destruction of all German industry, which would regress the country to an agrarian state where its existence would be dependent strictly on its farming ability.  While many in the Roosevelt administration (Roosevelt included) favored harsh penalties against Germany, the \\"Morgenthau Plan\\" created an uproar and caused somewhat of an embarrassment to the administration.  The administration had to consider the practicality of such a plan given the predicted struggle with Russia over German territory and also didn't want to seem to be kowtowing to issues important only to the Jewish population, which was still viewed as 'persona non grata' at the time.  <BR><BR>\\"The Conquerors\\" also spends a great deal of time reveling in the political games that Roosevelt played within his own administration and forced to use with his other Big 3 allies, Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin.  He teamed with Stalin to goad Churchill into supporting stronger retribution against Germany, while he (and Truman) teamed with Churchill to plan ways to mute the Russian grab for land and influence in postwar Europe because they foresaw the potential chilling of relations with the Soviet Union.  The political games are fascinating and they tie back into the furor over the Morgenthau plan on some level.  However, the overall problem seems to be that there is no focus for all the disjointed anecdotes that Beschloss writes about.  As mentioned earlier, the conclusions that Beschloss arrives at in his book seem to have very little to do with his previous narrative.  While the information revealed throughout the book is intriguing, the overall quality is disappointing.  Still, it is worth a look.	2003-09-26

All subsequent movies, book, and television shows based on robots or containing robotic characters find their foundation in author Isaac Asimovs I, Robot.  This book contains 9 interconnected stories that follow the evolution of the robot from nothing more than a glorified play toy to an advanced, complex machine that is indistinguishable from humans and capable of ruling the world.  Each story adds its own distinct link the robotic evolutionary tale, and many of them include the humorous subplot of two skilled, but hapless, robot operators who seem to be the lot made to suffer for the growing pains of the robots.  The most remarkable aspect of I, Robot is the establishment of the immutable Three Laws of Robotics: <BR><BR>1.) A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. <BR><BR>2.) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. <BR><BR>3.) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First and Second Laws. <BR><BR>Throughout popular media in the past half-century you can clear examples where these laws influenced the development of robotic characters.  The characters of Bishop in the movie Aliens and Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation are the two most notable examples.<BR><BR>I, Robot soars through its narrative, creating a fast and enjoyable read.  The last tale is the only area where the book starts to lag a little bit.  Yet, the strength of the previous eight stories more than compensates.  I, Robot is a seminal work of science fiction writing that must be read by all who profess the love the genre and even those who are merely curious about the subject.	2003-09-26
US	52044836	R17JPU1AQGVNKQ	0440304245	477593969	American Caesar	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Spectacular account of a complex and remarkable man.	In the annals of American and Military history, there are few men who are more complex, enigmatic, fascinating, and terrifying than General Douglas MacArthur.  The General, as preferred everyone (including his wife) to call him, is well known for his heroics during World War II in the Pacific Theater and for his ignoble firing by President Harry Truman during the Korean War.  Many people are familiar with some of his famous quotes (I shall return) and his regal bearing.  Yet, the typical scholastic history books and the majority of historians merely gloss over the details of MacArthur and just seek to present him from a distant point of view.  MacArthur, himself, through his own memoirs, presented his life through his own rose-filtered perspective.  Author William Manchester (The Last Lion) sought a more ambitious goal.  He cut through the gloss, the pomp, and preconceived notions to produce what is, without a doubt, the definitive work about the life of General Douglas MacArthur, called American Caesar.  <BR><BR>The books title provides an interesting insight in the character of the man who would fascinate and confound generals, presidents, and the public alike.  As much as Julius Caesar was a great man who had an unwavering belief in his own destiny for greatness, so to was General MacArthur.  The grandson of a nationally respected jurist, the son of a Civil War hero, MacArthurs destiny would seem to be preordained.  Yet, let it not be said that he achieved all he did by any other means than hard work, perseverance, unshakable faith, and the occasional scathing letter from his mother.  A graduate of West Point at the turn of the century, he had already achieved the rank of brigadier general during World War I (he achieved flag rank after less than 15 years in the service).  Unlike many of the generals who directed the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War I, MacArthur felt he should fight alongside his soldiers instead of safely planning strategy in a chateau far behind the line.  This did not endear him to the other generals, but it did make him much beloved among the soldiers.  His bravery garnered him 5 Distinguished Service Crosses and spurred many a man to greater feats of accomplishment during the battles they fought.  After the war, he preserved his wartime rank of brigadier general by becoming the superintendent of the West Point and making into a more modern academic institution (in addition to its military functions).  He went on to become one of the youngest Army Chiefs of Staff and had long since achieved his forth star prior to becoming the Philippines military governor in the late 1930s.  His exploits in World War II are quite well known, as is his failure in Korea.  MacArthur craved the action and would never run from a fight.  Even when the Japanese where bombing Corrigedor and with snipers still a threat when the Allies reclaimed the Philippines, the General insisted on being out in front in the midst of the danger with his men.  <BR><BR>William Manchesters prose captures the greatness of this man while also deconstructing the motivations that drove him.  He reveals how the vanity and paranoia that eventually brought MacArthurs downfall also powered him to achieve incredible things.  American Caesar is an extraordinarily long book, coming in at just over 850 pages.  Yet, not for one single moment does the book lag.  Manchester intersperses wonderful anecdotes with the stellar chronology of this mans life.  One shows how unyielding he was in dealing with the bonus marchers during their infamous 1932 eviction from Washington, while at the same time, this four-star general in his 50s kept a clandestine affair secret, lest he would have to fast the withering glare of his mother.  Manchester weaves wonderful accounts of how MacArthur faced the vicious Japanese invasion of the Philippine in 1942 while still finding time to dote on his young son.  The author does not take sides in the controversy over the kind of man MacArthur was.  He merely presents the man as he was, warts and glory.  Its the readers task to make their own opinion of General MacArthur.  Reading American Caesar makes that task quite enjoyable.	2003-09-24

At the time of the book's release, Senator Kerrey was entertaining presidential aspirations and, while Kerrey does not admit to this, \\"When I Was a Young Man\\" is another in a long line of political memoirs released to coincide with higher political ambitions.  The greater purpose, though, stated by Kerrey and obvious from reading this book, is to bring perspective to the Vietnam War and, in particular, an incident where Kerrey is today being unjustly attacked as a war criminal.  <BR><BR>Kerrey was, without a doubt, the accidental soldier and the accidental war hero.  All Kerrey wished to do was live a simple life in Nebraska and work towards becoming a pharmacist.  The Vietnam War and prospect of being drafted led Kerrey opting, instead to go to Navy Officer Candidate School and accepting an offer to join the Navy Seals.  While not truly understanding the purpose of the war or the growing national resentment towards, Kerrey set out to perform his duty to the best of his abilities.  This led to the two most significant moments in his life.  The first is the one he is being skewered for today.  During a mission that turned out to be an abject failure, Kerrey's squad got trapped in a firefight in a Vietnamese village in which numerous women and children were killed.  Kerrey doesn't shy away from the burden of responsibility.  He fully accepts it, but in reading his description of what happened, it becomes clear to the reader that the actions of modern-day revisionists to group Kerrey with people like Lieutenant William Calley is criminal.  <BR> <BR>The second significant moment is the one for which Kerrey was awarded the highest military honor, the Congressional Medal of Honor.  By Kerrey's own admission, however, he is still not certain why he received it.  His actions in another engagement, which cost him part of one leg, may have very well saved the lives of many of his men.  Kerrey spends little time talking about the mission, itself.  It leaves the reader confused as to what actually happened that got Kerrey the Medal of Honor.  I feel that may be intentional because it seems that Kerrey, himself, is confused as to what actually happened that night, too.  He does not personally feel worthy of the award, but is persuaded to accept, if only to honor those he served with.  <BR><BR>The juxtaposition of war criminal with war hero is both fascinating and telling.  Kerrey's own personal saga probably more than anything else encompasses the mess that was the Vietnam War.  He is not that callous war criminal that some would make him out to be, nor does he feel that he is a hero that official record claims him as.  He is somewhere in between.  He is a flawed man who wanted nothing more than to do his duty and serve his country.  The horror of this tragic war put in the most unenviable of situations.  There is no greater metaphor for what the Vietnam War was than \\"When I Was a Young Man\\".	2003-09-03

Not only did define a whole new storytelling theme (the real time plot developments of the day each hour in each episode), but it also provided some of the most compelling action and drama to make network television.  The story of Counter-Terrorist Unit (CTU) agent Jack Bauer and his day-long quest to prevent the assassination of presidential candidate David Palmer (and protect the lives of his wife and daughter) are well known.  The effects and consequences of the events that came from this day are also relatively well known to fans of the series.  One can't help but think that there was more to the story of the first season than just what was shown on screen.  Thanks to Marc Cerasini, \\"24: Findings at CTU\\" provides the `rest of the story'.  <BR><BR>While it has become commonplace to provide sourcebooks for various popular TV shows, Cerasini departs from the regular canned diet of character bios and episode guides and provides and unique look at the events of \\"24\\".  \\"Findings at CTU\\" provides the `declassified' documents of the Congressional investigation into the events the day of the California presidential primary.  Personal backgrounds of the main characters come to the forefront, but so do the personal histories of the smallest bit players.  We find out more about Ira Gaines and Jamey Farrell.  We find out how Palmer's own staffer became intimately involved with one of his assassins.  Greater background is given to the mission that Jack went on and Palmer authorized to kill Victor Drazen, which led to Drazen seeking revenge against the two.  <BR><BR>The wealth of information available in \\"Findings at CTU\\" is considerable.  Admittedly, if one breaks it down to its basest elements, this is still an episode guide with character biographies.  Yet, the format and depth of the information provided takes it well beyond the conventional sourcebook.	2003-09-03

While he is well-known and recognized for his cogent analysis of history and current events, there is still one area of writing which he always returns to because it has a special place in his heart.  It is writing about baseball.  14 years ago, Halberstam produced one of the seminal works in baseball literature.  \\"Summer of `49\\" is one of the most well received sports books in history.  This story of the 1949 American League pennant race is one that even the youngest Red Sox or Yankees fan has hear of.  It should come as no surprise that Halberstam would have developed a close bond with many of players he interviewed for that book.  Then, it would seem logical that as Ted Williams, the legendary Red Sox slugger (and arguably the greatest hitter of all-time), was coming to the very end of his life, that Halberstam would see fit to write a fitting encomium to the life of `The Splendid Splinter'.  What he got was something that far surpassed even his original thoughts.<br /><br />Inspired by the journey of Williams' former teammates Johnny Pesky and Dom DiMaggio (and longtime Red Sox historian Dick Flavin) to visit their friend one last time, Halberstam came up with the idea for this book, \\"The Teammates\\".  Not only were DiMaggio and Pesky (along with Bobby Doerr, who was unable to make the trip) longtime teammates of Williams', they were also lifelong friends.  They were genuinely good friends who remained close long after their playing days were over.  \\"The Teammates\\" became less about Williams himself (although he was still the focal point) and more about this wondrous friendship these men shared.<br /><br />Halberstam found this friendship among the four men to be unlike anything ever witnessed in sports and, indeed, it comes across to the reader.  Halberstam bounces back and forth from accounts of the final journey to visit Williams to tales from the earliest days when Williams and Doerr first joined the Sox in the late 30's.  He recounts how they met, how their friendship blossomed, and how it endured through the years through the various successes and hardships each of them endured.  There has truly never been a friendship quite like this one, and there will likely never be one again.  That is just one factor of many that make \\"The Teammates\\" an amazing read.	2003-09-03

Certainly, there have been many attempts in the past to try and quantify to relative successes and failures of each Presidency, and there have definitely been lists of the best to worst Presidents.  In most cases, however, these attempts at rankings are nothing more than thinly-veiled, politically biased extrapolations.  People with an axe to grind against either political party would likely thrust a President from the opposition party somewhere low on the list.  Certainly, there have been many attempts in the past to try and quantify to relative successes and failures of each Presidency, and there have definitely been lists of the best to worst Presidents.  In most cases, however, these attempts at rankings are nothing more than thinly-veiled, politically biased extrapolations.  People with an axe to grind against either political party would likely thrust a President from the opposition party somewhere low on the list.  William Ridings and Stuart McIver, however, make a concerted effort to present as objective a set of criteria as possible for rating the presidents, as well as consulting the least subjective sources for the material and evidence to support the ratings.  What results is a relatively fair and balanced assessment of where each Presidency finds itself in the harsh glare of history.  There are few surprises with Abraham Lincoln being rated #1 and Warren G. Harding being rated the worst, but people might be surprised to find that Bill Clinton not rated as badly as some would think, while John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan aren't rated as highly as one would assume.  The ratings might seem debatable, and they may very well provoke debate, but when one sits down to assess them, they will realize that this books provides a fair judgment of all of our Commanders-in-Chief.	2003-09-03

While Card did a marvelous job chronicling the life and times of Ender Wiggin in the first four novels of the `Ender's Saga', and richly enhanced that universe with his subsequent three-book \\"Ender's Shadow\\" series, one could not help but think that there might be more than need be told.  Enter \\"First Meetings in the Enderverse\\", an anthology of four short stories that give even greater insight into Ender's world.  <BR><BR>One of the four short stories included in \\"First Meetings...\\" is the actual original \\"Ender's Game\\" short story.  Card wrote this in the mid-1970's and expanded it into the award-winning novel everyone knows in the early to mid-1980's.  Here, fans of \\"Ender's Game\\" can read Card's original vision and appreciate how the full novel came to be.  The other three shorts tell some fascinating tales.  The first one deals with the life of Ender's father, John Paul Wiggin, when he was a little kid, not much older than Ender at the time of \\"Ender's Game\\".  Without revealing too much, here, it can be said that the events of young John Paul's life explain a great deal about what came to pass for Ender a generation later.  The second tale advances John Paul to college age and reveals how John Paul and Ender's mother, Theresa, came to meet and fall in love.  The final tale (after the original \\"Ender's Game\\") bridges a period of time between the ending of \\"Ender's Game\\" and its amazing sequel \\"Speaker for the Dead\\".  The mystery of how Ender and his constant virtual companion, Jane, came into each other's lives is explained and it makes for an amusing anecdote.  <BR><BR>Once again, Card continues to show a brilliant grasp of human emotion and personal interactions in bringing these shorts to life.  He doesn't get bogged down in the existentialism that plagued \\"Children of the Mind\\".  He sticks with elements that make this saga great.	2003-09-03
US	52044836	RSCIXY1OXQACF	1556520654	725032132	Level 7	Books	5	38	38	N	N	As gripping a tale of nuclear holocaust as any.	Nuclear war is both a fascinating and a terrifying topic for literature.  One of the most famous, and affecting, pieces of literature ever written about the aftermath of a nuclear war is \\"On the Beach\\" by Nevil Shute.  The terror and hopelessness the citizens of Australia feel as the deadly radioactive cloud slowly and inevitably moves towards their continent is palpable and harrowing to read.  During the same period that Shute wrote \\"On the Beach\\", another noted author, Mordecai Roshwald, wrote an equally compelling novel about the preparations and aftermath of nuclear war, called \\"Level 7\\".  <BR><BR>\\"Level 7\\" is a reference to the deepest level of underground shelters that humanity will be sequestered in should this horrible kind of war come to pass.  The perceived importance of the people housed in the respective levels increases with each successive level.  Level 1 is simply ordinary citizens who will receive minimal shielding from the bombs.  Level 5 has the government and military planners, while Level 6 houses the soldiers who will be in charge of defensive countermeasures during the war, and Level 7 houses those whose horrific (and one-time) task will be to fire the offensive nuclear missiles at the enemy.  Level 7 is several thousand feet underground.  It is seemingly impervious to the effects of a nuclear attack and is a self-sufficient living environment designed to sustain the survivors (and their offspring) until such time as the surface becomes safe to return to.  Those selected for the Level 7 assignment have passed a rigorous set of psychological tests that require said soldiers to not be afraid of firing missiles that can end mankind, to not be concerned with being cut off from humanity, and to be prepared to do what is necessary to ensure humanity's survival.  <BR><BR>The story of \\"Level 7\\" is told in journal form from the perspective of one of the soldiers tasked with firing those awful weapons.  He is only referred to by his operating number andhis view of events is, to say the least, unique.  He doesn't seem to be particularly bothered by his assignment to Level 7.  His description of entering the level through one-way doors through which there is no return is so calm and disaffected that the prospect of such a terminable existence seems even more terrifying to the reader than if he was panicky.  When the time for the war comes, he doesn't seem particularly bothered about the fact that he has to push one button to launch several offensive weapons and then his usefulness is complete (save for perpetuating the species).  He views with pity the fate of one of his fellow soldiers who goes absolutely insane when faced with the prospect of having to fire the missiles that may wipe out humanity.  In relatively short order, the war begins and in ends.  All that is left is to assess the damage to wait for the day when it is safe to return.  <BR><BR>Alas, even the best laid plans like this multi-tiered shelter fall victim to the merciless tendencies of war and nature.  The top most levels are either wiped out instantly during the attacks or poisoned almost immediately by radiation.  While the former warring countries come to terms of peace (via radio, obviously), the effects of the war continue to wipe out one level after another.  The horrifying realization begins to settle in that no one will survive this war.  Much like \\"On the Beach\\", \\"Level 7\\" leaves to reader with the sad image that after death, there will be no more life.	2003-09-03

He currently has three separate books on the market about golf.  \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" deals with the vast cross-section of PGA Tour players from the `grinders' who can barely make the tour to the elite who win the major tournaments.  Feinstein's most recent book, \\"Open\\" focuses on the notable 2002 U.S. Open tournament held at New York's Bethpage Black public golf course.  In between these broad and narrow manifestos, Feinstein finds a middle ground in his book, \\"The Majors\\".  \\"The Majors\\" follows a similar approach to \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\", but narrative focus is narrowed to only deal with the four `major' tournaments: The Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship.  Instead of focusing on all the golfers who play on the tour, Feinstein cares about those are legitimate contenders for the majors and the pressures they endure in pursuit of golf's Holy Grail.<br /><br />The season in question is the 1998 PGA Tour season.  This is just one year after Tiger Woods burst on to the scene with his shocking domination of the 1997 Masters.  In the interim, Tiger-mania has faded as has Woods' performance.  1998 is less about Tiger and more about men who have long battled for these trophies, but had, so far, failed to attain them.  It is ironic that Tiger's good friends, Mark O'Meara actually became the big winner of 1998 with his victory in The Masters and the British Open.<br /><br />\\"The Majors\\" is quite an enjoyable read because of how it thrusts the reader in the high pressure world of big-time golf and major tournaments.  Feinstein is a gifted sportswriter and great author.  \\"The Majors\\" is just one more testament to that.	2003-09-03

Closer examination also reveals that what is inside is potentially fascinating, too.  Thanks to a brief window granted by the Freedom of Information Act, author Douglas Keeney was able to get his hands on a copy of the 1958 version of the U.S. Government's Emergency Plans Book.  This book was the definitive study on impact of a nuclear attack on the United States.  It focuses on the prelude, the actual attack, and the aftermath.  It's fascinating and scary to see what our 'Cold Warriors' feared might be the end result of such a war.  This manual predicts what would happen and recommends broad approaches to handling it after the fact. <BR> Author Keeney published this manual in conjunction with his own notes regarding the manual.  In it, he expands on the points made in the manual and also uses the events of September 11th, 2001 as an example of how the U.S. eventually DID face a disastrous attack of great magnitude.  This makes for a quick and fascinating read for any who are students of the Cold War and intrigued by this subject matter.	2003-08-19

The book is essentially 360 pages of a single non-stop action sequence, interspersed with anecdotes to set up the backstory.  It is unique because it puts a female character as the protagonist (or antagonist, depending on your point of view).  Not many authors have nerve to put a woman as the lead in an action thriller.  Even fewer are willing to take the risk of making her the bad character.  It's a risky proposition, but author Pat O'Connell pulls it off fairly successfully.  <BR><BR>The book starts when disgruntled Air Force pilot, Kim Kenada, decides to use skills and security clearances to hijack a state-of-the-art fighter jet (armed with nuclear missiles) and threaten major cities along the eastern seaboard unless the U.S. government meets her ransom demands.  \\"Knight Hawk\\" follows Kenada on her mission of desperation and slowly unravels the influences that caused her to go rogue.  That is where this book excels.  Instead of just settling in for nothing but 360 pages of non-stop action which, admittedly, is pretty pulse-pounding, O'Connell breaks it up with stories that deconstruct exactly who Kim Kenada is and reveals what may motivate her.  The final motivation is not revealed until the very end and it is very surprising (so I certainly will not spoil it here), but some of the earlier stresses she endures, from false accusations that nearly ruined her career to dealing with an unfaithful husband, reveal how she may have been pushed towards the breaking point.  <BR><BR>\\"Knight Hawk\\" is merciless on a number of its characters.  Aside from the actual fighter pilots (Kenada and those sent to shoot her down), O'Connell spares no quarter in dealing with the upper military command and even the President and his administration.  The military brass, with only a couple of exceptions, is portrayed as bumbling, self-absorbed, egotistical morons.  These men were caught flat-footed when the crisis began and have done little to distinguish themselves during its execution.  The President and his staff aren't treated much better.  Instead of providing strong leadership, the President and his advisors act like sleazy backroom politicians whose only concern is how their reputations can survive this crisis and how they can turn it to political advantage.  As stated, O'Connell only seems to have some degree of respect for the actual fighter pilots.  They are treated with the most respect in the book.  His prose in describing the aerial battles is clear and concise.  His knowledge of fighter tactics and strategy is deep enough that he can accurately describe what is happening without burying the reader under mountains of technical jargon.  <BR><BR>All told, \\"Knight Hawk\\" will prove to be a very quick read.  The concept and its execution are essentially flawless.  The time a reader will spend on this novel will not be wasted.	2003-08-01

A society where everyone is equal and the government provides for all would appear to be utopian existence.  However, advocates of Communism and those responsible for its application failed to take into account one important `X-factor'... the human element.  Human nature is competitive.  It is instinctive to want to gain an edge and make one's self better, and to have control over one's own destiny.  That's why, on paper, Communism works, but in practice, it failed miserably.  The Soviet Union from 1917 to 1991 (from the Bolshevik Revolution to the collapse of the USSR) was the glaring example of the worst application of this form of government.  Everyone being equal and dependent on the government meant that a few unscrupulous individuals could corrupt the system for their own gains and at the expense of the people.  Josef Stalin reign of terror over the Soviet Union is the most atrocious occurrence of this.<br /><br />This little history lesson is necessary to provide to background to and understand the inspiration for George Orwell's masterpiece, \\"Animal Farm\\".  Orwell, himself was an advocate of pure Socialism (which has many similarities to Communism).  However, during his involvement during the Spanish Civil War (I believe that was the name of this conflict) in 1937, he learned how this system could be perverted when Stalin-supported Socialists took partial control of Spain's government and began suppressing opposition in terrifying ways.  During the 1940's when the world was at war with Germany and enamored with the Soviet Union (because of they were exacting sufficient damage upon the German war machine), Orwell wrote \\"Animal Farm\\" as a parable of the best intentions of the rebellion gone awry.<br /><br />\\"Animal Farm\\" focuses on the rebellion of a group of farm animals who grew tired of the perceived mistreatment at the hands of their master, Farmer Jones.  Inspired by an idealistic colleague and prodded by a few unscrupulous pigs, the animals revolted and took control of farm.  Once the farm was in animal control, the two lead pigs, Napoleon and Snowball took command of the farm and set about establishing a society where the animals were responsible for their own well being and beholden to no one else.  Alas, petty jealousies, scandalous activities, and gross manipulation of the minds and emotions of the lesser animals lead to the new society being just as bad, or worse, than the previous one.  The famed line in book becomes \\"All animals are created equal.  But, some animals are more equal than others\\".<br /><br />It's impossible to read this book and not see the very graphic parallels between the Animal Farm and Stalinist Russia.  In each case, the peasants (or lesser animals) were goaded into rebellion to throw off leaders that were perceived to be oppressive.  The respective rebellions were bathed in romanticism and idealism.  Yet, in each case, the new society that grew out of the rebellions proved to be worse than the one that preceded it.  The pig Napoleon is seen as the representation of Josef Stalin.  Most of the other animals are representations of the terrified populace of the Soviet Union which suffered under Stalin, but was either too scared or too ignorant to stand up for themselves.<br /><br />\\"Animal Farm\\" finds itself as a regular institution on many high school reading lists.  That should not dissuade adults from picking up this novel.  It is as relevant a cautionary tale today as it was more than half a century earlier.d by an idealistic colleague and prodded by a few unscrupulous pigs, the animals revolted and took control of farm.

US	52044836	R3JWZMOLA5S7VR	075093185X	165857334	The Flight of Rudolf Hess: Myths and Reality	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Provides a quality, if brief, primer about this WW2 mystery	\\"The Flight of Rudolf Hess\\" has its fair share of ups and downs in its coverage of the bizarre flight of Hitler's Deputy Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, to Scotland under the pretenses of negotiating a peace treaty.  The authors seek to present the facts pertaining to the flight, while also dealing directly with a number of conspiracy theories pertaining to this event.  For those who are unfamiliar with Hess and his actions, \\"The Flight...\\" gives a brief summary of his life up until the day of the flight.  It reveals that he was decorated World War I veteran who was crushed by the condition of Germany after the war.  It shows a man who allied himself, fanatically so, with a man he felt could restore Germany to its former greatness.  It shows that, despite his own personal revulsion over the Third Reich's Jewish policies, Hess was as dedicated and loyal a supporter to Hitler as any.  He was, at one point, first in the order of succession should Hitler meet his demise.  Alas, his mental instability (a seeming common affliction among most of Hitler's top aides) and his insistence on being able to be fighter pilot in World War II(despite his importance in the government) caused Hess to be demoted in the grand scheme of things.  He was dropped to second in the line of succession behind Herman Goering and had many of his responsibilities co-opted by Martin Bormann.  <BR><BR>The background provided of Rudolf Hess gives one a good idea of the mindset of the man and what may have caused him to make the flight.  \\"The Flight...\\" explores Hess' motivations and the degree of knowledge within German circles of Hess' intent to go on this mission.   When focusing on the motivations and political intrigue that played a role in this event, this book is at its best.  Getting inside the mind of Hess and inside the inner circle of the German High Command is both compelling and educational.  The areas where this book falters, and why it only garners a 3-star rating, are where the authors choose toexpand on minute details pertaining to the flight.  There's an entire chapter focusing strictly on what kind of plane it was that Hess flew and why it couldn't have been any other type.  While this information may be of some value to people who covet the technical details of all military machinery, it doesn't really fit the overall theme of this book, which is to construct the factual basis for this flight while also debunking the myths surrounding it.  <BR><BR>At 133 pages, plus indices, it's a quick read and definitely worth a look.  World War II is one of the most compelling historical topics for history buffs and the casual reader alike.  \\"The Flight of Rudolf Hess\\" is a good addition to the annals of that war.	2003-06-11

In the previous New Jedi Order novel, \\"Destiny's Way\\", the Galactic Alliance (nee' New Republic) earned its first major victory against the Yuuzhan Vong in this horrific, genocidal war.  With peripheral assistance from the Imperial Remnant and a brilliant plan devised by the legendary Admiral Ackbar, the Alliance eschewed using a dangerous biological weapon in favor of a carefully devised conventional warfare trap.  As a result, a huge Vong strike force, led by the evil Warmaster Tsavong Lah, was wiped out in the vicious battle of Ebaq 9.  The casualties included Lah's own death and the reputation of executor Nom Anor, who championed the assault in the first place.  These events, at the conclusion of \\"Destiny's Way\\" gave hope to the Star Wars reader that it may actually be possible to win this war against the Yuuzhan Vong.  <BR><BR>\\"Remnant\\" the first book of the \\"Force Heretic Trilogy\\" continues the progress of its predecessor while still reminding the reader, in horrifying fashion, of the monumental threat still posed by the Vong.  Now that the Vong have taking over the galactic homeworld of Coruscant, among numerous other planets, and have recently suffered the devastating loss at Ebaq 9, the alien invaders have decided hold steady and regroup.  Only on a few occasions is a strike force sent on an offensive mission.  Those missions, however, are not for occupation or conversion.  They are for complete annihilation.  Using slave ship technology, the Vong capture between thousands to millions of 'slaves' while leaving the planets in smoldering ruins.  In the midst of a diplomatic mission to strengthen ties with the Imperial Remnant, the Jedi encounter the latest Vong annihilation strike, aimed at the Imperial core world of Bastion.  <BR><BR>\\"Remnant\\" focuses on a two-pronged mission by the Alliance and Jedi to reconstruct the infrastructure that will be necessary for governing the post-war galaxy and to search for a mythical 'living' planet called Zonama Sekot thatmay hold the key to ending this war.  This is easily one of the more enjoyable New Jedi Order novels in terms of subject matter.  It continues develop the relationships with Imperial Remnant and Grand Admiral Pealleon (an underground fan favorite in my mind).  It also spends some time growing evolution of Jaina and Jacen Solo in mature young adults and their relations with others, Jag Fel and Danni Quee to name a few.  There is also a great deal of exposition of the Yuuzhan Vong Shamed One's heretic underground.  This form of heresy, which Nom Anor had sworn to eradicate, provides the means by which he can continue to survive following his failure in the previous novel. <BR><BR>The only negative aspect of this book is the author's seeming unwillingness to use a chapter structure to the book.  \\"Remnant\\" is broken down into just four large sections that, over the course of 400 pages, can be quite ponderous.  There are a number of breaks throughout the sections, but no real chapter breaks.  The previous time this technique was used was in \\"Shield of Lies\\" the second book of the Black Fleet Crisis series.  That was an unmitigated failure.  It's a risk to use this type of format, and it can only be successful if the subject matter is worthwhile.  Fortunately with \\"Remnant\\" it is.	2003-05-29

It seemed that, despite developing a greater understanding of the Vong and their technology, all the Jedi and/or New Republic were able to do was gain a few minor, pyrrhic victories.  A few books earlier, the horror of the falling the of galactic capital, Coruscant, and the suddenness of the death of Anakin Solo drove home exactly how futile this war had become.  Would there be any chance that the tide could possibly turn in the favor of the good guys?  With the return of Jacen Solo from his horrific captivity at the hands of the Yuuzhan Vong, the answer is definitely 'Yes!'.  <BR><BR>\\"Destiny's Way\\" is the first novel that really gives hope to the Star Wars reader that there may be a chance to win this genocidal war.  Also, instead of relying on stock situations that have become prevalent throughout the NJO series, \\"Destiny's Way\\" focuses on areas of political intrigue and personal relationships that have been left untouched in recent novels.  For starters, what was the New Republic has regrouped on the planet Mon Calamari and have begun to set plans in motion for the structure of a post-war government, should they be fortunate to survive to that point.  The idea being that the very bureaucracies that doomed the New Republic (and its predecessor for that matter) to failure should not be repeated this time around.  Embracing the New Jedi Order, putting less power with the bureaucrats who impede the government, and the encompassing of the galaxy as a whole ruling body are the key elements of the new Galactic Alliance.  The political intrigue that goes into to the development of this government is the some of the best to be committed to the pages of the Star Wars universe since the days of then-Senator Borsk Fey'lya's power plays against the administration of Mon Mothma.  <BR><BR>Intrigue doesn't just take place in Galactic Alliance, though.  Among the Yuuzhan Vong, infamous executor Nom Anor uses all of his political skills to save face in the midst of his failure with Jacen Solo.  The growing reverence among the Shamed Ones caste of the 'jeedai' beginning to be perceived as a heresy that threatens the very existence of the Vong, as well.  In addition, there is inter-governmental intrigue between the Alliance and the Imperial Remnant, where the Alliance is trying to impress upon the Remnant the need for them to get involved in the war with the Vong.  It's really nice to see the Empire back in the picture again, and it is even more welcome that Grand Admiral Pealleon has returned to the fold.  On top of the politics, its even more appreciated that a greater focus is being returned to certain personal relationships: Jaina Solo with Jag Fel, and Jacen Solo with just about everybody following his return, to name a few.  <BR><BR>All of these elements, along with the best space battle to visit this series since the final battle of \\"Vector Prime\\", are what make \\"Destiny's Way\\" one of the truly stellar novels in the New Jedi Order.  Knowing that only five more books will follow before this series comes to a conclusion, its refreshing to see it stop stagnating and start heading in new directions.	2003-05-28
US	52044836	R1ILB5TISYBVNE	0375756787	693970523	The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt (Modern Library Paperbacks)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Epic biography of one of the truly great men in U.S. History	Certainly Theodore Roosevelt is one of the best known Presidents and best known men in history of the United States.  His exploits as a frontiersman, his courage in leading the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War, and his storied achievements as a career politician (from state assemblyman all the way up to President) are all well known.  However, most of what people know about 'T.R.' is limited to sound bite quality historical facts.  It's not a common occurrence for people to invest the time in reading any number of lengthy and ponderous biographies about Roosevelt.  It is important to do so, though, to understand the man and the best way to accomplish that is to read Edmund Morris' sweeping epic \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\".  <BR><BR>These days, Morris may be better known for his the controversy created by his pseudo-biography of Ronald Reagan, \\"Dutch\\".  Questionable though his literary choice may have been in that instance, lest anyone forget that Morris is a gifted, respected, and accomplished writer.  \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" is the first in planned trilogy about the life of the famous 'Bull Moose' (\\"Theodore Rex\\" deals with his years as President and the third book has yet to be published).  \\"The Rise...\\" gives the reader an intimate look into life of T.R.  Culled from public records and private diaries and correspondences, this book focuses as much of the 'why' of Roosevelt's actions as the 'what'.  <BR><BR>In \\"The Rise...\\", one learns that it was the horrible experience of his father's attempt to be confirmed for New York collections commissioner (a strenuous experience that may have led to the elder's death) that formed the basis of Theodore's hatred of 'machine' politics and his lifelong dedication to Civil Service and political reform.  His famed political battles throughout his life can be traced back to the trauma of that experience and Morris does well to capture the emotion and impact that had on T.R.  Teddy's relationship with his father is explored deeply in the earlier chapters and reveals a lot of what made him the man he became.  As he was burdened with ill-health as a youngster, his father frequently took him into the wilderness and open country to improve his health.  It was there that Teddy's health improved and a fierce love of the outdoors began.  It was a love that manifested itself in years of annual trips out west to hunt, farm, and cultivate the outdoors.  Much of what he learned from this led Roosevelt to become the staunch conservationist who was responsible for much of the legislation protecting national wildlife. In addition the exposure to the wild, Roosevelt's father also impressed upon him the importance of a classical education and, as a result, T.R. became a voracious reader with an appetite for any and all knowledge. <BR><BR>Those are just a few examples from the early of life of Roosevelt that Morris recreates so vividly.  Other areas filled with greater depth than in other books included Roosevelt's first marriage to Alice Lee and the traumatic effect her sudden death had on him.  It also highlights the various highs and lows Roosevelt encountered throughout his storied, pre-Presidential political career.  Registering at just under 800 pages, \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" is an amazing biography and well worth the time invested to read.  Few books can transcend the typical fact-based monotony of most biographies of long-dead historical figures.  Yet, \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\", dealing strictly with his years before becoming President, is just such a transcendent book.	2003-05-14

In the aftermath of the Bugger War, humanity's hero, Ender Wiggin, bore the burden of Earth's shame at committing the xenocide of an alien race.  Unable to return to Earth, Ender left with beloved sister, Valentine, for one of the new colony worlds (made available by the extinction of the Buggers).  It was there that he realized that he had an almost supernatural connection and understanding of the Buggers.  Despite his role in the destruction of their species, they entrusted him with the sole remaining larval queen of the species and gave him the responsibility of restarting the race when the time was right.  Ender's new enlightenment led him to write a famous treatise on this species called \\"Speaker of the Dead for the Hive Queen\\".  In it, he told the true story about the Buggers in such a frank and honest manner that it created a sensation on Earth.  Suddenly, humans could empathize with their former enemies and understand the fallacy of having destroyed them.  Ender's work created a demand for him to be a 'speaker for the dead' of many more people.  The sensation caused by Ender's writings created an entire movement of literary thought and a near army of 'Speakers for the Dead'.  As Ender was too restless to stay in one place very long, he traveled to many different worlds and, as a result of time distortions due to space travel, actually was still relatively young some 3000 years after his 'Speaker' movement began.  It was now an accepted part of human culture and frequently called upon when people died.  It helped all gain and understanding and, perhaps (but not necessarily), give closure.  Ender and Valentine finally found a world to settle on for the rest of their lives and seemed content, until one day, a desperate call for a 'speaker' came from a distraught child on the nearby colony world of Lusitania.  So begins the amazing story that powers \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" <BR><BR>Ender travels to Lusitania first to respond to the pleas of a young girl whose lifewas torn asunder by the heroic deaths of her parents.  Her parents were able to find a treatment for a vicious contagion that threatened to kill all human life on Lusitania, but were unfortunately unable to save themselves.  In the 30-year window of Ender's space travel (which was merely a few weeks to him), this little girl has grown up and started a family, but it's a family that is mired in tremendous strife as the burdens of the past still weigh upon the children of the present.  All this happens among the ongoing interaction with a semi-intelligent species of indigenous life called 'piggies'.  Understanding them, while still being restrained by archaic colonial policy, leads to much discord among the colony members.  <BR><BR>\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is Orson Scott Card's sequel the famous and award-winning \\"Ender's Game\\".  Those who are expecting the just a rehash of some science-fiction scenarios first played out in \\"Ender's Game\\" will be sorely disappointed.  However, for those who loved \\"Ender's Game\\" and were able to see deep enough into the story to understand the truly important elements, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" will be an amazing read.  One must understand that the science-fiction elements to Card's books are just the skin to the entire body of his stories.  Card's literary power comes from his understanding of human relationships and dynamics and writing in such a way that the reader empathizes (and even sympathizes) with the characters in the books.  One cannot help by to feel a powerful emotional investment into the lives and struggles of these people.  Whereas \\"Ender's Game\\" intertwined the human relationships amid the backdrop of Battle School and the Bugger War, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is almost completely and totally about the human element.  Such a dramatic change in focus is no less compelling.  Clearly, critics felt this way about the sequel, because \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" garnered the same Hugo and Nebula Awards that \\"Ender's Game\\" did.  <BR><BR>It would be unfortunate if fans of \\"Ender's Game\\" (and they are legion) were to overlook \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" and its sequels simply because of the change in focus.  Lovers of \\"Ender's Game\\" will find that \\"Speaker...\\" is equally impossible to put down.  The human drama is so real that the reader feels like they are a part of the story.  No greater compliment can be granted to such a novel.	2003-04-30
US	52044836	R1IPKWDB3HLVW4	0765300176	582223695	Shadow Puppets (The Shadow Series)	Books	4	28	30	N	N	Satisfactory, but perfunctory, conclusion(?) to 'Bean' saga	I put a question mark next to the word conclusion in the title of this review because it's not clear if &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; is the final book in the entire 'Ender's Saga' ('Bean sub-saga').  A large number of issues are resolved in this book, but others are still left up in the air.  At the present time, there is listing or information about any future episodes in this series.  So, for the time being, I will assume this is the last book.  If it is, despite seeming loose ends, it would make a satisfactory conclusion.  <BR><BR>&quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; should probably be the end, though.  Much like the last portion of &quot;Xenocide&quot; and all of &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; in the original 'Ender's Quartet', Orson Scott Card seems to be running out of steam with these characters.  Card still displays his gifts of representing human interactions, but &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; has less ability to stand on it's own.  Unlike &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and, to a slightly lesser degree, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, you absolutely have to have read the previous books in the series for &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; to have any true meaning.  Whereas &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; were connected by similar characters, yet told different stories (much like &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;), &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; merely continues the storyline from &quot;...Hegemon&quot;. <BR><BR>To summarize, Peter Wiggin has achieved his long sought after goal of becoming the Hegemon, but the title carries little power with it in the wake of a large Chinese invasion throughout southern Asia, and subsequent assumption of the position of Earth's premier military power.  These actions were set in motion by the psychotic Achilles before his true nature came to light and he was placed under arrest by the Chinese government.  Peter sees his only true way of thwarting the Chinese and restoring prestige to the office of the Hegemon is to rescue Achilles from prison and put him to work for the Hegemony.  Think that, despite Achilles manipulative skills, he can control him, Peter mistakenly compromises his own security and drives away many of those who served him, including Bean and Petra.<BR><BR>During their self-imposed exile from Hegemon, Bean and Petra try to find ways to undermine the Chinese and Achilles while also dealing with a burgeoning romance and Petra's desire to have children by Bean before he dies of his genetic disorder.  While it is somewhat interesting to read about Bean and Petra's romance, it is still somewhat dry.  It's not impossible to conceive of this happening, as they are both probably 16 years old at this point and far older in many other ways, given what their early years consisted of.  Yet, there's not really any spark to the relationship.  It seems to the reader as if they are having this romance because they feel that it's something that they should do, not because there is any passionate romantic feelings sparking between them.  It can't carry near the same weight as the personal interactions and tender romance that took place in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;.  That example is just thrown in as a perfect representation of Card's ability to convey human emotion.  It's not quite as well-crafted here.  It's not bad, though, so the reader still has some emotional investment in these two.  <BR><BR>There are other elements of &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; that are quite interesting.  For the first time in all seven of the &quot;Ender's&quot; novels, the reader gets a chance to truly see the personalities of Theresa and John Paul Wiggins, the parents of Peter, Ender and Valentine.  A great deal of time is spent on Peter's reluctant interaction with his parents and his eventual acceptance of their advice as relevant and appreciated.  They come across as so much more than the bland, inattentive parents that readers were first introduced to in &quot;Ender's Game&quot;.  In addition, there are interactions with many other former Battle School students.  Alai and Han Tzu are just a few of the names who play major roles in the events that shape this novel.  <BR><BR>On the whole &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; was a good read.  If there are more books on the horizon, then all the better.  However, if this is where the series ends, then so be it.  It's not a bad way to go out.	2003-04-30
US	52044836	R3AVF6AGHJV5DU	0060187239	630454514	April 1865: The Month That Saved America	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	Spectacular Saga of the Civil War's last days	Author Jay Winik has managed to produced an amazing piece of historical reference with his book, \\"April 1865\\".  He is dealing with a war (Civil War) that grips the American curiosity and imagination almost as much as World War II.  However, instead of focusing on the broad scope of the entire war or the very narrow view of a specific battle, Winik tells the tale of the final month of the Civil War, where Lee surrendered to Grant, Lincoln was assassinated, and a potential reconciliation between North and South teetered on the edge of disaster.  <BR><BR>Winik's thesis about the events that causes of the war and the impact the war would have on the country is unique and quite compelling.  He posits that, despite what was seemingly accomplished at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, the United States was not truly a 'nation' as a whole.  Rather, it was simply a loose 'union' of 13 separate states that was held together by one single government.  The words 'nation' and 'union' play important roles in Winik's narrative.  Nation indicates a country that has a strong single identity that all members can identify with, whereas a union is just seen as alliance among many differing parties.  Winik points out that neither the Constitution, nor the Declaration of Independence, make any reference to the United States being a 'nation'.  All occurrences refer to it as a 'union' (witness the preamble of the Constitution which begins, \\"We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect 'Union'....\\").  He asserts that this was intentional on the parts of the founding fathers who were dealing with trying to form a central government for a land that was basically 13 separate countries.  Attempts to forge a national identity were not made and did not come to fruition until post-Civil War.  He cites numerous examples prior to South's secession in 1860 of different regions of the U.S. seeking to break off from the whole country.  The Whiskey Rebellion rebels, New England during the War of 1812, and New York City and New Jersey throughout much of the early 1800's, are just a few of the examples of portions of the U.S. that made their own attempts at secession, but were discouraged from doing so before such plans could come to fruition.  Winik contends that this lack of national identity that provoked these near crises in the early 19th century was what eventually enabled the South to secede over passionate 'states rights' issues and the divisive debate over slavery.  It is his position that United States did not start to forge its national identity until it suffered through this horrible war and needed to come together to repair the country in its aftermath.<BR><BR>With this as a premise, Winik then goes into great detail about the players and events that would shape that last days of the Civil War and shape the future of the United States.  In the waning days of the war, the country was at a major crossroads.  Robert E. Lee's battered Army of Northern Virginia was faced with imminent defeat and pondering the logic of retreating and starting a guerrilla-style war that would keep the struggle going for years more.  On the Northern side, Lincoln expressed great fear about just that type of tactic.  It was a tactic that he felt would never enable this country to recover.  Knowing that the Confederate armies were on the verge of defeat, Lincoln wanted to find the most humane way to end the war and receive the South back into the Union.  Despite his best intentions, would Lincoln be able to accomplish his goal of reconciliation and would the country as a whole be able to continue his dream following his assassination?  <BR><BR>\\"April 1865\\" explores the crucial decisions that men like Grant, Lee, Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and Sherman, had to make in the final days.  To add greater depth the men in these positions, Winik doesn't just make cursory references to the past and current state.  He actually goes deep into their backgrounds to showwhere these men came from, how they thought, and how they would view the choices that needed to be made during this time.  In a lesser author's hands, these biographical narratives would seem like nothing more than filler to pad the page total.  In \\"April 1865\\", it seems absolutely necessary for these details to be published in order to allow the reader to feel a greater sense of empathy for these men and there struggles.  Unlike some war novels, which seem to try and tell everyone's story (a very cumbersome read, to be sure), this saga focuses just on the major players mentioned above and a number of crucial smaller players whose actions would have a large impact on the countries future, like Nathan Bedford Forrest, John Mosby, and John Wilkes Booth.<BR><BR>Winik is able to transport the reader back to that fateful month with a compelling writing style that puts one right in the middle of these events.  His focused context and fascinating thesis make this a fascinating read.  \\"April 1865\\" is a mandatory requirement for any history buff's bookshelf.	2003-04-25

Lt. General (then Lt. Colonel) Hal Moore's account of the vicious battle of Ia Drang in 1965 should be a very compelling read, giving great insight to the battle that changed to scope of the Vietnam War.  Unfortunately, Moore's narrative is nothing more than series of repetitive statements and descriptions of the action that took place.  In a few of the negative (or less than enthusiastic) reviews written about this book, it has been cited that this reads more like a battle 'after-action' report than a literary presentation of the events of that day.  I have to agree.  Writing accounts of actual battles is a tricky proposition.  A good writer or editor can make it happen, though.  Neither seemed to have helped with this book.  After approximately 50 pages of relatively interesting background material to set the stage for the battle to follow, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" just dissolves into 300 pages of non-stop battle sequences.  If a proper context is given to the events that are occurring, it can allow the lay person to properly understand and picture what is taking place.  Unfortunately, it seems that Moore is intent on telling the stories of every single soldier who fought in that battle, describing their wounds and their determination to fight on.  There are far too many names to keep track of and their situations are far too similar to give the reader and distinct sense of who these men were.  There is also a very frustrating tendency to jump to different soldiers' points of views without ever giving a proper transition.  One minute, the reader may think they are reading the comments of a private who was shot and survived the battle, but the next minute it will be the company captain who is speaking, and there will have been nothing to indicate the switch in speakers.  <BR><BR>Although Hal Moore's name is listed as the primary author for this book, he really isn't the primary person at fault for the failure of \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\".  Moore is a military man, not a writer.  His skills lay in his ability to prepare men for battle and then lead them into battle, have them do their job, and get as many out safely as possible.  From all accounts, Moore was superb with this task.  The fault lies more with his editors at the publishing house and his co-author, journalist Joseph Galloway.  By trade, Galloway is a writer and he should be equipped with strong narrative and story-telling skills.  He could have and should have taken the tremendous insights that Moore provided and molded them into a fascinating tale of the men who fought on that day.  There are many non-fiction war books that have managed to accomplish this.  The editors of this book should also have seen that there was no narrative flow to the story and found ways to improve it before they published it.  Alas, they didn't and, as a result, \\"We Were Soldiers...\\" is a chore to read.  <BR><BR>It is clear that I am in the minority in my opinion here.  That is part of why I feel it pains me to give this book a negative review.  However, my final decision came down to a set of deciding factors:  As a person who reads a lot of military history, but has never been in an actual battle or studied military strategy in-depth, could I still follow what has happening in this story with any degree of clarity.  Unfortunately, the answer is 'No'.  Therefore the negative review must stand.	2003-04-22

The threat to humanity's existence is gone.  Thus, the danger that united Earth in its defense is no longer present to prevent the simmering national and ethnic tensions from erupting into another World War.  With nationalism running high, the children still stationed at the Battle School are kept from returning home until the Earth-bound war can be resolved, lest any party in this war get an unfair advantage from these military geniuses.  The initial war and governmental powerplays among the Triad (the Polemarch, Strategos, and Hegemon political machines) end in short order and the children are free to return home.  International tensions still simmer and threaten to explode at any time.  Suddenly, many of the battle school children start to disappear.  The mystery over what is happening to these children (who are all connected by being former members of Ender's army) and political intrigue involved in development of unifying world government of the Hegemon (mentioned with great import in \\"Speaker for the Dead\\") power the incredible thriller that is \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\". <BR><BR>\\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" continues the on-going saga of Ender's trusted lieutenant, Bean, whose story was first expanded in the spectacular \\"Ender's Shadow\\".  Bean has found his true family with his former Battle School mate, Nikolai and his family.  While content with this new life, Bean knows that trouble waits on the horizon.  Bean's arch-nemesis, Achilles, somehow escaped from a criminal mental institution during the brief League War.  As Battle School children start to disappear and an attempt is made to assassinate Bean and his family, Bean realizes that Achilles must be back in play.  In the midst of this crisis, Bean must also contend with effects of genetic tampering that made him a super-genius, but will also cause accelerated growth resulting in an early death.  <BR><BR>\\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" gives the reader a chance to delve more deeply in the backgrounds and personas of a number of different characters.  Where Bean was the primary focus in \\"Ender's Shadow\\", more time in spent exploring people like Petra Arkanian and Peter Wiggin, to name a few.  Author Orson Scott Card shows a keen knowledge of world history as he sets actions in motion that will pit one nation against another in the course of this dramatic struggle to control or restore peace to this world.  The action and plot developments are thrilling and, at times, downright shocking.  \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" plays out in similar fashion to the Season 1 of \\"24\\".  While not exploring the real-time aspect of \\"24\\", it still mimics it with the various political battles, plots for revenge, personal betrayals, and heart-pounding action.  <BR><BR>This novel, along with most of the other novels in the Ender Saga, clearly demonstrate why Card is one of the most gifted science fiction writers there is.  As stated in previous reviews of his books, Card's skill lies not in his ability write about ridiculous futuristic technologies, but to focus on the development of the individual characters.  He has a gift for dialogue and an innate ability to make the reader empathize with the characters he writes about.  Truth be told, \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" contains no elements that would make it a science fiction novel.  It could be classified as a political thriller or action novel.  It's the depth of Card's characters that make the reader not care that there aren't any spectacular space ships or alien species.  With the exception of his existential rantings at the end of \\"Xenocide\\" and throughout \\"Children of the Mind\\", Card has created a near-perfect saga.  \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" is just the latest jewel in that saga.	2003-04-18

Having violated the strict policy of the Starways Congress regarding interference with indigenous species, the human colony on the planet Lusitania has been targeted for dissolution.  The added factor of the existence of the killer (and highly contagious) genetic virus, Descolada, on Lusitania has led the Congress to order to the planet be destroyed before the colonists or other indigenous life can leave and spread the virus elsewhere.  On Lusitania, a group of colonists, led by Ender Wiggin and his adopted family, are in a race against time to find an antidote to the Descolada (not just a 'fix' like they are using currently) and find a way to stop the Fleet that is being sent to destroy the planet.  The official full partnership between the 'piggies' species and the humans threatens to break apart under the stress of the events surrounding the Descolada and arrival of the Fleet.  <BR><br />\\"Xenocide\\" is, on may levels, as equally captivating as \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" because author Orson Scott Card focuses on what he does best, character development and character interactions.  Such focus is what made \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" and \\"Ender's Game\\" spectacular novels and Nebula award winners.  \\"Xenocide\\" keeps much of that momentum going.  The politics on the planet among the species (the Buggers have also been reborn there) are quite compelling.  The efforts of the high-minded members of the human and piggie species to prevent the ignition of a bloody civil war caused by ignorant members of both species is both harrowing and suspenseful.  The events take place 30 years after \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" and Novinha's children are all grown now and play major roles in the resolution of this conflict.  Seeing how they have evolved from the broken children when Ender first arrived in \\"Speaker...\\" is one of the more satisfying aspects of \\"Xenocide\\".  The paths in life they have chosen are wholly believable and the reader can see that, without Ender's intercession decades earlier, these children might never had the opportunity to make the choices they make here.  <BR><BR>This book is nearly 600 pages long, but powers forward at a rapid clip until about the last 100 pages.  It is there that \\"Xenocide\\" goes on an existential path that would continue into, and plague, \\"Children of the Mind\\".  Without revealing any plot details, it can be said that this literary choice of Card's dramatically slows the momentum created by the previous 2 1/2 books.  Since it only occurs over the last 100 pages, it doesn't slow the reader down so much that they would be compelled to put the book down.  It does, however, make reading the sequel, \\"Children of the Mind\\", more difficult.  <BR><BR>Card seemingly wanted to explore a higher meaning in the overall story arc with this development.  It just seems unnecessary because the character-driven stories he had told up to this point clearly revealed a greater meaning that just simply science fiction novels would.  Complaints aside, \\"Xenocide\\" is still an excellent book and a good read for anyone who appreciated what \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" stood for.	2003-04-16
US	52044836	R223FBDYSZ95P0	157243547X	35249034	The Bobby Jones Story: The Authorized Biography	Books	3	44	49	N	N	Slight, wordy, but interesting, tale of golf's Bobby Jones	Bobby Jones is one of the most revered names in the rich history of golf. However, beyond the fact that all golf fans, and many casual observers, know that Jones won what was golf's Grand Slam in 1930 (U.S. Open, British Open, U.S. Amateur, British Amateur) and created Augusta National Golf Club and the Master's tournament, little is known about the man beyond a few blurbs. What better way to really learn about the man than to read the authorized biography penned by Jones' personal confidante, journalist O.B. Keeler. Unfortunately, a great opportunity seems to have been missed here. While \\"The Bobby Jones Story\\" does capture the amazing feats of golf career, it gives very little insight into the man himself. Keeler writes this biography less as a study of Bobby Jones and more as just an excited observer who was present for much of Jones' accomplishments. <BR><BR>Let it not be said that there isn't anything of worth in this book, though. The three-star rating obviously means that there are enough redeeming qualities to recommend it. The reader is able to get some insight into the pressures golf placed upon Jones. Pressure so great that he had decided to retire from competitive play following the 1930 season, Grand Slam or not. It also shows that earlier in his career, before he started winning majors, Jones could be considered by the Phil Mickelson of his era. He was gambler with his game who often went for too much with tournaments on the line and was frequently the victim of just horrible luck in tournaments, not unlike Mickelson today. <BR><BR>This book also benefits from detailing the amazing golf accomplishments of Jones. The seven-year run of success Jones had between 1923-1930 is unmatched in the annals of golf, even with Tiger Wood's modern mastery (13 major wins, including 7 straight U.S. titles). That success is made all the more remarkable by the fact that the only competitve golf Jones played during that period was at the majors. \\"The Bobby Jones Story\\" covers these matches and their key moments in great detail.<BR><BR>Alas, that three-star rating also indicates that this book suffers in many areas. Most of the problems center around Keeler's literary style and choices. One such problem may just be symptomatic of time period in which the book was written. Keeler has a tendency to use certain antiquated words when describing the action on the golf course. He uses words like 'niblick', 'mashie', and 'mashie-niblick' to describe types of clubs being used without ever explaining what exactly those clubs are. While that could just be indicative of the language of the time, it is distracting to the contemporary reader who has no idea what those are. <BR><BR>Another area where Keeler makes a mistake is with his tendency to use hyperbole to describe Jones' accomplishments. Far too many times Keeler refers to a shot made by Jones, or a round or tournament played by Jones as the 'best he's ever seen' or 'best Jones ever played'. This happens too much and leads the reader to believe that there are far too many occasions of Jones' best ever accomplishments.<BR><BR>Keeler seems to also be writing in a 'stream of consciousness' style. He skips around too much with stories he's telling. One moment, the 1925 U.S. Open is being discussed and the next line or paragraph, Keeler is talking about events in 1926 Open without using any sort of segue or transition statements to indicate to the reader that such a change has occurred. The readers will often find themselves having to backtrack just to make sure they have sequence of events understood correctly. Keeler also focuses on too short a period of Jones' life, from the start of his golfing career as a young teen until his retirement at age 28 in 1930. Keeler, himself, died in 1953 and this book was released just prior to his death. There was plenty opportunity to go into detail about Jones' creation of Augusta National and The Masters. There also should have been mention of Jones' remarkable war record in World War II. Not of that makes its way into this book and that's a shame. <BR><BR>This is not a bad read, though. Though incomplete and wordy, \\"The Bobby Jones Story\\" is still an interesting look at a portion of the life of Bobby Jones from a close, first-person observer.	2003-04-10

Ender Wiggin was viewed as the last best hope for planet Earth in decades-long war with an alien species called 'Buggers'. The journey as Wiggin began to realize the expectations of him and comes to terms with the loneliness and burden of command (and the jealousies of other Battle School children) made for one of the most compelling science fiction novels written in recent years. <BR><BR>In \\"Ender's Shadow\\", author Orson Scott Card takes the unique approach of telling the story of the same events and time period, but telling it from a completely different point of view. In \\"...Shadow\\", Card takes one of Ender Wiggin's most trusted lieutenants from \\"Ender's Game\\", a tiny spud of a child named Bean, and tells the story from Bean's angle. While such an endeavor could seem as nothing more than a lazy way to cash in on the popularity of \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Ender's Shadow\\" actually ends up telling the equally compelling of Bean. <BR><BR>Bean grew up in a virtual hell on the streets of Rotterdam. Because of rapidly advanced intelligence, he was able to survive and latch on with one of the local gangs of children in spite of meager age of four years and tiny stature. It is on these streets and in this gang that Bean learns the skills of influence and leadership while also being exposed to the worst of humanity. Certain actions by Bean catch the attention of a 'recruiter' (a nun named Sister Carlotta) for the Battle School, who recommends that he be sent there for training and as a possible last hope if the Battle School's 'secret weapon' (Ender) fails. <BR><BR>There are many parallels between \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Ender's Shadow\\", which is to be expected, given that it takes place during the same time frame. Bean, like Ender, is singled out by the administrators of the Battle School for his command potential and put in situations that earnthe envy and animosity of his fellow soldiers. Bean also must deal with an arch-enemy like Ender did. Unlike Ender's conflict with the egomaniacal Bonzo Madrid, Bean caught the ire of the cold and calculating Achilles while he was still in Rotterdam. Through an oversight, Achilles was admitted to Battle School as well and becomes a constant threat to Bean. <BR><BR>The differing story angles enhance the overall scope of the Ender's saga. In the original four books of the Ender's quartet, the events following the destruction of the Buggers are only briefly referenced as Ender goes off on his time travel exile. \\"Ender's Shadow\\" deals explicitly with what may happen one Earth once the war is over. Ender was merely concerned with defeating the Buggers. Bean is concerned with defeating the Buggers AND what will become of the unstable geo-political situation on Earth after the war is over. It truly makes for fascinating reading. At no point does the reader feel as though the events are mere rehashes of previous material. The curiosity and thirst for knowledge of the events to come that is created by \\"Ender's Shadow\\" feeds perfectly into it's sequel \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\". Such spectacular storytelling is why Card is one of the finest contemporary science fiction officers there is.	2003-04-10

It's a pattern that has set it apart from the 45 pre-NJO Star Wars novels that came before. Death of major characters and destruction of critical planets and cities have already made their mark in these novels and made their impact on the reader. \\"Traitor\\" keeps the dark story elements in place with the return of Jacen Solo to the forefront of the story arc for the first time since the horrific battle in \\"Star by Star\\". It involves deep personal soul-searching on Jacen's part, horrific torture inflicted by the Yuuzhan Vong, and a unique deconstruction of all previous notions of the 'Force'<BR><BR><BR>As most readers remember, Jacen was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong at the end of \\"Star by Star\\" with an assist by the enigmatic creature Vergere. \\"Traitor\\" deals with his imprisonment and very graphic torture at the hands of the Vong. Vong Warmaster Tsavong Lah wants Jacen used to help capture his twin Jaina, so that Lah can perform the ultimate sacrifice to the gods to ensure victory in their war with the New Republic. Scheming executor Nom Anor suggested and was made responsible for converting Jacen to the Vong way of thinking. Jacen endures some horrific torture, but with Vergere's 'help', is able to focus on pain as merely an annoyance and embrace it rather than fight it. Vergere, a enigmatic and unknown Jedi seemingly in the employ of the Yuuzhan Vong, oversees Jacen's 'education'. One moments she seems as though she is thoroughly committed to assisting the Vong in their aims, while the next moment she seems to be trying to help Jacen overcome to the torture and become strong again. Her loyalties are very much in doubt and \\"Traitor\\" plays this angle perfectly so that the reader can't ever really predict what happens next. <BR><BR><BR>To avoid spoiling some of the great plot developments, no great detail will be revealed here. It's safe to say, however, that thereader will be quite intrigued with the direction this story takes and the potential for where the future of NJO series will lead. There is even greater exposition of the inner workings of Yuuzhan Vong society and technology with the introduction of a creature called a 'world brain'. There are also many haunting scenes that take place on the ruined world of what was once the seat of New Republic, Coruscant. The imagery created in \\"Traitor\\" and thought-provoking story elements make this book a necessary addition the Star Wars library.	2003-04-09

There a additional books to tell more about this universe from alternate points of view).  For the most part this four part 'magnum opus' by author Orson Scott Card is a fabulous science-fiction/personal drama saga.  The legendary book \\"Ender's Game\\" more than lived up to the hype and was a winner of the two most prestigious science-fiction writing awards: Hugo and Nebula Awards.  It's sequel, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", was a dramatically different, but equally affecting continuation of the story of Ender Wiggin.  It, too, won the Hugo and Nebula Awards.  The third story in this cycle, \\"Xenocide\\", was closer in tone to \\"Speaker...\\" and dealt the consequences of the actions taken in \\"Speaker...\\".  For most of the book \\"Xenocide\\" was as compelling as \\"Speaker...\\" and seemed to be driving towards an exhilarating conclusion.  Unfortunately, Card took a dramatically unexpected turn in attempting to resolve the issues.  On the very surface, it seemed like a fascinating premise.  But, as Card delved more deeply into the explanations of this solution, the concept got murkier and more convoluted.  The concept of going `out' of the physical universe and being `pulled back in' at any location with no time loss seemed to be metaphysical and existential in its fleshed-out form.<br /><br />  This problem plagues \\"Children of the Mind\\" because its whole story is based upon the concluding events in \\"Xenocide\\".  Card's attempt find some deep and great meaning to everything sacrifices the very elements that made \\"Ender's Game\\", \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", and most of \\"Xenocide\\" such fine literature: it does deal with the depth of the characterization that powered the other stories.  So expertlycrafted in the earlier novels, the characters in \\"Children of the Mind\\" seem nothing more than two-dimensional caricatures of their earlier renderings.<br /><br />  That being said, the reason \\"Children of the Mind\\" still merits a positive review is because it does wrap up the `Ender's Quartet' in a satisfying manner and doesn't resort to any cheap gimmicks to bring about the resolutions.  It's an above average novel that just seems very disappointing when compared to its predecessors.	2003-03-17

As with any great author, he has his hits and misses.  Though, he more often hits than misses.  \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" is a book firmly in the former category.  The title, itself, is very clever because anyone who has ever played a round of golf in their life knows full well its meaning.  <BR><BR>   \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" is a fascinating 'fly on the wall' perspective about the ups and downs of life on the PGA Tour.  Everyone has a story to tell and Feinstein seeks to tell as many of those stories as possible.  There seems to be three separate types of players that Feinstein focuses on.  There are the low-level and brand new players to the tour for whom just making it through Qualifying (Q) School and gaining a fully exempt spot on the 'big tour' is their primary goal.  The second group he discusses are those middle of the road PGA veterans who are good enough to win a tournament here and there, perhaps even contend in a major, but will never be confused with the top stars in the sport.  Obviously, the final group he tells tale of is the superstars, whether it be stars who have passed their prime, are currently at the top of their game, or trying hard to shed the title of 'best player never to have won a major'.  <BR><BR>   The stories of the Q-School survivors are among the most compelling.  The Mike Donald's and Paul Goydos' of the world play the game for the sheer love of it, but also have just enough talent to make a living with it.  The dream of the 'big tour' requires lots of time and sacrifice.  Q-School is possibly one of the most demanding events in any sport.  For players brand new to the professional ranks, they must fight through three separate stages of qualifying with the final stage be a six-round battle royale for the precious 40 slots available on the PGA Tour.  Failing to make 'big tour' can relegate a professional golfer theminor leagues of the Nike Tour, a respectable tour were finishing in the Top 10 on the money list guarantees a PGA slot next season, or to any number of mini tours or overseas tours (like the Asian Tour and South African Tour).  Having invested so much in the dream of qualifying, anything short of a partially exempt slot on the PGA tour (which would lead to splitting the season between Nike and PGA Tours) has to be considered a disappointment.  It's much harder to make back the expenses of playing on the lesser tours and, frequently, these pros come to the conclusion that they might be better off doing something else for a living.  For those who do make it, though, it's a dream of a lifetime.  <BR><BR>   The stories of the middle-range and top-flight PGA players don't carry nearly the same amount of drama (unless you're talking about John Daly), but they still are interesting to read about. In \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\", you get a chance to watch South Africans Nick Price and Ernie Els shed his title of \\"best player to never win a major\\" by grabbing both the British Open and PGA Championship. Jose Maria Olazabal finally steps out of his mentor, Seve Ballestero's, shadow to win the Masters and become the pride of Spain. Other stories show legend Tom Watson's quest to add one more major to his already full trophy cabinet. It includes Greg Norman's continuing journey to get the Masters' monkey of his back. There is also the inspirational comeback of Paul Azinger, who was diagnosed with cancer just 2 months after winning the previous season's PGA Championship. <BR><BR>   Of course, with any season in any sport, there is controversy to be covered.  The very exacting 'Men of the Masters' (and Tom Watson) got CBS golf analyst, Gary McCord, booted from the Masters' telecast for committing the terrible crime of referring to the fast greens as having been 'bikini-waxed' among his other witty comments.  John Daly, the surprise 1991 winner of the PGA Championship, and subsequent fan favorite because of his everyman demeanor and Paul Bunyan-esque drives, stirred up plenty of trouble with his continued tendency to bolt tournaments after a bad first round and by making a very ill-advised statement that much of the PGA Tour was using performance-enhancing drugs.  The saga of 'Big John' seemed to perpetuate throughout the season.  The other big drama covered by Feinstein was the resignation of PGA Commissioner, Deane Beman, after nearly 20 years on the job, ostensibly, just to get back to playing golf.  Yet, there was clearly more to it, including an ugly public relations battle with actor Bill Murray from the previous season's Pebble Beach Pro-Am (where celebrities often team up with pro golfers prior to the final round).  Beman wanted Murray to tone down his act and Murray didn't take kindly to it.  Beman had done many great things for golfers during his tenure as commissioner, but he had also made his fair share of enemies.  In the end, Beman just felt it was time to move on.  <BR><BR>Feinstein covers so much ground with his narrative, and covers it well.  The only criticism to be offered (and what costs the book a 5-star rating) is that Feinstein seems to be too ambitious when it comes to telling all the stories of the tour.  There are so many different players to follow that it frequently becomes difficult to keep track of who's doing what and where.  That being said, it does pick up a strong momentum that powers it the rest of the way.  \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" is definitely a \\"A Good Book Read\\".	2003-02-14

In this final year, Maryland added another #1-ranked victim to its count when Maryland hammered Duke 87-73 in the last game to be played by these two teams at Cole.  There is probably no other arena in the country that has proven to be a graveyard to as many #1 ranked opponents as Cole.  In addition, Maryland finished the season undefeated at home for only the third time in school history.  Oh, and there was that little think about a National Championship.  This would have been a satisfyingly complete remembrance of Cole if the publishers had waited and the last season had been included.  Aside from that omission, however, &quot;Cole Classics&quot; still serves as a marvelous scrapbook at one of the true sports landmarks in college basketball.	2003-02-14

The first in the series, the movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, is considered by many to be one of the greatest science fiction movies ever (although, I do not share opinion, even though it's a good film).  It was followed up on book and on film by the successful &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact (Odyssey Two in the book)&quot;.  &quot;2010&quot; was a more straightforward story, but it pushed for greater ideas about HAL's existence and the purpose of the Monolith.  The third part of this series, the book &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;, reached the satisfying conclusion of the tortured Dr. Heywood Floyd's involvement in the Odyssey.  It also helped expand the understanding of the purpose of the Monolith.  &quot;3001:  The Final Odyssey&quot; presented a tremendous opportunity to tie up all the loose ends and answer all the questions.  Unfortunately, Arthur C. Clarke's choice in story direction answered all those questions incorrectly.  Clarke does reveal the purpose of the Monolith, but what he reveals renders everything we knew about it in the previous three stories totally moot.  I will not reveal what it is.  You should still read it to find out.  I just ended up being very disappointed by the resolution.  The ratings given by other reviewers show that they felt much the same way.  <BR><BR>   The irony of the story is that it had great potential.  After 1,000 years of floating in virtual suspended animation in the 'absolute zero' graveyard of space, astronaut Frank Poole's body is discovered in remarkably well preserved, and barely alive (!), form.  Poole's amazing revival has provided humanity with an unbelievable to tap into the mind of the only living person to have had first contact with the Monolith.  Poole doesn't have too much trouble adjusting the changes in the culture he knew and his newfound celebrity status.  He comes to terms with the events of the past and tries to help humanity understand the Monolith as it impacts its future.  This is actually quite an entertaining story arc and the reason I didn't give this book a one-star rating.  It just feels right reconnecting with Poole.  Alas, the book goes south when Clarke defines the purpose of the Monolith.  It's very disappointing and leaves the reader flat.  Still, for Odyssey completists, you need to read the book to see how it ends (regardless of the disappointment).  At only 274 pages, you won't have risked to great a time investment in the process.	2003-01-28

In an era in which human population controls limit families to only two children, Ender was a government authorized birth of a third child.  The reason for allowing the exception was the increase the chances of finding viable candidates to attend the military's Battle School to help win an interstellar war against an alien insectoid species referred to as Buggers.  The Wiggin family already had two children, Peter and then Valentine.  Each one demonstrated some of the characteristics the military was looking for.  Peter had the ruthless nature and ambition while Valentine had the tempered knowledge and compassion.  Combined, those traits would be exactly what the Battle School was looking for.  Hence, the government authorized Ender's birth in hopes that this 'third' would be the perfect candidate.  If so, he would be taken from the family at age 5 for Battle School training.  If not, the Wiggin family would count their blessings of having another child of their own.  Various secretive tests seemed to indicate that Ender might not be the chosen one until one day, he stands up to a bully who had been tormenting him all year.  Ender brutally attacked the bully leaving him prostrate on the ground.  He hated having to resort to violence, but he felt he had no other choice but to hurt him enough so that he wouldn't try to hurt Ender again.  That rationale proved that Ender was the answer the military's wishes.  A child with his vast capacity for knowledge and his conflicted temperament would be the perfect child to train to one day lead troops in victorious battle against the Buggers.  <BR><BR>   Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" is one of legendary works of modern science fiction.  A winner of both the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards, \\"Ender's Game\\" has found its way on to numerous school reading lists and in the heart of every science fiction fan.  Ender Wiggin is one of the more memorable characters created in sci-fi.  Ripped from his homelife at a very young age to become the next great military genius, Ender struggles mightily with his motivations to continue going and with the various tests the Battle School administrators have foisted upon him to see if he truly is the chosen leader.  Ender is emotional torn regarding his family.  He doesn't particularly miss his parents because he knows that they have already accepted that they will never see him again and have moved on.  He doesn't miss Peter because he was another violent bully in Ender's life.  He does long for the companionship of his sister Valentine because she was one of the few people he talk to and who would stand up for him.  In Battle School, Ender overcomes early difficulties and resentments to earn the respect of his fellow young soldiers through brilliant displays of leadership.  But, just as soon as he feels comfortable with his fellow comrades, he is yanked from that army and thrust into a completely new situation with older soldiers and new sets of hostilities to overcome.  All this is designed to see if Ender will end up being able to lead the full military armada that is massing for a final attack at the Bugger homeworld and will be emerging from its hyperspace journey in just a few shorts years.  Ender seeks solace in a virtual reality video game, mentorship from Mazer Rackham (the hero of an earlier Bugger War), and any number of ways avoid reaching the mental breaking point that he is careening towards.  Can he complete the training and lead the fleet in a mission to save humanity?  Are the military's objectives as clear as they would like them to seem?  In the end, will any of what Ender does, matter?  All of these questions drive Ender and provide the fuel for this spectacular story.  <BR><BR>   The Battle School is a finely realized setting for Ender's struggles.  One wonders what it would be like to enter battle training arena.  The propaganda put forth by the government and military elements harkens back to the propaganda of World War II and some of the themes in Robert Heinlein novels.  \\"Ender's Game\\" stands alone as a spectacular literary achievement and also serves as the start of the remarkable Ender's series of books.  \\"Ender's Game\\" is book to be read once and then read again and again.  Few novels have that quality.	2003-01-28
US	52044836	R1S5OINL0OJ1AX	0441007872	332040900	Forever Free	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Decent read, but lacks the astonishing depth of Forever War	There have been a number of bitterly critical reviews of &quot;Forever Free&quot; posted here, but it seems that it is more out of the disappointment of this book being much less than its predecessor, &quot;The Forever War&quot;, than it being a terrible book on its own.  After having read, &quot;Forever Free&quot;, I have come to conclude that the book, itself, is a solid, modestly enjoyable read.  Yet, it is nowhere near as good as &quot;Forever War&quot;.  The best way to categorize the difference in the two is that &quot;Forever War&quot; had the feel of a grand, sweeping, epic theatrical production whereas &quot;Forever Free&quot; feels more like a made-for-TV episode.  <BR><BR>   The story follows the lives of 'Forever War' veteran, William Mandella, his wife Marygay, and their colony of veterans and independent humans who don't wish to be a part of the new human society that has seemed to evolve to single-consciousness existence.  In addition, this single-minded human species is now a partner in space travel with the enemy race from the previous novel, the Taurans.  Not content to live out their lackluster lives on a frozen colony world, Mandella and over one hundred of the independent humans, decide to hijack the shuttle that they used to use to make time-warping 'collapsar jumps' and jump some 40,000 years in the future to see what becomes of the human species.  Alas, something goes wrong early in the voyage and the veterans are forced to abandon the shuttle and return home in escape ships with more than 30 years time having elapsed since the voyage began.  Something drastically wrong has happened on their planet and in the universe and they set out to find out the answers.  <BR><BR>   &quot;Forever Free&quot; is essentially an inconsequential follow-up to &quot;Forever War&quot;.  It seems that author Joe Haldeman was trying to make some broad statements with the crisis that these characters are forced to resolve, but, in the end, it doesn't really add upto much.  Despite the direction this book takes, I don't feel it takes anything away from its predecessor the way oh... the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels seriously damage the grand scale of the original trilogy.  As I said, it's largely inconsequential, but it's not a bad book.  So that is what earns it the rating I have given it.	2003-01-27
US	52044836	R3UV4I9YE76K71	158261461X	641511789	Johnny Holliday: From Rock to Jock	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A concise look at one of the legends of broadcasting	You know the name.  You know the voice.  If you live anywhere near Washington D.C. metropolitan area, you have undoubtedly heard his voice, in one form or another, on the radio.  He's Johnny Holliday.  Few names resonate with such recognition as Holliday's legendary moniker.  In the past 20 years, he has been most notable as the voice of the University of Maryland Terrapins basketball and football teams, and also well known for his voice-over work in radio and television ads.  Prior to that, Holliday made many stops around the country as a disc jockey and sports broadcaster.  His journeys enabled to be witness to some of the great moments and know some of the great people in music and sports history.  \\"From Rock To Jock\\" gives the backstory on Johnny Holliday and allows the reader to feel like they are a fly on the wall at all the stops along the way in his remarkable career. <BR><BR>   \\"From Rock to Jock\\" is a mixture of Holliday's own memories and the memories of those who worked with or knew him.  It makes the various stops on Johnny's journey in life more fascinating this way, to see it from multiple perspectives.  A moving foreword and afterword by no less broadcast luminaries as Tony Kornheiser and Dick Vitale, respectively, reflect just how well respected Johnny Holliday is.  Having met in him in person, I can vouch that he is just as nice and genuine a person as he seems on the radio and in this book.  <BR><BR>   Some of the more memorable stops in Holliday's journey include his early days at WHK in Cleveland, his high moments in San Francisco, and his eventual settling in his permanent home in Maryland.  San Francisco is especially memorable because the reader gets a look at Johnny's legendary charity basketball team, the Oneders (which, at one time counted NBA Hall-of-Famer Rick Barry as a member), and the impact it had on the community.  Plus, it reminisces about Johnny emcee-ing the last concert on the last tour ever done by the Beatles.  Without a doubt, \\"From Rock to Jock\\" is an entertaining read for anyone interested in learning about some of the great moments of the early and later days of radio and sports, and about the man whose career defined and is defined by those events.	2003-01-26

For a truly surreal reading experience, it doesn't get much better than Kurt Vonnegut's seminal science fiction/drama novel \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\".  Ostensibly an anti-war novel, \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" transports the readers to many different places and times following the journey of the unimpressive Billy Pilgrim.  Billy is a sad, pathetic individual who seems to have spent almost all of his existence just mindlessly wandering from one station in life to the next without much enthusiasm for it or even much interest.  He's the kind of person that, if you saw him walking down the street or met him at a party, he would leave absolutely no impression.  Billy, like many in his generation, served in World War II.  The story (stories) of this novel center on the Dresden fire bombings in the last days of the war and his survival in an underground shelter, the aforementioned 'slaughterhouse five'.  He survived the war, went back home, became an optometrist, got married, and had a life with all the trappings of suburbia.  None of it really seems to matter to him, though.  He would have been content to die in WWII for he did not want to fight.  He was joke to those that served with him in a German POW camp.  Even in his own life back home, Billy wasn't much.  He married relatively unattractive woman because that's what people did.  His colleagues didn't have much respect for him, nor did his own children in later years.  So, what was Billy Pilgrim's purpose for existing?  He seemed to think it was to spread the message of an alien race about becoming 'unstuck in time'.  <BR><BR>   \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" departs from any semblance of normal story-telling formats.  As Billy Pilgrim has become 'unstuck in time', he feels he exists in an environment where, instead of time being one chronological line, it is a series of points that exist concurrently and perpetually.  Billy falls asleep a widower and wakes up on his wedding day.  He may revisit his war experience or go back to childhood.  Billy journeys all over time because, where he's concerned, everything that has happened and will happen is all happening at the same time.  Perhaps it is the influence of the aliens that enable him to think this way, or perhaps Billy is really just suffering from severe post-traumatic stress following the Dresden bombing.  Either way, Billy is missing something in his life.  His journeys through time are his way to try and find meaning in a life where none exists.  It is a unique and existential journey for the reader and one definitely worth taking.  So it goes.	2003-01-16

This is brief graphic novel, about half the size of the traditional comic books.  It serves as a means to introducing the characters and the events that will change the lives of the Jedi and the Republic some 4000 years before \\"A New Hope\\" (It should be noted that there is another \\"Tales of the Jedi\\" graphic novel series set 1000 years prior to this one).  It introduces the reader to the characters of Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, Nomi Sunrider, Exar Kun, Alema, and numerous other names that became major players in \\"The Sith War\\".  The story follows an uprising of the followers of a dead Sith Lord named Freedon Nadd on the planet of Onderon.  The spirit of Freedon Nadd is still present and using the frail body of the evil former king of Onderon as temporary means to further his evil agenda.  Most of the action in the novel deals with the Jedi putting down the uprising and rescuing Jedi Master Arca Jeth.  However, the more important developments involve Nadd's identifying the idle rich cousins Satal Keto (sp?) and Alema as greater instruments to enforce his will.  The uprising and the former King's role in it were merely distractions to mask Nadd's greater plans.  This quick little graphic novel does a marvelous job at laying the groundwork for the treachery that is to come.	2002-12-20

Instead of telling these stories in book form, which could be a bit much in terms of asking the fan base to learn and empathize with new characters, they contracted with Dark Horse Comics to tell these stories in graphic novel format.  The series was called \\"Tales of the Jedi\\".  \\"The Sith War\\" was the first of these graphic novels that I read and it is also one of most compelling, involved, and relevant tales of the old Jedi order.  The time of the events in this story takes place some 4000 years before the original trilogy and the events and characters involved will have an impact in the modern Star Wars universe.  <BR><BR>   \\"The Sith War\\" focuses on the evil machinations of a corrupt Jedi named Exar Kun (who will play a major role in the \\"Jedi Academy Trilogy\\" books) who has become poisoned by the seductive dark side power of the Sith.  Kun used his influence to corrupt a number of good Jedi with this power.  One of these Jedi, named Ulic Qel-Droma, was so perverted by Kun's influence that he turned on his family, friends, and the entire Republic and was responsible for actions that thrust the galaxy into a devastating war.  Qel-Droma is not an evil man, just a vulnerable man corrupted by the pure evil of Exar Kun.  He comes to realize, to his horror, the consequences of his actions and tries to fight back at against Kun at great consequence to himself.  <BR><BR>    \\"The Sith War\\" provides a continuation of earlier \\"Tales of the Jedi\\" stories and answers many questions that readers may have from reading the current Star Wars novels.  \\"The Sith War\\" is notable for showing the culmination of this bloody conflict, while also explaining what happened to Exar Kun.  In addition, the warrior who was the inspiration for Boba Fett and the armor he wore is introduced here.  A brilliant military strategist named Mandalore (the inspiration of Fett's Mandalorian Armor) allied himself with Kun and Qel-Droma in this war and fought valiantly.  This graphic novel is one that the reader will go back to time and time again to read about the events of that war and to try and pick up on additional details they may have missed the first time around.  It is definitely worth getting.	2002-12-19

Disgraced Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma wants nothing more than to escape his past.  His treacherous actions during the Sith War (albeit while under the influence of the evil Exar Kun) devastated the Republic, rendered the Jedi archive planet of Ossus uninhabitable, and even caused the death of his brother Cay Qel-Droma.  Now blind to the force due to the rage of former friend and lover Nomi Sunrider (another Jedi), Ulic simply wants to find a remote planet far away from civilized worlds where he can live out the remainder of his days to atone for all the pain he caused.  Ulic believes he has found solace in a remote ice planet where no one will ever think to look for him.  Things, though, are not well back in the Republic.  Nomi Sunrider, now a highly respected leader in the Republic and among the Jedi is holding the first Jedi convocation since before the Sith War with the intended goal of promoting healing and growth in the galaxy.  Alas, there is still bitterness among some Jedi due to Ulic essentially going unpunished for his actions during the war, most notably Sylvar, whose mate, Crado, died by Ulic's hand during the war.  In addition, Nomi's busy schedule has caused her to neglect the Jedi training of her daughter, Vima, causing Vima to seek another Jedi to train her...Ulic!!  This will lead to an intersection of lives where Ulic's quest for redemption, Vima's desire to learn the ways of the Jedi, Nomi's guilt over her daughter and Ulic, and Sylvar's thirst for vengeance in a climax where every one's very soul is at stake.  <BR><BR>   As with other graphic novels, the artistry conveys the depth of emotion to a much greater degree than simple words can.  The desolation of the ice planet Ulic chose as his own self-imposed prison is unmistakable, as is the look at pain and despair crafted into each of Ulic's features.  \\"Redemption\\" pulls no punches, as the journeys and solutions are very real and very believable.  The feelings and emotions of such ordeals could easily be imagined and applied in real life.  This story provides a satisfying, if bittersweet, finale to the story of Ulic Qel-Droma and the history of the Jedi of that era.	2002-12-19

This perception that Kevin J. Anderson is the pariah of Star Wars novelists is just ridiculous.  It's presumptuous for any reader to claim that the actions and behaviors of the main characters are out of line based on who they were in the original movies.  Characters grow, develop, and evolve over time.  A great deal more has happened to them since the movies than in the movies, making certain changes in a character understandable.  Kevin J. Anderson understands this and has captured it perfectly in his novels.  He does nothing to damage the Star Wars universe.  Actually, even the author who I think is the worst of all the Star Wars writers, Barbara Hambly, still does nothing to damage the saga (she just wrote some boring books).  There is only one thing that has damaged the Star Wars universe and badly hurt depth and intricacies of this galaxy, the Jedi, the Empire, and the Old and New Republics.  That would be the prequel movies, where events are being shoved down our throats in manner that is just too neat and convenient (C-3PO being created by Darth Vader???).  In addition, the timeline presented is completely unbelievable for creating the galaxy we all came to know and love in the original movies and the expanded universe.  To say that KJA is responsible for that kind of damage to the Star Wars saga is ludicrous and irresponsible.  <BR><BR>   But, I digress.  The focus here is on the third book of Anderson's wonderful Jedi Academy Trilogy, \\"Champions of the Force\\".  This third novel brings resolves a number of story lines smoothly and appropriately.  There are important developments that increase the importance and meaning of this series.  Luke, for one, lies near death in a comatose state as a result of a battle with the spirit of Dark Jedi Exar Kun (whose force was channeled through Luke's student, Kyp Durron).  It's up to his Jedistudents to win the battle against Kun and save Luke.  The aforementioned Durron is off wreaking havoc across the galaxy with the Sun Crusher destroying numerous star systems that are loyal to the Empire.  Admiral Daala, presumed killed by one of Durron's star detonations is still very much alive and still looking to inflict heavy damage on the New Republic.  There is also the threat to Leia's youngest child from a zealous Imperial administrator.  On top of everything else, there is ANOTHER Death Star that is under construction inside the Maw installation and poses a major threat to the New Republic once it is complete.  This all makes for an exciting resolution that rivals even the final battle scenes of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".<BR><BR>   Anderson makes his 300+ pages count once again.  Each one of the storylines evokes strong imagery and invites the reader to keep anxiously turning the pages.  The saga of Kyp Durron is easily the most compelling of all the story lines.  This young kid with seemingly unlimited Jedi potential has been corrupted by the dark side and is using his power to seek vengeance against this Empire which harmed his family and stripped him of any sort of childhood.  He will clearly have to pay for his crimes, but he will also need to seek redemption from those he hurt.  Some readers feel that Durron was let off with essentially a slap on the wrist, but his punishment actually seems quite in keeping with the Jedi ideals Luke wishes to foster.  Furthermore, the impact Kyp's actions will follow him long after this trilogy.  He becomes much more an impact player in the \\"New Jedi Order\\" series, but his crimes seem to haunt him at every turn even 20 years later.  The battle involving the third Death Star is also handled well.  It may seem overkill to have yet another Death Star, but this facility had been isolated for 10 years, so it is not unrealistic to think that administrators of that facility still believed them to be valuable weapons (they clearlydid not know the fate of the first two).  The resolution of this final battle is actually quite clever and worthy of the Star Wars saga.  <BR><BR>   This trilogy flowed so well and was so exciting, that I was left craving more of the Star Wars novels.  For the two years after I finished this series (1997-1999), I acquired every remaining book in the original Star Wars series (some 45 books prior to the \\"New Jedi Order\\" series) and raced through all of them.  It is to Kevin J. Anderson that I attribute my continued fascination in the Star Wars universe.	2002-12-19

Anderson as a writer.  The second volume of this trilogy amplifies the action and the tension to such a high degree that I was cursing myself for not being able to read faster.  \\"Dark Apprentice\\" delves deeply into Luke's education of his first group of Jedi adepts.  It's fascinating to read how each of the respective Jedi students uncovers his or her latent force talents while also learning how to make the best out of force ability each one has been given.  In addition, each one seems to have talents in specific areas of the force that are more powerful than the others.  Kam Solusar seems to be a more gifted pure warrior, while Tionne uses her lesser force skills to spin beautiful music and be the caretaker of the Jedi tradition, and Cilgal proves to be a gifted healer.  Adding to the mystery, difficulty, and danger of trying to re-establishing the Jedi order is 4000-year old presence of a Dark Jedi name Exar Kun, who's spirit has been trapped inside one of the temples on Yavin IV since a horrific Jedi battle long ago (read more about this in the Dark Horse comic \\"Sith War\\").  Kun's spirit seeks to corrupt the vulnerable Jedi trainees and turn them to the dark side.  The presence of a student with seemingly greater force ability than Luke Skywalker makes Kun's influence all the more deadly.  <BR><BR>   While that drama plays out on Yavin IV, the ruthless Admiral Daala took her remaining Star Destroyers out of the Maw research installation and set about waging her own personal war against the New Republic.  After testing her forces against some less-populated, lower technology worlds, she sets out to attack Admiral Ackbar's homeworld of Mon Calamari.  The battle is on a grand scale and the resolution of this battle is quite clever.  On top of Daala's guerilla attacks on the New Republic, there is also a traitor among the Republic forces who may end up endangering Princess Leia's life and the life of her third child, Anakin.  And, the Sun Crusher returns with catastrophically devastating consequences.  <BR><BR>   Much in the same way \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" is generally considered to be the best of the three original movies while serving as a bridge between to the beginning and ending of the trilogy, \\"Dark Apprentice\\" has very much the same feel.  It's obvious that all the situations that are introduced here or continued from the first book will not be resolved in this edition.  Yet, at no time does this feel like a time filler.  It's as riveting as \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" and the cliff-hanger ending of this book leaves the reader salivating at the chance to read the conclusion to this magnificent trilogy.  KJA scores again.	2002-12-18
US	52044836	R368BJH3TG3T5O	1569714649	792536068	Star Wars: Union	Books	4	7	8	N	N	At last!  The wedding of Luke and Mara!	I guess there had been hints and clues about Luke Skywalker's and Mara Jade's potential romance throughout the entire Star Wars series of novels, but it signs didn't get strong until the early part of Timothy Zahn's &quot;Hand of Thrawn&quot; duology.  Yet, when the signs started pointing in that direction, it was really exciting to follow the progression over these two books and enormously satisfying once they revealed their love to each other.  Once that duology ended, though, the question was &quot;how is the wedding of Luke and Mara going to be handled?&quot;  Fortunately, for all Star Wars fans, it was not presented as part of written novel.  The decision to present the events surrounding the wedding and the ceremony itself as a graphic novel was the correct one.  The artistic renderings of Luke and Mara in this comic book reveal a greater depth of meaning and emotion about this momentous even than 100 pages of writing could.  There is somewhat of a disposable subplot involving some angry Imperial leftovers who are looking to disrupt the wedding, but the true focal point is the wedding itself.  There are two ceremonies, one Jedi and one general, for Luke and Mara and they are represented beautifully in the artwork.  One cannot help but feel nothing but joy for this happy couple that we have gotten to know and love over the years.  This type of happiness is well deserved.	2002-12-18

At the end of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, it seemed obvious that Han Solo and Princess Leia were going to get together and it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that they would get married shortly thereafter.  Alas, the huge task of rebuilding the Republic and establishing and workable government while also battling the remnants of the Empire took precedence and their love affair was not able to advance much further.  &quot;Courtship of Princess Leia&quot; is the story of that finally resolves all the questions about Han and Leia's romance.  Of course, it's not done without some obstacles that need to be overcome.<br /><br />  In &quot;Courtship...&quot;, Leia serves as the New Republic's Minister of State (the Star Wars equivalent of the U.S.'s Secretary of State).  She is presented with a grand opportunity to recruit the planets of the Hapes Cluster (more than 60 worlds) to become members of the New Republic.  There's a catch, though.  The royal family of Hapes will agree to have their worlds become part of the New Republic only if Leia marries Hapes' heir to the throne, Prince Isolder (reputed to be one of the handsomest men in the galaxy).  Leia is in love with Han, but knows how important it is to get Hapes to join the New Republic.  Prodded by her own ministers of protocol and advisers, Leia agrees to consider the proposal.  Han reacts badly to this news and ends up 'kidnapping' Leia and taking her to the remote planet of Dathomir, which Han apparently 'won' in a card game.  Luke Skywalker ends up being compelled by Isolder to help retrieve his sister and his wayward friend.  The journey to Dathomir leads to a number of fascinating adventures and discoveries.  Dathomir appears to be a planet that has an indigenous population of force-sensitive witches.  As with any group of force-wielding beings, there are factions of both light side and dark side witches (the dark siders being called the Nightsisters).  The story consists of trying to resolve Han/Leia/Isolder triangle, thwart treachery planned by Isolder's mother, help the light side witches defeat the Nightsisters, and deal with the reappearance of Imperial Warlord Zsinj, who has a major score to settle with Han.<br /><br />  Dave Wolverton seems to grasp the characters well enough to be true to who they are in this novel.  In the movies Han was always impulsive and often appeared hurt under his macho exterior if something got in the way of his love of Leia.  Wolverton also does a good job of creating a multi-faceted character out of Prince Isolder, as opposed to making him some pretentious royal fop with an overwhelming sense of entitlement.  Isolder understands the importance of the alliance between Hapes and the New Republic and is very taken by Leia, but he hesitant to force Leia into a marriage that she may not want.  The resolution of his conflict with Han over Leia and with his own mother's attempt to assassinate Leia does not feel like a cop-out and seems quite satisfying.  The introduction of the force-sensitive witches was also a fine addition to this novel and the Star Wars universe.  Their matriarchal society is a new element in this saga and many of their powers and characters play major roles in later novels.<br /><br />  As a stand alone novel, &quot;Courtship of Princess Leia&quot;, more than holds its own.  Wolverton created a story that plunged deeper into the backgrounds and emotions of many of our beloved characters and made their adventures come alive.  After reading the final page, one cannot help but be filled with hope for the future in the Star Wars universe.	2002-12-18

Except for Timothy Zahn (and possibly Michael Stackpole.  Both of whom are universally liked), you will get a wide array of opinions on each and every author.  There are some people who seriously dislike Kevin J. Anderson, while myself and others think he's one of the best authors of the Star Wars novels.  Some people dislike R.A Salvatore for &quot;Vector Prime&quot; (though, I suspect it has a lot more to do with a certain plot twist he was authorized to make than the quality of his writing), while others (myself included) respect his writing.  <BR><BR>   Barbara Hambly is one such writer that seems to provoke such varied debate. &quot;Children of the Jedi&quot; is her first foray into writing Star Wars novels (she followed it up with &quot;Planet of Twilight&quot;).  Unfortunately, it is quite a disappointing debut.  There are some people who love Hambly's writing and thing she is a great addition to the list of Star Wars authors.  I am not one of those people, and judging by the averaging rating her books have received, neither are many other people.  Hambly is one of those classic cases of an author who doesn't know how to get out of her own way.  She is quite enamored with her writing and ability to write long, descriptive passages (not to mention her love of overly cute terminology).  However, Star Wars novels are not the place for that type of writing.  Most readers are avid fans and already have their own picture of the Star Wars universe, its characters, ships, planets, and battles.  Unless something brand new or drastically different is being introduced, this type of writing style only impedes the progress of the story it's trying to tell.  This is disappointing because the plot of this novel is actually quite promising, but it never gets the chance to gain any momentum because of Hambly's writing.  <BR><BR>   The story, itself, focuses on our regular band of heroes quest to find the mythic ancient city that served as a haven for the children of the Jedi during the great purges under Emperor Palpatine.  In addition, a massive superweapon has come to life and is on a path to the planet of these children to destroy their haven.  This sounds like it would be the basis for a very entertaining book, but it fails under the weight of Hambly's prose.  Her love of cute phrases and terminology becomes obvious early in the book when Han and Leia are trying to figure out what place some crazed man was trying to tell them about before he died.  He kept muttering about &quot;plettwell&quot;, which they were able to determine either meant a place called &quot;Plett's Well&quot; or something else called the &quot;Plawall Rift&quot;.  Both seem to be places of some importance in this novel, but they are so similar in name and they way there are referenced is so confusing that it's nearly impossible to follow what their significance is.  This story is also hindered by the part of the plot dealing with Luke's entry into this massive superweapon ship in an attempt to destroy it.  Hambly spends an inordinate amount of time describe to looks and actions of alien creatures who are aboard the ship, but end up having no bearing on the outcome of the story.  In addition, there is a forced romance between Luke and the 'spirit' (soon to be embodied in real life) of a former Jedi named Calista.  This subplot has proven to be the bane of the Star Wars universe.  It's forced, makes little sense, and has been rendered completely moot by Luke's subsequent marriage to Mara Jade.  <BR><BR>   It's really a letdown to have a clunker of a book like this in the midst of such a high quality science fiction series.  Hambly faltered again with her second attempt with &quot;Planet of Twilight&quot;.  She has not been asked to write any more novels since then, and it's probably for the best.  From allaccounts, Hambly is an accomplished writer in other science fiction stories, but her style just doesn't fit with the Star Wars universe.	2002-12-17
US	52044836	RMTCOBI1341QC	0553575171	145330012	Planet of Twilight (Star Wars)	Books	2	31	34	N	N	So much potential.  So little delivered.	Barbara Hambly has twice proven to be incapable of handling the reins  of the Star Wars Universe. She is supposedly an accomplished science  fiction. While that may be true in other stories, she lacks the  understanding and ability to embrace the Star Wars novels and create  compelling episodes in this ongoing series. Her first attempt was  \\"Children of the Jedi\\", which was a long, ponderous, and slow  book. If a novel like this is slow, it's a cardinal sin in writing.  The reader gets bored and then frustrated with the book and is  tempted to put it down permanently. The disappointing thing about  \\"Children of the Jedi\\" was that the story, itself, had a great deal  of potential and could have (should have) been a rousingly exciting  novel.  <br />\\"Planet of Twilight\\" is Ms. Hambly's second attempt at a  Star Wars novel. Sadly, it fails for all the same reasons that  \\"Children of the Jedi\\" did. It is long, ponderous, and slow. Her  prose is so wordy that she sometimes takes up to an entire page to  describe items or scenes that should only take a sentence or two to  describe. An editor could have helped her dramatically here. Her  'cutesy' terminology also causes the reader to do a double- take and  wonder if they read what they just read. Some examples have her  referring to a coffee-like beverage as 'coffeine' and a potato-like  substance as 'topatoes'. It seems to indicate a lack of true  imagination and it's slightly insulting to the reader who would much  rather she used the original words or develop completely different  words. <br /> \\"Planet of Twilight\\" is comparable to \\"Children of the  Jedi\\" in the sense that it has an equally interesting plot that is  completely muted by Hambly's writing style. In this story, there  appears to be a Death Seed plague that is infecting the galaxy and  causing massive loss of life. In an attempt to find out what has  happened and establish diplomatic ties with the Chorios system,  Princess Leia traveled to the planet of NamChorios, where most of  the distress seems to originate. It seems the Death Seed plague is actually a species of insect-like creatures called 'drochs' that can suck the life energy out of people. Unfortunately for Leia, she gets trapped on the planet by its evil ruler, Seti Ashgad and he suspicious assistant Dzym. Because of the strong defensive system set up on the planet, she is also unable to be rescued for quite some time. Luke Skywalker, of course, tries to save his sister while also tying up the loose ends of the Calista romance. <br />  There are moments when this story seems like it could really take off  and captivate the reader.  Alas, Hambly continually confounds the  reader with her writing. I can only hope that Hambly does not get  another chance to write Star Wars novels.  People read these stories  because they are looking for an escape.  They want an entertaining  read that flows and isn't too much of a struggle to read. This isn't  a novel for a school book report.  If the writer's style makes the  novel too much of a chore to read, the reader is just going to put it  aside and not read it anymore.  That is the true mark of the failure  of a Star Wars novel and it is exactly what has happened with \\"Planet  of Twilight\\".	2002-12-16

It was the last war fought without a political agenda or national policy being the driving force.  It was fought for the purpose of preserving our own nation's way of life, the right of other nations to enjoy the same freedom, and the outright survival of people and nations.  The men who were tasked with the awesome responsibility of winning this war were your ordinary, everyday men.  From Harvard graduates to midwestern farmboys, they all heeded the call to arms.  Often referred to as 'citizen soldiers' (a title of another Ambrose book), these men were not career military.  They were civilians when they entered the war and would return to those lives upon the wars conclusion.  Yet, it was these brave men who fought against the seemingly superior forces of the German and Japanese Empires and emerged triumphant in the most critical victory over tyranny and evil this world has ever experienced.  <BR><BR>   \\"Band of Brothers\\" tells the tale of one such group of brave men whose exploits were nothing short of spectacular as the armies of the Allied nations sought to bring down the German empire.  The men of Easy Company of the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne embodied the greatness of the American spirit and clearly demonstrated why, once they entered the fray at Normandy, the tide had turned against Hitler's Army.  Easy Company was one of the true elite squadrons in World War II.  It was tasked with such crucial operations as airborne landings behind German lines to enable the D-Day landings to be a success to holding the fort during the last major German offensive at Bastogne and Battle of the Bulge.  <BR><BR>   The casualty rate for this group of men was high (150% from the point of its inception until its decommissioning after the war), but that was due to the nature of the missions.  The training these soldiers received in preparation for battle is what enabled to avoid higher casualty rates and to succeed in most of the missions they engaged in.  The men of Easy Company make no secret of their disdain for their initial commanding officer, Captain Sobel.  They considered him to be a petty, selfish, mean-spirited martinet.  They would just as soon go into battle with him leading them as go into battle without a gun.  Yet, to a man, Easy Company also says that it is because of Sobel that they were such an elite group.  If only to spite him or to avoid petty wrath, these men trained faster, harder, and better than most units serving.  It is clear from narrative that, despite Sobel's 'contribution', the true glue of unit was Lieutenant (later Major) Richard Winters and his staff non-commissioned officers.  Winters and the non-coms were so universally admired and respected by the other soldiers that they were able to be asked more of themselves and produce it.  <BR><BR>    Each soldier in \\"Easy Company\\" has his own story.  Ambrose does a fine job telling as many of the stories as possible without bogging down the narrative with too many names and unrelated tales.  There is a certain awe at the ordeals these men faced.  It's hard not to have butterflies in one's stomach as one reads about the men preparing for their first drop over Normandy under heavy fire and in dark conditions.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" chronicles these men from that initial Normandy invasion all the way until the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest and shows why this country does and always will owe a debt of gratitude to the men who 'laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom (Lincoln)'.	2002-11-06
US	52044836	R1BPS4DOVBDQLN	0671688774	20412244	Season on the Brink	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Raw, harsh, honest, and fair portrayal of the 'The General'	There are few people in the athletic arena who evoke a greater difference of emotions than Robert Montgomery Knight, aka Bobby Knight.  Knight, as coach of the University of Indiana Hoosiers, was a profane, loud-mouthed, temperamental individual who is frequently at odds with the administration and the media.  He was also a hard-driven, fierce competitor who demanded the best out of his players and got it.  This man, a walking contradiction, able to be intelligent and charming, but unable to control his temper, was unswervingly loyal to those around him and demanded the same in turn.  He got it.  Almost all who played for, or coached with, Knight still feel the strong bond with him that developed during their time there.  The controversy of the last couple of years that led to his dismissal at the University of Indiana and subsequent hiring by Texas Tech University invites an examination of what drives the man.  John Feinstein's seminal work &quot;A Season on the Brink&quot; does just that.<br /><br />  In 1985, Bobby Knight and Indiana were coming off the worst season in his tenure.  It involved a number of blow-ups by Knight (including the famous chair-throwing incident) and the first time that a Knight-led team finished out of the NCAA tournament.  After such a season where Knight was even questioning whether or not to continue coaching, it seemed highly unlikely that he would be receptive to Feinstein's project idea.  Yet, surprisingly, Knight not only agreed to it, but he gave Feinstein unlimited to access to himself, the players, and all facets of the Indiana basketball program for the entire 1985-86 basketball season.<br /><br />  Given the degree of access granted, &quot;A Season on the Brink&quot; delivers in grand fashion on the promise of showing the true inside story of Indiana basketball and Bob Knight.  What immediately jumps out at the reader, and remains a theme throughout the rest of the book, is that Knight is not the man of extremes as both supporters and detractors portray him.  He is obviously a very-flawed man.  Yet, he's extremely passionate about the sport he coaches and the players he affects.  He hates losing more than anything in the world.  Well, almost more than anything.  Dishonesty and cheating upset him even more.  Thus, more than just winning basketball games, Knight views his job as a way to prepare young men for life beyond college and beyond the court.  Knight's almost perfect graduation rate for players is a testament to that.  The strong bond those in his world feel towards him is another.  Behind all the rants and yellings during games and in practices is the burning desire by Knight to see these young men become the best they can possibly be.<br /><br />  As this book shows, Knight frequently likes to use mind games (know as 'BK Theatre') to get through to his players.  Much of his ranting is, indeed, an act.  If his players were slacking off in practices, he would call them the worst bunch of players in the country and kick them off the court only to bring them back a short while later to resume the practice.  Message sent!  It was not uncommon for individual players, especially the starters, to draw Knight's ire and be called the worst player ever to play that position in Indiana history.  Steve Alford, the All-American guard on that team (and the one that won the National Title a year later) would frequently be told this and that some player who previous played that position would never make the mistakes Alford did.  Interestingly, enough, asking any of these former players about that and it would turn out that Knight said the exact same things to them.<br /><br />  The season was filled with ups and downs.  There were dramatic highs like beating Notre Dame, and dramatic lows, like getting hammered by Michigan with the Big 10 Title on the line.  Through this journey, the true Bobby Knight is revealed, warts and all.  Yet, even as profane and belligerent man as he would seem on the surface, Feinstein's portrayal shows to be much more than that.  He's human and he has his faults, but every one of his players would go to hell and back for him.  That is the REAL Bobby Knight, and &quot;A Season on the Brink&quot; is a tribute to him in that regard.	2002-11-04

Those phrases are forever etched in the consciousness of every man, woman, and child who lived through or witnessed the terror that struck this nation on September 11th, 2001.  They will always embody the evil of men whose distorted view of Islam led to the horrific massacre of more than 3,000 lives.  More importantly, though, those phrases will also call to mind the courage and heroism of the of the firefighters, police officers, and rescue workers who rushed into the burning towers on that terrible morning to try and fight the fires and rescue the people without any regard for their own personal safety.  The tragic collapses of the towers claimed 403 of their numbers (343 of which were firefighters), but not one family member or fellow firefighter feels for one moment that the men and women who gave their lives would have a second thought about their actions, even knowing the end result.  The story of these brave men and women (both living and deceased), and those who love them, is told with undeniable power by former FDNY member, Dennis Smith (who also penned the famous \\"Report from Engine Company 82\\" about his days as a fire fighter). <BR><BR>   Smith, already an acclaimed writer for his \\"...Engine Co. 82\\" book, lived through the horrors of that day the way most other Americans did.  Not long after the attacks, he found his way down to Ground Zero the help in the rescue and cleanup efforts in any way possible.  Smith soon found that one of the best ways to help was to tell the stories of those who battled and died or survived that day:  the members of the FDNY, the NYPD, and the Port Authority Police Officers.  From his years of being a firefighter and subsequent years of continued involvement with the FDNY, Smith had close ties to a number of firefighters and firefighter families directly impacted by this tragedy.  <BR><BR>   Using his own narrative combined with the first-person accounts of many of the firefighters involved in the efforts on that day, Smith is able to re-create the terror of that day from almost 100 different points of view.  There are tales of those who watched the attacks and destruction from and afar and rushed to try get involved in the aftermath.  Yet, the stories that grip one the most are the ones of the firefighters who were actually in the buildings trying to battle the fire, rescue civilians, and eventually escape as the towers came crashing down on them.  There is no more chilling narrative than to read on firefighter's account of being in a stairwell around the 6th or 7th floor in on of the towers and realizing that the deafening rumbling was the sound of 100+ floors coming down on top of them.  There, but for the grace of God, some of these souls managed to survive while others perished.  They will tell the reader how it doesn't seem fair that they, themselves, were spared, but their partner right next to them was not.  Such pondering drives home the senselessness of the terrorists' acts on that day.  Yet, the heroism of all in involved in the rescue is driven home, too.  There is the story of firefighters who helped a large, immobilized woman down several flights of stairs just seconds before the tower came down, and stories of firefighters protecting civilians and fellow firefighters with their bodies as floors of debris come crashing down.  While difficult to read because it places the reader in the very boots of these courageous people, it also honors those very same people.  <BR><BR>   The second half of the book focuses primarily on the aftermath of '9/11', from the initial rescue efforts to the subsequent cleanup/recovery missions to the seemingly endless numbers of funerals and memorial services for those who died that day.  While a bit slower than the initial accounts of September 11th (as were all events after that day), it still captures the mood of a city and nation united by grief.  Much like the \\"9/11\\" documentary produced by the Naudet brothers, \\"Reportfrom Ground Zero\\" will stand the test of time as an extremely important document that shows the horror and heroism of September 11th, 2001.	2002-10-27

It marked the culmination of years of hard work and overcoming almost insurmountable odds by both coach Gary Williams and star guard Juan Dixon.  \\"Sweet Redemption\\" tells the tale of the separate, yet similar, journeys these two men took, along with the Maryland basketball program, to overcome tremendous hardships and reach the summit of excellence with the 2002 NCAA National Title.  Gary Williams came from a broken home to become hard driven coach and successful coach at the expense of his own marriage and estrangement from his daughter.  Williams returned to his alma mater, University of Maryland, to coach the men's basketball team in 1989, just in time for all the bad blood of Len Bias' death from cocaine and subsequent recruiting violations to cripple the Terrapin program in a way that made it impossible to win (or even get fan and university support) in those first few years.  Juan Dixon came from a harsher background.  His parents, while bright and intelligent people, were caught in the vice grip of heroin addiction.  They were in and out of prison through most of Juan's young life and he was shuttled from family member to family member to be cared for (a role that mostly fell to his older brother Phil).  Though his parents finally cleaned up, the damage was done and they died from HIV-related complications brought about by using dirty heroin needles.  Prior to his death, Juan's father made saw to his that his brother looked after Juan and made sure he got his education.  Basketball was an escape for both Juan Dixon and Gary Williams.  So, it would make sense that the two would come together and help each other achieve the highest level of success possible.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Redemption\\" does give some details into backgrounds of Williams and Dixon, but, at 252 pages, it is understandably superficial in its overall treatment of the subject.  Additionally, theprogress of the Maryland basketball program from a being nearly dismantled to winning the National Title over 13 seasons is given a perfunctory treatment.  All things considered, though, this deficiency does not detract from the overall impact of the book.  There is a list of sources in the back of the book that give reference to more in-depth material on which this book is based.  \\"Sweet Redemption\\" is designed to be a quick study and companion piece of the championship season for fans to ready and enjoy while they get re-energized for the upcoming season.	2002-10-14

It is the darkest and most difficult read since \\"Vector Prime\\".  In fact, in many ways, it's even darker.  In \\"...Prime\\", even with the heartbreak of Chewbacca's death, there was still some feeling of hope provided by a dramatic victory over the Praetorite Vong (the politically-driven arm of the evil Yuuzhan Vong invasion species).  In \\"Star by Star\\", there is another shocking and jarring death of a major character (who I will not reveal here) that occurs midway through the book and casts a dark shadow on the rest of the events in this story.  This time there is no type of victory at the end to provide hope for the future.  It's quite understandable how this book would upset longtime Star Wars fans, and even make them downright angry.  It made me feel the same way when I read it.  However, after stepping back and thinking about it, it becomes clear that this was an extremely well written story and the dark elements are right in keeping with the intended tone of the entire New Jedi Order series.  Still, this story is not for the easily upset.  <BR><BR>\\"Star by Star\\", while it continues to deal with the on-going chess match between the New Republic and Yuuzhan Vong, it focuses primarily on aggressive moves by each side designed to bring the other side closer to defeat.  The Vong have discovered beast (called 'voxyn') that detect the Force and are unremittingly violent in attacking their prey.  This proves to be a valuable weapon in the Vong's determination to wipe out the Jedi.  This is also part of the plan to remove the Jedi as an obstacle as the Vong begin their assault on the New Republic central world of Coruscant.  In turn, the Jedi plan a covert assault deep inside Vong territory, using the Jedi children, to destroy the voxyn queen and eliminate that threat.  It leads to some of the most compelling and dramatic narrative in the entire NJO series.  I dare not reveal any more.  Even though the book, itself, exceeds 600 pages, the writing flows well and there are several dramatic plot developments and twists that will leave the reader in shock and rushing from page to page to see the next turn of events.  It's a worthy read and a necessity for all Star Wars fans.	2002-10-03

Rannulph Junah is a former golden boy who, in recent years, has been ravaged by demons that he cannot overcome.  Junah was the pride of Savannah, Georgia.  He was a good-looking young kid who was also a gifted golf player.  He seemed to have every door open to him for his future.  But, then he went off to fight during World War I.  Apparently, he saw and experienced things during the war that left him shaken.  When he returned to the states, he became a recluse who drowned his sorrows in alcohol.  Fast-forwarding more than a decade shows Savannah as a thriving town with a brand new championship golf course.  The denizens of Savannah desperately want to bring fame and notoriety to this new course.  Therefore, they hatch a plan to have an exhibition tournament involving two of the biggest names in golf in that day, Bobby Jones (two years removed from golf's only grand slam and about to retire and go into practicing law... and building the Augusta National Golf Course) and Walter Hagen (a larger than life character who was always very engaging to the gallery).  Because civic pride was on the line, the organizers wanted one of their own as a third member of this exhibition.  After much debate, Junah was settled on as the most likely candidate to compete.  Of course, Junah did not seek this 'honor', nor did he wish to endure the pressure that such a selection carried.  Many of the townspeople were also concerned that Junah's erratic behavior over the previous decade could do more harm than good to the town's reputation.  <BR>   Enter Bagger Vance, a mystical figure who seems be in Savannah for only one reason, to help Junah compete in this match and to help him overcome the demons that plague him.  In a nod to Eastern philosophy, Vance helps Junah look within himself to find the answers and redemption he is looking for via 'the Authentic Swing'.  The 'Authentic Swing' is both a metaphorical and a literal representation of a place in life that all men strive for where they are not burdened by demons and distractions and are able to achieve all it is that they seek.  With Bagger Vance serving as his caddie, Junah embarks on the 36-hole odyssey of this golf match.  Early on, every hole becomes a image of the demons that Junah battles and the hopes and disappointments of an entire town.  As the match goes on, it becomes clear that each hole is not only a competition for the honor of Savannah, but also a deeply personal battle for Junah's soul.  Does he win and find redemption?  I dare not say in this review.  If you have read the book, then you know the answer.  For those of you who have not read this book, do so.  It is not only the moving tale of Rannulph Junah, but also a metaphorical look at the battles all of us face.	2002-07-12

I am not currently a member of the United States Navy, but I do aspire to be one of these days.  I want to go to Officer Candidate School, earn my commission, and hopefully embark upon a prosperous Naval career.  Of course, I know very little of what is involved in being a Naval officer beyond what I am able to glean from conversations with friends and colleagues who are current or past Naval officers.  That is why &quot;The Naval Officer's Guide&quot; is so valuable.  It gives a breakdown of all aspects of the life of a Naval officer.  It deals with areas like training, promotions, Naval customs, and common job responsibilities, to name a few.  That is just the tip of the iceberg, though.  There is so much more in this guide that it becomes an indispensable manual for those who wish to learn about what it means to be an officer, as well as being a valuable reference piece for those who are already serving.  As I read through this guide, I found myself developing a greater understanding of the Navy and finding myself able to visualize serving as an officer.  There can be no greater endorsement of literature like this.	2002-07-12

From my earliest days in elementary school (early 80's), I remember this book.  I did not then, nor do I know, have any appreciable artistic talent.  Yet, this book made very common objects, people, and places very easy to draw with a fundamental step-by-step instruction.  It gave even the least talented wanna-be artist an outlet for creative production.  I simply loved this book.  I had it checked out of the school library (with constant renewals) for almost an entire school year until the librarians put their foot down.  My parents were kind enough to buy me my own copy, and I carried it with me every day.  Even when I wasn't drawing, the setup of the book is creative enough so that a reader can almost come up with their own stories based on the drawings.  I have no idea where my old copy of this book is, but you can be sure that I am psyched to buy it again.	2002-06-19

I can't even begin to describe how much it pains me to hand the low 1-star rating to any book in the Star Wars Universe. The really cool cover of \\"Shield of Lies\\" alone should have gotten it a higher rating that that. Unfortunately, I can honestly say that the only reason I finished reading this book is because it was part of a trilogy and I was determined to read every book in the Lucas-approved Star Wars timeline. This book was simply an extraordinary chore to read. It is made all the more disappointing by the fact that the initial book in the Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy, \\"Before the Storm\\", was quite good. It had all manner of elements that makes Star Wars so entertaining: political debate and intrigue in the New Republic over the creation of the military's 5th Fleet; A genocidal race of aliens called the Yevetha (led by a Hitler-esque ruler named Nil Spaar); and superb battles taking place between the New Republic and the Yevetha. All of these elements allowed \\"Before the Storm\\" to move at a rapid clip while creating a story that was very involving. \\"Shield of Lies\\" destroys all of that. If ever there was a book that seemed like it was just biding its time between the first and third books of a trilogy, this one is it. <br />Author Kube-McDowell made two disastrous mistakes in writing this book. The first was the narrative style he chose for writing it, and the second was the specific story elements he spent most of his time focusing on. In \\"Before the Storm\\" and in the trilogy final \\"Tyrant's Test\\", Kube-McDowell followed the tried and true method of quickly cutting between each of the various subplots and weaving them together to help the story flow. In \\"Shield of Lies\\", he decides to change his format to very long individual chapters that are almost the length of mini-novellas. The average chapter length is about 40-50 pages. This is incredibly tedious reading if the reader is not interested in the particular subplot being covered. Perhaps if Kube-McDowell hadfocused on more compelling elements of this trilogy, the long chapters would not have been so troublesome. Unfortunately, the bulk of the time spent in this book is on two of the most inconsequential and tedious storylines in the history of the Star Wars Universe: Lando Calrissian's exploration of something called the Teljkon Vagabond, and Luke's hermit-like existence and search for his mother. Lando's 'adventure' involves Lobot (who you might remember from \\"Empire Strikes Back\\"), C-3PO, and R2-D2 and consists of nothing more than the four of them wandering around a long, meandering labyrinth. It's practically impossible to visualize what they are doing and even if the reader starts to grasp it, it doesn't seem like anything of any consequence is being done. The other subplot, Luke's hermit-like state and search for his mother, has been rendered totally irrelevant by the Episode I movie and by all the novels that followed Black Fleet Crisis. Luke seems to be in some sort of mental state while in search of his new purpose in life and gets drawn into a quest to search for a clan of nomads where his mother might be. These nomads use some force called the 'White Current' which is simply a euphemism for the Force, itself, and, at no point, does Luke even come close to finding his mother or what happened to her. Based on Episode I, though, we're pretty sure she's not apart of this group. Both subplots are monumentally boring and made even worse by the fact that the reader has no reason to care about either one. <br />Kube-McDowell managed to not kill the whole trilogy by writing a relatively compelling \\"Tyrant's Test\\" to finish the tale, but \\"Shield of Lies\\" is such a tremendous disappointment that if the reader is not determined to read all the Star Wars books, I would recommend skipping this one.	2002-06-14

We have all heard the stories of his feuds with co-stars, failed TV shows, unique musical 'talents', and THAT HAIR!  Now, in one place, the Star Trek and William Shatner fan can find a reference to everything that is Shatner.  His detractors will find everything they want as well.  Mr. Schnakenberg does not pull punches with his A-to-Z chronicle of Shatner's life.  He delves into the ugliness of his disputes with fellow actors (most notably, James Doohan... aka 'Scotty') and his notable difficulty in his personal life (on his third marriage at the time of this book's release and now currently on his fourth following the tragic death of his third wife).  But, he is also fair in his depictions.  He goes to great lenghts to show caring and respect that both Shatner and Leonard Nimoy have for each other despite years of tension on the Star Trek set.  Not to mention exploring the positive value of his \\"Rescue 911\\" TV series.  Of course, there are also many humorous moments that are documented.  Shatner's foray into the music industry with 'interesting' \\"The Transformed Man\\" album (now a cult hit) is covered as is one of the funniest moments in Saturday Night Live history when Shatner, playing himself, tells the assorted weirdoes at a Star Trek convention to \\"get a life!\\".  Simply a fun read from beginning to end, the \\"Encyclopedia Shatnerica\\" is an cool addition to any person's library.	2002-06-12

He has written books covering everything from the harshness of playing for Bobby Knight (\\"A Season on the Brink\\") to romance of the little schools of the Patriot League (\\"The Last Amatuers\\").  When \\"A March to Madness\\" was released, I was quite pleased to find a tribute to a season that was so memorable to me.  At the dawn of the 1996-97 NCAA Basketball season, I was in my second year at the University of Maryland.  I found it difficult to really get into the basketball team my first year because it seemed like more hype than product.  It was in 1996-97, that I truly began to embrace the Terrapins.  \\"A March to Madness\\" chronicles their up-and-down season along with the other eight members of the ACC basketball conference (thought to be the best in the country).  Feinstein was given unlimited access to all the teams by all the coaches (save for North Carolina's Dean Smith, who is notoriously stingy about that kind of access) and, as a result, put together a compelling record of, not only the season itself, but the background of the players, schools, and coaches that made that season what it was.  Feinstein tells the story of Duke's Mike Krzyzewski leading the Blue Devils' resurgence to the top of the ACC standings just two years after a debilitating injury crushed himself and the Duke basketball program.  He follows the quest of Dean Smith to break Adolph Rupp's all-time wins record.  The journey of the conference's and country's best player, Tim Duncan of Wake Forest, to end his memorable 4-year career with a National Title comes to an end much too soon and is captured in agonizing detail by Feinstein.  Feinstein also covers other notable stories like the surprising run by the upstart Maryland Terrapins to a Top 5 ranking before lack of depth and experience caused them to fall back to the back and the inexplicable implosion of Georgia Tech just one season after it missed the ACCTitle by two points.<br />Feinstein's gift when it comes to writing is that brings life to the people he covers rather than just treating them like statistics in a news report.  In \\"A March to Madness\\", the reader comes to understand the backgrounds and struggles of all of the coaches.  On one level or another, the reader can identify with all of them.  Feinstein treats the notable players much the same way.  This book is a quick read and a truly memorable exposition of the mad world of ACC Basketball.	2002-06-12

Mike Lupica's, \\"Summer of 98\\" was not far behind.  What makes owning both books worth it is that each one presents a different way of remember that season.  \\"The Perfect Season\\" is an excellent companion piece and reference manual for that year because McCarver breaks down all the events vividly in separate chapters.  Lupica's presentation is more chronological and revisits the day-to-day emotion every true baseball fan felt following baseball that year.  There have been many past baseball seasons that have been romanticized in newspaper print and book pages (notably the \\"Summer of 41\\", with the amazing seasons of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio), so the precedent had been set for narrative of \\"Summer of 98\\".  Lupica, in true McGwire fashion, hits a home run in reliving the year.  The centerpoint of the story focuses on how he and his son shared and developed an indelible bond following everything from the record home run chases by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to the amazing excellence of their beloved Yankees (on their way to a record 125-win season... counting playoffs).  On nights when his son could not stay up to watch McGwire at bats or Yankee games, Lupica would leave him notes in the morning recapping what happened the night before.  As a fan of baseball myself, it took me back to that year and seasons past when I would get up at the crack of dawn the grab the paper and go right to the sports section to see what happened.  I had fond memories of following my beloved Orioles during their almost miraculous 1989 season and of trying to see if anyone could break Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs.  1998 had all that amazing magic and \\"Summer of 98\\" relives it with such vivid detail.	2002-06-10

The two most notable ones were &quot;Summer of 98&quot; by Mike Lupica and &quot;The Perfect Season&quot; by Tim McCarver.  McCarver is a long-time baseball analyst on a myriad of networks.  Often bombastic and overblown with his commentary, he hits the 1998 season right on the mark.  It may very well be 'the perfect season'.  In the aftermath of the 1994 baseball strike, Major League Baseball had struggled to regain its foothold in the American psyche.  As recently as 1997, underachieving seasons by so many teams led to a World Series that, while a dramatic 7 games, was also a horribly ugly matchup between Cleveland and Florida.  The only glimmer of hope in that season was the home run tears that Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. went on.  Their challenges to the Roger Maris' home run record entertained the nation, but ultimately both fell short, with Griffey hitting 56 and McGwire hitting 58.  Little else in that season did anything to attract fans back to the park.  The 1998 season dawned with a auspicious feel to it.  Mark McGwire was going to have a full season in St. Louis to go after Maris' record and there were some exciting prospects coming up in the minor leagues.  But, few could have expected the incredible form this year would take.  From Mark McGwire's Opening Day grand slam until the final out of the World Series, 1998 had it all.  In &quot;The Perfect Season&quot;, McCarver creates an indispensible companion to the year.  He breaks down each of the season's major accomplishments in separate chapters and writes each like a little kid excitedly spouting everything he could think of about what he saw.  This approach works quite well for the nature of the material.  Obviously a great deal of time is spent on the spectacular home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa (in which both broke Maris' record and continued their mano-a-mano battle until the final weekend) and the unbelievable season in which the New York Yankees won 114 regular season games (and 125 overall) on their way to another World Championship.  There are some other fascinating topics covered, like the emergence of Cubs rookie pitcher Kerry Wood with his 20-strikeout game, David Wells' perfect game, and the resurgence of the Chicago Cubs, who made the playoffs for the first time in 9 seasons.  Additionally, there are some lesser known details of the season that McCarver brings to light, such as Houston's Craig Biggio becoming the first player since Tris Speaker to have 50 doubles and 50 steals in the same season, and Giants' Jeff Kent becoming the first second baseman since the legendary Rogers Hornsby to have 120 Rbi's in back-to-back seasons.  McCarver covers all the bases with vivid clarity.  This book is a quick read and worthy recap of &quot;The Perfect Season&quot;.(in which both broke Maris' record and continued their mano-a-mano battle until the final weekend) and the unbelievable season in which the New York Yankees won 114 regular season games (and 125 overall) on their way to another World Championship.

US	52044836	RWZOGQZB8T2G	0380708213	223407615	The Forever War	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Masterpiece about war and society in the future	While I have long been a science fiction fan, it was a friend of mine who introduced me to Joe Haldeman's seminal work about the war and society in the future.  From the very opening chapter, I was captivated vivid characterizations of the soldiers and locales of this time period.  The first few chapters focus on the training of the elite soldiers of UNEF (United Nations Elite Force) to do battle with some far away alien race that Earth is at war with for some reason.  The training takes place in the absolute zero temperature environment of the moon, Charon, of the planet Pluto.  The description of the training environment and training exercises are well thought out.  The reader can truly believe the activities that take place upon that moon from the results of exposure to the environment to the explosive reactions certain elements will have in those conditions.<br />Haldeman's writing in \\"Forever War\\" is effected by his experiences in Vietnam.  The pointlessness and sacrifices of that war are closely paralleled in this book.  No one who is fighting this war is sure why Earth is at war with the Taurans.  In fact, few have even every seen the Taurans, as the alien planet is light years away from Earth.  Reaching it requires the use of temporal anonmalies called 'collapsers' which allow the spaceship to travel vast distances in short periods of time while years, decades, even centuries pass in real time.  The focus of the story isn't really even on the war itself.  There is one brief confrontation with the Taurans at one point, but not much of any consequence happens, and when the soldiers return to Earth, they realize that there has actually been peace with the Taurans for 200 years.  All manner of personal connections and societal development disappear under the circumstances these soldiers are forced to live in.  Behaviors such as homosexuality and promiscuity, which are still considered morally wrong by many in this day an age, are generally accepted and even encouraged during this time period.  The reason is not because of looser morals, but because outright necessity.  Sexual release becomes a recreation activity for the soldiers and with health closely monitored, pregnancy and sexual transmitted diseases are non-existant.  Without giving away too much, it's reassuring see the story end on a note that recalls our more familiar life in midst of a seemingly alien and uncomfortable future.  <br />The futility of the war and the huge sacrifices made by those who fought it are difficult ideas to read about, but Haldeman helps the reader picture it in a fully-developed and realized manner that enables to understand and empathize with the characters and take solace in the destiny they achieve.	2002-05-31

Nearly a decade after Return of Jedi was released, the excitement of the Star Wars was rekindled and expanded for the original fans (and introduced a whole new generation to the Star Wars Universe) with the release of &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; by Timothy Zahn.  This introduced a-45 book sequence over the next 8 years that took covered everything from the early days of Han Solo to the final truce with the Empire (also written by Zahn) and several story lines in between.  The unique approach was to have several stand-alone novels and many trilogies each handled by a separate author (though some had return engagements).  With the final peace with the Empire being achieved, the original 45-book sequence had run its course.  The creative forces at LucasBooks sought to create a brand new story arc, introducing a new menace (hinted at in the final original series book &quot;Vision of the Future&quot;) that was so horrifying and dangerous that the conflict could not be resolved in one or three books.  Rather, it would be carried out over a new 5-year, 25-book story arc.  &quot;Vector Prime&quot; is the first book in that series that introduces to the truly terrifying Yuuzhan Vong race.  This race of tattooed, mutilated warriors believe embrace pain the way a human would embrace a loved one.  This extra-galactic species invades the New Republic with a determination to eliminate the 'abomination' of artificial technology (through the use of organic ships and technology) and destroy or enslave the indigenous 'infidels' who don't embrace the Vong philosophy.  The invasion had been plotted for over 50 years.  In &quot;Vector Prime&quot;, the first faction of Vong (a political group known as the Praetorite Vong) penetrate the seemingly impenetrable galactic barrier at a point known as Vector Prime (hence the title).  By taking over a small research planet and transforming its ecology to support the growth of more ships, the Vong establish a foothold from where they plan to control the rest of the galaxy.   &quot;Vector Prime&quot; introduces or develops many new characters while bidding farewell to a longtime favorite.  For the first time in a mainstream Star Wars novel, Han and Leia's Jedi children come into their own.  They now have distinct personalities and destinies they must face independent of their parents.  For the first time, the reader also reads about Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker as a married couple, as Mara battles a brutal disease brought upon her by a hidden Vong agent.  This book also means the death of the great Chewbacca.  The death had been hinted at for months and doubtless angered many longtime Star Wars faithful.  However, Chewie died in the most honorable way possible: Saving Anakin Solo's and many other lives on the planet Sernpidal which was about the be destroyed by its moon knocked out of orbit by one of the Yuuzhan Vong gravity-warping Dovin Basals.  As the Millennium Falcon is forced to speed away in order to save the lives of all aboard (and having no chance of saving Chewbacca) the last indelible image of the great Wookie standing tall, fists raised, howling at the moon as it crashes.  A more honorable, heart-wrenching finale could not have been made.  The loss also has a devastating effect on Han Solo, who is so grief-stricken by the death of the person he considered closer than a brother that it will be several books before he is even able to remotely come out of his depression.  The invasion sparks panic and controversy throughout the New Republic.  In the end, the Republic is able to mount an offensive that is able to destroy in the Praetorite Vong's invading world ship.  But, the seeds of the invasion have been planted and the New Republic seems powerless to stop it.  &quot;Vector Prime&quot; is a truly fabulous introduction to this struggle.  R.A. Salvatore has remained true to the original characters while effectively developing brand new ones.  Hopefully, Salvatore will be brought back for future engagements.  &quot;Vector Prime&quot; launches a brand new era in the Star Wars Universe, the New Jedi Order, and inspires the promise of a gripping and compelling story arc for all Star Wars fans.	2001-04-19

My mother first recommended this book to me not long after I had seen the movie &quot;The Day After&quot;.  I can rightly say that I have never been so emotionally gripped by a novel.  I couldn't bear to ever put it down.   Now, enough of my gushing, here's the real dirt on why this is one of the  most phenomenal novels ever to tackle the subject of Nuclear War:<br />    It  addresses the topic of a nuclear war not in the context of techno-thriller  explosions, but in the context of the horror of is aftermath.  Once all the  political and military hotheads have finished blowing each other to pieces,  all that is left to do is come to terms with the disaster and it  implications (a topic made even more timely by the recent nuclear testings  by India and Pakistan).<br />    The one aspect of &quot;On the Beach&quot;  that had a profound emotional impact on me was how the last remaining  survivors cope with reality of what has happened.  Some panic, while others  cling to the unrealistic hope that the disaster is not as bad as they  thought.  Soon, this all gives way to melancholy emotion of accepting the  inevitable.  While death is common in everyday life, it is tempered by the  knowledge that life will go on.  The saddest and most profound emotion  Shute creates is the despair in knowing that after death, there will no  longer be life.	1998-11-16
