Orson Scott Card set a high standard for himself with \\"Ender's Game,\\" and it's hard not to compare \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" with its popular sci-fi predecessor. \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" catches up with Ender Wiggin a few thousand years after he blew away the Buggers. Ender is summoned to Lusitania, a remote colony where humans live a tenuous co-existence with the Piggies, an intelligent life form who inhabit the planet's forests.<br /><br />\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is a story that's difficult to pin down. This could be the novel's strong point, and also its key weakness. Card's wunderkind, now in his 30s, grapples with the guilt of exterminating an alien race. He also struggles to come to terms with his family, a smarmy computer that inhabits his head, and his Lusitanian devotees, who come to worship Mr. Wiggin with galactic aplomb.<br /><br />If you're a dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi fan, you'll probably go ga-ga for \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\"  Those who are less enamored of the genre are better served reading \\"Ender's Game\\" and stopping right there.	2005-09-25

Galbraith was a Harvard economist in 1954 when he published \\"The Great Crash 1929\\", just 25 years after the event occurred.  He relied heavily on newspaper accounts and congressional testimony for his research. As a result, the book lacks a first-hand perspective that could have been achieved by interviewing the participants in the fiasco, many of whom were surely still living when Galbraith conducted his work.<br /><br />That said, \\"The Great Crash 1929\\" is worthwhile reading. It's natural to compare the causes of the 1929 crash with the events that led up to the market correction in 2000-2002. Although Wall St. and the financial infrastructure have come a long ways since the late `20s, Galbraith notes that human nature cannot change and \\"inaction will be advocated in the present even though it means deep trouble in the future.\\" Those words will resonate for anyone still licking his wounds from the implosion of the late-90s dot-com mania.	2005-08-15

Four of these reviews included the word \\"powerful\\" to describe the story.  That pretty well captures the effect that Khaled Hosseini has on his readers.<br /><br />\\"The Kite Runner\\" is set part in Kabul, part in the San Francisco East Bay.  The story follows the tormented life of Amir, a well-to-do Afghanistani who emigrates to the US in 1981 after Russian troops invaded his homeland. Central to the story is his relationship with Hassan, the son of the family servant and a loyal childhood friend.  Amir's betrayal of Hassan is a shadow that he can't run from.  It leads him back to Afghanistan in 2001 where redemption awaits him.<br /><br />Hosseini avoids politicizing his novel too heavily.  Granted, his descriptions of Taliban atrocities, carried out by a one-time neighborhood bully, are poignant.  But little time is spent exploring global events.  9/11 comes and goes in a sentence, and politics remain quietly in the background.  That said, Hosseini's most powerful achievement may be putting a human face on the Afghan people.  Hosseini came along at the just right time to tell this inspired tale.	2005-08-08

And Thomas Friedman, for all his best efforts, manages to rankle plenty of nerves with his 1989 book (updated in 1995) covering the conflicts in Lebanon and Israel.<br /><br />\\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" is Friedman's part-analysis, part-memoir from his nearly 10 years as the New York Times correspondent stationed in these two cities. The book is a lucid account of the background and status quo in the Middle East through 1994. At 571 pages, it's hardly a quick read. But those who feel that they should know more about the situation in the Middle East could do worse than plunging into this book, and sticking with it to the end.<br /><br />Readers with strong opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may find their blood boiling while reading Friedman's work. The author is loath to take sides between the Israelis and Palestinians. He asserts that neither side can claim the higher moral ground in the cycle of violence and control in this region. Nor does Friedman throw bouquets at Israel's neighbors, the US government, nor the Arab world. The conflict is a morass with no easy solution, and Friedman shows only reluctant signs of optimism in the book's final chapter.<br /><br />The Israeli partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank has put this book back on the radar screen. Friedman's reputation ensures that people with questions about the conflicts in the Middle East will turn to him for answers. \\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" educates, but don't expect to find any easy answers inside.	2005-08-02

The book follows the lives of six main characters through a long dark winter and into the spring. Each of these individuals -- two pairs of brothers, a high-school girl, and a middle-aged man -- has his own cross to bear and does so with quiet determination.<br /><br />Although the author's style may strike the reader as melancholy, or even a little sappy, you'll probably find the book uplifting. Plenty of bad things happen to our protagonists, from the mundane to the serious, but each pulls through to reveal a generous and caring personality.<br /><br />\\"Plainsong\\" is a thoughtful little book written in a sparse and lucid voice. The chapters are a bit choppy and disconnected at first. But once the interrelationships are established, the story moves along much more smoothly.  You may be frustrated at first, but stick with it -- \\"Plainsong\\" is worth reading to the end. My only quibbles are with punctuation (perhaps there's a good reason for not using quotation marks), a couple of loose ends at the end of the book, and some icky scenes involving farm animals.

The former Wall Street semiconductor analyst takes the reader through the ups and downs (but mostly ups) of Velocity Capital, the tech-focused hedge fund that he and Fred Kittler founded in 1996.<br /><br />\\"Running Money\\" is a combination of economic theory, investing vignettes, and Silicon Valley anecdotes. Kessler doesn't delve into the details of running a hedge fund, but focuses instead on the big picture. An early chunk of the book is dedicated to recounting the evolution of the market for steam engines. And an interesting chapter late in the book -- \\"Why It's Imperative to Drive a Beemer\\" -- discusses America's trade deficit and \\"margin surplus.\\"<br /><br />\\"Running Money\\" hardly lets the reader be a \\"fly on the wall\\" of a hedge fund. The business aspects of running a fund -- marketing, legal issues, risk management, etc. -- are barely addressed in this book.

Her story covers three generations of her family's history.  Chang's grandmother was a concubine whose feet were bound at the age of 2, just before the practice disappeared in the early 20th century.  Chang's mother was a hard-working government bureaucrat whose passion for Communism glowed brightly in 1949, but was extinguished during the repressive years of Mao's leadership.  And Chang herself endured the hardships of life in China in the 1960s and 1970s, but emphasizes that her suffering was minor compared to that of her countrymen.<br /><br />\\"Wild Swans\\" is a great book.  It's one of those rare finds that both educates and captivates.  Readers who have an interest in Chinese history will discover a fascinating account of life under Mao and Deng.  And those who enjoy a first-person memoir from an author who led an interesting and challenging life will be drawn in by Chang's stories.  \\"Wild Swans\\" isn't the best-known memoir out there, but it's a good one to read and share with others.	2005-05-02

Cahill takes a breather from his normal globe-trotting ways to focus on a slice of the great outdoors, Yellowstone Park. The world's first national park is just 50 miles from Cahill's home in Montana, so it's no surprise that this 2.2 million-acre park is the subject of a classic Cahill travel book.<br /><br />Whether you've been to Yellowstone or not, you'll appreciate the author's perspective. He takes a stab at describing the natural wonders of the park - geysers, basins, wildlife - while also including some history and philosophical musings about previous explorers.<br /><br />\\"Lost in My Own Backyard\\" is light reading, and I mean really light reading. Some of the shorter essays (3 to 4 pages long) hardly do justice to the day hike or back-country adventure that Cahill purports to share. And when you reach the end of this book an hour or two after you've started reading it, you'll feel like the book hasn't even begun yet. But I suppose that's the sign of a great writer covering a great subject. The material draws you in and the author's style is a pleasure to read on any subject.	2005-03-07

Stegner tells the tale of Bo Mason, who leads a rootless life on the fringes of the law. Mason is a bootlegger, gambler and precious metals speculator.  Each peak he achieves is higher than his last, and each valley is deeper. This is true both financially and in his relationship with his wife, Elsa, and two sons, Chet and Bruce. Some reviewers point out that the story is somewhat autobiographical. That's probably a safe assumption. But it's also the story of the American West a century ago, where raw optimism, the struggle for acceptance, and harsh realities shaped people's existence.<br /><br />The harsh reality of \\"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" is that it isn't one of Stegner's best works. Of course, that's a very high standard. Readers will understandably have great expectations when diving into this book, and some may be disappointed. For example, the younger son's seething hatred towards his father is introduced early in the book and is central to the conclusion, but is poorly developed in the interim chapters. Likewise, the voice of the book drifts between the 3rd person and the 2nd person. This gives the reader a voyeuristic glimpse into each character's personal thoughts. It's a nice gimmick, but awkwardly executed.<br /><br />On an absolute scale, this book is a no-brainer 5 stars. But relative to other Stegner novels, \\"The Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" has some minor flaws. Read it and you'll certainly enjoy it. But you'll appreciate even more the experience of reading the early efforts of one of America's greatest 20th century writers.	2005-03-05

Browning keeps his focus on the atrocities committed by this 500-man battalion, without straying to discuss related parties or neighboring geographies. Far from creating a myopic study, this focus serves to underscore the breadth of the Nazis' extermination program during the Second World War. The key strengths of the book are Browning's careful research of German judicial archives from the 1960s, as well as his balanced interpretation of the battalion's crimes and of humanity's capacity for committing organized mass murder. The main shortcoming is that the author's analysis is saved almost entirely for the last chapter, rather than accompanying the relevant passages. This creates a dichotomy which is only a minor drawback to an otherwise extraordinary historical work.	2005-02-01

These ambitious stories don't always click, particularly when the author doesn't know enough to put a bullet in his work when it can't get off the ground. But \\"Morgan's Run\\" bucks this unsettling trait. Colleen McCullough put her heart into this story - family ties help explain why - and the reader benefits from her careful research and enormous passion for her subject.<br /><br />\\"Morgan's Run\\" follows the life of Richard Morgan, a tavern-keeper's son who is wrongfully convicted of a crime in England and is subsequently banished to the experimental penal colony on Norfolk Island to serve out his seven-year sentence. The book is certainly not without its foibles. McCullough, whose husband is a great-great-great-great grandson of the real Richard Morgan, depicts her hero with Roman, god-like qualities. It seems that there's no problem, either physical or mental, that Richard is incapable of solving, nor is there a man or woman whom Richard doesn't charm to the bone. That said, a unique cast of characters, coupled with an interesting historical narrative, more than compensate for the oh-so-romanticized qualities of McCullough's beloved &uuml;ber-convict.<br /><br />Some may quibble that the book moves along too slowly, that we're still mired in England on p. 250 and stuck on that boat on page 400. If that's your beef, then steer clear of \\"Morgan's Run\\". The story is languid at times, and frustratingly contrived at others. But as far as historical epics are concerned, \\"Morgan's Run\\" rises above most others.	2005-01-23

To be sure, Reed is a provocative writer.  His resume speaks volumes to his varied literary talents -- poet, novelist, essayist -- and large swaths of the boook reflect these skills.  Reed tells it like it is in Oakland and he's surely developed a deep fondness for his adopted hometown.  Sadly, though, the book frequently veers off course and morphs into political tirade.  In other parts, Reed descends into bitter racism.  This, in itself, doesn't make the book a disaster.  But it certainly seems that the author taints what could have been a timeless memoir of Oakland with large dollops of political and racist invective.  After all, Jerry Brown will some day leave office.  But \\"Blues City\\" deserves to stay on our shelves for many years to come.	2005-01-01

The book takes a stab at portraying the fall of the Roman Empire. But instead of Rome, the scene is the distant planet of Hafardine, and instead of Caesar and Brutus, the cast include Verice Demansk, a lunky bloke with a flair for the officious, and his network of friends, family and foul-smelling enemies. I don't mean to belittle the plot. My main problem with this book is that it's sci-fi by committee. The characters are introduced and forgotten as quickly as last year's reality show. And the stilted language of our heroes - by the gods! - is enough to give anyone a punishing headache. Perhaps \\"The Tyrant\\" would have been less tyrannical had the book been about 200 pages shorter.

But the book is as much about the team and its devotees as it is about the social tensions and economic challenges of life in west Texas in the late 1980s.<br /><br />Many people, myself included, are attracted to this title because of the movie that came out earlier this year.  Reading FNL before -- or after -- seeing the movie is a good call.  Whereas the movie focuses on the gridiron action and the melodramatic relationships between players and their families, the book is more ambitious and, presumably, more accurate.  Hollywood sold a lot of tickets by dressing things up.  Bissinger sold a lot of books by telling it like it is.<br /><br />Those who aren't fans of football needn't shy away from \\"Friday Night Lights.\\"  Granted, there are chapters in which the play-by-play takes center stage.

Although the book omits several important events (e.g., Wall Street's role in the post-war development of Japan, anti-trust litigation against IBM, etc.), few will fault Geisst for being incomplete in his work. Significant firms and personalities receive due attention, and readers who were following the scandals of the 1980s and 1990s (Boesky, Milken, S&L's) will appreciate the latter-day perspective.  My only quibbles are that the prose is a little dry, and the amount of facts crammed into 367 pages makes it tough not to feel a little overwhelmed.  \\"Wall Street\\" ends with Greenspan's prescient comment about \\"irrational exuberance\\" in the US equity markets in 1996.

The book doesn't pretend to glorify the easy money that Lewis and his ilk made during the bond schlepping go-go days of the 1980's. Rather, Lewis is disillusioned by the greedy culture and hypocritical short-sightedness at Salomon Brothers, but not enough that he doesn't enjoy the ride for a few oh-so-profitable years. Like his other books, \\"Liar's Poker\\" is fun to read. His anecdotes about the training program and the trading floor, albeit surely embellished, read like a day at the amusement park. The key shortcoming is an oozy 20-something self-righteousness that pervades many of the book's chapters, and reaches a crescendo in the final pages. But hey, arrogance begets credibility. And when it comes to describing Wall Street in the 1980's, Lewis is as credible a spokesman as anyone.	2004-07-06

Christensen's strong points include a creative presentation of data, lucid writing and frank admission that the advice in his book is not a one-size-fits-all panacea for management challenges.  But a heads-up to readers:  perhaps 50% of the book centers on the disk-drive manufacturing industry.  Although the lessons learned in hard drives are interesting, a more balanced approach would have been welcome.  &quot;The Innovators Dilemma&quot; is a well written management how-to, in the same league as classics by Peters or Hammer.

Benitez slips in a few comments about the senseless nature of civil war, without haranguing on this all-too-obvious point. \\"The Weight of All Things\\" is definitely a quick weekend read.  Chances are, you'll learn something about the El Salvador conflict, and in the process gain renewed appreciation for the easier lives that most of us live.	2004-03-18

Compared to his other books (I've read &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; and &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;), this one doesn't seem to have much of a spark.  It feels like he wrote it more for himself, and less for his readers, as a way to reacquaint himself with the United States after a 10-year stint in England.  That said, I enjoyed reading &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; all the same.  Sure, his bleating and whining about American foibles gets a little old, but his sense of humor and poignant observations are classic Bryson:  just good, clean cantankerous fun.  If you're looking for a great piece of travel writing, I don't recommend &quot;The Lost Continent.&quot;  Nor will you like it if you're thin-skinned about American criticism.  But if you want a quick and enjoyable read, with plenty of humorous tales, then Bryson, as usual, won't disappoint you here.	2004-03-13

This book is a real dark horse. It doesn't appear to be widely known (I found it for sale on the used-book cart at my local library) and it's the only novel that Powers ever wrote. But the lesser known works are sometimes the most satisfying reads.<br />\\"In the Memory of the Forest\\" is a murder-mystery set in the small farming village of Jadowia, somewhere to the northeast of Warsaw. The book is skillfully written, with an interesting plot, a few twists here and there, and an ending that's both disturbing and reassuring. Poland's role in the Holocaust is the dark and provocative background for the novel. What I liked most about the book is that Powers (a former journalist who lived in Warsaw for five years) captures the personality of Poland better than other authors who have attempted this same task, e.g., James Michener, Lily Brett. My only complaint is that many of the characters are too clearly cast as \\"good guys\\" or \\"bad guys,\\" without a chance for them to surprise you with the other sides of their personalities. A Polish murder-mystery is a narrow genre, which most people wouldn't be inclined to read. But if you're daring enough to tackle those tricky Polish pronunciations, you'll probably be glad that you read this book.	2004-03-01

The pre-prologue, labeled \\"Fact:\\", may also cause some head-scratching among students of religious history. But I think the book can be best enjoyed by not taking it too seriously. After all, this is pop historical fiction, served up with intriguing plot twists, high-tech surveillance devices, charming little riddles, and a dash of sexual innuendo, all of which are played out by a cast of jet-set international cognoscenti.  James Bond meets the bible.<br />Chances are you've read, or are thinking about reading, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" because, well, everyone else is reading it. Whatever formula delivers popularity, which begets further popularity, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" certainly has it. And that could be the novel's strongest point.  It appeals to a wide audience and keeps readers captivated to the end.  That's the holy grail of this book.  It's easy to poke holes in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but treat it as a fun read for the bus ride home and you'll probably be glad that you read it.	2004-02-22

It's a place that will likely strike a chord with most every reader, regardless of where they grew up.  The characters here are interesting and find a way to be likeable despite their many flaws.  It's hard not to be swept in by the various storylines that ebb and flow throughout the novel.  In lesser hands, the petty rivalries and failed relationships of our protagonist, Donald Sullivan, aka &quot;Sully,&quot; wouldn't be so captivating.  But as any reader of Russo's novels knows, the author has a way with his characters.  Their dialogue is thoughtful and just witty enough not to be taken too seriously.  &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; takes you to Russo's world.  And when you're finished reading this book, it's hard not to feel the urge to return for another visit.	2004-02-16

Baseball fans will certainly enjoy the insider's perspective of the A's organization (e.g., why Hatteburg and Mabry were added to the team, why Art Howe was dumped). And non-fans should appreciate Lewis's folksy descriptions of the great American pastime, including both on-the-field and off-the-field anecdotes. My only quibble with \\"Moneyball\\" is that the book could benefit from an index, to help readers find references to important characters associated with the team. But that's just window dressing. There's plenty of meat to this well written story, proving that Michael Lewis, despite a couple of recent clunkers, hasn't lost his touch.	2004-01-20

That said, the novel isn't for everyone.  I found myself too bogged down by the quirky period dialogue and arcane nautical terms to derive much enjoyment out of this book.  To boot, the plot seems pretty thin (although things thicken up a bit towards the end).  I think it would be best to judge \\"Master and Commander\\" after reading several books in the series.  But after reading the first, I don't feel compelled to plow through any more.	2004-01-16

Biographers' tendency to succumb to Stockholm Syndrome is all too typical, particularly when the author is granted generous access to a charismatic subject and those who work for him.  (Read 'The New New Thing' by Michael Lewis for a case study of this unfortunate phenomenon.)  But Symonds manages to be reasonably balanced in this informative and entertaining portrait of Ellison and Oracle Corp.<br />The most interesting part of the book, to me, was the footnotes penned by Larry himself, a quid pro quo for the two years of access to Ellison's life that Symonds received.  Ellison is humorous, humble and scathingly disparaging of his enemies (heads up Gates and Siebel!) in hundreds of footnotes scattered throughout the book.  Sure, it's a bit frustrating that Larry always has the last word on controversial issues.  And his attempts to spin the story may turn your stomach at times.  But 'Softwar' would be a much drier read without Ellison's contributions.  Besides, you're always free to make up your own mind when Larry's version of reality comes across as a little too convenient.  At the end of the day, 'Softwar' may be the best Ellison bio out there, and a great read for folks who are interested in a classic American success story.	2003-12-30

The stories he tells in \\"Naked\\" are so outlandish that you'll wonder how a guy can make this stuff up. Of course, it's only partially made up. Sedaris's essays are autobiographical and the characters he describes are surely based on real people. It's all pretty funny. And if a story or two falls flat, don't worry -- the next one will probably be a winner. I enjoyed reading the book, and zipped through it in no time. My only quibbles are that the salty language is sometimes overdone (e.g., see pp. 154-5) and that the humor can get a little old. Too much Sedaris is exhausting. But \\"Naked\\" in small doses is ideal.	2003-12-11

Gore Vidal's 1987 epic makes for educational, if sometimes tedious, fireside reading.  'Empire' is a tough one to plow through in one sitting, let alone one month, but in the end it rewards the reader with an informative narration of turn-of-the-century America.  The fourth in Vidal's five-part series, 'Empire' features both historical and fictitious characters, who share the plot in equal dollops throughout the novel.  A cursory knowledge of early 20th-century American history -- McKinley, Roosevelt, Hay, etc. -- enhances the reading experience.  But even without this knowledge, the book is well worth the read.  The closing dialogue alone justifies the effort.	2003-12-01

Readers either love it or loathe it.  Count me in the latter category.  Nothing against the author.  I'm sure he achieved his objectives with flying colors.  And the subject matter is, at times, pretty darn interesting.  But Eco's style -- fraught with arcane references and interminable diatribes -- is not my cup of tea.  To boot, the explanation of the causes of the holocaust, albeit fictionalized, is disturbing, to put it mildly.  Here's a snippet of what I'm talking about:  'Hitler was searching the Jews for the clue that would allow him to determine, with the Pendulum, the exact point under the earth's concave vault where the telluric currents converged.'  (See pp. 422-3, et al.)<br />I regret that I plowed through the whole book, but I have an irrational habit of always finishing the books that I begin reading.  To the more rational reader, I suggest the following:  read the first six pages.  If it tickles your shorts, keep reading.  There's plenty more where that came from.  If not, cut bait and find something else to read.  Granted, there are many people for whom 'Foucault's Pendulum' is a brilliant piece of literature.  But for others, the book will only disappoint for many, many hours.	2003-03-22

Rather, the book is chock full of common sense, backed up with case studies from the world of successful -- and not so successful -- American businesses.  Although Grove wrote this book during the early days of the Internet bubble, he clearly did not get wrapped up in the all of the excitement of that era, much to his credit.  His thoughts are measured, sensible and coldly rational, as befits an industry titan and the ex-CEO of the most successful chip company on the planet.<br />If you haven't read this book, now is as good a time to do so as any.  Today's readers have the benefit of knowing how technology and business have evolved since \\"Only the Paranoid Survive\\" was published in 1996.  The seven years that have since elapsed reveal that Grove really knows what he's talking about.  His understanding of how the Internet would affect Intel underscores his management prescience.  And his skepticism regarding gee-whiz technological innovations like \\"Internet appliances\\" provides an interesting example of how Intel maintained its strategic focus, and emerged from the bubble as strong as ever.<br />\\"Only the Paranoid Survive\\" breaks no new ground in the business-management genre.  But the book is well written, well organized, and well worth the read for those who want a glimpse inside the mind of an incomparable American success story.	2003-03-03

Riordan does a good job of explaining the good guys' and the bad guys' motives.  And you'll probably be surprised by the unexpected revelations at the end.

Historical figures -- Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann -- are referenced frequently, but provide no dialogue in the novel.  The book's title refers to the address of the Jewish resistance headquarters, and the place of much of the action and confrontation in the latter half of the story.<br /><br />Like other Uris novels, &#34;Mila 18&#34; takes some energy to plow through. Given the gravity of the subject, it might be among the most difficult of his books to read. But the effort is well worthwhile. You'll not only be rewarded with powerful storytelling, but you'll also be awakened to one of the great struggles that occurred during the dark years of the 20th century. And Leon Uris will probably be remembered as one of the most important voices of this struggle.	2003-02-19

The author, Tim Cahill, displays a talent for free-spirited travel writing. And he does so without the cynicism that darkens the work of some of his peers.<br />Cahill's adventures take him to the four corners of the world: Africa, South America, Mexico, the mountains near his home in Montana. The essays cover a lot of ground. In addition, Cahill couples a keen storytelling ability with a helpful dash of research. This provides interesting background material for the landscapes and the cultures that he visits.<br />In the introduction, Cahill claims that he's not trying to be funny when he writes.  Yeah, right. He's definitely trying to be funny (unless he's become so good at it that he doesn't have to try anymore). The results are there to enjoy. But the best stories combine humor with more serious issues. These are the essays that demonstrate Cahill's versatility--and maturity--as a writer. And they also make \\"Hold the Enlightenment\\" a pleasant surprise for those hoping for more than another book of crazy derring-do.	2003-02-08

It's not that \\"Charming Billy\\" is a poorly written novel.  Far from it.  Alice McDermott is clearly a very strong writer whose prose and dialogue are finely crafted.  It's just that the storyline in this book seems to have so much promise, yet never really goes anywhere.<br />Our protagonist, Billy Lynch, loses his fianc&eacute;e to pneumonia and spends the rest of his life drinking himself to death to assuage his pain.  The book begins at his wake and then hip-hops around, filling in the blanks of his oh-so-melancholy life.  Sometimes it's difficult to keep track of all the characters in Billy's sprawling, Irish-American family.  But a few notes that I jotted down as I read the book definitely helped sort out all of the confusion.  Most of the characters are developed very nicely.  But some are glossed over, like the narrator (Billy's cousin's daughter) and a fellow named Danny Lynch (and how exactly is he related to Billy?).<br />If you enjoyed reading Frank McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" you might want to give \\"Charming Billy\\" a read.  It's well written, poignant, and surely has a message.  But if you're expecting a little (just a little) action, a plot twist here and there, or even a bona fide tear-jerker, this book may not be for you.  Despite its strong points, \\"Charming Billy,\\" just like the life of the book's hero, is not what it could have been.	2003-01-30

Readers who first encountered Proulx through \\"The Shipping News\\" will be pleased to discover that the author's knack for writing provocative and moving prose is alive and well in this 1996 novel.  The central theme--the struggle of immigrants to assimilate themselves into American society while maintaining ties with their native culture--will strike a chord with many readers.  The device used to explore this theme is a hand-made green accordion, brought to the US by an Italian immigrant in the 19th century.  The accordion changes hands numerous times, with each new owner spotlighted in a separate chapter of the book.<br />Fans of good writing will surely enjoy \\"Accordion Crimes.\\"  Most of the stories are dark and troubling.  And only a handful of the characters are meant to be likeable.  But the vivid storytelling will keep you turning the pages, as will the suspense of discovering the ultimate fate of the little green accordion ... and the treasure hidden inside of it.  Those who are squeamish may be put off by Proulx's gruesome means of killing off her characters:  suicide by chainsaw, electrocution by worm probe, being crushed under a collapsing cinder-block wall.  It's enough to make Stephen King blush.  In addition, the book is labeled as \\"a novel,\\" but it's perhaps more apt to consider it a collection of short stories.  As a result, character development and story lines are not as deep as they are in other Proulx novels.  Nonetheless, those who read this book will likely enjoy enough of the chapters to make the experience worthwhile.	2003-01-06

The plot moves rapidly, skipping from place to place as our old friend Jack Ryan frets over a bevy of global crises. This time the threat comes from Japan, where a jingoistic industrialist plots to bring America to its knees, both economically and militarily. \\"Debt of Honor\\" is enjoyable enough to read. The action moves fast and the chapters are sliced into convenient, bite-sized portions. The book's weakness, perhaps, is that the plot--and many of the sub-plots--seem a little far-fetched. E.g., Japan's invasion of Guam and Saipan goes undiscovered by the US press for several days, until an enterprising weatherman from Idaho unearths the shocking news. But Clancy's knack for explaining the technical aspects of airplanes, submarines, aircraft carriers, et al, is as good as ever.

The author describes the accomplishments and contradictions of his subject without undue criticism or commendation.  From his early years at Harvard and the NY state legislature, through the final days of his life, Roosevelt was passionate, opinionated and, above all, focused on achieving his goals.  Pringle describes these events in great detail, from the well known (the Spanish-American War, the Panama Canal, anti-trust efforts) to the more obscure (simplified spelling, the Venezuelan debt dispute, the ill-fated Progressive party).  After reading this book, you'll have a solid understanding not only of Roosevelt the man, but also of the world events that shaped history for the next hundred-plus years.<br />Pringle's book is enjoyable to read, in part because it includes numerous excerpts from TR's letters and speeches.  The intelligence and wit of Roosevelt's writing feel like a breath of fresh air in today's world of banal CNN sound bites.  You might be disappointed, however, by Pringle's lack of explanation for Roosevelt's controversial side.  Namely, TR's racism and imperialistic hankerings may seem at odds to how a US president should behave, even in turn-of-the-century America.  To boot, Pringle devotes only passing notice to the irony of TR's 1906 Nobel Peace Prize, a controversial accolade considering Roosevelt's jingoistic tendencies.  Although some may consider Pringle's \\"Theodore Roosevelt\\" to be a definitive reference book, I'd argue that this biography is an excellent introduction, which should be supplemented with other works that pursue TR's controversial side in greater detail.	2002-11-27

The protagonist, a WWII POW, is accused of spying for the Nazis and sentenced to 10 years of forced labor.  The story is at its best in the matter-of-fact approach by which Ivan Denisovich Shukhov describes a typical day.  The reader is not subjected to tales of brutality or beatings.  Even fears of the effects of countless days in a dehumanizing environment seem to take a back seat to the mundane challenges of daily life in the gulag.  Shukhov's description of meal time is a good example:  \\"... their bowl of hot and watery soup without any fat was like rain in a drought.  They gulped it down.  They cared more for this bowlful than freedom, or for their life in years gone by and years to come.\\"<br />Solzhenitsyn's message is clear.  Humility is easily stripped away under oppressive regimes, and survival becomes the end game.  Only the strongest can hope to retain their dignity, and even they will eventually lose that battle as the years go by.  \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" is a great intro to Russian literature, and a poignant account of post-war life in a Stalinist gulag.	2002-11-09

Readers will appreciate the tensions that existed during the post-war years and understand why compromise between scientists and political leaders was often elusive.  The lessons learned are as applicable today as they were half a century ago.  &quot;American Science in an Age of Anxiety&quot; is valuable reading for students of 20th century history, or anyone interested in learning how America dealt with internal challenges during contentious times.	2002-11-02
