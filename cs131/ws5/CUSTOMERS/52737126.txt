They profile similiar species in similar poses, very helpful.  It doesn't offer as many species as the RTP guides, but then RTP guides don't show photos.  I also suspect that the guide I have isn't as likely to handle weathering (mud/rain/etc) as well as the RTP bindings.	2003-07-11

If you come into this as a naturalist you will likely be disapointed. There are some other  serious problems that I was able to spot straight out.<br />Plate 40. &quot;Auger Shells&quot;  One of the 'augers' is not only NOT an auger and it's not even from the Carolinas at all.  It's the Common Vertagus (a certh) from the Indo-Pacific (likely from the Philippines).<br />Plate 54. &quot;Oyster Drills&quot;.  Contains several Murexes in addition to the drills.<br />Plate 59.  Sundials.  The figured Sundial is not The American Sundial (Architectonica nobilis) but rather the Clear Sundial (Architectonica perspectiva) also from the Indo-Pacific.<br />The substitution of shells from the other side of the world really shows sloppy work in this guide.  The other major problem I have with the book is that it just isn't complete enough; it only shows a small fraction of the plants and animals that one finds on Carolina coasts.  The naturalist who trys to depend on this book will likely be frustrated and will find that they need other guides.  As an introduction for a beginner it is ok, short the above noted plate problems.	2002-08-07

They are small for small hands, have general but limited information and decent color drawings.  You know a book is well received when it has continued to be printed for well over half a century!<br />I teach in a College and was surprised to see that they are still the book of choice for some Biology students who also grew up with them.  The only reason I don't give them 4 stars is the fact that much of the info is awfully dated.	2001-09-05

I used this book on a recent trip to San Francisco to figure out where we might like to hike.  It seemed fairly accurate.  It would have been nice if there was a little more informational content on wildlife or geology, but that's not what the book was all about.  The hikes we went on were't too crowded (save the Muir Woods) so I'd say the info was right on the mark.  McClure Beach was especially lovely and I doubt we would have gone there without the recommendation from the book.	2001-09-05

The trip left me hungry for more, so I hit the local Borders (I can say that now that Borders and Amazon have e-merged right?). There were two books that were a class in themselves ( I can't recall the name of the other book, rats!). In any rate, this book will not leave you short.

Because I was jumping into the position I was stuck using the text previously designed for the class.  Almost a third of the book was classical genetics, which I enjoy, but was certainly overplayed. Molecular Biology areas were a jumble of terms to learn and lists to inscribe into their brains.  The problems in the book did not reflect the material in the text, leaving the class pretty much upset with the book.  By midterm it was time to find another sources for the class.<br />I found myself reaching for other texts, and &quot;Genetics, Analysis and Principles&quot; turned out to be the jewel.  It is well balanced, very clearly written, and does not spend its time making students read long memory lists of genes or proteins that the class is going to forget less than two weeks after the term.  I think this is largely reflected  by the way he wrote the book; with input from students.<br />Reading the intro I was afraid that this text was going to be way over into the experimental design/ data side which I've seen in other texts mean &quot;no content&quot;. Not so this text; experimental design has been written into the book to describe genetics and content, not replace it.  I think what is truely unique about this book is the use of scientific process as a way to teach concepts.  I wish I had more books like this one for other courses.  I hope Dr. Brooker's format for Biology (and yes other science courses) is adopted for other courses.<br />If you are considering a text for your Genetics classes, I think you will be very pleased with this book.	2001-04-27

I was impressed by the photos of different marine mollusks in their native habitats, often engaged in complex feeding activities (especially note Colubraria feeding on a parrot fish through it's mucus bubble).  It's very nice to see, for a change, a book dedicated to the living organisms that we as Conchologists often tend to forget when engaging in this hobby. I have an extensive collection of shell books and would say to the best of my knowledge this book simply has some of the finest mollusk habitat photography of any book I've seen.  I wish they included a bit more text; I felt that a little more  info with those excellent photos this would have made this a classic text.  Instead it is a excellent book for the amature collector looking for more than the typical identification of shells book.  That maybe a mis-characterization as there was information in the text that was new to me (and I have been in this hobby for 30 years), but a lot of the text seemed 'wanting'.  Well worth a look see.	2000-11-29

As a first year molecular instructor I went looking for advice on textbooks.  Under recommendations from the previous instructor of this course I chose Weaver's book as an alternative to the now aging Albert Text.  Frankly, the text has been a flop.<br />Why?  Because it assumes a certain level of understanding of molecular coming into the course.  A highly motivated student who has a strong background in research will enjoy this book, but as a general text it just doesn't work well.  I find my students are just lost in the chapters.  They are getting bogged down trying to work through all the gels and are missing the concepts being presented. I find that I must use figures from Albert's or Stryer (Biochem) to make the concepts clear.  Perhaps  it would be a good grad textbook with a student population that has an excellent understanding of 'gel science'.<br />Mostly I find it is just missing in general concepts. They summarize sections up in little orange boxes at the end which seems to be all the class seems to understand from the readings.  I think they need to put more effort into making the general text more understandable to students by working on the model end and less on the experimental end.<br />I am not alone in my poor evaluation of this text.  A prof who has been teaching the class for 15 years finally made the switch to this book this year to replace Albert.  She gave up on Weaver two weeks into the class because of her class' fustration.<br />I would recommend this book ONLY to those who have first read it and feel it is going to be PERSONALLY useful.	2000-11-05

Mrs Andrew's Books are alaways a jewel.  I have the second printing of this book and have read through this one.  I admit I perfer the earlier editions; large books with lots of info, but you certainly wouldn't call them field guides.  This book is, and next to Abbot's large American Shells this is probably the most comprehensive regional guide to American Shells.<br />As a little side note as a kid I shelled most of east and central Texas beaches.  I became very familiar with the various species on the different beaches.  I did find a few odd shells further north than were listed in her book and some of the shells she lists as fairly common seem much less so to me (I told her as much so! :)) .
