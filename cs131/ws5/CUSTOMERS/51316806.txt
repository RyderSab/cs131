I did and I'm not even that fond of the noir genre.  Jack Taylor, the &quot;hero&quot;, is a man constantly battling (pretty much unsuccessfully)the bottle.  He is a very human protagonist with elements of many other P.I.'s--the intelligence vs. the addiction; the toughness vs. the sensitivity (poetry, books, etc.)and so on.  What sets this book apart in my view is its Irishness and it's easy readability.  It seems to me to capture the Irish character particularly well-- the dark, brooding, violence juxtiposed with the witty, sardonic fatalism.  It does help to know something about Ireland and the Irish because there are references and language you will miss if you don't.  However, it is not fatal to enjoying the book if you are new to all things Irish.  The writing style is spare and fast-moving and the hero, who is a disaster waiting to happen, some how very appealing.  I'm looking forward to reading my second Ken Bruen book.	2004-07-19

The book has an interesting but not really novel approach to the Anglo-Irish War in its discussion of the &quot;people's war&quot; aspect of it, i.e., a guerrilla war which enabled a small, under-armed, outmanned country to break free from the British Empire.This has been explored before and to greater effect and this book seems to spend a great deal of time on the 1916 rebellion with a rather cursory (the book has only 113 pages of text)review of the actual war of independence,  The author explains this by saying he didn't want to repeat what others had already covered extensively but a little more detail would have been better, or the book's title should have been revised.  The appendices were probably the best part of the book (including one on Irish Songs of Rebellion, a rather unusual addendum) but the indexing is sloppy.  Overall, a big disappointment, and certainly a poor choice for anyone not already well informed about that period of Irish history.	2004-04-24

The book is amusing and pretty well written, although the real Michael Collins probably deserves better.  At the very least he should not be said to look like Liam Neeson (who played him in the film &quot;Michael Collins&quot;) because he looked nothing like him. Maybe Brendan Gleeson (who also played him much more believably in &quot;The Treaty&quot;)but not Liam Neeson. At any rate, this book is of interest mainly because of its subject, not its literary value.	2003-11-28

The plot is, as usual, well crafted and interesting and the array of characters, both familiar and unfamiliar (including the culinarily-gifted grandson)engaging.  This is the book that bridges the gap between Gastner as under-sheriff and his new life and it does not disappoint. The New Mexico setting is also as fascinating as usual.  I do not understand the editorial criticism of the plot as slow-moving--I thought it one of Havill's best, most absorbing and exciting.

It was a vibrant town even in its declining days and even more remarkable during its heyday.  A town that was its own melting pot, it was uniquely free of prejudice.  Multiple nationalities, races and creeds lived in relative harmony and contributed to the unusual cohesion that was its trademark, probably due in large part to the danger inherent in the work done by the miners.  Every family lived with the fear of a catastrophic mine disaster (there were two big ones during Dawson's lifespan)and it tended to draw all its inhabitants together.<BR>    Smith has captured the essence of this wonderful little town and his interviews of ex-residents add to the immediacy of the events he recounts.  It is a fascinating account of a fascinating place.	2003-08-28

Gannon accurately reflects the upbringing in an Irish home where many things are left unsaid and much of family history is shrouded in mystery.  His trip to Ireland to learn more about his parents and his forebears is a treat--enlightening, educational and very funny.  It is also dead-on in its take on Ireland and the Irish.

He covers all the bases and then some, discussing in a very readable way the inconsistencies and contradictions in the Irish character, the dark and light side of a race never easy to understand, the stage Irishman, the myths and exaggerations bandied about with respect to the Irish, the warmth and humor, the anger and belligerence, the devotion to country that are hallmarks of the people.

The portraits that emerge of Irish revolutionary leaders, in particular Michael Collins, Eamon de Valera and Arthur Griffiths, are fascinating and revealing.  O'Hegarty is clearly a Michael Collins man and he provides several particularly interesting insights into the legendary rebel leader, including a description of how his (O'Hegarty\\"s) young child reacted to Collins.  Not a sweeping review of the era but an unusually intimate and perceptive slant on it.	2002-12-09

Ryle Dwyer (who also wrote \\"Big Fellow, Long Fellow\\")has written a study of Michael Collins that revolves primarily around his leadership of the war of independence against England and his interaction with his compatriots and competitors in that war.  Dwyer takes praticular interest in the rivalries and tensions among the leading characters in the conflict, especially those between Collins and De Valera and Cathal Brugh.  Collins is presented as a complex and charismatic man whose objective was independence for his country, not personal power, and who could charm and cajole, or terrorize and assassinate with equal effectiveness in pursuit of that goal.  It is a fascinating, intimate portrait of a man whose peersonality was central to the success of the independence fight, after 800 years of unsuccessful rebellions, and who, while he may not have single-handedly \\"won the war\\", was the one single factor without which the war would most likely NOT have been won.

It traces Collins' rise to prominence from his boyhood in nationalist Cork County through his ten years in England working for the post office and financial firms, his return to Ireland to participate in the Easter Rising of 1916, his increasing influence in Frongoch prison in Wales and in nationalist/republican circles upon his release in 1917.  This biography reads more like a riveting novel given the almost mythical qualities of the central character.  Coogan conveys not only the facts about Collins and his exploits during Ireland's fight for independence but also his charismatic personality, engaging wit and humor, capacity for ruthlessness, magnetic leadership qualities and passionate devotion to his country and its people.  This is also a fascinating  textbook picture of a successful guerilla war and intelligence operation led by a man with a genius for conspiracy, the so-called \\"Dublin Pimpernel\\", the most wanted man in the British Empire at that time. Highly recommended, particularly for anyone who would like to have a better understanding of the troubles in modern Ireland.	2002-02-20

As with most such fictional stories incorporating historical figures, it suffers from a rather forced, unreal feeling.  Basically, the launching device is the discovery of journals kept by a young woman (not an historical figure) who served as one of Collins' agents/assassins as well as his lover briefly, and more as well.  Sort of an Irish Nikita.  The story is interestingly, if melodramatically, written and holds your interest reasonably well if you are familiar with Irish history and the leading figures in the fight for freedom from Britain.  Otherwise, I imagine it would be rather heavy going.  Generally, I would say it is no worse and certainly no better than the usual historical novel with the added fillip of the speculation (pretty much laid to rest by Collins' best biographers) as to who fired the shot that killed him.	2001-09-27

The author had access to many of Collins' personal papers and he writes in an easy and easily understood manner.  The essential facts about the famous Irish revolutionary are there but there is much less detail than in more extensive biographies,not necessarily a bad thing. Overall, this account of Collins' life and exploits rings true and presents a picture of the real man and the incredible service he gave to Ireland during his short life.  It also gives a vivid picture of the great love and loyalty he inspired in his rag-tag band of  rebels, from whom he drew acts of bravery and devotion they themselves hardly realized they were capable of.  Highly recommended if you want to get a real feel for a critical period of Irish history and a man unique in any era.	2001-01-24

This biography, which was probably the most highly regarded until Tim Pat Coogan's momumental work, is still in my view one of the most readable and the one that perhaps catches the essence of its subject best, as the opening quotation indicates.  In this work Forester presents all the usual facts about Collins--his youth, his rise to prominence after the 1916 rising, his intelligence, his intensity, his personal courage, his love of country and comrade, his wit and warmth--but manages to add touches that bring out even more vividly the real character of this extraordinary man.  Thus, her descriptions of his interaction with children, whom he loved and who loved him; his identification with the ordinary people of Ireland and his affinity for old people; his iron self-control in  matters of personal indulgence; his refusal to disguise himself during the time he was the most wanted man in the British Empire; his often-brusque manner with women, which both affronted and intrigued them; his changes of mood &quot;as spectacular and unpredictable as the play of the Northern Lights&quot;; and his ability to inspire trust, love, and loyalty in the many people who worked for and with him. This is a vivid biography of a young man who was both realist and idealist and who led his country to its first taste of real freedom in 700 years.	2000-12-30

Written by a man who was an intimate of Michael Collins and a trusted conspiratorial comrade in the struggle against England, it has fascinating details about the day-to-day operations of a guerrilla war and the nervewracking lifestyle of the on-the-run participants.  Beaslai, although a close friend and admirer of Collins, nonetheless gives a relatively objective picture of the man and his leadership, and this account, more than any other I have read, reflects the perspective and immediacy of a real participant in the history-making events it recounts.  This sets it apart and makes it a highly recommended read for anyone truly interested in Irish history.	2000-12-30

While not fully developed, these biographical accounts give an insight into the conflicts of men and ideas involved in Ireland's fight for freedom from Britain.  The first three men were, of course, leaders in the War of Independence:  Collins the guerrilla leader who, more than any single man, was responsible for the creation of the Irish Free State; De Valera the austere leader who oversaw the Free State's emergence as the Republic of today and led Ireland through much of the 20th century; and Griffith the intellectual founder of Sinn Fein, the philosophy and the party. The remaining leader, James Craig, the inflexible voice of Ulster unionism and opposition to bringing the six northern counties into the Free State, is shown as an astute defender of the status quo and manipulator of the British to that end.

It succeeds in bringing out both the &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; sides of Collins and painting a picture of a man whose tremendous love of his country and burning desire to free it from English rule brought him to the fore during a harrowing time in Irish history.  The descriptions of Collins' interaction with his comrades, his charismatic personality, his unique qualities of wit, compassion, intelligence and ruthless audacity combine to bring to life one of history's most intriguing revolutionary leaders.

The author is clearly an admirer of Collins but the portrayal appears to be objective and covers all the biographical bases in Collins' life--the Irish childhood and indoctrination with nationalist ideals from family and teachers; the years between 15-25 working in London; the participation in the Easter Rebellion and imprisonment in Wales; the return to Ireland and rise to leadership in the War of Independence; and the transformation to statesman in the Treaty negotiations.  What Mackay particularly brings to the portrait of Collins is a warmth that allows the reader to see the real man behind the legend--the interactions with the men and women who shared his struggle or who opposed him, and the reaction of his countrymen to his leadership and to his untimely death during the bitter Civil War at the hands of former comrades who in many cases still revered him.

While not as detailed or as exhaustively researched as other books on the two men, it is of particular interest because it presents them together and explores the contrasts between them which ultimately led to their split and the devastating civil war in Ireland, which was more tragic by far  than the war against Britain.  The theory of the book is that the difference in the background and upbringing of the two accounts for the eventual animosity between them--DeValera, the cold, reserved, patriotic and manipulative  product of a dislocated and not very secure childhood, and Collins, the much-loved youngest child in a large, cohesive family, whose volatile, intelligent, charismatic personality created both enemies and almost fanatically loyal adherents.  The contrasts are engrossing and illuminating, and the book is well worth reading to understand the dynamics behind the Irish War of Independence.	2000-10-26

All the aspects are fascinating and the individual essays are well written as well as very balanced, for the most part.  The collection appears to be an attempt--generally successful--to put into perspective a man and a life that have been alternately obscured by deliberate attempts to keep his accomplishments in the shadows, over-idealized by admirers attempting to rectify the former, or simply distorted by being too closely linked to the wrenching times in which he lived.

It is by far the most detailed and best researched of the numerous works on Collins and it gives such a vivid picture of his complex personality that you feel you really know him by the end of it.  All the facts of his life are there--the youthful years; the years in London working as a postal clerk and apprentice in investment houses; the participation in the 1916 rebellion and subsequent imprisonment, when he first rose to prominance in rebel circles; the harrowing years &quot;on the run&quot; as the mastermind behind the guerilla war of independence; and finally the years of the treaty negotiations and the civil war which led to his death.  In addition, the descriptions of Collins' character, including flaws, are fascinating in showing a man of extraordinary intelligence, great charisma for both men and women, an almost obsessive love of his country and its people, great wit and humor, unrepentant ruthlessness in dealing with those spies and informants who threatened the cause, and a tremendous compassion and regard for his comrades, even when they became his adversaries in the civil war.  For anyone who is interested in Ireland and its past, for anyone who wants to read about a man whose real life exploits were more riveting than fiction, this biography of the rough country boy with a limited formal education who became the most wanted man in the British Empire and then held his own in treaty negotiations with  the most formidable statesmen in that Empire, is a must-read.	2000-10-01

Even more important are the allegations that Collins  was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy between members of his own  government (particularly Kevin O'Higgins, Emmet Dalton and William  Cosgrave)and the British and that members of the Irish Republican  Brotherhood (Collins' main base of power) were involved on all sides. These  contentions fly in the face of much that has been written about Collins and  are not documented in any of the usual ways, thus raising questions about  their reliability in the reader's mind.	2000-05-18

I found the  cutsey &quot;Irish&quot; dialogue to be cloying and the perfection of the  heroine, gushingly described at every opportunity, to be not only  unbelievable but irritating.  Both of these flaws interfered with the  smooth flow of the story, which, without them, would have been pretty  engrossing.	2000-04-07

It is hard to read these letters and understand where  your editorial reviewer gets the idea that Collins was  &quot;vainglorious&quot; or &quot;petty&quot;  (was he/she perhaps thinking  of DeValera?).  Collins certainly had his faults but these were not among  them and certainly are not reflected in these letters.  Rather, we see a  man tormented by the burden laid on him in trying to end the 700-year  oppression by the British and save his country from the terrible civil war  that ensued after the signing of the Treaty.  These letters are fascinating  in their revelations of both Collins' character and that of Kitty Kiernan,  who comes across as rather shallow or at least uncomprehending of the  terrific strain under which Collins labored.  These are a must-read for  anyone fascinated with Michael Collins and that era of Irish history.	2000-04-01

The book is written in a  novelistic style that can sometimes be rather offputting, but it is  nonetheless an intriguing view of the most charismatic and, probably, most  effective Irish leader ever.  Certainly it reveals the great regard in  which Collins was, and is, held by his countrymen, even those who did not  support him after the Treaty which precipitated the civil war(which Ireland  seems only now to be putting behind it).Anyone interested in Michael  Collins and the tremendous impact he had on his country should read this  book.	2000-04-01
