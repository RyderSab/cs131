A more nearly accurate title would have been \\"A History of the western Christian church.\\"  Johnson writes as though the Orthodox church had never developed.  This is not a fault, but readers should be warned at the beginning. <br /> <br />On the positive side, he describes in some detail the pre-Latin churches, whose existence has been glossed over by the modern  establishment, e.g. the Montanists and the clashing sects of North Africa.  Some of their views compare quite favorably with the stodgy Latin dogmas.  These chapters are some of the most enthralling. <br /> <br />The book is indeed written for the literate layman such as myself, but it contains a treasure trove of information; Johnson is no one's toady, in spite of the ad hominem attacks on his personal life. <br /> <br />It does not begin exactly where his \\"History of the Jews\\" ends, and the latter is considerably more interesting than the former. <br /> <br />I need say no more; the previous, excellent reviewer has said it well.	2005-02-18

They do not have to; they KNOW. <br /> <br />More informed people read the book and are horrified, as should we all be, as we are when we read about the Inquisition.  The difference is that the Inquisition is at a safe chronological distance, while this book is uncomfortably close to us. <br /> <br />Dedijer's research is impeccable, as are his credentials.  The events described were widely known before the book was written, but a shame-faced newer generation of ecclesiastics prefers to suppress any Nazi connection.  The shame-facedness is good, the suppression is not.  The book is necessary. <br /> <br />The book is necessary in order partially to understand the intense hatred between Serbs and Croats and hence some of the events that are shaking that part of the world today.  It is necessary to understand history, e.g. the Latin church's desire to keep Croatia catholic as a buffer between Rome and the Orthodox churches.  It is necessary to a better understanding of the Latin church. <br /> <br />Heavy and distasteful reading, as bad as a detailed book about Auschwitz.

The title I have chosen is a quotation from Ingersoll that lost him a teaching job in Illinois because the seminary students to whom he said it in answer to a question they asked reported it to the school's principal.  His speeches and writings are full of  barbs like this that can have an audience in stitches, and it is no wonder that he was paid as much as $5,000 (in the ninetheenth century) to speak to thousands of delighted people. <br /> <br />After his aborted teaching career he married a fine and affluent woman who shared his views. They moved to New York and Ingersoll devoted the rest of his life to writing and to public speaking.   <br /> <br />It is not easy to dislike this man, even if one disagrees with him, because his best is hilarious and always on the mark.  America's Great Agnostic expressed himself with clarity and always with the compassion that some of his Christian critics lacked. Witness the debates between him and the Reverend Talmadge, which have appeared in print. <br /> <br />Ingersoll loved children, and only when he criticized religious teachings designed to terrify children into trembling piety did he become indignant and acerbic.  Otherwise, he spoke of religion with rollicking humor. <br /> <br />Perhaps the best way to appreciate him is to read an entire, short text, such as \\"Some mistakes of Moses.\\"  Single quotations may not do him justice.   <br /> <br />He died in 1899, but his ashes were kept in New York because they were not allowed interment in Arlington National Cemetery until 1932.  I have visited his grave, and the stone does not bear a cross, as most do--a breath of clean air in a country now sinking into the dark ignorance of the religious right. <br /> <br />We need more of Robert Ingersoll.  Read his works and roar with laughter along with him.	2005-02-16

From the introduction:  \\"...follows the tradition of the Spoken Language Series, prepared under the auspices of the American Council of Learned Societies during World War II, but it also takes advantage of more recent pedagogic theory.\\"  The original series was developed to teach languages to soldiers fast.  This course is designed for speaking Hungarian, not for reading. <br /> <br />Lessons begin with a five to six page conversation, Hungarian on the left, English on the right. The recording speaks the Hungarian and gives pause for repetition.  Sentences are built word by word or phrase by phrase, then the sentence is read at normal speed.  Only when the student has mastered this, can cover the Hungarian and give the English and vice versa does the lesson procede to pronunciation exercises (many are needed for Hungarian). <br /> <br />There follows the meat of the course, the exercises that make the student fluent in each point of grammar covered.  The speaker says sentences in the affirmaltive, the students says it back in the negative, the the speaker says the sentence correctly, and so one with each point of grammar covered.  Only when the student can do these easily does the course pass on to \\"narratives,\\" half-page all-hungarian lreadings using all prelvious material studied.   <br /> <br />This is the audio-lingual method and is still used by the State Department to teach languages to its staff. <br /> <br />The price is high, and Amazon appears to offer only the first of two volumes-the second covers lessons thirteen to twenty-four.  However, the second volume and tapes can be found through [...] <br /> <br />The Foreign Service Institute has also published an enormous Humgarian reader-more that 400 pages-, and the Army's original Spoken Hungarian may still be available from Spoken Language Services, although its language pre-dates the communist government and is therefore outdated. <br /> <br />My personal favorite is \\"Learn Hungarian,\\" published in Hungary but available in this country, with cassettes.

How do we acquire knowledge?  The only means we have is reason, because it is self correcting.  Faith, on the other hand, is not a reliable means of acquiring knowledge because it provides no means of distinguishing truth from untruth. <br /> <br />If one believed in the demon theory of disease, one would  be skeptical when Louis Pasteur's discovery of germs led to the hypothesis that killing them would cure disease.  But if many physicians put this hypothesis to the test and found it to be true, then one would be obliged to change one's belief. <br /> <br />This is reason. <br /> <br />If one believed that God hand crafted every being, and then fossils were found in layers that tended to show that the theory of gradual evolution might be true, and if one dismissed this evidence, saying that God put the fossils there to test one's faith, this would abdicate reason. <br /> <br />This is faith. <br /> <br />Faith can make us paint ourselves into a corner. If evidence appears that shows us to be wrong. then we must justify our beliefs with outrageous explanations.  Look at the traditional proofs for the existence of God:  They collapse under their own weight. <br /> <br />Rationalists, too, believe wrong things, but they are willing to change their minds in the face of new evidence. This self correction is the only reliable way that humanity has to acquire new knowledge. <br /> <br />There may be a god or gods, but the test of reason requires evidence.

Jochanan Kapliwatzky taught Arabic and other Semitic subjects in Vienna and Berlin in the 1920's and 1930's.  In Israel he wrote a series of books, one of which is the present title for English speakers who wish to learn Modern Standard Arabic.  I have been told that it is intended for middle-school students, and the pace of presentation bears this out.  Mastery of the first volume takes the student to approximately half or less of a college level semester, but mastery of all four would be a feat to admire.  True, his knowledge of colloquial English failed him when he used some words that are ambiguous and probably caused middle school pupils to titter, but this a charming quirk rather than a defect. <br /> <br />It is published in four hard bound volumes of 100-150 pages each, with an accompanying brochure-sized key to exercises for volume one.  The author states in the introduction that he wishes to avoid overly complex explanations and to make Arabic grammar accessible to everyone.  In this, I believe, he has succeeded. <br /> <br />My edition was published in 1959, cost a modest $16.00, and the four blue volumes occupy a place of honor in my library.  I love the book for the beauty of its Arabic font, the copious vocabulary, the many exercises and readings that reinforce what has already been studied, and the thorough coverage of the language's grammar. <br /> <br />Alas, this title appears to be out of print, and searches on second-hand dealers' sites such as [...] have turned up several copies of volume one, and one of volume four, both at outrageous prices. Lucky is the student who finds the whole set at a reasonable price. <br /> <br />There are alternatives.  One might look at the following: <br /> <br />\\"A New Arabic grammar of the written language\\" by Haywood and Nahmad, published by the Harvard University Press. <br /> <br />\\"Modern literary Arabic\\" by David Cowan, published by the Cambridge University Press. <br /> <br />\\"Arabic\\" by A.

The book appears to have been written by someone who has never taught a language and does not know what learning tools a student needs.  Worst is  the supposition that a brief introduction to the writing system makes any  transliteration unnecessary.  It requires that the student contend  simultaneously  with an unfamiliar alphabet, a deluge of grammatical rules,  and in some lessons as many as two or three pages of new words, all with  too few exercises to reinforce any of it.  From the learner's point of  view, this book is a disaster.     This is not a self teaching book nor a  book for beginners, and the cassettes add precious little to it.    Arabic  has a complex but regular and predictable structure.  Once one knows the  rules, progress comes fast.  The deficiencies of this book, however, make  learning far more difficult that it needs to be.  The only positive thing I  can say  is that the book might be useful as a review text during vacation  for a student who has completed one year of university-level Arabic     The  beginner would do well to consider \\"Modern Literary Arabic,\\"  listed in the Amazon database.

It is remarkable that students of Amharic have such an  excellent course available for such a relatively rarely-studied language.   <br />Dialogues are in Amharic script, transliteration and English.  Words and  sentences are spoken on the cassettes, with space for repetition and this  provides maximum opportunity for acquiring good pronunciation.  Abundant  exercises--also recorded--follow each dialogue, giving the student the  opportunity to practice aloud each point of grammar until he/she can use it  fluently.  The methodology makes learning this complex language enjoyable,  especially as the student advances.<br />This is a large and expensive course  for a very intricate language, and it is well worth the price.  It does,  however, presuppose a committment to hard labor for a long time.  Many  students have an entirely justifiable need for an elementary knowledge of  Amharic without the depth and without the expenditure of money, labor and  time that &quot;Amharic Basic Course&quot; requires.

Use this  comprehensive grammar as a supplement and as a reference for times when  standard textbooks leave doubts.	2000-08-02

This is listed as out of print, and perhaps it is, but I got it by mail from the publisher (Indiana University) and the tapes were available also by mail from the Indiana University Language and Computer Laboratories  Audio Tape Library.  It is by far the best learning tool for Finnish  currently available.  A good second is the book and recordings used by the  Foreign Service Institute and available from the Department of Commerce  through their NTIS series.  Both courses use the same methodology (I own  both), and they are effective and enjoyable to use.  <br />Lehtinen provides  conversations and ample exercises, all reproduced in the book and recorded  on the cassettes, and it explains grammar and Finnish sound changes  clearly. It explains important aspects of pronunciation that I have not  found in any other Finnish textbook, such as the occurrence of the glottal  stop, which is pronounced but never written.  The Foreign Service Institute  course does equally well but is oriented toward the needs of State  Department personnel.<br />Other Finnish courses on the market are less than  this (I own most of them too), and considering the complexity of Finnish  they are just not up to the job.	2000-08-01

This book presents a small amount of elementary Finnish, and it suffers the ills of small courses: not enough explanation of grammar, not enough exercises, not enough reading, not enough sound recording.  It is visually  attractive--but is that enough?<br />Finnish is a complex language with  exacting pronunciation, complex grammar, and an extensive network of  internal sound changes that must be explained clearly and completely.  The  student cannot assimilate these structures without reinforcement from  exercises and readings.  None of these elements are sufficiently provided  in this book.<br />Compare this poverty of resources with the very fine course  by Meri Lehtinen (books and recordings published by Indiana University) and  with the two second-best runners up, the Foreign Service Institute's  Finnish course, also with book and recordings, and &quot;Finnish for  Foreigners,&quot; (books and recordings) published in Finland but widely  available in the English-speaking world.	2000-08-01

This is one of the courses produced during World War II, when the U.S. government hired the best linguists of the day to turn out courses that would teach languages to soldiers fast.  It uses the same methodology now  used to teach languages to U.S. diplomats.  Some of the courses have become  dated, but this one is still among the best.<br />Used with the cassette  recordings, the student learns Dutch grammar and very good pronunciation.   It is both effective and enjoyable.  One caveat:  The book and recordings  cover only the first twelve of thirty lessons, and the second book may be  out of print, although copies can be found in libraries.  Students who have  begun Dutch know how tricky pronunciation can be, and this course's  contribution in this respect alone makes it worthwhile.	2000-08-01

The &quot;Colloquial&quot; series is very uneven in quality, and this is one of its poorer  examples.  It suffers the deficiencies of most Persian grammars available in English:  too little of everything.  Too little  grammar, too little vocabulary, too few exercises, too little recorded on  the cassette.<br />For good Persian learning materials see  &quot;Introduction to Persian&quot; by Wheeler Thackston, &quot;Persian  Grammar&quot; by Ann Lambton, and &quot;Spoken Persian&quot; by Serge  Obolensky.	2000-07-31

The &quot;Colloquial Series&quot; is uneven in quality, but this is one of its better examples.  Its only faults are those built into the series itself:  too few exersises, too little reading, too little material  recorded on the cassettes.  It does a creditable job of explaining Finnish  grammar and the language's most exasperating aspect, the many sound changes  that bedevil non-Finnish students.  It is a well-written book, and if  removed from the constraints of this series it could be made into an  outstanding learning tool.  <br />The best course available is that by Meri  Lehtinen published by Indiana University.  It gives ample explanations and  exercises for fluency and pronunciation.  I got the book and recordings  from the University and I believe that it is still available from that  source.  Also good is the Foreign Service Institute course, book and  recordings available from the Department Of Commerce NTIS series (contact  the Dept. of Commerce).  &quot;Finnish for Foreigners,&quot; published in  Finland, provides good explanations of grammar and sound changes, but would  be better if it gave more exercises for practice.	2000-07-31

This is one of the Spoken Language Series, which began during the Second World War when the U.S. government hired the best linguists of the day to produce courses that would teach languages to soldiers fast.  It is the  same method used to teach languages to U.S. diplomats today.<br />The book  presents colloquial, everyday language and teaches forms that appear only  in conversation.  It is not as useful for learning reading.  It is an  effective and very enjoyable way to learn languages.<br />However, the student  should also consider Wheeler Thackston's &quot;Introduction to  Persian,&quot; which is more recent, and  has, in my opinion, caused  &quot;Spoken Persian&quot; to drop to second place.  Thackston has nine  sound cassettes available--if not from the book dealer, then from the  publisher (that is where I got them); it teaches spoken and written  Persian, lacks the defects of previous textbooks, and is more thorough,  effective and enjoyable than any of its rivals.	2000-07-27

This is a tourist phrase book pure and simple, but when it is offered online, and cannot be previewed, the title is apallingly misleading.  It presents words and phrases in various categories, with Persian script,  transliteration and English equivalent, as any good phrase book should.  It  will be of use to travelers and it can be used for additional vocabulary  and examples of colloquial language by students who have mastered the  elementary level of Persian.<br />Sudents who want to learn Persian should  look at the books by Wheeler Thackston, Serge Obelinsky, and Ann Lambton.	2000-07-26

Ann Lambton's grammar is the standard in English, and its status is well deserved.  However, it was written for scholars of Persian language and literature.  The second half covers Arabic grammar as it is used in  literary Persian, and there is a companion volume of vocabulary for the  exercises.  If the student wants to do research in Persian, this is the  book to use.  <br />Those who  want to learn modern spoken and written Persian  but do not plan a life of scholarly research should look at the book by  Wheeler Thackston or at the second-best &quot;Spoken Persian&quot; (one of  the Spoken Language Series).  Both have sound recordings for pronunciation  and both will prepare the student for conversation, newspapers and modern  literature.	2000-07-24

This book is a fine little reference grammar, but it is not best suited as the beginner's primary learning tool, and it is because the book is presented in the &quot;Teach Yourself&quot; series that I give it only one  star.  The exercises are insufficient, and one is left with many  grammatical explanations and lists of words that one would very much like  to reinforce by reading and writing but cannot.  <br />It does have the virtue  of providing transliteration in most grammatical examples and it provides a  key to the exercises for self correction.  There is a master vocabulary  with transliteration in the back.  Explanations of grammar and of sound  changes are detailed, and the book is interesting to experienced language  learners, especially those who have some formal background in linguistics.   It is a well-written little book, but as a textbook for self-teaching it  compares unfavorably with other titles.  <br />For the contemporary language  see the fine grammar by Wheeler Thackston (it has sound recordings), and  for a scholarly approach  see Ann Lambton's grammar, a standard in the  field.	2000-07-24

For students above the elementary level, this book will clear up doubts left by other textbooks and explain points that never appear in them.  In fact, the more French the student knows the more useful this book will be.   It is cherished by advanced students as well as by teachers--I have been a  teacher of French.  This is one of those books that address points that are  simply not mentioned in standard courses.  If you have learned to love the  French language but are not sure which nouns end in consonants that must be  pronounced or you have other niggling, gnawing doubts that spoil your  enjoyment of the language, buy this book.  You too will love it.	2000-07-21
