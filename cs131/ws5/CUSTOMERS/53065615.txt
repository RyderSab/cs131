One thing hasn't any relationship with the other: not reminding the traditional Catholic teaching about the issue, he seems to forget that even the Pope, outside the strict limits of his infallibility - ex cathedra teachings about faith and morals - is also subjected to error and sin and effectively can err and sin. We can quote the historical examples of Liberius, Honorius or John XXII. So despite their misdeeds and wrongs, Paul VI - probably, the worst Pope the Church ever had in twenty centuries - was a reliable Pope, and John Paul II - not a Saint Pius X at all - is a legitimate Pope. Thanks to the Holy Spirit, they never mixed their infallibility with their errors.<br /> Otherwise, the book is quite interesting and traces a fairly balanced and accurate history of the Catholic traditionalist movement and its opposition to the post-conciliar Church: successively, Griff Ruby presents to the reader the sedevacantist tendency, represented essentially by the so-called &quot;Thuc line&quot; evolving around the CMRI and the SSPV (sedevacantist dissidents from the SSPX); the SSPX, the biggest and largely major group, balancing between the resistance to the modernist assault and the obedience in legitimate matters to the formal authorities of the Church; and finally the indult crowd, that established a reasonably sucessful non-aggression pact with the modernist Rome, composed by the FSSP, the Institute Christ the King and the brazilian Saint John Mary Vianney Apostolic Administration, whose members are usually known as the &quot;Fathers of Campos&quot;, and other minor groups.<br /> Two chapters deserve an especial attention from the reader: the one dedicated to prove the total contradiction that exists between the teachings of the pre-conciliar and post-conciliar Popes on several issues - liturgical innovation, freedom of religion and ecumenism, for example -, a chapter correctly named &quot;The Pope condemns Vatican II&quot;; the other enunciating the measures the author sustains as necessary to surpass the modernist crisis, which are generally shared by all the traditionalists: 1st) The total restoration of the Tridentine Mass; 2nd) The revocation of the Second Vatican Council. Highly original is the propose to concede a transitory indult to the New Mass of Paul VI, in order to allow an entire generation of Catholics that haven't ever known the Tridentine Mass (with the exception of those ones that frequented the traditional chapels and churchs) to take a quiet first contact with the perpetual and irrevocable latin-gregorian rite, the most beautiful thing this side of the heaven.<br /> In conclusion, this a quite interesting book, but must be read cautiously, considering the sedevacantist tendencies shown by its author.	2003-05-24

Scruple, a disorder that makes those whom suffer from it to perceive sin where is no sin at all or mortal sin where is just venial sin, continues to affect an uncountable number of Catholics, despite the moral decline of the modern world, leading frequently to situations of great moral despair and anxiety that impeach the normal increasing of the faith and also an healthy religious life.<br />The book is really very good and its author gives complete and clear answers to all the questions that surround this matter, always with great comprehension but never compromising the doctrine of the Church or falling in moral laxism. In fact, he follows a complete traditional line based on Saint Ignatius Loyolas and Saint Alphonsus Liguoris teachings, but, as the author reminds us, sometimes we take for traditional what it is not traditional at all, forgetting what is really<br />Concluding, I highly recommend this book, which will certainly clarify many doubts about this subject.	2003-05-22

About communion, the rule should be communion on the tongue, and not communion in the hand, but nowadays the contrary is turned into an almost compulsive truth (it is even possible to communicate in the hand in Saint Peters in Rome, against the own papal wish!).<br />Although the author clearly asserts that not everybody which communicate in the hand do that with disrespectful or evil purposes, the truth is plainly simple: communion in the hand constitutes an irreverence towards the sacred hosts that highly decreases the belief in the Real Presence of Christ on them.<br />It is also true that communion in the hand was a practice tolerated by the Church during her first centuries of existence; nevertheless, around the 10th century, the Church in her wisdom forbade such use, in order to prevent the serious misdeeds that it generated, mainly the dispersion of the sacred particles, but also to fight against the heretic behaviour that recurs to communion in the hand as a way to demonstrate its disbelief about the Real Presence. So, actually, it makes no sense to reintroduce such practice, and its effective reintroduction has given place to the rebirth of the abuses that once the Church intended to prevent.<br />Unfortunately, in the current times, it is only possible to communicate in the proper way and reverently - on the tongue and kneeling - in the traditionalist chapels, mainly directed by the SSPX.	2003-05-22

The solution proposed by Michael Davies is the only one will allow to give back to the Church a climate of normalcy, ending with the abuses that happened during the post-conciliar years: the fight for the Tridentine Mass, the Mass that refuses to die, and its total restoration all over the Catholic world.<br />Great book, easily readable and highly informative.	2003-05-22

Expelled from his diocese nothing less than five times, he escaped at least one murder attempt, travelled across the known world of his time from Alexandria to Germany (he introduced monasticism to the Western Church), from the Libyan desert to Rome, and ordained not only priests outside his diocese but also consacrated several bishops faithful to the authentic doctrine of the Church. In the defence of Catholicism, he even challenged without hesitation Pope Liberius, which answered him with an unfair excommunication.<br />He died in 373 and a few years later, the heresy he had fought so vigorously across his lifetime vanished.<br />Saint Athanasius is now acclaimed as a champion of the Roman Catholic Orthodoxy and one of the few saints that have the right to be labelled as \\"the Great\\". He is undoubtedly a role-model for our times and for those whom insist in the defence of the Catholic Faith nowadays.	2003-05-22

Saint Alphonsus Liguori analyses with great detail and precision, but always using a perfectly clear language, the decisive role of Saint Mary in the salvation of human souls and her essential contribution to keep them away from sin and eternal condemnation.

In fact, the present situation is even worse than in the time of Belloc, reference media being a mere repetition of each other. Despite the fact they present themselves with different editorial statutes, they always agree in the same essential matters - party system oligarchy, one-worldism, multiculturalism, free immigration and the consequent forced integration -, astonishingly remembering the media of a totalitarian society like the former Soviet Union.<br />How can we surpass this situation? In this point, Belloc's message is also actual: having recourse to independent or free media not dominated by plutocratic interests, in order to obtain a clearer vision about the events going on the world, complementing the information received from mainstream media or, even, giving that one such mainstream media have hidden. Despite some weaknesses that independent media also suffer, to those who turn to them, a complex whole of events will become perfectly understandable or, at least, much more clear, fighting in that way the occult censorship imposed on and by mainstream media (and, today, we have the internet, a tool unimaginable in the time of Belloc, that is the paradise of free media).	2002-12-23

I don't think so: any catholic with an average knowledge of his faith will be able to read this book without problems and profitably, in order to understand why the New Mass is not a good Mass.	2002-12-23

On the contrary, in a time of generalized apostasy, he just fulfilled his duties of Archbishop, refusing the changement of Catholicism in a religious syncretism, which maintaining an external catholic appearance, intends to cross and to conciliate it with heretic protestantism, masonic moral relativism and marxist political demagogy, in order to form a new (false) religion that catchs the so-called \\"spirit of Vatican II\\".<br /> Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre was undoubtedly a great figure of the Catholic Church in the second half of the 20th century: thanks to his almost unique efforts, orthodox Roman Catholic doctrine and pratice didn't vanished from our world, very especially, the beautiful tridentine mass.<br /> This book should be read by every catholic concerned with his Church, in order to understand Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in his own words, full of plain common sense.	2002-12-19

It is possible to see that everywhere across the western world in such fields as criminal law, labour law, health care, education, immigration, economic interventionism against free market and so on.<br />The book constitutes a good introduction to those ones interested to have a first contact with Sowell's thought; to the others already familiarized with the intellectual works of that author, its reading becomes a bit repetitive, but never loses interest.	2002-11-23

Against such states of things, Hildebrand prescribes the role-models of Saint Athanasius and Saint Pius X.<br /> The book is absolutely excellent and its essays, all of them, are unlosable precious gems. Nevertheless, I would detach, for example, &quot;The Case for the Latin Mass&quot;, a passionate praise of the eternal Tridentine Mass; &quot;The Illusion of Progress&quot;, where modernism, a variant of leftism inside the religious field, is exposed in its true colours; finally, &quot;The Institutional Church and Institutionalism&quot; and &quot;Belief and Obedience: The Critical Difference&quot;, pieces that today can only be read as ahead of time defenses of the great Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.<br /> Great, great, great: definitively, a must read book!	2002-11-22

Unhappily, a great number of europeans hasn't the same luck: the pattern described by Tammy Bruce in her book is similar to the one happening in Europe, but here the leftist revolution is more evoluted, thanks to the legislative acts approved by the left wing governments; in many european countries, my own included, is almost impossible to oppose leftist dogmas - very especially, everything concerning racial issues - without incuring in the risk of a judicial prossecution that can led to a severe fine or, even, a prision term...<br />Concluding, leftist ideology is undoubtly the worse enemy that real freedom has inside the western societies: it was like that on the past; it is nowadays, and the author clearly proves it.	2002-10-21

I say former seminaries because actually they are, with few honourable exceptions, everything but catholics: inside them, the way to priesthood is sistematicly barred to orthodox catholic and straight candidates (don't wonder never more with the priest shortage or the pedophile scandals...), traditional catholic doctrine is mocked and even some of the most sacred catholic dogmas are fought and contradicted (a single example: the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist is denyed!), papal magisterium about faith and moral issues is intentionally ignored and every heterodox non-catholic teaching is promoted up.<br />Now, you don't have to be surprised any more with the extravagant religious practices of some priests or, even, with their personal behaviour: they are obviously the final product of the afore mentioned system.<br />I also know that the subject analysed in Michael S. Rose's book is the state of the american catholic seminaries; not the situation of the catholic seminaries across the world. Nevertheless, once again, as my own personal experience says to me, the pattern described is also appliable, with the exclusion of the strong [homosexual] subculture, at least, to those ones located in Western Europe, once again with honourable exceptions.<br />Concluding, this book is an excellent cry of alarm against a shameful situation: if you are a traditional orthodox catholic, it doesn't tell you any thing new,  just confirming what you already knew from other sources; if you are not, but at least you are concerned with your Church, it is time to open your eyes with its reading.	2002-10-21

After its reading, nobody will ever face the Holy Mass the same way again, having understood what truly happens there: the bloodless renovation of Christ's sacrifice in favour of a sinful mankind.

Highly recommend for real catholics!<br />A final note: the author, Father Martin von Cochem, lived during the second half of the 17th century and the first quarter of the 18th century, much before the disastrous Second Vatican Council; the Mass analysed in his work is obviously the eternal Roman Rite Mass - the Tridentine Mass -, not the extravagant New Order Mass of Paul VI; the book can only be fully perceived having that factor in consideration.	2002-10-18

We likewise declare and ordain that no one whosoever is forced or coerced to alter this Missal, and that this present document cannot be revoked or modified, but remain always valid and retain its full force notwithstanding the previous constitutions and decrees of the Holy See, as well as any general or special constitutions or edicts of provincial or synodal councils, and notwithstanding the practice and custom of the aforesaid churches, established by long and immemorial prescription - except, however, if more than two hundred years' standing\\". <br /> Nevertheless, the book is very interesting and the author Denis Crouan, aproaching Michael Davies' thesis explained on \\"Catholic Sanctuary and the Second Vatican Council\\", contradicting common places spread among catholics since the decade of the 60's, argues that according the \\"Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy\\", promulgated during the Council, the Mass could be said backwards to the people, in order to make use of the old high altars in the sanctuaries of the churches; should be prayed preferentially in Latin;must be sung in Gregorian chant.<br /> Despite these facts, the reality is completely different: catholics have now the Mass said on altar-tables facing the people, prayed in bad vernacular - \\"Hi folks, good afternoon, lets begin our communitary meal!\\"; instead of \\"In nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti...\\"... - and they must painfully support the appalling guitar-mass and others strange extravagances...<br /> Denis Crouan rightfully sustains that nowadays it is virtually impossible, with the exception of some monastic abbeys, to find a church where the \\"New Mass of Paul VI\\" is correctly said, according the \\"Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy\\" and Paul VI's \\"New Missal\\": in each parish Mass is prayed in a different form, and inside the parish, each one its priests officiates on his own free will, cuting and changing prayers, introducing new ones, opening way to the most bizarre experiences and innovations, all in contradiction with the official documents promulgated during and after the Second Vatican Council and, also, in opposition to the innumerable pronoucements made by Rome against this state of things.<br /> But is Rome really interested in the end of such aberrations, when we see the current Pope John Paul II conceding cover to all the kind of liturgical absurds in his travels across the world?...<br /> Conclusion: modernists and progressists are not even able to respect their own decrees, much less the real Catholic Liturgy and True Faith.	2002-07-24

J. B. Lemius, where the first one dissects meticulously and magistrally, as only he knew, the modernist heresy in all its branchs.<br /> That book in its time was highly praised by Saint Pius X, and it is actually an essential tool to all the catholics understand how far the modernist heresy penetrated inside the Church, very especially since the Second Vatican Council.	2002-05-21

George is a great work of enormous erudition, written in the best thomistic catholic tradition of natural law, giving to the reader strong and definitive arguments against such realities like pornography, abortion, euthanasia, homosexual marriage and non-marital sexual acts, denying and superating personal liberalism's ideological common places about those themes.<br /> Nevertheless, despite the undeniable value of this work, I cannot rate it with five stars as I would like and, immediately, I will explain why.<br /> Professor Robert P. George is clearly a neo-catholic and, as commonly happens among the neo-catholics, he seems to idolatrize the figure of Pope John Paul II, pretending to pass as infallible and dogmaticly defined John Paul II's teachings about freedom of religion and the death penalty, going so far as to say that all the catholics, in order to be good followers of their religion, must conform their will with such teachings.<br /> I deeply disagree with Professor Robert P. George.<br /> About freedom of religion, I must ask if is he defending that the Blessed Pius IX or Saint Pius X were not good catholics, considering the fact that their teachings on freedom of religion are the complete opposite of those ones supported by John Paul II? Otherwise, did he forget the prescriptions imposed by the first and the second commandment of the Decalogue?<br /> On the contrary, as the Venerable Pius XII taught, I sustain that it is possible to tolerate in the community the existence of others creeds side by side with the true Catholic religion, in order to avoid worse evils to the society; but that doesn't mean to admit the freedom of religion, equiparating truthness to wrongness, because there is no real salvation outside the Catholic Church...<br /> Concerning the death penalty, obviously, to be a faithful catholic it is not necessary to support that punishment, nor to be against it. However,it would be useful to remember the lesson of Saint Thomas Aquinas about such question (and Professor Robert P. George rightfully sustains that the Angelic Doctor is a man of the twentieth century and of the twenty-first and beyond - see \\"The Clash of Orthodoxies - page 228), a teaching that is also the Catholic Church's traditional point of view on the subject: \\"Therefore if a man be dangerous and infectious to the community, on the account of some sin, it is praiseworthy and advantageous that he be killed in order to safeguard the common good, since \\"a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump (1 Cor. V. 6)\\" - see \\"Summa Theologica\\" - Pt. II - II, Q. 64, Art.2.	2002-05-14

To whom?<br /> 3rd) Was european colonialism so bad as african leaders use to say? Who put an end, not only to slavery, but also to cannibalism and human sacrifices in Africa? Who introduced the wheel and the alphabet in the subsaarian Africa? Who built the net of infrastructures still in use today in Africa, forty years after the end of european rule?<br /> 4th) Finally, is not the current attempt to demand reparations a way that the african ruling classes found to evade their own responsabilities in the dispaired situation of Africa? Is not such situation much more owed to the incompetence, greed and corruption of that same ruling classes than to a slave trade that ceased in the middle of the 19th century?...<br /> Read also the articles that Thomas Sowell, one of the persons to whom Horowitz dedicated \\"Uncivil Wars\\", wrote about the reparations problem.	2002-01-24

A strong commitment, or not, to such values as hardworking, stable family ties and a firm will of improving their own social fate rather than blaming third ones by that same fate.<br />Similarly, when the pretense source of damage disappears - for example, in societies where certain ethnic groups are largely the majority and \\"bias\\" against them is inexistent -, not only their poor social behavior does not vanish, but, contrarily, worsens in a terrible way...<br />Concluding, culture really matters!	2002-01-15

It is true that Islam does not force to conversion, but christians and jews were usually reduced, under islamic rule, to a status of permanent humiliation, to a kind of second class citizenship. For example, they were forbidden to exercise publicly their religions, to identify externally or repair their temples, to build new one or practise any kind of proselitism, being forced to pay, by the simple reason that they were not muslims, a tribute known as &quot;dhimmi&quot;, a kind of religious tax, from where the author derives the word &quot;dhimmitude&quot; to define the condition of the conquered peoples under Islam.<br /> This is, as I said initially, a very impressive book that analyses some of the main points of the muslim behaviour towards the followers of others religions and essential concepts like &quot;jihad&quot;, &quot;dhimmi&quot; or &quot;devshirme&quot;, giving a decisive aid to the understanding of the real nature of Islam.<br /> The fact that all the assertions done by the author are supported by historical sources from muslim and non muslim origins, it is an additional point of value to the book.<br /> I intend to read also Bat Ye'ors other books and V.S. Naipaul's &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;.iving a decisive aid to the understanding of the real nature of Islam.<br /> The fact that all the assertions done by the author are supported by historical sources from muslim and non muslim origins, it is an additional point of value to the book.<br /> I intend to read also Bat Ye'ors other books and V.S.

About this point, I should recommend the reading of Nathaniel Weyl's classic &quot;Red Star Over Cuba&quot;: in 1948, during the &quot;Bogotazo&quot; evenments in Colombia, considering the documents apprehended by the colombian police, Castro already was a &quot;komintern&quot; agent, a fact that also contradicts Montaner's assertion that USSR had not any role in the process that led to the overthrown of Batista's regime. Really, the main revolutionaries like Castro brothers - Fidel and Raul - and &quot;Che&quot; Guevara were all convinced communists controled by the afore mentioned country.<br /> Despite this defect, the book is really good and clearly shows the disastrous effects of communist dictatorship, exercised in the purest stalinist way, over Cuba.<br /> Carlos Alberto Montaner completely debunks the immense ammount of propagandistic lies spread by the cuban regime, proving that:<br /> 1º) The economical collapse actually suffered by Cuba is totally owed to the failure of the ortodox marxist central planning economics followed by the cuban communist party, giving no place to free enterprise and private property; not to the so-called american blockade, far away from that;<br /> 2º) Health care in Cuba, excluding hospitals to party's nomenklaturists and foreigners, has the worst quality possible: the lack of common medicaments is generalized and many hospitals, even, have not sheets to put on their patients' beds...;<br /> 3º) Education is completely submited to a strict ideological rigidity, not fulfiling the main target of any educational system: learn to think;<br /> 4º) Cuba currently has the lowest quality of life in the entire american continent, after Haiti and Nicaragua; in 1959, it was one of the three most developed latin american countries...<br /> Read also Carlos Alberto Montaner's &quot;Guide To The Perfect Latin American Idiot&quot; and Armando Valladares's impressive &quot;Against All Hope&quot;.	2001-11-07

Suming up, an obvious failure.<br /> Nevertheless, Piers Compton clearly demonstrates that Catholic Church, after the Second Vatican Council, was greatly infiltrated at the highest levels of the Roman Curia by masonic and socialist/communist agents, a fact that explains the turmoil faced by Church since then.<br /> This book deserves to be rated with two and half stars.	2001-10-24

Sordid, is the only word that occurs to the reader...<br />Another point of interest is the chapter about Osama bin Laden and the role he played in Afghanistan during the last twenty years. A former volunteer fighter in the &quot;jihad&quot; against the soviet invader, he became a liaision between the radical muslims that volunteered, like himself, to fight in Afghanistan, coming from all over the islamic world, and the pakistanese, saudi arabian and... american intelligence services that supported such fighters (the americans, at least, with military advisors...).<br />These volunteers were the basis to the formation of radical islamic groups that spread terrorism across various countries like Algeria, Egypt, Palestine or Philippines, but not only, as we already know, unfortunately, since 11th September 2001.	2001-10-16

Landes is totally prejudiced by a strong bias against southern european catholic states, very especially, Portugal and Spain. He intends that the expulsion of the jewish communities from those countries in the last decade of the 15th century, and the predominance of the catholic religion also in those socities, led them to an historical state of underdevelopment, not yet completely surpassed, by opposition to what happened with the northern  european societies, mainly the english and the dutch one.<br /> Firstly, although the expulsion of the jewish communities was a regretable evenment, it is useful to remember that the major part of their members found refuge in such countries like Morocco, the nowadays Bosnia, Greece and Turkey (the sefardi diaspora), but none of those places became an economical power by this simple fact. It is easily recognizable that they share an almost similar level of development with Portugal and Spain - Greece - or a worse one - Morocco, Bosnia and Turkey.<br /> Secondly, the two following centuries - the 16th and the 17th - were the portuguese and spanish golden age, an era of discoveries and imperial conquests, the highest peak on the power of the iberian nations, and, until the middle of the next century - the 18th -, the gap between northern and southern european countries was not so big as Prof. David S. Landes sustains. Really, he falls in contradiction when he quotes, on the page 232 of his book, a table of the estimated G.N.P. per capita for selected countries relative to the year of 1830 (in 1960 US$). It is possible to conclude that Portugal, even after  three hundred years of claimed bigotry and fanaticism, had an income of US$ 250, Holland of US$ 270 and England of US$ 370. The difference is not, obviously, smashing...<br /> So, which are the real causes for the decline of the iberian space. We can sum up them in the following points:<br /> 1º) The financial exhaustion provoked by the ever increasing maintenance costs of the overseas colonial empires;<br /> 2º) The centralized political tradition of the iberian kingdoms and the permanent economical interventionism of the public authorities, suffocating the appearance of a strong private sector of businesses;<br /> 3º) The destruction of the jesuit order's schools net, which provided free education to young boys of all social classes and was replaced by... pure emptiness (a fatal blow to the portuguese population's level of literacy), in the second half of the 18th century, during the Marquis of Pombal's government (the Marquis was an enlighted despot ...);<br /> 4º) The political instability that deeply shaked Portugal and Spain in the first half of the 19th century, (greatly originated by anti-catholic forces), impeaching the sucessful and punctual launch of the industrial revolution.<br /> Concluding, although the book now reviewed posseses serious points of interest and, partially, explains why some countries are richer than others, I profoundly disliked his reading; instead of Prof. David S. Landes' work, I would recommend Paul Kennedy's &quot;Rise and Fall of the Great Powers&quot;, Michael Novak's &quot;The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism&quot;, Amintore Fanfani's &quot;Catholicism, Protestantism and Capitalism&quot;, Edward Peters' &quot;Inquisition&quot; and Guy Sorman's &quot;The New Wealth of Nations&quot;.	2001-08-18

Telling no falsities, the book sometimes falls in excessive simplifications like overemphasizing the role of the Carlist Militia, a traditionalist catholic guerrilla group that roots his origins in the 19th century, or ridiculously presenting José António's Falange almost as a group of modern hooligans. Really, Falange was an antimarxist, antiliberal and antiparty system  political association, deeply influenced by Catholic Church's Social Doctrine, but not possessing the old fashioned &quot;patine&quot; typical of the Carlist Militia.<br /> Nevertheless,  Warren Carroll's book has two great and essential points:<br /> 1º) Remembers that the second Spanish Republic drove Spain to the chaos, leaving the real political power fall in the streets to be exercised, summarily, by communist and anarchist mobs (by the end of 1936, communists took complete control over the republic, now totally dependent on Stalin's U.S.S.R. economic and military aid, President Manuel Azaña being no more than a Moscow's puppet;<br /> 2º) Very especially, relates the brutal religious persecution moved in that same period by those communists and anarchists against the Catholic Church, one of the major causes to understand the 18th July 1936 nationalist sublevation (13 bishops and 10.000 priests were cold bloodly murdered in one of the worst 20th century's religious persecutions).	2001-06-21

Schmidt demonstrates, is the intent to create artificial societies where two or more totally different cultural groups live side by side, but backed to each other, considering the complete incompability existent between them, which generates an atmosphere of permanent and erosive cold civil war (frequently, increasing to hoter levels, as can be seen in places like Lebanon, Yugoslavia, many african nations and, unfortunately, the now multicultural zones of western countries).<br /> He refutes, also, the multiculturalist essential dogma that all human cultures are equal and, consequently, each one of them can only be fairly valued by her own members, but not by persons living outside them. Professor Schmidt shows, this is pure moral relativism, the denial of a superior natural order of values, implying absurd consequences, if taken to the letter and without reserves, as the acceptance as natural and uncriticizable of such realities like cannibalism, head hunting, scalping, human sacrifices, female clitoridectomy or the burning of live widows...<br /> Finally, last but not the least, Professor Schmidt proofs that multiculturalism is no more than a disguised form of marxism, using the same propaganda weapons used in his time by communism - every kind of lies, omissions and distortions -, showing the same brutal intolerance, intransigency and agressiveness to his opponents, full of hate against all western achievements, very especially against west's religious and moral values based on the judeo-christian tradition.<br /> This is a very good book to know and fight this intelectual plague that affects an important part of our western intellectual life.

I didn't repent of that.<br /> &quot;Brutality and Benevolence&quot; is a fine historical work, analising the spanish conquest of Mexico in a fair and well-balanced way, with rigour, objectiveness and seriousness, far away from the redutionist and distorted vision imposed about such theme by the political correctness movement, especially during and after the commemorations of the fifth centenary of Columbus arrival on America.<br /> More than a conquest that brought opression to the indigenousness, this evenment was a truly liberation of those same peoples from the despotic domination of the Aztec Empire, a leviathan that demanded from his neighbouring and subjugated subjects of other native nations, permanently and abusively, high tributes, not only in the strict economic sense, but also and essentially in human lifes destined to be sacrificed in the blood thirsty rituals of the aztec religion.<br /> The defeat of the Aztecs by the Spaniards, with the consequent fall of capital city Tenochtitlan, was only possible with the decisive contribution of the other non-aztec indigenous (Tlaxcalans, Huexotzicans, Atlaxcans and Totonacs), that allied spanish forces in order to overthrow the aztec domination they suffered.<br /> It is also important to note, although the subsequent conqueror rule was not free of atrocities and abuses (mainly, derived from the system of &quot;encomienda&quot; that vigorated in the first years after the conquest; it was later forbidden, in the end of 16th century), contrarily to a common spread view, that same conqueror showed a real concern with the indians rights, especially through the justice system of &quot;Audiencias&quot; (frequently deciding in favour of the natives), but also with the creation of a net of hospitals destined to render health cares to those same natives.<br /> The author analises all these evenments from an ethological point of view, in my opinion, with credibility: man, being a part of the nature, obviously shows common features with other living beings (principally, primates like chimpanzees or gorillas, considering their almost complete genetic similarity with humans); however, some assertions of Abel Alves seem quite exaggerated. For example, the benevolence showed by the conqueror, more than a reminiscence of an innate feature, was not a direct consequence of his catholic religion? I think it was...  Concluding, the book is very interesting and I recommend it (despite the price...) to persons searching an unusual relate of the conquest of Mexico.	2001-05-24

Their moral opinions, which they had never questioned and which had been reinforced throughout their lives by home, school and church, were now being attacked by the voice of authority. As time passed, the private beliefs of the majority would hardly ever be reflected on the broadcast media, so convincing them that they were in fact a minority and had somehow been left behind. As time went by, they lost confidence in a morality they had once been proud to support, and became ashamed of it. Enfeebled, isolated and pushed to the margins, the majority were not merely silent, but dumbstruck and powerless, afraid to defend themselves&quot;.<br />This is undoubtly true, but the author does not explain why the media (who controls them?) have such agenda, and this is the great fault of the book (together with the uncapacity to identify clearly the lobbies that promoted this revolution). May be, Peter Hitchens feared to be called a conspiracy lunatic or a right wing extremist, if he intended to do that...<br />Nevertheless, this a very interesting reading and I highly recommend it.	2001-04-29
US	53065615	RPLXDBJK2GHCP	0375700218	30170986	The Confessions	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Saint Augustine's spiritual journey	Saint Augustine's &quot;Confessions&quot; is a very beautiful and fascinant book that narrates, as his title suggests, in a sincere and humble way, the spiritual journey and conversion of the author from darkness to light, vice to virtue, and error to the truth of the catholic faith, proving that saints, even the greatest and wisest as Augustine, are also simple and common men (sinners) ruled by an imperfect human nature. Really, after the read of this book, it is impossible to deny that each one of us have something of Augustine in his own character, and this is one of the greats merits of the &quot;Confessions&quot;.<br /> A real classic, essentially an intimate and personal work, it simultaneously develops some of the major concepts that influenced decisively western civilization for fifteen centuries (the essence of God and His role on creation, the universality of moral law, the decayed human nature or the notion of free wiil, for example), which is one more reason to recommend that book to every person interested in west's religion, moral,philosophy and law. Five stars!	2001-04-18

Sowell, we can conclude that, contrarily to the unconstrained vision, the constrained one prefers common sense to emotion, reality to utopia, the best world possible to the ideal world, the real man of ever to the new man, and reformation to revolution, resulting that differences from the way each one faces that same man: the constrained looks him as an imperfect and decayed creature, with unchangeable vices and tendencies, so, to her, the most effective policy that can be taken is the one that tries to conciliate such a nature with common social good, puting the first  working for the profit of the second; inversely, the unconstrained, facing man as a small god, believing blindly in the unlimited capacities of reason and in the complete maleability of man's characther, intends to built, in her most radical version, paradise on earth, but, despising simple truths about human nature, only reachs...hell.<br />This a superb book that I highly recommend to everybody, specially persons from the conservative and non-political correct family.	2001-04-09

Attanasio's &quot;Ink from the new moon&quot; (portraying a different reality where America was found and colonized by chinese people and, consequently, converted to Buddhism), fall in that category and, with L. Sprague de Camp's &quot;Aristotle and the gun&quot;, are also my favourites.<br />The last one, more than alternate history, is speculative history, putting an interesting dilemma: if we could change, somewhere in the past, the course of human evenments, would be the future (our present day) a better place to live? Well, as in other matters, the dreams of reason can generate monsters...<br />I recommend the book, knowing that he gives some hours of light but good reading, a thing which is always necessary.	2001-03-25

It was written in the begining of century, but stills actual after one hundred years. The author - the english journalist Hesketh Prichard, from the &quot;Daily Express&quot; - depicts his impressions of a journey across and about Haiti. He found a  country where the black race rules after a century, which was a rarity in  1900 (just Liberia and Ethiopia, at the time, had black governments, too).  Although the author shows simpathy for the ordinary haitian people, the  opinion that he gives from the country is far away to be positive. Here, in  his opinion, we find a place,curiously, like post-colonial Africa 60 years  later, where who really rules is widespread corruption, exarcebated but  ridiculous militarism (an army with 7.000 men had 6.500 generals and 7.000  brigadiers), venal judges, police brutality, intimidation of free  press,continuous political instability (during one hundred years, none  president of Haiti was able to end his term), and, last but not the least,  susperstition and witchcraft. I will end my commentary, quoting the author  himself: &quot;Today in Haiti we come to the real crux of the question. At  the end of a hundred years of trial, how does the black man governs  himself? What progress has he made? Absolutely none. When he undertakes the  task of government, he does so, not with the intent of promoting the public  weal, but for the sake of filing his own pocket. His motto is still,  &quot;Pluck the fowl, but take care she does not cry out&quot;. Corruption  has spread through every portion and every department of the Government.  Almost all the ills of the country may be traced to their source in  tiranny, the ineptitude, and the improbity of those at the helm of state.  (...) Can the negro rule himself? Is he congenitally capable? (...) Today,  and as matters stands, he certainly cannot rule himself&quot;. Worth  reading book, wrote in a fine literary english.	2000-05-02
