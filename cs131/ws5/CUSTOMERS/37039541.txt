I have been ready Beatles books for years and many authors just seem to cut and paste their books together with no thought of orginality, or rarity.

I remember going to school and everyone talking about the Beatles.  I remember passing through the hallways, always hearing girls fighting over who was the best Beatle.  And I would have to say that John always won.  John Lennon, at the beginning, was just a regular, break-the-rules, type of guy.  I never belived he would turn into a, make-the-rules, type of guy.  I have read several Beatle bios, and I would have to say that this is the only one that actually came out with the truth that I think John would actually like.  I belive, that if John was handed a copy of this, I think he would get a kick out of it.  I mean, Giuliano is only doing what John preached.  TRUTH.  But, I do believe after reading this that Yoko did stop the truth telling.  I mean, I believe John really wanted to come out with these things and express it to everyone but Yoko stopped him in her witchy ways.  This book is a great masterpeice.  Very well written.  Very well put together.  I just can't think of what else to say about this book and its author.  Giuliano, you wrote a wonderful book(s), keep on writing.   Power to you my friend, can't wait for more, and keep the truth telling coming.	2002-08-05

We all love this man, feel bad for the man.  Even without reading this book everyone knew that something was wrong, but no one told us what.  You did!  Thanks!  You writing is terrific, well put together.  I would like to take a moment and laugh with you that Yoko Ono couldn't do anything about stopping this book from coming out.  She wants everyone to think her late husband was a wonderful God.  He was wonderful, but not a God, a person who needed love, and obviously this book shows that Yoko couldn't do that.  I believe Yoko was just jelous, agrivated, and mostly a witch when it came to her husband.  She always wanted to be the one at the top. If it wasn't for John she would be living in a studio apartment in the Bronx with absoluetly no income.  Thank you Geoffrey for helping me understand him, and let me get closer to the man inside the skin.	2002-08-05
