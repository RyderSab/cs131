Or, to use Bob's favorite word--AMAZING!  It's an amazing book from an amazing man.  I had an amazing time reading it.  It is the most dramatic book EVER!  And I mean that.  I am a fan of the Bachelor.  Whenever it comes on, I lock the kids in their rooms, muzzle the dog and drug my husband so he passes out.  I don't want to be interrupted at all.  And BOB made it all worth it!  I loved him so much, I just had to know his philosophy of life.  And this book spells it out.  Does it ever!  Bob used to be a big fatso, but now, although he's still chubby, he's lost most of the weight.  One of my friends, who is now an ex-friend, said that this book is a stupid waste of time, that Bob thinks (...) that he's just trying to drum up attention for his CD, \\"3 Sides\\", which is a shoo-in to reach the #1 position on the charts.  With a bullet!  It's sad that trees are chopped down to make paper, but when they're pulped to make the paper to make books like this one, which will improve your attitude, your mind and make you happy to be alive, that's a good thing!  BUY IT!	2004-06-07

For some reason, although it saddened me, it didn't seem real:  I'd never known anybody my own age who had died, and I couldn't comprehend the grief of the older sister, Kate, when her little sister Joss died suddenly.  Last year, however, my 7-year-old son died unexpectedly.  The pain of such loss is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't suffered such a terrible thing.  Everything Kate describes in this book is so true: the rage at God, the anger that somebody else who 'deserved' to die didn't die instead, and most of all, the stillness, the emptiness where that little person used to be.  When I read Kate's poem about her sister's empty bed, I wept and wept.  I'm crying as I write this.  Constance Greene has written a small masterpiece about the worst possible thing that life could throw at a person; it is a thing of rare beauty.  And it will make you hug your children a little more often.	2000-11-11
US	51798337	R2SSS9TWCOW6WR	0812570944	434550963	What Dreams May Come	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Interesting	A lot of this book made sense to me--the idea that we create our own destinies and that forgiveness of even the worst sin is possible through genuine repentance and hard work to make one's self worthy of it.  Being  raised in a Christian environment, I was never able to reconcile the idea  of eternal punishment for the misdeeds of a relatively brief lifespan with  the preaching of Jesus himself, who called for forgiveness 'seventy times  seven'.  But many things in this book bothered me.  I've been all over the  map with religion, from fundamentalism to atheism to outright defiance and  rebellion against God, and now would describe myself as a 'doubtful  believer', but in my search for the truth, I was always turned off by such  phrasings as &quot;etheric double&quot; and &quot;aura&quot; and &quot;soul  mate&quot;--too New Agey and flakey to be believed.  Also, Matheson's  suggestions for further reading include books by the thoroughly discredited  Edgar Cayce (from whom he got the term 'Summerland' for Heaven--kind of a  kindergartenish name to use for a place of introspection and growth).   Still, his concept of life after death seemed much more just than those  other models we are given from Western religions--in which souls are dealt  with according to how very immature and vengeance-minded human beings would  deal with people they disagreed with, rather than how Ultimate Wisdom would  take care of his creation.  This book is a good, if deeply flawed, starting  point for those who are interested in the concept of life after death.	2000-03-02

This is the best--the very, very best writings of an extremely talented, yet still underrated, author.  Dorothy Parker:  her loneliness and anger are only slightly concealed by her brittle humor.  Read &quot;Lady With a  Lamp&quot; if you want to experience the nature of true sadism:  not  physical pain, but ultimate despair is brought to an ill woman by one of  her 'friends'.  &quot;Horsie&quot; is a sad examination of the relationship  between a homely woman of repressed passion and the shallow couple who  employ her.  &quot;The Last Tea&quot;:  anyone who's been in a dying  relationship, who isn't willing to admit that it has ended, can understand  the female protagonist's every move.  Those are my favorites, but every  story in this volume is delightful.  And then there are her reviews.  My  favorite is the scathing, nasty review of A.A. Milne's &quot;Give Me  Yesterday&quot;--that play was actually produced?  Her poetry is excellent,  as well--I prefer her prose and her reviews, however.  This is one of the  five books I'm taking to my desert island.  Read it!	2000-01-06

Miss Erickson uses about six main sources and quotes  endlessly from them--the number of quotation marks on each page grows  tiresome--which is a sure sign of lazy writing.  The picture section in the  middle, for some reason, includes pictures of Catherine Parr and Mary Queen  of Scots--important figures in Tudor history, to be sure, but,  historically, they didn't even show up until after Anne Boleyn's death; and  they appear nowhere in the book, as well!  Talk about sloppy!  I was  completely unimpressed with this 'pop history' of Anne Boleyn, but plan on  reading the other biographies I purchased.  If I'm happier with the others,  maybe I'll post a more positive review of one of them.	2000-01-04

Chaplin was brilliant, no doubt.  I love his films and consider him one of the great artists of this century.  This book  merely confirms my view that great artists aren't exactly wonderful human  beings.  Chaplin doesn't make one mention of Rollie Totheroh in this book,  for example, and doesn't even mention his second wife's name.  (Her name  was Lita Grey--some believe she was the inspiration for Nabokov's  'Lolita'-- and she only gave him his first two sons).  Chaplin, his  autobiography makes evident, was a man who could tolerate no one who could  possibly pose a threat to his own image of himself as some kind of creative  god; therefore he lists, name after name, Great People He Has Known and Who  Have Admired His Holy Presence (Cocteau, Einstein, Churchill, etc.). Maybe  this explains why he married 'women' who were too young and inexperienced  to stand up to him and declare that he was an egotistical annoyance. I  don't like this guy at all, needless to say, but was still fascinated by  this autobiography, for the reason that I'm a silent-film buff and couldn't  ignore him.  Admire his work, but not the man.	1999-10-22

Who could never, in a normal lifespan, reading 24 hours a day,  possibly read every book in her library.

This book declares that measurable intelligence (IQ)--learning potential--is inborn, a fact that I won't dispute.  It's usually pretty easy to tell which child is bright, and which may be slow, from a fairly  early age.  (I say 'usually' because there are exceptions--children of  extremely high intelligence who were misdiagnosed as being dull at an early  age.  Albert Einstein, for example.)  Environment is a factor, albeit a  much smaller one.  So as I muddled through the graphs and charts (no  statistician, I), I found myself wondering what exactly the authors were  trying to communicate.  Is it that a person's race may determine their  intelligence?  I hate to say this, since I'm all for intellectual  curiosity, but I wonder what the point of such knowledge would be.  On  average, that a black person's IQ is 15 points than the average white  person's?  Averages are averages, and figures are only figures.  What would  it mean, and how could this be important to our society?  This book raises  more questions than it answers.	1999-09-20

I never know what to think of an autobiography.  First of all, the writer must have a huge ego, to write and  publish the story of his or her life.  Second, what writer of his own life  story will tell the honest-to-God truth?  I must admit, this is the only  biography I've read of Mr. Wright, so I have no idea as to how accurate it  is as to dates, occurrences, etc.  So let me tell you why I love this book.   It's because of Mr. Wright's love of books!  Everything!  His hunger for  knowledge was incredible. . .he'd work 10 hours, eat a can of barely warm  pork and beans and start reading everything he could put his hands on.  (He  had to talk another man at his job into letting him use his library card to  check out books, because Mr. Wright was black and Negroes couldn't use the  public library.)  Mencken, Twain, Zola, Sinclair Lewis. . .I felt lazy  after reading how this young man educated himself, against almost  impossible odds, while I sit on my rear end and do nothing, with everything  available to me at no price.

Sylvia Plath has inspired a lot of curiosity about her life since she committed suicide and left a mass of interesting poetry and bad prose in her wake.  I will admit that  she has intrigued, and still intrigues me.  I just have to wonder about a  few things:  why would her mother publish this book of correspondence  during her lifetime?  Perhaps she was seeking to establish a view of her  daughter as a real, breathing, doubting human being, not just as some kind  of feminist icon (and if you believe Plath was a feminist in the modern, PC  version of the word, just read her journals).  I wouldn't doubt that; the  bond between Aurelia Plath and her daughter was undoubtedly strong, though  imperfect (as are all parental relationships).  But these letters. .  .perhaps they will be of interest to scholars in the future, excavating the  mines of a minor 20th-century poet seeking motivations for some of her more  famous poems. . .I don't know.

Obviously, this little baby isn't ever going to gain too much  power unless he takes a file to his skull protrusions, wears gloves  constantly and contacts.  Unless he became a freaky rock star.  I haven't  read &quot;Son of Rosemary&quot;. . .wonder if that's how he turned out?   Anyhow:  this book is a black comedy that provides several chills along the  way.  Guy, Rosemary's husband, is such a duplicitous jerk (a character type  that Levin used again in 'The Stepford Wives') but Rosemary has no inkling  as to what he has done to further his career.  Her neighbors seem to be  such friendly, caring old folks.  Her obstetrician delivers all the  'society babies'.  Only one person suspects that things aren't what they're  cracked up to be, but he makes an unfortunate exit midway through the  novel.  This book is good, but not as well-done as the movie, with its  creepy soundtrack, wonderful direction and terrific actors.  FYI:  the  movie is incredibly similar to the book, down to the decor of the  apartments and pages of dialogue.  The reason for that is that Roman  Polanski, the director, had no idea that he could take liberties with the  novel and thought he was legally obligated to stay true to the author's  intentions.  Would that more movie directors working today thought the  same!	1999-08-17

When I read Camille Paglia's first book, I felt a sense of intellectual and sexual liberation and excitement, as if she were speaking to a part of myself that  had lain undiscovered and unexpressed.  This book is a huge disappointment:   a lame collection of celebrity-worshipping essays, followed by an entire  section dedicated to cartoons and media references to her name.  I was  embarrassed for her after reading this book.  Camille Paglia is a woman of  formidable intellect, but for all she decries white-tower academia, she is  and will always be a product of its privilege and exclusivity.  She  obviously longs to be a Keith Richards-esque outsider and continuously  points out how her various employers have censored and blacklisted her, and  I think her books (except for the first, which is a minor masterpiece) are  an effort to enforce that image.  However, being pro-pornography and  pro-abortion aren't exactly revolutionary stages to take, no matter how  much our Puritan culture would like people to believe that; rather, they  seem a relapse into a very solipsistic, male-oriented world that Paglia is  very much a part of--a Testosterone Valhalla in which all that is  non-corporeal can be visualized and fetishized (a futile undertaking, if  ever there was one!)  I am still hopeful that Camille Paglia's next work  will put this one to shame.	1999-08-14

This book illuminates the ignorance and superstition of those 'men of God' who were happy and willing to see thousands of innocent people tortured, burned, and hanged.  It's certainly an interesting historic document, but  extremely frightening.  If you believe this kind of thinking has been  outmoded, read the next review on this page.  I think it was written by Pat  Robertson.	1999-08-10

Hal Lindsey has been writing about the 'end times' for at least thirty years.  Every time he comes out with a new book, his situations change according to the latest media-inspired panic.  People who enjoy this kind  of stuff, please understand that ever since Christ promised to return  almost 2,000 years ago, people have been looking for signs that the end is  near.  Not a volcano can explode, not a sun can be eclipsed without some  Chicken Littles running around and squawking doom.  The fact that the Book  of Revelation was obviously written by someone who intended Christ to  return during his own lifetime 1900 years ago goes over too many people's  heads.  Stop dreaming about a nonexistent future paradise and start working  on establishing one on Earth!  I believe that's the message Jesus wanted to  impart anyway.	1999-08-10

As Deborah Spungen wrote, your child is always your child and you will always love her, no matter what she does--but what if your daughter rejected your love and  guidance so angrily and repeatedly?  How difficult would it be to keep  hoping and to keep trying to convince your daughter that she was loved and  that her life was worth living?  Nancy was obviously a person who suffered  some damage at some point (probably during her traumatic birth and first  few days of life) and who lived a life of incredible sorrow and violence.   I can't imagine what Deborah Spungen and her family had to live through,  seeing the young woman they loved tear herself, and her family, apart.  Can  you imagine wishing that your beloved child would die because her misery  was poisoning your family's life?  How would that make you feel?  Deborah  has been through a lot in her life, and this book is a painful memoir of  her child's brief existence.  It must have torn her apart emotionally to  write this.  I think that some reviewers on this page are extremely  judgmental.  I'm sure Deborah wasn't the perfect parent--nobody is--but  from the sounds of it, she went above and beyond the call of what any  parent anticipates they will have to do (and it sounds like her other  children have turned out just fine).  Read this book.  It's a heartbreaker,  but maybe it will teach a few people that mental suffering is very real and  can be as devastating as any physical ailment.	1999-08-09

It names the names and details the perversions.  There are no heroes or heroines in this book, dear reader.  The four women who wrote their 'memoirs' are some of the silliest,  stupidest, most banal creatures ever to stalk the earth.  I loved the story  about the woman who 'serviced' George Harrison about two minutes after she  met him.  Then she got angry that he never asked her name.  You just want  to shake the pathetic girl and holler, 'You're a HOOKER!  You're a GROUPIE!   They don't WANT to know your name!'  The men don't come off as any better:  slaves to their wee-wees, intoxicated with the power of their money and  fame, able to get anything for a price.  Hollywood is revealed as a place  where shallowness, money, idiocy and bimbos reign (surprise, surprise,  surprise).  So, no big revelations--unless learning about Stallone's very  abnormal fetish is your idea of a good time.  (And after you read it, think  about the big lunk earning $22 million a picture.  Do we as a nation have  our priorities screwed up or what?)	1999-08-06

It is an absolutely gorgeous book--imaginative and beautiful, with a very moral center.  It is a Christian allegory.  I'm not  a Christian, but I can appreciate the skill and the depth of feeling Lewis  has for his subject.  Aslan the lion is a wonderful character.  He is  gentle and kind, but can also be fierce and fatal when the situation calls  for it.  The children are believable--they are basically good at heart, but  are certainly not perfect, and Edmund is extremely trying.  I'm so glad I  re-read this!  The first time I heard the story was in fourth grade.  Every  child in my class was rapt with attention when our teacher read this to us.   There is one part of the book where everyone in class put their heads down  and cried.  Then, the next day, when we heard the next chapter, everyone in  class laughed and smiled with relief and joy (everyone who has read this  book will know what part I'm writing about!)  Read this book, and then  re-read it.  You will never forget it!	1999-08-06

Karen Kingsbury had never become a novelist:  she has no ability to create depth of character.  Therefore Missy is a one-dimensional saint and her killers are demons.  Actually, all of the  characters in this odd tale were quite unlikeable.  And those re-created  conversations are clumsy and unrealistic.  But this book, I will admit, is  a page-turner in the way that the Jerry Springer show sometimes fascinates  me against my will:  I kept thinking as I was reading, 'Do people really  live like this?'	1999-08-06

This book, both for all of its cynicism, has a generosity towards the human race, encompassing and striving to understand those who are its most marginalized members: sexual  minorities, hustlers, bums, floozies, drunks, junkies. . .all of those who  are traditionally swept under the mat.  I haven't read it since I was  twenty, but in those long-ago, mid-80's days, I read it to tatters, and  I've never forgotten it (and I'm a straight-but-not-narrow female).  Read  it.  You'll remember it always.	1999-08-04

These are the same people who could have served on the O.J. Simpson jury:  completely out to lunch.  This book isn't perfect, and Joe McGinniss is certainly not  unimpeachable (after all, he's the man responsible for 'discovering' and  encouraging Bret Easton Ellis' writing).  What it comes down to is this  (and I can't figure out how MacDonald's supporters downplay this):  the guy  was a Green Beret.  His family was brutally slaughtered and he had minor  wounds.  Was he a complete and utter wimp who was physically unable to  protect his wife and children (something I can't believe) or was he himself  guilty of the killings?  This book gives good background on the evidence  used to indict and convict the pathological, narcissistic nobody, Jeffrey  MacDonald.	1999-07-06

Louise was a shimmering beauty, but she was more than that:  she was an opinionated, intelligent, thoughtful human being who knew that  Hollywood breeds crap and who believed in film as art. . .positions she  ultimately couldn't reconcile.

After we'd finished reading the book and the instructor asked for opinions, most students (a rather apathetic group) opined listlessly that they &quot;kinda liked it&quot;.  I  raised my hand and listed several reasons why this book was not only  ridiculous and offensive, but was written like a piece of juvenilia:  the  conversations are unbelievable; the main characters are spoiled, whiny,  loathsomely politically correct caricatures; the plot is nonexistent; the  author is obviously a professor of creative writing, or holds some other,  equally useless profession that enables him to think he knows what he is  talking about, but has merely enabled him to think that any subject, no  matter how dull, will do when creating a work of &quot;art&quot;.  And  those, fellow readers, are this book's good points.  Upon hearing my  opinion, my fellow-sufferers in my class rapidly agreed with me, which made  me wonder why they were so afraid to speak up in the first place.  Avoid  this book at all costs, because if you don't, when you're lying on your  deathbed, you'll regret the lost hours you spent on it.	1999-03-20

I thought I'd read every great ghost story that existed, until I came across &quot;Smee&quot;, which still sends shivers up my spine.  That tale is  worth the price of the collection alone, but this book also contains  &quot;The Wind in the Rose-Bush&quot;,  &quot;The Doll's Ghost&quot; and  &quot;Who Rides With Santa Anna?&quot;, other wonderful stories.  This book  will keep you awake on many rainy nights.	1999-03-20
