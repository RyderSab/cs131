You have my permission to laugh at the fact that I have never seen these movies.  But I think that this might have given me a more unique perspective in that I didn't know what to expect from this book.<br /><br />This book was GREAT!  A truly modern classic.  I wish that Mr. Puzo had written more additions to this story line, but I will enjoy picking up \\"The Sicilian\\" to continue the series.<br /><br />There are a few scenes in this book that should be intended for adults only, and frankly, I think the story could have done without them.  But the overall feel of the success of the Corleone Familia was quite intriquing.	2005-09-12

This book contains some good foreshadowing for Episodes 3 and 4.

The beautifully written story was only part of the reason I liked this book so well.<br /><br />The story grips you to the seat!  What suspense!  I couldn't put this book down several nights in a row and it took me less than a week to complete it.  I am going out to get the next 2 books in the series this week.<br /><br />This book was written in the 1st person, which also adds a unique style to the story.

That is one way to describe Mr. Burton's newest release.  The events that take place and situations the characters get themselves into takes a truly active imagination to create.  And Mr. Burton does it well.<br /><br />I must admit that there is so much going on that at times I get lost with the characters.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it causes me to pay more attention to the story as it unfolds.  The character names are all a bit foreign so they demand that you remember each one.<br /><br />This book held more suspense than the first one, and that is the one thing that I thought the first book in this series lacked.  So I am twice as thankful that I read book 2 in the Orianus Creation Series.  Shane tells me that book 3 will be out soon and I will be picking that one up immediately and I won't wait so long to read it.  I think that I need to retain the info from book 2 to be held over into book 3.<br /><br />Well done Shane.  Keep pumping them out.

Eric Wilson delivers proses and beautiful description with a tell tale story and great character development.  Having read Eric's first book, Dark To Mortal Eyes, I knew that this work would be another expose, unfolding in a way that only this author can describe.  I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />I must admin, however, that I was a bit disappointed with the ending.  I found it somewhat anti-climactic.  I believe that the part of two characters from Mr Wilson's first book appearing in this story gave it a nice, familiar feel, but I thought that more lose ends were left open then what should have been.  It didn't really take away from the story, in fact it left it open for an inspiring sequel, but still I would have liked to see closure in a few more areas.<br /><br />This book is going on my shelf and staying there, to await a second read one day in the future.  I am an Eric Wilson fan and I will gladly add this piece to my collection and anxiously await his next addition.  I will also enjoy discussing this book on my Christian book chat forum.

Don Miller's book is a human look at the Christian life in America today. His honest approach to the life of a born-again believer reveals the love of Christ in a way that is often looked at by men in today's culture, but seldom spoken. Miller's journey towards God was one of trial, pain, betrayal, back-slidden faith and a swallowing of pride that each person, especially in America, must face on a successful journey to everlasting Faith in Christ. Miller doesn't beat around the bush. His truthful and honest, no reserved description of his revelation and realization of Christ made me realize that others are in fact just like me and I am not alone with the human feelins I have that I am both ashamed of and defined by.<br /><br />I am proud to say that I am new fan of the author and I very much look forward to his next work.

And the only reason that I picked this book up at this particular time is because it was my best choice in an airport newstand for a flight from Atlanta to Dallas.  Don't get me wrong, I have many Koontz novels, most of which I have not read, but his previous works that I have experience with led me to believe that I would like all his work.<br /><br />I wasn't totally wrong.<br /><br />This book starts with a bang.  It hooked me immediately, providing spell-binding and spine-tingling situations in a down-pour of anxiety, excitedness and suspenseful rush.  I read the first half of the book on a 2 hour plane trip, stopped for the drive from the airport to my home, only to sit down again with this thriller.<br /><br />And then I got to the middle.  I won't say that I lost interest, but I will say that the plot slowed considerably.  I had to drudge through the middle of the book, and just in the last few chapters it started to pick up again.  The short chapters were a wise move, I believe, because I could read the book in short chunks at a time.<br /><br />I don't want to offer and spoilers for the story, but if you have read the book, consider what I am about to say...<br /><br />Mr Koontz left one very important detail out of his interpretation of Revelation 12:12.  There can be no erradication of Satan without the name of Christ and without the blood He shed.  So don't expect \\"Hope\\" to save you from the forces in another universe, as Mr. Koontz might make us think.  I enjoyed your story, Mr Koontz, and it certainly won't keep me from reading more of your work, but it was just slightly flawed.	2005-05-30

I just couldn't take it anymore.  I would have stopped a long time before now, but I don't like leaving books unfinished.  In this case, not finishing is better than the alternative...<br /><br />Nothing every really happened in the book, at least not the part I read.  There were a few scenes where something actually transpired besides dialog or author rambling, but the scenes were shallow and short.<br /><br />I kept waiting for some big event to take place after all the description, but over half way through the book, it never did.  I just feel like I wasted the last 5 weeks trying to get through this book, when normally it takes me only a week to get through one that can keep my attention.<br /><br />I was not impressed.	2005-05-06

They depicted the military and civilian world<br /><br />together for a believer coming from one to another.  In this novel, the author takes us shortly into the future -- into 2005!<br /><br />It is enjoyable to see what the future holds for 2005, as depicted in 1996.  Not too far off, really, but some minor<br /><br />descrepencies are notable.  This doesn't remove interest from the story, however.<br /><br />I liked this book for many reasons, the least of which was not the fact that it takes place in my home metroplex.<br /><br />The main character, Ethan Hamilton, works in Irving, TX and lives in the Mid Cities Area, as do I.<br /><br />The author constantly references highways and landmarks in the Ft Worth area that I recognize and see on a weekly basis.<br /><br />This brought the story to a closer reality for me, causing me to visualize it right down the road.<br /><br />Jefferson Scott easily turns this cyber-thriller into a family story good for everyone read, one that will<br /><br />hold the interest of everyone in your clan.  I recommend this book to any and all readers of any age.  Jefferson Scott is climbing to the<br /><br />top of the list for Author's that I constantly watch for!	2005-03-21

As one earlier reviewer noted, this book should not be your first if you have never read Gansky before.  Too late for me.  But this will not hinder my desire to read more of this author's work.<br /><br />This book cover and summary gave the impression that it was a story of some End-Times classification, with some form of Prophetic Alliteration.  Not so.  This was a great detective story, with no detective.<br /><br />The story focuses mostly around a female mental hospital patient and her escape from the mental ward.  This happens after an astronomer discovers a red discoloration on the surface of the moon.  Gansky succeeds in throwing in a little story with the Moon discovery, but mostly writes about the escapades of this escaped patient.<br /><br />I didn't mind this story, in fact I found it very page-turning.  But it is not the story I was expecting from the name of the book and the description on the back cover.  But rest assured, I will continue to read the works of Mr. Gansky with awe-filled expectation.  Next time, I just hope I get a story in the advertised genre.	2005-03-13

This is the final chapter in the Firebrand Series?  No, please don't end now!<br /><br />Jefferson Scott takes us to a new level with this action-packed, heart-pounding, graphically-imaged thriller of a story with a touch of romance on top.  I really enjoyed the romance part...I really can't believe I said that, but it is true.  The romantic element in the first 1/3 of the book truly set the stage for how greatful we should be as Americans.<br /><br />This tale was the greatest of the Firebrand stories.  The first two novels were good, for sure, but this one almost sets itself apart from the first two.  I actually cringed in several scenes in this book...and I can normally take quite a bit of graphic, grotesque imagery.  Thrilling scenes such as these hold my attention and prevent me from putting the book down.  Mr. Scott topped himself again and proved that he can still pack a wallup!  I, for one, certainly hope that this is not the end to this wonderful and highly unique series.<br /><br />I will be watching and hoping for a 4th book in this series.  Jefferson Scott has climed higher to the top of my list of favorite authors and I will be anxiously awaiting his next piece of work, no matter what it is.	2004-12-24

A team of Chistians, doing God's work, commando-style.  The idea is thrilling just by itself, and the stories the author comes up with are outstnading.<br /><br />I am going to read the third book now.

James Byron Huggins is one of, if not my top, favorite authors.  His stories are masterfully told with a prose that challenges the reader to think and maintain an educational thought of the story in the reader's minds- eye.  His writing is beautifully done to weave an intricate story, captivating the imagination of any reader.<br /><br />This book deals with Nephilim, one of my favorite topics, and ties in biblical characters and stories to form a modern-day adventure.<br /><br />Even if you have never read any work by Mr. Huggins, (which, if that is the case, you are missing out!) but you like action/adventure/science fiction stories about monsters and demons, this book is for you.<br /><br />I anxiously anticipate any more great work that comes from this author!	2004-12-02

Bush	My dad got this book for Christmas last year and due to election time having been recently upon us, I decided to borrow the book and read about our re-elected President.<br /><br />One thing I seemed to sense when reading this book was the author's tone of how he had the utmost respect and admiration for the George W. Bush, yet he seemed to lack agreement with the Faith the President possesses.  This was a simple feeling I had about the author, it may be totally unfounded, but I noticed several instances where he said that George W. worshiped \\"his God\\" and prayed to the God of \\"his faith\\".  It was almost like he was on the outside, looking in, and while Mr. Mansfield certainly uplifted and admonished the current President, he never did quite \\"agree\\" with George W. Bush's placement of Faith.  At least not in directly quoted words.<br /><br />Out of the seven chapters in this book, I would have to say that the final chapter is what made the book worth reading.  The first six deal with the President's former life of growing up, becoming a successful businessman and baseball team owner, being elected to the Governor's chair in Texas, and moving into the Presidency in 2000.  The first six chapters were a great history lesson and I enjoyed them, but the last chapter is what really did it for me.<br /><br />This may be going back to what I said in the second paragraph, as in the last chapter the author claims Bush to be an \\"enigma\\" or a mystery to the faithful.  Mr. Mansfield recalls times when the President invited Ozzy Osborne to a Presidential luncheon at the White House.  How he appointed an openly [...] man to a prestigious position under his administration.  How the President's administration itself is THE most diversified, nationality wise, in the history of US Presidents, having more \\"minority\\" groups under his regime than ever recorded before.  The author goes on to talk about how President Bush is often at odds with his religious advisors and supporters, who he well-respects.  This really got me to thinking about how much I truly admired our President.<br /><br />Are we not called to love one another?  Is it not the second greatest commandment?  Does that mean that we are only to love one another, if we agree with one another?  If we are in the same political group...the same church denomination...the same Bible translation?  Is scripture not being quoted as to \\"love the sinner, but hate the sin\\"?  Does this mean that we should not tolerate certain people until they become believers and agree with us on every issue?  Perhaps if this were true, there would be no more \\"New Christians\\".<br /><br />I believe that President Bush has succeeded where many \\"Christians\\" have failed.  This is our highest calling, and the real mystery is why more of us are not acting in the same manner.  Jesus did not spend his time with the Pharisees, Governors and religious leaders of his time.  He surrounded Himself with beggars, thieves, and prostitutes.  And while those may be extreme circumstances that only our perfect Lord could control himself in, I think that President Bush understood the message.<br /><br />Acceptance of one another shows God greatest love for his people.  President Bush doesn't need everyone to agree with his views; he simply needs to show God's love to those around him.  This is his true calling.<br /><br />I can see more clearly now why so many people are derogatory towards our current Commander-in-Chief.  Why there are websites, apologizing to the world that we re-elected this \\"tyrant\\", as if it was any of the rest of the world's business.  Apparently our founding fathers forgot to include French, English, and other European citizens on the US voter registration table.  I guess it simply slipped their minds how important those peoples' opinions were.<br /><br />The Word of God quotes Jesus, saying, \\"The world has hated you because it first hated me, but fear not, I have overcome the world!\\"  Of course the world hates George W. Bush.  He is a lighthouse for Christ and truth and that irritates people.  The world hates the truth, and they hate President Bush because of it.<br /><br />That may, in fact, be another one of the President's accomplishments.  He found the best possible reason to be hated by this world in which we do not belong.irritates people.  The world hates the truth, and they hate President Bush because of it.    That may, in fact, be another one of the President's accomplishments.  He found the best possible reason to be hated by this world in which we do not belong.	2004-11-25

First let me say that the editors and publishers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.  There were grammatical errors all through this book.  Paragraphs started where they shouldn't have...punctuation was off...quotes were missing and question marks were used on statement sentences.  This was all very distracting, but the theme of the story held my attention, nonetheless.<br /><br />Also, I could have done without all the swearing.  Swearing in dialog is one thing, although not a necessity, but the author's swearing in prose?  Please.  Show some education.<br /><br />Now that my rant is over, I must admit that I liked the story of this book.  It was quite unique and very gripping.  I had trouble putting it down in parts as the suspense built and kept me hooked.  Out of all the books I have read, this is definitely one of the most suspenseful and therefore, one of the most needful, overall.<br /><br />I recommend this book to mature readers.  Vivid sexual images won't be acceptable for younger readers, but if you like suspense, this one will fill your needs.	2004-11-08

I enjoyed it very much and I look forward to reading more of his work in the future.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this novel spins a tale of suspense around characters that are pawns in a sinister plot of a madman to create a race of super-humans, who will worship their creator.  The characters are coincidentally thrown into a plot together against their will and find that their fantastic new abilities tie them to links from their past which were always voids of questions.<br /><br />Koontz does a great job of character development, realization and evolution from quiet citizens to team leaders.

Except that Paul is a believer himself and is a secret mole for the Underground Church.<br /><br />This story really makes you think about what the world would be like if religion was completely outlawed.  It seems far-fetched and almost sci-fi in modern America, but the real truth of religious prejudice was alive in the New Testament and will be again, according to John's Revelation on Patmos.  This book puts a fictional twist on a future world where ALL religion is outlawed and believers must worship in Underground Churches.<br /><br />At the very least, this book makes you thankful for the freedoms we have in America.

And this book made me weep, laugh, and stand in awe at the amazing fullfillment of scripture that took place in this historical fiction story, which has not happened yet.<br /><br />I loved the part when Jesus was talking with each person, audibly talking with them.  He answered prayers before they were spoken.  He tended to needs and concerns of his followers.  Is this unrealistic?  Hardly.  In fact, it happens today, to me and others I know, though most of the time it isn't audible.  The visual and audible actions of Jesus and the Hosts of Heaven thrilled my heart in this 12th book.  I know alot of people are downing this book and this series, but I enjoyed it very much.  Yes, it is based on interpretation of scripture, but the basic message and theme is rooted in God's Word.<br /><br />I am thankful to have completed this series.	2004-09-07

I really enjoyed the fast-paced events in this book and I anxiously await the next book, which I am starting to read tonight.<br /><br />Since the first few books in the series, the story has not been fast-moving, gripping, or eyes-glued-to-the-page action, which I can't put down.  It took me a week to read the first book, 3 days to read the 2nd, a week to read the 3rd, and each one after that was between 1-2 weeks for me.  This book, #11, took about 4 days.  I could not put it down.<br /><br />There are some pivotal events in this first few chapters of this book and some martyrdom scenes that moved me.  I enjoyed the story, even after losing some major characters.<br /><br />My favorite thing in the world is to see prophecy fullfilled, which is why I have enjoyed these books so much.  Yes, they are fiction, but to see the words of Revelation put into modern, hypothetical circumstances, really gets my blood pumping.  I have greatly enjoyed this series and I thank the authors for their hard work!	2004-08-23

Yes, I am still reading these books and I am still enjoying them.  I found alot more positive reviews for this book than for the last few, and I am happy that I am not the only person who enjoyed this book.<br /><br />The Antichrist, in this book, desecrates the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, mocking God and Jesus' entry into Jerusalem just a week before he was crucified.  Antichrist rides into the city on a large pig, thus making fun of the journey Jesus made.  Then he sacrifices said pig in the templr and smears blood all over the Holy of Holies, which the Jews rebuilt after the veil was torn more than 2000 years ago.  I'll refrain from going of on that tangent and just say that the veil does not hide the presence of God in the temple as it once did.<br /><br />I enjoyed the character developement in this book.  The characters are not very deep in this series, but I felt that Rayford matured as a leader and some others played more serious roles also.<br /><br />The arguement about lying to and killing the enemy of God, known as the GC in this book, in this WAR that the Trib Saints are playing in.  Wow, I could write a novel on that one.  But I'll leave that interpretation up to each reader and refrain from making a political statement here that might in fact offend some people.  Let me ask a few questions, however;<br /><br />1)Is this a war?<br /><br />2)Are soldiers required to kill or be killed in a war?<br /><br />3)The original Hebrew commandment \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" is more accurately translated \\"Thou shalt not murder\\".  What is the difference?<br /><br />4)Wasn't King David, a man after God's own heart, one of the most ruthless killing machines during times of war?<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to get into all this here.  But in a nutshell, I don't see a problem with lying to Satan and his minions or killing them, should they threaten me or my loved ones.  I hope I never get the opportunity to find out how I would really react.	2004-08-16

Book #8 reveals the \\"Mark of Loyalty\\" to Carpathia, or the Antichrist, and all who refuse it are beheaded.  Or so it seems...<br /><br />This book follows suit with those before it and it is an intriguing and addicting tale about those Left Behind after the Rapture.  I am enjoying the whole series and recommend the books to believers and non-believers alike.<br /><br />One comment on the previous reviewer, stating that he cannot recommend the books cased on the fact that a believer \\"takes\\" the mark of the beast in this book.  You don't have the whole story.  You must read on into the next book, #9 Desecration, to see what really happened with this believer.  The authors only give you a glimpse of the issue in book #8.<br /><br />I'm continuing with this great series!!	2004-08-12

Yes, this book contained less action than some of the others, but it was also focused over a period of just a few days (3 actually), rather than over a span of several months like the previous books.<br /><br />Did Rayford kill Carpathia? Will Buck and Chaim escape New Babylon? Is the safe-house no longer safe? Read to find out!<br /><br />I especially liked Leon Fortunado making a complete a** of himself in this book. True, he looked prestigious to those around him and he has an aura of confidence around him, but I had to read his part in this story with a smug smile on my face. I can't wait to see what happens to him. And Carpathia? What a copy-cat. Come up with some lines of your own, my friend, and stop quoting the God that you not only deny, but claim yourself to be.<br /><br />One last thing....These reviewers still downing and obliterating this series. What gives? This is the 7th book in a 14 book series, half way through. If this story is so putrid, why are you still reading it? Put down the book, and go find something else that will fill your time. Don't read on, continuing to demote and put down the series. If you don't like it, stop reading it. And get over it.	2004-08-03

I read the first 5 books together, then put the rest on hold for a while until more were released. I picked up this book, number 6, a few days ago and I am hooked once again!<br /><br /> This book contains graphical prophetic description when the 200 million demonic horsemen, on flamed horses with lion's heads, appear and kill 1/3 of the population of the world, all non-believers. The story goes on to the 3 1/2 year mark of the Tribulation, when the 2 Witnesses are assassinated and then resurrected. Read that part...I loved it! The book ends with the death of Nicolae Carpathia.<br /><br /> I am enjoying this series. Some reviewers have praised it, while others have called it narrow-minded and boring. Well, this is fiction, true enough, but if the end of the world is boring, I'd hate to see what you are into. Plus, the Word of God is narrow minded. &quot;Narrow is the Path, and Few find it&quot;<br /><br /> If you don't like the series, that is fine, everyone likes different things. But I am voting a positive &quot;YES&quot; on this series. I will enjoy reading the next 6 books and on into the other spin-offs. Nothing is more fascinating and enjoyable to me than seeing prophecy fullfilled, and while this work is fiction, it is based on factual literature found in the Bible. Book #7, here I come!	2004-07-31

It brought to life heros that have been forgotten in the realm of prose work thus far.  Characters like Aquaman, The Atom, Steele, Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, Firestorm, The Teen Titans, Nightwing and many more.<br /><br />The story was excellent also, spanning the entire globe on multiple continents.  Characters from all nationalities, fighting together with the Justice League, former members of the League reunited, and new members introduced.  This book was a complete story and one that leaves the reader THIRSTING for more!<br /><br />I am sad to see that this book was the last in a series, a series which was suppossed to consist of 6 books, but somehow books 4 and 5 have not been released yet.  Books like this are so rare, and this one was a true breath of fresh air.<br /><br />DC authors....PLEASE....continue your fine work in making these superheros come to life in non-graphic print!  Marvel is WAY ahead, with over 30 books released for their heros.  DC has some EXCELLENT characters that deserve much more play than they have had in the past.<br /><br />Pickup this book if you ever liked DC comic heros.  It is a fantastic experience!	2004-07-30

It's about time a story like this was written for The Flash.  Why has it taken so long??<br />I loved the Super Hero stories when I was younger and I enjoyed keeping up with the DC and Marvel Universes through comic books and cartoons.  Now, I am too old for comics and I don't like graphic novels, which are just a longer comic printed on heavier paper.  This novel for The Flash was a breath of fresh air in a long awaited world of DC fans who had no novels about their heros.<br />With all the books out there today, I can't believe it has taken so long to write novels on these characters.  This is the first true novel I have seen for The Flash, and I bought it immediately at the book store when I saw it.  I found another novel for the JLA and picked that one up also, and I am anxiously waiting for the Grenn Latern novel to be released.<br />The 2nd string characters are my favorite.  Marvel has a few dozen novels on several different characters, and I have always been disappointed that DC doesn't seem to release any novels except ALOT of Batman and an occassional Superman now and then.  What gives?  Batman is good, but he is not that good.  Superman is top-dog and he doesn't even get much play with true novels.  Characters like GL, The Flash, Aquaman, Firestorm, etc. seem to go ignored.<br />FINALLY with the release of this novel, The Flash gets some play.  And I enjoyed the well-written story.  I only hope that our publishers and authors don't stop with this novel and continue on making great stories available to us for whom comics are just a thing of the past.	2004-07-16
US	36248768	R1XTVICL83IKNH	006055584X	972512365	Mission Compromised	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Wickedly Scary...........	The scary part of this novel is not being able to tell fiction from truth.  My first accessment of the book was a Christian Fiction novel, based on military practices and policies and functions.  Throw in Oliver North, a true hero, both writing and appearing in the novel, and your mind can really play tricks on you, telling you that some of the things you are reading are not all that &quot;fictional&quot;.<br />The Christianity and sound gospel doctrine in this book added a nice warmth to the story.  I enjoy good novels with well-written doctrine intrinsic to the theme of the story and while this story would have been nice without it, it would not have been the same, nor would this novel be as popular, in my opinion.<br />My vote if for this book to turn into a series, going beyond the boundaries of &quot;trilogy&quot; that so many writers seem to halt at these days.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I will be both reading The Jericho Sanction and recommending this book to my friends!<br />Mr North, Thank you for the fascinating, too-close-for-comfort, tale!	2004-07-12

We share similar tastes in novels and both enjoy reading, although I am a light-weight compared to the volume he devours.<br />In this novel, the author takes the reader through twists and around corners, revealing only enough in each chapter to make you want to continue into the next chapter.  The twists and turns, along with the sensationally descriptive imagery, kept my attention well into the night on more than one occassion.  I had to make myself to go bed over the last nights, wishing that I could stay up and finish this book faster.<br />I am always good a guessing plot outcomes, and I did in fact guess 1-2 things in this novel, but the intensity and number of suprises provided an enjoyable revelation in the final chapters.  Thoughtfully provoking and spiritually in-tune with the Word of God, this story takes the reader on a well-earned cruise through the imagination.<br />I can't wait to read Eric Wilson's next novel.  I am a new fan.  Writers like this should continue using the talents that are God given, and I look forward to enjoying that talents in the future.	2004-06-28

A surprise at every turn, Mr Ludlum makes me want to keep reading from page to page, chapter to chapter, and on into the next 2 books in this trilogy.<br />This was my first Robert Ludlum book, and in a round-about way, I picked it up because of the movie.  This is to say that I picked it up because I liked the movie, and told a friend about the movie, who replied to me \\"Don't want to see it....it can't be as good as the book!\\"  So I took a friend's advice, bought the book, started to read it and was side-tracked for a while.  But I picked it back up about a week ago, when I heard about the 2nd movie coming out, and re-read the entire book, including the unfinished part, in about 8 days.<br />Mr Ludlum sure does keep the thrills and surprises coming.  I am not sure what my problem was with not finishing it the first time, I am not a fast reader and I had a little trouble biting off 530 pages, but it was well worth it.  And I look VERY forward to the next installment, The Bourne Supremacy.<br />I could have done without the swearing, but other than that, the story line was quite unique and was not at all guessable.  I was surprised with the outcome of the main characters, but not the main villian, since there are sequals.  But I am happy with the result.<br />If you like espionage and suprise twists and turns, read this book.  It is a good story.	2004-06-09

He is an all-time great and his stories have touched millions or people and been published in several languages.  This is my first review of any of his work, but it is not the first novel of his that I have read.<br />Maclean has a beautifully descriptive touch to his writing.  He also has a great way of making the reader sit on seat's edge, anticipating the next page and chapter of the novel.  This story was all of that, for me.<br />I did like the first person narrative.  It proved an unusual perspective to the story.<br />I am looking forward to reading more of Maclean's work and writing more reviews on them.

Everyone kept telling me that I should read Dekker because he is a beautiful writer and his stories are compelling and thought-provoking.  It seems they were right.<br />This book started with a bang and kept my attention to the very end.  I did not feel it was a &quot;page-turner&quot; or a &quot;gripping&quot; novel.  I have read much more suspenseful and captivating  stories, which made me forget to go to sleep at night because I was so into the book.  This book was not like that.

This book spoke to me on so many levels; I am having trouble focusing it into paragraph form.  This is my attempt, however.<br />Anyone who thinks the heart is inherently wicked and evil has not read the Bible.  I must admit that I had never thought of it this way, but it makes perfect sense.  What happens when you are saved, washed in the blood of Christ?  Behold, you are a new creation, the old passes away and all things become new, and Christ comes to live in your heart and fill you with the Holy Spirit.  Now...IF this is true (which I believe it is, because the Bible says it is) then why, OH WHY, do we think the heart is evil?  Why would Jesus come to live in an evil environment?  It would contradict scripture to assume that Christ would live in an evil heart.  If he was willing to do that, then forgiveness of sin would be a moot point and Jesus suffered and died for nothing.<br />This book sheds light on subjects that I had not explored in depth before.  I grew up a Baptist, and I currently attend a very vibrant Baptist church that is in-tune with the will of God, but spiritual warfare is seldom mentioned.  Hey, churches aren't perfect in this world.  Eldredge excels in speaking to the fact that we are at war.... a spiritual war against principalities and rulers of this present darkness of evil forces in heavenly realms.  We must put on the full armor of God and guard our hearts, for they are the wellspring of our lives.<br />I could write a full-sized newspaper ad about this book.  It has spoken to me in a way that few others have.  The author encourages us to pray certain little prayers and probes us to ask questions to God throughout the book.  And I did that.  And God answered.... multiple times.  He is still answering.  Maybe I am crazy.  That's fine, I can live with that, because if I am, it is for the sake of Christ.<br />Do you want to walk with God, see his face, and draw closer to his heart?  Read this book.  Study the scripture that goes along with it...and there are plenty scriptural quotes in here to keep you busy for a short while.<br />Above all else, Read This Book.  Did I mention that?

I have a habit of buying books and putting them on the shelf, and not reading them for a long time, or maybe never reading them at all.  I have started to break this mold recently, as I have read 1 book a week for the past 3 months.<br />My reason for choosing this book at this time is that I am looking at joining the Christian Writer's Guild, led by Jerry Jenkins, and I just recently found that Mr. Scott is a mentor (or Master Writer) for this group.  I wanted experience some of his work, and I am very impressed.<br />I really like military thrillers with a Christian theme.  Now, I would not call this book a &quot;thriller&quot; but it was definately militarily based with Christian themes and characters.<br />With a Navy SEAL leading your team, you can hardly go wrong.  This story uses God's people to rescue those in need.  A very creative and well-thought story, which I think the world might actually need if a unit like this doesnt' already exist.  I have never heard of such a unit, but maybe that is the point.  Either way, this book could very well be based on a reality that the public is unaware of.<br />There are 2 more books in this series after this book.  I am very much looking forward to reading more of Jefferson Scott's work.  I am a new fan!!!	2004-04-03

This book is beautifully creative, with worlds, lifeforms, humanoids, and other creatures in a sci-fi realm.  It took me a little longer to read this book than others, but it was a gripping story with action and turns in every chapter.<br />I enjoyed the off-planet venue of this story.  I like sci-fi and I like creativity, but the best thing about this book is definately the Chistian message.  This author proves that you can have a well-developed story, with make-believe characters and places, and still ingrain a good Gospel message with it.<br />As I understand it, this book is the first of a Trilogy.  I expected it to end on more of a cliff-hanger, but it did not.  It was a finished and completed story, which left a few ends open for a sequal, but it did not leave me hanging.  I was happy.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone with an imagination, both Christian and Non-Christian alike.  I am looking VERY forward to the next one!  Great job, Shane!	2004-03-27

It was an easy read and moved very quickly, but still had time to promote character development.  I especially enjoyed the main character, Mac, finding his faith and learning how to fight the Fallen Ones with The Spirit of God, not by might nor power.<br />I thouroughly enjoy when real-to-life characters, like Mac, who are broken and mistake-ridden, find their faith in Jesus in fictional books, creating a unique story like so many of the fables that Jesus told.  This book deserves to be in every Christian Church library.<br />The story takes a interesting twist on the UFO and alien subject that many people are interested in today.

I am not a huge reader, although I am trying to read more these days, but I have never been so compelled by a fictional story before.  The author's end note states that the stories in the novel are based on acutal evetns.  That is enough to make your blood boil.

Although this novel hit the ground running, I found the story a little &quot;typical&quot; and too bland.  The author keeps your attention through a plane crash early in the book, but other than that, the first half seems mostly uneventful.<br />After drudging through that part, the author takes a new twist and envelops the character in a chase across the country.  With a surprise twist at the end that I never guessed coming, Mr. Thrasher has won me over as a new fan.<br />I would definately recommend this book.  The message is heart-warming and the end really throws you for a loop.  Don't let the first few chapters get in the way of this great story!	2004-02-15

Previously, I have read Cain, and I just finished The Reckoning, and one thing is for sure...I am a new James Byron Huggins fan!  His work is page-turning, edge-of-your seat action, with thrills that keep you wanting more.  I loved this one, more than Cain, and I plan to read all 6 of his novels.<br />Mr. Huggins, if you read reviews on Amazon, PLEASE....write another one!  GREAT JOB!!	2004-02-14

This book shows how God still works miracles in the lives of his people.  It shows the truths about believers and non-believers in a battle for eternity.  I have enjoyed reading books 1-5 in this series and I plan to continue to #6 shortly.	2004-02-14

It blames all the wars in the world on religious beliefs and theorizes that wars will end when religion is banned.  A compelling story that, I am affraid, is a little too realistic.  Jenkins does a great job with character development from atheists to believers in Christ.  I can't wait for the sequal....	2004-02-13

I agree with one previous reviewer in that if you are this far into the series, you are probably hooked and the reviews probably won't sway you.  I know that is true for me.  I read this book immediately after Nicolae, and continued with Apollyon following, so I don't remember specifically which events happened in which book.  But I can say this about the entire series....it is adicting.  I can't seem to put it down.  This series, while some would say &quot;preachy&quot;, depicts the TRUTH about Jesus Christ.  Sure, the characters are fictional, and the story itself is an interpretation, but the truth of Christ it always unchanging.<br />I love to see prophecy fulfilled, and anyone can find that today just be reading the newspaper, but this book takes a step (a small step) into future prophecy.  I can't wait for the next one!	2004-02-13

It puts a very down-to-earth spin on characters and happenings around the world.  Some may say that the events in this book are illogical, but it reality, if 1/3 of the world's population was to actually disappear, complete chaos would rule, at least for a short while.<br />This book is an interpretation of the book of Revelation for the bible.  It is a modern-day, realistic spin on what &quot;could&quot; happen.  Most events in this book are based on facts in the bible.<br />Read this book, and remember the events.  One day, these events will happen to the world, and those left behind will experience encounters that are very closely related to this fictional story.	2004-02-13

I loved this one.  I read this boook in 3 days.  To this date, I have never read a book so fast.  I love to read; however, I am not a very fast reader, but this one I could not put down.  It really takes the characters to a new level, but as with all &quot;series&quot; oriented books, the middle usually isn't as good as the beginning or the end.  This is the &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; of the sereis.....a GREAT book, to be sure, but the following books are much more intense!	2004-02-13
US	36248768	R32AOVSVB7VFKD	0842329242	940457812	Nicolae: The Rise of Antichrist (Left Behind No. 3)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Anti-Christ Revealed....	In this one, the Antichrist starts to take over.  Immediately, you love to hate this guy.  The authors build him up as an aristocratic, well-educated, dignatary, who is so controlling and manipulative, that you would think everyone hates him.  On the contrary, however, he is quite the persuader and smooth-talker.  A very realistic interpretation of Satan himself.  This one leaves your mouth watering for more.  I read this book and the next 2 after it all together....it makes for one BIG story.	2004-02-13

This story has it all...mystery, suspense, action, and intrique.  Top it off with a great biblical message and a true-to-life depiction of Satan's demeanor.  I would highly suggest this book to anyone who likes action thrillers.	2004-02-13
